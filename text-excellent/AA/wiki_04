Gioachino Rossini

Gioachino Antonio Rossini (; 29 February 1792 – 13 November 1868) was an Italian composer who gained fame for his 39 <a href="opera">opera</a>s, although he also wrote many songs, some <a href="chamber%20music">chamber music</a> and piano pieces, and some <a href="sacred%20music">sacred music</a>. He set new standards for both comic and serious opera before retiring from large-scale composition while still in his thirties, at the height of his popularity.

Born in <a href="Pesaro">Pesaro</a> to parents who were both musicians (his father a trumpeter, his mother a singer), Rossini began to compose by the age of 12 and was educated at music school in <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>. His first opera was performed in Venice in 1810 when he was 18 years old. In 1815 he was engaged to write operas and manage theatres in Naples. In the period 1810–1823 he wrote 34 operas for the Italian stage that were performed in Venice, Milan, Ferrara, Naples and elsewhere; this productivity necessitated an almost formulaic approach for some components (such as overtures) and a certain amount of self-borrowing. During this period he produced his most popular works including the comic operas "<a href="L%27italiana%20in%20Algeri">L'italiana in Algeri</a>", "<a href="The%20Barber%20of%20Seville">Il barbiere di Siviglia</a>" (known in English as "The Barber of Seville") and "<a href="La%20Cenerentola">La Cenerentola</a>", which brought to a peak the "<a href="opera%20buffa">opera buffa</a>" tradition he inherited from masters such as <a href="Domenico%20Cimarosa">Domenico Cimarosa</a>. He also composed "<a href="opera%20seria">opera seria</a>" works such as "<a href="Otello%20%28Rossini%29">Otello</a>", "<a href="Tancredi">Tancredi</a>" and "<a href="Semiramide">Semiramide</a>". All of these attracted admiration for their innovation in melody, harmonic and instrumental colour, and dramatic form. In 1824 he was contracted by the <a href="Paris%20Opera">Opéra</a> in Paris, for which he produced an opera to celebrate the coronation of <a href="Charles%20X%20of%20France">Charles X</a>, "<a href="Il%20viaggio%20a%20Reims">Il viaggio a Reims</a>" (later cannibalised for his first opera in French, "<a href="Le%20comte%20Ory">Le comte Ory</a>"), revisions of two of his Italian operas, "<a href="Le%20si%C3%A8ge%20de%20Corinthe">Le siège de Corinthe</a>" and "<a href="Mos%C3%A8%20in%20Egitto">Moïse</a>", and in 1829 his last opera, "<a href="Guillaume%20Tell">Guillaume Tell</a>".

Rossini's withdrawal from opera for the last 40 years of his life has never been fully explained; contributary factors may have been ill-health, the wealth his success had brought him, and the rise of spectacular <a href="Grand%20Opera">Grand Opera</a> under composers such as <a href="Giacomo%20Meyerbeer">Giacomo Meyerbeer</a>. From the early 1830s to 1855, when he left Paris and was based in Bologna, Rossini wrote relatively little. On his return to Paris in 1855 he became renowned for his musical salons on Saturdays, regularly attended by musicians and the artistic and fashionable circles of Paris, for which he wrote the entertaining pieces "<a href="P%C3%A9ch%C3%A9s%20de%20vieillesse">Péchés de vieillesse</a>." Guests included <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a>, <a href="Anton%20Rubinstein">Anton Rubinstein</a>, <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Giuseppe Verdi</a>, Meyerbeer and <a href="Joseph%20Joachim">Joseph Joachim</a>. Rossini's last major composition was his "<a href="Petite%20messe%20solennelle">Petite messe solennelle</a>" (1864). He died in Paris in 1868.

Rossini was born in 1792 in <a href="Pesaro">Pesaro</a>, a town on the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a> coast of Italy that was then part of the <a href="Papal%20States">Papal States</a>. He was the only child of Giuseppe Rossini, a trumpeter and horn player, and his wife Anna, "née" Guidarini, a seamstress by trade, daughter of a baker. Giuseppe Rossini was charming but impetuous and feckless; the burden of supporting the family and raising the child fell mainly on Anna, with some help from her mother and mother-in-law. <a href="Stendhal">Stendhal</a>, who published a colourful biography of Rossini in 1824, wrote: 

Giuseppe was imprisoned at least twice: first in 1790 for insubordination to local authorities in a dispute about his employment as town trumpeter; and in 1799 and 1800 for republican activism and support of the troops of <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> against the Pope's Austrian backers. In 1798, when Rossini was aged six, his mother began a career as a professional singer in comic opera, and for a little over a decade was a considerable success in cities including <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> and <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>, before her untrained voice began to fail.

In 1802 the family moved to <a href="Lugo%2C%20Emilia-Romagna">Lugo</a>, near <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a>, where Rossini received a good basic education in Italian, Latin and arithmetic as well as music. He studied the horn with his father and other music with a priest, Giuseppe Malerbe, whose extensive library contained works by <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Haydn</a> and <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>, both little known in Italy at the time, but inspirational to the young Rossini. He was a quick learner, and by the age of twelve he had composed a set of six sonatas for four stringed instruments, which were performed under the aegis of a rich patron in 1804. Two years later he was admitted to the recently-opened <a href="Conservatorio%20Giovanni%20Battista%20Martini">Liceo Musicale, Bologna</a>, initially studying singing, cello and piano, and joining the composition class soon afterwards. He wrote some substantial works while a student, including a mass and a cantata, and after two years he was invited to continue his studies. He declined the offer: the strict academic regime of the Liceo had given him a solid compositional technique, but as his biographer Richard Osborne puts it, "his instinct to continue his education in the real world finally asserted itself".

While still at the Liceo, Rossini had performed in public as a singer and worked in theatres as a <a href="r%C3%A9p%C3%A9titeur">répétiteur</a> and keyboard soloist. In 1810 at the request of the popular tenor <a href="Domenico%20Mombelli">Domenico Mombelli</a> he wrote his first operatic score, a two-act operatic "<a href="Dramma%20per%20musica">dramma serio</a>", "<a href="Demetrio%20e%20Polibio">Demetrio e Polibio</a>", to a libretto by Mombelli's wife. It was publicly staged in 1812, after the composer's first successes. Rossini and his parents concluded that his future lay in composing operas. The main operatic centre in north eastern Italy was <a href="Venice">Venice</a>; under the tutelage of the composer <a href="Giovanni%20Morandi%20%28composer%29">Giovanni Morandi</a>, a family friend, Rossini moved there in late 1810, when he was eighteen.

Rossini's first opera to be staged was "<a href="La%20cambiale%20di%20matrimonio">La cambiale di matrimonio</a>", a one-act comedy, given at the small <a href="Teatro%20San%20Mois%C3%A8">Teatro San Moisè</a> in November 1810. The piece was a great success, and Rossini received what then seemed to him a considerable sum: "forty "<a href="Italian%20scudo">scudi</a>" – an amount I had never seen brought together". He later described the San Moisè as an ideal theatre for a young composer learning his craft – "everything tended to facilitate the début of a novice composer": it had no chorus, and a small company of principals; its main repertoire consisted of one-act comic operas ("<a href="farsa">farse</a>"), staged with modest scenery and minimal rehearsal. Rossini followed the success of his first piece with three more "farse" for the house: "<a href="L%27inganno%20felice">L'inganno felice</a>" (1812), "<a href="La%20scala%20di%20seta">La scala di seta</a>" (1812), and "<a href="Il%20signor%20Bruschino">Il signor Bruschino</a>" (1813).

Rossini maintained his links with Bologna, where in 1811 he had a success directing Haydn's "<a href="The%20Seasons%20%28Haydn%29">The Seasons</a>", and a failure with his first full-length opera, "<a href="L%27equivoco%20stravagante">L'equivoco stravagante</a>". He also worked for opera houses in <a href="Ferrara">Ferrara</a> and Rome. In mid-1812 he received a commission from <a href="La%20Scala">La Scala</a>, <a href="Milan">Milan</a>, where his two-act comedy "<a href="La%20pietra%20del%20paragone">La pietra del paragone</a>" ran for fifty-three performances, a considerable run for the time, which brought him not only financial benefits, but exemption from military service and the title of "maestro di cartello" – a composer whose name on advertising posters guaranteed a full house. The following year his first "<a href="opera%20seria">opera seria</a>", "<a href="Tancredi">Tancredi</a>", did well at <a href="La%20Fenice">La Fenice</a> in Venice, and even better at Ferrara, with a rewritten, tragic ending. The success of "Tancredi" made Rossini's name known internationally; productions of the opera followed in London (1820) and New York (1825). Within weeks of "Tancredi", Rossini had another box-office success with his comedy "<a href="L%27italiana%20in%20Algeri">L'italiana in Algeri</a>", composed in great haste and premiered in May 1813.

1814 was a less remarkable year for the rising composer, neither "<a href="Il%20turco%20in%20Italia">Il turco in Italia</a>" or "<a href="Sigismondo">Sigismondo</a>" pleasing the Milanese or Venetian public, respectively. 1815 marked an important stage in Rossini's career. In May he moved to <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, to take up the post of director of music for the royal theatres. These included the <a href="Teatro%20di%20San%20Carlo">Teatro di San Carlo</a>, the city's leading opera house; its manager <a href="Domenico%20Barbaia">Domenico Barbaia</a> was to be an important influence on the composer's career there.

The musical establishment of Naples was not immediately welcoming to Rossini, who was seen as an intruder into its cherished operatic traditions. The city had once been the operatic capital of Europe; the memory of <a href="Domenico%20Cimarosa">Cimarosa</a> was revered and <a href="Giovanni%20Paisiello">Paisiello</a> was still living, but there were no local composers of any stature to follow them, and Rossini quickly won the public and critics round. Rossini's first work for the San Carlo, "<a href="Elisabetta%2C%20regina%20d%27Inghilterra">Elisabetta, regina d'Inghilterra</a>" was a <a href="dramma%20per%20musica">dramma per musica</a> in two acts, in which he reused substantial sections of his earlier works, unfamiliar to the local public. The Rossini scholars <a href="Philip%20Gossett">Philip Gossett</a> and Patricia Brauner write, "It is as if Rossini wished to present himself to the Neapolitan public by offering a selection of the best music from operas unlikely to be revived in Naples." The new opera was received with tremendous enthusiasm, as was the Neapolitan premiere of "L'italiana in Algeri", and Rossini's position in Naples was assured.

For the first time, Rossini was able to write regularly for a resident company of first-rate singers and a fine orchestra, with adequate rehearsals, and schedules that made it unnecessary to compose in a rush to meet deadlines. Between 1815 and 1822 he composed eighteen more operas: nine for Naples and nine for opera houses in other cities. In 1816, for the <a href="Teatro%20Argentina">Teatro Argentina</a> in Rome, he composed the opera that was to become his best-known: "<a href="The%20Barber%20of%20Seville">Il barbiere di Siviglia</a>" ("The Barber of Seville"). There was already <a href="The%20Barber%20of%20Seville%20%28Paisiello%29">a popular opera of that title by Paisiello</a>, and Rossini's version was originally given the same title as its hero, "Almaviva". Despite an unsuccessful opening night, with mishaps on stage and many pro-Paisiello and anti-Rossini audience members, the opera quickly became a success, and by the time of its first revival, in Bologna a few months later, it was billed by its present Italian title, and rapidly eclipsed Paisiello's setting.

Rossini's operas for the Teatro San Carlo were substantial, mainly serious pieces. His "<a href="Otello%20%28Rossini%29">Otello</a>" (1816) provoked <a href="Lord%20Byron">Lord Byron</a> to write, "They have been crucifying "<a href="Othello">Othello</a>" into an opera: music good, but lugubrious – but as for the words!" Nonetheless the piece proved generally popular, and held the stage in frequent revivals until it was overshadowed by <a href="Otello">Verdi's version</a>, seven decades later. Among his other works for the house were "<a href="Mos%C3%A8%20in%20Egitto">Mosè in Egitto</a>", based on the biblical story of <a href="Moses">Moses</a> and the <a href="the%20Exodus">Exodus</a> from Egypt (1818), and "<a href="La%20donna%20del%20lago">La donna del lago</a>", from <a href="Walter%20Scott">Sir Walter Scott</a>'s poem "<a href="The%20Lady%20of%20the%20Lake%20%28poem%29">The Lady of the Lake</a>" (1819). For La Scala he wrote the <a href="opera%20semiseria">opera semiseria</a> "<a href="La%20gazza%20ladra">La gazza ladra</a>" (1817), and for Rome his version of the <a href="Cinderella">Cinderella</a> story, "<a href="La%20Cenerentola">La Cenerentola</a>" (1817). In 1817 came the first performance of one of his operas ("L'Italiana") at the <a href="Com%C3%A9die-Italienne">Theâtre-Italien</a> in Paris; its success led to others of his operas being staged there, and eventually to his contract in Paris from 1824 to 1830.

Rossini kept his personal life as private as possible, but he was known for his susceptibility to singers in the companies he worked with. Among his lovers in his early years were <a href="Ester%20Mombelli">Ester Mombelli</a> (Domenico's daughter) and <a href="Marietta%20Marcolini">Maria Marcolini</a> of the Bologna company. By far the most important of these relationships – both personal and professional – was with <a href="Isabella%20Colbran">Isabella Colbran</a>, prima donna of the Teatro San Carlo (and former mistress of Barbaia). Rossini had heard her sing in Bologna in 1807, and when he moved to Naples he wrote a succession of important roles for her in opere serie.

By the early 1820s Rossini was beginning to tire of Naples. The failure of his operatic tragedy "<a href="Ermione">Ermione</a>" the previous year convinced him that he and the Neapolitan audiences had had enough of each other. An insurrection in Naples against the monarchy, though <a href="Ferdinand%20I%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies%231820%20revolution">quickly crushed</a>, unsettled Rossini; when Barbaia signed a contract to take the company to Vienna, Rossini was glad to join them, but did not reveal to Barbaia that he had no intention of returning to Naples afterwards. He travelled with Colbran, in March 1822, breaking their journey at Bologna, where they were married in the presence of his parents in a small church in <a href="Castenaso">Castenaso</a> a few miles from the city. The bride was thirty-seven, the groom thirty.

In Vienna, Rossini received a hero's welcome; his biographers describe it as "unprecedentedly feverish enthusiasm", "Rossini fever", and "near hysteria". The authoritarian chancellor of the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a>, <a href="Klemens%20von%20Metternich">Metternich</a>, liked Rossini's music, and thought it free of all potential revolutionary or republican associations. He was therefore happy to permit the San Carlo company to perform the composer's operas. In a three-month season they played six of them, to audiences so enthusiastic that <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>'s assistant, <a href="Anton%20Schindler">Anton Schindler</a>, described it as "an idolatrous orgy".

While in Vienna Rossini heard Beethoven's "<a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Beethoven%29">Eroica</a>" symphony, and was so moved that he determined to meet the reclusive composer. He finally managed to do so, and later described the encounter to many people, including <a href="Eduard%20Hanslick">Eduard Hanslick</a> and <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>. He recalled that although conversation was hampered by Beethoven's deafness and Rossini's ignorance of German, Beethoven made it plain that he thought Rossini's talents were not for serious opera, and that "above all" he should "do more "Barbiere"" "(Barbers)".

After the Vienna season Rossini returned to Castenaso to work with his librettist, <a href="Gaetano%20Rossi">Gaetano Rossi</a>, on "<a href="Semiramide">Semiramide</a>", commissioned by La Fenice. It was premiered in February 1823, his last work for the Italian theatre. Colbran starred, but it was clear to everyone that her voice was in serious decline, and "Semiramide" ended her career in Italy. The work survived that one major disadvantage, and entered the international operatic repertory, remaining popular throughout the 19th century; in Richard Osborne's words, it brought "[Rossini's] Italian career to a spectacular close."

In November 1823 Rossini and Colbran set off for London, where a lucrative contract had been offered. They stopped for four weeks "en route" in Paris. Although he was not as feverishly acclaimed by the Parisians as he had been in Vienna, he nevertheless had an exceptionally welcoming reception from the musical establishment and the public. When he attended a performance of "Il barbiere" at the Théâtre-Italien he was applauded, dragged onto the stage, and serenaded by the musicians. A banquet was given for him and his wife, attended by leading French composers and artists, and he found the cultural climate of Paris congenial.

Once in England, Rossini was received and made much of by the king, <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George IV</a>, although the composer was by now unimpressed by royalty and aristocracy. Rossini and Colbran had signed contracts for an opera season at the in the <a href="Haymarket%2C%20London">Haymarket</a>. Her vocal shortcomings were a serious liability, and she reluctantly retired from performing. Public opinion was not improved by Rossini's failure to provide a new opera, as promised. The impresario, Vincenzo Benelli, defaulted on his contract with the composer, but this was not known to the London press and public, who blamed Rossini.

In a 2003 biography of the composer, <a href="Gaia%20Servadio">Gaia Servadio</a> comments that Rossini and England were not made for each other. He was prostrated by the <a href="English%20Channel">Channel</a> crossing, and was unlikely to be enthused by the English weather or English cooking. Although his stay in London was financially rewarding – the British press reported disapprovingly that he had earned over £30,000 – he was happy to sign a contract at the French embassy in London to return to Paris, where he had felt much more at home.

Rossini's new, and highly remunerative, contract with the French government was negotiated under <a href="Louis%20XVIII%20of%20France">Louis XVIII</a>, who died in September 1824, soon after Rossini's arrival in Paris. It had been agreed that the composer would produce one <a href="grand%20opera">grand opera</a> for the Académie Royale de Musique and either an "opera buffa" or an "opera semiseria" for the Théâtre-Italien. He was also to help run the latter theatre and revise one of his earlier works for revival there. The death of the king and the succession of <a href="Charles%20X%20of%20France">Charles X</a> changed Rossini's plans, and his first new work for Paris was "<a href="Il%20viaggio%20a%20Reims">Il viaggio a Reims</a>", an operatic entertainment given in June 1825 to celebrate Charles's coronation. It was Rossini's last opera with an Italian libretto. He permitted only four performances of the piece, intending to reuse the best of the music in a less ephemeral opera. About half the score of "<a href="Le%20comte%20Ory">Le comte Ory</a>" (1828) is from the earlier work.

Colbran's enforced retirement put a strain on the Rossinis' marriage, leaving her unoccupied while he continued to be the centre of musical attention and constantly in demand. She consoled herself with what Servadio describes as "a new pleasure in shopping"; for Rossini, Paris offered continual gourmet delights, as his increasingly rotund shape began to reflect.

The first of the four operas Rossini wrote to French librettos were "<a href="Le%20si%C3%A8ge%20de%20Corinthe">Le siège de Corinthe</a>" (1826) and "<a href="Mos%C3%A8%20in%20Egitto">Moïse et Pharaon</a>" (1827). Both were substantial reworkings of pieces written for Naples: "<a href="Maometto%20II">Maometto II</a>" and "Mosè in Egitto". Rossini took great care before beginning work on the first, learning to speak French and familiarising himself with traditional French operatic ways of declaiming the language. As well as dropping some of the original music that was in an ornate style unfashionable in Paris, Rossini accommodated local preferences by adding dances, hymn-like numbers and a greater role for the chorus.

Rossini's mother, Anna, died in 1827; he had been devoted to her, and he felt her loss deeply. She and Colbran had never got on well, and Servadio suggests that after Anna died Rossini came to resent the surviving woman in his life.

In 1828 Rossini wrote "Le comte Ory", his only French-language comic opera. His determination to reuse music from "Il viaggio a Reims" caused problems for his librettists, who had to adapt their original plot and write French words to fit existing Italian numbers, but the opera was a success, and was seen in London within six months of the Paris premiere, and in New York in 1831. The following year Rossini wrote his long-awaited French grand opera, "<a href="William%20Tell%20%28opera%29">Guillaume Tell</a>", based on <a href="Friedrich%20Schiller">Friedrich Schiller</a>'s 1804 <a href="William%20Tell%20%28play%29">1804 play</a> which drew on the <a href="William%20Tell">William Tell</a> legend.

"Guillaume Tell" was well received. The orchestra and singers gathered outside Rossini's house after the premiere and performed the rousing finale to the second act in his honour. The newspaper "<a href="Le%20Globe">Le Globe</a>" commented that a new era of music had begun. <a href="Gaetano%20Donizetti">Gaetano Donizetti</a> remarked that the first and last acts of the opera were written by Rossini, but the middle act was written by God. The work was an undoubted success, without being a smash hit; the public took some time in getting to grips with it, and some singers found it too demanding. It nonetheless was produced abroad within months of the premiere, and there was no suspicion that it would be the composer's last opera.
Jointly with "Semiramide", "Guillaume Tell" is Rossini's longest opera, at three hours and forty-five minutes, and the effort of composing it left him exhausted. Although within a year he was planning an operatic treatment of the <a href="Faust">Faust</a> story, events and ill health overtook him. After the opening of "Guillaume Tell" the Rossinis had left Paris and were staying in Castenaso. Within a year events in Paris had Rossini hurrying back. Charles X was overthrown in <a href="July%20Revolution">a revolution in July</a> 1830, and the new administration, headed by <a href="Louis%20Philippe%20I">Louis Philippe I</a>, announced radical cutbacks in government spending. Among the cuts was Rossini's lifetime annuity, won after hard negotiation with the previous regime. Attempting to restore the annuity was one of Rossini's reasons for returning. The other was to be with his new mistress, <a href="Olympe%20P%C3%A9lissier">Olympe Pélissier</a>. He left Colbran in Castenaso; she never returned to Paris and they never lived together again.

The reasons for Rossini's withdrawal from opera have been continually discussed during and since his lifetime. Some have supposed that aged thirty-seven and in variable health, having negotiated a sizeable annuity from the French government, and having written thirty-nine operas, he simply planned to retire and kept to that plan. In a 1934 study of the composer, the critic <a href="Francis%20Toye">Francis Toye</a> coined the phrase "The Great Renunciation", and called Rossini's retirement a "phenomenon unique in the history of music and difficult to parallel in the whole history of art":

The poet <a href="Heinrich%20Heine">Heine</a> compared Rossini's retirement with <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s withdrawal from writing: two geniuses recognising when they had accomplished the unsurpassable and not seeking to follow it. Others, then and later, suggested that Rossini had retired because of pique at the successes of <a href="Giacomo%20Meyerbeer">Giacomo Meyerbeer</a> and <a href="Fromental%20Hal%C3%A9vy">Fromental Halévy</a> in the genre of grand opéra. Modern Rossini scholarship has generally discounted such theories, maintaining that Rossini had no intention of renouncing operatic composition, and that circumstances rather than personal choice made "Guillaume Tell" his last opera. Gossett and Richard Osborne suggest that illness may have been a major factor in Rossini's retirement. From about this time, Rossini had intermittent bad health, both physical and mental. He had contracted <a href="gonorrhoea">gonorrhoea</a> in earlier years, which later led to painful side-effects, from <a href="urethritis">urethritis</a> to <a href="arthritis">arthritis</a>; he suffered from bouts of debilitating depression, which commentators have linked to several possible causes: <a href="cyclothymia">cyclothymia</a>, or <a href="bipolar%20disorder">bipolar disorder</a>, or reaction to his mother's death.

For the next twenty-five years following "Guillaume Tell" Rossini composed little, although Gossett comments that his comparatively few compositions from the 1830s and 1840s show no falling-off in musical inspiration. They include the "Soirées musicales" (1830–1835: a set of twelve songs for solo or duet voices and piano) and his <a href="Stabat%20Mater%20%28Rossini%29">Stabat Mater</a> (begun in 1831 and completed in 1841). After winning his fight with the government over his annuity in 1835 Rossini left Paris and settled in Bologna. His return to Paris in 1843 for medical treatment by <a href="Jean%20Civiale">Jean Civiale</a> sparked hopes that he might produce a new grand opera – it was rumoured that <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Scribe">Eugène Scribe</a> was preparing a libretto for him about <a href="Joan%20of%20Arc">Joan of Arc</a>. The Opéra was moved to present a French version of "Otello" in 1844 which also included material from some of the composer's earlier operas. It is unclear to what extent – if at all – Rossini was involved with this production, which was in the event poorly received. More controversial was the "<a href="pasticcio">pasticcio</a>" opera of "<a href="Robert%20Bruce%20%28opera%29">Robert Bruce</a>" (1846), in which Rossini, by then returned to Bologna, closely cooperated by selecting music from his past operas which had not yet been performed in Paris, notably "La donna del lago." The Opéra sought to present "Robert" as a new Rossini opera. But although "Othello" could at least claim to be genuine, canonic, Rossini, the historian <a href="Mark%20Everist">Mark Everist</a> notes that detractors argued that "Robert" was simply "fake goods, and from a bygone era at that"; he cites <a href="Th%C3%A9ophile%20Gautier">Théophile Gautier</a> regretting that "the lack of unity could have been masked by a superior performance; unfortunately the tradition of Rossini's music was lost at the Opéra a long time ago."

The period after 1835 saw Rossini's formal separation from his wife, who remained at Castenaso (1837), and the death of his father at the age of eighty (1839). In 1845 Colbran became seriously ill, and in September Rossini travelled to visit her; a month later she died. The following year Rossini and Pélissier were married in Bologna. The events of the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848">Year of Revolution</a> in 1848 led Rossini to move away from the Bologna area, where he felt threatened by insurrection, and to make <a href="Florence">Florence</a> his base, which it remained until 1855.

By the early 1850s Rossini's mental and physical health had deteriorated to the point where his wife and friends feared for his sanity or his life. By the middle of the decade it was clear that he needed to return to Paris for the most advanced medical care then available. In April 1855 the Rossinis set off for their final journey from Italy to France. Rossini returned to Paris aged sixty-three and made it his home for the rest of his life.

Gossett observes that although an account of Rossini's life between 1830 and 1855 makes depressing reading, it is "no exaggeration to say that, in Paris, Rossini returned to life". He recovered his health and "<a href="joie%20de%20vivre">joie de vivre</a>". Once settled in Paris he maintained two homes: a flat in the <a href="rue%20de%20la%20Chauss%C3%A9e-d%27Antin">rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin</a>, a smart central area, and a neo-classical villa built for him in <a href="Passy">Passy</a>, a <a href="commune">commune</a> now absorbed into the city, but then semi-rural. He and his wife established a <a href="Salon%20%28gathering%29">salon</a> that became internationally famous. The first of their Saturday evening gatherings – the "samedi soirs" – was held in December 1858, and the last, two months before he died in 1868.

Rossini began composing again. His music from his final decade was not generally intended for public performance, and he did not usually put dates of composition on the manuscripts. Consequently, musicologists have found it difficult to give definite dates for his late works, but the first, or among the first, was the song cycle "Musique anodine", dedicated to his wife and presented to her in April 1857. For their weekly salons he produced more than 150 pieces, including songs, solo piano pieces, and chamber works for many different combinations of instruments. He referred to them as his "<a href="P%C3%A9ch%C3%A9s%20de%20vieillesse">Péchés de vieillesse</a>" – "sins of old age". The salons were held both at Beau Séjour – the Passy villa – and, in the winter, at the Paris flat. Such gatherings were a regular feature of Parisian life – the writer James Penrose has observed that the well-connected could easily attend different salons almost every night of the week – but the Rossinis' "samedi soirs" quickly became the most sought after: "an invitation was the city's highest social prize." The music, carefully chosen by Rossini, was not only his own, but included works by <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Pergolesi">Pergolesi</a>, Haydn and Mozart and modern pieces by some of his guests. Among the composers who attended the salons, and sometimes performed, were <a href="Daniel%20Auber">Auber</a>, <a href="Charles%20Gounod">Gounod</a>, <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Liszt</a>, <a href="Anton%20Rubinstein">Rubinstein</a>, Meyerbeer and <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi</a>. Rossini liked to call himself a fourth-class pianist, but the many famous pianists who attended the "samedi soirs" were dazzled by his playing. Violinists such as <a href="Pablo%20Sarasate">Pablo Sarasate</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Joachim">Joseph Joachim</a>, and the leading singers of the day were regular guests. In 1860, Wagner visited Rossini via an introduction from Rossini's friend <a href="Edmond%20Michotte%20collection%23Biography">Edmond Michotte</a> who some forty-five years later wrote his account of the genial conversation between the two composers.

One of Rossini's few late works intended to be given in public was his "<a href="Petite%20messe%20solennelle">Petite messe solennelle</a>", first performed in 1864. In the same year Rossini was made a grand officer of the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a> by Napoleon III.

After a short illness, and an unsuccessful operation to treat <a href="colorectal%20cancer">colorectal cancer</a>, Rossini died at Passy on 13 November 1868 at the age of seventy-six. He left Olympe a life interest in his estate, which after her death, ten years later, passed to the Commune of Pesaro for the establishment of a Liceo Musicale, and funded a home for retired opera singers in Paris. After a funeral service attended by more than four thousand people at the church of <a href="Sainte-Trinit%C3%A9%2C%20Paris">Sainte-Trinité</a>, Paris, Rossini's body was interred at the <a href="P%C3%A8re%20Lachaise%20Cemetery">Père Lachaise Cemetery</a>. In 1887 his remains were moved to the church of <a href="Santa%20Croce%2C%20Florence">Santa Croce</a>, Florence.

The writer <a href="Julian%20Budden">Julian Budden</a>, noting the formulas adopted early on by Rossini in his career and consistently followed by him thereafter as regards overtures, <a href="aria">aria</a>s, structures and ensembles, has called them "the Code Rossini" in a reference to the <a href="Code%20Napol%C3%A9on">Code Napoléon</a>, the legal system established by the French Emperor. Rossini's overall style may indeed have been influenced more directly by the French: the historian John Rosselli suggests that French rule in Italy at the start of the 19th century meant that "music had taken on new military qualities of attack, noise and speed – to be heard in Rossini." Rossini's approach to opera was inevitably tempered by changing tastes and audience demands. The formal "classicist" libretti of <a href="Metastasio">Metastasio</a> which had underpinned late 18th century "<a href="opera%20seria">opera seria</a>" were replaced by subjects more to the taste of the age of <a href="Romanticism">Romanticism</a>, with stories demanding stronger characterisation and quicker action; a jobbing composer needed to meet these demands or fail. Rossini's strategies met this reality. A formulaic approach was logistically indispensable for Rossini's career, at least at the start: in the seven years 1812–1819, he wrote 27 operas, often at extremely short notice. For "<a href="La%20Cenerentola">La Cenerentola</a>" (1817), for example, he had just over three weeks to write the music before the première.

Such pressures led to a further significant element of Rossini's compositional procedures, not included in Budden's "Code", namely, recycling. The composer often transferred a successful overture to subsequent operas: thus the overture to "<a href="La%20pietra%20del%20paragone">La pietra del paragone</a>" was later used for the "opera seria" "<a href="Tancredi">Tancredi</a>" (1813), and (in the other direction) the overture to "<a href="Aureliano%20in%20Palmira">Aureliano in Palmira</a>" (1813) ended as (and is today known as) the overture to the comedy "<a href="The%20Barber%20of%20Seville">Il barbiere di Siviglia</a> (The Barber of Seville)". He also liberally re-employed arias and other sequences in later works. <a href="Spike%20Hughes">Spike Hughes</a> notes that of the twenty-six numbers of "<a href="Eduardo%20e%20Cristina">Eduardo e Cristina</a>", produced in Venice in 1817, nineteen were lifted from previous works. "The audience ... were remarkably good-humoured  ... and asked slyly why the libretto had been changed since the last performance". Rossini expressed his disgust when the publisher <a href="Giovanni%20Ricordi">Giovanni Ricordi</a> issued a complete edition of his works in the 1850s: "The same pieces will be found several times, for I thought I had the right to remove from my fiascos those pieces which seemed best, to rescue them from shipwreck ... A fiasco seemed to be good and dead, and now look they've resuscitated them all!"

Gossett notes that Rossini "was from the outset a consummate composer of <a href="overture">overture</a>s." His basic formula for these remained constant throughout his career: Gossett characterises them as "<a href="sonata%20form">sonata</a> movements without <a href="Development%20section">development</a> sections, usually preceded by a slow introduction" with "clear melodies, exuberant rhythms [and] simple harmonic structure" and a "<a href="crescendo">crescendo</a>" climax. <a href="Richard%20Taruskin">Richard Taruskin</a> also notes that the second theme is always announced in a <a href="woodwind">woodwind</a> solo, whose "catchiness" "etch[es] a distinct profile in the aural memory", and that the richness and inventiveness of his handling of the orchestra, even in these early works, marks the start of "[t]he great nineteenth-century flowering of <a href="orchestration">orchestration</a>."

Rossini's handling of arias (and duets) in "<a href="cavatina">cavatina</a>" style marked a development from the eighteenth-century commonplace of <a href="recitative">recitative</a> and aria. In the words of Rosselli, in Rossini's hands "the aria became an engine for releasing emotion". Rossini's typical aria structure involved a lyrical introduction (""cantabile"") and a more intensive, brilliant, conclusion (""cabaletta""). This model could be adapted in various ways so as to forward the plot (as opposed to the typical eighteenth-century handling which resulted in the action coming to a halt as the requisite repeats of the "<a href="da%20capo%20aria">da capo aria</a>" were undertaken). For example, they could be punctuated by comments from other characters (a convention known as ""pertichini""), or the chorus could intervene between the "cantabile" and the "cabaletta" so as to fire up the soloist. If such developments were not necessarily Rossini's own invention, he nevertheless made them his own by his expert handling of them. A landmark in this context is the "cavatina" ""Di tanti palpiti"" from "Tancredi", which both Taruskin and Gossett (amongst others) single out as transformative, "the most famous aria Rossini ever wrote", with a "melody that seems to capture the melodic beauty and innocence characteristic of Italian opera." Both writers point out the typical Rossinian touch of avoiding an "expected" cadence in the aria by a sudden shift from the home key of F to that of A flat (see example); Taruskin notes the implicit pun, as the words talk of returning, but the music moves in a new direction. The influence was lasting; Gossett notes how the Rossinian "cabaletta" style continued to inform Italian opera as late as <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Giuseppe Verdi</a>'s "<a href="Aida">Aida</a>" (1871).

Such structural integration of the forms of vocal music with the dramatic development of the opera meant a sea-change from the Mestastasian primacy of the aria; in Rossini's works, solo arias progressively take up a smaller proportion of the operas, in favour of duets (also typically in "cantabile-caballetta" format) and ensembles.

During the late 18th-century, creators of "opera buffa" had increasingly developed dramatic integration of the finales of each act. Finales began to "spread backwards", taking an ever larger proportion of the act, taking the structure of a musically continuous chain, accompanied throughout by orchestra, of a series of sections, each with its own characteristics of speed and style, mounting to a clamorous and vigorous final scene. In his comic operas Rossini brought this technique to its peak, and extended its range far beyond his predecessors. Of the finale to the first act of "<a href="L%27italiana%20in%20Algeri">L'italiana in Algeri</a>", Taruskin writes that "[r]unning through almost a hundred pages of vocal score in record time, it is the most concentrated single dose of Rossini that there is."

Of greater consequence for the history of opera was Rossini's ability to progress this technique in the genre of "opera seria". Gossett in a very detailed analysis of the first-act finale of "Tancredi" identifies several the elements in Rossini's practice. These include the contrast of "kinetic" action sequences, often characterised by orchestral motifs, with "static" expressions of emotion, the final "static" section in the form of a caballetta, with all the characters joining in the final cadences. Gossett claims that it is "from the time of "Tancredi" that the caballetta ... becomes the obligatory closing section of each musical unit in the operas of Rossini and his contemporaries."

With extremely few exceptions, all Rossini's compositions before the "<a href="P%C3%A9ch%C3%A9s%20de%20vieillesse">Péchés de vieillesse</a>" of his retirement involve the human voice. His very first surviving work (apart from a single song) is however a set of string sonatas for two violins, cello and double-bass, written at the age of 12, when he had barely begun instruction in composition. Tuneful and engaging, they indicate how remote the talented child was from the influence of the advances in musical form evolved by Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven; the accent is on <a href="cantabile">cantabile</a> melody, colour, variation and virtuosity rather than <a href="musical%20development">transformational development</a>. These qualities are also evident in Rossini's early operas, especially his "farse" (one-act farces), rather than his more formal "<a href="opera%20seria">opere serie</a>". <a href="Philip%20Gossett">Philip Gossett</a> notes that these early works were written at a time when "[t]he deposited mantles of <a href="Domenico%20Cimarosa">Cimarosa</a> and <a href="Giovanni%20Paisiello">Paisiello</a> were unfilled" – these were Rossini's first, and increasingly appreciated, steps in trying them on. The <a href="Teatro%20San%20Mois%C3%A8">Teatro San Moisè</a> in Venice, where his "farse" were first performed, and the <a href="La%20Scala">La Scala</a> Theatre of Milan which premiered his two-act opera "La pietra del paragone" (1812), were seeking works in that tradition; Gossett notes that in these operas "Rossini's musical personality began to take shape ... many elements emerge that remain throughout his career" including "[a] love of sheer sound, of sharp and effective rhythms". The unusual effect employed in the overture of "<a href="Il%20signor%20Bruschino">Il signor Bruschino</a>", (1813) deploying violin <a href="bow%20%28music%29">bows</a> tapping rhythms on <a href="music%20stand">music stand</a>s, is an example of such witty originality.

The great success in Venice of the premieres of both "Tancredi" and the comic opera "L'italiana in Algeri" within a few weeks of each other (6 February 1813 and 22 May 1813 respectively) set the seal on Rossini's reputation as the rising opera composer of his generation. From the end of 1813 to mid-1814 he was in Milan creating two new operas for La Scala, "Aureliano in Palmira" and "<a href="Il%20Turco%20in%20Italia">Il Turco in Italia</a>". Arsace in "Aureliano" was sung by the "<a href="castrato">castrato</a>" <a href="Giovanni%20Velluti%20%28castrato%29">Giambattista Velluti</a>; this was the last opera role Rossini wrote for a "castrato" singer as the norm became to use <a href="contralto">contralto</a> voices – another sign of change in operatic taste. Rumour had it that Rossini was displeased by Velluti's <a href="ornamentation%20%28music%29">ornamentation</a> of his music; but in fact throughout his Italian period, up to "<a href="Semiramide">Semiramide</a>" (1823), Rossini's written vocal lines become increasingly florid, and this is more appropriately credited to the composer's own changing style.

Rossini's work in Naples contributed to this stylistic development. The city, which was the cradle of the operas of Cimarosa and Paisiello, had been slow to acknowledge the composer from Pesaro, but <a href="Domenico%20Barbaja">Domenico Barbaja</a> invited him in 1815 on a seven-year contract to manage his theatres and compose operas. For the first time, Rossini was able to work over a long period with a company of musicians and singers, including amongst the latter <a href="Isabella%20Colbran">Isabella Colbran</a>, <a href="Andrea%20Nozzari">Andrea Nozzari</a>, <a href="Giovanni%20David">Giovanni David</a> and others, who as Gossett notes "all specialized in florid singing" and "whose vocal talents left an indelible and not wholly positive mark on Rossini's style". Rossini's first operas for Naples, "<a href="Elisabetta%2C%20regina%20d%27Inghilterra">Elisabetta, regina d'Inghilterra</a>" and "<a href="La%20gazzetta">La gazzetta</a>" were both largely recycled from earlier works, but "<a href="Otello%20%28Rossini%29">Otello</a>" (1816) is marked not only by its virtuoso vocal lines but by its masterfully integrated last act, with its drama underlined by melody, orchestration and tonal colour; here, in Gossett's opinion "Rossini came of age as a dramatic artist." He further comments: 
By now, Rossini's career was arousing interest across Europe. Others came to Italy to study the revival of Italian opera and used its lessons to advance themselves; amongst these was the Berlin-born <a href="Giacomo%20Meyerbeer">Giacomo Meyerbeer</a> who arrived in Italy in 1816, a year after Rossini's establishment at Naples, and lived and worked there until following him to Paris in 1825; he used one of Rossini's librettists, <a href="Gaetano%20Rossi">Gaetano Rossi</a>, for five of his seven Italian operas, which were produced at Turin, Venice and Milan. In a letter to his brother of September 1818, he includes a detailed critique of "Otello" from the point of view of a non-Italian informed observer. He is scathing about the self-borrowings in the first two acts, but concedes that the third act "so firmly established Rossini's reputation in Venice that even a thousand follies could not rob him of it. But this act is divinely beautiful, and what is so strange is that [its] beauties ... are blatantly un-Rossinian: outstanding, even passionate recitatives, mysterious accompaniments, lots of local colour."

Rossini's contract did not prevent him from undertaking other commissions, and before "Otello, Il barbiere di Siviglia", a grand culmination of the "opera buffa" tradition, had been premiered in Rome (February 1816). Richard Osborne catalogues its excellencies:Beyond the physical impact of ... Figaro's ""<a href="Largo%20al%20factotum">Largo al factotum</a>"", there is Rossini's ear for vocal and instrumental timbres of a peculiar astringency and brilliance, his quick-witted word-setting, and his mastery of large musical forms with their often brilliant and explosive internal variations. Add to that what Verdi called the opera's "abundance of true musical ideas", and the reasons for the work's longer-term emergence as Rossini's most popular "opera buffa" are not hard to find.

Apart from "La Cenerentola" (Rome, 1817), and the "pen-and-ink sketch" "<a href="farsa">farsa</a>" "<a href="Adina%20%28opera%29">Adina</a>" (1818, not performed until 1826), Rossini's other works during his contract with Naples were all in the "opera seria" tradition. Amongst the most notable of these, all containing virtuoso singing roles, were "<a href="Mos%C3%A8%20in%20Egitto">Mosè in Egitto</a>" (1818), "<a href="La%20donna%20del%20lago">La donna del lago</a>" (1819), "<a href="Maometto%20II">Maometto II</a>" (1820) all staged in Naples, and "Semiramide", his last opera written for Italy, staged at <a href="La%20Fenice">La Fenice</a> in Venice in 1823. Both "Mosè" and "Maometto II" were later to undergo significant reconstruction in Paris (see below).

 Already in 1818, Meyerbeer had heard rumours that Rossini was seeking a lucrative appointment at the <a href="Paris%20Op%C3%A9ra">Paris Opéra</a> – "Should [his proposals] be accepted, he will go to the French capital, and we will perhaps experience curious things." Some six years were to pass before this prophecy came true.

In 1824 Rossini, under a contract with the French government, became director of the <a href="Com%C3%A9die-Italienne">Théâtre-Italien</a> in Paris, where he introduced Meyerbeer's opera "<a href="Il%20crociato%20in%20Egitto">Il crociato in Egitto</a>", and for which he wrote "<a href="Il%20viaggio%20a%20Reims">Il viaggio a Reims</a>" to celebrate the coronation of <a href="Charles%20X%20of%20France">Charles X</a> (1825). This was his last opera to an Italian libretto, and was later cannibalised to create his first French opera, "<a href="Le%20comte%20Ory">Le comte Ory</a>" (1828). A new contract in 1826 meant he could concentrate on productions at the Opéra and to this end he substantially revised "Maometta II" as "<a href="Le%20si%C3%A8ge%20de%20Corinthe">Le siège de Corinthe</a>" (1826) and "Mosé" as "<a href="Mo%C3%AFse%20et%20Pharaon">Moïse et Pharaon</a>" (1827). Meeting French taste, the works are extended (each by one act), the vocal lines in the revisions are less florid and the dramatic structure is enhanced, with the proportion of arias reduced. One of the most striking additions was the chorus at the end of Act III of "Moïse", with a <a href="crescendo">crescendo</a> repetition of a <a href="diatonic">diatonic</a> ascending bass line, rising first by a <a href="minor%20third">minor third</a>, then by a <a href="major%20third">major third</a>, at each appearance, and a descending <a href="chromatic">chromatic</a> top line, which roused the excitement of audiences.

Rossini's government contract required him to create at least one new ""grand opėra"", and Rossini settled on the story of <a href="William%20Tell">William Tell</a>, working closely with the librettist <a href="%C3%89tienne%20de%20Jouy">Étienne de Jouy</a>. The story in particular enabled him to indulge "an underlying interest in the related genres of folk music, pastoral and the picturesque". This becomes clear from the overture, which is explicitly programmatic in describing weather, scenery and action, and presents a version of the "<a href="ranz%20des%20vaches">ranz des vaches</a>", the Swiss cowherd's call, which "undergoes a number of transformations during the opera" and gives it in Richard Osborne's opinion "something of the character of a <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a>". In the opinion of the music historian Benjamin Walton, Rossini "saturate[s] the work with local colour to such a degree that there is room for little else." Thus, the role of the soloists is significantly reduced compared to other Rossini operas, the hero not even having an aria of his own, whilst the chorus of the Swiss people is consistently in the musical and dramatic foregrounds.

"<a href="Guillaume%20Tell">Guillaume Tell</a>" premiered in August 1829. Rossini also provided for the Opéra a shorter, three-act version, which incorporated the "pas redoublé" (quick march) final section of the overture in its finale; it was first performed in 1831 and became the basis of the Opéra's future productions. "Tell" was very successful from the start and was frequently revived – in 1868 the composer was present at its 500th performance at the Opéra. The "Globe" had reported enthusiastically at its opening that "a new epoch has opened not only for French opera, but for dramatic music elsewhere." This was an era, it transpired, in which Rossini was not to participate.

Rossini's contract required him to provide five new works for the Opéra over 10 years. After the première of "Tell" he was already considering some opera subjects, including <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Goethe</a>'s "<a href="Goethe%27s%20Faust">Faust</a>", but the only significant works he completed before abandoning Paris in 1836 were the <a href="Stabat%20Mater%20%28Rossini%29">Stabat Mater</a>, written for a private commission in 1831 (later completed and published in 1841), and the collection of salon vocal music "Soirées musicales" published in 1835. Living in Bologna, he occupied himself teaching singing at the Liceo Musicale, and also created a "<a href="pasticcio">pasticcio</a>" of "Tell", "Rodolfo di Sterlinga", for the benefit of the singer Nikolay Ivanov, for which <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Giuseppe Verdi</a> provided some new arias. Continuing demand in Paris resulted in the productions of a "new" French version of "Otello" in 1844 (with which Rossini was not involved) and a "new" opera "<a href="Robert%20Bruce%20%28opera%29">Robert Bruce</a>" for which Rossini cooperated with <a href="Louis%20Niedermeyer">Louis Niedermeyer</a> and others to recast music for "La donna del lago" and others of his works which were little-known in Paris to fit a new libretto. The success of both of these was qualified, to say the least.

Not until Rossini returned to Paris in 1855 were there signs of a revival of his musical spirits. A stream of pieces, for voices, choir, piano, and chamber ensembles, written for his soirées, the "<a href="P%C3%A9ch%C3%A9s%20de%20vieillesse">Péchés de vieillesse</a> (Sins of old age)" were issued in thirteen volumes from 1857 to 1868; of these volumes 4 to 8 comprise "56 semi-comical piano pieces ... dedicated to pianists of the fourth class, to which I have the honour of belonging." These include a mock <a href="funeral%20march">funeral march</a>, "Marche et reminiscences pour mon dernier voyage (March and reminiscences for my last journey)." Gossett writes of the "Péchés" "Their historical position remains to be assessed but it seems likely that their effect, direct or indirect, on composers like <a href="Camille%20Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Camille Saint-Saëns</a> and <a href="Erik%20Satie">Erik Satie</a> was significant."

The most substantial work of Rossini's last decade, the "<a href="Petite%20messe%20solennelle">Petite messe solennelle</a>" (1863), was written for small forces (originally voices, two pianos and <a href="harmonium">harmonium</a>), and therefore unsuited to concert hall performance; and as it included women's voices it was unacceptable for church performances at the time. For these reasons, Richard Osborne suggests, the piece has been somewhat overlooked among Rossini's compositions. It is neither especially "petite" (little) nor entirely "solennelle" (solemn), but is notable for its grace, counterpoint and melody. At the end of the manuscript, the composer wrote Dear God, here it is finished, this poor little Mass. Is it sacred music I have written, or damned music? I was born for opera buffa, as you know well. A little technique, a little heart, that's all. Be blessed then, and grant me Paradise.

The popularity of Rossini's melodies led many contemporary virtuosi to create piano transcriptions or fantasies based on them. Examples include <a href="Sigismond%20Thalberg">Sigismond Thalberg</a>'s fantasy on themes from "Moïse", the sets of variations on "Non più mesta" from "La Cenerentola" by <a href="Henri%20Herz">Henri Herz</a>, <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Frédéric Chopin</a>, <a href="Franz%20H%C3%BCnten">Franz Hünten</a>, <a href="Anton%20Diabelli">Anton Diabelli</a> and <a href="Friedrich%20Burgm%C3%BCller">Friedrich Burgmüller</a>, and Liszt's transcriptions of the "William Tell" overture (1838) and the "Soirées musicales".

The continuing popularity of his comic operas (and the decline in staging his "opere serie"), the overthrow of the singing and staging styles of his period, and the emerging concept of the composer as "creative artist" rather than craftsman, diminished and distorted Rossini's place in music history even though the forms of Italian opera continued up to the period of <a href="verismo">verismo</a> to be indebted to his innovations. Rossini's status amongst his contemporary Italian composers is indicated by the "<a href="Messa%20per%20Rossini">Messa per Rossini</a>", a project initiated by Verdi within a few days of Rossini's death, which he and a dozen other composers created in collaboration.

If Rossini's principal legacy to Italian opera was in vocal forms and dramatic structure for serious opera, his legacy to French opera was to provide a bridge from opera buffa to the development of "<a href="op%C3%A9ra%20comique">opéra comique</a>" (and thence, via <a href="Jacques%20Offenbach">Jacques Offenbach</a>'s "<a href="op%C3%A9ra%20bouffe">opéras bouffes</a>" to the genre of <a href="operetta">operetta</a>). "Opéras comiques" showing a debt to Rossini's style include <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Adrien%20Boieldieu">François-Adrien Boieldieu</a>'s "<a href="La%20dame%20blanche">La dame blanche</a>" (1825) and <a href="Daniel%20Auber">Daniel Auber</a>'s "<a href="Fra%20Diavolo">Fra Diavolo</a>" (1830), as well as works by <a href="Ferdinand%20H%C3%A9rold">Ferdinand Hérold</a>, <a href="Adolphe%20Adam">Adolphe Adam</a> and <a href="Fromental%20Hal%C3%A9vy">Fromental Halévy</a>. Critical of Rossini's style was <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Hector Berlioz</a>, who wrote of his "melodic cynicism, his contempt for dramatic and good sense, his endless repetition of a single form of cadence, his eternal puerile crescendo and his brutal bass drum". 

It was perhaps inevitable that the formidable reputation which Rossini had built in his lifetime would fade thereafter. In 1886, less than twenty years after the composer's death, <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">Bernard Shaw</a> wrote: "The once universal Rossini, whose "Semiramide" appeared to our greener grandfathers a <a href="Nineveh">Ninevesque</a> wonder, came at last to be no longer looked upon as a serious musician." In an 1877 review of "Il barbiere", he noted that <a href="Adelina%20Patti">Adelina Patti</a> sang as an encore in the lesson scene "<a href="Home%21%20Sweet%20Home%21">Home, Sweet Home</a>" but that "the opera proved so intolerably wearisome that some of her audience had already displayed their appreciation of the sentiment of the ballad in the most practical way."

In the early 20th century Rossini received tributes from both <a href="Ottorino%20Respighi">Ottorino Respighi</a>, who had orchestrated excerpts from the "Péchés de viellesse" both in his ballet "<a href="la%20boutique%20fantasque">la boutique fantasque</a>" (1918) and in his 1925 suite "<a href="Rossiniana">Rossiniana</a>", and from <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a>, who adapted music by Rossini for two suites, "Soirées musicales" (Op. 9) in 1936 and "<a href="Matin%C3%A9es%20musicales">Matinées musicales</a>" (Op. 24) in 1941. Richard Osborne singles out the three-volume biography of Rossini by Giuseppe Radiciotti (1927–1929) as an important turning-point towards positive appreciation, which may also have been assisted by the trend of <a href="neoclassicism%20%28music%29">neoclassicism</a> in music. A firm re-evaluation of Rossini's significance began only later in the 20th century in the light of in the light of study, and the creation of critical editions, of his works. A prime mover in these developments was the "Fondazione G. Rossini" which was created by the city of Pesaro in 1940 using the funds which had been left to the city by the composer. Since 1980 the "Fondazione" has supported the annual <a href="Rossini%20Opera%20Festival">Rossini Opera Festival</a> in Pesaro.

In the 21st century, the Rossini repertoire of opera houses around the world remains dominated by "Il barbiere", "La Cenerentola" being the second most popular. Several other operas are regularly produced, including "Le comte Ory", "La donna del lago", "La gazza ladra", "Guillaume Tell", "L'italiana in Algeri", "La scala di seta", "Il turco in Italia" and "Il viaggio a Reims". Other Rossini pieces in the current international repertory, given from time to time, include "<a href="Adina%20%28opera%29">Adina</a>", "<a href="Armida">Armida</a>", "Elisabetta regina d'Inghilterra", "<a href="Ermione">Ermione</a>", "Mosé in Egitto" and "Tancredi". The <a href="Rossini%20in%20Wildbad">Rossini in Wildbad</a> festival specialises in producing the rarer works. The <a href="Operabase">Operabase</a> performance-listing website records 2,319 performances of 532 productions of Rossini operas in 255 venues across the world in the three years 2017–2019.

Grover Cleveland

Stephen Grover Cleveland (March 18, 1837 – June 24, 1908) was an American politician and lawyer who was the 22nd and 24th <a href="president%20of%20the%20United%20States">president of the United States</a>, the only president in American history to serve two non-consecutive terms in office (1885–1889 and 1893–1897). He won the <a href="Elections%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Presidential%20elections">popular vote</a> for three presidential elections—in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201884">1884</a>, <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201888">1888</a>, and <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201892">1892</a>—and was one of two <a href="History%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> (with <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>) to be elected president during the era of <a href="History%20of%20the%20Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> political domination dating from 1861 to 1933.

Cleveland was the leader of the pro-business <a href="Bourbon%20Democrats">Bourbon Democrats</a> who opposed <a href="Tariffs%20in%20United%20States%20history%23Civil%20War%20protective%20policy%2C%201861%E2%80%931913">high tariffs</a>, <a href="Free%20Silver">Free Silver</a>, inflation, <a href="Overseas%20expansion%20of%20the%20United%20States%23Hawaii">imperialism</a>, and subsidies to business, farmers, or veterans. His crusade for political reform and <a href="fiscal%20conservatism">fiscal conservatism</a> made him an icon for American conservatives of the era. Cleveland won praise for his honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to the principles of <a href="classical%20liberalism">classical liberalism</a>. He fought political corruption, patronage, and <a href="Political%20boss">bossism</a>. As a reformer, Cleveland had such prestige that the like-minded wing of the Republican Party, called "<a href="Mugwump">Mugwump</a>s", largely bolted the GOP presidential ticket and swung to his support in the 1884 election.

As his second administration began, disaster hit the nation when the <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a> produced a severe national depression, which Cleveland was unable to reverse. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening the way for a <a href="United%20States%20House%20elections%2C%201894">Republican landslide in 1894</a> and for the agrarian and <a href="silverite">silverite</a> seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a <a href="realigning%20election">political realignment</a> that ended the <a href="Third%20Party%20System">Third Party System</a> and launched the <a href="Fourth%20Party%20System">Fourth Party System</a> and the <a href="Progressive%20Era">Progressive Era</a>.

Cleveland was a formidable policymaker, and he also drew corresponding criticism. His intervention in the <a href="Pullman%20Strike">Pullman Strike</a> of 1894 to keep the railroads moving angered labor unions nationwide in addition to the party in Illinois; his support of the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a> and opposition to Free Silver alienated the <a href="Agrarianism">agrarian</a> wing of the Democratic Party. Critics complained that Cleveland had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters—<a href="Depression%20%28economics%29">depressions</a> and strikes—in his second term. Even so, his reputation for probity and good character survived the troubles of his second term. Biographer <a href="Allan%20Nevins">Allan Nevins</a> wrote, "[I]n Grover Cleveland, the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities. He had no endowments that thousands of men do not have. He possessed honesty, courage, firmness, independence, and common sense. But he possessed them to a degree other men do not." By the end of his second term, public perception showed him to be one of the most unpopular U.S. presidents, and he was by then rejected even by most Democrats. Today, Cleveland is considered by most historians to have been a successful leader, generally <a href="Historical%20rankings%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">ranked among the upper-mid tier</a> of American presidents.

Stephen Grover Cleveland was born on March 18, 1837, in <a href="Caldwell%2C%20New%20Jersey">Caldwell, New Jersey</a>, to Ann (née Neal) and <a href="Richard%20Falley%20Cleveland">Richard Falley Cleveland</a>. Cleveland's father was a <a href="Congregationalism%20in%20the%20United%20States">Congregational</a> and <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> minister who was originally from <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>. His mother was from <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> and was the daughter of a bookseller. On his father's side, Cleveland was descended from English ancestors, the first of the family having emigrated to <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> from <a href="Cleveland%2C%20England">Cleveland</a>, England in 1635. His father's maternal grandfather, <a href="Richard%20Falley%20Jr.">Richard Falley Jr.</a>, fought at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bunker%20Hill">Battle of Bunker Hill</a>, and was the son of an immigrant from <a href="Guernsey">Guernsey</a>. On his mother's side, Cleveland was descended from <a href="Anglo-Irish">Anglo-Irish</a> Protestants and <a href="German%20Americans">German</a> <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a>s from Philadelphia. Cleveland was distantly related to General <a href="Moses%20Cleaveland">Moses Cleaveland</a>, after whom the city of <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland, Ohio</a>, was named.

Cleveland, the fifth of nine children, was named Stephen Grover in honor of the first pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Caldwell, where his father was pastor at the time. He became known as Grover in his adult life. In 1841, the Cleveland family moved to <a href="Fayetteville%2C%20New%20York">Fayetteville, New York</a>, where Grover spent much of his childhood. Neighbors later described him as "full of fun and inclined to play pranks," and fond of outdoor sports.

In 1850, Cleveland's father moved to <a href="Clinton%2C%20Oneida%20County%2C%20New%20York">Clinton, Oneida County, New York</a>, to work as district secretary for the <a href="American%20Home%20Missionary%20Society">American Home Missionary Society</a>. Despite his father's dedication to his missionary work, the income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school into a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned to Clinton and his schooling at the completion of the apprentice contract. In 1853, when missionary work began to take a toll on his health, Cleveland's father took an assignment in <a href="Holland%20Patent%2C%20New%20York">Holland Patent, New York</a> (near <a href="Utica%2C%20New%20York">Utica</a>) and the family moved again. Shortly after, he died from a <a href="gastric%20ulcer">gastric ulcer</a>, with Grover reputedly hearing of his father's death from a boy selling newspapers.

Cleveland received his elementary education at the Fayetteville Academy and the Clinton Liberal Academy. After his father died in 1853, he again left school to help support his family. Later that year, Cleveland's brother William was hired as a teacher at the <a href="New%20York%20Institute%20for%20the%20Blind">New York Institute for the Blind</a> in New York City, and William obtained a place for Cleveland as an assistant teacher. He returned home to Holland Patent at the end of 1854, where an elder in his church offered to pay for his college education if he would promise to become a minister. Cleveland declined, and in 1855 he decided to move west. He stopped first in <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo, New York</a>, where his uncle, <a href="Lewis%20F.%20Allen">Lewis F. Allen</a>, gave him a clerical job. Allen was an important man in Buffalo, and he introduced his nephew to influential men there, including the partners in the <a href="law%20firm">law firm</a> of Rogers, Bowen, and Rogers. <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a>, the 13th president of the United States, had previously worked for the partnership. Cleveland later took a clerkship with the firm, began to <a href="read%20the%20law">read the law</a>, and was <a href="Admission%20to%20practice%20law">admitted</a> to the New York bar in 1859.

Cleveland worked for the Rogers firm for three years, then left in 1862 to start his own practice. In January 1863, he was appointed assistant <a href="district%20attorney">district attorney</a> of <a href="Erie%20County%2C%20New%20York">Erie County</a>. With the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> raging, Congress passed the <a href="Conscription%20Act%20of%201863">Conscription Act of 1863</a>, requiring able-bodied men to serve in the army if called upon, or else to hire a substitute. Cleveland chose the latter course, paying $150 () to George Benninsky, a thirty-two-year-old <a href="Poles">Polish</a> immigrant, to serve in his place.

As a lawyer, Cleveland became known for his single-minded concentration and dedication to hard work. In 1866, he successfully defended some participants in the <a href="Fenian%20raids%23Niagara%20raid%20%281866%29">Fenian raid</a>, working on a "<a href="pro%20bono">pro bono</a>" basis (free of charge). In 1868, Cleveland attracted professional attention for his winning defense of a <a href="libel">libel</a> suit against the editor of Buffalo's "Commercial Advertiser". During this time, Cleveland assumed a lifestyle of simplicity, taking residence in a plain <a href="boarding%20house">boarding house</a>; Cleveland dedicated his growing income instead to the support of his mother and younger sisters. While his personal quarters were austere, Cleveland enjoyed an active social life and "the easy-going sociability of hotel-lobbies and <a href="Western%20saloon">saloons</a>." He shunned the circles of higher society of Buffalo in which his uncle's family traveled.

From his earliest involvement in politics, Cleveland aligned with the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a>. He had a decided aversion to Republicans <a href="John%20Fremont">John Fremont</a> and <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, and the heads of the Rogers law firm were solid Democrats. In 1865, he ran for <a href="District%20Attorney">District Attorney</a>, losing narrowly to his friend and roommate, <a href="Lyman%20K.%20Bass">Lyman K. Bass</a>, the Republican nominee. In 1870, with the help of friend Oscar Folsom, Cleveland secured the Democratic nomination for <a href="Sheriff%20of%20Erie%20County%2C%20New%20York">Sheriff of Erie County, New York</a>. He won the election by a 303-vote margin and took office on January 1, 1871 at age 33. While this new career took him away from the practice of law, it was rewarding in other ways: the fees were said to yield up to $40,000 () over the two-year term.

Cleveland's service as sheriff was unremarkable; biographer <a href="Rexford%20Tugwell">Rexford Tugwell</a> described the time in office as a waste for Cleveland politically. Cleveland was aware of graft in the sheriff's office during his tenure and chose not to confront it. A notable incident of his term took place on September 6, 1872, when Patrick Morrissey was executed, who had been convicted of murdering his mother. As sheriff, Cleveland was responsible for either personally carrying out the execution or paying a deputy $10 to perform the task. In spite of reservations about the hanging, Cleveland executed Morrissey himself; he hanged another murderer, <a href="List%20of%20individuals%20executed%20in%20New%20York">John Gaffney</a>, on February 14, 1873.

After his term as sheriff ended, Cleveland returned to his law practice, opening a firm with his friends Lyman K. Bass and <a href="Wilson%20S.%20Bissell">Wilson S. Bissell</a>. Elected to Congress in 1872, Bass did not spend much time at the firm, but Cleveland and Bissell soon rose to the top of Buffalo's legal community. Up to that point, Cleveland's political career had been honorable and unexceptional. As biographer <a href="Allan%20Nevins">Allan Nevins</a> wrote, "Probably no man in the country, on March 4, 1881, had less thought than this limited, simple, sturdy attorney of Buffalo that four years later he would be standing in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington</a> and taking the oath as President of the United States."

It was during this period that Cleveland began a relationship with a widow, <a href="Maria%20Crofts%20Halpin">Maria Crofts Halpin</a>. She accused him of raping her. He accused her of being an alcoholic and consorting with men. He had her institutionalized and her child taken away and raised by his friends. The illegitimate child became a campaign issue for the GOP in his first presidential campaign.

In the 1870s, the municipal government in Buffalo had grown increasingly corrupt, with Democratic and Republican <a href="political%20machine">political machine</a>s cooperating to share the <a href="Spoils%20system">spoils</a> of political office. In 1881 the Republicans nominated a slate of particularly disreputable machine politicians; the Democrats saw the opportunity to gain the votes of disaffected Republicans by nominating a more honest candidate. The party leaders approached Cleveland, and he agreed to run for <a href="List%20of%20mayors%20of%20Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Mayor of Buffalo</a>, provided that the rest of the ticket was to his liking. When the more notorious politicians were left off the Democratic ticket, Cleveland accepted the nomination. Cleveland was elected mayor with 15,120 votes, as against 11,528 for Milton C. Beebe, his opponent. He took office January 2, 1882.

Cleveland's term as mayor was spent fighting the entrenched interests of the party machines. Among the acts that established his reputation was a veto of the street-cleaning bill passed by the <a href="Buffalo%20Common%20Council">Common Council</a>. The street-cleaning contract was open for bids, and the Council selected the highest bidder at $422,000, rather than the lowest of $100,000 less, because of the political connections of the bidder. While this sort of bipartisan graft had previously been tolerated in Buffalo, Mayor Cleveland would have none of it. His veto message said, "I regard it as the culmination of a most bare-faced, impudent, and shameless scheme to betray the interests of the people, and to worse than squander the public money." The Council reversed itself and awarded the contract to the lowest bidder. Cleveland also asked the state legislature to form a Commission to develop a plan to improve the sewer system in Buffalo at a much lower cost than previously proposed locally; this plan was successfully adopted. For this, and other actions safeguarding public funds, Cleveland's reputation as a leader willing to purge government corruption began to spread beyond Erie County.

New York Democratic party officials began to consider Cleveland a possible nominee for governor. <a href="Daniel%20Manning">Daniel Manning</a>, a party insider who admired Cleveland's record, was instrumental in his candidacy. With a split in the state Republican party in 1882, the Democratic party was considered to be at an advantage; there were several contenders for that party's nomination. The two leading Democratic candidates were <a href="Roswell%20P.%20Flower">Roswell P. Flower</a> and <a href="Henry%20Warner%20Slocum">Henry W. Slocum</a>. Their factions deadlocked, and the convention could not agree on a nominee. Cleveland, in third place on the first ballot, picked up support in subsequent votes and emerged as the compromise choice. The Republican party remained divided against itself, and in the general election Cleveland emerged the victor, with 535,318 votes to Republican nominee <a href="Charles%20J.%20Folger">Charles J. Folger</a>'s 342,464. Cleveland's margin of victory was, at the time, the largest in a contested New York election; the Democrats also picked up seats in both houses of the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Legislature">New York State Legislature</a>.

Cleveland brought his opposition to needless spending to the governor's office; he promptly sent the legislature eight vetos in his first two months in office. The first to attract attention was his veto of a bill to reduce the fares on <a href="History%20of%20the%20New%20York%20City%20Subway%23Early%20steam%20and%20elevated%20railroads">New York City elevated trains</a> to five cents. The bill had broad support because the trains' owner, <a href="Jay%20Gould">Jay Gould</a>, was unpopular, and his fare increases were widely denounced. Cleveland, however, saw the bill as unjust—Gould had taken over the railroads when they were failing and had made the system solvent again. Moreover, Cleveland believed that altering Gould's franchise would violate the <a href="Contract%20Clause">Contract Clause</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">federal Constitution</a>. Despite the initial popularity of the fare-reduction bill, the newspapers praised Cleveland's veto. <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, then a member of the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Assembly">Assembly</a>, had reluctantly voted for the bill to which Cleveland objected, in a desire to punish the unscrupulous railroad barons. After the veto, Roosevelt reversed himself, as did many legislators, and the veto was sustained.

Cleveland's defiance of political corruption won him popular acclaim, and the enmity of the influential <a href="Tammany%20Hall">Tammany Hall</a> organization in New York City. Tammany, under its boss, <a href="John%20Kelly%20%28New%20York%20politician%29">John Kelly</a>, had disapproved of Cleveland's nomination as governor, and their resistance intensified after Cleveland openly opposed and prevented the re-election of their point man in the State Senate, <a href="Thomas%20F.%20Grady">Thomas F. Grady</a>. Cleveland also steadfastly opposed nominees of the Tammanyites, as well as bills passed as a result of their deal making. The loss of Tammany's support was offset by the support of Theodore Roosevelt and other reform-minded Republicans who helped Cleveland to pass several laws reforming municipal governments.

The Republicans convened in Chicago and nominated former Speaker of the House <a href="James%20G.%20Blaine">James G. Blaine</a> of <a href="Maine">Maine</a> for president on the fourth ballot. Blaine's nomination alienated many Republicans who viewed Blaine as ambitious and immoral. The GOP standard bearer was weakened by alienating the Mugwumps, and the Conkling faction, recently disenfranchised by President Arthur. Democratic party leaders saw the Republicans' choice as an opportunity to win the White House for the first time since 1856 if the right candidate could be found.

Among the Democrats, <a href="Samuel%20J.%20Tilden">Samuel J. Tilden</a> was the initial front-runner, having been the party's nominee in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201876">contested election of 1876</a>. After Tilden declined a nomination due to his poor health, his supporters shifted to several other contenders. Cleveland was among the leaders in early support, and <a href="Thomas%20F.%20Bayard">Thomas F. Bayard</a> of <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a>, <a href="Allen%20G.%20Thurman">Allen G. Thurman</a> of <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Freeman%20Miller">Samuel Freeman Miller</a> of <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a>, and <a href="Benjamin%20Butler%20%28politician%29">Benjamin Butler</a> of <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> also had considerable followings, along with various <a href="favorite%20son">favorite son</a>s. Each of the other candidates had hindrances to his nomination: Bayard had spoken in favor of <a href="secession">secession</a> in 1861, making him unacceptable to Northerners; Butler, conversely, was reviled throughout the South for his actions during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>; Thurman was generally well liked, but was growing old and infirm, and his views on the <a href="Bimetallism">silver question</a> were uncertain. Cleveland, too, had detractors—Tammany remained opposed to him—but the nature of his enemies made him still more friends. Cleveland led on the first ballot, with 392 votes out of 820. On the second ballot, Tammany threw its support behind Butler, but the rest of the delegates shifted to Cleveland, who won. <a href="Thomas%20A.%20Hendricks">Thomas A. Hendricks</a> of <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> was selected as his running mate.

Corruption in politics was the central issue in 1884; indeed, Blaine had over the span of his career been involved in several questionable deals. Cleveland's reputation as an opponent of corruption proved the Democrats' strongest asset. William C. Hudson created Cleveland's contextual campaign slogan "A public office is a public trust." Reform-minded Republicans called "<a href="Mugwump">Mugwump</a>s" denounced Blaine as corrupt and flocked to Cleveland. The Mugwumps, including such men as <a href="Carl%20Schurz">Carl Schurz</a> and <a href="Henry%20Ward%20Beecher">Henry Ward Beecher</a>, were more concerned with morality than with party, and felt Cleveland was a kindred soul who would promote civil service reform and fight for efficiency in government. At the same time the Democrats gained support from the Mugwumps, they lost some blue-collar workers to the <a href="United%20States%20Greenback%20Party">Greenback-Labor party</a>, led by ex-Democrat Benjamin Butler. In general, Cleveland abided by the precedent of minimizing presidential campaign travel and speechmaking; Blaine became one of the first to break with that tradition.

The campaign focused on the candidates' moral standards, as each side cast aspersions on their opponents. Cleveland's supporters rehashed the old allegations that Blaine had corruptly influenced legislation in favor of the <a href="Little%20Rock%20and%20Fort%20Smith%20Railroad">Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad</a> and the <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Railway">Union Pacific Railway</a>, later profiting on the sale of bonds he owned in both companies. Although the stories of Blaine's favors to the railroads had made the rounds eight years earlier, this time Blaine's correspondence was discovered, making his earlier denials less plausible. On some of the most damaging correspondence, Blaine had written "Burn this letter", giving Democrats the last line to their rallying cry: "Blaine, Blaine, James G. Blaine, the continental liar from the state of Maine, 'Burn this letter!"

Regarding Cleveland, commentator <a href="Jeff%20Jacoby%20%28columnist%29">Jeff Jacoby</a> notes that, "Not since George Washington had a candidate for President been so renowned for his rectitude." But the Republicans found a refutation buried in Cleveland's past. Aided by the sermons of Reverend George H. Ball, a minister from Buffalo, they made public the allegation that Cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child while he was a lawyer there, and their rallies soon included the chant "Ma, Ma, where's my Pa?". When confronted with the scandal, Cleveland immediately instructed his supporters to "Above all, tell the truth." Cleveland admitted to paying child support in 1874 to Maria Crofts Halpin, the woman who asserted he had fathered her son Oscar Folsom Cleveland and he assumed responsibility. Shortly before the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201884">1884 election</a>, the Republican media published an affidavit from Halpin in which she stated that until she met Cleveland, her "life was pure and spotless", and "there is not, and never was, a doubt as to the paternity of our child, and the attempt of Grover Cleveland, or his friends, to couple the name of Oscar Folsom, or any one else, with that boy, for that purpose is simply infamous and false."

The electoral votes of closely contested New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would determine the election. In New York, the Tammany Democrats decided that they would gain more from supporting a Democrat they disliked than a Republican who would do nothing for them. Blaine hoped that he would have more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine's mother was Irish Catholic, and he had been supportive of the <a href="Irish%20National%20Land%20League">Irish National Land League</a> while he was Secretary of State. The Irish, a significant group in three of the <a href="swing%20state">swing state</a>s, did appear inclined to support Blaine until a Republican, <a href="Samuel%20D.%20Burchard%20%28clergyman%29">Samuel D. Burchard</a>, gave a speech pivotal for the Democrats, denouncing them as the party of "Rum, <a href="Romanism">Romanism</a>, and Rebellion." The Democrats spread the word of this implied Catholic insult on the eve of the election. They also blistered Blaine for attending a banquet with some of New York City's wealthiest men.

After the votes were counted, Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by 1200 votes. While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219–182. Following the electoral victory, the "Ma, Ma ..." attack phrase gained a classic riposte: "Gone to the White House. Ha! Ha! Ha!"

Soon after taking office, Cleveland was faced with the task of filling all the government jobs for which the president had the power of appointment. These jobs were typically filled under the <a href="spoils%20system">spoils system</a>, but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was doing his job well, and would not appoint anyone solely on the basis of party service. He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers. Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats; this was especially the case with policy making positions. While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.

Cleveland also reformed other parts of the government. In 1887, he signed an act creating the <a href="Interstate%20Commerce%20Commission">Interstate Commerce Commission</a>. He and <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="William%20C.%20Whitney">William C. Whitney</a> undertook to modernize the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">navy</a> and canceled construction contracts that had resulted in inferior ships. Cleveland angered railroad investors by ordering an investigation of western lands they held by government grant. <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">Secretary of the Interior</a> <a href="Lucius%20Q.%20C.%20Lamar">Lucius Q. C. Lamar</a> charged that the rights of way for this land must be returned to the public because the railroads failed to extend their lines according to agreements. The lands were forfeited, resulting in the return of approximately .

Cleveland was the first Democratic President subject to the <a href="Tenure%20of%20Office%20Act%20%281867%29">Tenure of Office Act</a> which originated in 1867; the act purported to require the Senate to approve the dismissal of any presidential appointee who was originally subject to its advice and consent. Cleveland objected to the act in principle and his steadfast refusal to abide by it prompted its fall into disfavor and led to its ultimate repeal in 1887.

Cleveland faced a Republican Senate and often resorted to using his veto powers. He vetoed hundreds of private pension bills for <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> veterans, believing that if their pensions requests had already been rejected by the <a href="Pension%20Bureau">Pension Bureau</a>, Congress should not attempt to override that decision. When Congress, pressured by the <a href="Grand%20Army%20of%20the%20Republic">Grand Army of the Republic</a>, passed <a href="Dependent%20and%20Disability%20Pension%20Act">a bill granting pensions</a> for disabilities not caused by military service, Cleveland also vetoed that. Cleveland used the veto far more often than any president up to that time. In 1887, Cleveland issued his most well-known veto, . After a drought had ruined crops in several Texas counties, Congress appropriated $10,000 () to purchase seed grain for farmers there. Cleveland vetoed the expenditure. In his veto message, he espoused a theory of limited government:
One of the most volatile issues of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by <a href="Bimetallism">gold and silver</a>, or by <a href="gold%20standard">gold alone</a>. The issue cut across party lines, with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver, and both parties' representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard. Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply.

Cleveland and Treasury Secretary <a href="Daniel%20Manning">Daniel Manning</a> stood firmly on the side of the gold standard, and tried to reduce the amount of silver that the government was required to coin under the <a href="Bland-Allison%20Act">Bland-Allison Act</a> of 1878. Cleveland unsuccessfully appealed to Congress to repeal this law before he was inaugurated. Angered Westerners and Southerners advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents. In reply, one of the foremost silverites, <a href="Richard%20P.%20Bland">Richard P. Bland</a>, introduced a bill in 1886 that would require the government to coin unlimited amounts of silver, inflating the then-deflating currency. While Bland's bill was defeated, so was a bill the administration favored that would repeal any silver coinage requirement. The result was a retention of the status quo, and a postponement of the resolution of the Free Silver issue.

Another contentious financial issue at the time was the protective <a href="tariff">tariff</a>. While it had not been a central point in his campaign, Cleveland's opinion on the tariff was that of most Democrats: that the tariff ought to be reduced. Republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect American industries. American tariffs had been high since the Civil War, and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that the government was running a surplus.

In 1886, a bill to reduce the tariff was narrowly defeated in the House. The tariff issue was emphasized in <a href="United%20States%20House%20elections%2C%201886">the Congressional elections that year</a>, and the forces of protectionism increased their numbers in the Congress, but Cleveland continued to advocate tariff reform. As the surplus grew, Cleveland and the reformers called for a tariff for revenue only. His message to Congress in 1887 (quoted at right) highlighted the injustice of taking more money from the people than the government needed to pay its operating expenses. Republicans, as well as protectionist northern Democrats like <a href="Samuel%20J.%20Randall">Samuel J. Randall</a>, believed that American industries would fail without high tariffs, and they continued to fight reform efforts. <a href="Roger%20Q.%20Mills">Roger Q. Mills</a>, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed a bill to reduce the tariff from about 47% to about 40%. After significant exertions by Cleveland and his allies, the bill passed the House. The Republican Senate failed to come to agreement with the Democratic House, and the bill died in the <a href="United%20States%20Congress%20Conference%20committee">conference committee</a>. Dispute over the tariff persisted into the 1888 presidential election.

Cleveland was a committed non-interventionist who had campaigned in opposition to expansion and imperialism. He refused to promote the previous administration's <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> canal treaty, and generally was less of an expansionist in foreign relations. Cleveland's Secretary of State, <a href="Thomas%20F.%20Bayard">Thomas F. Bayard</a>, negotiated with <a href="Joseph%20Chamberlain">Joseph Chamberlain</a> of the United Kingdom over fishing rights in the waters off Canada, and struck a conciliatory note, despite the opposition of <a href="New%20England">New England</a>'s Republican Senators. Cleveland also withdrew from Senate consideration the <a href="Berlin%20Conference">Berlin Conference treaty</a> which guaranteed an open door for U.S. interests in <a href="Congo%20Free%20State">the Congo</a>.

Cleveland's military policy emphasized self-defense and modernization. In 1885 Cleveland appointed the <a href="Board%20of%20Fortifications">Board of Fortifications</a> under <a href="Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="William%20Crowninshield%20Endicott">William C. Endicott</a> to recommend a new <a href="seacoast%20defense%20in%20the%20United%20States">coastal fortification</a> system for the United States. No improvements to US coastal defenses had been made since the late 1870s. The Board's 1886 report recommended a massive $127 million construction program (equivalent to $ billion in ) at 29 <a href="Harbor%20Defense%20Command">harbors and river estuaries</a>, to include new breech-loading rifled guns, mortars, and <a href="submarine%20mines%20in%20United%20States%20harbor%20defense">naval minefields</a>. The Board and the program are usually called the Endicott Board and the Endicott Program. Most of the Board's recommendations were implemented, and by 1910, 27 locations were defended by over 70 forts. Many of the weapons remained in place until scrapped in World War II as they were replaced with new defenses. Endicott also proposed to Congress a system of examinations for Army officer promotions. For the Navy, the Cleveland administration spearheaded by <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="William%20Collins%20Whitney">William Collins Whitney</a> moved towards modernization, although no ships were constructed that could match the best European warships. Although completion of the four steel-hulled warships begun under the previous administration was delayed due to a corruption investigation and subsequent bankruptcy of their building yard, these ships were completed in a timely manner in <a href="naval%20shipyard">naval shipyard</a>s once the investigation was over. Sixteen additional steel-hulled warships were ordered by the end of 1888; these ships later proved vital in the Spanish–American War of 1898, and many served in World War I. These ships included the "second-class <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s" and , designed to match modern armored ships recently acquired by South American countries from Europe, such as the <a href="Brazilian%20battleship%20Riachuelo">Brazilian battleship "Riachuelo"</a>. Eleven <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a>s (including the famous ), one <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>, and one <a href="monitor%20%28warship%29">monitor</a> were also ordered, along with the experimental cruiser .

Cleveland, like a growing number of Northerners (and nearly all white Southerners) saw <a href="Reconstruction%20Era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction</a> as a failed experiment, and was reluctant to use federal power to enforce the <a href="Fifteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">15th Amendment</a> of the <a href="U.S.%20Constitution">U.S. Constitution</a>, which guaranteed voting rights to African Americans. Though Cleveland appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs, he allowed <a href="Frederick%20Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a> to continue in his post as <a href="recorder%20of%20deeds">recorder of deeds</a> in Washington, D.C. and appointed another black man (James Campbell Matthews, a former New York judge) to replace Douglass upon his resignation. His decision to replace Douglass with a black man was met with outrage, but Cleveland claimed to have known Matthews personally.

Although Cleveland had condemned the "outrages" against Chinese immigrants, he believed that Chinese immigrants were unwilling to <a href="Cultural%20assimilation">assimilate</a> into white society. Secretary of State <a href="Thomas%20F.%20Bayard">Thomas F. Bayard</a> negotiated an extension to the <a href="Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act">Chinese Exclusion Act</a>, and Cleveland lobbied the Congress to pass the <a href="Scott%20Act%20%281888%29">Scott Act</a>, written by Congressman <a href="William%20Lawrence%20Scott">William Lawrence Scott</a>, which prevented the return of Chinese immigrants who left the United States. The Scott Act easily passed both houses of Congress, and Cleveland signed it into law on October 1, 1888.

Cleveland viewed Native Americans as <a href="wards%20of%20the%20state">wards of the state</a>, saying in his first inaugural address that "[t]his guardianship involves, on our part, efforts for the improvement of their condition and enforcement of their rights." He encouraged the idea of cultural assimilation, pushing for the passage of the <a href="Dawes%20Act">Dawes Act</a>, which provided for distribution of Indian lands to individual members of tribes, rather than having them continued to be held in trust for the tribes by the federal government. While a conference of Native leaders endorsed the act, in practice the majority of Native Americans disapproved of it. Cleveland believed the Dawes Act would lift Native Americans out of poverty and encourage their assimilation into white society. It ultimately weakened the tribal governments and allowed individual Indians to sell land and keep the money.

In the month before Cleveland's 1885 inauguration, President Arthur opened four million acres of <a href="Winnebago%20%28tribe%29">Winnebago</a> and <a href="Crow%20Creek%20Reservation">Crow Creek</a> Indian lands in the <a href="Dakota%20Territory">Dakota Territory</a> to white settlement by executive order. Tens of thousands of settlers gathered at the border of these lands and prepared to take possession of them. Cleveland believed Arthur's order to be in violation of treaties with the tribes, and rescinded it on April 17 of that year, ordering the settlers out of the territory. Cleveland sent in eighteen <a href="company%20%28military%20unit%29">companies</a> of Army troops to enforce the treaties and ordered General <a href="Philip%20Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a>, at the time Commanding General of the U. S. Army, to investigate the matter.

Cleveland entered the White House as a bachelor, and his sister <a href="Rose%20Cleveland">Rose Cleveland</a> joined him, to act as hostess for the first two years of his administration. Unlike the previous bachelor president <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a>, Cleveland did not remain a bachelor for long. In 1885 the daughter of Cleveland's friend Oscar Folsom visited him in Washington. <a href="Frances%20Folsom%20Cleveland%20Preston">Frances Folsom</a> was a student at <a href="Wells%20College">Wells College</a>. When she returned to school, President Cleveland received her mother's permission to correspond with her, and they were soon engaged to be married. On June 2, 1886, Cleveland married Frances Folsom in the <a href="Blue%20Room%20%28White%20House%29">Blue Room</a> at the White House. He was the second president to wed while in office, and has been the only president married in the White House. This marriage was unusual, since Cleveland was the executor of Oscar Folsom's estate and had supervised Frances's upbringing after her father's death; nevertheless, the public took no exception to the match. At 21 years, Frances Folsom Cleveland was the youngest <a href="First%20Lady%20of%20the%20United%20States">First Lady</a> in history, and the public soon warmed to her beauty and warm personality.

The Clevelands had five children: <a href="Ruth%20Cleveland">Ruth</a> (1891–1904), <a href="Esther%20Cleveland">Esther</a> (1893–1980), Marion (1895–1977), <a href="Richard%20F.%20Cleveland">Richard</a> (1897–1974), and Francis Grover (1903–1995). British philosopher <a href="Philippa%20Foot">Philippa Foot</a> was their granddaughter.

Cleveland also claimed paternity of an additional child named Oscar Folsom Cleveland with Maria Croft Halpin who claimed the child was a product of rape.

During his first term, Cleveland successfully nominated two justices to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a>. The first, Lucius Q. C. Lamar, was a former <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> Senator who served in Cleveland's Cabinet as Interior Secretary. When <a href="William%20Burnham%20Woods">William Burnham Woods</a> died, Cleveland nominated Lamar to his seat in late 1887. While Lamar had been well liked as a Senator, his service under the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a> two decades earlier caused many Republicans to vote against him. Lamar's nomination was confirmed by the narrow margin of 32 to 28.

<a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice</a> <a href="Morrison%20Waite">Morrison Waite</a> died a few months later, and Cleveland nominated <a href="Melville%20Fuller">Melville Fuller</a> to fill his seat on April 30, 1888. Fuller accepted. He had previously declined Cleveland's nomination to the <a href="Civil%20Service%20Commission">Civil Service Commission</a>, preferring his Chicago law practice. The <a href="Senate%20Judiciary%20Committee">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> spent several months examining the little-known nominee, before the Senate confirmed the nomination 41 to 20.

Cleveland nominated 41 lower federal court judges in addition to his four Supreme Court justices. These included two judges to the <a href="United%20States%20circuit%20court">United States circuit court</a>s, nine judges to the <a href="United%20States%20Courts%20of%20Appeals">United States Courts of Appeals</a>, and 30 judges to the <a href="United%20States%20district%20courts">United States district courts</a>. Because Cleveland served terms both before and after Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the Courts of Appeals, he is one of only two presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies. The other, Benjamin Harrison, was in office at the time that the change was made. Thus, all of Cleveland's appointments to the circuit courts were made in his first term, and all of his appointments to the Courts of Appeals were made in his second.

The Republicans nominated <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a> of <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> for president and <a href="Levi%20P.%20Morton">Levi P. Morton</a> of New York for vice president. Cleveland was easily renominated at the <a href="1888%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">Democratic convention in St. Louis</a>.

Following Vice President <a href="Thomas%20A.%20Hendricks">Thomas A. Hendricks</a> death in 1885, the Democrats chose <a href="Allen%20G.%20Thurman">Allen G. Thurman</a> of Ohio to be Cleveland's new running mate.

The Republicans gained the upper hand in the campaign, as Cleveland's campaign was poorly managed by <a href="Calvin%20S.%20Brice">Calvin S. Brice</a> and <a href="William%20H.%20Barnum">William H. Barnum</a>, whereas Harrison had engaged more aggressive fundraisers and tacticians in <a href="Matthew%20Quay">Matt Quay</a> and <a href="John%20Wanamaker">John Wanamaker</a>.

The Republicans campaigned heavily on the tariff issue, turning out protectionist voters in the important industrial states of the North. Further, the Democrats in New York were divided over the gubernatorial candidacy of <a href="David%20B.%20Hill">David B. Hill</a>, weakening Cleveland's support in that swing state. A <a href="Murchison%20letter">letter from the British ambassador</a> supporting Cleveland caused a scandal which cost Cleveland votes in New York.

As in 1884, the election focused on the swing states of New York, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, and <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>. But unlike that year, when Cleveland had triumphed in all four, in 1888 he won only two, losing his home state of New York by 14,373 votes. The Republicans won Indiana, largely as the result of a fraudulent voting practice known as <a href="Blocks%20of%20Five">Blocks of Five</a>. Cleveland continued his duties diligently until the end of the term and began to look forward to return to private life.

As Frances Cleveland left the White House, she told a staff member, "Now, Jerry, I want you to take good care of all the furniture and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now, when we come back again." When asked when she would return, she responded, "We are coming back four years from today." In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City, where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, <a href="Francis%20Lynde%20Stetson">Stetson</a>, Tracy, and MacVeigh. This affiliation was more of an office-sharing arrangement, though quite compatible. Cleveland's law practice brought only a moderate income, perhaps because Cleveland spent considerable time at the couple's vacation home <a href="Gray%20Gables">Gray Gables</a> at Buzzard Bay, where fishing became his obsession. While they lived in New York, the Clevelands' first child, Ruth, was born in 1891.

The Harrison administration worked with Congress to pass the <a href="McKinley%20Tariff">McKinley Tariff</a>, an aggressively protectionist measure, and the <a href="Sherman%20Silver%20Purchase%20Act">Sherman Silver Purchase Act</a>, which increased money backed by silver; these were among policies Cleveland deplored as dangerous to the nation's financial health. At first he refrained from criticizing his successor, but by 1891 Cleveland felt compelled to speak out, addressing his concerns in an open letter to a meeting of reformers in New York. The "silver letter" thrust Cleveland's name back into the spotlight just as the 1892 election was approaching.

Cleveland's enduring reputation as chief executive and his recent pronouncements on the monetary issues made him a leading contender for the Democratic nomination. His leading opponent was <a href="David%20B.%20Hill">David B. Hill</a>, a Senator for New York. Hill united the anti-Cleveland elements of the Democratic party—silverites, protectionists, and Tammany Hall—but was unable to create a coalition large enough to deny Cleveland the nomination. Despite some desperate maneuvering by Hill, Cleveland was nominated on the first ballot at the <a href="1892%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">convention</a> in Chicago. For vice president, the Democrats chose to balance the ticket with <a href="Adlai%20E.%20Stevenson%20I">Adlai E. Stevenson</a> of Illinois, a silverite. Although the Cleveland forces preferred <a href="Isaac%20P.%20Gray">Isaac P. Gray</a> of Indiana for vice president, they accepted the convention favorite. As a supporter of <a href="United%20States%20Note">greenbacks</a> and Free Silver to inflate the currency and alleviate economic distress in the rural districts, Stevenson balanced the otherwise <a href="Hard%20money%20%28policy%29">hard-money</a>, <a href="gold%20standard">gold-standard</a> ticket headed by Cleveland.

The Republicans re-nominated President Harrison, making the 1892 election a rematch of the one four years earlier. Unlike the turbulent and controversial elections of 1876, 1884, and 1888, the 1892 election was, according to Cleveland biographer <a href="Allan%20Nevins">Allan Nevins</a>, "the cleanest, quietest, and most creditable in the memory of the post-war generation," in part because Harrison's wife, Caroline, was dying of tuberculosis. Harrison did not personally campaign at all. Following Caroline Harrison's death on October 25, two weeks before the national election, Cleveland and all of the other candidates stopped campaigning, thus making Election Day a somber and quiet event for the whole country as well as the candidates.

The issue of the tariff worked to the Republicans' advantage in 1888. The legislative revisions of the past four years also made imported goods so expensive that now many voters favored tariff reform and were skeptical of big business. Many Westerners, traditionally Republican voters, defected to <a href="James%20B.%20Weaver">James Weaver</a>, the candidate of the new <a href="Populist%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Populist Party</a>. Weaver promised Free Silver, generous veterans' pensions, and an <a href="Eight-hour%20day">eight-hour work day</a>. The Tammany Hall Democrats adhered to the national ticket, allowing a united Democratic party to carry New York. At the campaign's end, many Populists and labor supporters endorsed Cleveland after an attempt by the Carnegie Corporation to break the union during the <a href="Homestead%20strike">Homestead strike</a> in Pittsburgh and after a similar <a href="Coal%20Creek%20War">conflict between big business and labor at the Tennessee Coal and Iron Co</a>. The final result was a victory for Cleveland by wide margins in both the popular and electoral votes, and it was Cleveland's third consecutive popular vote plurality.

Shortly after Cleveland's second term began, the <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a> struck the stock market, and he soon faced an acute <a href="economic%20depression">economic depression</a>. The panic was worsened by the acute shortage of gold that resulted from the increased coinage of silver, and Cleveland called Congress into special session to deal with the problem. The debate over the coinage was as heated as ever, and the effects of the panic had driven more moderates to support repealing the coinage provisions of the <a href="Sherman%20Silver%20Purchase%20Act">Sherman Silver Purchase Act</a>. Even so, the silverites rallied their following at a convention in Chicago, and the House of Representatives debated for fifteen weeks before passing the repeal by a considerable margin. In the Senate, the repeal of silver coinage was equally contentious. Cleveland, forced against his better judgment to lobby the Congress for repeal, convinced enough Democrats – and along with eastern Republicans, they formed a 48–37 majority for repeal. Depletion of the Treasury's gold reserves continued, at a lesser rate, and subsequent bond issues replenished supplies of gold. At the time the repeal seemed a minor setback to silverites, but it marked the beginning of the end of silver as a basis for American currency.

Having succeeded in reversing the Harrison administration's silver policy, Cleveland sought next to reverse the effects of the <a href="McKinley%20tariff">McKinley tariff</a>. The <a href="Wilson-Gorman%20Tariff%20Act">Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act</a> was introduced by West Virginian Representative <a href="William%20Lyne%20Wilson">William L. Wilson</a> in December 1893. After lengthy debate, the bill passed the House by a considerable margin. The bill proposed moderate downward revisions in the tariff, especially on raw materials. The shortfall in revenue was to be made up by an <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a> of two percent on income above $4,000 ().

The bill was next considered in the Senate, where it faced stronger opposition from key Democrats led by <a href="Arthur%20Pue%20Gorman">Arthur Pue Gorman</a> of Maryland, who insisted on more protection for their states' industries than the Wilson bill allowed. The bill passed the Senate with more than 600 amendments attached that nullified most of the reforms. The <a href="American%20Sugar%20Refining%20Company">Sugar Trust</a> in particular lobbied for changes that favored it at the expense of the consumer. Cleveland was outraged with the final bill, and denounced it as a disgraceful product of the control of the Senate by trusts and business interests. Even so, he believed it was an improvement over the McKinley tariff and allowed it to become law without his signature.

In 1892, Cleveland had campaigned against the <a href="Lodge%20Bill">Lodge Bill</a>, which would have strengthened <a href="voting%20rights%20in%20the%20United%20States">voting rights protections</a> through the appointing of federal supervisors of congressional elections upon a petition from the citizens of any district. The <a href="Enforcement%20Act%20of%201871">Enforcement Act of 1871</a> had provided for a detailed federal overseeing of the electoral process, from registration to the certification of returns. Cleveland succeeded in ushering in the 1894 repeal of this law (ch. 25, 28 Stat. 36). The pendulum thus swung from stronger attempts to protect voting rights to the repealing of voting rights protections; this in turn led to unsuccessful attempts to have the federal courts protect voting rights in "<a href="Giles%20v.%20Harris">Giles v. Harris</a>", 189 U.S. 475 (1903), and "Giles v. Teasley", 193 U.S. 146 (1904).

The Panic of 1893 had damaged labor conditions across the United States, and the victory of anti-silver legislation worsened the mood of western laborers. A group of workingmen led by <a href="Jacob%20S.%20Coxey">Jacob S. Coxey</a> began to march east toward Washington, D.C. to protest Cleveland's policies. This group, known as <a href="Coxey%27s%20Army">Coxey's Army</a>, agitated in favor of a national roads program to give jobs to workingmen, and a weakened currency to help farmers pay their debts. By the time they reached Washington, only a few hundred remained, and when they were arrested the next day for walking on the lawn of the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">United States Capitol</a>, the group scattered. Even though Coxey's Army may not have been a threat to the government, it signaled a growing dissatisfaction in the West with Eastern monetary policies.

The <a href="Pullman%20Strike">Pullman Strike</a> had a significantly greater impact than Coxey's Army. A strike began against the <a href="Pullman%20Company">Pullman Company</a> over low wages and twelve-hour workdays, and sympathy strikes, led by <a href="American%20Railway%20Union">American Railway Union</a> leader <a href="Eugene%20V.%20Debs">Eugene V. Debs</a>, soon followed. By June 1894, 125,000 railroad workers were on strike, paralyzing the nation's commerce. Because the railroads carried the <a href="U.S.%20Postal%20Service">mail</a>, and because several of the affected lines were in <a href="Bankruptcy%20in%20the%20United%20States">federal receivership</a>, Cleveland believed a federal solution was appropriate. Cleveland obtained an injunction in federal court, and when the strikers refused to obey it, he sent federal troops into Chicago and 20 other rail centers. "If it takes the entire army and navy of the United States to deliver a postcard in Chicago", he proclaimed, "that card will be delivered." Most governors supported Cleveland except Democrat <a href="John%20P.%20Altgeld">John P. Altgeld</a> of Illinois, who became his bitter foe in 1896. Leading newspapers of both parties applauded Cleveland's actions, but the use of troops hardened the attitude of organized labor toward his administration.

Just before the 1894 election, Cleveland was warned by Francis Lynde Stetson, an advisor:

The warning was appropriate, for in the Congressional elections, Republicans won their biggest landslide in decades, taking full control of the House, while the Populists lost most of their support. Cleveland's factional enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in state after state, including full control in Illinois and Michigan, and made major gains in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states. Wisconsin and Massachusetts were two of the few states that remained under the control of Cleveland's allies. The Democratic opposition were close to controlling two-thirds of the vote at the 1896 national convention, which they needed to nominate their own candidate. They failed for lack of unity and a national leader, as Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld had been born in Germany and was ineligible to be nominated for president.

When Cleveland took office he faced the question of Hawaiian annexation. In his first term, he had supported free trade with Hawai'i and accepted an amendment that gave the United States a coaling and naval station in <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>. In the intervening four years, Honolulu businessmen of European and American ancestry had denounced Queen <a href="Liliuokalani">Liliuokalani</a> as a tyrant who rejected constitutional government. In early 1893 they <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii%23Overthrow%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Hawai%27i">overthrew her</a>, set up a republican government under <a href="Sanford%20B.%20Dole">Sanford B. Dole</a>, and sought to join the United States. The Harrison administration had quickly agreed with representatives of the new government on a treaty of annexation and submitted it to the Senate for approval. Five days after taking office on March 9, 1893, Cleveland withdrew the treaty from the Senate and sent former Congressman <a href="James%20Henderson%20Blount">James Henderson Blount</a> to Hawai'i to investigate the conditions there.

Cleveland agreed with Blount's report, which found the populace to be opposed to annexation. Liliuokalani initially refused to grant amnesty as a condition of her reinstatement, saying that she would either execute or banish the current government in Honolulu, but Dole's government refused to yield their position. By December 1893, the matter was still unresolved, and Cleveland referred the issue to Congress. In his message to Congress, Cleveland rejected the idea of annexation and encouraged the Congress to continue the American tradition of non-intervention (see excerpt at right). The Senate, under Democratic control but opposed to Cleveland, commissioned and produced the <a href="Morgan%20Report">Morgan Report</a>, which contradicted Blount's findings and found the overthrow was a completely internal affair. Cleveland dropped all talk of reinstating the Queen, and went on to recognize and maintain diplomatic relations with the new <a href="Republic%20of%20Hawaii">Republic of Hawaii</a>.

Closer to home, Cleveland adopted a broad interpretation of the <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine">Monroe Doctrine</a> that not only prohibited new European colonies, but also declared an American national interest in any matter of substance within the hemisphere. When Britain and <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> disagreed over the boundary between Venezuela and the colony of <a href="British%20Guiana">British Guiana</a>, Cleveland and Secretary of State <a href="Richard%20Olney">Richard Olney</a> protested. British Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Cecil%2C%203rd%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Lord Salisbury</a> and the British ambassador to Washington, <a href="Julian%20Pauncefote%2C%201st%20Baron%20Pauncefote">Julian Pauncefote</a>, misjudged how important successful resolution of the dispute was to the American government, having prolonged the crisis before ultimately accepting the American demand for arbitration. A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the matter, and in 1899 awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to British Guiana. But by standing with a Latin American nation against the encroachment of a colonial power, Cleveland improved relations with the United States' southern neighbors, and at the same time, the cordial manner in which the negotiations were conducted also made for good relations with Britain.

The second Cleveland administration was as committed to military modernization as the first, and ordered the first ships of a navy capable of offensive action. Construction continued on the Endicott program of <a href="Seacoast%20defense%20in%20the%20United%20States">coastal fortifications</a> begun under Cleveland's first administration. The adoption of the <a href="Krag%E2%80%93J%C3%B8rgensen">Krag–Jørgensen</a> rifle, the US Army's first bolt-action repeating rifle, was finalized. In 1895–96 <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="Hilary%20A.%20Herbert">Hilary A. Herbert</a>, having recently adopted the aggressive naval strategy advocated by Captain <a href="Alfred%20Thayer%20Mahan">Alfred Thayer Mahan</a>, successfully proposed ordering five <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s (the and es) and sixteen <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s. Completion of these ships nearly doubled the Navy's battleships and created a new torpedo boat force, which previously had only two boats. The battleships and seven of the torpedo boats were not completed until 1899–1901, after the Spanish–American War.

In the midst of the fight for repeal of Free Silver coinage in 1893, Cleveland sought the advice of the White House doctor, Dr. O'Reilly, about soreness on the roof of his mouth and a crater-like edge ulcer with a granulated surface on the left side of Cleveland's <a href="hard%20palate">hard palate</a>. Samples of the tumor were sent anonymously to the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Health%20and%20Medicine">Army Medical Museum</a>. The diagnosis was not a <a href="malignant">malignant</a> cancer, but instead an "<a href="epithelioma">epithelioma</a>".

Cleveland decided to have surgery secretly, to avoid further panic that might worsen the financial depression. The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland time to make a full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session. Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, <a href="Joseph%20D.%20Bryant">Dr. Joseph Bryant</a>, left for New York. The surgeons operated aboard the "<a href="USS%20Adelante%20%28SP-765%29">Oneida</a>", a yacht owned by Cleveland's friend <a href="Elias%20Cornelius%20Benedict">E. C. Benedict</a>, as it sailed off <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>. The surgery was conducted through the President's mouth, to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery. The team, sedating Cleveland with <a href="nitrous%20oxide">nitrous oxide</a> and <a href="Diethyl%20ether">ether</a>, successfully removed parts of his <a href="Maxilla">upper left jaw</a> and hard palate. The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland's mouth disfigured. During another surgery, Cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance. A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated. Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland's vacation. In 1917, one of the surgeons present on the "Oneida", <a href="William%20Williams%20Keen">Dr. William W. Keen</a>, wrote an article detailing the operation.

Cleveland enjoyed many years of life after the tumor was removed, and there was some debate as to whether it was actually malignant. Several doctors, including Dr. Keen, stated after Cleveland's death that the tumor was a <a href="carcinoma">carcinoma</a>.
Other suggestions included <a href="ameloblastoma">ameloblastoma</a> or a benign salivary mixed tumor (also known as a <a href="pleomorphic%20adenoma">pleomorphic adenoma</a>).
In the 1980s, analysis of the specimen finally confirmed the tumor to be <a href="verrucous%20carcinoma">verrucous carcinoma</a>, a low-grade epithelial cancer with a low potential for <a href="metastasis">metastasis</a>.

Cleveland's trouble with the Senate hindered the success of his nominations to the Supreme Court in his second term. In 1893, after the death of <a href="Samuel%20Blatchford">Samuel Blatchford</a>, Cleveland nominated <a href="William%20B.%20Hornblower">William B. Hornblower</a> to the Court. Hornblower, the head of a New York City law firm, was thought to be a qualified appointee, but his campaign against a New York machine politician had made Senator <a href="David%20B.%20Hill">David B. Hill</a> his enemy. Further, Cleveland had not consulted the Senators before naming his appointee, leaving many who were already opposed to Cleveland on other grounds even more aggrieved. The Senate rejected Hornblower's nomination on January 15, 1894, by a vote of 30 to 24.

Cleveland continued to defy the Senate by next appointing <a href="Wheeler%20Hazard%20Peckham">Wheeler Hazard Peckham</a> another New York attorney who had opposed Hill's machine in that state. Hill used all of his influence to block Peckham's confirmation, and on February 16, 1894, the Senate rejected the nomination by a vote of 32 to 41. Reformers urged Cleveland to continue the fight against Hill and to nominate <a href="Frederic%20Ren%C3%A9%20Coudert%2C%20Sr.">Frederic R. Coudert</a>, but Cleveland acquiesced in an inoffensive choice, that of Senator <a href="Edward%20Douglass%20White">Edward Douglass White</a> of <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, whose nomination was accepted unanimously. Later, in 1896, another vacancy on the Court led Cleveland to consider Hornblower again, but he declined to be nominated. Instead, Cleveland nominated <a href="Rufus%20Wheeler%20Peckham">Rufus Wheeler Peckham</a>, the brother of Wheeler Hazard Peckham, and the Senate confirmed the second Peckham easily.

No new states were <a href="Admission%20to%20the%20Union">admitted to the Union</a> during Cleveland's first term. On February 22, 1889, days before leaving office, the <a href="50th%20United%20States%20Congress">50th Congress</a> passed the <a href="Enabling%20Act%20of%201889">Enabling Act of 1889</a>, authorizing <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a>, <a href="South%20Dakota">South Dakota</a>, <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, and <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> to form state governments and to gain admission to the Union. All four officially became states in November 1889, during the first year of <a href="Presidency%20of%20Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison's administration</a>. During his second term, the <a href="53rd%20United%20States%20Congress">53rd United States Congress</a> passed an Enabling Act that permitted <a href="Utah">Utah</a> to apply for statehood. Cleveland signed it on July 16, 1894. Utah joined the Union as the 45th state on January 4, 1896.

Cleveland's agrarian and silverite enemies gained control of the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201896">Democratic party in 1896</a>, repudiated his administration and the gold standard, and nominated <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> on a <a href="Free%20Silver">Silver Platform</a>. Cleveland silently supported the <a href="National%20Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Gold Democrats'</a> third-party ticket that promised to defend the <a href="bimetallism">gold standard</a>, limit government and oppose high tariffs, but he declined their nomination for a third term. The party won only 100,000 votes in the general election, and <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a>, the Republican nominee, triumphed easily over Bryan. Agrarians nominated Bryan again in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201900">1900</a>. In <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201904">1904</a> the conservatives, with Cleveland's support, regained control of the Democratic Party and nominated <a href="Alton%20B.%20Parker">Alton B. Parker</a>.
After leaving the White House on March 4, 1897, Cleveland lived in retirement at his estate, <a href="Westland%20Mansion">Westland Mansion</a>, in <a href="Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Princeton, New Jersey</a>. For a time he was a trustee of <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>, and was one of the majority of trustees who preferred Dean West's plans for the Graduate School and undergraduate living over those of <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>, then president of the university. Cleveland consulted occasionally with President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> (1901–1909), but was financially unable to accept the chairmanship of the commission handling the <a href="Coal%20Strike%20of%201902">Coal Strike of 1902</a>. Cleveland still made his views known in political matters. In a 1905 article in "The Ladies Home Journal", Cleveland weighed in on the <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a> movement, writing that "sensible and responsible women do not want to vote. The relative positions to be assumed by men and women in the working out of our civilization were assigned long ago by a higher intelligence."

In 1906, a group of New Jersey Democrats promoted Cleveland as a possible candidate for the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a>. The incumbent, <a href="John%20F.%20Dryden">John F. Dryden</a>, was not seeking re-election, and some Democrats felt that the former president could attract the votes of some disaffected Republican legislators who might be drawn to Cleveland's statesmanship and conservatism.
Cleveland's health had been declining for several years, and in the autumn of 1907 he fell seriously ill. In 1908, he suffered a heart attack and died on June 24 at age 71. His last words were, "I have tried so hard to do right." He is buried in the <a href="Princeton%20Cemetery">Princeton Cemetery</a> of the <a href="Nassau%20Presbyterian%20Church">Nassau Presbyterian Church</a>.

In his first term in office, Cleveland sought a summer house to escape the heat and smells of Washington, D.C., near enough the capital. He secretly bought a farmhouse, Oak View (or Oak Hill), in a rural upland part of the District of Columbia, in 1886, and remodeled it into a <a href="Queen%20Anne%20style%20architecture%20in%20the%20United%20States">Queen Anne style</a> summer estate. He sold Oak View upon losing his bid for re-election in 1888. Not long thereafter, suburban residential development reached the area, which came to be known as Oak View, and then Cleveland Heights, and eventually <a href="Cleveland%20Park">Cleveland Park</a>. The Clevelands are depicted in local murals.

Grover Cleveland Hall at <a href="Buffalo%20State%20College">Buffalo State College</a> in Buffalo, New York. Cleveland Hall houses the offices of the college president, vice presidents, and other administrative functions and student services. Cleveland was a member of the first board of directors of the then Buffalo Normal School. <a href="Grover%20Cleveland%20Middle%20School%20%28Caldwell%2C%20New%20Jersey%29">Grover Cleveland Middle School</a> in his birthplace, <a href="Caldwell%2C%20New%20Jersey">Caldwell, New Jersey</a>, was named for him, as is <a href="Grover%20Cleveland%20High%20School%20%28Buffalo%2C%20New%20York%29">Grover Cleveland High School</a> in Buffalo, New York, and the town of <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Mississippi">Cleveland, Mississippi</a>. <a href="Mount%20Cleveland%20%28Alaska%29">Mount Cleveland</a>, a volcano in Alaska, is also named after him. In 1895 he became the first U.S. President who was filmed.

The first U.S. postage stamp to honor Cleveland appeared in 1923. This twelve-cent issue accompanied a thirteen-cent stamp in the same definitive series that depicted his old rival Benjamin Harrison. Cleveland's only two subsequent stamp appearances have been in issues devoted to the full roster of U.S. Presidents, released, respectively, in 1938 and 1986.

Cleveland's portrait was on the U.S. <a href="Large%20denominations%20of%20United%20States%20currency">$1000 bill</a> of series 1928 and series 1934. He also appeared on the first few issues of the <a href="United%20States%20twenty%20dollar%20bill%23Federal%20Reserve%20history">$20</a> <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20Note">Federal Reserve Note</a>s from 1914. Since he was both the 22nd and 24th president, he was featured on two separate dollar coins released in 2012 as part of the <a href="Presidential%20%241%20Coin%20Program">Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005</a>.

In 2013, Cleveland was inducted into the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">New Jersey Hall of Fame</a>.

Grus (constellation)

Grus (, or colloquially ) is a <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the <a href="southern%20sky">southern sky</a>. Its name is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for the <a href="crane%20%28bird%29">crane</a>, a type of bird. It is one of twelve constellations conceived by <a href="Petrus%20Plancius">Petrus Plancius</a> from the observations of <a href="Pieter%20Dirkszoon%20Keyser">Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser</a> and <a href="Frederick%20de%20Houtman">Frederick de Houtman</a>. Grus first appeared on a celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and <a href="Jodocus%20Hondius">Jodocus Hondius</a> and was depicted in <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>'s star atlas "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>" of 1603. French explorer and astronomer <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille</a> gave <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s to its stars in 1756, some of which had been previously considered part of the neighbouring constellation <a href="Piscis%20Austrinus">Piscis Austrinus</a>. The constellations Grus, <a href="Pavo%20%28constellation%29">Pavo</a>, <a href="Phoenix%20%28constellation%29">Phoenix</a> and <a href="Tucana">Tucana</a> are collectively known as the "Southern Birds".

The constellation's brightest star, <a href="Alpha%20Gruis">Alpha Gruis</a>, is also known as Alnair and appears as a 1.7-<a href="Apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a> blue-white star. <a href="Beta%20Gruis">Beta Gruis</a> is a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> <a href="variable%20star">variable star</a> with a minimum magnitude of 2.3 and a maximum magnitude of 2.0. Six star systems have been found to have <a href="exoplanet">planets</a>: the red dwarf <a href="Gliese%20832">Gliese 832</a> is one of the closest stars to Earth to have a planetary system. Another—<a href="WASP-95">WASP-95</a>—has a planet that orbits every two days. <a href="Deep-sky%20object">Deep-sky object</a>s found in Grus include the <a href="planetary%20nebula">planetary nebula</a> <a href="IC%205148">IC 5148</a>, also known as the Spare Tyre Nebula, and a group of four interacting galaxies known as the Grus Quartet.

The stars that form Grus were originally considered part of the neighbouring constellation <a href="Piscis%20Austrinus">Piscis Austrinus</a> (the southern fish), with <a href="Gamma%20Gruis">Gamma Gruis</a> seen as part of the fish's tail. The stars were first defined as a separate constellation by the Dutch astronomer <a href="Petrus%20Plancius">Petrus Plancius</a>, who created twelve new constellations based on the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers <a href="Pieter%20Dirkszoon%20Keyser">Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser</a> and <a href="Frederick%20de%20Houtman">Frederick de Houtman</a>, who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the "<a href="First%20Dutch%20Expedition%20to%20Indonesia">Eerste Schipvaart</a>", to the <a href="East%20Indies">East Indies</a>. Grus first appeared on a 35-centimetre-diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> by Plancius with <a href="Jodocus%20Hondius">Jodocus Hondius</a>. Its first depiction in a celestial atlas was in the German cartographer <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>'s "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>" of 1603. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue the same year under the Dutch name "Den Reygher", "The Heron", but Bayer followed Plancius and Hondius in using Grus.

An alternative name for the constellation, "Phoenicopterus" (Latin "<a href="flamingo">flamingo</a>"), was used briefly during the early 17th century, seen in the 1605 work "Cosmographiae Generalis" by Paul Merula of <a href="Leiden%20University">Leiden University</a> and a c. 1625 globe by Dutch globe maker Pieter van den Keere. Astronomer Ian Ridpath has reported the symbolism likely came from Plancius originally, who had worked with both of these people. Grus and the nearby constellations <a href="Phoenix%20%28constellation%29">Phoenix</a>, <a href="Tucana">Tucana</a> and <a href="Pavo%20%28constellation%29">Pavo</a> are collectively called the "Southern Birds".

The stars that correspond to Grus were generally too far south to be seen from China. In <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">Chinese astronomy</a>, Gamma and <a href="Lambda%20Gruis">Lambda Gruis</a> may have been included in the tub-shaped asterism "Bàijiù", along with stars from Piscis Austrinus. In Central Australia, the <a href="Upper%20Arrernte%20language">Arrernte</a> and <a href="Luritja%20dialect">Luritja</a> people living on a mission in <a href="Hermannsburg%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Hermannsburg</a> viewed the sky as divided between them, east of the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> representing Arrernte camps and west denoting Luritja camps. <a href="Alpha%20Gruis">Alpha</a> and <a href="Beta%20Gruis">Beta Gruis</a>, along with <a href="Fomalhaut">Fomalhaut</a>, <a href="Alpha%20Pavonis">Alpha Pavonis</a> and the stars of <a href="Musca">Musca</a>, were all claimed by the Arrernte.

Grus is bordered by Piscis Austrinus to the north, <a href="Sculptor%20%28constellation%29">Sculptor</a> to the northeast, Phoenix to the east, Tucana to the south, <a href="Indus%20%28constellation%29">Indus</a> to the southwest, and <a href="Microscopium">Microscopium</a> to the west. Bayer straightened the tail of Piscis Austrinus to make way for Grus in his "Uranometria". Covering 366 square degrees, it ranks 45th of the 88 <a href="Lists%20of%20constellations">modern constellations</a> in size and covers 0.887% of the night sky. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is "Gru". The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined as a polygon of 6 segments. In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between −36.31° and −56.39°. Grus is located too far south to be seen by observers in the British Isles and the northern United States, though it can easily be seen from <a href="Florida">Florida</a> or <a href="California">California</a>; the whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude <a href="33rd%20parallel%20north">33°N</a>.

Keyser and de Houtman assigned twelve stars to the constellation. Bayer depicted Grus on his chart, but did not assign its stars <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s. French explorer and astronomer <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille</a> labelled them Alpha to Phi in 1756 with some omissions. In 1879, American astronomer <a href="Benjamin%20Apthorp%20Gould">Benjamin Gould</a> added Kappa, Nu, Omicron and Xi, which had all been catalogued by Lacaille but not given Bayer designations. Lacaille considered them too faint, while Gould thought otherwise. Xi Gruis had originally been placed in Microscopium. Conversely, Gould dropped Lacaille's Sigma as he thought it was too dim.

Grus has several bright stars. Marking the left wing is Alpha Gruis, a blue-white star of spectral type B6V and <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 1.7, around 101 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s from Earth. Its traditional name, Alnair, means "the bright one" and refers to its status as the brightest star in Grus (although the Arabians saw it as the brightest star in the Fish's tail, as Grus was then depicted).<a href="http%3A//www.constellationsofwords.com/stars/Alnair.html">Alnair</a> Alnair is around 380 times as <a href="luminosity">luminous</a> and has over 3 times the diameter of the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>. Lying 5 degrees west of Alnair, denoting the Crane's heart is Beta Gruis (the proper name is Tiaki), a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> of spectral type M5III. It has a diameter of 0.8 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s (AU) (if placed in the Solar System it would extend to the orbit of Venus) located around 170 light-years from Earth. It is a <a href="variable%20star">variable star</a> with a minimum magnitude of 2.3 and a maximum magnitude of 2.0. An imaginary line drawn from the Great Square of <a href="Pegasus%20%28constellation%29">Pegasus</a> through Fomalhaut will lead to Alnair and Beta Gruis.

Lying in the northwest corner of the constellation and marking the crane's eye is Gamma Gruis , a blue-white <a href="subgiant">subgiant</a> of spectral type B8III and magnitude 3.0 lying around 211 light-years from Earth. Also known as Al Dhanab, it has finished fusing its core hydrogen and has begun cooling and expanding, which will see it transform into a red giant.

There are several naked-eye <a href="double%20star">double star</a>s in Grus. Forming a triangle with Alnair and Beta, Delta Gruis is an optical double whose components—<a href="Delta1%20Gruis">Delta</a> and <a href="Delta2%20Gruis">Delta</a>—are separated by 45 arcseconds. Delta is a <a href="yellow%20giant">yellow giant</a> of spectral type G7III and magnitude 4.0, 309 light-years from Earth, and may have its own magnitude 12 <a href="K-type%20main-sequence%20star">orange dwarf</a> companion. Delta is a red giant of spectral type M4.5III and semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 3.99 and 4.2, located 325 light-years from Earth. It has around 3 times the mass and 135 times the diameter of our sun. Mu Gruis, composed of <a href="Mu1%20Gruis">Mu</a> and <a href="Mu2%20Gruis">Mu</a>, is also an optical double—both stars are yellow giants of spectral type G8III around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun with surface temperatures of around 4900 K. Mu is the brighter of the two at magnitude 4.8 located around 275 light-years from Earth, while Mu the dimmer at magnitude 5.11 lies 265 light-years distant from Earth. Pi Gruis, an optical double with a variable component, is composed of <a href="Pi1%20Gruis">Pi Gruis</a> and <a href="Pi2%20Gruis">Pi</a>. Pi is a <a href="semiregular%20variable%20star">semi-regular</a> red giant of spectral type S5, ranging from magnitude 5.31 to 7.01 over a period of 191 days, and is around 532 light-years from Earth. One of the brightest S-class stars to Earth viewers, it has a companion star of apparent magnitude 10.9 with sunlike properties, being a <a href="G-type%20main-sequence%20star">yellow main sequence star</a> of spectral type G0V. The pair make up a likely binary system. Pi is a <a href="giant%20star">giant star</a> of spectral type F3III-IV located around 130 light-years from Earth, and is often brighter than its companion at magnitude 5.6. Marking the right wing is <a href="Theta%20Gruis">Theta Gruis</a>, yet another double star, lying 5 degrees east of Delta and Delta.

<a href="RZ%20Gruis">RZ Gruis</a> is a binary system of apparent magnitude 12.3 with occasional dimming to 13.4, whose components—a <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a> and <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> star—are thought to orbit each other roughly every 8.5 to 10 hours. It belongs to the UX Ursae Majoris subgroup of <a href="cataclysmic%20variable%20star">cataclysmic variable star</a> systems, where material from the donor star is drawn to the white dwarf where it forms an <a href="accretion%20disc">accretion disc</a> that remains bright and outshines the two component stars. The system is poorly understood, though the donor star has been calculated to be of spectral type F5V. These stars have spectra very similar to novae that have returned to quiescence after outbursts, yet they have not been observed to have erupted themselves. The <a href="American%20Association%20of%20Variable%20Star%20Observers">American Association of Variable Star Observers</a> recommends watching them for future events. <a href="CE%20Gruis">CE Gruis</a> (also known as Grus V-1) is a faint (magnitude 18–21) star system also composed of a white dwarf and donor star; in this case the two are so close they are <a href="Tidal%20locking">tidally locked</a>. Known as <a href="Polar%20%28cataclysmic%20variable%20star%29">polars</a>, material from the donor star does not form an accretion disc around the white dwarf, but rather streams directly onto it.

Six star systems are thought to have planetary systems. <a href="Tau1%20Gruis">Tau Gruis</a> is a yellow star of magnitude 6.0 located around 106 light-years away. It may be a main sequence star or be just beginning to depart from the sequence as it expands and cools. In 2002 the star was found to have a planetary companion. <a href="HD%20215456">HD 215456</a>, <a href="HD%20213240">HD 213240</a> and <a href="WASP-95">WASP-95</a> are yellow sunlike stars discovered to have two planets, a planet and a remote <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a>, and a <a href="hot%20Jupiter">hot Jupiter</a>, respectively; this last—WASP-95b—completes an orbit round its sun in a mere two days. <a href="Gliese%20832">Gliese 832</a> is a red dwarf of spectral type M1.5V and apparent magnitude 8.66 located only 16.1 light-years distant; hence it is one of the nearest stars to the Solar System. A <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>-like planet—<a href="Gliese%20832%20b">Gliese 832 b</a>—orbiting the red dwarf over a period of 9.4±0.4 years was discovered in 2008. <a href="WISE%202220%E2%88%923628">WISE 2220−3628</a> is a <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a> of spectral type Y, and hence one of the coolest star-like objects known. It has been calculated as being around 26 light-years distant from Earth.

Nicknamed the spare-tyre nebula, <a href="IC%205148">IC 5148</a> is a <a href="planetary%20nebula">planetary nebula</a> located around 1 degree west of Lambda Gruis. Around 3000 light-years distant, it is expanding at 50 kilometres a second, one of the fastest rates of expansion of all planetary nebulae.

Northeast of Theta Gruis are four interacting galaxies known as the Grus Quartet. These galaxies are <a href="NGC%207552">NGC 7552</a>, <a href="NGC%207590">NGC 7590</a>, <a href="NGC%207599">NGC 7599</a>, and <a href="NGC%207582">NGC 7582</a>. The latter three galaxies occupy an area of sky only 10 arcminutes across and are sometimes referred to as the "Grus Triplet," although all four are part of a larger loose group of galaxies called the IC 1459 Grus Group. NGC 7552 and 7582 are exhibiting high <a href="Starburst%20galaxy">starburst</a> activity; this is thought to have arisen because of the tidal forces from interacting. Located on the border of Grus with Piscis Austrinus, <a href="IC%201459">IC 1459</a> is a peculiar E3 giant <a href="elliptical%20galaxy">elliptical galaxy</a>. It has a fast counterrotating stellar core, and shells and ripples in its outer region. The galaxy has an apparent magnitude of 11.9 and is around 80 million light-years distant.

<a href="NGC%207424">NGC 7424</a> is a <a href="barred%20spiral%20galaxy">barred spiral galaxy</a> with an apparent magnitude of 10.4. located around 4 degrees west of the Grus Triplet. Approximately 37.5 million light-years distant, it is about 100,000 light-years in diameter, has well defined spiral arms and is thought to resemble the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>. Two <a href="ultraluminous%20X-ray%20source">ultraluminous X-ray source</a>s and one <a href="supernova">supernova</a> have been observed in NGC 7424. <a href="SN%202001ig">SN 2001ig</a> was discovered in 2001 and classified as a <a href="Type%20IIb%20supernova%23Type%20IIb%20supernovae">Type IIb supernova</a>, one that initially showed a weak hydrogen line in its <a href="stellar%20spectrum">spectrum</a>, but this emission later became undetectable and was replaced by lines of oxygen, magnesium and calcium, as well as other features that resembled the spectrum of a <a href="Type%20Ib%20supernova">Type Ib supernova</a>. A massive star of <a href="spectral%20type">spectral type</a> F, A or B is thought to be the surviving binary companion to SN 2001ig, which was believed to have been a <a href="Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet%20star">Wolf–Rayet star</a>.

Guy Fawkes

Guy Fawkes (; 13 April 1570 – 31 January 1606), also known as Guido Fawkes while fighting for the Spanish, was a member of a group of provincial <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">English Catholics</a> who planned the failed <a href="Gunpowder%20Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a> of 1605. He was born and educated in <a href="York">York</a>, England; his father died when Fawkes was eight years old, after which his mother married a <a href="Recusancy">recusant</a> Catholic.

Fawkes converted to Catholicism and left for mainland Europe, where he fought for Catholic Spain in the <a href="Eighty%20Years%27%20War">Eighty Years' War</a> against Protestant Dutch <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">reformers</a> in the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a>. He travelled to Spain to seek support for a Catholic rebellion in England without success. He later met <a href="Robert%20and%20Thomas%20Wintour">Thomas Wintour</a>, with whom he returned to England, and Wintour introduced him to <a href="Robert%20Catesby">Robert Catesby</a>, who planned to assassinate and restore a Catholic monarch to the throne. The plotters leased an <a href="undercroft">undercroft</a> beneath the House of Lords, and Fawkes was placed in charge of the gunpowder which they stockpiled there. The authorities were prompted by an anonymous letter to search <a href="Westminster%20Palace">Westminster Palace</a> during the early hours of 5 November, and they found Fawkes guarding the explosives. He was questioned and tortured over the next few days, and he finally confessed.

Immediately before his execution on 31 January, Fawkes fell from the scaffold where he was to be hanged and broke his neck, thus avoiding the agony of being <a href="hanged%2C%20drawn%20and%20quartered">hanged, drawn and quartered</a>. He became synonymous with the Gunpowder Plot, the failure of which has been commemorated in Britain as <a href="Guy%20Fawkes%20Night">Guy Fawkes Night</a> since 5 November 1605, when his effigy is traditionally burned on a bonfire, commonly accompanied by fireworks.

Guy Fawkes was born in 1570 in Stonegate, <a href="York">York</a>. He was the second of four children born to Edward Fawkes, a <a href="proctor">proctor</a> and an advocate of the <a href="consistory%20court">consistory court</a> at York, and his wife, Edith. Guy's parents were regular communicants of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, as were his paternal grandparents; his grandmother, born Ellen Harrington, was the daughter of a prominent merchant, who served as <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20York">Lord Mayor of York</a> in 1536. Guy's mother's family were <a href="Recusancy">recusant Catholics</a>, and his cousin, Richard Cowling, became a <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> priest. "Guy" was an uncommon name in England, but may have been popular in York on account of a local notable, Sir <a href="Guy%20Fairfax">Guy Fairfax</a> of Steeton.

The date of Fawkes's birth is unknown, but he was <a href="baptism">baptised</a> in the church of <a href="St%20Michael%20le%20Belfrey">St Michael le Belfrey</a> on 16 April. As the customary gap between birth and baptism was three days, he was probably born about 13 April. In 1568, Edith had given birth to a daughter named Anne, but the child died aged about seven weeks, in November that year. She bore two more children after Guy: Anne (b. 1572), and Elizabeth (b. 1575). Both were married, in 1599 and 1594 respectively.

In 1579, when Guy was eight years old, his father died. His mother remarried several years later, to the Catholic Dionis Baynbrigge (or Denis Bainbridge) of <a href="Scotton%2C%20Harrogate">Scotton, Harrogate</a>. Fawkes may have become a Catholic through the Baynbrigge family's recusant tendencies, and also the Catholic branches of the Pulleyn and Percy families of Scotton, but also from his time at <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20School%2C%20York">St. Peter's School</a> in York. A governor of the school had spent about 20 years in prison for recusancy, and its headmaster, John Pulleyn, came from a family of noted Yorkshire recusants, the Pulleyns of <a href="Blubberhouses">Blubberhouses</a>. In her 1915 work "The Pulleynes of Yorkshire", author Catharine Pullein suggested that Fawkes's Catholic education came from his Harrington relatives, who were known for harbouring priests, one of whom later accompanied Fawkes to <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> in 1592–1593. Fawkes's fellow students included <a href="John%20and%20Christopher%20Wright">John Wright</a> and his brother <a href="Christopher%20Wright%20%28plotter%29">Christopher</a> (both later involved with Fawkes in the <a href="Gunpowder%20Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a>) and <a href="Oswald%20Tesimond">Oswald Tesimond</a>, <a href="Edward%20Oldcorne">Edward Oldcorne</a> and Robert Middleton, who became priests (the latter executed in 1601).

After leaving school Fawkes entered the service of <a href="Anthony%20Browne%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Montagu">Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu</a>. The Viscount took a dislike to Fawkes and after a short time dismissed him; he was subsequently employed by <a href="Anthony-Maria%20Browne%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Montagu">Anthony-Maria Browne, 2nd Viscount Montagu</a>, who succeeded his grandfather at the age of 18. At least one source claims that Fawkes married and had a son, but no known contemporary accounts confirm this.

In October 1591 Fawkes sold the estate in <a href="Clifton%2C%20York">Clifton</a> in York that he had inherited from his father. He travelled to the continent to fight in the <a href="Eighty%20Years%20War">Eighty Years War</a> for Catholic Spain against the new <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a> and, from 1595 until the <a href="Peace%20of%20Vervins">Peace of Vervins</a> in 1598, France. Although England was not by then engaged in land operations against Spain, the two countries were <a href="Anglo-Spanish%20War%20%281585%29">still at war</a>, and the <a href="Spanish%20Armada">Spanish Armada</a> of 1588 was only five years in the past. He joined <a href="William%20Stanley%20%28Elizabethan%29">Sir William Stanley</a>, an English Catholic and veteran commander in his mid-fifties who had raised an army in Ireland to fight in <a href="Robert%20Dudley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">Leicester's expedition to the Netherlands</a>. Stanley had been held in high regard by <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a>, but following his surrender of <a href="Deventer">Deventer</a> to the Spanish in 1587 he, and most of his troops, had switched sides to serve Spain. Fawkes became an <a href="alf%C3%A9rez%20%28rank%29">alférez</a> or junior officer, fought well at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Calais%20%281596%29">siege of Calais in 1596</a>, and by 1603 had been recommended for a <a href="captaincy">captaincy</a>. That year, he travelled to Spain to seek support for a Catholic rebellion in England. He used the occasion to adopt the Italian version of his name, Guido, and in his memorandum described <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I</a> (who became king of England that year) as "a heretic", who intended "to have all of the Papist sect driven out of England." He denounced Scotland, and the King's <a href="favourite">favourite</a>s among the Scottish nobles, writing "it will not be possible to reconcile these two nations, as they are, for very long". Although he was received politely, the court of <a href="Philip%20III%20of%20Spain">Philip III</a> was unwilling to offer him any support.

In 1604 Fawkes became involved with a small group of English Catholics, led by <a href="Robert%20Catesby">Robert Catesby</a>, who planned to assassinate the <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">King James</a> and replace him with his daughter, third in the line of succession, <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Bohemia">Princess Elizabeth</a>. Fawkes was described by the Jesuit priest and former school friend <a href="Oswald%20Tesimond">Oswald Tesimond</a> as "pleasant of approach and cheerful of manner, opposed to quarrels and strife ... loyal to his friends". Tesimond also claimed Fawkes was "a man highly skilled in matters of war", and that it was this mixture of piety and professionalism that endeared him to his fellow conspirators. The author <a href="Antonia%20Fraser">Antonia Fraser</a> describes Fawkes as "a tall, powerfully built man, with thick reddish-brown hair, a flowing moustache in the tradition of the time, and a bushy reddish-brown beard", and that he was "a man of action ... capable of intelligent argument as well as physical endurance, somewhat to the surprise of his enemies."

The first meeting of the five central conspirators took place on Sunday 20 May 1604, at an inn called the Duck and Drake, in the fashionable <a href="Strand%2C%20London">Strand</a> district of London. Catesby had already proposed at an earlier meeting with <a href="Robert%20and%20Thomas%20Wintour">Thomas Wintour</a> and John Wright to kill the King and his government by blowing up "the Parliament House with gunpowder". Wintour, who at first objected to the plan, was convinced by Catesby to travel to the continent to seek help. Wintour met with the Constable of Castile, the exiled Welsh spy Hugh Owen, and Sir William Stanley, who said that Catesby would receive no support from Spain. Owen did, however, introduce Wintour to Fawkes, who had by then been away from England for many years, and thus was largely unknown in the country. Wintour and Fawkes were contemporaries; each was militant, and had first-hand experience of the unwillingness of the Spaniards to help. Wintour told Fawkes of their plan to "doe some whatt in Ingland if the pece with Spaine healped us nott", and thus in April 1604 the two men returned to England. Wintour's news did not surprise Catesby; despite positive noises from the Spanish authorities, he feared that "the deeds would nott answere".

One of the conspirators, <a href="Thomas%20Percy%20%28plotter%29">Thomas Percy</a>, was promoted in June 1604, gaining access to a house in London that belonged to John Whynniard, Keeper of the King's Wardrobe. Fawkes was installed as a caretaker and began using the pseudonym John Johnson, servant to Percy. The contemporaneous account of the prosecution (taken from Thomas Wintour's confession) claimed that the conspirators attempted to dig a tunnel from beneath Whynniard's house to Parliament, although this story may have been a government fabrication; no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found; Fawkes himself did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation, but even then he could not locate the tunnel. If the story is true, however, by December 1604 the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords. They ceased their efforts when, during tunnelling, they heard a noise from above. Fawkes was sent out to investigate, and returned with the news that the tenant's widow was clearing out a nearby <a href="undercroft">undercroft</a>, directly beneath the House of Lords.

The plotters purchased the lease to the room, which also belonged to John Whynniard. Unused and filthy, it was considered an ideal hiding place for the gunpowder the plotters planned to store. According to Fawkes, 20 barrels of gunpowder were brought in at first, followed by 16 more on 20 July. On 28 July however, the ever-present threat of the plague delayed the opening of Parliament until Tuesday, 5 November.

In an attempt to gain foreign support, in May 1605 Fawkes travelled overseas and informed Hugh Owen of the plotters' plan. At some point during this trip his name made its way into the files of <a href="Robert%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury</a>, who employed a network of spies across Europe. One of these spies, Captain William Turner, may have been responsible. Although the information he provided to Salisbury usually amounted to no more than a vague pattern of invasion reports, and included nothing which regarded the Gunpowder Plot, on 21 April he told how Fawkes was to be brought by Tesimond to England. Fawkes was a well-known Flemish mercenary, and would be introduced to "Mr Catesby" and "honourable friends of the nobility and others who would have arms and horses in readiness". Turner's report did not, however, mention Fawkes's pseudonym in England, John Johnson, and did not reach Cecil until late in November, well after the plot had been discovered.

It is uncertain when Fawkes returned to England, but he was back in London by late August 1605, when he and Wintour discovered that the gunpowder stored in the undercroft had decayed. More gunpowder was brought into the room, along with firewood to conceal it. Fawkes's final role in the plot was settled during a series of meetings in October. He was to light the fuse and then escape across the Thames. Simultaneously, a revolt in the Midlands would help to ensure the capture of Princess Elizabeth. Acts of <a href="regicide">regicide</a> were frowned upon, and Fawkes would therefore head to <a href="Continental%20Europe">the continent</a>, where he would explain to the Catholic powers his holy duty to kill the King and his retinue.

A few of the conspirators were concerned about fellow Catholics who would be present at Parliament during the opening. On the evening of 26 October, <a href="William%20Parker%2C%204th%20Baron%20Monteagle">Lord Monteagle</a> received an anonymous letter warning him to stay away, and to "retyre youre self into yowre contee whence yow maye expect the event in safti for ... they shall receyve a terrible blowe this parleament". Despite quickly becoming aware of the letterinformed by one of Monteagle's servantsthe conspirators resolved to continue with their plans, as it appeared that it "was clearly thought to be a hoax". Fawkes checked the undercroft on 30 October, and reported that nothing had been disturbed. Monteagle's suspicions had been aroused, however, and the letter was shown to King James. The King ordered <a href="Thomas%20Knyvet%2C%201st%20Baron%20Knyvet">Sir Thomas Knyvet</a> to conduct a search of the cellars underneath Parliament, which he did in the early hours of 5 November. Fawkes had taken up his station late on the previous night, armed with a slow match and a watch given to him by Percy "becaus he should knowe howe the time went away". He was found leaving the cellar, shortly after midnight, and arrested. Inside, the barrels of gunpowder were discovered hidden under piles of firewood and coal.

Fawkes gave his name as John Johnson and was first interrogated by members of the King's <a href="Privy%20chamber">Privy chamber</a>, where he remained defiant. When asked by one of the lords what he was doing in possession of so much gunpowder, Fawkes answered that his intention was "to blow you Scotch beggars back to your native mountains." He identified himself as a 36-year-old Catholic from Netherdale in Yorkshire, and gave his father's name as Thomas and his mother's as Edith Jackson. Wounds on his body noted by his questioners he explained as the effects of <a href="pleurisy">pleurisy</a>. Fawkes admitted his intention to blow up the House of Lords, and expressed regret at his failure to do so. His steadfast manner earned him the admiration of King James, who described Fawkes as possessing "a Roman resolution".

James's admiration did not, however, prevent him from ordering on 6 November that "John Johnson" be tortured, to reveal the names of his co-conspirators. He directed that the torture be light at first, referring to the use of <a href="handcuffs">manacles</a>, but more severe if necessary, authorising the use of <a href="Rack%20%28torture%29">the rack</a>: "the gentler Tortures are to be first used unto him "et sic per gradus ad ima tenditur" [and so by degrees proceeding to the worst]". Fawkes was transferred to the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>. The King composed a list of questions to be put to "Johnson", such as ""as to what he is", For I can never yet hear of any man that knows him", "When and where he learned to speak French?", and "If he was a Papist, who brought him up in it?" The room in which Fawkes was interrogated subsequently became known as the Guy Fawkes Room.
<a href="William%20Wade%20%28English%20politician%29">Sir William Waad</a>, Lieutenant of the Tower, supervised the torture and obtained Fawkes's confession. He searched his prisoner, and found a letter addressed to Guy Fawkes. To Waad's surprise, "Johnson" remained silent, revealing nothing about the plot or its authors. On the night of 6 November he spoke with Waad, who reported to Salisbury "He [Johnson] told us that since he undertook this action he did every day pray to God he might perform that which might be for the advancement of the Catholic Faith and saving his own soul". According to Waad, Fawkes managed to rest through the night, despite his being warned that he would be interrogated until "I had gotton the inwards secret of his thoughts and all his complices". His composure was broken at some point during the following day.

The observer Sir Edward Hoby remarked "Since Johnson's being in the Tower, he beginneth to speak English". Fawkes revealed his true identity on 7 November, and told his interrogators that there were five people involved in the plot to kill the King. He began to reveal their names on 8 November, and told how they intended to place Princess Elizabeth on the throne. His third confession, on 9 November, implicated <a href="Francis%20Tresham">Francis Tresham</a>. Following the <a href="Ridolfi%20plot">Ridolfi plot</a> of 1571 prisoners were made to dictate their confessions, before copying and signing them, if they still could. Although it is uncertain if he was tortured on the rack, Fawkes's scrawled signature bears testament to the suffering he endured at the hands of his interrogators.

The trial of eight of the plotters began on Monday 27 January 1606. Fawkes shared the barge from the Tower to <a href="Westminster%20Hall">Westminster Hall</a> with seven of his co-conspirators. They were kept in the <a href="Star%20Chamber">Star Chamber</a> before being taken to Westminster Hall, where they were displayed on a purpose-built scaffold. The King and his close family, watching in secret, were among the spectators as the Lords Commissioners read out the list of charges. Fawkes was identified as Guido Fawkes, "otherwise called Guido Johnson". He pleaded not guilty, despite his apparent acceptance of guilt from the moment he was captured.
The jury found all the defendants guilty, and the <a href="Lord%20Chief%20Justice%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Lord Chief Justice</a> Sir <a href="John%20Popham%20%28judge%29">John Popham</a> pronounced them guilty of <a href="high%20treason">high treason</a>. The <a href="Attorney%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Attorney General</a> <a href="Edward%20Coke">Sir Edward Coke</a> told the court that each of the condemned would be <a href="Hanged%2C%20drawn%2C%20and%20quartered">drawn backwards</a> to his death, by a horse, his head near the ground. They were to be "put to death halfway between heaven and earth as unworthy of both". Their genitals would be cut off and burnt before their eyes, and their bowels and hearts removed. They would then be decapitated, and the dismembered parts of their bodies displayed so that they might become "prey for the fowls of the air". Fawkes's and Tresham's testimony regarding the Spanish treason was read aloud, as well as confessions related specifically to the Gunpowder Plot. The last piece of evidence offered was a conversation between Fawkes and Wintour, who had been kept in adjacent cells. The two men apparently thought they had been speaking in private, but their conversation was intercepted by a government spy. When the prisoners were allowed to speak, Fawkes explained his not guilty plea as ignorance of certain aspects of the indictment.

On 31 January 1606, Fawkes and three others – Thomas Wintour, <a href="Ambrose%20Rookwood">Ambrose Rookwood</a>, and Robert Keyes – were dragged ("i.e.", "drawn") from the Tower on wattled <a href="hurdle">hurdle</a>s to the Old Palace Yard at Westminster, opposite the building they had attempted to destroy. His fellow plotters were then hanged and quartered. Fawkes was the last to stand on the scaffold. He asked for forgiveness of the King and state, while keeping up his "crosses and idle ceremonies" (Catholic practices). Weakened by torture and aided by the hangman, Fawkes began to climb the ladder to the noose, but either through jumping to his death or climbing too high so the rope was incorrectly set, he managed to avoid the agony of the latter part of his execution by breaking his neck. His lifeless body was nevertheless quartered and, as was the custom, his body parts were then distributed to "the four corners of the kingdom", to be displayed as a warning to other would-be traitors.

On 5 November 1605, Londoners were encouraged to celebrate the King's escape from assassination by lighting bonfires, provided that "this testemonye of joy be carefull done without any danger or disorder". <a href="Observance%20of%205th%20November%20Act%201605">An Act of Parliament</a> designated each 5 November as a day of thanksgiving for "the joyful day of deliverance", and remained in force until 1859. Fawkes was one of 13 conspirators, but he is the individual most associated with the plot.

In Britain, 5 November has variously been called <a href="Guy%20Fawkes%20Night">Guy Fawkes Night</a>, Guy Fawkes Day, Plot Night, and Bonfire Night (which can be traced directly back to the original celebration of 5 November 1605). Bonfires were accompanied by fireworks from the 1650s onwards, and it became the custom after 1673 to burn an effigy (usually of the pope) when heir presumptive <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James, Duke of York</a> converted to Catholicism. Effigies of other notable figures have found their way onto the bonfires, such as <a href="Paul%20Kruger">Paul Kruger</a> and <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, although most modern effigies are of Fawkes. The "guy" is normally created by children from old clothes, newspapers, and a mask. During the 19th century, "guy" came to mean an oddly dressed person, but in American English it has lost any pejorative connotation and is used to refer to any male person.

James Sharpe, professor of history at the University of York, has described how Guy Fawkes came to be toasted as "the last man to enter Parliament with honest intentions". <a href="William%20Harrison%20Ainsworth">William Harrison Ainsworth</a>'s 1841 historical romance "<a href="Guy%20Fawkes%20%28novel%29">Guy Fawkes; or, The Gunpowder Treason</a>" portrays Fawkes in a generally sympathetic light, and his novel transformed Fawkes in the public perception into an "acceptable fictional character". Fawkes subsequently appeared as "essentially an action hero" in children's books and <a href="penny%20dreadful">penny dreadful</a>s such as "The Boyhood Days of Guy Fawkes; or, The Conspirators of Old London", published around 1905. According to historian <a href="Lewis%20Call">Lewis Call</a>, Fawkes is now "a major icon in modern political culture" whose face has become "a potentially powerful instrument for the articulation of postmodern anarchism" in the late 20th century.

Taxonomic classifications of one to eight extant giraffe species have been described, based upon research into the <a href="Mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial</a> and <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear DNA</a>, as well as morphological measurements of "Giraffa," but the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> currently recognises only one species, "Giraffa camelopardalis", the <a href="type%20species">type species</a>, with nine subspecies. Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric species known from fossils. 

The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like <a href="ossicone">ossicone</a>s, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified under the <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Giraffidae">Giraffidae</a>, along with its closest extant relative, the <a href="okapi">okapi</a>. Its scattered range extends from <a href="Chad">Chad</a> in the north to <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> in the south, and from <a href="Niger">Niger</a> in the west to <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a> in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit <a href="savannah">savannah</a>s and <a href="woodland">woodland</a>s. Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily <a href="Acacieae">acacia</a> species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. They may be preyed on by <a href="lion">lion</a>s, <a href="leopard">leopard</a>s, <a href="spotted%20hyena">spotted hyena</a>s and <a href="African%20wild%20dog">African wild dog</a>s. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. <a href="dominance%20%28ethology%29">Dominant</a> males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.

The giraffe has intrigued various cultures, both ancient and modern, for its peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> as <a href="Vulnerable%20species">Vulnerable</a> to extinction, and has been <a href="Local%20extinction">extirpated</a> from many parts of its former range. Giraffes are still found in numerous <a href="national%20park">national park</a>s and <a href="game%20reserve">game reserve</a>s but estimations as of 2016 indicate that there are approximately 97,500 members of "Giraffa" in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.

The name "giraffe" has its earliest known origins in the <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> word (), perhaps borrowed from the animal's <a href="Somali%20language">Somali</a> name . The Arab name is translated as "fast-walker". There were several <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> spellings, such as , , and . The <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a> form arose in the 1590s. The modern English form developed around 1600 from the <a href="French%20language">French</a> . "Camelopard" is an archaic English name for the giraffe deriving from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> for camel and leopard, referring to its <a href="camel">camel</a>-like shape and its <a href="leopard">leopard</a>-like colouring.

Living giraffes were originally classified as one species by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in 1758. He gave it the binomial name "<a href="Cervus">Cervus</a> camelopardalis". <a href="Morten%20Thrane%20Br%C3%BCnnich">Morten Thrane Brünnich</a> classified the genus "Giraffa" in 1772. The species name "camelopardalis" is from <a href="Latin">Latin</a>.

The giraffe is one of only two living genera of the family <a href="Giraffidae">Giraffidae</a> in the order <a href="Artiodactyla">Artiodactyla</a>, the other being the <a href="okapi">okapi</a>. The family was once much more extensive, with over 10 fossil <a href="Genus">genera</a> described. Their closest known relatives are the extinct deer-like <a href="Climacoceratidae">climacocerids</a>. They, together with the family <a href="Antilocapridae">Antilocapridae</a> (whose only extant species is the <a href="pronghorn">pronghorn</a>), belong to the superfamily <a href="Giraffoidea">Giraffoidea</a>. These animals may have evolved from the extinct family <a href="Palaeomerycidae">Palaeomerycidae</a> which might also have been the ancestor of <a href="deer">deer</a>.

The elongation of the neck appears to have started early in the giraffe <a href="Lineage%20%28evolution%29">lineage</a>. Comparisons between giraffes and their ancient relatives suggest that vertebrae close to the skull lengthened earlier, followed by lengthening of vertebrae further down. One early giraffid ancestor was "<a href="Canthumeryx">Canthumeryx</a>" which has been dated variously to have lived 25–20 million years ago (mya), 17–15 mya or 18–14.3 mya and whose deposits have been found in Libya. This animal was medium-sized, slender and antelope-like. "<a href="Giraffokeryx">Giraffokeryx</a>" appeared 15 mya in the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> and resembled an okapi or a small giraffe, and had a longer neck and similar <a href="ossicones">ossicones</a>. "Giraffokeryx" may have shared a clade with more massively built giraffids like "<a href="Sivatherium">Sivatherium</a>" and "<a href="Bramatherium">Bramatherium</a>".

Giraffids like "<a href="Palaeotragus">Palaeotragus</a>", "<a href="Shansitherium">Shansitherium</a>" and "<a href="Samotherium">Samotherium</a>" appeared 14 mya and lived throughout Africa and Eurasia. These animals had bare ossicones and small cranial sinuses and were longer with broader skulls. "Paleotragus" resembled the okapi and may have been its ancestor. Others find that the okapi lineage diverged earlier, before "Giraffokeryx". "Samotherium" was a particularly important <a href="transitional%20fossil">transitional fossil</a> in the giraffe lineage as its cervical vertebrae was intermediate in length and structure between a modern giraffe and an okapi, and was more vertical than the okapi's. "<a href="Bohlinia">Bohlinia</a>", which first appeared in southeastern Europe and lived 9–7 mya was likely a direct ancestor of the giraffe. "Bohlinia" closely resembled modern giraffes, having a long neck and legs and similar ossicones and dentition.

"Bohlinia" entered China and northern India in response to climate change. From there, the genus "<a href="Giraffa">Giraffa</a>" evolved and, around 7 mya, entered Africa. Further climate changes caused the extinction of the Asian giraffes, while the African giraffes survived and radiated into several new species. Living giraffes appear to have arisen around 1 mya in eastern Africa during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>. Some biologists suggest the modern giraffes descended from "<a href="Giraffa%20jumae">G. jumae</a>"; others find "<a href="Giraffa%20gracilis">G. gracilis</a>" a more likely candidate. "G. jumae" was larger and more heavily built while "G. gracilis" was smaller and more lightly built. The main driver for the evolution of the giraffes is believed to have been the changes from extensive forests to more open habitats, which began 8 mya. During this time, tropical plants disappeared and were replaced by arid <a href="C4%20plant">C4 plant</a>s, and a dry savannah emerged across eastern and northern Africa and western India. Some researchers have hypothesised that this new habitat coupled with a different diet, including acacia species, may have exposed giraffe ancestors to toxins that caused higher mutation rates and a higher rate of evolution. The coat patterns of modern giraffes may also have coincided with these habitat changes. Asian giraffes are hypothesised to have had more okapi-like colourations.

In the early 19th century, <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lamarck">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</a> believed the giraffe's long neck was an "acquired characteristic", developed as generations of ancestral giraffes strove to reach the leaves of tall trees. This theory was eventually rejected, and scientists now believe the giraffe's neck arose through Darwinian <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a>—that ancestral giraffes with long necks thereby had a competitive feeding advantage (competing browsers hypothesis) that better enabled them to survive and reproduce to pass on their genes.

The giraffe <a href="genome">genome</a> is around 2.9 billion <a href="base%20pair">base pair</a>s in length compared to the 3.3 billion base pairs of the okapi. Of the proteins in giraffe and okapi genes, 19.4% are identical. The two species are equally distantly related to cattle, suggesting the giraffe's unique characteristics are not because of faster evolution. The <a href="Divergent%20evolution">divergence</a> of giraffe and okapi lineages dates to around 11.5 mya. A small group of <a href="regulatory%20gene">regulatory gene</a>s in the giraffe appear to be responsible for the animal's stature and associated circulatory adaptations.

The IUCN currently recognises only one species of giraffe with nine subspecies. In 2001, a two-species taxonomy was proposed. A 2007 study on the genetics of "Giraffa", suggested they were six species: the West African, Rothschild's, reticulated, Masai, Angolan, and South African giraffe. The study deduced from genetic differences in <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear</a> and <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> (mtDNA) that giraffes from these populations are <a href="Reproductive%20isolation">reproductively isolated</a> and rarely interbreed, though no natural obstacles block their mutual access. This includes adjacent populations of Rothschild's, reticulated, and Masai giraffes. The Masai giraffe was also suggested to consist of possibly two species separated by the <a href="East%20African%20Rift">Rift Valley</a>.

Reticulated and Masai giraffes have the highest mtDNA diversity, which is consistent with giraffes originating in eastern Africa. Populations further north are more closely related to the former, while those to the south are more related to the latter. Giraffes appear to select mates of the same coat type, which are <a href="Imprinting%20%28psychology%29">imprinted</a> on them as calves. The implications of these findings for the conservation of giraffes were summarised by David Brown, lead author of the study, who stated: "Lumping all giraffes into one species obscures the reality that some kinds of giraffe are on the brink. Some of these populations number only a few hundred individuals and need immediate protection."

A 2011 study using detailed analyses of the morphology of giraffes, and application of the <a href="Species">phylogenetic species concept</a>, described eight species of living giraffes. The eight species are: "<a href="Angolan%20giraffe">G. angolensis</a>", "<a href="Kordofan%20giraffe">G. antiquorum</a>", "<a href="Nubian%20giraffe">G. camelopardalis</a>", "<a href="South%20African%20giraffe">G. giraffa</a>", "<a href="West%20African%20giraffe">G. peralta</a>", "<a href="Reticulated%20giraffe">G. reticulata</a>", "<a href="Rhodesian%20giraffe">G. thornicrofti</a>", and "<a href="Masai%20giraffe">G. tippelskirchi</a>".

A 2016 study also concluded that living giraffes consist of multiple species. The researchers suggested the existence of four species, which have not exchanged genetic information between each other for 1 million to 2 million years. Those four species are the <a href="northern%20giraffe">northern giraffe</a> ("G. camelopardalis"), <a href="southern%20giraffe">southern giraffe</a> ("G. giraffa"), <a href="reticulated%20giraffe">reticulated giraffe</a> ("G. reticulata"), and <a href="Masai%20giraffe">Masai giraffe</a> ("G. tippelskirchi"). Since then, a response to this publication has been published, highlighting seven problems in data interpretation, and concludes "the conclusions should not be accepted unconditionally".

In 2016 there were an estimated 90,000 individuals of "Giraffa" in the wild. In 2010 there were more than 1,600 in captivity at <a href="Species360">Species360</a>-registered zoos (not including non-Species360 zoos or any kept by private people).

There are also seven extinct species of giraffe, listed as the following: 
"G. attica", also extinct, was formerly considered part of "Giraffa" but was reclassified as "<a href="Bohlinia">Bohlinia attica</a>" in 1929.

Fully grown giraffes stand tall, with males taller than females. The tallest recorded male was and the tallest recorded female was tall. The average weight is for an adult male and for an adult female with maximum weights of and having been recorded for males and females, respectively. Despite its long neck and legs, the giraffe's body is relatively short. Located at both sides of the head, the giraffe's large, bulging eyes give it good all-round vision from its great height. Giraffes see in colour and their senses of hearing and <a href="olfaction">smell</a> are also sharp. The animal can close its muscular nostrils to protect against sandstorms and ants. 
The giraffe's <a href="prehensile">prehensile</a> tongue is about long. It is purplish-black in colour, perhaps to protect against sunburn, and is useful for grasping foliage, as well as for grooming and cleaning the animal's nose. The upper lip of the giraffe is also prehensile and useful when foraging and is covered in hair to protect against thorns. The tongue, and inside of the mouth are covered in <a href="Taste%20bud">papillae</a>.
The coat has dark blotches or patches (which can be orange, <a href="Chestnut%20%28color%29">chestnut</a>, brown, or nearly black in colour) separated by light hair (usually white or <a href="Cream%20%28colour%29">cream</a> in colour). Male giraffes become darker as they age. The coat pattern has been claimed to serve as <a href="camouflage">camouflage</a> in the light and shade patterns of savannah woodlands. Giraffe calves inherit some spot pattern traits from their mothers, and variation in some spot traits are correlated with neonatal survival. The skin underneath the dark areas may serve as windows for <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a>, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands. Each individual giraffe has a unique coat pattern.

The skin of a giraffe is mostly gray. Its thickness allows the animal to run through thorn bushes without being punctured. The fur may serve as a chemical defence, as its parasite repellents give the animal a characteristic scent. At least 11 main <a href="aromaticity">aromatic</a> chemicals are in the fur, although <a href="indole">indole</a> and <a href="3-methylindole">3-methylindole</a> are responsible for most of the smell. Because the males have a stronger odour than the females, the odour may also have sexual function. Along the animal's neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The one-metre (3.3-ft) tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.

Both sexes have prominent horn-like structures called <a href="ossicone">ossicone</a>s, which are formed from ossified cartilage, covered in skin and fused to the skull at the <a href="parietal%20bone">parietal bone</a>s. Being <a href="vascular">vascular</a>ized, the ossicones may have a role in thermoregulation, and are also used in combat between males. Appearance is a reliable guide to the sex or age of a giraffe: the ossicones of females and young are thin and display tufts of hair on top, whereas those of adult males end in knobs and tend to be bald on top. Also, a median lump, which is more prominent in males, emerges at the front of the <a href="skull">skull</a>. Males develop <a href="calcium">calcium</a> deposits that form bumps on their skulls as they age. A giraffe's skull is lightened by multiple <a href="Sinus%20%28anatomy%29">sinuses</a>. However, as males age, their skulls become heavier and more club-like, helping them become more dominant in combat. The upper jaw has a grooved <a href="palate">palate</a> and lacks front teeth. The giraffe's <a href="Molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a>s have a rough surface.

The front and back legs of a giraffe are about the same length. The <a href="Radius%20%28bone%29">radius</a> and <a href="ulna">ulna</a> of the front legs are articulated by the <a href="carpus">carpus</a>, which, while structurally equivalent to the human wrist, functions as a knee. It appears that a <a href="suspensory%20ligament">suspensory ligament</a> allows the lanky legs to support the animal's great weight. The foot of the giraffe reaches a diameter of , and the <a href="hoof">hoof</a> is high in males and in females. The rear of each hoof is low and the <a href="fetlock">fetlock</a> is close to the ground, allowing the foot to provide additional support to the animal's weight. Giraffes lack <a href="dewclaw">dewclaw</a>s and interdigital glands. The giraffe's pelvis, though relatively short, has an <a href="Ilium%20%28bone%29">ilium</a> that is outspread at the upper ends.

A giraffe has only two <a href="gait">gait</a>s: walking and galloping. Walking is done by moving the legs on one side of the body at the same time, then doing the same on the other side. When galloping, the hind legs move around the front legs before the latter move forward, and the tail will curl up. The animal relies on the forward and backward motions of its head and neck to maintain balance and the counter momentum while galloping. The giraffe can reach a sprint speed of up to , and can sustain for several kilometres.
A giraffe rests by lying with its body on top of its folded legs. To lie down, the animal kneels on its front legs and then lowers the rest of its body. To get back up, it first gets on its knees and spreads its hind legs to raise its hindquarters. It then straightens its front legs. With each step, the animal swings its head. In captivity, the giraffe sleeps intermittently around 4.6 hours per day, mostly at night. It usually sleeps lying down, however, standing sleeps have been recorded, particularly in older individuals. Intermittent short "deep sleep" phases while lying are characterised by the giraffe bending its neck backwards and resting its head on the hip or thigh, a position believed to indicate <a href="paradoxical%20sleep">paradoxical sleep</a>. If the giraffe wants to bend down to drink, it either spreads its front legs or bends its knees. Giraffes would probably not be competent swimmers as their long legs would be highly cumbersome in the water, although they could possibly float. When swimming, the thorax would be weighed down by the front legs, making it difficult for the animal to move its neck and legs in harmony or keep its head above the surface.

The giraffe has an extremely elongated neck, which can be up to in length, accounting for much of the animal's vertical height. The long neck results from a disproportionate lengthening of the <a href="cervical%20vertebrae">cervical vertebrae</a>, not from the addition of more vertebrae. Each cervical vertebra is over long. They comprise 52–54 per cent of the length of the giraffe's <a href="vertebral%20column">vertebral column</a>, compared with the 27–33 percent typical of similar large ungulates, including the giraffe's closest living relative, the <a href="okapi">okapi</a>. This elongation largely takes place after birth, perhaps because giraffe mothers would have a difficult time giving birth to young with the same neck proportions as adults. The giraffe's head and neck are held up by large muscles and a strengthened <a href="nuchal%20ligament">nuchal ligament</a>, which are anchored by long dorsal spines on the anterior <a href="thoracic%20vertebrae">thoracic vertebrae</a>, giving the animal a hump.
The giraffe's neck vertebrae have <a href="ball%20and%20socket%20joint">ball and socket joint</a>s. In particular, the <a href="Atlas%20%28anatomy%29">atlas</a>–<a href="Axis%20%28anatomy%29">axis</a> joint (C1 and C2) allows the animal to tilt its head vertically and reach more branches with the tongue. The point of articulation between the cervical and thoracic vertebrae of giraffes is shifted to lie between the first and second thoracic vertebrae (T1 and T2), unlike most other ruminants where the articulation is between the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) and T1. This allows C7 to contribute directly to increased neck length and has given rise to the suggestion that T1 is actually C8, and that giraffes have added an extra cervical vertebra. However, this proposition is not generally accepted, as T1 has other morphological features, such as an articulating <a href="rib">rib</a>, deemed diagnostic of thoracic vertebrae, and because exceptions to the mammalian limit of seven cervical vertebrae are generally characterised by increased <a href="neurological%20disorder">neurological anomalies</a> and maladies.

There are several hypotheses regarding the evolutionary origin and maintenance of elongation in giraffe necks. The "competing <a href="browsing%20%28predation%29">browsers</a> hypothesis" was originally suggested by <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> and challenged only recently. It suggests that competitive pressure from smaller browsers, such as <a href="kudu">kudu</a>, <a href="steenbok">steenbok</a> and <a href="impala">impala</a>, encouraged the elongation of the neck, as it enabled giraffes to reach food that competitors could not. This advantage is real, as giraffes can and do feed up to high, while even quite large competitors, such as kudu, can feed up to only about high. There is also research suggesting that browsing competition is intense at lower levels, and giraffes feed more efficiently (gaining more leaf biomass with each mouthful) high in the canopy. However, scientists disagree about just how much time giraffes spend feeding at levels beyond the reach of other browsers,
and a 2010 study found that adult giraffes with longer necks actually suffered higher mortality rates under drought conditions than their shorter-necked counterparts. This study suggests that maintaining a longer neck requires more nutrients, which puts longer-necked giraffes at risk during a food shortage.

Another theory, the <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a> hypothesis, proposes that the long necks evolved as a secondary <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual characteristic</a>, giving males an advantage in "necking" contests (see below) to establish dominance and obtain access to sexually receptive females. In support of this theory, necks are longer and heavier for males than females of the same age, and the former do not employ other forms of combat. However, one objection is that it fails to explain why female giraffes also have long necks. It has also been proposed that the neck serves to give the animal greater vigilance.

In mammals, the left <a href="recurrent%20laryngeal%20nerve">recurrent laryngeal nerve</a> is longer than the right; in the giraffe it is over longer. These nerves are longer in the giraffe than in any other living animal; the left nerve is over long. Each nerve cell in this path begins in the <a href="brainstem">brainstem</a> and passes down the neck along the <a href="vagus%20nerve">vagus nerve</a>, then branches off into the recurrent laryngeal nerve which passes back up the neck to the larynx. Thus, these nerve cells have a length of nearly in the largest giraffes. The structure of a giraffe's brain resembles that of domestic cattle. It is kept cool by evaporative heat loss in the nasal passages. The shape of the skeleton gives the giraffe a small lung volume relative to its mass. Its long neck gives it a large amount of <a href="Dead%20space%20%28physiology%29">dead space</a>, in spite of its narrow windpipe. These factors increase the resistance to airflow. Nevertheless, the animal can still supply enough oxygen to its tissues and it can increase its respiratory rate and oxygen diffusion when running.

The <a href="circulatory%20system">circulatory system</a> of the giraffe has several adaptations for its great height. Its heart, which can weigh more than and measures about long, must generate approximately double the blood pressure required for a human to maintain blood flow to the brain. As such, the wall of the heart can be as thick as . Giraffes have unusually high heart rates for their size, at 150 beats per minute. When the animal lowers its head the blood rushes down fairly unopposed and a <a href="rete%20mirabile">rete mirabile</a> in the upper neck, with its large <a href="Cross%20section%20%28geometry%29">cross sectional</a> area, prevents excess blood flow to the brain. When it raises again, the blood vessels constrict and direct blood into the brain so the animal does not faint. The <a href="jugular%20vein">jugular vein</a>s contain several (most commonly seven) valves to prevent blood flowing back into the head from the <a href="inferior%20vena%20cava">inferior vena cava</a> and <a href="right%20atrium">right atrium</a> while the head is lowered. Conversely, the blood vessels in the lower legs are under great pressure because of the weight of fluid pressing down on them. To solve this problem, the skin of the lower legs is thick and tight; preventing too much blood from pouring into them.

Giraffes have <a href="Esophagus">oesophageal muscles</a> that are unusually strong to allow regurgitation of food from the stomach up the neck and into the mouth for <a href="wikt%3Aruminate">rumination</a>. They have four chambered stomachs, as in all ruminants, and the first chamber has adapted to their specialised diet. The intestines of an adult giraffe measure more than in length and have a relatively small ratio of small to large intestine. The liver of the giraffe is small and compact. A gallbladder is generally present during fetal life, but it may disappear before birth.

Giraffes usually inhabit <a href="savannah">savannah</a>s and open <a href="woodland">woodland</a>s. They prefer <a href="Acacieae">Acacieae</a>, "<a href="Commiphora">Commiphora</a>", "<a href="Combretum">Combretum</a>" and open "<a href="Terminalia%20%28plant%29">Terminalia</a>" woodlands over denser environments like "<a href="Brachystegia">Brachystegia</a>" woodlands. The Angolan giraffe can be found in desert environments. Giraffes browse on the twigs of trees, preferring trees of the subfamily Acacieae and the genera "Commiphora" and "Terminalia", which are important sources of calcium and protein to sustain the giraffe's growth rate. They also feed on shrubs, grass and fruit. A giraffe eats around of foliage daily. When stressed, giraffes may chew the bark off branches. Although <a href="herbivorous">herbivorous</a>, the giraffe has been known to visit carcasses and lick dried meat off bones.

During the wet season, food is abundant and giraffes are more spread out, while during the dry season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably to make it easier to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a <a href="ruminant">ruminant</a>, the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again. It is common for a giraffe to salivate while feeding. The giraffe requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. The animal's faeces come in the form of small pellets. When it has access to water, a giraffe drinks at intervals no longer than three days.

Giraffes have a great effect on the trees that they feed on, delaying the growth of young trees for some years and giving "waistlines" to trees that are too tall. Feeding is at its highest during the first and last hours of daytime. Between these hours, giraffes mostly stand and ruminate. Rumination is the dominant activity during the night, when it is mostly done lying down.

Giraffes are usually found in groups. Traditionally, the composition of these groups has been described as open and ever-changing. Giraffes were thought to have few social bonds and for research purposes, a "group" has been defined as "a collection of individuals that are less than a kilometre apart and moving in the same general direction." More recent studies have found that giraffes do have long-term social associations and may form groups or pairs based on kinship, sex or other factors. These groups may regularly associate with one another in larger communities or sub-communities within a <a href="fission%E2%80%93fusion%20society">fission–fusion society</a>. The number of giraffes in a group can range up to 44 individuals. 

Giraffe groups tend to be sex-segregated although mixed-sex groups made of adult females and young males are known to occur. Particularly stable giraffe groups are those made of mothers and their young, which can last weeks or months. Social cohesion in these groups is maintained by the bonds formed between calves. Female association appears to be based on <a href="Philopatry">space-use</a> and individuals may be <a href="matrilineally">matrilineally</a> related. In general, females are more selective than males in who they associate with in regards to individuals of the same sex. Young males also form groups and will engage in playfights. However, as they get older males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups. Giraffes are not <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a>, but they have <a href="home%20range">home range</a>s that vary according to rainfall and proximity to human settlements. Male giraffes occasionally wander far from areas that they normally frequent.

Although generally quiet and non-vocal, giraffes have been heard to communicate using various sounds. During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit snorts, bleats, mooing and mewing sounds. Giraffes also snore, hiss, moan, grunt and make flute-like sounds, and possibly communicate over long distances using <a href="infrasound">infrasound</a>—though this is disputed. During nighttime, giraffes appear to <a href="humming">hum</a> to each other above the infrasound range for purposes which are unclear.

Reproduction in giraffes is broadly <a href="polygamous">polygamous</a>: a few older males mate with the fertile females. Male giraffes assess female fertility by tasting the female's urine to detect <a href="oestrus">oestrus</a>, in a multi-step process known as the <a href="flehmen%20response">flehmen response</a>. Males prefer young adult females over juveniles and older adults. Once an oestrous female is detected, the male will attempt to court her. When courting, dominant males will keep subordinate ones at bay. A courting male may lick a female's tail, rest his head and neck on her body or nudge her with his horns. During copulation, the male stands on his hind legs with his head held up and his front legs resting on the female's sides.

Giraffe <a href="gestation">gestation</a> lasts 400–460 days, after which a single calf is normally born, although twins occur on rare occasions. The mother gives birth standing up. The calf emerges head and front legs first, having broken through the <a href="fetal%20membrane">fetal membrane</a>s, and falls to the ground, severing the <a href="umbilical%20cord">umbilical cord</a>. The mother then grooms the newborn and helps it stand up. A newborn giraffe is tall. Within a few hours of birth, the calf can run around and is almost indistinguishable from a one-week-old. However, for the first 1–3 weeks, it spends most of its time hiding; its coat pattern providing camouflage. The ossicones, which have lain flat while it was in the womb, become erect within a few days.

Mothers with calves will gather in nursery herds, moving or browsing together. Mothers in such a group may sometimes leave their calves with one female while they forage and drink elsewhere. This is known as a "<a href="Cr%C3%A8che%20%28zoology%29">calving pool</a>". Adult males play almost no role in raising the young, although they appear to have friendly interactions. Calves are at risk of predation, and a mother giraffe will stand over her calf and kick at an approaching predator. Females watching calving pools will only alert their own young if they detect a disturbance, although the others will take notice and follow.

The length time in which offspring stay with their mother varies, though it can last until the female's next calving. Likewise, calves may suckle for only a month or as long as a year. Females become sexually mature when they are four years old, while males become mature at four or five years. <a href="Spermatogenesis">Spermatogenesis</a> in male giraffes begins at three to four years of age. Males must wait until they are at least seven years old to gain the opportunity to mate.

Male giraffes use their necks as weapons in combat, a behaviour known as "necking". Necking is used to establish dominance and males that win necking bouts have greater <a href="reproductive%20success">reproductive success</a>. This behaviour occurs at low or high intensity. In low intensity necking, the combatants rub and lean against each other. The male that can hold itself more erect wins the bout. In high intensity necking, the combatants will spread their front legs and swing their necks at each other, attempting to land blows with their ossicones. The contestants will try to dodge each other's blows and then get ready to counter. The power of a blow depends on the weight of the skull and the arc of the swing. A necking duel can last more than half an hour, depending on how well matched the combatants are. Although most fights do not lead to serious injury, there have been records of broken jaws, broken necks, and even deaths.

After a duel, it is common for two male giraffes to caress and court each other. Such interactions between males have been found to be more frequent than heterosexual coupling. In one study, up to 94 percent of observed mounting incidents took place between males. The proportion of same-sex activities varied from 30–75 percent. Only one percent of same-sex mounting incidents occurred between females.

Giraffes have high adult survival probability, and an unusually long lifespan compared to other ruminants, up to 25 years in the wild. Because of their size, eyesight and powerful kicks, adult giraffes are usually not subject to predation, aside from <a href="lion">lion</a>s. Giraffes are the most common prey for the big cats in <a href="Kruger%20National%20Park">Kruger National Park</a>. <a href="Nile%20crocodile">Nile crocodile</a>s can also be a threat to giraffes when they bend down to drink. Calves are much more vulnerable than adults, and are additionally preyed on by <a href="leopard">leopard</a>s, <a href="spotted%20hyena">spotted hyena</a>s and <a href="African%20wild%20dog">wild dogs</a>. A quarter to a half of giraffe calves reach adulthood. Calf survival varies according to the season of birth, with calves born during the dry season having higher survival rates. The local, seasonal presence of large herds of migratory <a href="wildebeest">wildebeest</a>s and <a href="zebra">zebra</a>s reduces predation pressure on giraffe calves and increases their survival probability.

Some parasites feed on giraffes. They are often hosts for <a href="tick">tick</a>s, especially in the area around the genitals, which has thinner skin than other areas. Tick species that commonly feed on giraffes are those of genera "<a href="Hyalomma">Hyalomma</a>", "<a href="Amblyomma">Amblyomma</a>" and "<a href="Rhipicephalus">Rhipicephalus</a>". Giraffes may rely on <a href="Red-billed%20Oxpecker">red-billed</a> and <a href="yellow-billed%20oxpecker">yellow-billed oxpecker</a>s to clean them of ticks and alert them to danger. Giraffes host numerous species of internal parasite and are susceptible to various diseases. They were victims of the (now eradicated) viral illness <a href="rinderpest">rinderpest</a>. Giraffes can also suffer from a skin disorder, which comes in the form of wrinkles, <a href="Cutaneous%20condition%23Lesions">lesions</a> or raw <a href="skin%20fissure">fissures</a>. In Tanzania, it appears to be caused by a <a href="nematode">nematode</a>, and may be further affected by secondary infections. As much as 79% of giraffes show signs of the disease in <a href="Ruaha%20National%20Park">Ruaha National Park</a>, but it is less prevalent in areas with fertile soils.

Humans have interacted with giraffes for millennia. The <a href="San%20people">San people</a> of southern Africa have medicine dances named after some animals; the giraffe dance is performed to treat head ailments. How the giraffe got its height has been the subject of various African <a href="Folklore">folktales</a>, including one from eastern Africa which explains that the giraffe grew tall from eating too many magic herbs. Giraffes were depicted in art throughout the African continent, including that of the <a href="Kiffian%20culture">Kiffians</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egyptians</a> and <a href="Kushites">Kushites</a>. The Kiffians were responsible for a life-size rock engraving of two giraffes that has been called the "world's largest rock art petroglyph". The Egyptians gave the giraffe its own <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">hieroglyph</a>, named 'sr' in <a href="Old%20Egyptian%20language">Old Egyptian</a> and 'mmy' in later periods. They also kept giraffes as pets and shipped them around the Mediterranean.

The giraffe was also known to the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greeks</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a>, who believed that it was an unnatural hybrid of a <a href="camel">camel</a> and a leopard and called it "camelopardalis". The giraffe was among the many animals collected and <a href="Mosaic%20Fragment%20with%20Man%20Leading%20a%20Giraffe%20%28Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago%29">displayed</a> by the Romans. The first one in Rome was brought in by <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> in 46 BC and exhibited to the public. With the <a href="fall%20of%20the%20Western%20Roman%20Empire">fall of the Western Roman Empire</a>, the housing of giraffes in Europe declined. During the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, giraffes were known to Europeans through contact with the Arabs, who revered the giraffe for its peculiar appearance.

Individual captive giraffes were given celebrity status throughout history. In 1414, a giraffe was shipped from <a href="Malindi">Malindi</a> to <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a>. It was then <a href="Treasure%20voyages">taken to China</a> by explorer <a href="Zheng%20He">Zheng He</a> and placed in a <a href="Ming%20dynasty">Ming dynasty</a> zoo. The animal was a source of fascination for the Chinese people, who associated it with the mythical <a href="Qilin">Qilin</a>. The <a href="Medici%20giraffe">Medici giraffe</a> was a giraffe presented to <a href="Lorenzo%20de%27%20Medici">Lorenzo de' Medici</a> in 1486. It caused a great stir on its arrival in <a href="Florence">Florence</a>. <a href="Zarafa%20%28giraffe%29">Zarafa</a>, another famous giraffe, was brought from <a href="History%20of%20Egypt%20under%20the%20Muhammad%20Ali%20dynasty">Egypt</a> to Paris in the early 19th century as a gift from <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20of%20Egypt">Muhammad Ali of Egypt</a> to <a href="Charles%20X%20of%20France">Charles X of France</a>. A sensation, the giraffe was the subject of numerous memorabilia or "giraffanalia".

Giraffes continue to have a presence in modern culture. <a href="Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a> depicted them with burning manes in some of his surrealist paintings. Dali considered the giraffe to be a symbol of masculinity, and a flaming giraffe was meant to be a "masculine cosmic apocalyptic monster". Several children's books feature the giraffe, including David A. Ufer's "The Giraffe Who Was Afraid of Heights", <a href="Giles%20Andreae">Giles Andreae</a>'s "Giraffes Can't Dance" and <a href="Roald%20Dahl">Roald Dahl</a>'s "<a href="The%20Giraffe%20and%20the%20Pelly%20and%20Me">The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me</a>". Giraffes have appeared in animated films, as minor characters in <a href="Disney">Disney</a>'s "<a href="The%20Lion%20King">The Lion King</a>" and "<a href="Dumbo">Dumbo</a>", and in more prominent roles in "<a href="The%20Wild">The Wild</a>" and in the "<a href="Madagascar%20%28franchise%29">Madagascar</a>" films. <a href="Sophie%20the%20Giraffe">Sophie the Giraffe</a> has been a popular <a href="teether">teether</a> since 1961. Another famous fictional giraffe is the Toys "R" Us mascot <a href="Toys%20%26quot%3BR%26quot%3B%20Us%23Geoffrey%20the%20Giraffe">Geoffrey the Giraffe</a>.

The giraffe has also been used for some scientific experiments and discoveries. Scientists have looked at the properties of giraffe skin when developing suits for <a href="astronaut">astronaut</a>s and <a href="fighter%20pilot">fighter pilot</a>s because the people in these professions are in danger of passing out if blood rushes to their legs. Computer scientists have modeled the coat patterns of several subspecies using <a href="reaction%E2%80%93diffusion">reaction–diffusion</a> mechanisms.

The <a href="constellation">constellation</a> of <a href="Camelopardalis">Camelopardalis</a>, introduced in the seventeenth century, depicts a giraffe. The <a href="Tswana%20people">Tswana people</a> of Botswana traditionally see the constellation <a href="Crux">Crux</a> as two giraffes – <a href="Acrux">Acrux</a> and <a href="Beta%20Crucis">Mimosa</a> forming a male, and <a href="Gacrux">Gacrux</a> and <a href="Delta%20Crucis">Delta Crucis</a> forming the female.

Giraffes were probably common targets for hunters throughout Africa. Different parts of their bodies were used for different purposes. Their meat was used for food. The tail hairs served as <a href="flyswatter">flyswatter</a>s, bracelets, necklaces and thread. Shields, sandals and drums were made using the skin, and the strings of musical instruments were from the tendons. The smoke from burning giraffe skins was used by the medicine men of <a href="Buganda">Buganda</a> to treat nose bleeds. The <a href="Humur">Humr</a> people of <a href="Kordofan">Kordofan</a>, <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a> consume the drink Umm Nyolokh; which is prepared from the <a href="liver">liver</a> and <a href="bone%20marrow">bone marrow</a> of giraffes. <a href="Richard%20Rudgley">Richard Rudgley</a> hypothesised that Umm Nyolokh might contain <a href="N%2CN-Dimethyltryptamine">DMT</a> and certain online websites further theorise that giraffe liver might owe its putative psychoactivity to substances ( possibly <a href="tryptamines">tryptamines</a> ) derived from <a href="psychoactive%20plant">psychoactive plant</a>s, such as <a href="Acacia">Acacia</a> spp. consumed by the animal. The drink is said to cause hallucinations of giraffes, believed to be the giraffes' ghosts by the Humr. In the 19th century, European explorers began to hunt them for sport. Habitat destruction has hurt the giraffe, too: in the <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a>, the need for firewood and grazing room for livestock has led to <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>. Normally, giraffes can coexist with livestock, since they do not directly compete with them. In 2017, severe droughts in northern Kenya have led to increased tensions over land and the killing of wildlife by herders, with giraffe populations being particularly hit.

Aerial survey is the most common method of monitoring giraffe population trends in the vast roadless tracts of African landscapes, but aerial methods are known to undercount giraffes. Ground-based survey methods are more accurate and should be used in conjunction with aerial surveys to make accurate estimates of population sizes and trends. In 2010, giraffes were assessed as <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a> from a conservation perspective by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN), but the 2016 assessment categorized giraffes as <a href="Vulnerable%20species">Vulnerable</a>. Giraffes have been <a href="Local%20extinction">extirpated</a> from much of their historic range including <a href="Eritrea">Eritrea</a>, <a href="Guinea">Guinea</a>, <a href="Mauritania">Mauritania</a> and <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>. They may also have disappeared from <a href="Angola">Angola</a>, <a href="Mali">Mali</a>, and <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, but have been introduced to <a href="Rwanda">Rwanda</a> and <a href="Swaziland">Swaziland</a>. Two subspecies, the <a href="West%20African%20giraffe">West African giraffe</a> and the <a href="Rothschild%20giraffe">Rothschild giraffe</a>, have been classified as <a href="Endangered%20species">endangered</a>, as wild populations of each of them number in the hundreds.

In 1997, <a href="Jonathan%20Kingdon">Jonathan Kingdon</a> suggested that the <a href="Nubian%20giraffe">Nubian giraffe</a> was the most threatened of all giraffes; , it may number fewer than 250, although this estimate is uncertain. Private game reserves have contributed to the preservation of giraffe populations in southern Africa. <a href="Giraffe%20Manor">Giraffe Manor</a> is a popular hotel in <a href="Nairobi">Nairobi</a> that also serves as sanctuary for Rothschild's giraffes. The giraffe is a protected species in most of its range. It is the <a href="national%20animal">national animal</a> of Tanzania, and is protected by law. Unauthorised killing can result in imprisonment. The UN backed Convention of Migratory Species selected giraffes for protection in 2017. In 1999, it was estimated that over 140,000 giraffes existed in the wild, estimations as of 2016 indicate that there are approximately 97,500 members of "Giraffa" in the wild, down from 155,000 in 1985. , there were more than 1,600 in captivity at <a href="Species360">Species360</a>-registered zoos (not including non-Species360 zoos or any kept by private people).

George Harrison

George Harrison (25 February 1943 – 29 November 2001) was an English musician, singer-songwriter, music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>. Often referred to as "the quiet Beatle", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a> through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and <a href="Hinduism">Hindu</a>-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work. Although the majority of the band's songs were written by <a href="Lennon%E2%80%93McCartney">John Lennon and Paul McCartney</a>, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included "<a href="Taxman">Taxman</a>", "<a href="Within%20You%20Without%20You">Within You Without You</a>", "<a href="While%20My%20Guitar%20Gently%20Weeps">While My Guitar Gently Weeps</a>", "<a href="Here%20Comes%20the%20Sun">Here Comes the Sun</a>" and "<a href="Something%20%28Beatles%20song%29">Something</a>".

Harrison's earliest musical influences included <a href="George%20Formby">George Formby</a> and <a href="Django%20Reinhardt">Django Reinhardt</a>; <a href="Carl%20Perkins">Carl Perkins</a>, <a href="Chet%20Atkins">Chet Atkins</a> and <a href="Chuck%20Berry">Chuck Berry</a> were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into <a href="folk%20rock">folk rock</a> through his interest in <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> and <a href="the%20Byrds">the Byrds</a>, and towards <a href="Indian%20classical%20music">Indian classical music</a> through his use of the <a href="sitar">sitar</a> on "<a href="Norwegian%20Wood%20%28This%20Bird%20Has%20Flown%29">Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)</a>". Having initiated the band's embracing of <a href="Transcendental%20Meditation">Transcendental Meditation</a> in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the <a href="International%20Society%20for%20Krishna%20Consciousness">Hare Krishna movement</a>. After <a href="Break-up%20of%20the%20Beatles">the band's break-up</a> in 1970, Harrison released the triple album "<a href="All%20Things%20Must%20Pass">All Things Must Pass</a>", a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, "<a href="My%20Sweet%20Lord">My Sweet Lord</a>", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the <a href="slide%20guitar">slide guitar</a>. He also organised the 1971 <a href="The%20Concert%20for%20Bangladesh">Concert for Bangladesh</a> with Indian musician <a href="Ravi%20Shankar">Ravi Shankar</a>, a precursor to later <a href="benefit%20concert">benefit concert</a>s such as <a href="Live%20Aid">Live Aid</a>. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' <a href="Apple%20Records">Apple</a> record label before founding <a href="Dark%20Horse%20Records">Dark Horse Records</a> in 1974 and co-founding <a href="HandMade%20Films">HandMade Films</a> in 1978.

Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the <a href="RIAA%20certification">platinum-selling</a> <a href="Supergroup%20%28music%29">supergroup</a> the <a href="Traveling%20Wilburys">Traveling Wilburys</a>. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by <a href="Badfinger">Badfinger</a>, <a href="Ronnie%20Wood">Ronnie Wood</a> and <a href="Billy%20Preston">Billy Preston</a>, and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a>, <a href="Ringo%20Starr">Ringo Starr</a> and <a href="Tom%20Petty">Tom Petty</a>, among others. "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time". He is a two-time <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> inductee – as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004.

Harrison's first marriage, to model <a href="Pattie%20Boyd">Pattie Boyd</a> in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he married <a href="Olivia%20Harrison">Olivia Arias</a>, with whom he had a son, <a href="Dhani%20Harrison">Dhani</a>. Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his <a href="Friar%20Park">Friar Park</a> home. His remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered according to <a href="Ganges%20in%20Hinduism">Hindu tradition</a> in a private ceremony in the <a href="Ganges">Ganges</a> and <a href="Yamuna">Yamuna</a> rivers in India. He left an <a href="Estate%20%28law%29">estate</a> of almost £100 million.

Harrison was born at <a href="12%20Arnold%20Grove">12 Arnold Grove</a> in <a href="Wavertree">Wavertree</a>, Liverpool, on 25 February 1943. He was the youngest of four children of Harold Hargreaves (or Hargrove) Harrison (1909–1978) and Louise (née French; 1911–1970). Harold was a bus conductor who had worked as a ship's steward on the <a href="White%20Star%20Line">White Star Line</a>, and Louise was a shop assistant of <a href="Irish%20Catholic">Irish Catholic</a> descent. He had one sister, Louise (born 16 August 1931), and two brothers, Harold (born 1934) and Peter (20 July 1940 – 1 June 2007).

According to Boyd, Harrison's mother was particularly supportive: "All she wanted for her children is that they should be happy, and she recognized that nothing made George quite as happy as making music." Louise was an enthusiastic music fan, and she was known among friends for her loud singing voice, which at times startled visitors by rattling the Harrisons' windows. When Louise was pregnant with George, she often listened to the weekly broadcast "Radio India". Harrison's biographer Joshua Greene wrote, "Every Sunday she tuned in to mystical sounds evoked by sitars and <a href="tabla">tabla</a>s, hoping that the exotic music would bring peace and calm to the baby in the womb."

Harrison lived the first four years of his life at 12 Arnold Grove, a terraced house on a <a href="cul-de-sac">cul-de-sac</a>. The home had an outdoor toilet and its only heat came from a single coal fire. In 1949, the family was offered a <a href="council%20house">council house</a> and moved to 25 Upton Green, <a href="Speke">Speke</a>. In 1948, at the age of five, Harrison enrolled at <a href="Dovedale%20Primary%20School">Dovedale Primary School</a>. He passed the <a href="eleven-plus%20exam">eleven-plus exam</a> and attended <a href="Liverpool%20Institute%20High%20School%20for%20Boys">Liverpool Institute High School for Boys</a> from 1954 to 1959. Though the institute did offer a music course, Harrison was disappointed with the absence of guitars, and felt the school "moulded [students] into being frightened".

Harrison's earliest musical influences included <a href="George%20Formby">George Formby</a>, <a href="Cab%20Calloway">Cab Calloway</a>, <a href="Django%20Reinhardt">Django Reinhardt</a> and <a href="Hoagy%20Carmichael">Hoagy Carmichael</a>; by the 1950s, <a href="Carl%20Perkins">Carl Perkins</a> and <a href="Lonnie%20Donegan">Lonnie Donegan</a> were significant influences. In early 1956 he had an epiphany: while riding his bicycle, he heard <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>'s "<a href="Heartbreak%20Hotel">Heartbreak Hotel</a>" playing from a nearby house, and the song piqued his interest in <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a>. He often sat at the back of the class drawing guitars in his schoolbooks, and later commented, "I was totally into guitars." Harrison cited <a href="Slim%20Whitman">Slim Whitman</a> as another early influence: "The first person I ever saw playing a guitar was Slim Whitman, either a photo of him in a magazine or live on television. Guitars were definitely coming in."

Although Harold Harrison was apprehensive about his son's interest in pursuing a music career, in 1956 he bought George a Dutch Egmond flat top acoustic guitar, which according to Harold, cost £3.10 (equivalent to £ in 2019). One of his father's friends taught Harrison how to play "<a href="Whispering%20%28song%29">Whispering</a>", "Sweet Sue" and "<a href="Dinah%20%28song%29">Dinah</a>", and, inspired by Donegan's music, Harrison formed a skiffle group called the Rebels with his brother Peter and a friend, Arthur Kelly. On the bus to school, Harrison met <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>, who also attended the Liverpool Institute, and the pair bonded over their shared love of music.

Harrison became part of the Beatles with McCartney and <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a> when the band were still a skiffle group called <a href="the%20Quarrymen">the Quarrymen</a>. In March 1958, he auditioned for the Quarrymen at <a href="Rory%20Storm">Rory Storm</a>'s Morgue Skiffle Club, playing <a href="Arthur%20%26quot%3BGuitar%20Boogie%26quot%3B%20Smith">Arthur "Guitar Boogie" Smith</a>'s "<a href="Guitar%20Boogie%20%28song%29">Guitar Boogie Shuffle</a>", but Lennon felt that Harrison, having just turned 15, was too young to join the band. McCartney arranged a second meeting, on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, during which Harrison impressed Lennon by performing the lead guitar part for the instrumental "<a href="Raunchy%20%28instrumental%29">Raunchy</a>". He began socialising with the group, filling in on guitar as needed, and then became accepted as a member. Although his father wanted him to continue his education, Harrison left school at 16 and worked for several months as an apprentice electrician at <a href="Blacklers">Blacklers</a>, a local department store. During the group's first tour of Scotland, in 1960, Harrison used the pseudonym "Carl Harrison", in reference to Carl Perkins.

In 1960, promoter <a href="Allan%20Williams">Allan Williams</a> arranged for the band, now calling themselves the Beatles, to play at the <a href="Indra">Indra</a> and <a href="Kaiserkeller">Kaiserkeller</a> clubs in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, both owned by <a href="Bruno%20Koschmider">Bruno Koschmider</a>. Their first residency in Hamburg ended prematurely when Harrison was deported for being too young to work in nightclubs. When <a href="Brian%20Epstein">Brian Epstein</a> became their manager in December 1961, he polished up their image and later secured them a recording contract with <a href="EMI">EMI</a>. The group's first single, "<a href="Love%20Me%20Do">Love Me Do</a>", peaked at number seventeen on the "<a href="Record%20Retailer">Record Retailer</a>" chart, and by the time their debut album, "<a href="Please%20Please%20Me">Please Please Me</a>", was released in early 1963, <a href="Beatlemania">Beatlemania</a> had arrived. Often serious and focused while on stage with the band, Harrison was known as "the quiet Beatle". He had two lead vocal credits on the LP, including the <a href="Lennon%E2%80%93McCartney">Lennon–McCartney</a> song "<a href="Do%20You%20Want%20to%20Know%20a%20Secret%3F">Do You Want to Know a Secret?</a>", and three on their second album, "<a href="With%20the%20Beatles">With the Beatles</a>" (1963). The latter included "<a href="Don%27t%20Bother%20Me">Don't Bother Me</a>", Harrison's first solo writing credit.

Harrison served as the Beatles' scout for new American releases, being especially knowledgeable about <a href="soul%20music">soul music</a>. By 1965's "<a href="Rubber%20Soul">Rubber Soul</a>", he had begun to lead the other Beatles into <a href="folk%20rock">folk rock</a> through his interest in <a href="the%20Byrds">the Byrds</a> and <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, and towards <a href="Indian%20classical%20music">Indian classical music</a> through his use of the sitar on "<a href="Norwegian%20Wood%20%28This%20Bird%20Has%20Flown%29">Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)</a>". He later called "Rubber Soul" his "favourite [Beatles] album". "<a href="Revolver%20%28Beatles%20album%29">Revolver</a>" (1966) included three of his compositions: "<a href="Taxman">Taxman</a>", selected as the album's opening track, "<a href="Love%20You%20To">Love You To</a>" and "<a href="I%20Want%20to%20Tell%20You">I Want to Tell You</a>". His drone-like <a href="Tanpura">tambura</a> part on Lennon's "<a href="Tomorrow%20Never%20Knows">Tomorrow Never Knows</a>" exemplified the band's ongoing exploration of non-Western instruments, while the sitar- and <a href="tabla">tabla</a>-based "Love You To" represented the Beatles' first genuine foray into Indian music. According to the <a href="ethnomusicology">ethnomusicologist</a> David Reck, the latter song set a precedent in popular music as an example of Asian culture being represented by Westerners respectfully and without parody. Author <a href="Nicholas%20Schaffner">Nicholas Schaffner</a> wrote in 1978 that following Harrison's increased association with the sitar after "Norwegian Wood", he became known as "the maharaja of <a href="raga-rock">raga-rock</a>". Harrison continued to develop his interest in non-Western instrumentation, playing <a href="swarmandal">swarmandal</a> on "<a href="Strawberry%20Fields%20Forever">Strawberry Fields Forever</a>".

By late 1966, Harrison's interests had moved away from the Beatles. This was reflected in his choice of Eastern <a href="guru">guru</a>s and religious leaders for inclusion on the album cover for "<a href="Sgt.%20Pepper%27s%20Lonely%20Hearts%20Club%20Band">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>" in 1967. His sole composition on the album was the Indian-inspired "<a href="Within%20You%20Without%20You">Within You Without You</a>", to which no other Beatle contributed. He played sitar and tambura on the track, backed by musicians from the London <a href="Asian%20Music%20Circle">Asian Music Circle</a> on <a href="Esraj">dilruba</a>, swarmandal and tabla. He later commented on the "Sgt. Pepper" album: "It was a millstone and a milestone in the music industry ... There's about half the songs I like and the other half I can't stand."
In January 1968, he recorded the basic track for his song "<a href="The%20Inner%20Light%20%28song%29">The Inner Light</a>" at EMI's studio in <a href="Mumbai">Bombay</a>, using a group of local musicians playing traditional Indian instruments. Released as the B-side to McCartney's "<a href="Lady%20Madonna">Lady Madonna</a>", it was the first Harrison composition to appear on a Beatles single. Derived from a quotation from the "<a href="Tao%20Te%20Ching">Tao Te Ching</a>", the song's lyric reflected Harrison's deepening interest in Hinduism and <a href="Transcendental%20Meditation">meditation</a>. During the recording of "<a href="The%20Beatles%20%28album%29">The Beatles</a>" that same year, tensions within the group ran high, and drummer <a href="Ringo%20Starr">Ringo Starr</a> quit briefly. Harrison's four songwriting contributions to the double album included "<a href="While%20My%20Guitar%20Gently%20Weeps">While My Guitar Gently Weeps</a>", which featured <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a> on lead guitar, and the <a href="Horn%20section">horn</a>-driven "<a href="Savoy%20Truffle">Savoy Truffle</a>".

Dylan and <a href="the%20Band">the Band</a> were a major musical influence on Harrison at the end of his career with the Beatles. While on a visit to <a href="Woodstock%2C%20New%20York">Woodstock</a> in late 1968, he established a friendship with Dylan and found himself drawn to the Band's sense of communal music-making and to the creative equality among the band members, which contrasted with Lennon and McCartney's domination of the Beatles' songwriting and creative direction. This coincided with a prolific period in his songwriting and a growing desire to assert his independence from the Beatles. Tensions among the group surfaced again in January 1969, at <a href="Twickenham%20Film%20Studios">Twickenham Studios</a>, during the filmed rehearsals that became the 1970 documentary "<a href="Let%20It%20Be%20%28film%29">Let It Be</a>". Frustrated by the cold and sterile film studio, by Lennon's creative disengagement from the Beatles, and by what he perceived as a domineering attitude from McCartney, Harrison quit the group on 10 January. He returned twelve days later, after his bandmates had agreed to move the film project to their own <a href="Apple%20Studio">Apple Studio</a> and to abandon McCartney's plan for making a return to public performance.

Relations among the Beatles were more cordial, though still strained, when the band recorded their 1969 album "<a href="Abbey%20Road">Abbey Road</a>". The LP included what Lavezzoli describes as "two classic contributions" from Harrison – "<a href="Here%20Comes%20the%20Sun">Here Comes the Sun</a>" and "<a href="Something%20%28Beatles%20song%29">Something</a>" – that saw him "finally achieve equal songwriting status" with Lennon and McCartney. During the album's recording, Harrison asserted more creative control than before, rejecting suggestions for changes to his music, particularly from McCartney. "Something" became his first A-side when issued on a <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side%23Double%20A-side">double A-side</a> single with "<a href="Come%20Together">Come Together</a>"; the song was number one in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and West Germany, and the combined sides topped the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> chart in the United States. In the 1970s <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> recorded "Something" twice (1970 and 1979) and later dubbed it "the greatest love song of the past fifty years". Lennon considered it the best song on "Abbey Road", and it became the Beatles' second most covered song after "<a href="Yesterday%20%28Beatles%20song%29">Yesterday</a>".

In May 1970 Harrison's "<a href="For%20You%20Blue">For You Blue</a>" was coupled on a US single with McCartney's "<a href="The%20Long%20and%20Winding%20Road">The Long and Winding Road</a>" and became Harrison's second chart-topper when the sides were listed together at number one on the Hot 100. His increased productivity meant that by the time of <a href="Break-up%20of%20the%20Beatles">their break-up</a> he had amassed a stockpile of unreleased compositions. While Harrison grew as a songwriter, his compositional presence on Beatles albums remained limited to two or three songs, increasing his frustration, and significantly contributing to the band's break-up. Harrison's last recording session with the Beatles was on 4 January 1970, when he, McCartney and Starr recorded his song "<a href="I%20Me%20Mine">I Me Mine</a>" for the "<a href="Let%20It%20Be">Let It Be</a>" soundtrack album.

Before the Beatles' break-up, Harrison had already recorded and released two solo albums: "<a href="Wonderwall%20Music">Wonderwall Music</a>" and "<a href="Electronic%20Sound">Electronic Sound</a>", both of which contain mainly instrumental compositions. "Wonderwall Music", a soundtrack to the 1968 film "<a href="Wonderwall%20%28film%29">Wonderwall</a>", blends Indian and Western instrumentation, while "Electronic Sound" is an experimental album that prominently features a <a href="Moog%20synthesizer">Moog synthesizer</a>. Released in November 1968, "Wonderwall Music" was the first solo album by a Beatle and the first LP released by <a href="Apple%20Records">Apple Records</a>. Indian musicians <a href="Aashish%20Khan">Aashish Khan</a> and <a href="Shivkumar%20Sharma">Shivkumar Sharma</a> performed on the album, which contains the experimental <a href="sound%20collage">sound collage</a> "<a href="Dream%20Scene%20%28song%29">Dream Scene</a>", recorded several months before Lennon's "<a href="Revolution%209">Revolution 9</a>".

In December 1969, Harrison participated in a brief tour of Europe with the American group <a href="Delaney%20%26amp%3B%20Bonnie">Delaney & Bonnie and Friends</a>. During the tour that included Clapton, <a href="Bobby%20Whitlock">Bobby Whitlock</a>, drummer <a href="Jim%20Gordon%20%28musician%29">Jim Gordon</a> and band leaders <a href="Delaney%20Bramlett">Delaney</a> and <a href="Bonnie%20Bramlett">Bonnie Bramlett</a>, Harrison began to write "<a href="My%20Sweet%20Lord">My Sweet Lord</a>", which became his first single as a solo artist. Delaney Bramlett inspired Harrison to learn slide guitar, significantly influencing his later music.

For many years, Harrison was restricted in his songwriting contributions to the Beatles' albums, but he released "All Things Must Pass", a <a href="Double%20album%23Triple%20album">triple album</a> with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison <a href="Jam%20session">jamming</a> with friends. The album was regarded by many as his best work, and it topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. The LP produced the number-one <a href="hit%20single">hit single</a> "My Sweet Lord" and the top-ten single "<a href="What%20Is%20Life">What Is Life</a>". The album was co-produced by <a href="Phil%20Spector">Phil Spector</a> using his "<a href="Wall%20of%20Sound">Wall of Sound</a>" approach, and the musicians included Starr, Clapton, <a href="Gary%20Wright">Gary Wright</a>, Preston, <a href="Klaus%20Voormann">Klaus Voormann</a>, the whole of Delaney and Bonnie's Friends band and the Apple group <a href="Badfinger">Badfinger</a>. On release, "All Things Must Pass" was received with critical acclaim; Ben Gerson of "Rolling Stone" described it as being "of classic Spectorian proportions, <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagnerian</a>, <a href="Anton%20Bruckner">Brucknerian</a>, the music of mountain tops and vast horizons". Author and <a href="musicology">musicologist</a> Ian Inglis considers the lyrics of <a href="All%20Things%20Must%20Pass%20%28song%29">the album's title track</a> "a recognition of the impermanence of human existence ... a simple and poignant conclusion" to Harrison's former band. In 1971, Bright Tunes sued Harrison for <a href="copyright%20infringement">copyright infringement</a> over "My Sweet Lord", owing to its similarity to the 1963 <a href="The%20Chiffons">Chiffons</a> hit "<a href="He%27s%20So%20Fine">He's So Fine</a>". When the case was heard in the <a href="United%20States%20district%20court">United States district court</a> in 1976, he denied deliberately plagiarising the song, but lost the case, as the judge ruled that he had done so subconsciously.

In 2000, Apple Records released a thirtieth anniversary edition of the album, and Harrison actively participated in its promotion. In an interview, he reflected on the work: "It's just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles, really. It was me sort of getting out of the Beatles and just going my own way ... it was a very happy occasion." He commented on the production: "Well, in those days it was like the <a href="Reverberation">reverb</a> was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now. In fact, I don't use reverb at all. I can't stand it ... You know, it's hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now."

Harrison responded to a request from Ravi Shankar by organising a charity event, the Concert for Bangladesh, which took place on 1 August 1971. The event drew over 40,000 people to two shows in New York's <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a>. The goal of the event was to raise money to aid starving refugees during the <a href="Bangladesh%20Liberation%20War">Bangladesh Liberation War</a>. Shankar opened the show, which featured popular musicians such as Dylan, Clapton, <a href="Leon%20Russell">Leon Russell</a>, Badfinger, Preston and Starr.

A triple album, "<a href="The%20Concert%20for%20Bangladesh%20%28album%29">The Concert for Bangladesh</a>", was released by Apple in December, followed by a <a href="The%20Concert%20for%20Bangladesh%20%28film%29">concert film</a> in 1972. Credited to "George Harrison and Friends", the album topped the UK chart and peaked at number 2 in the US, and went on to win the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Album%20of%20the%20Year">Grammy Award for Album of the Year</a>. Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds, but Harrison commented: "Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation ... The money we raised was secondary, and although we had some money problems ... they still got plenty ... even though it was a drop in the ocean. The main thing was, we spread the word and helped get the war ended."

Harrison's 1973 album "<a href="Living%20in%20the%20Material%20World">Living in the Material World</a>" held the number one spot on the "Billboard" albums chart for five weeks, and the album's single, "<a href="Give%20Me%20Love%20%28Give%20Me%20Peace%20on%20Earth%29">Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)</a>", also reached number one in the US. In the UK, the LP peaked at number two and the single reached number 8. The album was lavishly produced and packaged, and its dominant message was Harrison's Hindu beliefs. In Greene's opinion it "contained many of the strongest compositions of his career". <a href="Stephen%20Holden">Stephen Holden</a>, writing in "Rolling Stone", felt the album was "vastly appealing" and "profoundly seductive", and that it stood "alone as an article of faith, miraculous in its radiance". Other reviewers were less enthusiastic, describing the release as awkward, sanctimonious and overly sentimental.
In November 1974, Harrison became the first ex-Beatle to tour North America when he began his 45-date <a href="George%20Harrison%20and%20Ravi%20Shankar%27s%201974%20North%20American%20tour">Dark Horse Tour</a>. The shows included guest spots by his band members Billy Preston and <a href="Tom%20Scott%20%28musician%29">Tom Scott</a>, and traditional and contemporary Indian music performed by "Ravi Shankar, Family and Friends". Despite numerous positive reviews, the consensus reaction to the tour was negative. Some fans found Shankar's significant presence to be a bizarre disappointment, and many were affronted by what Inglis described as Harrison's "sermonizing". Further, he reworked the lyrics to several Beatles songs, and his <a href="laryngitis">laryngitis</a>-affected vocals led to some critics calling the tour "dark hoarse". The author Robert Rodriguez commented: "While the Dark Horse tour might be considered a noble failure, there were a number of fans who were tuned-in to what was being attempted. They went away ecstatic, conscious that they had just witnessed something so uplifting that it could never be repeated." Simon Leng called the tour "groundbreaking" and "revolutionary in its presentation of Indian Music".

In December, Harrison released "<a href="Dark%20Horse%20%28George%20Harrison%20album%29">Dark Horse</a>", which was an album that earned him the least favourable reviews of his career. "Rolling Stone" called it "the chronicle of a performer out of his element, working to a deadline, enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver a new 'LP product', rehearse a band, and assemble a cross-country tour, all within three weeks". The album reached number 4 on the "Billboard" chart and the single "<a href="Dark%20Horse%20%28George%20Harrison%20song%29">Dark Horse</a>" reached number 15, but they failed to make an impact in the UK. The music critic <a href="Mikal%20Gilmore">Mikal Gilmore</a> described "Dark Horse" as "one of Harrison's most fascinating works – a record about change and loss".

Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records, the <a href="soul%20music">soul music</a>-inspired "<a href="Extra%20Texture%20%28Read%20All%20About%20It%29">Extra Texture (Read All About It)</a>" (1975), peaked at number 8 on the "Billboard" chart and number 16 in the UK. Harrison considered it the least satisfactory of the three albums he had recorded since "All Things Must Pass". Leng identified "bitterness and dismay" in many of the tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: "He wasn't up for it ... It was a terrible time because I think there was a lot of cocaine going around, and that's when I got out of the picture ... I didn't like his frame of mind". He released two singles from the LP: "<a href="You%20%28George%20Harrison%20song%29">You</a>", which reached the "Billboard" top 20, and "<a href="This%20Guitar%20%28Can%27t%20Keep%20from%20Crying%29">This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)</a>", Apple's final original single release.

"<a href="Thirty%20Three%20%26amp%3B%201/3">Thirty Three & 1/3</a>" (1976), Harrison's first album release on his own Dark Horse Records label, produced the hit singles "<a href="This%20Song">This Song</a>" and "<a href="Crackerbox%20Palace">Crackerbox Palace</a>", both of which reached the top 25 in the US. The <a href="surreal%20humour">surreal humour</a> of "Crackerbox Palace" reflected Harrison's association with <a href="Monty%20Python">Monty Python</a>'s <a href="Eric%20Idle">Eric Idle</a>, who directed a comical music video for the song. With an emphasis on melody and musicianship, and a more subtle subject matter than the pious message of his earlier works, "Thirty Three & 1/3" earned Harrison his most favourable critical notices in the US since "All Things Must Pass". The album peaked just outside the top ten there, but outsold his previous two LPs. As part of his promotion for the release, Harrison performed on "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" with <a href="Paul%20Simon">Paul Simon</a>.

In 1979, Harrison released "<a href="George%20Harrison%20%28album%29">George Harrison</a>", which followed his second marriage and the birth of his son <a href="Dhani%20Harrison">Dhani</a>. Co-produced by <a href="Russ%20Titelman">Russ Titelman</a>, the album and the single "<a href="Blow%20Away">Blow Away</a>" both made the "Billboard" top 20. The album marked the beginning of Harrison's gradual retreat from the music business, with several of the songs having been written in the tranquil setting of <a href="Maui">Maui</a> in the <a href="Hawaiian%20Islands">Hawaiian archipelago</a>. Leng described "George Harrison" as "melodic and lush ... peaceful ... the work of a man who had lived the rock and roll dream twice over and was now embracing domestic as well as spiritual bliss".

The <a href="Death%20of%20John%20Lennon">murder of John Lennon</a> on 8 December 1980 disturbed Harrison and reinforced his decades-long concern about <a href="stalking">stalkers</a>. The tragedy was also a deep personal loss, although Harrison and Lennon had little contact in the years before Lennon was killed. Following the murder, Harrison commented: "After all we went through together I had and still have great love and respect for John Lennon. I am shocked and stunned." Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had written for Starr in order to make the song a tribute to Lennon. "<a href="All%20Those%20Years%20Ago">All Those Years Ago</a>", which included vocal contributions from Paul and Linda McCartney, as well as Starr's original drum part, peaked at number two in the US charts. The single was included on the album "<a href="Somewhere%20in%20England">Somewhere in England</a>" in 1981.

Harrison did not release any new albums for five years after 1982's "<a href="Gone%20Troppo">Gone Troppo</a>" received little notice from critics or the public. During this period he made several guest appearances, including a 1985 performance at a tribute to <a href="Carl%20Perkins">Carl Perkins</a> titled "". In March 1986 he made a surprise appearance during the finale of the <a href="Heart%20Beat%2086">Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert</a>, an event organised to raise money for the <a href="Heart%20Beat%2086">Birmingham Children's Hospital</a>. The following year, he appeared at <a href="The%20Prince%27s%20Trust">The Prince's Trust</a> concert at London's <a href="Wembley%20Arena">Wembley Arena</a>, performing "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" and "Here Comes the Sun". In February 1987 he joined Dylan, <a href="John%20Fogerty">John Fogerty</a> and <a href="Jesse%20Ed%20Davis">Jesse Ed Davis</a> on stage for a two-hour performance with the blues musician <a href="Taj%20Mahal%20%28musician%29">Taj Mahal</a>. Harrison recalled: "Bob rang me up and asked if I wanted to come out for the evening and see Taj Mahal ... So we went there and had a few of these Mexican beers – and had a few more ... Bob says, 'Hey, why don't we all get up and play, and you can sing?' But every time I got near the microphone, Dylan comes up and just starts singing this rubbish in my ear, trying to throw me."

In November 1987 Harrison released the platinum album "<a href="Cloud%20Nine%20%28George%20Harrison%20album%29">Cloud Nine</a>". Co-produced with <a href="Jeff%20Lynne">Jeff Lynne</a> of <a href="Electric%20Light%20Orchestra">Electric Light Orchestra</a> (ELO), the album included Harrison's rendition of <a href="James%20Ray%20%28singer%29">James Ray's</a> "<a href="Got%20My%20Mind%20Set%20on%20You">Got My Mind Set on You</a>", which went to number one in the US and number two in the UK. The accompanying music video received substantial airplay, and another single, "<a href="When%20We%20Was%20Fab">When We Was Fab</a>", a retrospective of the Beatles' career, earned two <a href="MTV%20Music%20Video%20Award">MTV Music Video Award</a>s nominations in 1988. Recorded at his estate in Friar Park, Harrison's slide guitar playing featured prominently on the album, which included several of his long-time musical collaborators, including Clapton, <a href="Jim%20Keltner">Jim Keltner</a> and <a href="Jim%20Horn">Jim Horn</a>. "Cloud Nine" reached number eight and number ten on the US and UK charts respectively, and several tracks from the album achieved placement on "Billboard"s <a href="Mainstream%20Rock%20%28chart%29">Mainstream Rock</a> chart – "<a href="Devil%27s%20Radio">Devil's Radio</a>", "<a href="This%20Is%20Love%20%28George%20Harrison%20song%29">This Is Love</a>" and "<a href="Cloud%209%20%28George%20Harrison%20song%29">Cloud 9</a>".

In 1988, Harrison formed the Traveling Wilburys with Jeff Lynne, <a href="Roy%20Orbison">Roy Orbison</a>, Bob Dylan and Tom Petty. The band had gathered in Dylan's garage to record a song for a Harrison European single release. Harrison's record company decided the track, "<a href="Handle%20with%20Care%20%28song%29">Handle with Care</a>", was too good for its original purpose as a B-side and asked for a full album. The LP, "<a href="Traveling%20Wilburys%20Vol.%201">Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1</a>", was released in October 1988 and recorded under pseudonyms as half-brothers, supposed sons of Charles Truscott Wilbury, Sr. It reached number 16 in the UK and number 3 in the US, where it was certified <a href="RIAA%20certification">triple platinum</a>. Harrison's pseudonym on the album was "Nelson Wilbury"; he used the name "Spike Wilbury" for their second album.

In 1989, Harrison and Starr appeared in the music video for Petty's song "<a href="I%20Won%27t%20Back%20Down">I Won't Back Down</a>". In October that year, Harrison assembled and released "<a href="Best%20of%20Dark%20Horse%201976%E2%80%931989">Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989</a>", a compilation of his later solo work. The album included three new songs, including "<a href="Cheer%20Down">Cheer Down</a>", which Harrison had recently contributed to the "<a href="Lethal%20Weapon%202">Lethal Weapon 2</a>" film soundtrack.

Following Orbison's death in December 1988, the Wilburys recorded as a four-piece. Their second album, issued in October 1990, was mischievously titled "<a href="Traveling%20Wilburys%20Vol.%203">Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3</a>". According to Lynne, "That was George's idea. He said, 'Let's confuse the buggers.'" It peaked at number 14 in the UK and number 11 in the US, where it was certified platinum. The Wilburys never performed live, and the group did not record together again following the release of their second album.

In December 1991, Harrison joined Clapton for a tour of Japan. It was Harrison's first since 1974 and no others followed. On 6 April 1992, Harrison held a benefit concert for the <a href="Natural%20Law%20Party">Natural Law Party</a> at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>, his first London performance since <a href="The%20Beatles%27%20rooftop%20concert">the Beatles' 1969 rooftop concert</a>. In October 1992, he performed at a Bob Dylan tribute concert at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> in New York City, playing alongside Dylan, Clapton, McGuinn, Petty and <a href="Neil%20Young">Neil Young</a>.

In 1994 Harrison began a collaboration with McCartney, Starr and producer Jeff Lynne for the "Beatles Anthology" project. This included the recording of two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon as well as lengthy interviews about the Beatles' career. Released in December 1995, "<a href="Free%20as%20a%20Bird">Free as a Bird</a>" was the first new Beatles single since 1970. In March 1996, they released a second single, "<a href="Real%20Love%20%28Beatles%20song%29">Real Love</a>". Harrison refused to participate in the completion of a third song. He later commented on the project: "I hope somebody does this to all my crap demos when I'm dead, make them into hit songs."

Following the "Anthology" project, Harrison collaborated with Ravi Shankar on the latter's "<a href="Chants%20of%20India">Chants of India</a>". Harrison's final television appearance was a <a href="VH1">VH-1</a> special to promote the album, taped in May 1997. Soon afterwards, Harrison was diagnosed with <a href="Head%20and%20neck%20cancer">throat cancer</a>; he was treated with <a href="Radiation%20therapy">radiotherapy</a>, which was thought at the time to be successful. He publicly blamed years of smoking for the illness.

In January 1998, Harrison attended Carl Perkins' funeral in <a href="Jackson%2C%20Tennessee">Jackson, Tennessee</a>, where he performed a brief rendition of Perkins' song "<a href="Your%20True%20Love">Your True Love</a>". In May, he represented the Beatles at London's High Court in their successful bid to gain control of unauthorised recordings made of a 1962 performance by the band at the <a href="Star-Club">Star-Club</a> in Hamburg. The following year, he was the most active of his former bandmates in promoting the reissue of their 1968 animated film "<a href="Yellow%20Submarine%20%28film%29">Yellow Submarine</a>".
On 30 December 1999, Harrison and his wife were attacked at their home, <a href="Friar%20Park">Friar Park</a>. Michael Abram, a 34-year-old man suffering from <a href="paranoid%20schizophrenia">paranoid schizophrenia</a>, broke in and attacked Harrison with a kitchen knife, puncturing a lung and causing head injuries before Olivia Harrison incapacitated the assailant by striking him repeatedly with a <a href="Fire%20iron%23Types%20of%20fire%20irons">fireplace poker</a> and a lamp. Following the attack, Harrison was hospitalised with more than 40 stab wounds, and part of his punctured lung was removed. He released a statement soon afterwards regarding his assailant: "He wasn't a burglar, and he certainly wasn't auditioning for the Traveling Wilburys. <a href="Adi%20Shankara">Adi Shankara</a>, an Indian historical, spiritual and groovy-type person, once said, 'Life is fragile like a raindrop on a lotus leaf.' And you'd better believe it."

In May 2001, it was revealed that Harrison had undergone an operation to remove a cancerous growth from one of his lungs, and in July, it was reported that he was being treated for a <a href="brain%20tumor">brain tumour</a> at a clinic in Switzerland. While in Switzerland, Starr visited him but had to cut short his stay in order to travel to Boston, where his daughter was undergoing emergency brain surgery, prompting Harrison to quip: "Do you want me to come with you?" In November 2001, he began radiotherapy at <a href="Staten%20Island%20University%20Hospital">Staten Island University Hospital</a> in New York City for <a href="lung%20cancer">non-small cell lung cancer</a> which had <a href="metastasis">spread</a> to his brain. When the news was made public, Harrison bemoaned his physician's breach of privacy, and his estate later claimed damages. On 12 November in New York, Harrison, Starr and McCartney came together for the last time.

On 29 November 2001, Harrison died at a friend's home in Los Angeles, aged 58. He was <a href="Cremation">cremated</a> at <a href="Hollywood%20Forever%20Cemetery">Hollywood Forever Cemetery</a> and his funeral was held at the <a href="Self-Realization%20Fellowship%20Lake%20Shrine">Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine</a> in <a href="Pacific%20Palisades%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Pacific Palisades, California</a>. His close family scattered his ashes according to <a href="Ganga%20in%20Hinduism">Hindu tradition</a> in a private ceremony in the <a href="Ganges">Ganges</a> and <a href="Yamuna">Yamuna</a> rivers near <a href="Varanasi">Varanasi</a>, India. He left almost £100 million in his will.

Harrison's final album, "<a href="Brainwashed%20%28George%20Harrison%20album%29">Brainwashed</a>" (2002), was released posthumously after it was completed by his son Dhani and Jeff Lynne. A quotation from the "<a href="Bhagavad%20Gita">Bhagavad Gita</a>" is included in the album's liner notes: "There never was a time when you or I did not exist. Nor will there be any future when we shall cease to be." A media-only single, "<a href="Stuck%20Inside%20a%20Cloud">Stuck Inside a Cloud</a>", which Leng described as "a uniquely candid reaction to illness and mortality", achieved number 27 on "Billboard"s Adult Contemporary chart. The single "<a href="Any%20Road">Any Road</a>", released in May 2003, peaked at number 37 on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>. "Marwa Blues" went on to receive the <a href="46th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">2004 Grammy Award</a> for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Pop%20Instrumental%20Performance">Best Pop Instrumental Performance</a>, while "Any Road" was nominated for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Male%20Pop%20Vocal%20Performance">Best Male Pop Vocal Performance</a>.

Harrison's guitar work with the Beatles was varied and flexible. Although not fast or flashy, his lead guitar playing was solid and typified the more subdued lead guitar style of the early 1960s; his rhythm guitar playing was as innovative, such as using a <a href="capo">capo</a> to shorten the strings on an acoustic guitar, as on the "<a href="Rubber%20Soul">Rubber Soul</a>" album and "<a href="Here%20Comes%20the%20Sun">Here Comes the Sun</a>", to create a bright, sweet sound. Eric Clapton felt that Harrison was "clearly an innovator" as he was "taking certain elements of R&B and rock and rockabilly and creating something unique". "Rolling Stone" founder <a href="Jann%20Wenner">Jann Wenner</a> described Harrison as "a guitarist who was never showy but who had an innate, eloquent melodic sense. He played exquisitely in the service of the song". The <a href="guitar%20picking">guitar picking</a> style of <a href="Chet%20Atkins">Chet Atkins</a> and Carl Perkins influenced Harrison, giving a <a href="country%20music">country music</a> feel to many of the Beatles' recordings. He identified <a href="Chuck%20Berry">Chuck Berry</a> as another early influence.

In 1961 the Beatles recorded "<a href="Cry%20for%20a%20Shadow">Cry for a Shadow</a>", a blues-inspired instrumental co-written by Lennon and Harrison, who is credited with composing the song's lead guitar part, building on unusual chord voicings and imitating the style of other English groups such as <a href="the%20Shadows">the Shadows</a>. Harrison's liberal use of the <a href="diatonic%20scale">diatonic scale</a> in his guitar playing reveals the influence of <a href="Buddy%20Holly">Buddy Holly</a>, and his interest in Berry inspired him to compose songs based on the <a href="blues%20scale">blues scale</a> while incorporating a <a href="rockabilly">rockabilly</a> feel in the style of Perkins. Another of Harrison's musical techniques was the use of guitar lines written in <a href="octave">octave</a>s, as on "<a href="I%27ll%20Be%20on%20My%20Way">I'll Be on My Way</a>".

By 1964 he had begun to develop a distinctive personal style as a guitarist, writing parts that featured the use of nonresolving tones, as with the ending chord arpeggios on "<a href="A%20Hard%20Day%27s%20Night%20%28song%29">A Hard Day's Night</a>". On this and other songs from the period, he used a <a href="Rickenbacker%20360/12">Rickenbacker 360/12</a> – an electric guitar with twelve strings, the low eight of which are tuned in pairs, one octave apart, with the higher four being pairs tuned in unison. His use of the Rickenbacker on "<a href="A%20Hard%20Day%27s%20Night%20%28album%29">A Hard Day's Night</a>" helped to popularise the model, and the jangly sound became so prominent that "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" termed it the Beatles' "secret weapon". In 1965 Harrison used an <a href="Expression%20pedal%23Guitars%20and%20digital%20effects">expression pedal</a> to control his guitar's volume on "<a href="I%20Need%20You%20%28The%20Beatles%20song%29">I Need You</a>", creating a syncopated <a href="String%20instrument%23Contact%20points%20along%20the%20string">flautando</a> effect with the melody resolving its <a href="Consonance%20and%20dissonance%23Dissonance">dissonance</a> through tonal displacements. He used the same volume-swell technique on "<a href="Yes%20It%20Is">Yes It Is</a>", applying what Everett described as "ghostly articulation" to the song's <a href="Harmonic">natural harmonics</a>.

In 1966 Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to "Revolver". He played <a href="Backmasking">backwards</a> guitar on Lennon's composition "<a href="I%27m%20Only%20Sleeping">I'm Only Sleeping</a>" and a guitar <a href="counter-melody">counter-melody</a> on "<a href="And%20Your%20Bird%20Can%20Sing">And Your Bird Can Sing</a>" that moved in parallel octaves above McCartney's bass downbeats. His guitar playing on "<a href="I%20Want%20to%20Tell%20You">I Want to Tell You</a>" exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for "Sgt Pepper"s "<a href="Lucy%20in%20the%20Sky%20with%20Diamonds">Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds</a>" mirrors Lennon's vocal line in much the same way that a <a href="sarangi">sarangi</a> player accompanies a <a href="khyal">khyal</a> singer in a Hindu <a href="bhajan">devotional song</a>.

Everett described Harrison's guitar solo from "<a href="Old%20Brown%20Shoe">Old Brown Shoe</a>" as "stinging [and] highly Claptonesque". He identified two of the composition's significant <a href="Motif%20%28music%29">motifs</a>: a bluesy <a href="trichord">trichord</a> and a <a href="diminished%20triad">diminished triad</a> with roots in A and E. Huntley called the song "a sizzling rocker with a ferocious ... solo". In Greene's opinion, Harrison's demo for "Old Brown Shoe" contains "one of the most complex lead guitar solos on any Beatles song".

Harrison's playing on "Abbey Road", and in particular on "Something", marked a significant moment in his development as a guitarist. The song's guitar solo shows a varied range of influences, incorporating the blues guitar style of Clapton and the styles of Indian <a href="Gamaka%20%28music%29">gamakas</a>. According to author and musicologist Kenneth Womack: "'Something' meanders toward the most unforgettable of Harrison's guitar solos ... A masterpiece in simplicity, [it] reaches toward the sublime".

After <a href="Delaney%20Bramlett">Delaney Bramlett</a> inspired him to learn slide guitar, Harrison began to incorporate it into his solo work, which allowed him to mimic many traditional Indian instruments, including the sarangi and the <a href="Esraj">dilruba</a>. Leng described Harrison's slide guitar solo on Lennon's "<a href="How%20Do%20You%20Sleep%3F%20%28John%20Lennon%20song%29">How Do You Sleep?"</a> as a departure for "the sweet soloist of 'Something'", calling his playing "rightly famed ... one of Harrison's greatest guitar statements". Lennon commented: "That's the best he's ever fucking played in his life."

A <a href="Music%20of%20Hawaii">Hawaiian</a> influence is notable in much of Harrison's music, ranging from his slide guitar work on "Gone Troppo" (1982) to his televised performance of the <a href="Cab%20Calloway">Cab Calloway</a> standard "<a href="Between%20the%20Devil%20and%20the%20Deep%20Blue%20Sea%20%28song%29">Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea</a>" on <a href="ukulele">ukulele</a> in 1992. Lavezzoli described Harrison's slide playing on the Grammy-winning instrumental "Marwa Blues" (2002) as demonstrating Hawaiian influences while comparing the melody to an Indian <a href="sarod">sarod</a> or <a href="veena">veena</a>, calling it "yet another demonstration of Harrison's unique slide approach". Harrison was an admirer of <a href="George%20Formby">George Formby</a> and a member of the Ukulele Society of Great Britain, and played a ukulele solo in the style of Formby at the end of "<a href="Free%20as%20a%20Bird">Free as a Bird</a>". He performed at a Formby convention in 1991, and served as the honorary president of the George Formby Appreciation Society. Harrison played bass guitar on numerous tracks, including the Beatles songs "<a href="She%20Said%20She%20Said">She Said She Said</a>", "<a href="Golden%20Slumbers">Golden Slumbers</a>", "<a href="Birthday%20%28The%20Beatles%20song%29">Birthday</a>" and "<a href="Honey%20Pie">Honey Pie</a>". He also played bass on several solo recordings, including "<a href="Faster%20%28George%20Harrison%20song%29">Faster</a>", "<a href="Wake%20Up%20My%20Love">Wake Up My Love</a>" and "<a href="Bye%20Bye%20Love%20%28The%20Everly%20Brothers%20song%29%23George%20Harrison%27s%20version">Bye Bye Love</a>".

During the Beatles' American tour in August 1965, Harrison's friend <a href="David%20Crosby">David Crosby</a> of the Byrds introduced him to <a href="Indian%20classical%20music">Indian classical music</a> and the work of <a href="sitar">sitar</a> maestro <a href="Ravi%20Shankar">Ravi Shankar</a>. Harrison described Shankar as "the first person who ever impressed me in my life ... and he was the only person who didn't try to impress me." Harrison became fascinated with the sitar and immersed himself in <a href="Music%20of%20India">Indian music</a>. According to Lavezzoli, Harrison's introduction of the instrument on the Beatles' song "Norwegian Wood" "opened the floodgates for Indian instrumentation in rock music, triggering what Shankar would call 'The Great Sitar Explosion' of 1966–67". Lavezzoli recognises Harrison as "the man most responsible for this phenomenon".

In June 1966 Harrison met Shankar at the home of Mrs Angadi of the Asian Music Circle, asked to be his student, and was accepted. Before this meeting, Harrison had recorded his "Revolver" track "<a href="Love%20You%20To">Love You To</a>", contributing a sitar part that Lavezzoli describes as an "astonishing improvement" over "Norwegian Wood" and "the most accomplished performance on sitar by any rock musician". On 6 July, Harrison travelled to India to buy a sitar from Rikhi Ram & Sons in New Delhi. In September, following the Beatles' final tour, he returned to India to study sitar for six weeks with Shankar. He initially stayed in Bombay until fans learned of his arrival, then moved to a houseboat on a remote lake in <a href="Kashmir">Kashmir</a>. During this visit, he also received tutelage from <a href="Shambhu%20Das">Shambhu Das</a>, Shankar's protégé.

Harrison studied the instrument until 1968, when, following a discussion with Shankar about the need to find his "roots", an encounter with Clapton and <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> at a hotel in New York convinced him to return to guitar playing. Harrison commented: "I decided ... I'm not going to be a great sitar player ... because I should have started at least fifteen years earlier." Harrison continued to use Indian instrumentation occasionally on his solo albums and remained strongly associated with the genre. Lavezzoli groups him with <a href="Paul%20Simon">Paul Simon</a> and <a href="Peter%20Gabriel">Peter Gabriel</a> as the three rock musicians who have given the most "mainstream exposure to non-Western musics, or the concept of '<a href="world%20music">world music</a>'".

Harrison wrote his first song, "Don't Bother Me", while sick in a hotel bed in Bournemouth during August 1963, as "an exercise to see if I "could" write a song", as he remembered. His songwriting ability improved throughout the Beatles' career, but his material did not earn full respect from Lennon, McCartney and producer <a href="George%20Martin">George Martin</a> until near the group's break-up. In 1969, McCartney told Lennon: "Until this year, our songs have been better than George's. Now this year his songs are at least as good as ours". Harrison often had difficulty getting the band to record his songs. Most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contain at least two Harrison compositions; three of his songs appear on "Revolver", "the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter", according to Inglis.

Harrison wrote the <a href="chord%20progression">chord progression</a> of "Don't Bother Me" almost exclusively in the <a href="Dorian%20mode">Dorian mode</a>, demonstrating an interest in exotic tones that eventually culminated in his embrace of Indian music. The latter proved a strong influence on his songwriting and contributed to his innovation within the Beatles. According to <a href="Mikal%20Gilmore">Mikal Gilmore</a> of "Rolling Stone", "Harrison's openness to new sounds and textures cleared new paths for his rock and roll compositions. His use of dissonance on ... 'Taxman' and 'I Want to Tell You' was revolutionary in popular music – and perhaps more originally creative than the avant-garde mannerisms that Lennon and McCartney borrowed from the music of <a href="Karlheinz%20Stockhausen">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a>, <a href="Luciano%20Berio">Luciano Berio</a>, <a href="Edgard%20Var%C3%A8se">Edgard Varèse</a> and <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a> ..."

Of the 1967 Harrison song "Within You Without You", author Gerry Farrell said that Harrison had created a "new form", calling the composition "a quintessential fusion of pop and Indian music". Lennon called the song one of Harrison's best: "His mind and his music are clear. There is his innate talent, he brought that sound together." In his next fully Indian-styled song, "The Inner Light", Harrison embraced the <a href="Carnatic%20music">Karnatak</a> discipline of Indian music, rather than the <a href="Hindustani%20classical%20music">Hindustani</a> style he had used in "Love You To" and "Within You Without You". Writing in 1997, Farrell commented: "It is a mark of Harrison's sincere involvement with Indian music that, nearly thirty years on, the Beatles' 'Indian' songs remain the most imaginative and successful examples of this type of fusion – for example, '<a href="Blue%20Jay%20Way">Blue Jay Way</a>' and 'The Inner Light'."

Beatles biographer Bob Spitz described "Something" as a masterpiece, and "an intensely stirring romantic ballad that would challenge 'Yesterday' and 'Michelle' as one of the most recognizable songs they ever produced". Inglis considered "Abbey Road" a turning point in Harrison's development as a songwriter and musician. He described Harrison's two contributions to the LP, "Here Comes the Sun" and "Something", as "exquisite", declaring them equal to any previous Beatles songs.

From 1968 onwards, Harrison collaborated with other musicians; he brought in <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a> to play lead guitar on "<a href="While%20My%20Guitar%20Gently%20Weeps">While My Guitar Gently Weeps</a>" for the 1968 Beatles' <a href="The%20Beatles%20%28album%29">White Album</a>, and collaborated with <a href="John%20Barham">John Barham</a> on his 1968 debut solo album, "<a href="Wonderwall%20Music">Wonderwall Music</a>", which included contributions from Clapton again, as well as <a href="Peter%20Tork">Peter Tork</a> from <a href="the%20Monkees">the Monkees</a>. He played on tracks by <a href="Dave%20Mason">Dave Mason</a>, <a href="Nicky%20Hopkins">Nicky Hopkins</a>, <a href="Alvin%20Lee">Alvin Lee</a>, <a href="Ronnie%20Wood">Ronnie Wood</a>, Billy Preston and <a href="Tom%20Scott%20%28musician%29">Tom Scott</a>. Harrison co-wrote songs and music with Dylan, Clapton, Preston, Doris Troy, David Bromberg, Gary Wright, Wood, Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty, among others. Harrison's music projects during the final years of the Beatles included producing Apple Records artists <a href="Doris%20Troy">Doris Troy</a>, <a href="Jackie%20Lomax">Jackie Lomax</a> and Billy Preston.

Harrison co-wrote the song "<a href="Badge%20%28song%29">Badge</a>" with Clapton, which was included on <a href="Cream%20%28band%29">Cream</a>'s 1969 album, "<a href="Goodbye%20%28Cream%20album%29">Goodbye</a>". Harrison played rhythm guitar on the track, using the pseudonym "L'Angelo Misterioso" for contractual reasons. In May 1970 he played guitar on several songs during a recording session for Dylan's album "<a href="New%20Morning">New Morning</a>". Between 1971 and 1973 he co-wrote and/or produced three top ten hits for Starr: "<a href="It%20Don%27t%20Come%20Easy">It Don't Come Easy</a>", "<a href="Back%20Off%20Boogaloo">Back Off Boogaloo</a>" and "<a href="Photograph%20%28Ringo%20Starr%20song%29">Photograph</a>". Aside from "How Do You Sleep?", his contributions to Lennon's 1971 album "<a href="Imagine%20%28John%20Lennon%20album%29">Imagine</a>" included a slide guitar solo on "<a href="Gimme%20Some%20Truth">Gimme Some Truth</a>" and dobro on "<a href="Crippled%20Inside">Crippled Inside</a>". Also that year, he produced and played slide guitar on Badfinger's top ten hit "<a href="Day%20After%20Day%20%28Badfinger%20song%29">Day After Day</a>", and a dobro on Preston's "<a href="I%20Wrote%20a%20Simple%20Song%20%28song%29">I Wrote a Simple Song</a>". He worked with <a href="Harry%20Nilsson">Harry Nilsson</a> on "<a href="You%27re%20Breakin%27%20My%20Heart">You're Breakin' My Heart</a>" (1972) and with <a href="Cheech%20%26amp%3B%20Chong">Cheech & Chong</a> on "<a href="Basketball%20Jones%20featuring%20Tyrone%20Shoelaces">Basketball Jones</a>" (1973).

In 1974 Harrison founded <a href="Dark%20Horse%20Records">Dark Horse Records</a> as an avenue for collaboration with other musicians. He wanted Dark Horse to serve as a creative outlet for artists, as Apple Records had for the Beatles. Eric Idle commented: "He's extremely generous, and he backs and supports all sorts of people that you'll never, ever hear of." The first acts signed to the new label were Ravi Shankar and the duo <a href="Splinter%20%28band%29">Splinter</a>. Harrison produced and made multiple musical contributions to Splinter's debut album, "<a href="The%20Place%20I%20Love">The Place I Love</a>", which provided Dark Horse with its first hit, "Costafine Town". He also produced and played guitar and <a href="autoharp">autoharp</a> on Shankar's "<a href="Shankar%20Family%20%26amp%3B%20Friends">Shankar Family & Friends</a>", the label's other inaugural release. Other artists signed by Dark Horse include <a href="Attitudes%20%28band%29">Attitudes</a>, <a href="Henry%20McCullough">Henry McCullough</a>, Jiva and <a href="Five%20Stairsteps">Stairsteps</a>.

Harrison collaborated with Tom Scott on Scott's 1975 album "<a href="New%20York%20Connection">New York Connection</a>", and in 1981 he played guitar on "Walk a Thin Line", from <a href="Mick%20Fleetwood">Mick Fleetwood</a>'s "<a href="The%20Visitor%20%28Mick%20Fleetwood%20album%29">The Visitor</a>". His contributions to Starr's solo career continued with "<a href="Wrack%20My%20Brain">Wrack My Brain</a>", a 1981 US top 40 hit written and produced by Harrison, and guitar overdubs to two tracks on "<a href="Vertical%20Man">Vertical Man</a>" (1998). In 1996 Harrison recorded "Distance Makes No Difference With Love" with Carl Perkins for the latter's album "<a href="Go%20Cat%20Go%21">Go Cat Go!</a>", and in 1990 he played slide guitar on the title track of Dylan's "<a href="Under%20the%20Red%20Sky">Under the Red Sky</a>" album. In 2001 he performed as a guest musician on Jeff Lynne and Electric Light Orchestra's comeback album "<a href="Zoom%20%28Electric%20Light%20Orchestra%20album%29">Zoom</a>", and on the song "Love Letters" for <a href="Bill%20Wyman%27s%20Rhythm%20Kings">Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings</a>. He also co-wrote a new song with his son Dhani, "<a href="Horse%20to%20the%20Water">Horse to the Water</a>", which was recorded on 2 October, eight weeks before his death. It appeared on <a href="Jools%20Holland">Jools Holland</a>'s album "Small World, Big Band".

When Harrison joined the Quarrymen in 1958 his main guitar was a <a href="H%C3%B6fner">Höfner</a> President Acoustic, which he soon traded for a Höfner Club 40 model. His first solid-body electric guitar was a Czech-built <a href="Jolana">Jolana</a> Futurama/Grazioso. The guitars he used on early recordings were mainly <a href="Gretsch">Gretsch</a> models, played through a <a href="Vox%20AC30">Vox amplifier</a>, including a <a href="Gretsch%206128">Gretsch Duo Jet</a> that he bought secondhand in 1961, and posed with on the album cover for "Cloud Nine". He also bought a Gretsch Tennessean and a Gretsch Country Gentleman, which he played on "<a href="She%20Loves%20You">She Loves You</a>", and during the Beatles' 1964 appearance on "<a href="The%20Ed%20Sullivan%20Show">The Ed Sullivan Show</a>". In 1963 he bought a <a href="Rickenbacker%20400%20series">Rickenbacker 425</a> Fireglo, and in 1964 he acquired a Rickenbacker 360/12 guitar, which was the second of its kind to be manufactured. Harrison obtained his first <a href="Fender%20Stratocaster">Fender Stratocaster</a> in 1965 and first used it during the recording of the "Help!" album that February; he also used it when recording "Rubber Soul" later that year, most notably on the song "<a href="Nowhere%20Man%20%28song%29">Nowhere Man</a>".

In early 1966 Harrison and Lennon each purchased <a href="Epiphone%20Casino">Epiphone Casino</a>s, which they used on "Revolver". Harrison also used a <a href="Gibson%20J-160E">Gibson J-160E</a> and a <a href="Gibson%20SG">Gibson SG</a> Standard while recording the album. He later painted his Stratocaster in a psychedelic design that included the word "<a href="Be-Bop-A-Lula">Bebopalula</a>" above the pickguard and the guitar's nickname, "Rocky", on the headstock. He played this guitar in the "<a href="Magical%20Mystery%20Tour%20%28film%29">Magical Mystery Tour</a>" film and throughout his solo career. In July 1968, Clapton gave him a <a href="Gibson%20Les%20Paul">Gibson Les Paul</a>, which Harrison nicknamed "<a href="Lucy%20%28guitar%29">Lucy</a>". Around this time, he obtained a Gibson Jumbo J-200 acoustic guitar, which he subsequently gave to Dylan to use at the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight%20Festival%201969">1969 Isle of Wight Festival</a>. In late 1968 <a href="Fender%20Musical%20Instruments%20Corporation">Fender Musical Instruments Corporation</a> gave Harrison a custom-made <a href="Fender%20Telecaster">Fender Telecaster</a> Rosewood prototype, made especially for him by Philip Kubicki. In August 2017, Fender released a "Limited Edition George Harrison Rosewood Telecaster" modelled after a Telecaster that <a href="Roger%20Rossmeisl">Roger Rossmeisl</a> originally created for Harrison.

Harrison helped finance Ravi Shankar's documentary "<a href="Raga%20%28film%29">Raga</a>" and released it through <a href="Apple%20Films">Apple Films</a> in 1971. He also produced, with Apple manager <a href="Allen%20Klein">Allen Klein</a>, the "Concert for Bangladesh" film. In 1973, he produced the feature film "<a href="Little%20Malcolm">Little Malcolm</a>", but the project was lost amid the litigation surrounding the former Beatles ending their business ties with Klein.

In 1973 <a href="Peter%20Sellers">Peter Sellers</a> introduced Harrison to <a href="Denis%20O%27Brien%20%28producer%29">Denis O'Brien</a>. Soon after, the two went into business together. In 1978, in an effort to produce "<a href="Monty%20Python%27s%20Life%20of%20Brian">Monty Python's Life of Brian</a>", they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films. Their opportunity for investment came after <a href="EMI%20Films">EMI Films</a> withdrew funding at the demand of their chief executive, <a href="Bernard%20Delfont">Bernard Delfont</a>. Harrison financed the production of "Life of Brian" in part by mortgaging his home, which Idle later called "the most anybody's ever paid for a cinema ticket in history". The film grossed $21 million at the box office in the US. The first film distributed by HandMade Films was "<a href="The%20Long%20Good%20Friday">The Long Good Friday</a>" (1980), and the first they produced was "<a href="Time%20Bandits">Time Bandits</a>" (1981), a co-scripted project by <a href="Monty%20Python">Monty Python</a>s <a href="Terry%20Gilliam">Terry Gilliam</a> and <a href="Michael%20Palin">Michael Palin</a>. The film featured a new song by Harrison, "<a href="Dream%20Away%20%28George%20Harrison%20song%29">Dream Away</a>", in the closing credits. "Time Bandits" became one of HandMade's most successful and acclaimed efforts; with a budget of $5 million, it earned $35 million in the US within ten weeks of its release.

Harrison served as <a href="Film%20producer">executive producer</a> for 23 films with HandMade, including "<a href="A%20Private%20Function">A Private Function</a>", "<a href="Mona%20Lisa%20%281986%20film%29">Mona Lisa</a>", "<a href="Shanghai%20Surprise">Shanghai Surprise</a>", "<a href="Withnail%20and%20I">Withnail and I</a>" and "<a href="How%20to%20Get%20Ahead%20in%20Advertising">How to Get Ahead in Advertising</a>". He made <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo appearance</a>s in several of these films, including a role as a <a href="nightclub%20singer">nightclub singer</a> in "Shanghai Surprise", for which he recorded five new songs. According to Ian Inglis, Harrison's "executive role in HandMade Films helped to sustain British cinema at a time of crisis, producing some of the country's most memorable movies of the 1980s." Following a series of <a href="box%20office%20bomb">box office bomb</a>s in the late 1980s, and excessive debt incurred by O'Brien which was <a href="loan%20guarantee">guaranteed</a> by Harrison, HandMade's financial situation became precarious. The company ceased operations in 1991 and was sold three years later to Paragon Entertainment, a Canadian corporation. Afterwards, Harrison sued O'Brien for $25 million for fraud and negligence, resulting in an $11.6 million judgement in 1996.

Harrison was involved in humanitarian and political activism throughout his life. In the 1960s, the Beatles supported the <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights movement</a> and protested against the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. In early 1971, Ravi Shankar consulted Harrison about how to provide aid to the people of Bangladesh after the <a href="1970%20Bhola%20cyclone">1970 Bhola cyclone</a> and the <a href="Bangladesh%20Liberation%20War">Bangladesh Liberation War</a>. Harrison hastily wrote and recorded the song "<a href="Bangla%20Desh%20%28song%29">Bangla Desh</a>", which became pop music's first <a href="charity%20single">charity single</a> when issued by Apple Records in late July. He also pushed Apple to release Shankar's "<a href="Joi%20Bangla">Joi Bangla</a>" EP in an effort to raise further awareness for the cause.<ref name="Dooley/Gibson"></ref> Shankar asked for Harrison's advice about planning a small charity event in the US. Harrison responded by organising the Concert for Bangladesh, which raised more than $240,000. Around $13.5 million was generated through the album and film releases, although most of the funds were frozen in an <a href="Internal%20Revenue%20Service">Internal Revenue Service</a> audit for ten years, due to Klein's failure to register the event as a <a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> benefit beforehand. In June 1972, UNICEF honoured Harrison and Shankar, and Klein, with the "Child Is the Father of Man" award at an annual ceremony in recognition of their fundraising efforts for Bangladesh.

From 1980, Harrison became a vocal supporter of <a href="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a> and <a href="CND">CND</a>. He also protested against the use of nuclear energy with <a href="Friends%20of%20the%20Earth">Friends of the Earth</a>, and helped finance "<a href="Vole%20%28magazine%29">Vole</a>", a <a href="Green%20politics">green</a> magazine launched by Monty Python member <a href="Terry%20Jones">Terry Jones</a>. In 1990, he helped promote his wife Olivia's <a href="Romanian%20Angel%20Appeal">Romanian Angel Appeal</a> on behalf of the thousands of <a href="Romanian%20orphans">Romanian orphans</a> left abandoned by the state following the <a href="fall%20of%20Communism">fall of Communism</a> in Eastern Europe. Harrison recorded a benefit single, "<a href="Nobody%27s%20Child%20%28song%29">Nobody's Child</a>", with the Traveling Wilburys, and assembled a fundraising album with contributions from other artists including Clapton, Starr, <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a>, <a href="Stevie%20Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href="Donovan">Donovan</a> and <a href="Van%20Morrison">Van Morrison</a>.

The Concert for Bangladesh has been described as an innovative precursor for the large-scale charity rock shows that followed, including <a href="Live%20Aid">Live Aid</a>. The George Harrison Humanitarian Fund for UNICEF, a joint effort between the Harrison family and the <a href="U.S.%20Fund%20for%20UNICEF">US Fund for UNICEF</a>, aims to support programmes that help children caught in humanitarian emergencies. In December 2007, they donated $450,000 to help the victims of <a href="Cyclone%20Sidr">Cyclone Sidr</a> in Bangladesh. On 13 October 2009, the first George Harrison Humanitarian Award went to Ravi Shankar for his efforts in saving the lives of children, and his involvement with the Concert for Bangladesh.

By the mid-1960s Harrison had become an admirer of <a href="Culture%20of%20India">Indian culture</a> and mysticism, introducing it to the other Beatles. During the filming of "<a href="Help%21%20%28film%29">Help!</a>" in the Bahamas, they met the founder of <a href="Sivananda%20Yoga">Sivananda Yoga</a>, <a href="Vishnudevananda%20Saraswati">Swami Vishnu-devananda</a>, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, "The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga". Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the "Sgt Pepper" recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several <a href="guru">guru</a>s, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to <a href="Rishikesh">Rishikesh</a> in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with <a href="Maharishi%20Mahesh%20Yogi">Maharishi Mahesh Yogi</a>. Harrison's use of <a href="psychedelic%20drug">psychedelic drug</a>s encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: "For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had <a href="Lysergic%20acid%20diethylamide">acid</a>, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music."

In line with the Hindu <a href="yoga">yoga</a> tradition, Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s. After being given various religious texts by Shankar in 1966, he remained a lifelong advocate of the teachings of <a href="Swami%20Vivekananda">Swami Vivekananda</a> and <a href="Paramahansa%20Yogananda">Paramahansa Yogananda</a> – yogis and authors, respectively, of "<a href="Raja%20Yoga%20%28book%29">Raja Yoga</a>" and "<a href="Autobiography%20of%20a%20Yogi">Autobiography of a Yogi</a>". In mid-1969, he produced the single "<a href="Hare%20Krishna%20Mantra%20%28song%29">Hare Krishna Mantra</a>", performed by members of the London <a href="Radha%20Krishna%20Temple">Radha Krishna Temple</a>. Having also helped the Temple devotees become established in Britain, Harrison then met their leader, <a href="A.C.%20Bhaktivedanta%20Swami%20Prabhupada">A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada</a>, whom he described as "my friend ... my master" and "a perfect example of everything he preached". Harrison embraced the Hare Krishna tradition, particularly "<a href="Japa">japa-yoga</a>" chanting with beads, and became a lifelong devotee.

Regarding other faiths he once remarked: "All religions are branches of one big tree. It doesn't matter what you call Him just as long as you call." He commented on his beliefs:

Before his religious conversion, the only British performer known for similar activities had been <a href="Cliff%20Richard">Cliff Richard</a>, whose conversion to Christianity in 1966 had gone largely unnoticed by the public. "By contrast," wrote Inglis, "Harrison's spiritual journey was seen as a serious and important development that reflected popular music's increasing maturity ... what he, and the Beatles, had managed to overturn was the paternalistic assumption that popular musicians had no role other than to stand on stage and sing their hit songs."

Harrison married model <a href="Pattie%20Boyd">Pattie Boyd</a> on 21 January 1966, with McCartney serving as <a href="Groomsman%23Best%20man">best man</a>. Harrison and Boyd had met in 1964 during the production of the film "A Hard Day's Night", in which the 19-year-old Boyd had been cast as a schoolgirl. They separated in 1974 and their divorce was finalised in 1977. Boyd said her decision to end the marriage was due largely to George's repeated infidelities. The last infidelity culminated in an affair with Ringo's wife <a href="Maureen%20Starkey%20Tigrett">Maureen</a>, which Boyd called "the final straw". She characterised the last year of their marriage as "fuelled by alcohol and cocaine", and she stated: "George used coke excessively, and I think it changed him ... it froze his emotions and hardened his heart." She subsequently moved in with <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a>, and they married in 1979.

Harrison married Dark Horse Records' secretary <a href="Olivia%20Harrison">Olivia Trinidad Arias</a> on 2 September 1978. They had met at the <a href="A%26amp%3BM%20Records">A&M Records</a> offices in Los Angeles in 1974, and together had one son, <a href="Dhani%20Harrison">Dhani Harrison</a>, born on 1 August 1978.

He restored the English manor house and grounds of Friar Park, his home in <a href="Henley-on-Thames">Henley-on-Thames</a>, where several of his music videos were filmed including "<a href="Crackerbox%20Palace">Crackerbox Palace</a>"; the grounds also served as the background for the cover of "All Things Must Pass". He employed ten workers to maintain the garden. Harrison commented on gardening as a form of <a href="escapism">escapism</a>: "Sometimes I feel like I'm actually on the wrong planet, and it's great when I'm in my garden, but the minute I go out the gate I think: 'What the hell am I doing here?'" His autobiography, "<a href="I%2C%20Me%2C%20Mine%20%28book%29">I, Me, Mine</a>", is dedicated "to gardeners everywhere". The former Beatles publicist <a href="Derek%20Taylor">Derek Taylor</a> helped Harrison write the book, which said little about the Beatles, focusing instead on Harrison's hobbies, music and lyrics. Taylor commented: "George is not disowning the Beatles ... but it was a long time ago and actually a short part of his life."

Harrison had an interest in <a href="sports%20car">sports car</a>s and <a href="Motorsport">motor racing</a>; he was one of the 100 people who purchased the <a href="McLaren%20F1">McLaren F1</a> road car. He had collected photos of racing drivers and their cars since he was young; at 12 he had attended his first race, the <a href="1955%20British%20Grand%20Prix">1955 British Grand Prix</a> at <a href="Aintree%20Racecourse%23Motor%20racing">Aintree</a>. He wrote "<a href="Faster%20%28George%20Harrison%20song%29">Faster</a>" as a tribute to the <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> racing drivers <a href="Jackie%20Stewart">Jackie Stewart</a> and <a href="Ronnie%20Peterson">Ronnie Peterson</a>. Proceeds from its release went to the <a href="Gunnar%20Nilsson">Gunnar Nilsson</a> cancer charity, set up after the Swedish driver's death from the disease in 1978. Harrison's first extravagant car, a 1964 <a href="Aston%20Martin%20DB5">Aston Martin DB5</a>, was sold at auction on 7 December 2011 in London. An anonymous Beatles collector paid £350,000 for the vehicle that Harrison had bought new in January 1965.

For most of the Beatles' career the relationships in the group were close. According to <a href="Hunter%20Davies">Hunter Davies</a>, "the Beatles spent their lives not living a communal life, but communally living the same life. They were each other's greatest friends." Harrison's ex-wife Pattie Boyd described how the Beatles "all belonged to each other" and admitted, "George has a lot with the others that I can never know about. Nobody, not even the wives, can break through or even comprehend it." Starr said, "We really looked out for each other and we had so many laughs together. In the old days we'd have the biggest hotel suites, the whole floor of the hotel, and the four of us would end up in the bathroom, just to be with each other". He added, "there were some really loving, caring moments between four people: a hotel room here and there – a really amazing closeness. Just four guys who loved each other. It was pretty sensational."

Lennon stated that his relationship with Harrison was "one of young follower and older guy ... [he] was like a disciple of mine when we started." The two later bonded over their <a href="Lysergic%20acid%20diethylamide">LSD</a> experiences, finding common ground as seekers of spirituality. They took radically different paths thereafter, Harrison finding God and Lennon coming to the conclusion that people are the creators of their own lives. In 1974 Harrison said of his former bandmate: "John Lennon is a saint and he's heavy-duty, and he's great and I love him. But at the same time, he's such a "bastard" – but that's the great thing about him, you see?"

Harrison and McCartney were the first of the Beatles to meet, having shared a school bus, and often learned and rehearsed new guitar chords together. McCartney stated that he and Harrison usually shared a bedroom while touring. McCartney has referred to Harrison as his "baby brother". In a 1974 BBC radio interview with <a href="Alan%20Freeman">Alan Freeman</a>, Harrison stated: "[McCartney] ruined me as a guitar player". Perhaps the most significant obstacle to a Beatles reunion after the death of Lennon was Harrison and McCartney's personal relationship, as both men admitted that they often got on each other's nerves. Rodriguez commented: "Even to the end of George's days, theirs was a volatile relationship".

In <a href="1965%20Birthday%20Honours">June 1965</a>, Harrison and the other Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (<a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">MBE</a>). They received their insignia from <a href="Elizabeth%20II">the Queen</a> at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October. In 1971 the Beatles received an <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> for the best <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Score">Original Song Score</a> for the film "<a href="Let%20It%20Be%20%281970%20film%29">Let It Be</a>". The minor planet <a href="4149%20Harrison">4149 Harrison</a>, discovered in 1984, was named after him, as was a variety of <a href="Dahlia">Dahlia</a> flower. In December 1992 he became the first recipient of the <a href="Billboard%20Music%20Award">Billboard Century Award</a>, an honour presented to music artists for significant bodies of work. The award recognised Harrison's "critical role in laying the groundwork for the modern concept of <a href="world%20music">world music</a>" and for his having "advanced society's comprehension of the spiritual and altruistic power of popular music". "Rolling Stone" magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".

In 2002, on the first anniversary of his death, the <a href="Concert%20for%20George">Concert for George</a> was held at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>. Eric Clapton organised the event, which included performances by many of Harrison's friends and musical collaborators, including McCartney and Starr. Eric Idle, who described Harrison as "one of the few morally good people that rock and roll has produced", was among the performers of Monty Python's "<a href="The%20Lumberjack%20Song">Lumberjack Song</a>". The profits from the concert went to Harrison's charity, the <a href="Material%20World%20Charitable%20Foundation">Material World Charitable Foundation</a>.

In 2004, Harrison was posthumously inducted into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> as a solo artist by his former bandmates Lynne and Petty, and into the Madison Square Garden Walk of Fame in 2006 for the Concert for Bangladesh. On 14 April 2009, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded Harrison a star on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Walk of Fame</a> in front of the <a href="Capitol%20Records%20Building">Capitol Records Building</a>. McCartney, Lynne and Petty were present when the star was unveiled. Harrison's widow Olivia, the actor <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a> and Idle made speeches at the ceremony, and Harrison's son Dhani spoke the Hare Krishna mantra.

A documentary film entitled "", directed by <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>, was released in October 2011. The film features interviews with Olivia and Dhani Harrison, Klaus Voormann, <a href="Terry%20Gilliam">Terry Gilliam</a>, Starr, Clapton, McCartney, Keltner and <a href="Astrid%20Kirchherr">Astrid Kirchherr</a>.

Harrison was posthumously honoured with <a href="The%20Recording%20Academy">The Recording Academy</a>'s <a href="Grammy%20Lifetime%20Achievement%20Award">Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award</a> at the <a href="Grammy%20Awards">Grammy Awards</a> in February 2015.

George Bernard Shaw

George Bernard Shaw (26 July 1856 –  2 November 1950), known at his insistence simply as Bernard Shaw, was an Irish playwright, critic, <a href="polemic">polemic</a>ist and political activist. His influence on Western theatre, culture and politics extended from the 1880s to his death and beyond. He wrote more than sixty plays, including major works such as "<a href="Man%20and%20Superman">Man and Superman</a>" (1902), "<a href="Pygmalion%20%28play%29">Pygmalion</a>" (1912)" and <a href="Saint%20Joan%20%28play%29">Saint Joan</a>" (1923). With a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory, Shaw became the leading dramatist of his generation, and in 1925 was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a>.

Born in Dublin, Shaw moved to London in 1876, where he struggled to establish himself as a writer and novelist, and embarked on a rigorous process of self-education. By the mid-1880s he had become a respected theatre and music critic. Following a political awakening, he joined the <a href="gradualism%23Politics%20and%20society">gradualist</a> <a href="Fabian%20Society">Fabian Society</a> and became its most prominent pamphleteer. Shaw had been writing plays for years before his first public success, "<a href="Arms%20and%20the%20Man">Arms and the Man</a>" in 1894. Influenced by <a href="Henrik%20Ibsen">Henrik Ibsen</a>, he sought to introduce a new realism into English-language drama, using his plays as vehicles to disseminate his political, social and religious ideas. By the early twentieth century his reputation as a dramatist was secured with a series of critical and popular successes that included "<a href="Major%20Barbara">Major Barbara</a>", "<a href="The%20Doctor%27s%20Dilemma%20%28play%29">The Doctor's Dilemma</a>" and "<a href="Caesar%20and%20Cleopatra%20%28play%29">Caesar and Cleopatra</a>".

Shaw's expressed views were often contentious; he promoted <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a> and alphabet reform, and opposed <a href="vaccination">vaccination</a> and organised religion. He courted unpopularity by denouncing both sides in the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> as equally culpable, and although not a <a href="Irish%20republicanism">republican</a>, castigated British policy on Ireland in the postwar period. These stances had no lasting effect on his standing or productivity as a dramatist; the inter-war years saw a series of often ambitious plays, which achieved varying degrees of popular success. In 1938 he provided the screenplay for a filmed version of "Pygmalion" for which he received an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Adapted%20Screenplay">Academy Award</a>. His appetite for politics and controversy remained undiminished; by the late 1920s he had largely renounced <a href="Fabian%20Society">Fabian Society</a> gradualism and often wrote and spoke favourably of dictatorships of the right and left—he expressed admiration for both <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Mussolini</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Stalin</a>. In the final decade of his life he made fewer public statements, but continued to write prolifically until shortly before his death, aged ninety-four, having refused all state honours, including the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">Order of Merit</a> in 1946.

Since Shaw's death scholarly and critical opinion has varied about his works, but he has regularly been rated as second only to <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> among British dramatists; analysts recognise his extensive influence on generations of English-language playwrights. The word "Shavian" has entered the language as encapsulating Shaw's ideas and his means of expressing them.

Shaw was born at 3 Upper Synge Street in <a href="Portobello%2C%20Dublin">Portobello</a>, a lower-middle-class part of <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>. He was the youngest child and only son of George Carr Shaw (1814–1885) and Lucinda Elizabeth (Bessie) Shaw ("née" Gurly; 1830–1913). His elder siblings were Lucinda (Lucy) Frances (1853–1920) and Elinor Agnes (1855–1876). The Shaw family was of <a href="Anglo-Irish%20people">English descent</a> and belonged to the dominant <a href="Protestant%20Ascendancy">Protestant Ascendancy</a> in Ireland; George Carr Shaw, an ineffectual alcoholic, was among the family's less successful members. His relatives secured him a <a href="sinecure">sinecure</a> in the civil service, from which he was pensioned off in the early 1850s; thereafter he worked irregularly as a corn merchant. In 1852 he married Bessie Gurly; in the view of Shaw's biographer <a href="Michael%20Holroyd">Michael Holroyd</a> she married to escape a tyrannical great-aunt. If, as Holroyd and others surmise, George's motives were mercenary, then he was disappointed, as Bessie brought him little of her family's money. She came to despise her ineffectual and often drunken husband, with whom she shared what their son later described as a life of "shabby-genteel poverty".

By the time of Shaw's birth, his mother had become close to George John Lee, a flamboyant figure well known in Dublin's musical circles. Shaw retained a lifelong obsession that Lee might have been his biological father; there is no consensus among <a href="wikt%3AShavian">Shavian</a> scholars on the likelihood of this. The young Shaw suffered no harshness from his mother, but he later recalled that her indifference and lack of affection hurt him deeply. He found solace in the music that abounded in the house. Lee was a conductor and teacher of singing; Bessie had a fine <a href="mezzo-soprano">mezzo-soprano</a> voice and was much influenced by Lee's unorthodox method of vocal production. The Shaws' house was often filled with music, with frequent gatherings of singers and players.

In 1862, Lee and the Shaws agreed to share a house, No. 1 Hatch Street, in an affluent part of Dublin, and a country cottage on <a href="Dalkey%20Hill">Dalkey Hill</a>, overlooking <a href="Killiney%20Bay">Killiney Bay</a>. Shaw, a sensitive boy, found the less salubrious parts of Dublin shocking and distressing, and was happier at the cottage. Lee's students often gave him books, which the young Shaw read avidly; thus, as well as gaining a thorough musical knowledge of choral and operatic works, he became familiar with a wide spectrum of literature.

Between 1865 and 1871, Shaw attended four schools, all of which he hated. His experiences as a schoolboy left him disillusioned with formal education: "Schools and schoolmasters", he later wrote, were "prisons and turnkeys in which children are kept to prevent them disturbing and chaperoning their parents." In October 1871 he left school to become a junior clerk in a Dublin firm of land agents, where he worked hard, and quickly rose to become head cashier. During this period, Shaw was known as "George Shaw"; after 1876, he dropped the "George" and styled himself "Bernard Shaw".

In June 1873, Lee left Dublin for London and never returned. A fortnight later, Bessie followed him; the two girls joined her. Shaw's explanation of why his mother followed Lee was that without the latter's financial contribution the joint household had to be broken up. Left in Dublin with his father, Shaw compensated for the absence of music in the house by teaching himself to play the piano.

Early in 1876 Shaw learned from his mother that Agnes was dying of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. He resigned from the land agents, and in March travelled to England to join his mother and Lucy at Agnes's funeral. He never again lived in Ireland, and did not visit it for twenty-nine years.
Initially, Shaw refused to seek clerical employment in London. His mother allowed him to live free of charge in her house in <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a>, but he nevertheless needed an income. He had abandoned a teenage ambition to become a painter, and had no thought yet of writing for a living, but Lee found a little work for him, <a href="ghostwriter">ghost-writing</a> a musical column printed under Lee's name in a satirical weekly, "The Hornet". Lee's relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London. Shaw maintained contact with Lee, who found him work as a rehearsal pianist and occasional singer.

Eventually Shaw was driven to applying for office jobs. In the interim he secured a reader's pass for the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> Reading Room (the forerunner of the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>) and spent most weekdays there, reading and writing. His first attempt at drama, begun in 1878, was a <a href="blank%20verse">blank-verse</a> satirical piece on a religious theme. It was abandoned unfinished, as was his first try at a novel. His first completed novel, "Immaturity" (1879), was too grim to appeal to publishers and did not appear until the 1930s. He was employed briefly by the newly formed Edison Telephone Company in 1879–80, and as in Dublin achieved rapid promotion. Nonetheless, when the <a href="National%20Telephone%20Company">Edison firm merged</a> with the rival Bell Telephone Company, Shaw chose not to seek a place in the new organisation. Thereafter he pursued a full-time career as an author.

For the next four years Shaw made a negligible income from writing, and was subsidised by his mother. In 1881, for the sake of economy, and increasingly as a matter of principle, he became a <a href="vegetarianism">vegetarian</a>. He grew a beard to hide a facial scar left by <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>. In rapid succession he wrote two more novels: "The Irrational Knot" (1880) and "Love Among the Artists" (1881), but neither found a publisher; each was <a href="serial%20%28literature%29">serialised</a> a few years later in the socialist magazine "Our Corner".

In 1880 Shaw began attending meetings of the Zetetical Society, whose objective was to "search for truth in all matters affecting the interests of the human race". Here he met <a href="Sidney%20Webb">Sidney Webb</a>, a junior civil servant who, like Shaw, was busy educating himself. Despite difference of style and temperament, the two quickly recognised qualities in each other and developed a lifelong friendship. Shaw later reflected: "You knew everything that I didn't know and I knew everything you didn't know ... We had everything to learn from one another and brains enough to do it".

Shaw's next attempt at drama was a one-act playlet in French, "Un Petit Drame", written in 1884 but not published in his lifetime. In the same year the critic <a href="William%20Archer%20%28critic%29">William Archer</a> suggested a collaboration, with a plot by Archer and dialogue by Shaw. The project foundered, but Shaw returned to the draft as the basis of "<a href="Widowers%27%20Houses">Widowers' Houses</a>" in 1892, and the connection with Archer proved of immense value to Shaw's career.

On 5 September 1882 Shaw attended a meeting at the Memorial Hall, <a href="Farringdon%2C%20London">Farringdon</a>, addressed by the political economist <a href="Henry%20George">Henry George</a>. Shaw then read George's book "<a href="Progress%20and%20Poverty">Progress and Poverty</a>", which awakened his interest in economics. He began attending meetings of the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Federation">Social Democratic Federation</a> (SDF), where he discovered the writings of <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a>, and thereafter spent much of 1883 reading "<a href="Das%20Kapital">Das Kapital</a>". He was not impressed by the SDF's founder, <a href="Henry%20Hyndman">H. M. Hyndman</a>, whom he found autocratic, ill-tempered and lacking leadership qualities. Shaw doubted the ability of the SDF to harness the working classes into an effective radical movement and did not join it—he preferred, he said, to work with his intellectual equals.

After reading a tract, "Why Are The Many Poor?", issued by the recently formed <a href="Fabian%20Society">Fabian Society</a>, Shaw went to the society's next advertised meeting, on 16 May 1884. He became a member in September, and before the year's end had provided the society with its first manifesto, published as Fabian Tract No. 2. He joined the society's executive committee in January 1885, and later that year recruited Webb and also <a href="Annie%20Besant">Annie Besant</a>, a fine orator.

From 1885 to 1889 Shaw attended the fortnightly meetings of the <a href="Royal%20Economic%20Society">British Economic Association</a>; it was, Holroyd observes, "the closest Shaw had ever come to university education." This experience changed his political ideas; he moved away from Marxism and became an apostle of <a href="Gradualism%23Politics%20and%20society">gradualism</a>. When in 1886–87 the Fabians debated whether to embrace <a href="anarchism">anarchism</a>, as advocated by <a href="Charlotte%20Wilson">Charlotte Wilson</a>, Besant and others, Shaw joined the majority in rejecting this approach. After a rally in <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a> addressed by Besant was violently broken up by the authorities on 13 November 1887 (<a href="Bloody%20Sunday%20%281887%29">"Bloody Sunday"</a>), Shaw became convinced of the folly of attempting to challenge police power. Thereafter he largely accepted the principle of "permeation" as advocated by Webb: the notion whereby socialism could best be achieved by infiltration of people and ideas into existing political parties.

Throughout the 1880s the Fabian Society remained small, its message of moderation frequently unheard among more strident voices. Its profile was raised in 1889 with the publication of "Fabian Essays in Socialism", edited by Shaw who also provided two of the essays. The second of these, "Transition", details the case for gradualism and permeation, asserting that "the necessity for cautious and gradual change must be obvious to everyone". In 1890 Shaw produced Tract No. 13, "What Socialism Is", a revision of an earlier tract in which Charlotte Wilson had defined socialism in anarchistic terms. In Shaw's new version, readers were assured that "socialism can be brought about in a perfectly constitutional manner by democratic institutions".

The mid-1880s marked a turning point in Shaw's life, both personally and professionally: he lost his virginity, had two novels published, and began a career as a critic. He had been celibate until his twenty-ninth birthday, when his shyness was overcome by Jane (Jenny) Patterson, a widow some years his senior. Their affair continued, not always smoothly, for eight years. Shaw's sex life has caused much speculation and debate among his biographers, but there is a consensus that the relationship with Patterson was one of his few non-platonic romantic liaisons.

The published novels, neither commercially successful, were his two final efforts in this genre: "Cashel Byron's Profession" written in 1882–83, and "An Unsocial Socialist", begun and finished in 1883. The latter was published as a serial in "ToDay" magazine in 1884, although it did not appear in book form until 1887. "Cashel Byron" appeared in magazine and book form in 1886.

In 1884 and 1885, through the influence of Archer, Shaw was engaged to write book and music criticism for London papers. When Archer resigned as art critic of "<a href="The%20World%20%28journal%29">The World</a>" in 1886 he secured the succession for Shaw. The two figures in the contemporary art world whose views Shaw most admired were <a href="William%20Morris">William Morris</a> and <a href="John%20Ruskin">John Ruskin</a>, and he sought to follow their precepts in his criticisms. Their emphasis on morality appealed to Shaw, who rejected the idea of <a href="art%20for%20art%27s%20sake">art for art's sake</a>, and insisted that all great art must be <a href="didacticism">didactic</a>.

Of Shaw's various reviewing activities in the 1880s and 1890s it was as a music critic that he was best known. After serving as deputy in 1888, he became musical critic of "<a href="The%20Star%20%28London%29">The Star</a>" in February 1889, writing under the pen-name Corno di Bassetto. In May 1890 he moved back to "The World", where he wrote a weekly column as "G.B.S." for more than four years. In the 2016 version of the "<a href="Grove%20Dictionary%20of%20Music%20and%20Musicians">Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</a>", Robert Anderson writes, "Shaw's collected writings on music stand alone in their mastery of English and compulsive readability." Shaw ceased to be a salaried music critic in August 1894, but published occasional articles on the subject throughout his career, his last in 1950.

From 1895 to 1898, Shaw was the theatre critic for "<a href="Saturday%20Review%20%28London%29">The Saturday Review</a>", edited by his friend <a href="Frank%20Harris">Frank Harris</a>. As at "The World", he used the by-line "G.B.S." He campaigned against the artificial conventions and hypocrisies of the <a href="Nineteenth-century%20theatre%23Theatre%20in%20Britain">Victorian theatre</a> and called for plays of real ideas and true characters. By this time he had embarked in earnest on a career as a playwright: "I had rashly taken up the case; and rather than let it collapse I manufactured the evidence".

After using the plot of the aborted 1884 collaboration with Archer to complete "Widowers' Houses" (it was staged twice in London, in December 1892), Shaw continued writing plays. At first he made slow progress; "<a href="The%20Philanderer">The Philanderer</a>", written in 1893 but not published until 1898, had to wait until 1905 for a stage production. Similarly, "<a href="Mrs%20Warren%27s%20Profession">Mrs Warren's Profession</a>" (1893) was written five years before publication and nine years before reaching the stage.
Shaw's first play to bring him financial success was "<a href="Arms%20and%20the%20Man">Arms and the Man</a>" (1894), a mock-<a href="Ruritania">Ruritania</a>n comedy satirising conventions of love, military honour and class. The press found the play overlong, and accused Shaw of mediocrity, sneering at heroism and patriotism, heartless cleverness, and copying <a href="W.%20S.%20Gilbert">W.S.Gilbert</a>'s style. The public took a different view, and the management of the theatre staged extra matinée performances to meet the demand. The play ran from April to July, toured the provinces and was staged in New York. It earned him £341 in royalties in its first year, a sufficient sum to enable him to give up his salaried post as a music critic. Among the cast of the London production was <a href="Florence%20Farr">Florence Farr</a>, with whom Shaw had a romantic relationship between 1890 and 1894, much resented by Jenny Patterson.

The success of "Arms and the Man" was not immediately replicated. "<a href="Candida%20%28play%29">Candida</a>", which presented a young woman making a conventional romantic choice for unconventional reasons, received a single performance in <a href="South%20Shields">South Shields</a> in 1895; in 1897 a playlet about Napoleon called "<a href="The%20Man%20of%20Destiny">The Man of Destiny</a>" had a single staging at <a href="Croydon">Croydon</a>. In the 1890s Shaw's plays were better known in print than on the <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> stage; his biggest success of the decade was in New York in 1897, when <a href="Richard%20Mansfield">Richard Mansfield</a>'s production of the historical melodrama "<a href="The%20Devil%27s%20Disciple">The Devil's Disciple</a>" earned the author more than £2,000 in royalties.

In January 1893, as a Fabian delegate, Shaw attended the Bradford conference which led to the foundation of the <a href="Independent%20Labour%20Party">Independent Labour Party</a>. He was sceptical about the new party, and scorned the likelihood that it could switch the allegiance of the working class from sport to politics. He persuaded the conference to adopt resolutions abolishing indirect taxation, and taxing unearned income "to extinction". Back in London, Shaw produced what <a href="Margaret%20Cole">Margaret Cole</a>, in her Fabian history, terms a "grand philippic" against the minority <a href="Liberal%20government%201892%E2%80%9395">Liberal administration</a> that had taken power in 1892. "To Your Tents, O Israel" excoriated the government for ignoring social issues and concentrating solely on <a href="Irish%20Home%20Rule%20movement">Irish Home Rule</a>, a matter Shaw declared of no relevance to socialism. In 1894 the Fabian Society received a substantial bequest from a sympathiser, Henry Hunt Hutchinson—Holroyd mentions £10,000. Webb, who chaired the board of trustees appointed to supervise the legacy, proposed to use most of it to found a school of economics and politics. Shaw demurred; he thought such a venture was contrary to the specified purpose of the legacy. He was eventually persuaded to support the proposal, and the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Economics%20and%20Political%20Science">London School of Economics and Political Science</a> (LSE) opened in the summer of 1895.

By the later 1890s Shaw's political activities lessened as he concentrated on making his name as a dramatist. In 1897 he was persuaded to fill an uncontested vacancy for a "vestryman" (<a href="Parish%20councils%20in%20England">parish councillor</a>) in London's <a href="St%20Pancras%2C%20London">St Pancras</a> district. At least initially, Shaw took to his municipal responsibilities seriously; when London government was reformed in 1899 and the St Pancras vestry became the <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20St%20Pancras">Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras</a>, he was elected to the newly formed borough council.

In 1898, as a result of overwork, Shaw's health broke down. He was nursed by <a href="Charlotte%20Payne-Townshend">Charlotte Payne-Townshend</a>, a rich Anglo-Irish woman whom he had met through the Webbs. The previous year she had proposed that she and Shaw should marry. He had declined, but when she insisted on nursing him in a house in the country, Shaw, concerned that this might cause scandal, agreed to their marriage. The ceremony took place on 1 June 1898, in the <a href="register%20office">register office</a> in <a href="Covent%20Garden">Covent Garden</a>. The bride and bridegroom were both aged forty-one. In the view of the biographer and critic <a href="St%20John%20Greer%20Ervine">St John Ervine</a>, "their life together was entirely felicitous". There were no children of the marriage, which it is generally believed was never consummated; whether this was wholly at Charlotte's wish, as Shaw liked to suggest, is less widely credited. In the early weeks of the marriage Shaw was much occupied writing his Marxist analysis of <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>'s <a href="Der%20Ring%20des%20Nibelungen">"Ring" cycle</a>, published as "<a href="The%20Perfect%20Wagnerite">The Perfect Wagnerite</a>" late in 1898. In 1906 the Shaws found a country home in <a href="Ayot%20St%20Lawrence">Ayot St Lawrence</a>, Hertfordshire; they renamed the house "<a href="Shaw%27s%20Corner">Shaw's Corner</a>", and lived there for the rest of their lives. They retained a London flat in the <a href="Adelphi%20Terrace">Adelphi</a> and later at <a href="Whitehall%20Court">Whitehall Court</a>.

During the first decade of the twentieth century, Shaw secured a firm reputation as a playwright. In 1904 <a href="John%20Eugene%20Vedrenne">J. E. Vedrenne</a> and <a href="Harley%20Granville-Barker">Harley Granville-Barker</a> established a company at the <a href="Royal%20Court%20Theatre">Royal Court Theatre</a> in <a href="Sloane%20Square">Sloane Square</a>, <a href="Chelsea%2C%20London">Chelsea</a> to present modern drama. Over the next five years they staged fourteen of Shaw's plays. The first, "<a href="John%20Bull%27s%20Other%20Island">John Bull's Other Island</a>", a comedy about an Englishman in Ireland, attracted leading politicians and was seen by <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>, who laughed so much that he broke his chair. The play was withheld from Dublin's <a href="Abbey%20Theatre">Abbey Theatre</a>, for fear of the affront it might provoke, although it was shown at the city's Royal Theatre in November 1907. Shaw later wrote that <a href="William%20Butler%20Yeats">William Butler Yeats</a>, who had requested the play, "got rather more than he bargained for... It was uncongenial to the whole spirit of the neo-Gaelic movement, which is bent on creating a new Ireland after its own ideal, whereas my play is a very uncompromising presentment of the real old Ireland." Nonetheless, Shaw and Yeats were close friends; Yeats and <a href="Augusta%2C%20Lady%20Gregory">Lady Gregory</a> tried unsuccessfully to persuade Shaw to take up the vacant co-directorship of the Abbey Theatre after <a href="J.%20M.%20Synge">J. M. Synge</a>'s death in 1909. Shaw admired other figures in the <a href="Irish%20Literary%20Revival">Irish Literary Revival</a>, including <a href="George%20William%20Russell">George Russell</a> and <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>, and was a close friend of <a href="Se%C3%A1n%20O%27Casey">Seán O'Casey</a>, who was inspired to become a playwright after reading "John Bull's Other Island".

"<a href="Man%20and%20Superman">Man and Superman</a>", completed in 1902, was a success both at the Royal Court in 1905 and in <a href="Robert%20Loraine">Robert Loraine</a>'s New York production in the same year. Among the other Shaw works presented by Vedrenne and Granville-Barker were "<a href="Major%20Barbara">Major Barbara</a>" (1905), depicting the contrasting morality of arms manufacturers and the <a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a>; "<a href="The%20Doctor%27s%20Dilemma%20%28play%29">The Doctor's Dilemma</a>" (1906), a mostly serious piece about professional ethics; and "<a href="Caesar%20and%20Cleopatra%20%28play%29">Caesar and Cleopatra</a>", Shaw's counterblast to Shakespeare's "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>", seen in New York in 1906 and in London the following year.

Now prosperous and established, Shaw experimented with unorthodox theatrical forms described by his biographer <a href="Stanley%20Weintraub">Stanley Weintraub</a> as "discussion drama" and "serious <a href="farce">farce</a>". These plays included "<a href="Getting%20Married">Getting Married</a>" (premiered 1908), "<a href="The%20Shewing-Up%20of%20Blanco%20Posnet">The Shewing-Up of Blanco Posnet</a>" (1909), "<a href="Misalliance">Misalliance</a>" (1910), and "<a href="Fanny%27s%20First%20Play">Fanny's First Play</a>" (1911). "Blanco Posnet" was banned on religious grounds by the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain%23Theatre%20censorship">Lord Chamberlain</a> (the official theatre censor in England), and was produced instead in Dublin; it filled the Abbey Theatre to capacity. "Fanny's First Play", a comedy about <a href="suffragette">suffragette</a>s, had the longest initial run of any Shaw play—622 performances.

"<a href="Androcles%20and%20the%20Lion%20%28play%29">Androcles and the Lion</a>" (1912), a less heretical study of true and false religious attitudes than "Blanco Posnet", ran for eight weeks in September and October 1913. It was followed by one of Shaw's most successful plays, "<a href="Pygmalion%20%28play%29">Pygmalion</a>", written in 1912 and staged in Vienna the following year, and in Berlin shortly afterwards. Shaw commented, "It is the custom of the English press when a play of mine is produced, to inform the world that it is not a play—that it is dull, blasphemous, unpopular, and financially unsuccessful. ... Hence arose an urgent demand on the part of the managers of Vienna and Berlin that I should have my plays performed by them first." The British production opened in April 1914, starring <a href="Herbert%20Beerbohm%20Tree">Sir Herbert Tree</a> and <a href="Mrs%20Patrick%20Campbell">Mrs Patrick Campbell</a> as, respectively, a professor of phonetics and a <a href="cockney">cockney</a> flower-girl. There had earlier been a romantic liaison between Shaw and Campbell that caused Charlotte Shaw considerable concern, but by the time of the London premiere it had ended. The play attracted capacity audiences until July, when Tree insisted on going on holiday, and the production closed. His co-star then toured with the piece in the US.

In 1899, when the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Boer War</a> began, Shaw wished the Fabians to take a neutral stance on what he deemed, like <a href="Irish%20Home%20Rule%20movement">Home Rule</a>, to be a "non-Socialist" issue. Others, including the future Labour prime minister <a href="Ramsay%20MacDonald">Ramsay MacDonald</a>, wanted unequivocal opposition, and resigned from the society when it followed Shaw. In the Fabians' war manifesto, "Fabianism and the Empire" (1900), Shaw declared that "until the Federation of the World becomes an accomplished fact we must accept the most responsible Imperial federations available as a substitute for it".

As the new century began, Shaw became increasingly disillusioned by the limited impact of the Fabians on national politics. Thus, although a nominated Fabian delegate, he did not attend the London conference at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street in February 1900, that created the <a href="Labour%20Representation%20Committee%20%281900%29">Labour Representation Committee</a>—precursor of the modern <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a>. By 1903, when his term as borough councillor expired, he had lost his earlier enthusiasm, writing: "After six years of Borough Councilling I am convinced that the borough councils should be abolished". Nevertheless, in 1904 he stood in the <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a> elections. After an eccentric campaign, which Holroyd characterises as "[making] absolutely certain of not getting in", he was duly defeated. It was Shaw's final foray into electoral politics. Nationally, the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201906">1906 general election</a> produced a huge Liberal majority and an intake of 29 Labour members. Shaw viewed this outcome with scepticism; he had a low opinion of the new prime minister, <a href="Henry%20Campbell-Bannerman">Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman</a>, and saw the Labour members as inconsequential: "I apologise to the Universe for my connection with such a body".

In the years after the 1906 election, Shaw felt that the Fabians needed fresh leadership, and saw this in the form of his fellow-writer <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>, who had joined the society in February 1903. Wells's ideas for reform—particularly his proposals for closer cooperation with the Independent Labour Party—placed him at odds with the society's "Old Gang", led by Shaw. According to Cole, Wells "had minimal capacity for putting [his ideas] across in public meetings against Shaw's trained and practised virtuosity". In Shaw's view, "the Old Gang did not extinguish Mr Wells, he annihilated himself". Wells resigned from the society in September 1908; Shaw remained a member, but left the executive in April 1911. He later wondered whether the Old Gang should have given way to Wells some years earlier: "God only knows whether the Society had not better have done it". Although less active—he blamed his advancing years—Shaw remained a Fabian.

In 1912 Shaw invested £1,000 for a one-fifth share in the Webbs' new publishing venture, a socialist weekly magazine called "<a href="New%20Statesman">The New Statesman</a>", which appeared in April 1913. He became a founding director, publicist, and in due course a contributor, mostly anonymously. He was soon at odds with the magazine's editor, <a href="Clifford%20Sharp">Clifford Sharp</a>, who by 1916 was rejecting his contributions—"the only paper in the world that refuses to print anything by me", according to Shaw.

After the First World War began in August 1914, Shaw produced his tract "Common Sense About the War", which argued that the warring nations were equally culpable. Such a view was anathema in an atmosphere of fervent patriotism, and offended many of Shaw's friends; Ervine records that "[h]is appearance at any public function caused the instant departure of many of those present."

Despite his errant reputation, Shaw's propagandist skills were recognised by the British authorities, and early in 1917 he was invited by <a href="Douglas%20Haig%2C%201st%20Earl%20Haig">Field Marshal Haig</a> to visit the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> battlefields. Shaw's 10,000-word report, which emphasised the human aspects of the soldier's life, was well received, and he became less of a lone voice. In April 1917 he joined the national consensus in welcoming <a href="United%20States%20in%20World%20War%20I">America's entry</a> into the war: "a first class moral asset to the common cause against <a href="Prussian%20virtues">junkerism</a>".

Three short plays by Shaw were premiered during the war. "<a href="The%20Inca%20of%20Perusalem">The Inca of Perusalem</a>", written in 1915, encountered problems with the censor for burlesquing not only the enemy but the British military command; it was performed in 1916 at the <a href="Birmingham%20Repertory%20Theatre">Birmingham Repertory Theatre</a>. "<a href="O%27Flaherty%20V.C.">O'Flaherty V.C.</a>", satirising the government's attitude to Irish recruits, was banned in the UK and was presented at a <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> base in Belgium in 1917. "<a href="Augustus%20Does%20His%20Bit">Augustus Does His Bit</a>", a genial farce, was granted a licence; it opened at the Royal Court in January 1917.

Shaw had long supported the principle of Irish Home Rule within the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> (which he thought should become the British Commonwealth).
In April 1916 he wrote scathingly in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" about militant Irish nationalism: "In point of learning nothing and forgetting nothing these fellow-patriots of mine leave the Bourbons nowhere." Total independence, he asserted, was impractical; alliance with a bigger power (preferably England) was essential. The Dublin <a href="Easter%20Rising">Easter Rising</a> later that month took him by surprise. After its suppression by British forces, he expressed horror at the summary execution of the rebel leaders, but continued to believe in some form of Anglo-Irish union. In "How to Settle the Irish Question" (1917), he envisaged a federal arrangement, with national and imperial parliaments. Holroyd records that by this time the separatist party <a href="Sinn%20F%C3%A9in">Sinn Féin</a> was in the ascendency, and Shaw's and other moderate schemes were forgotten.

In the postwar period, Shaw despaired of the British government's coercive policies towards Ireland, and joined his fellow-writers <a href="Hilaire%20Belloc">Hilaire Belloc</a> and <a href="G.%20K.%20Chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a> in publicly condemning these actions. The <a href="Anglo-Irish%20Treaty">Anglo-Irish Treaty</a> of December 1921 led to the <a href="partition%20of%20Ireland">partition of Ireland</a> between north and south, a provision that dismayed Shaw. In 1922 <a href="Irish%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> broke out in the south between its pro-treaty and anti-treaty factions, the former of whom had established the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a>. Shaw visited Dublin in August, and met <a href="Michael%20Collins%20%28Irish%20leader%29">Michael Collins</a>, then head of the Free State's <a href="Provisional%20Government%20of%20Ireland%20%281922%29">Provisional Government</a>. Shaw was much impressed by Collins, and was saddened when, three days later, the Irish leader was ambushed and killed by anti-treaty forces. In a letter to Collins's sister, Shaw wrote: "I met Michael for the first and last time on Saturday last, and am very glad I did. I rejoice in his memory, and will not be so disloyal to it as to snivel over his valiant death". Shaw remained a British subject all his life, but took dual British-Irish nationality in 1934.

Shaw's first major work to appear after the war was "<a href="Heartbreak%20House">Heartbreak House</a>", written in 1916–17 and performed in 1920. It was produced on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> in November, and was coolly received; according to "The Times": "Mr Shaw on this occasion has more than usual to say and takes twice as long as usual to say it". After the London premiere in October 1921 "The Times" concurred with the American critics: "As usual with Mr Shaw, the play is about an hour too long", although containing "much entertainment and some profitable reflection". Ervine in "The Observer" thought the play brilliant but ponderously acted, except for <a href="Edith%20Evans">Edith Evans</a> as Lady Utterword.

Shaw's largest-scale theatrical work was "<a href="Back%20to%20Methuselah">Back to Methuselah</a>", written in 1918–20 and staged in 1922. Weintraub describes it as "Shaw's attempt to fend off 'the bottomless pit of an utterly discouraging pessimism'". This cycle of five interrelated plays depicts evolution, and the effects of longevity, from the Garden of Eden to the year 31,920 AD. Critics found the five plays strikingly uneven in quality and invention. The original run was brief, and the work has been revived infrequently. Shaw felt he had exhausted his remaining creative powers in the huge span of this "Metabiological Pentateuch". He was now sixty-seven, and expected to write no more plays.

This mood was short-lived. In 1920 <a href="Joan%20of%20Arc">Joan of Arc</a> was proclaimed a <a href="Saint%23Catholic%20Church">saint</a> by <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XV">Pope Benedict XV</a>; Shaw had long found Joan an interesting historical character, and his view of her veered between "half-witted genius" and someone of "exceptional sanity". He had considered writing a play about her in 1913, and the <a href="canonization">canonisation</a> prompted him to return to the subject. He wrote "<a href="Saint%20Joan%20%28play%29">Saint Joan</a>" in the middle months of 1923, and the play was premiered on Broadway in December. It was enthusiastically received there, and at its London premiere the following March. In Weintraub's phrase, "even the Nobel prize committee could no longer ignore Shaw after Saint Joan". The citation for the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">literature prize</a> for 1925 praised his work as "... marked by both idealism and humanity, its stimulating satire often being infused with a singular poetic beauty". He accepted the award, but rejected the monetary prize that went with it, on the grounds that "My readers and my audiences provide me with more than sufficient money for my needs".

After "Saint Joan", it was five years before Shaw wrote a play. From 1924, he spent four years writing what he described as his "magnum opus", a political treatise entitled "The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism". The book was published in 1928 and sold well. At the end of the decade Shaw produced his final Fabian tract, a commentary on the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>. He described the League as "a school for the new international statesmanship as against the old Foreign Office diplomacy", but thought that it had not yet become the "Federation of the World".

Shaw returned to the theatre with what he called "a political extravaganza", "<a href="The%20Apple%20Cart">The Apple Cart</a>", written in late 1928. It was, in Ervine's view, unexpectedly popular, taking a conservative, monarchist, anti-democratic line that appealed to contemporary audiences. The premiere was in Warsaw in June 1928, and the first British production was two months later, at <a href="Barry%20Jackson%20%28director%29">Sir Barry Jackson</a>'s inaugural <a href="The%20Malvern%20Festival%20%281929-1939%29">Malvern Festival</a>. The other eminent creative artist most closely associated with the festival was <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Sir Edward Elgar</a>, with whom Shaw enjoyed a deep friendship and mutual regard. He described "The Apple Cart" to Elgar as "a scandalous Aristophanic burlesque of democratic politics, with a brief but shocking sex interlude".

During the 1920s Shaw began to lose faith in the idea that society could be changed through Fabian gradualism, and became increasingly fascinated with dictatorial methods. In 1922 he had welcomed <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Mussolini</a>'s accession to power in Italy, observing that amid the "indiscipline and muddle and Parliamentary deadlock", Mussolini was "the right kind of tyrant". Shaw was prepared to tolerate certain dictatorial excesses; Weintraub in his <a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">ODNB</a> biographical sketch comments that Shaw's "flirtation with authoritarian inter-war regimes" took a long time to fade, and Beatrice Webb thought he was "obsessed" about Mussolini.

Shaw's enthusiasm for the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> dated to the early 1920s when he had hailed <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Lenin</a> as "the one really interesting statesman in Europe". Having turned down several chances to visit, in 1931 he joined a party led by <a href="Nancy%20Astor%2C%20Viscountess%20Astor">Nancy Astor</a>. The carefully managed trip culminated in a lengthy meeting with <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Stalin</a>, whom Shaw later described as "a Georgian gentleman" with no malice in him. At a dinner given in his honour, Shaw told the gathering: "I have seen all the 'terrors' and I was terribly pleased by them". In March 1933 Shaw was a co-signatory to a letter in "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" protesting at the continuing misrepresentation of Soviet achievements: "No lie is too fantastic, no slander is too stale ... for employment by the more reckless elements of the British press."

Shaw's admiration for Mussolini and Stalin demonstrated his growing belief that dictatorship was the only viable political arrangement. When the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> came to power in Germany in January 1933, Shaw described <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Hitler</a> as "a very remarkable man, a very able man", and professed himself proud to be the only writer in England who was "scrupulously polite and just to Hitler". His principal admiration was for Stalin, whose regime he championed uncritically throughout the decade. Shaw saw the 1939 <a href="Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop%20Pact">Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact</a> as a triumph for Stalin who, he said, now had Hitler under his thumb.

Shaw's first play of the decade was "<a href="Too%20True%20to%20be%20Good">Too True to be Good</a>", written in 1931 and premiered in <a href="Boston">Boston</a> in February 1932. The reception was unenthusiastic. <a href="Brooks%20Atkinson">Brooks Atkinson</a> of "The New York Times" commenting that Shaw had "yielded to the impulse to write without having a subject", judged the play a "rambling and indifferently tedious conversation". The correspondent of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune">The New York Herald Tribune</a>" said that most of the play was "discourse, unbelievably long lectures" and that although the audience enjoyed the play it was bewildered by it.
During the decade Shaw travelled widely and frequently. Most of his journeys were with Charlotte; she enjoyed voyages on ocean liners, and he found peace to write during the long spells at sea. Shaw met an enthusiastic welcome in <a href="Union%20of%20South%20Africa">South Africa</a> in 1932, despite his strong remarks about the racial divisions of the country. In December 1932 the couple embarked on a round-the-world cruise. In March 1933 they arrived at <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, to begin Shaw's first visit to the US. He had earlier refused to go to "that awful country, that uncivilized place", "unfit to govern itself... illiberal, superstitious, crude, violent, anarchic and arbitrary". He visited <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, with which he was unimpressed, and New York, where he lectured to a capacity audience in the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera%20House%20%2839th%20Street%29">Metropolitan Opera House</a>. Harried by the intrusive attentions of the press, Shaw was glad when his ship sailed from <a href="New%20York%20Harbor">New York harbour</a>. New Zealand, which he and Charlotte visited the following year, struck him as "the best country I've been in"; he urged its people to be more confident and loosen their dependence on trade with Britain. He used the weeks at sea to complete two plays—"<a href="The%20Simpleton%20of%20the%20Unexpected%20Isles">The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles</a>" and "<a href="The%20Six%20of%20Calais">The Six of Calais</a>"—and begin work on a third, "<a href="The%20Millionairess%20%28play%29">The Millionairess</a>".

Despite his contempt for Hollywood and its aesthetic values, Shaw was enthusiastic about cinema, and in the middle of the decade wrote screenplays for prospective film versions of "Pygmalion" and "Saint Joan". The latter was never made, but Shaw entrusted the rights to the former to the unknown <a href="Gabriel%20Pascal">Gabriel Pascal</a>, who produced it at <a href="Pinewood%20Studios">Pinewood Studios</a> in 1938. Shaw was determined that Hollywood should have nothing to do with the film, but was powerless to prevent it from winning one <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Award</a> ("Oscar"); he described his award for "best-written screenplay" as an insult, coming from such a source. He became the first person to have been awarded both a Nobel Prize and an Oscar. In a 1993 study of the Oscars, <a href="Anthony%20Holden">Anthony Holden</a> observes that "Pygmalion" was soon spoken of as having "lifted movie-making from illiteracy to literacy".

Shaw's final plays of the 1930s were "<a href="Cymbeline%20Refinished">Cymbeline Refinished</a>" (1936), "<a href="Geneva%20%28play%29">Geneva</a>" (1936) and "<a href="In%20Good%20King%20Charles%27s%20Golden%20Days">In Good King Charles's Golden Days</a>" (1939). The first, a fantasy reworking of Shakespeare, made little impression, but the second, a satire on European dictators, attracted more notice, much of it unfavourable. In particular, Shaw's parody of Hitler as "Herr Battler" was considered mild, almost sympathetic. The third play, an historical conversation piece first seen at Malvern, ran briefly in London in May 1940. <a href="James%20Agate">James Agate</a> commented that the play contained nothing to which even the most conservative audiences could take exception, and though it was long and lacking in dramatic action only "witless and idle" theatregoers would object. After their first runs none of the three plays were seen again in the West End during Shaw's lifetime.

Towards the end of the decade, both Shaws began to suffer ill health. Charlotte was increasingly incapacitated by <a href="Paget%27s%20disease%20of%20bone">Paget's disease of bone</a>, and he developed <a href="pernicious%20anaemia">pernicious anaemia</a>. His treatment, involving injections of concentrated animal liver, was successful, but this breach of his vegetarian creed distressed him and brought down condemnation from militant vegetarians.

Although Shaw's works since "The Apple Cart" had been received without great enthusiasm, his earlier plays were revived in the West End throughout the Second World War, starring such actors as Edith Evans, <a href="John%20Gielgud">John Gielgud</a>, <a href="Deborah%20Kerr">Deborah Kerr</a> and <a href="Robert%20Donat">Robert Donat</a>. In 1944 nine Shaw plays were staged in London, including "Arms and the Man" with <a href="Ralph%20Richardson">Ralph Richardson</a>, <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>, <a href="Sybil%20Thorndike">Sybil Thorndike</a> and <a href="Margaret%20Leighton">Margaret Leighton</a> in the leading roles. Two touring companies took his plays all round Britain. The revival in his popularity did not tempt Shaw to write a new play, and he concentrated on prolific journalism. A second Shaw film produced by Pascal, "<a href="Major%20Barbara%20%28film%29">Major Barbara</a>" (1941), was less successful both artistically and commercially than "Pygmalion", partly because of Pascal's insistence on directing, to which he was unsuited.

Following the <a href="British%20and%20French%20declaration%20of%20war%20on%20Germany">outbreak of war</a> on 3 September 1939 and the rapid <a href="Invasion%20of%20Poland">conquest of Poland</a>, Shaw was accused of defeatism when, in a "New Statesman" article, he declared the war over and demanded a peace conference. Nevertheless, when he became convinced that a negotiated peace was impossible, he publicly urged the neutral United States to join the fight. The <a href="The%20Blitz">London blitz</a> of 1940–41 led the Shaws, both in their mid-eighties, to live full-time at Ayot St Lawrence. Even there they were not immune from enemy air raids, and stayed on occasion with Nancy Astor at her country house, <a href="Cliveden">Cliveden</a>. In 1943, the worst of the London bombing over, the Shaws moved back to Whitehall Court, where medical help for Charlotte was more easily arranged. Her condition deteriorated, and she died in September.

Shaw's final political treatise, "Everybody's Political What's What", was published in 1944. Holroyd describes this as "a rambling narrative ... that repeats ideas he had given better elsewhere and then repeats itself". The book sold well—85,000 copies by the end of the year. After Hitler's suicide in May 1945, Shaw approved of the formal condolences offered by the Irish <a href="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a>, <a href="%C3%89amon%20de%20Valera">Éamon de Valera</a>, at the German embassy in Dublin. Shaw disapproved of the postwar <a href="Nuremberg%20trials">trials of the defeated German leaders</a>, as an act of self-righteousness: "We are all potential criminals".

Pascal was given a third opportunity to film Shaw's work with "<a href="Caesar%20and%20Cleopatra%20%28film%29">Caesar and Cleopatra</a>" (1945). It cost three times its original budget and was rated "the biggest financial failure in the history of British cinema". The film was poorly received by British critics, although American reviews were friendlier. Shaw thought its lavishness nullified the drama, and he considered the film "a poor imitation of <a href="Cecil%20B.%20de%20Mille">Cecil B. de Mille</a>".
In 1946, the year of Shaw's ninetieth birthday, he accepted the freedom of Dublin and became the first honorary freeman of the borough of St Pancras, London. In the same year the government asked Shaw informally whether he would accept the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">Order of Merit</a>. He declined, believing that an author's merit could only be determined by the posthumous verdict of history. 1946 saw the publication, as "The Crime of Imprisonment", of the preface Shaw had written 20 years previously to a study of prison conditions. It was widely praised; a reviewer in the "<a href="American%20Journal%20of%20Public%20Health">American Journal of Public Health</a>" considered it essential reading for any student of the American criminal justice system.

Shaw continued to write into his nineties. His last plays were "<a href="Buoyant%20Billions">Buoyant Billions</a>" (1947), his final full-length work; "<a href="Farfetched%20Fables">Farfetched Fables</a>" (1948) a set of six short plays revisiting several of his earlier themes such as evolution; a comic play for puppets, "<a href="Shakes%20versus%20Shav">Shakes versus Shav</a>" (1949), a ten-minute piece in which Shakespeare and Shaw trade insults; and "<a href="Why%20She%20Would%20Not">Why She Would Not</a>" (1950), which Shaw described as "a little comedy", written in one week shortly before his ninety-fourth birthday.

During his later years, Shaw enjoyed tending the gardens at <a href="Shaw%27s%20Corner">Shaw's Corner</a>. He died at the age of ninety-four of <a href="renal%20failure">renal failure</a> precipitated by injuries incurred when falling while pruning a tree. He was cremated at <a href="Golders%20Green%20Crematorium">Golders Green Crematorium</a> on 6 November 1950. His ashes, mixed with those of Charlotte, were scattered along footpaths and around the statue of Saint Joan in their garden.

Shaw published a collected edition of his plays in 1934, comprising forty-two works. He wrote a further twelve in the remaining sixteen years of his life, mostly <a href="one-act%20play">one-act</a> pieces. Including eight earlier plays that he chose to omit from his published works, the total is sixty-two.

Shaw's first three full-length plays dealt with social issues. He later grouped them as "Plays Unpleasant". "Widower's Houses" (1892) concerns the landlords of slum properties, and introduces the first of Shaw's <a href="New%20Woman">New Women</a>—a recurring feature of later plays. "The Philanderer" (1893) develops the theme of the New Woman, draws on Ibsen, and has elements of Shaw's personal relationships, the character of Julia being based on Jenny Patterson. In a 2003 study Judith Evans describes "Mrs Warren's Profession" (1893) as "undoubtedly the most challenging" of the three Plays Unpleasant, taking Mrs Warren's profession—prostitute and, later, brothel-owner—as a metaphor for a prostituted society.

Shaw followed the first trilogy with a second, published as "Plays Pleasant". "Arms and the Man" (1894) conceals beneath a mock-Ruritanian comic romance a Fabian parable contrasting impractical idealism with pragmatic socialism. The central theme of "Candida" (1894) is a woman's choice between two men; the play contrasts the outlook and aspirations of a <a href="Christian%20socialism">Christian Socialist</a> and a poetic idealist. The third of the Pleasant group, "You Never Can Tell" (1896), portrays social mobility, and the gap between generations, particularly in how they approach social relations in general and mating in particular.

The "Three Plays for Puritans"—comprising "The Devil's Disciple" (1896), "Caesar and Cleopatra" (1898) and "Captain Brassbound's Conversion" (1899)—all centre on questions of empire and imperialism, a major topic of political discourse in the 1890s. The three are set, respectively, in <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">1770s America</a>, Ancient Egypt, and <a href="History%20of%20Morocco%23European%20influence%20%28c.%201830%20%E2%80%93%201956%29">1890s Morocco</a>. "The Gadfly", an adaptation of <a href="The%20Gadfly">the popular novel</a> by <a href="Ethel%20Voynich">Ethel Voynich</a>, was unfinished and unperformed. "The Man of Destiny" (1895) is a short <a href="curtain%20raiser">curtain raiser</a> about <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>.

Shaw's major plays of the first decade of the twentieth century address individual social, political or ethical issues. "Man and Superman" (1902) stands apart from the others in both its subject and its treatment, giving Shaw's interpretation of <a href="Creative%20Evolution%20%28book%29">creative evolution</a> in a combination of drama and associated printed text. "The Admirable Bashville" (1901), a blank verse dramatisation of Shaw's novel "Cashel Byron's Profession", focuses on the imperial relationship between <a href="Scramble%20for%20Africa%23United%20Kingdom">Britain and Africa</a>. "John Bull's Other Island" (1904), comically depicting the prevailing relationship between Britain and Ireland, was popular at the time but fell out of the general repertoire in later years. "Major Barbara" (1905) presents ethical questions in an unconventional way, confounding expectations that in the depiction of an armaments manufacturer on the one hand and the Salvation Army on the other the moral high ground must invariably be held by the latter. "The Doctor's Dilemma" (1906), a play about medical ethics and moral choices in allocating scarce treatment, was described by Shaw as a tragedy. With a reputation for presenting characters who did not resemble real flesh and blood, he was challenged by Archer to present an on-stage death, and here did so, with a deathbed scene for the <a href="anti-hero">anti-hero</a>.

"Getting Married" (1908) and "Misalliance" (1909)—the latter seen by Judith Evans as a companion piece to the former—are both in what Shaw called his "disquisitionary" vein, with the emphasis on discussion of ideas rather than on dramatic events or vivid characterisation. Shaw wrote seven short plays during the decade; they are all comedies, ranging from the deliberately absurd "<a href="Passion%2C%20Poison%2C%20and%20Petrifaction">Passion, Poison, and Petrifaction</a>" (1905) to the satirical "<a href="Press%20Cuttings">Press Cuttings</a>" (1909).

In the decade from 1910 to the aftermath of the First World War Shaw wrote four full-length plays, the third and fourth of which are among his most frequently staged works. "Fanny's First Play" (1911) continues his earlier examinations of middle-class British society from a Fabian viewpoint, with additional touches of melodrama and an epilogue in which theatre critics discuss the play. "Androcles and the Lion" (1912), which Shaw began writing as a play for children, became a study of the nature of religion and how to put Christian precepts into practice. "Pygmalion" (1912) is a Shavian study of language and speech and their importance in society and in personal relationships. To correct the impression left by the original performers that the play portrayed a romantic relationship between the two main characters Shaw rewrote the ending to make it clear that the heroine will marry another, minor character. Shaw's only full-length play from the war years is "Heartbreak House" (1917), which in his words depicts "cultured, leisured Europe before the war" drifting towards disaster. Shaw named Shakespeare ("<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>") and <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Chekhov</a> ("<a href="The%20Cherry%20Orchard">The Cherry Orchard</a>") as important influences on the piece, and critics have found elements drawing on <a href="William%20Congreve">Congreve</a> ("<a href="The%20Way%20of%20the%20World">The Way of the World</a>") and Ibsen ("<a href="The%20Master%20Builder">The Master Builder</a>").

The short plays range from genial historical drama in "The Dark Lady of the Sonnets" and "Great Catherine" (1910 and 1913) to a study of polygamy in "Overruled"; three satirical works about the war ("The Inca of Perusalem", "O'Flaherty V.C." and "Augustus Does His Bit", 1915–16); a piece that Shaw called "utter nonsense" ("The Music Cure", 1914) and a brief sketch about a "Bolshevik empress" ("Annajanska", 1917).

"Saint Joan" (1923) drew widespread praise both for Shaw and for Sybil Thorndike, for whom he wrote the title role and who created the part in Britain. In the view of the commentator Nicholas Grene, Shaw's Joan, a "no-nonsense mystic, Protestant and nationalist before her time" is among the 20th century's classic leading female roles. "The Apple Cart" (1929) was Shaw's last popular success. He gave both that play and its successor, "Too True to Be Good" (1931), the subtitle "A political extravaganza", although the two works differ greatly in their themes; the first presents the politics of a nation (with a brief royal love-scene as an interlude) and the second, in Judith Evans's words, "is concerned with the social mores of the individual, and is nebulous." Shaw's plays of the 1930s were written in the shadow of worsening national and international political events. Once again, with "On the Rocks" (1933) and "The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles" (1934), a political comedy with a clear plot was followed by an introspective drama. The first play portrays a British prime minister considering, but finally rejecting, the establishment of a dictatorship; the second is concerned with polygamy and <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a> and ends with the Day of Judgement.

"The Millionairess" (1934) is a farcical depiction of the commercial and social affairs of a successful businesswoman. "Geneva" (1936) lampoons the feebleness of the League of Nations compared with the dictators of Europe. "In Good King Charles's Golden Days" (1939), described by Weintraub as a warm, discursive high comedy, also depicts authoritarianism, but less satirically than "Geneva". As in earlier decades, the shorter plays were generally comedies, some historical and others addressing various political and social preoccupations of the author. Ervine writes of Shaw's later work that although it was still "astonishingly vigorous and vivacious" it showed unmistakable signs of his age. "The best of his work in this period, however, was full of wisdom and the beauty of mind often displayed by old men who keep their wits about them."

Shaw's collected musical criticism, published in three volumes, runs to more than 2,700 pages. It covers the British musical scene from 1876 to 1950, but the core of the collection dates from his six years as music critic of "The Star" and "The World" in the late 1880s and early 1890s. In his view music criticism should be interesting to everyone rather than just the musical élite, and he wrote for the non-specialist, avoiding technical jargon—"Mesopotamian words like 'the dominant of D major'". He was fiercely partisan in his columns, promoting the music of Wagner and decrying that of <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a> and those British composers such as <a href="Charles%20Villiers%20Stanford">Stanford</a> and <a href="Hubert%20Parry">Parry</a> whom he saw as Brahmsian. He campaigned against the prevailing fashion for performances of <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">Handel</a> <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a>s with huge amateur choirs and inflated orchestration, calling for "a chorus of twenty capable artists". He railed against opera productions unrealistically staged or sung in languages the audience did not speak.

In Shaw's view, the London theatres of the 1890s presented too many revivals of old plays and not enough new work. He campaigned against "<a href="melodrama">melodrama</a>, <a href="sentimentality">sentimentality</a>, <a href="Stereotype%23Role%20in%20art%20and%20culture">stereotypes</a> and worn-out conventions". As a music critic he had frequently been able to concentrate on analysing new works, but in the theatre he was often obliged to fall back on discussing how various performers tackled well-known plays. In a study of Shaw's work as a theatre critic, E. J. West writes that Shaw "ceaselessly compared and contrasted artists in interpretation and in technique". Shaw contributed more than 150 articles as theatre critic for "The Saturday Review", in which he assessed more than 212 productions. He championed <a href="Henrik%20Ibsen">Ibsen</a>'s plays when many theatregoers regarded them as outrageous, and his 1891 book "<a href="Quintessence%20of%20Ibsenism">Quintessence of Ibsenism</a>" remained a classic throughout the twentieth century. Of contemporary dramatists writing for the West End stage he rated <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> above the rest: "... our only thorough playwright. He plays with everything: with wit, with philosophy, with drama, with actors and audience, with the whole theatre". Shaw's collected criticisms were published as "Our Theatres in the Nineties" in 1932.

Shaw maintained a provocative and frequently self-contradictory attitude to Shakespeare (whose name he insisted on spelling "Shakespear"). Many found him difficult to take seriously on the subject; <a href="Duff%20Cooper">Duff Cooper</a> observed that by attacking Shakespeare, "it is Shaw who appears a ridiculous pigmy shaking his fist at a mountain." Shaw was, nevertheless, a knowledgeable Shakespearian, and in an article in which he wrote, "With the single exception of <a href="Homer">Homer</a>, there is no eminent writer, not even Sir Walter Scott, whom I can despise so entirely as I despise Shakespear when I measure my mind against his," he also said, "But I am bound to add that I pity the man who cannot enjoy Shakespear. He has outlasted thousands of abler thinkers, and will outlast a thousand more". Shaw had two regular targets for his more extreme comments about Shakespeare: undiscriminating "<a href="Bardolatry">Bardolaters</a>", and actors and directors who presented insensitively cut texts in over-elaborate productions. He was continually drawn back to Shakespeare, and wrote three plays with Shakespearean themes: "<a href="The%20Dark%20Lady%20of%20the%20Sonnets">The Dark Lady of the Sonnets</a>", "Cymbeline Refinished" and "Shakes versus Shav". In a 2001 analysis of Shaw's Shakespearian criticisms, Robert Pierce concludes that Shaw, who was no academic, saw Shakespeare's plays—like all theatre—from an author's practical point of view: "Shaw helps us to get away from the Romantics' picture of Shakespeare as a titanic genius, one whose art cannot be analyzed or connected with the mundane considerations of theatrical conditions and profit and loss, or with a specific staging and cast of actors."

Shaw's political and social commentaries were published variously in Fabian tracts, in essays, in two full-length books, in innumerable newspaper and journal articles and in prefaces to his plays. The majority of Shaw's Fabian tracts were published anonymously, representing the voice of the society rather than of Shaw, although the society's secretary <a href="Edward%20R.%20Pease">Edward Pease</a> later confirmed Shaw's authorship. According to Holroyd, the business of the early Fabians, mainly under the influence of Shaw, was to "alter history by rewriting it". Shaw's talent as a pamphleteer was put to immediate use in the production of the society's manifesto—after which, says Holroyd, he was never again so succinct.
After the turn of the twentieth century, Shaw increasingly propagated his ideas through the medium of his plays. An early critic, writing in 1904, observed that Shaw's dramas provided "a pleasant means" of proselytising his socialism, adding that "Mr Shaw's views are to be sought especially in the prefaces to his plays". After loosening his ties with the Fabian movement in 1911, Shaw's writings were more personal and often provocative; his response to the furore following the issue of "Common Sense About the War" in 1914, was to prepare a sequel, "More Common Sense About the War". In this, he denounced the pacifist line espoused by Ramsay MacDonald and other socialist leaders, and proclaimed his readiness to shoot all pacifists rather than cede them power and influence. On the advice of Beatrice Webb, this pamphlet remained unpublished.

"The Intelligent Woman's Guide", Shaw's main political treatise of the 1920s, attracted both admiration and criticism. MacDonald considered it the world's most important book since the Bible; <a href="Harold%20Laski">Harold Laski</a> thought its arguments outdated and lacking in concern for individual freedoms. Shaw's increasing flirtation with dictatorial methods is evident in many of his subsequent pronouncements. A "New York Times" report dated 10 December 1933 quoted a recent Fabian Society lecture in which Shaw had praised Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin: "[T]hey are trying to get something done, [and] are adopting methods by which it is possible to get something done". As late as the Second World War, in "Everybody's Political What's What", Shaw blamed the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allies</a>' "abuse" of their 1918 victory for the rise of Hitler, and hoped that, after defeat, the Führer would escape retribution "to enjoy a comfortable retirement in Ireland or some other neutral country". These sentiments, according to the Irish philosopher-poet Thomas Duddy, "rendered much of the Shavian outlook passé and contemptible".

"Creative evolution", Shaw's version of the new science of <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a>, became an increasing theme in his political writing after 1900. He introduced his theories in "The Revolutionist's Handbook" (1903), an appendix to "Man and Superman", and developed them further during the 1920s in "Back to Methuselah". A 1946 "Life" magazine article observed that Shaw had "always tended to look at people more as a biologist than as an artist". By 1933, in the preface to "On the Rocks", he was writing that "if we desire a certain type of civilization and culture we must exterminate the sort of people who do not fit into it"; critical opinion is divided on whether this was intended as irony. In an article in the American magazine "Liberty" in September 1938, Shaw included the statement: "There are many people in the world who ought to be liquidated". Many commentators assumed that such comments were intended as a joke, although in the worst possible taste. Otherwise, "Life" magazine concluded, "this silliness can be classed with his more innocent bad guesses".

Shaw's fiction-writing was largely confined to the five unsuccessful novels written in the period 1879–1885. "Immaturity" (1879) is a semi-autobiographical portrayal of mid-Victorian England, Shaw's "own "David Copperfield"" according to Weintraub. "The Irrational Knot" (1880) is a critique of conventional marriage, in which Weintraub finds the characterisations lifeless, "hardly more than animated theories". Shaw was pleased with his third novel, "Love Among the Artists" (1881), feeling that it marked a turning point in his development as a thinker, although he had no more success with it than with its predecessors. "Cashel Byron's Profession" (1882) is, says Weintraub, an indictment of society which anticipates Shaw's first full-length play, "Mrs Warren's Profession". Shaw later explained that he had intended "An Unsocial Socialist" as the first section of a monumental depiction of the downfall of capitalism. <a href="Gareth%20Griffiths%20%28academic%29">Gareth Griffith</a>, in a study of Shaw's political thought, sees the novel as an interesting record of conditions, both in society at large and in the nascent socialist movement of the 1880s.

Shaw's only subsequent fiction of any substance was his 1932 novella "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20the%20Black%20Girl%20in%20Her%20Search%20for%20God">The Adventures of the Black Girl in Her Search for God</a>", written during a visit to South Africa in 1932. The eponymous girl, intelligent, inquisitive, and converted to Christianity by insubstantial missionary teaching, sets out to find God, on a journey that after many adventures and encounters, leads her to a secular conclusion. The story, on publication, offended some Christians and was banned in Ireland by the Board of Censors.

Shaw was a prolific correspondent throughout his life. His letters, edited by Dan H. Laurence, were published between 1965 and 1988. Shaw once estimated his letters would occupy twenty volumes; Laurence commented that, unedited, they would fill many more. Shaw wrote more than a quarter of a million letters, of which about ten per cent have survived; 2,653 letters are printed in Laurence's four volumes. Among Shaw's many regular correspondents were his childhood friend <a href="Edward%20McNulty">Edward McNulty</a>; his theatrical colleagues (and "<a href="platonic%20love">amitiés amoureuses</a>") <a href="Mrs%20Patrick%20Campbell">Mrs Patrick Campbell</a> and <a href="Ellen%20Terry">Ellen Terry</a>; writers including <a href="Lord%20Alfred%20Douglas">Lord Alfred Douglas</a>, H. G. Wells and G. K. Chesterton; the boxer <a href="Gene%20Tunney">Gene Tunney</a>; the nun <a href="Laurentia%20McLachlan">Laurentia McLachlan</a>; and the art expert <a href="Sydney%20Cockerell">Sydney Cockerell</a>. In 2007 a 316-page volume consisting entirely of Shaw's letters to "The Times" was published.

Shaw's diaries for 1885–1897, edited by Weintraub, were published in two volumes, with a total of 1,241 pages, in 1986. Reviewing them, the Shaw scholar Fred Crawford wrote: "Although the primary interest for Shavians is the material that supplements what we already know about Shaw's life and work, the diaries are also valuable as a historical and sociological document of English life at the end of the Victorian age." After 1897, pressure of other writing led Shaw to give up keeping a diary.

Through his journalism, pamphlets and occasional longer works, Shaw wrote on many subjects. His range of interest and enquiry included <a href="vivisection">vivisection</a>, vegetarianism, religion, language, cinema and photography, on all of which he wrote and spoke copiously. Collections of his writings on these and other subjects were published, mainly after his death, together with volumes of "wit and wisdom" and general journalism.

Despite the many books written about him (Holroyd counts 80 by 1939) Shaw's autobiographical output, apart from his diaries, was relatively slight. He gave interviews to newspapers—"GBS Confesses", to "<a href="The%20Daily%20Mail">The Daily Mail</a>" in 1904 is an example—and provided sketches to would-be biographers whose work was rejected by Shaw and never published. In 1939 Shaw drew on these materials to produce "Shaw Gives Himself Away", a miscellany which, a year before his death, he revised and republished as "Sixteen Self Sketches" (there were seventeen). He made it clear to his publishers that this slim book was in no sense a full autobiography.

In his lifetime Shaw professed many beliefs, often contradictory. This inconsistency was partly an intentional provocation—the Spanish scholar-statesman <a href="Salvador%20de%20Madariaga">Salvador de Madariaga</a> describes Shaw as "a pole of negative electricity set in a people of positive electricity". In one area at least Shaw was constant: in his lifelong refusal to follow normal English forms of spelling and punctuation. He favoured archaic spellings such as "shew" for "show"; he dropped the "u" in words like "honour" and "favour"; and wherever possible he rejected the apostrophe in contractions such as "won't" or "that's". In his will, Shaw ordered that, after some specified legacies, his remaining assets were to form a trust to pay for fundamental reform of the English alphabet into a phonetic version of forty letters. Though Shaw's intentions were clear, his drafting was flawed, and the courts initially ruled the intended trust void. A later out-of-court agreement provided a sum of £8,300 for spelling reform; the bulk of his fortune went to the residuary legatees—the British Museum, the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Dramatic%20Art">Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</a> and the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Ireland">National Gallery of Ireland</a>. Most of the £8,300 went on a special phonetic edition of "Androcles and the Lion" in the <a href="Shavian%20alphabet">Shavian alphabet</a>, published in 1962 to a largely indifferent reception.

Shaw's views on religion and Christianity were less consistent. Having in his youth proclaimed himself an atheist, in middle age he explained this as a reaction against the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> image of a vengeful Jehovah. By the early twentieth century, he termed himself a "mystic", although Gary Sloan, in an essay on Shaw's beliefs, disputes his credentials as such. In 1913 Shaw declared that he was not religious "in the sectarian sense", aligning himself with Jesus as "a person of no religion". In the preface (1915) to "Androcles and the Lion", Shaw asks "Why not give Christianity a chance?" contending that Britain's social order resulted from the continuing choice of <a href="Barabbas">Barabbas</a> over Christ. In a broadcast just before the Second World War, Shaw invoked the <a href="Sermon%20on%20the%20Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a>, "a very moving exhortation, and it gives you one first-rate tip, which is to do good to those who despitefully use you and persecute you". In his will, Shaw stated that his "religious convictions and scientific views cannot at present be more specifically defined than as those of a believer in creative revolution". He requested that no one should imply that he accepted the beliefs of any specific religious organisation, and that no memorial to him should "take the form of a cross or any other instrument of torture or symbol of blood sacrifice".

Shaw espoused racial equality, and inter-marriage between people of different races. Despite his expressed wish to be fair to Hitler, he called anti-Semitism "the hatred of the lazy, ignorant fat-headed Gentile for the pertinacious Jew who, schooled by adversity to use his brains to the utmost, outdoes him in business". In "<a href="The%20Jewish%20Chronicle">The Jewish Chronicle</a>" he wrote in 1932, "In every country you can find rabid people who have a phobia against Jews, Jesuits, Armenians, Negroes, Freemasons, Irishmen, or simply foreigners as such. Political parties are not above exploiting these fears and jealousies."

In 1903 Shaw joined in a <a href="vaccine%20controversies">controversy about vaccination</a> against smallpox. He called vaccination "a peculiarly filthy piece of witchcraft"; in his view immunisation campaigns were a cheap and inadequate substitute for a decent programme of housing for the poor, which would, he declared, be the means of eradicating smallpox and other infectious diseases. Less contentiously, Shaw was keenly interested in transport; Laurence observed in 1992 a need for a published study of Shaw's interest in "bicycling, motorbikes, automobiles, and planes, climaxing in his joining the <a href="British%20Interplanetary%20Society">Interplanetary Society</a> in his nineties". Shaw published articles on travel, took photographs of his journeys, and submitted notes to the <a href="Royal%20Automobile%20Club">Royal Automobile Club</a>.

Shaw strove throughout his adult life to be referred to as "Bernard Shaw" rather than "George Bernard Shaw", but confused matters by continuing to use his full initials—G.B.S.—as a by-line, and often signed himself "G.Bernard Shaw". He left instructions in his will that his executor (the <a href="Public%20Trustee">Public Trustee</a>) was to license publication of his works only under the name Bernard Shaw. Shaw scholars including Ervine, Judith Evans, Holroyd, Laurence and Weintraub, and many publishers have respected Shaw's preference, although the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Press">Cambridge University Press</a> was among the exceptions with its 1988 "Cambridge Companion to George Bernard Shaw".

Shaw did not found a school of dramatists as such, but Crawford asserts that today "we recognise [him] as second only to Shakespeare in the British theatrical tradition ... the proponent of the theater of ideas" who struck a death-blow to 19th-century melodrama. According to Laurence, Shaw pioneered "intelligent" theatre, in which the audience was required to think, thereby paving the way for the new breeds of twentieth-century playwrights from <a href="John%20Galsworthy">Galsworthy</a> to <a href="Harold%20Pinter">Pinter</a>.

Crawford lists numerous playwrights whose work owes something to that of Shaw. Among those active in Shaw's lifetime he includes <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a>, who based his early comedy "The Young Idea" on "You Never Can Tell" and continued to draw on the older man's works in later plays. <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>, by no means an admirer of Shaw, admitted that the epilogue of "<a href="Murder%20in%20the%20Cathedral">Murder in the Cathedral</a>", in which <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Becket</a>'s slayers explain their actions to the audience, might have been influenced by "Saint Joan". The critic <a href="Eric%20Bentley">Eric Bentley</a> comments that Eliot's later play "<a href="The%20Confidential%20Clerk">The Confidential Clerk</a>" "had all the earmarks of Shavianism ... without the merits of the real Bernard Shaw". Among more recent British dramatists, Crawford marks <a href="Tom%20Stoppard">Tom Stoppard</a> as "the most Shavian of contemporary playwrights"; Shaw's "serious farce" is continued in the works of Stoppard's contemporaries <a href="Alan%20Ayckbourn">Alan Ayckbourn</a>, <a href="Henry%20Livings">Henry Livings</a> and <a href="Peter%20Nichols">Peter Nichols</a>.
Shaw's influence crossed the Atlantic at an early stage. Bernard Dukore notes that he was successful as a dramatist in America ten years before achieving comparable success in Britain. Among many American writers professing a direct debt to Shaw, <a href="Eugene%20O%27Neill">Eugene O'Neill</a> became an admirer at the age of seventeen, after reading "The Quintessence of Ibsenism". Other Shaw-influenced American playwrights mentioned by Dukore are <a href="Elmer%20Rice">Elmer Rice</a>, for whom Shaw "opened doors, turned on lights, and expanded horizons"; <a href="William%20Saroyan">William Saroyan</a>, who empathised with Shaw as "the embattled individualist against the philistines"; and <a href="S.%20N.%20Behrman">S. N. Behrman</a>, who was inspired to write for the theatre after attending a performance of "Caesar and Cleopatra": "I thought it would be agreeable to write plays like that".

Assessing Shaw's reputation in a 1976 critical study, T. F. Evans described Shaw as unchallenged in his lifetime and since as the leading English-language dramatist of the (twentieth) century, and as a master of prose style. The following year, in a contrary assessment, the playwright <a href="John%20Osborne">John Osborne</a> castigated "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>'s" theatre critic <a href="Michael%20Billington%20%28critic%29">Michael Billington</a> for referring to Shaw as "the greatest British dramatist since Shakespeare". Osborne responded that Shaw "is the most fraudulent, inept writer of Victorian melodramas ever to gull a timid critic or fool a dull public". Despite this hostility, Crawford sees the influence of Shaw in some of Osborne's plays, and concludes that though the latter's work is neither imitative nor derivative, these affinities are sufficient to classify Osborne as an inheritor of Shaw.

In a 1983 study, R. J. Kaufmann suggests that Shaw was a key forerunner—"godfather, if not actually finicky paterfamilias"—of the <a href="Theatre%20of%20the%20Absurd">Theatre of the Absurd</a>. Two further aspects of Shaw's theatrical legacy are noted by Crawford: his opposition to stage censorship, which was finally ended in 1968, and his efforts which extended over many years to establish a <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">National Theatre</a>. Shaw's short 1910 play "The Dark Lady of the Sonnets", in which Shakespeare pleads with <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth I</a> for the endowment of a state theatre, was part of this campaign.

Writing in "<a href="New%20Statesman">The New Statesman</a>" in 2012 Daniel Janes commented that Shaw's reputation had declined by the time of his 150th anniversary in 2006 but had recovered considerably. In Janes's view, the many current revivals of Shaw's major works showed the playwright's "almost unlimited relevance to our times". In the same year, <a href="Mark%20Lawson">Mark Lawson</a> wrote in "The Guardian" that Shaw's moral concerns engaged present-day audiences, and made him—like his model, Ibsen—one of the most popular playwrights in contemporary British theatre.

The <a href="Shaw%20Festival">Shaw Festival</a> in <a href="Niagara-on-the-Lake">Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, Canada</a> is the second largest repertory theatre company in North America. It produces plays by or written during the lifetime of Shaw as well as some contemporary works. The <a href="Gingold%20Theatrical%20Group">Gingold Theatrical Group</a>, founded in 2006, presents works by Shaw and others in New York City that feature the humanitarian ideals that his work promoted. It became the first theatre group to present all of Shaw's stage work through its monthly concert series "Project Shaw".

In the 1940s the author <a href="Harold%20Nicolson">Harold Nicolson</a> advised the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a> not to accept the bequest of Shaw's Corner, predicting that Shaw would be totally forgotten within fifty years. In the event, Shaw's broad cultural legacy, embodied in the widely used term "Shavian", has endured and is nurtured by Shaw Societies in various parts of the world. The original society was founded in London in 1941 and survives; it organises meetings and events, and publishes a regular bulletin "The Shavian". The Shaw Society of America began in June 1950; it foundered in the 1970s but its journal, adopted by Penn State University Press, continued to be published as "Shaw: The Annual of Bernard Shaw Studies" until 2004. A second American organisation, founded in 1951 as "The Bernard Shaw Society", remains active . More recent societies have been established in Japan and India.

Besides his collected music criticism, Shaw has left a varied musical legacy, not all of it of his choosing. Despite his dislike of having his work adapted for the musical theatre ("my plays set themselves to a verbal music of their own") two of his plays were turned into musical comedies: "Arms and the Man" was the basis of "<a href="The%20Chocolate%20Soldier">The Chocolate Soldier</a>" in 1908, with music by <a href="Oscar%20Straus%20%28composer%29">Oscar Straus</a>, and "Pygmalion" was adapted in 1956 as "<a href="My%20Fair%20Lady">My Fair Lady</a>" with book and lyrics by <a href="Alan%20Jay%20Lerner">Alan Jay Lerner</a> and music by <a href="Frederick%20Loewe">Frederick Loewe</a>. Although he had a high regard for Elgar, Shaw turned down the composer's request for an opera libretto, but played a major part in persuading the BBC to commission Elgar's <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Elgar/Payne%29">Third Symphony</a>, and was the dedicatee of "<a href="The%20Severn%20Suite">The Severn Suite</a>" (1930).

The substance of Shaw's political legacy is uncertain. In 1921 Shaw's erstwhile collaborator William Archer, in a letter to the playwright, wrote: "I doubt if there is any case of a man so widely read, heard, seen, and known as yourself, who has produced so little effect on his generation." Margaret Cole, who considered Shaw the greatest writer of his age, professed never to have understood him. She thought he worked "immensely hard" at politics, but essentially, she surmises, it was for fun—"the fun of a brilliant artist". After Shaw's death, Pearson wrote: "No one since the time of Tom Paine has had so definite an influence on the social and political life of his time and country as Bernard Shaw."

In its obituary tribute to Shaw, "<a href="The%20Times%20Literary%20Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</a>" concluded:

Globular cluster

A globular cluster is a <a href="sphere">spherical</a> collection of <a href="star">star</a>s that orbit a <a href="Galactic%20Center">galactic core</a> as a <a href="Natural%20satellite">satellite</a>. Globular clusters are very tightly bound by <a href="gravity">gravity</a>, which gives them their spherical shapes and relatively high stellar densities toward their centers. The name of this category of <a href="star%20cluster">star cluster</a> is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "globulus"—a small sphere. A globular cluster is sometimes known more simply as a "globular".

Globular clusters are found in the <a href="Galactic%20halo">halo</a> of a <a href="galaxy">galaxy</a> and contain considerably more stars and are much older than the less dense <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a>s, which are found in the disk of a galaxy. Globular clusters are fairly common; there are about 150 to 158 currently known globular clusters in the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>, with perhaps 10 to 20 more still undiscovered. Larger galaxies can have more: <a href="Andromeda%20Galaxy">Andromeda Galaxy</a>, for instance, may have as many as 500. Some giant <a href="elliptical%20galaxy">elliptical galaxies</a> (particularly those at the centers of <a href="galaxy%20cluster">galaxy cluster</a>s), such as <a href="Messier%2087">M87</a>, have as many as 13,000 globular clusters.

Every galaxy of sufficient mass in the <a href="Local%20Group">Local Group</a> has an associated group of globular clusters, and almost every large galaxy surveyed has been found to possess a system of globular clusters. The <a href="Sagittarius%20Dwarf%20Elliptical%20Galaxy">Sagittarius Dwarf</a> galaxy and the <a href="Canis%20Major%20Overdensity%23Dispute">disputed Canis Major Dwarf galaxy</a> appear to be in the process of donating their associated globular clusters (such as <a href="Palomar%2012">Palomar 12</a>) to the Milky Way. This demonstrates how many of this galaxy's globular clusters might have been acquired in the past.

Although it appears that globular clusters contain some of the first stars to be produced in the galaxy, their <a href="galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution">origins</a> and their role in galactic evolution are still unclear. It does appear clear that globular clusters are significantly different from <a href="dwarf%20elliptical%20galaxy">dwarf elliptical galaxies</a> and were formed as part of the star formation of the parent galaxy rather than as a separate galaxy.

The first known globular cluster, now called <a href="Messier%2022">M22</a>, was discovered in 1665 by <a href="Abraham%20Ihle">Abraham Ihle</a>, a German amateur astronomer. However, given the small <a href="aperture">aperture</a> of early <a href="telescope">telescope</a>s, individual stars within a globular cluster were not <a href="Angular%20resolution">resolved</a> until <a href="Charles%20Messier">Charles Messier</a> observed <a href="Messier%204">M4</a> in 1764. The first eight globular clusters discovered are shown in the table. Subsequently, <a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Abbé Lacaille</a> would list <a href="47%20Tucanae">NGC 104</a>, <a href="NGC%204833">NGC 4833</a>, <a href="Messier%2055">M55</a>, <a href="Messier%2069">M69</a>, and <a href="NGC%206397">NGC 6397</a> in his 1751–52 catalogue. The "M" before a number refers to Charles Messier's catalogue, while "NGC" is from the <a href="New%20General%20Catalogue">New General Catalogue</a> by <a href="John%20Louis%20Emil%20Dreyer">John Dreyer</a>.

When <a href="William%20Herschel">William Herschel</a> began his comprehensive survey of the sky using large telescopes in 1782 there were 34 known globular clusters. Herschel discovered another 36 himself and was the first to resolve virtually all of them into stars. He coined the term "globular cluster" in his "<a href="Catalogue%20of%20Nebulae%20and%20Clusters%20of%20Stars%23History">Catalogue of a Second Thousand New Nebulae and Clusters of Stars</a>" published in 1789.

The number of globular clusters discovered continued to increase, reaching 83 in 1915, 93 in 1930 and 97 by 1947. A total of 152 globular clusters have now been discovered in the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> galaxy, out of an estimated total of 180 ± 20. These additional, undiscovered globular clusters are believed to be hidden behind the gas and dust of the Milky Way.

Beginning in 1914, <a href="Harlow%20Shapley">Harlow Shapley</a> began a series of studies of globular clusters, published in about 40 scientific papers. He examined the <a href="RR%20Lyrae%20variable">RR Lyrae variable</a>s in the clusters (which he assumed were <a href="Cepheid%20variable">Cepheid variable</a>s) and used their period–luminosity relationship for distance estimates. Later, it was found that RR Lyrae variables are fainter than Cepheid variables, which caused Shapley to overestimate the distances of the clusters.
Of the globular clusters within the Milky Way, the majority are found in a halo around the galactic core, and the large majority are located in the celestial sky centered on the core. In 1918, this strongly asymmetrical distribution was used by Shapley to make a determination of the overall dimensions of the galaxy. By assuming a roughly spherical distribution of globular clusters around the galaxy's center, he used the positions of the clusters to estimate the position of the Sun relative to the galactic center. While his distance estimate was in significant error (although within the same <a href="order%20of%20magnitude">order of magnitude</a> as the currently accepted value), it did demonstrate that the dimensions of the galaxy were much greater than had been previously thought. His error was due to interstellar dust in the Milky Way, which absorbs and diminishes the amount of light from distant objects, such as globular clusters, that reaches the Earth, thus making them appear to be more distant than they are.

Shapley's measurements also indicated that the Sun is relatively far from the center of the galaxy, also contrary to what had previously been inferred from the apparently nearly even distribution of ordinary stars. In reality, most ordinary stars lie within the galaxy's disk and those stars that lie in the direction of the galactic centre and beyond are thus obscured by gas and dust, whereas globular clusters lie outside the disk and can be seen at much further distances.

Shapley was subsequently assisted in his studies of clusters by <a href="Henrietta%20Hill%20Swope">Henrietta Swope</a> and <a href="Helen%20Sawyer%20Hogg">Helen Battles Sawyer</a> (later Hogg). In 1927–29, Shapley and Sawyer categorized clusters according to the degree of concentration each system has toward its core. The most concentrated clusters were identified as Class I, with successively diminishing concentrations ranging to Class XII. This became known as the <a href="Shapley%E2%80%93Sawyer%20Concentration%20Class">Shapley–Sawyer Concentration Class</a> (it is sometimes given with numbers [Class 1–12] rather than <a href="Roman%20numeral">Roman numeral</a>s.) In 2015, a new type of globular cluster was proposed on the basis of observational data, the <a href="dark%20globular%20cluster">dark globular cluster</a>s.
The formation of globular clusters remains a poorly understood phenomenon and it remains uncertain whether the stars in a globular cluster form in a single generation or are spawned across multiple generations over a period of several hundred million years. In many globular clusters, most of the stars are at approximately the same stage in <a href="stellar%20evolution">stellar evolution</a>, suggesting that they formed at about the same time. However, the star formation history varies from cluster to cluster, with some clusters showing distinct populations of stars. An example of this is the globular clusters in the <a href="Large%20Magellanic%20Cloud">Large Magellanic Cloud</a> (LMC) that exhibit a bimodal population. During their youth, these LMC clusters may have encountered <a href="giant%20molecular%20cloud">giant molecular cloud</a>s that triggered a second round of star formation. This star-forming period is relatively brief, compared to the age of many globular clusters.
It has also been proposed that the reason for this multiplicity in stellar populations could have a dynamical origin. In the <a href="Antennae%20galaxy">Antennae galaxy</a>, for example, the Hubble Space Telescope has observed clusters of clusters, regions in the galaxy that span hundreds of parsecs, where many of the clusters will eventually collide and merge. Many of them present a significant range in ages, hence possibly <a href="Metallicity">metallicities</a>, and their merger could plausibly lead to clusters with a bimodal or even multiple distribution of populations. 

Observations of globular clusters show that these stellar formations arise primarily in regions of efficient star formation, and where the interstellar medium is at a higher density than in normal star-forming regions. Globular cluster formation is prevalent in <a href="Starburst%20%28astronomy%29">starburst</a> regions and in <a href="Interacting%20galaxy">interacting galaxies</a>. Research indicates a correlation between the mass of a central <a href="supermassive%20black%20hole">supermassive black hole</a>s (SMBH) and the extent of the globular cluster systems of <a href="Elliptical%20galaxy">elliptical</a> and <a href="Lenticular%20galaxy">lenticular galaxies</a>. The mass of the SMBH in such a galaxy is often close to the combined mass of the galaxy's globular clusters.

No known globular clusters display active star formation, which is consistent with the view that globular clusters are typically the oldest objects in the Galaxy, and were among the first collections of stars to form. Very large regions of star formation known as <a href="super%20star%20cluster">super star cluster</a>s, such as <a href="Westerlund%201">Westerlund 1</a> in the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>, may be the precursors of globular clusters.

Globular clusters are generally composed of hundreds of thousands of <a href="low-metal">low-metal</a>, old stars. The type of stars found in a globular cluster are similar to those in the <a href="galactic%20bulge">bulge</a> of a <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a> but confined to a volume of only a few million cubic <a href="parsec">parsec</a>s. They are free of gas and dust and it is presumed that all of the gas and dust was long ago turned into stars.

Globular clusters can contain a high density of stars; on average about 0.4 stars per cubic <a href="parsec">parsec</a>, increasing to 100 or 1000 stars per cubic parsec in the core of the cluster. 
The typical distance between stars in a globular cluster is about 1 light year, but at its core, the separation is comparable to the size of the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> (100 to 1000 times closer than stars near the Solar System).

Globular clusters are not thought to be favorable locations for the survival of planetary systems. Planetary orbits are dynamically unstable within the cores of dense clusters because of the perturbations of passing stars. A planet orbiting at 1 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a> around a star that is within the core of a dense cluster such as <a href="47%20Tucanae">47 Tucanae</a> would only survive on the order of 10 years. There is a planetary system orbiting a <a href="pulsar">pulsar</a> (<a href="PSR%20B1620-26">PSR B1620−26</a>) that belongs to the globular cluster <a href="Messier%204">M4</a>, but these planets likely formed after the event that created the pulsar.

Some globular clusters, like <a href="Omega%20Centauri">Omega Centauri</a> in the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> and <a href="Mayall%20II">G1</a> in <a href="Andromeda%20Galaxy">M31</a>, are extraordinarily massive, with several million <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a>es () and multiple stellar populations. Both can be regarded as evidence that supermassive globular clusters are in fact the cores of <a href="Dwarf%20galaxy">dwarf galaxies</a> that are consumed by the larger galaxies. About a quarter of the globular cluster population in the Milky Way may have been accreted along with their host dwarf galaxy.

Several globular clusters (like <a href="Messier%2015">M15</a>) have extremely massive cores which may harbor <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>s, although simulations suggest that a less massive black hole or central concentration of neutron stars or massive white dwarfs explain observations equally well.

Globular clusters normally consist of <a href="Metallicity">Population II stars</a>, which have a low proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium when compared to <a href="Metallicity">Population I</a> stars such as the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>. Astronomers refer to these heavier elements as metals and to the proportions of these elements as the <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a>. These elements are produced by <a href="stellar%20nucleosynthesis">stellar nucleosynthesis</a> and then are recycled into the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a>, where they enter the next generation of stars. Hence the proportion of metals can be an indication of the age of a star, with older stars typically having a lower metallicity.

The <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> astronomer <a href="Pieter%20Oosterhoff">Pieter Oosterhoff</a> noticed that there appear to be two populations of globular clusters, which became known as "Oosterhoff groups". The second group has a slightly longer period of <a href="RR%20Lyrae%20variable">RR Lyrae</a> <a href="variable%20star">variable star</a>s. Both groups have weak <a href="Spectral%20line">lines of metallic elements</a>. But the lines in the stars of Oosterhoff type I (OoI) cluster are not quite as weak as those in type II (OoII). Hence type I are referred to as "metal-rich" (for example, <a href="Terzan%207">Terzan 7</a>), while type II are "metal-poor" (for example, <a href="ESO%20280-SC06">ESO 280-SC06</a>).

These two populations have been observed in many galaxies, especially massive <a href="elliptical%20galaxy">elliptical galaxies</a>. Both groups are nearly as old as the universe itself and are of similar ages, but differ in their metal abundances. Many scenarios have been suggested to explain these subpopulations, including violent gas-rich galaxy mergers, the accretion of dwarf galaxies, and multiple phases of star formation in a single galaxy. In the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>, the metal-poor clusters are associated with the halo and the metal-rich clusters with the bulge.

In the Milky Way it has been discovered that the large majority of the low metallicity clusters are aligned along a plane in the outer part of the galaxy's halo. This result argues in favor of the view that type II clusters in the galaxy were captured from a satellite galaxy, rather than being the oldest members of the Milky Way's globular cluster system as had been previously thought. The difference between the two cluster types would then be explained by a time delay between when the two galaxies formed their cluster systems.

Globular clusters have a very high star density, and therefore close interactions and near-collisions of stars occur relatively often. Due to these chance encounters, some exotic classes of stars, such as <a href="blue%20straggler">blue straggler</a>s, <a href="millisecond%20pulsar">millisecond pulsar</a>s and <a href="low-mass%20X-ray%20binaries">low-mass X-ray binaries</a>, are much more common in globular clusters. A blue straggler is formed from the merger of two stars, possibly as a result of an encounter with a binary system. The resulting star has a higher temperature than comparable stars in the cluster with the same luminosity, and thus differs from the <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> stars formed at the beginning of the cluster.
Astronomers have searched for <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>s within globular clusters since the 1970s. The resolution requirements for this task, however, are exacting, and it is only with the <a href="Hubble%20space%20telescope">Hubble space telescope</a> that the first confirmed discoveries have been made. In independent programs, a <a href="intermediate-mass%20black%20hole">intermediate-mass black hole</a> has been suggested to exist based on HST observations in the globular cluster <a href="Messier%2015">M15</a> and a black hole in the <a href="Mayall%20II">Mayall II</a> cluster in the <a href="Andromeda%20Galaxy">Andromeda Galaxy</a>. Both <a href="x-ray">x-ray</a> and <a href="radio">radio</a> emissions from Mayall II appear to be consistent with an intermediate-mass black hole.

They are the first black holes discovered that were intermediate in mass between the conventional <a href="star">stellar</a>-mass black hole and the <a href="supermassive%20black%20hole">supermassive black hole</a>s discovered at the cores of galaxies. The mass of these intermediate mass black holes is proportional to the mass of the clusters, following a pattern previously discovered between supermassive black holes and their surrounding galaxies.

Claims of intermediate mass black holes have been met with some skepticism. The heaviest objects in globular clusters are expected to migrate to the cluster center due to <a href="mass%20segregation">mass segregation</a>. As pointed out in two papers by Holger Baumgardt and collaborators, the mass-to-light ratio should rise sharply towards the center of the cluster, even without a black hole, in both M15 and Mayall II.

The <a href="Hertzsprung-Russell%20diagram">Hertzsprung-Russell diagram</a> (HR-diagram) is a graph of a large sample of stars that plots their visual
<a href="absolute%20magnitude">absolute magnitude</a> against their <a href="color%20index">color index</a>. The
color index, B−V, is the difference between the magnitude of the star in blue light, or B, and the magnitude in visual light (green-yellow), or V. Large positive values indicate a red star with a cool surface <a href="temperature">temperature</a>, while negative values imply a blue star with a hotter surface.

When the stars near the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> are plotted on an HR diagram, it displays a distribution of stars of various masses, ages, and compositions. Many of the stars lie relatively close to a sloping curve with increasing absolute magnitude as the stars are hotter, known as <a href="main%20sequence">main-sequence</a> stars. However the diagram also typically includes stars that are in later stages of their evolution and have wandered away from this main-sequence curve.

As all the stars of a globular cluster are at approximately the same distance from the Earth, their absolute magnitudes differ from their <a href="visual%20magnitude">visual magnitude</a> by about the same amount. The main-sequence stars in the globular cluster will fall along a line that is believed to be comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as <a href="RR%20Lyrae">RR Lyrae</a> stars and <a href="cepheid%20variable">cepheid variable</a>s, with those in the cluster.

By matching up these curves on the HR diagram the absolute magnitude of main-sequence stars in the cluster can also be determined. This in turn provides a distance estimate to the cluster, based on the visual magnitude of the stars. The difference between the relative and absolute magnitude, the "<a href="distance%20modulus">distance modulus</a>", yields this estimate of the distance.

When the stars of a particular globular cluster are plotted on an HR diagram, in many cases nearly all of the stars fall upon a relatively well-defined curve. This differs from the HR diagram of stars near the Sun, which lumps together stars of differing ages and origins. The shape of the curve for a globular cluster is characteristic of a grouping of stars that were formed at approximately the same time and from the same materials, differing only in their initial mass. As the position of each star in the HR diagram varies with age, the shape of the curve for a globular cluster can be used to measure the overall age of the star population.

However, the above-mentioned historic process of determining the age and distance to globular clusters is not as robust as first thought, since the morphology and luminosity of globular cluster stars in color-magnitude diagrams are influenced by numerous parameters, many of which are still being actively researched. Certain clusters even display populations that are absent from other globular clusters (e.g., blue hook stars), or feature multiple populations. The historical paradigm that all globular clusters consist of stars born at exactly the same time, or sharing exactly the same chemical abundance, has likewise been overturned (e.g., NGC 2808). Further, the morphology of the cluster stars in a color-magnitude diagram, and that includes the brightnesses of distance indicators such as <a href="RR%20Lyrae%20variable">RR Lyrae variable</a> members, can be influenced by observational biases. One such effect is called blending, and it arises because the cores of globular clusters are so dense that in low-resolution observations multiple (unresolved) stars may appear as a single target. Thus the brightness measured for that seemingly single star (e.g., an RR Lyrae variable) is erroneously too bright, given those unresolved stars contributed to the brightness determined. Consequently, the computed distance is wrong, and more importantly, certain researchers have argued that the blending effect can introduce a systematic uncertainty into the <a href="cosmic%20distance%20ladder">cosmic distance ladder</a>, and may bias the estimated age of the Universe and the <a href="Hubble%20constant">Hubble constant</a>.
The most massive main-sequence stars will also have the highest absolute magnitude, and these will be the first to evolve into the <a href="giant%20star">giant star</a> stage. As the cluster ages, stars of successively lower masses will also enter the <a href="giant%20star">giant star</a> stage. Thus the age of a single population cluster can be measured by looking for the stars that are just beginning to enter the giant star stage. This forms a "knee" in the HR diagram, bending to the upper right from the main-sequence line. The absolute magnitude at this bend is directly a function of the age of globular cluster, so an age scale can be plotted on an axis parallel to the magnitude.

In addition, globular clusters can be dated by looking at the temperatures of the coolest white dwarfs. Typical results for globular clusters are that they may be as old as 12.7 <a href="1000000000%20%28number%29">billion</a> years. This is in contrast to open clusters which are only tens of millions of years old.

The ages of globular clusters place a bound on the age limit of the entire universe. This lower limit has been a significant constraint in <a href="physical%20cosmology">cosmology</a>. Historically, astronomers were faced with age estimates of globular clusters that appeared older than cosmological models would allow. However, better measurements of cosmological parameters through deep sky surveys and satellites such as the Hubble Space Telescope appear to have resolved this issue.

Evolutionary studies of globular clusters can also be used to determine changes due to the starting composition of the gas and dust that formed the cluster. That is, the <a href="evolutionary%20track">evolutionary track</a>s change with changes in the abundance of heavy elements. The data obtained from studies of globular clusters are then used to study the evolution of the Milky Way as a whole.

In globular clusters a few stars known as <a href="blue%20straggler">blue straggler</a>s are observed, apparently continuing the main sequence in the direction of brighter, bluer stars. The origins of these stars is still unclear, but most models suggest that these stars are the result of mass transfer in multiple star systems.

In contrast to open clusters, most globular clusters remain gravitationally bound for time periods comparable to the life spans of the majority of their stars. However, a possible exception is when strong tidal interactions with other large masses result in the dispersal of the stars.

After they are formed, the stars in the globular cluster begin to interact gravitationally with each other. As a result, the velocity vectors of the stars are steadily modified, and the stars lose any history of their original velocity. The characteristic interval for this to occur is the <a href="relaxation%20time">relaxation time</a>. This is related to the characteristic length of time a star needs to cross the cluster as well as the number of stellar masses in the system. The value of the relaxation time varies by cluster, but the mean value is on the order of 10 years.
Although globular clusters generally appear spherical in form, ellipticities can occur due to tidal interactions. Clusters within the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are typically <a href="oblate%20spheroid">oblate spheroid</a>s in shape, while those in the <a href="Large%20Magellanic%20Cloud">Large Magellanic Cloud</a> are more elliptical.

Astronomers characterize the morphology of a globular cluster by means of standard radii. These are the core radius ("r"), the <a href="Effective%20radius">half-light radius</a> ("r"), and the tidal (or Jacobi) radius ("r"). The overall luminosity of the cluster steadily decreases with distance from the core, and the core radius is the distance at which the apparent surface luminosity has dropped by half. A comparable quantity is the half-light radius, or the distance from the core within which half the total luminosity from the cluster is received. This is typically larger than the core radius.

The half-light radius includes stars in the outer part of the cluster that happen to lie along the line of sight, so theorists will also use the half-mass radius ("r")—the radius from the core that contains half the total mass of the cluster. When the half-mass radius of a cluster is small relative to the overall size, it has a dense core. An example of this is <a href="Messier%203">Messier 3</a> (M3), which has an overall visible dimension of about 18 <a href="arc%20minute">arc minute</a>s, but a half-mass radius of only 1.12 arc minutes.

Almost all globular clusters have a half-light radius of less than 10 <a href="parsec">pc</a>, although there are well-established globular clusters with very large radii (i.e. <a href="NGC%202419">NGC 2419</a> (R = 18 pc) and <a href="Palomar%2014">Palomar 14</a> (R = 25 pc)).

Finally the tidal radius, or <a href="Hill%20sphere">Hill sphere</a>, is the distance from the center of the globular cluster at which the external gravitation of the galaxy has more influence over the stars in the cluster than does the cluster itself. This is the distance at which the individual stars belonging to a cluster can be separated away by the galaxy. The tidal radius of M3 is about 40 arc minutes, or about 113 pc at the distance of 10.4 kpc.

In measuring the luminosity curve of a given globular cluster as a function of distance from the core, most clusters in the Milky Way increase steadily in luminosity as this distance decreases, up to a certain distance from the core, then the luminosity levels off. Typically this distance is about 1–2 parsecs from the core. However about 20% of the globular clusters have undergone a process termed "core collapse". In this type of cluster, the luminosity continues to increase steadily all the way to the core region. An example of a core-collapsed globular is
<a href="Messier%2015">M15</a>.
Core-collapse is thought to occur when the more massive stars in a globular cluster encounter their less massive companions. Over time, dynamic processes cause individual stars to migrate from the center of the cluster to the outside. This results in a net loss of <a href="kinetic%20energy">kinetic energy</a> from the core region, leading the remaining stars grouped in the core region to occupy a more compact volume. When this gravothermal instability occurs, the central region of the cluster becomes densely crowded with stars and the <a href="surface%20brightness">surface brightness</a> of the cluster forms a <a href="power-law">power-law</a> cusp. (Note that a core collapse is not the only mechanism that can cause such a luminosity distribution; a massive <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a> at the core can also result in a luminosity cusp.) Over a lengthy period of time this leads to a concentration of massive stars near the core, a phenomenon called <a href="mass%20segregation">mass segregation</a>.

The dynamical heating effect of binary star systems works to prevent an initial core collapse of the cluster. When a star passes near a binary system, the orbit of the latter pair tends to contract, releasing energy. Only after the primordial supply of binaries is exhausted due to interactions can a deeper core collapse proceed. In contrast, the effect of <a href="tidal%20shock">tidal shock</a>s as a globular cluster repeatedly passes through the plane of a <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a> tends to significantly accelerate core collapse.

The different stages of core-collapse may be divided into three phases. During a globular cluster's adolescence, the process of core-collapse begins with stars near the core. However, the interactions between <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> systems prevents further collapse as the cluster approaches middle age. Finally, the central binaries are either disrupted or ejected, resulting in a tighter concentration at the core.

The interaction of stars in the collapsed core region causes tight binary systems to form. As other stars interact with these tight binaries, they increase the energy at the core, which causes the cluster to re-expand. As the mean time for a core collapse is typically less than the age of the galaxy, many of a galaxy's globular clusters may have passed through a core collapse stage, then re-expanded.

The Hubble Space Telescope has been used to provide convincing observational evidence of this stellar mass-sorting process in globular clusters. Heavier stars slow down and crowd at the cluster's core, while lighter stars pick up speed and tend to spend more time at the cluster's periphery. The globular star cluster <a href="47%20Tucanae">47 Tucanae</a>, which is made up of about 1 million stars, is one of the densest globular clusters in the Southern Hemisphere. This cluster was subjected to an intensive photographic survey, which allowed astronomers to track the motion of its stars. Precise velocities were obtained for nearly 15,000 stars in this cluster.

A 2008 study by John Fregeau of 13 globular clusters in the Milky Way shows that three of them have an unusually large number of X-ray sources, or X-ray binaries, suggesting the clusters are middle-aged. Previously, these globular clusters had been classified as being in old age because they had very tight concentrations of stars in their centers, another test of age used by astronomers. The implication is that most globular clusters, including the other ten studied by Fregeau, are not in middle age as previously thought, but are actually in 'adolescence'.

The overall luminosities of the globular clusters within the Milky Way and the <a href="Andromeda%20Galaxy">Andromeda Galaxy</a> can be modeled by means of a <a href="gaussian%20curve">gaussian curve</a>. This gaussian can be represented by means of an average magnitude M and a variance σ. This distribution of globular cluster luminosities is called the Globular Cluster Luminosity Function (GCLF). (For the Milky Way, M = , σ = magnitudes.) The GCLF has also been used as a "<a href="standard%20candle">standard candle</a>" for measuring the distance to other galaxies, under the assumption that the globular clusters in remote galaxies follow the same principles as they do in the Milky Way.

Computing the interactions between the stars within a globular cluster requires solving what is termed the <a href="N-body%20problem">N-body problem</a>. That is, each of the stars within the cluster continually interacts with the other "N"−1 stars, where "N" is the total number of stars in the cluster. The naive <a href="CPU">CPU</a> computational "cost" for a dynamic simulation increases in proportion to "N" (each of N objects must interact pairwise with each of the other N objects), so the potential computing requirements to accurately simulate such a cluster can be enormous. An efficient method of mathematically simulating the N-body dynamics of a globular cluster is done by subdividing into small volumes and velocity ranges, and using probabilities to describe the locations of the stars. The motions are then described by means of a formula called the <a href="Fokker%E2%80%93Planck%20equation">Fokker–Planck equation</a>. This can be solved by a simplified form of the equation, or by running <a href="Monte%20Carlo%20simulation">Monte Carlo simulation</a>s and using random values. However the simulation becomes more difficult when the effects of binaries and the interaction with external gravitation forces (such as from the Milky Way galaxy) must also be included.

The results of N-body simulations have shown that the stars can follow unusual paths through the cluster, often forming loops and often falling more directly toward the core than would a single star orbiting a central mass. In addition, due to interactions with other stars that result in an increase in velocity, some of the stars gain sufficient energy to escape the cluster. Over long periods of time this will result in a dissipation of the cluster, a process termed evaporation. The typical time scale for the evaporation of a globular cluster is 10 years. In 2010 it became possible to directly compute, star by star, N-body simulations of a globular cluster over the course of its lifetime.

<a href="Binary%20stars">Binary stars</a> form a significant portion of the total population of stellar systems, with up to half of all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.

The ultimate fate of a globular cluster must be either to accrete stars at its core, causing its steady contraction, or gradual shedding of stars from its outer layers.

The distinction between cluster types is not always
clear-cut, and objects have been found that blur the
lines between the categories. For example, BH 176
in the southern part of the Milky Way has properties
of both an open and a globular cluster.

In 2005, astronomers discovered a completely new type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy, which is, in several ways, very similar to globular clusters. The new-found clusters contain hundreds of thousands of stars, a similar number to that found in globular clusters. The clusters share other characteristics with globular clusters such as stellar populations and metallicity. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger – several hundred light-years across – and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters. Parametrically, these clusters lie somewhere between a globular cluster and a <a href="dwarf%20spheroidal%20galaxy">dwarf spheroidal galaxy</a>.

How these clusters are formed is not yet known, but their formation might well be related to that of globular clusters. Why M31 has such clusters, while the Milky Way does not, is not yet known. It is also unknown if any other galaxy contains these types of clusters, but it would be very unlikely that M31 is the sole galaxy with extended clusters.

When a globular cluster has a close encounter with a large mass, such as the core region of a galaxy, it undergoes a tidal interaction. The difference in the pull of gravity between the part of the cluster nearest the mass and the pull on the furthest part of the cluster results in a <a href="tidal%20force">tidal force</a>. A "tidal shock" occurs whenever the orbit of a cluster takes it through the plane of a galaxy.

As a result of a tidal shock, streams of stars can be pulled away from the cluster halo, leaving only the core part of the cluster. These tidal interaction effects create tails of stars that can extend up to several degrees of arc away from the cluster. These tails typically both precede and follow the cluster along its orbit. The tails can accumulate significant portions of the original mass of the cluster, and can form clumplike features.

The globular cluster <a href="Palomar%205">Palomar 5</a>, for example, is near the <a href="apsis">apogalactic point</a> of its orbit after passing through the Milky Way. Streams of stars extend outward toward the front and rear of the orbital path of this cluster, stretching out to distances of 13,000 light-years. Tidal interactions have stripped away much of the mass from Palomar 5, and further interactions as it passes through the galactic core are expected to transform it into a long stream of stars orbiting the Milky Way halo.

Tidal interactions add kinetic energy into a globular cluster, dramatically increasing the evaporation rate and shrinking the size of the cluster. Not only does tidal shock strip off the outer stars from a globular cluster, but the increased evaporation accelerates the process of core collapse. The same physical mechanism may be at work in <a href="Dwarf%20spheroidal%20galaxy">dwarf spheroidal galaxies</a> such as the Sagittarius Dwarf, which appears to be undergoing tidal disruption due to its proximity to the Milky Way.

There are many globular clusters with a <a href="retrograde%20orbit">retrograde orbit</a> round the Milky Way Galaxy. A <a href="hypervelocity%20globular%20cluster">hypervelocity globular cluster</a> was discovered around <a href="Messier%2087">Messier 87</a> in 2014, having a velocity in excess of the <a href="escape%20velocity">escape velocity</a> of M87.

Astronomers are searching for exoplanets of stars in globular star clusters.

In 2000, the results of a search for <a href="giant%20planet">giant planet</a>s in the globular cluster <a href="47%20Tucanae">47 Tucanae</a> were announced. The lack of any successful discoveries suggests that the abundance of elements (other than hydrogen or helium) necessary to build these planets may need to be at least 40% of the abundance in the Sun. <a href="Terrestrial%20planet">Terrestrial planet</a>s are built from heavier elements such as silicon, iron and magnesium. The very low abundance of these elements in globular clusters means that the member stars have a far lower likelihood of hosting Earth-mass planets, when compared to stars in the neighborhood of the Sun. Hence the halo region of the Milky Way galaxy, including globular cluster members, are unlikely to host <a href="habitable%20planet">habitable terrestrial planet</a>s.

In spite of the lower likelihood of giant planet formation, just such an object has been found in the globular cluster <a href="Messier%204">Messier 4</a>. This planet was detected orbiting a <a href="pulsar">pulsar</a> in the <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> system <a href="PSR%20B1620-26">PSR B1620-26</a>. The <a href="Orbital%20eccentricity">eccentric</a> and highly <a href="inclination">inclined</a> orbit of the planet suggests it may have been formed around another star in the cluster, then was later "exchanged" into its current arrangement. The likelihood of close encounters between stars in a globular cluster can disrupt planetary systems, some of which break loose to become <a href="free%20floating%20planet">free floating planet</a>s. Even close orbiting planets can become disrupted, potentially leading to <a href="orbital%20decay">orbital decay</a> and an increase in orbital eccentricity and tidal effects.

George Fox

George Fox (July 1624 – 13 January 1691) was an <a href="English%20Dissenters">English Dissenter</a>, who was a founder of the <a href="Religious%20Society%20of%20Friends">Religious Society of Friends</a>, commonly known as the Quakers or Friends. The son of a <a href="Leicestershire">Leicestershire</a> <a href="Weaver%20%28occupation%29">weaver</a>, he lived in times of social upheaval and war. He rebelled against the <a href="Religion">religious</a> and political authorities by proposing an unusual, uncompromising approach to the <a href="Christianity">Christian faith</a>. He travelled throughout Britain as a dissenting preacher, often being persecuted by the disapproving authorities. In 1669, he married <a href="Margaret%20Fell">Margaret Fell</a>, widow of a wealthy supporter, <a href="Thomas%20Fell">Thomas Fell</a>; she was a leading Friend. His ministry expanded and he made tours of <a href="North%20America">North America</a> and the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a>. He was arrested and jailed numerous times for his beliefs. He spent his final decade working in London to organize the expanding Quaker movement. Despite disdain from some Anglicans and Puritans, he was viewed with respect by the Quaker convert <a href="William%20Penn">William Penn</a> and the Lord Protector, <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>.

George Fox was born in the strongly <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> village of Drayton-in-the-Clay, Leicestershire, England (now known as <a href="Fenny%20Drayton">Fenny Drayton</a>), 15 miles (24 km) west-south-west of <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a>. He was the eldest of four children of Christopher Fox, a successful <a href="weaving">weaver</a>, called "Righteous Christer" by his neighbours, and his wife, Mary Lago. Christopher Fox was a churchwarden and was relatively wealthy; when he died in the late 1650s he left his son a substantial legacy. From childhood Fox was of a serious, religious disposition. There is no record of any formal schooling but he learned to read and write. "When I came to eleven years of age", he said, "I knew pureness and righteousness; for, while I was a child, I was taught how to walk to be kept pure. The Lord taught me to be faithful, in all things, and to act faithfully two ways; viz., inwardly to God, and outwardly to man." Known as an honest person, he also proclaimed, "The Lord taught me to be faithful in all things...and to keep to Yea and Nay in all things."

As he grew up, his relatives "thought to have made me a priest" but he was instead apprenticed to a local <a href="shoemaking">shoemaker</a> and <a href="Pastoral%20farming">grazier</a>, George Gee of <a href="Mancetter">Mancetter</a>. This suited his contemplative temperament and he became well known for his diligence among the wool traders who had dealings with his master. A constant obsession for Fox was the pursuit of "simplicity" in life, meaning humility and the abandonment of luxury, and the short time he spent as a <a href="shepherd">shepherd</a> was important to the formation of this view. Toward the end of his life he wrote a letter for general circulation pointing out that <a href="Cain%20and%20Abel">Abel</a>, <a href="Noah">Noah</a>, <a href="Abraham">Abraham</a>, <a href="Jacob">Jacob</a>, <a href="Moses">Moses</a> and <a href="David">David</a> were all keepers of sheep or cattle and therefore that a learned education should not be seen as a necessary qualification for ministry.

George Fox knew people who were "professors" (followers of the standard religion), but by the age of 19 he had begun to look down on their behaviour, in particular drinking alcohol. He records that, in prayer one night after leaving two acquaintances at a drinking session, he heard an inner voice saying, "Thou seest how young people go together into vanity, and old people into the earth; thou must forsake all, young and old, keep out of all, and be as a stranger unto all."

Driven by his "inner voice", Fox left Drayton-in-the-Clay in September 1643, moving toward London in a state of mental torment and confusion. The <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> had begun and troops were stationed in many towns through which he passed. In <a href="Chipping%20Barnet">Barnet</a>, he was torn by depression (perhaps from the temptations of the resort town near London). He alternately shut himself in his room for days at a time or went out alone into the countryside. After almost a year he returned to Drayton, where he engaged <a href="Nathaniel%20Stephens%20%28clergyman%29">Nathaniel Stephens</a>, the clergyman of his hometown, in long discussions on religious matters. Stephens considered Fox a gifted young man but the two disagreed on so many issues that he later called Fox mad and spoke against him.

Over the next few years Fox continued to travel around the country as his particular religious beliefs took shape. At times he actively sought the company of clergy but found no comfort from them as they seemed unable to help with the matters troubling him. One, in <a href="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a>, advised him to take <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a> (which Fox disliked) and sing <a href="psalms">psalms</a>; another, in <a href="Coventry">Coventry</a>, lost his temper when Fox accidentally stood on a flower in his garden; a third suggested <a href="bloodletting">bloodletting</a>. He became fascinated by the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>, which he studied assiduously. He hoped to find among the "<a href="English%20Dissenters">English Dissenters</a>" a spiritual understanding absent from the established church but fell out with one group, for example, because he maintained that women had souls:

He thought intensely about the <a href="Temptation%20of%20Christ">Temptation of Christ</a>, which he compared to his own spiritual condition, but drew strength from his conviction that God would support and preserve him. In prayer and meditation he came to a greater understanding of the nature of his faith and what it required from him; this process he called "opening". He also came to what he deemed a deep inner understanding of standard Christian beliefs. Among his ideas were:


In 1647 Fox began to preach publicly: in market-places, fields, appointed meetings of various kinds or even sometimes "steeple-houses" after the service. His powerful preaching began to attract a small following. It is not clear at what point the Society of Friends was formed but there was certainly a group of people who often travelled together. At first, they called themselves "Children of the Light" or "Friends of the Truth", and later simply "Friends". Fox seems to have initially had no desire to found a sect but only to proclaim what he saw as the pure and genuine principles of <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> in their original simplicity, though he afterward showed great prowess as a religious organisor in the structure he gave to the new society.

There were a great many rival <a href="Christian%20denomination">Christian denomination</a>s holding very diverse opinions; the atmosphere of dispute and confusion gave Fox an opportunity to put forward his own beliefs through his personal sermons. Fox's preaching was grounded in scripture but was mainly effective because of the intense personal experience he was able to project. He was scathing about immorality, deceit and the exacting of <a href="tithe">tithe</a>s and urged his listeners to lead lives without sin, avoiding the <a href="Ranters">Ranter</a>'s <a href="antinomian">antinomian</a> view that a believer becomes automatically sinless. By 1651 he had gathered other talented preachers around him and continued to roam the country despite a harsh reception from some listeners, who would whip and beat them to drive them away. As his reputation spread, his words were not welcomed by all. As an uncompromising preacher, he hurled disputation and contradiction to the faces of his opponents. The worship of Friends in the form of silent waiting punctuated by individuals speaking as the Spirit moved them seems to have been well-established by this time, though it is not recorded how this came to be; <a href="Richard%20Bauman">Richard Bauman</a> asserts that "speaking was an important feature of the meeting for worship from the earliest days of Quakerism."

Fox complained to judges about decisions he considered morally wrong, as in his letter on the case of a woman due to be <a href="Capital%20punishment">executed</a> for theft. He campaigned against the paying of tithes, which funded the established church and often went into the pockets of absentee landlords or religious colleges far away from the paying parishioners. In his view, as God was everywhere and anyone could preach, the established church was unnecessary and a university qualification irrelevant for a preacher. Conflict with civil authority was inevitable. Fox was imprisoned several times, the first at <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> in 1649. At <a href="Derby">Derby</a> in 1650 he was imprisoned for <a href="blasphemy">blasphemy</a>; a judge mocked Fox's exhortation to "tremble at the word of the Lord", calling him and his followers "Quakers". Following his refusal to fight against the return of the monarchy (or to take up arms for any reason), his sentence was doubled. The refusal to swear oaths or take up arms came to be a much more important part of his public statements. Refusal to take oaths meant that Quakers could be prosecuted under laws compelling subjects to <a href="Oath%20of%20allegiance">pledge allegiance</a>, as well as making testifying in court problematic. In a letter of 1652 ("That which is set up by the sword"), he urged Friends not to use "carnal weapons" but "spiritual weapons", saying "let the waves [the power of nations] break over your heads".

In 1652, Fox preached for several hours under a walnut tree at <a href="Balby">Balby</a>, where his disciple <a href="Thomas%20Aldham">Thomas Aldham</a> was instrumental in setting up the first meeting in the <a href="Doncaster">Doncaster</a> area. In the same year Fox felt that God led him to ascend <a href="Pendle%20Hill">Pendle Hill</a> where he had a vision of many souls coming to Christ. From there he travelled to <a href="Sedbergh">Sedbergh</a>, where he had heard a group of <a href="Seekers">Seekers</a> were meeting, and preached to over a thousand people on <a href="Firbank%20Fell">Firbank Fell</a>, convincing many, including <a href="Francis%20Howgill">Francis Howgill</a>, to accept that Christ might speak to people directly. At the end of the month he stayed at <a href="Swarthmoor%20Hall">Swarthmoor Hall</a>, near <a href="Ulverston">Ulverston</a>, the home of Thomas Fell, vice-chancellor of the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Lancaster">Duchy of Lancaster</a>, and his wife, Margaret. At around this time the "ad hoc" meetings of Friends began to be formalized and a monthly meeting was set up in <a href="County%20Durham">County Durham</a>. Margaret became a Quaker and, although Thomas did not convert, his familiarity with the Friends proved influential when Fox was arrested for blasphemy in October. Fell was one of three presiding judges, and had the charges dismissed on a technicality.

Fox remained at <a href="Swarthmoor">Swarthmoor</a> until summer 1653 then left for <a href="Carlisle%2C%20Cumbria">Carlisle</a> where he was arrested again for blasphemy. It was even proposed to put him to death but <a href="Barebone%27s%20Parliament">Parliament</a> requested his release rather than have "a young man ... die for religion". Further imprisonments came at <a href="London">London</a>, England in 1654, <a href="Launceston%2C%20England">Launceston</a> in 1656, <a href="Lancaster%2C%20England">Lancaster</a> in 1660, <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a> in 1662, Lancaster again and <a href="Scarborough%2C%20England">Scarborough</a> in 1664–1666 and <a href="Worcester%2C%20England">Worcester</a> in 1673–1675. Charges usually included causing a disturbance and travelling without a pass. Quakers fell foul of irregularly enforced laws forbidding unauthorized worship while actions motivated by belief in social equality—refusing to use or acknowledge titles, take hats off in court or bow to those who considered themselves socially superior—were seen as disrespectful. While imprisoned at Launceston Fox wrote, "Christ our Lord and master saith 'Swear not at all, but let your communications be yea, yea, and nay, nay, for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.' ... the Apostle James saith, 'My brethren, above all things swear not, neither by heaven, nor by earth, nor by any other oath. Lest ye fall into condemnation.'"

In prison George Fox continued writing and preaching, feeling that imprisonment brought him into contact with people who needed his help—the jailers as well as his fellow prisoners. In his journal, he told his magistrate, "God dwells not in temples made with hands." He also sought to set an example by his actions there, turning the other cheek when being beaten and refusing to show his captors any dejected feelings.

Parliamentarians grew suspicious of monarchist plots and fearful that the group travelling with Fox aimed to overthrow the government: by this time his meetings were regularly attracting crowds of over a thousand. In early 1655 he was arrested at <a href="Whetstone%2C%20Leicestershire">Whetstone, Leicestershire</a> and taken to London under armed guard. In March he was brought before the <a href="Lord%20Protector">Lord Protector</a>, <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>. After affirming that he had no intention of taking up arms Fox was able to speak with Cromwell for most of the morning about the Friends and advised him to listen to God's voice and obey it so that, as Fox left, Cromwell "with tears in his eyes said, 'Come again to my house; for if thou and I were but an hour of a day together, we should be nearer one to the other'; adding that he wished [Fox] no more ill than he did to his own soul."

This episode was later recalled as an example of "speaking truth to power", a preaching technique by which subsequent Quakers hoped to influence the powerful. Although not used until the 20th century, the phrase is related to the ideas of plain speech and simplicity which Fox practiced, but motivated by the more worldly goal of eradicating war, injustice and oppression.

Fox petitioned Cromwell over the course of 1656, asking him to alleviate the persecution of Quakers. Later that year, they met for a second time at Whitehall. On a personal level, the meeting went well; despite disagreements between the two men, they had a certain rapport. Fox invited Cromwell to "lay down his crown at the feet of Jesus"—which Cromwell declined to do. Fox met Cromwell again twice in March 1657. Their last meeting was in 1658 at <a href="Hampton%20Court">Hampton Court</a>, though they could not speak for long or meet again because of the Protector's worsening illness—Fox even wrote that "he looked like a dead man". Cromwell died in September of that year.

One early Quaker convert, the Yorkshireman <a href="James%20Nayler">James Nayler</a>, arose as a prominent preacher in London around 1655. A breach began to form between Fox's and Nayler's followers. As Fox was held prisoner at Launceston, Nayler moved south-westwards towards Launceston intending to meet Fox and heal any rift. On the way he was arrested himself and held at <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>. After Fox was released from Launceston gaol in 1656, he preached throughout the <a href="West%20Country">West Country</a>. Arriving at Exeter late in September, Fox was reunited with Nayler. Nayler and his followers refused to remove their hats while Fox prayed, which Fox took as both a personal slight and a bad example. When Nayler refused to kiss Fox's hand, Fox told Nayler to kiss his foot instead. Nayler was offended and the two parted acrimoniously. Fox wrote, "there was now a wicked spirit risen amongst Friends".

After Nayler's own release later the same year he rode into <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> triumphantly playing the part of Jesus Christ in a re-enactment of <a href="Palm%20Sunday">Palm Sunday</a>. He was arrested and taken to London, where Parliament defeated a motion to execute him by 96–82. Instead, they ordered that he be pilloried and whipped through both London and Bristol, branded on his forehead with the letter B (for blasphemer), bored through the tongue with a red-hot iron and imprisoned in solitary confinement with hard labour. Nayler was released in 1659, but he was a broken man. On meeting Fox in London, he fell to his knees and begged Fox's forgiveness. Shortly afterward, Nayler was attacked by thieves while travelling home to his family, and died.

The persecutions of these years—with about a thousand Friends in prison by 1657—hardened Fox's opinions of traditional religious and social practices. In his preaching, he often emphasized the Quaker rejection of <a href="baptism">baptism</a> by water; this was a useful way of highlighting how the focus of Friends on inward transformation differed from what he saw as the superstition of outward ritual. It was also deliberately provocative to adherents of those practices, providing opportunities for Fox to argue with them on matters of scripture. This pattern was also found in his court appearances: when a judge challenged him to remove his hat, Fox riposted by asking where in the Bible such an injunction could be found.

The Society of Friends became increasingly organized towards the end of the decade. Large meetings were held, including a three-day event in Bedfordshire, the precursor of the present <a href="Britain%20Yearly%20Meeting">Britain Yearly Meeting</a> system. Fox commissioned two Friends to travel around the country collecting the testimonies of imprisoned Quakers, as evidence of their persecution; this led to the establishment in 1675 of <a href="Meeting%20for%20Sufferings">Meeting for Sufferings</a>, which has continued to the present day.

The 1650s, when the Friends were most confrontational, was one of the most creative periods of their history. During the Commonwealth, Fox had hoped that the movement would become the major church in England. Disagreements, persecution and increasing social turmoil, however, led Fox to suffer from a severe depression, which left him deeply troubled at <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading, Berkshire</a>, for ten weeks in 1658 or 1659. In 1659, he sent <a href="Rump%20Parliament">parliament</a> his most politically radical pamphlet, "<a href="Fifty%20nine%20Particulars%20laid%20down%20for%20the%20Regulating%20things">Fifty nine Particulars laid down for the Regulating things</a>", but the year was so chaotic that it never considered them; the document was not reprinted until the 21st century.

With the <a href="English%20Restoration">restoration of the monarchy</a>, Fox's dreams of establishing the Friends as the dominant religion seemed at an end. He was again accused of conspiracy, this time against <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a>, and fanaticism—a charge he resented. He was imprisoned in Lancaster for five months, during which he wrote to the king offering advice on governance: Charles should refrain from war and domestic religious persecution, and discourage oath-taking, <a href="Play%20%28theatre%29">plays</a>, and <a href="maypole">maypole</a> games. These last suggestions reveal Fox's <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> leanings, which continued to influence Quakers for centuries after his death. Once again, Fox was released after demonstrating that he had no military ambitions.

At least on one point, Charles listened to Fox. The seven hundred Quakers who had been imprisoned under <a href="Richard%20Cromwell">Richard Cromwell</a> were released, though the government remained uncertain about the group's links with other, more violent, movements. A revolt by the <a href="Fifth%20Monarchists">Fifth Monarchists</a> in January 1661 led to the suppression of that sect and the repression of other <a href="Nonconformist">Nonconformist</a>s, including Quakers. In the aftermath of this attempted coup, Fox and eleven other Quakers issued a broadside proclaiming what became known among Friends in the 20th century as the "peace testimony": they committed themselves to oppose all outward wars and strife as contrary to the will of God. Not all his followers accepted this statement; <a href="Isaac%20Penington%20%28Quaker%29">Isaac Penington</a>, for example, dissented for a time arguing that the state had a duty to protect the innocent from evil, if necessary by using military force. Despite the testimony, persecution against Quakers and other dissenters continued.

Penington and others, such as John Perrot and John Pennyman, were uneasy at Fox's increasing power within the movement. Like Nayler before them, they saw no reason why men should remove their hats for prayer, arguing that men and women should be treated as equals and if, as according to the apostle Paul, women should cover their heads, then so could men. Perrot and Penington lost the argument. Perrot emigrated to the New World, and Fox retained leadership of the movement.

Parliament enacted laws which forbade non-Anglican religious meetings of more than five people, essentially making Quaker meetings illegal. Fox counseled his followers to openly violate laws that attempted to suppress the movement, and many Friends, including women and children, were jailed over the next two and a half decades. Meanwhile, Quakers in <a href="New%20England">New England</a> had been banished (and some <a href="Boston%20martyrs">executed</a>), and Charles was advised by his councillors to issue a <a href="mandamus">mandamus</a> condemning this practice and allowing them to return. Fox was able to meet some of the New England Friends when they came to London, stimulating his interest in the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">colonies</a>. Fox was unable to travel there immediately: he was imprisoned again in 1664 for his refusal to swear the oath of allegiance, and on his release in 1666 was preoccupied with organizational matters—he normalized the system of monthly and quarterly meetings throughout the country, and extended it to Ireland.

Visiting Ireland also gave him the opportunity to preach against what he saw as the excesses of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, in particular the use of ritual. More recent Quaker commentators have noted points of contact between the denominations: both claim the actual presence of God in their meetings, and both allow the collective opinion of the church to augment Biblical teaching. Fox, however, did not perceive this, brought up as he was in a wholly <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> environment hostile to "Popery".

Fox married <a href="Margaret%20Fell">Margaret Fell</a> of <a href="Swarthmoor%20Hall">Swarthmoor Hall</a>, a lady of high social position and one of his early converts, on 27 October 1669 at a meeting in Bristol. She was ten years his senior and had eight children (all but one of them Quakers) by her first husband, Thomas Fell, who had died in 1658. She was herself very active in the movement, and had campaigned for equality and the acceptance of women as preachers. As there were no priests at Quaker weddings to perform the ceremony, the union took the form of a civil marriage approved by the principals and the witnesses at a meeting. Ten days after the marriage, Margaret returned to Swarthmoor to continue her work there while George went back to London. Their shared religious work was at the heart of their life together, and they later collaborated on a great deal of the administration the Society required. Shortly after the marriage, Margaret was imprisoned at Lancaster; George remained in the south-east of England, becoming so ill and depressed that for a time he lost his sight.

By 1671 Fox had recovered and Margaret had been released by order of the King. Fox resolved to visit the English settlements in America and the West Indies, remaining there for two years, possibly to counter any remnants of Perrot's teaching there. After a voyage of seven weeks, during which dolphins were caught and eaten, the party arrived in <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a> on 3 October 1671. From there, Fox sent an <a href="Epistle%20%28Quaker%29">epistle</a> to Friends spelling out the role of women's meetings in the Quaker marriage ceremony, a point of controversy when he returned home. One of his proposals suggested that the prospective couple should be interviewed by an all-female meeting prior to the marriage to determine whether there were any financial or other impediments. Though women's meetings had been held in London for the last ten years, this was an innovation in Bristol and the north-west of England, which many there felt went too far.

Fox wrote a letter to the governor and assembly of the island in which he refuted charges that Quakers were stirring up the slaves to revolt and tried to affirm the orthodoxy of Quaker beliefs. After a stay in <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, Fox's first landfall on the <a href="North%20America">North American continent</a> was at <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, where he participated in a four-day meeting of local Quakers. He remained there while various of his English companions travelled to the other colonies, because he wished to meet some <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> who were interested in Quaker ways—though he relates that they had "a great dispute" among themselves about whether to participate in the meeting. Fox was impressed by their general demeanour, which he said was "courteous and loving". He resented the suggestion (from a man in <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>) that "the Light and Spirit of God ... was not in the Indians", a proposition which Fox refuted. Fox left no record of encountering slaves on the mainland.

Elsewhere in the colonies, Fox helped to establish organizational systems for the Friends, along the same lines as he had done in Britain. He also preached to many non-Quakers, some but not all of whom were converted.

Following extensive travels around the various American colonies, George Fox returned to England in June 1673 confident that his movement was firmly established there. Back in England, however, he found his movement sharply divided among provincial Friends (such as William Rogers, John Wilkinson and John Story) who resisted establishment of women's meetings and the power of those who resided in or near London. With <a href="William%20Penn">William Penn</a> and <a href="Robert%20Barclay">Robert Barclay</a> as allies of Fox, the challenge to Fox's leadership was eventually put down. But in the midst of the dispute, Fox was imprisoned again for refusing to swear oaths after being captured at <a href="Armscote">Armscote</a>, <a href="Worcestershire">Worcestershire</a>. His mother died shortly after hearing of his arrest and Fox's health began to suffer. Margaret Fell petitioned the king for his release, which was granted, but Fox felt too weak to take up his travels immediately. Recuperating at Swarthmoor, he began dictating what would be published after his death as his journal and devoted his time to his written output: letters, both public and private, as well as books and essays. Much of his energy was devoted to the topic of oaths, having become convinced of its importance to Quaker ideas. By refusing to swear, he felt that he could bear witness to the value of truth in everyday life, as well as to God, whom he associated with truth and the <a href="inner%20light">inner light</a>.

For three months in 1677 and a month in 1684, Fox visited the Friends in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, and organized their meetings for discipline. The first trip was the more extensive, taking him into what is now Germany, proceeding along the coast to <a href="Friedrichstadt">Friedrichstadt</a> and back again over several days. Meanwhile, Fox was participating in a dispute among Friends in Britain over the role of women in meetings, a struggle which took much of his energy and left him exhausted. Returning to England, he stayed in the south in order to try to end the dispute. He followed the foundation of the colony of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, where Penn had given him over of land, with interest. Persecution continued, with Fox arrested briefly in October 1683. Fox's health was becoming worse, but he continued his activities—writing to leaders in <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Poland</a>, <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, and elsewhere about his beliefs, and their treatment of Quakers.

In the last years of his life, Fox continued to participate in the London Meetings, and still made representations to Parliament about the sufferings of Friends. The new King, <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a>, pardoned religious dissenters jailed for failure to attend the established church, leading to the release of about 1,500 Friends. Though the Quakers lost influence after the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>, which deposed James II, the <a href="Act%20of%20Toleration%201689">Act of Toleration 1689</a> put an end to the uniformity laws under which Quakers had been persecuted, permitting them to assemble freely.

Two days after preaching, as usual, at the <a href="Gracechurch%20Street">Gracechurch Street</a> Meeting House in London, George Fox died between 9 and 10 p.m. on 13 January 1691. He was interred in the <a href="Quaker%20Gardens%2C%20Islington">Quaker Burying Ground</a>, Bunhill Fields, three days later in the presence of thousands of mourners.

Fox's journal was first published in 1694, after editing by <a href="Thomas%20Ellwood">Thomas Ellwood</a>—a friend and associate of <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a>—with a preface by <a href="William%20Penn">William Penn</a>. Like most similar works of its time the journal was not written contemporaneously to the events it describes, but rather compiled many years later, much of it dictated. Parts of the journal were not in fact by Fox at all but are constructed by its editors from diverse sources and written as if by him. The dissent within the movement and the contributions of others to the development of Quakerism are largely excluded from the narrative. Fox portrays himself as always in the right and always vindicated by God's interventions on his behalf. As a religious autobiography, <a href="Rufus%20Jones%20%28writer%29">Rufus Jones</a> compared it to such works as <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine's</a> "<a href="Confessions%20%28St.%20Augustine%29">Confessions</a>" and <a href="John%20Bunyan">John Bunyan</a>'s "<a href="Grace%20Abounding%20to%20the%20Chief%20of%20Sinners">Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners</a>". It is, though, an intensely personal work with little dramatic power that only succeeds in appealing to readers after substantial editing. Historians have used it as a primary source because of its wealth of detail on ordinary life in the 17th century, and the many towns and villages which Fox visited.

Hundreds of Fox's letters—mostly intended for wide circulation, along with a few private communications—were also published. Written from the 1650s onwards, with such titles as "Friends, seek the peace of all men" or "To Friends, to know one another in the light", they give enormous insight into the detail of Fox's beliefs, and show his determination to spread them. These writings, in the words of <a href="Henry%20Cadbury">Henry Cadbury</a>, Professor of Divinity at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> and a leading Quaker, "contain a few fresh phrases of his own, [but] are generally characterized by an excess of scriptural language and today they seem dull and repetitious". Others point out that "Fox's sermons, rich in biblical metaphor and common speech, brought hope in a dark time." Fox's aphorisms have found an audience beyond Quakers, with many other church groups using them to illustrate principles of Christianity.

Fox is described by Ellwood as "graceful in countenance, manly in personage, grave in gesture, courteous in conversation". Penn says he was "civil beyond all forms of breeding". We are told that he was "plain and powerful in preaching, fervent in prayer", "a discerner of other men's spirits, and very much master of his own", skilful to "speak a word in due season to the conditions and capacities of most, especially to them that were weary, and wanted soul's rest"; "valiant in asserting the truth, bold in defending it, patient in suffering for it, immovable as a rock".

Fox's influence on the Society of Friends was tremendous, and his beliefs have largely been carried forward by that group. Perhaps his most significant achievement, other than his predominant influence in the early movement, was his leadership in overcoming the twin challenges of government prosecution after the Restoration and internal disputes that threatened its stability during the same period. Not all of his beliefs were welcome to all Quakers: his Puritan-like opposition to the arts and rejection of <a href="theology">theological</a> study, forestalled development of these practices among Quakers for some time.

The name of George Fox is often invoked by traditionalist Friends who dislike modern liberal attitudes to the Society's Christian origins. At the same time, Quakers and others can relate to Fox's religious experience, and even those who disagree with many of his ideas regard him as a pioneer.

<a href="Walt%20Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>, who was raised by parents inspired by Quaker principles, later wrote: "George Fox stands for something too—a thought—the thought that wakes in silent hours—perhaps the deepest, most eternal thought latent in the human soul. This is the thought of God, merged in the thoughts of moral right and the immortality of identity. Great, great is this thought—aye, greater than all else."

Hydrogen is a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol H and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 1. With a <a href="standard%20atomic%20weight">standard atomic weight</a> of , hydrogen is the lightest element in the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>. Its <a href="monatomic">monatomic</a> form (H) is the <a href="abundance%20of%20the%20chemical%20elements">most abundant</a> chemical substance in the <a href="Universe">Universe</a>, constituting roughly 75% of all <a href="baryon">baryon</a>ic mass. Non-<a href="stellar%20remnant">remnant</a> <a href="star">star</a>s are mainly composed of hydrogen in the <a href="plasma%20state">plasma state</a>. The most common <a href="isotope">isotope</a> of hydrogen, termed "protium" (name rarely used, symbol H), has one <a href="proton">proton</a> and no <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s.

The universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the <a href="Recombination%20%28cosmology%29">recombination epoch</a>. At <a href="standard%20temperature%20and%20pressure">standard temperature and pressure</a>, hydrogen is a <a href="Transparency%20%28optics%29">colorless</a>, <a href="odorless">odorless</a>, <a href="taste">taste</a>less, non-toxic, <a href="nonmetal">nonmetal</a>lic, highly <a href="combustion">combustible</a> <a href="Diatomic%20molecule">diatomic</a> <a href="gas">gas</a> with the <a href="molecular%20formula">molecular formula</a> H. Since hydrogen readily forms <a href="covalent%20bond">covalent</a> compounds with most nonmetallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in <a href="Molecular%20geometry">molecular forms</a> such as <a href="water">water</a> or <a href="organic%20compound">organic compound</a>s. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in <a href="acid%E2%80%93base%20reaction">acid–base reaction</a>s because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In <a href="ionic%20compound">ionic compound</a>s, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., <a href="anion">anion</a>) when it is known as a <a href="hydride">hydride</a>, or as a positively charged (i.e., <a href="cation">cation</a>) <a href="chemical%20species">species</a> denoted by the symbol H. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex. As the only neutral atom for which the <a href="Schr%C3%B6dinger%20equation">Schrödinger equation</a> can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>.

Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids on metals. In 1766–81, <a href="Henry%20Cavendish">Henry Cavendish</a> was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance, and that it produces water when burned, the property for which it was later named: in Greek, hydrogen means "water-former".

<a href="Hydrogen%20production">Industrial production</a> is mainly from steam reforming natural gas, and less often from more energy-intensive methods such as the <a href="electrolysis%20of%20water">electrolysis of water</a>. Most hydrogen is used near the site of its production, the two largest uses being <a href="fossil%20fuel">fossil fuel</a> processing (e.g., <a href="hydrocracking">hydrocracking</a>) and <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> production, mostly for the fertilizer market. Hydrogen is a concern in <a href="metallurgy">metallurgy</a> as it can <a href="hydrogen%20embrittlement">embrittle</a> many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.

Hydrogen gas (dihydrogen or molecular hydrogen, also called diprotium when consisting specifically of a pair of <a href="Hydrogen-1">protium</a> atoms) is highly flammable and will burn in air at a very wide range of concentrations between 4% and 75% by volume. The <a href="enthalpy%20of%20combustion">enthalpy of combustion</a> is −286 kJ/mol:

Hydrogen gas forms explosive mixtures with air in concentrations from 4–74% and with chlorine at 5–95%. The explosive reactions may be triggered by spark, heat, or sunlight. The hydrogen <a href="autoignition%20temperature">autoignition temperature</a>, the temperature of spontaneous ignition in air, is . Pure <a href="Oxyhydrogen">hydrogen-oxygen</a> flames emit <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light and with high oxygen mix are nearly invisible to the naked eye, as illustrated by the faint plume of the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Main%20Engine">Space Shuttle Main Engine</a>, compared to the highly visible plume of a <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Solid%20Rocket%20Booster">Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster</a>, which uses an <a href="Ammonium%20perchlorate%20composite%20propellant">ammonium perchlorate composite</a>. The detection of a burning hydrogen leak may require a <a href="flame%20detector">flame detector</a>; such leaks can be very dangerous. Hydrogen flames in other conditions are blue, resembling blue natural gas flames.

The <a href="Hindenburg%20disaster">destruction of the Hindenburg airship</a> was a notorious example of hydrogen combustion and the cause is still debated. The visible orange flames in that incident were the result of a rich mixture of hydrogen to oxygen combined with carbon compounds from the airship skin.

H reacts with every oxidizing element. Hydrogen can react spontaneously and violently at room temperature with <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a> and <a href="fluorine">fluorine</a> to form the corresponding hydrogen halides, <a href="hydrogen%20chloride">hydrogen chloride</a> and <a href="hydrogen%20fluoride">hydrogen fluoride</a>, which are also potentially dangerous <a href="acid">acid</a>s.

The <a href="ground%20state">ground state</a> <a href="energy%20level">energy level</a> of the electron in a hydrogen atom is −13.6 <a href="Electronvolt">eV</a>, which is equivalent to an ultraviolet <a href="photon">photon</a> of roughly 91 <a href="metre">nm</a> wavelength.

The energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using the <a href="Bohr%20model">Bohr model</a> of the atom, which conceptualizes the electron as "orbiting" the proton in analogy to the Earth's orbit of the Sun. However, the atomic electron and proton are held together by <a href="electromagnetic%20force">electromagnetic force</a>, while planets and celestial objects are held by <a href="gravity">gravity</a>. Because of the discretization of <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momentum</a> postulated in early <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> by Bohr, the electron in the Bohr model can only occupy certain allowed distances from the proton, and therefore only certain allowed energies.

A more accurate description of the hydrogen atom comes from a purely quantum mechanical treatment that uses the <a href="Schr%C3%B6dinger%20equation">Schrödinger equation</a>, <a href="Dirac%20equation">Dirac equation</a> or even the <a href="Richard%20Feynman">Feynman</a> <a href="path%20integral%20formulation">path integral formulation</a> to calculate the <a href="probability%20amplitude">probability density</a> of the electron around the proton. The most complicated treatments allow for the small effects of <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a> and <a href="vacuum%20polarization">vacuum polarization</a>. In the quantum mechanical treatment, the electron in a ground state hydrogen atom has no angular momentum at all—illustrating how the "planetary orbit" differs from electron motion.
There exist two different <a href="spin%20isomers%20of%20hydrogen">spin isomers of hydrogen</a> diatomic molecules that differ by the relative <a href="spin%20%28physics%29">spin</a> of their nuclei. In the <a href="orthohydrogen">orthohydrogen</a> form, the spins of the two protons are parallel and form a triplet state with a molecular spin quantum number of 1 (+); in the <a href="parahydrogen">parahydrogen</a> form the spins are antiparallel and form a singlet with a molecular spin quantum number of 0 (–). At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen gas contains about 25% of the para form and 75% of the ortho form, also known as the "normal form". The equilibrium ratio of orthohydrogen to parahydrogen depends on temperature, but because the ortho form is an <a href="excited%20state">excited state</a> and has a higher energy than the para form, it is unstable and cannot be purified. At very low temperatures, the equilibrium state is composed almost exclusively of the para form. The liquid and gas phase thermal properties of pure parahydrogen differ significantly from those of the normal form because of differences in rotational heat capacities, as discussed more fully in "<a href="spin%20isomers%20of%20hydrogen">spin isomers of hydrogen</a>". The ortho/para distinction also occurs in other hydrogen-containing molecules or functional groups, such as water and <a href="methylene%20group">methylene</a>, but is of little significance for their thermal properties.

The uncatalyzed interconversion between para and ortho H increases with increasing temperature; thus rapidly condensed H contains large quantities of the high-energy ortho form that converts to the para form very slowly. The ortho/para ratio in condensed H is an important consideration in the preparation and storage of <a href="liquid%20hydrogen">liquid hydrogen</a>: the conversion from ortho to para is <a href="exothermic">exothermic</a> and produces enough heat to evaporate some of the hydrogen liquid, leading to loss of liquefied material. <a href="Catalyst">Catalyst</a>s for the ortho-para interconversion, such as <a href="ferric%20oxide">ferric oxide</a>, <a href="activated%20carbon">activated carbon</a>, platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds, <a href="chromic%20oxide">chromic oxide</a>, or some nickel compounds, are used during hydrogen cooling.


While H is not very reactive under standard conditions, it does form compounds with most elements. Hydrogen can form compounds with elements that are more <a href="electronegative">electronegative</a>, such as <a href="halogen">halogen</a>s (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I), or <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>; in these compounds hydrogen takes on a partial positive charge. When bonded to <a href="fluorine">fluorine</a>, <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, or <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, hydrogen can participate in a form of medium-strength noncovalent bonding with the hydrogen of other similar molecules, a phenomenon called <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>ing that is critical to the stability of many biological molecules. Hydrogen also forms compounds with less electronegative elements, such as <a href="metal">metal</a>s and <a href="metalloid">metalloid</a>s, where it takes on a partial negative charge. These compounds are often known as <a href="hydride">hydride</a>s.

Hydrogen forms a vast array of compounds with <a href="carbon">carbon</a> called the <a href="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a>s, and an even vaster array with <a href="heteroatoms">heteroatoms</a> that, because of their general association with living things, are called <a href="organic%20compound">organic compound</a>s. The study of their properties is known as <a href="organic%20chemistry">organic chemistry</a> and their study in the context of living <a href="organism">organism</a>s is known as <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a>. By some definitions, "organic" compounds are only required to contain carbon. However, most of them also contain hydrogen, and because it is the carbon-hydrogen bond which gives this class of compounds most of its particular chemical characteristics, carbon-hydrogen bonds are required in some definitions of the word "organic" in chemistry. Millions of <a href="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a>s are known, and they are usually formed by complicated synthetic pathways that seldom involve elemental hydrogen.

Compounds of hydrogen are often called <a href="hydride">hydride</a>s, a term that is used fairly loosely. The term "hydride" suggests that the H atom has acquired a negative or anionic character, denoted H, and is used when hydrogen forms a compound with a more <a href="electropositive">electropositive</a> element. The existence of the <a href="hydride">hydride anion</a>, suggested by <a href="Gilbert%20N.%20Lewis">Gilbert N. Lewis</a> in 1916 for group 1 and 2 salt-like hydrides, was demonstrated by Moers in 1920 by the electrolysis of molten <a href="lithium%20hydride">lithium hydride</a> (LiH), producing a <a href="Stoichiometry">stoichiometric</a> quantity of hydrogen at the anode. For hydrides other than group 1 and 2 metals, the term is quite misleading, considering the low electronegativity of hydrogen. An exception in group 2 hydrides is , which is polymeric. In <a href="lithium%20aluminium%20hydride">lithium aluminium hydride</a>, the anion carries hydridic centers firmly attached to the Al(III).

Although hydrides can be formed with almost all main-group elements, the number and combination of possible compounds varies widely; for example, more than 100 binary borane hydrides are known, but only one binary aluminium hydride. Binary <a href="indium">indium</a> hydride has not yet been identified, although larger complexes exist.

In <a href="inorganic%20chemistry">inorganic chemistry</a>, hydrides can also serve as <a href="bridging%20ligand">bridging ligand</a>s that link two metal centers in a <a href="coordination%20complex">coordination complex</a>. This function is particularly common in <a href="group%2013%20element">group 13 element</a>s, especially in <a href="borane">borane</a>s (<a href="boron">boron</a> hydrides) and <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a> complexes, as well as in clustered <a href="carborane">carborane</a>s.

Oxidation of hydrogen removes its electron and gives <a href="Hydrogen%20ion">H</a>, which contains no electrons and a <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nucleus</a> which is usually composed of one proton. That is why is often called a proton. This species is central to discussion of <a href="acid">acid</a>s. Under the <a href="Br%C3%B8nsted%E2%80%93Lowry%20acid%E2%80%93base%20theory">Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory</a>, acids are proton donors, while bases are proton acceptors.

A bare proton, , cannot exist in solution or in ionic crystals because of its unstoppable attraction to other atoms or molecules with electrons. Except at the high temperatures associated with plasmas, such protons cannot be removed from the <a href="electron%20cloud">electron cloud</a>s of atoms and molecules, and will remain attached to them. However, the term 'proton' is sometimes used loosely and metaphorically to refer to positively charged or <a href="cation">cation</a>ic hydrogen attached to other species in this fashion, and as such is denoted "" without any implication that any single protons exist freely as a species.

To avoid the implication of the naked "solvated proton" in solution, acidic aqueous solutions are sometimes considered to contain a less unlikely fictitious species, termed the "<a href="hydronium">hydronium</a> ion" (). However, even in this case, such solvated hydrogen cations are more realistically conceived as being organized into clusters that form species closer to H. Other <a href="oxonium%20ion">oxonium ion</a>s are found when water is in acidic solution with other solvents.

Although exotic on Earth, one of the most common ions in the universe is the ion, known as <a href="Trihydrogen%20cation">protonated molecular hydrogen</a> or the trihydrogen cation.

<a href="NASA">NASA</a> has investigated the use of atomic hydrogen as a <a href="rocket%20propellant">rocket propellant</a>. It could be stored in liquid helium to prevent it from recombining into molecular hydrogen. When the helium is vaporized, the atomic hydrogen would be released and combine back to molecular hydrogen. The result would be an intensely hot stream of hydrogen and helium gas. The liftoff weight of rockets could be reduced by 50% by this method.

Most <a href="Interstellar%20space">interstellar</a> hydrogen is in the form of atomic hydrogen because the atoms can seldom collide and combine. They are the source of the important 21 cm <a href="hydrogen%20line">hydrogen line</a> in <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a> at 1420 MHz.

Hydrogen has three naturally occurring isotopes, denoted , and . Other, highly unstable nuclei ( to ) have been synthesized in the laboratory but not observed in nature.

Hydrogen is the only element that has different names for its isotopes in common use today. During the early study of radioactivity, various heavy radioactive isotopes were given their own names, but such names are no longer used, except for deuterium and tritium. The symbols D and T (instead of and ) are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium, but the corresponding symbol for protium, P, is already in use for <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a> and thus is not available for protium. In its <a href="IUPAC%20nomenclature">nomenclatural</a> guidelines, the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry</a> (IUPAC) allows any of D, T, , and to be used, although and are preferred.

The <a href="exotic%20atom">exotic atom</a> <a href="muonium">muonium</a> (symbol Mu), composed of an <a href="muon">antimuon</a> and an <a href="electron">electron</a>, is also sometimes considered as a light radioisotope of hydrogen, due to the mass difference between the antimuon and the electron. Muonium was discovered in 1960. During the muon's lifetime, muonium can enter into compounds such as muonium chloride (MuCl) or sodium muonide (NaMu), analogous to <a href="hydrogen%20chloride">hydrogen chloride</a> and <a href="sodium%20hydride">sodium hydride</a> respectively.

In 1671, <a href="Robert%20Boyle">Robert Boyle</a> discovered and described the reaction between <a href="iron">iron</a> filings and dilute <a href="acid">acid</a>s, which results in the production of hydrogen gas. In 1766, <a href="Henry%20Cavendish">Henry Cavendish</a> was the first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance, by naming the gas from a <a href="metal-acid%20reaction">metal-acid reaction</a> "inflammable air". He speculated that "inflammable air" was in fact identical to the hypothetical substance called "<a href="Phlogiston%20theory">phlogiston</a>" and further finding in 1781 that the gas produces water when burned. He is usually given credit for the discovery of hydrogen as an element. In 1783, <a href="Antoine%20Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a> gave the element the name hydrogen (from the Greek ὑδρο- "hydro" meaning "water" and -γενής "genes" meaning "creator") when he and <a href="Pierre-Simon%20Laplace">Laplace</a> reproduced Cavendish's finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned.

Lavoisier produced hydrogen for his experiments on mass conservation by reacting a flux of steam with metallic <a href="iron">iron</a> through an incandescent iron tube heated in a fire. Anaerobic oxidation of iron by the protons of water at high temperature can be schematically represented by the set of following reactions:

Many metals such as <a href="zirconium">zirconium</a> undergo a similar reaction with water leading to the production of hydrogen.

Hydrogen was <a href="Liquid%20hydrogen">liquefied</a> for the first time by <a href="James%20Dewar">James Dewar</a> in 1898 by using <a href="regenerative%20cooling">regenerative cooling</a> and his invention, the <a href="vacuum%20flask">vacuum flask</a>. He produced <a href="solid%20hydrogen">solid hydrogen</a> the next year. <a href="Deuterium">Deuterium</a> was discovered in December 1931 by <a href="Harold%20Urey">Harold Urey</a>, and <a href="tritium">tritium</a> was prepared in 1934 by <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a>, <a href="Mark%20Oliphant">Mark Oliphant</a>, and <a href="Paul%20Harteck">Paul Harteck</a>. <a href="Heavy%20water">Heavy water</a>, which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932. <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Isaac%20de%20Rivaz">François Isaac de Rivaz</a> built the first <a href="de%20Rivaz%20engine">de Rivaz engine</a>, an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806. <a href="Edward%20Daniel%20Clarke">Edward Daniel Clarke</a> invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819. The <a href="D%C3%B6bereiner%27s%20lamp">Döbereiner's lamp</a> and <a href="limelight">limelight</a> were invented in 1823.

The first hydrogen-filled <a href="balloon">balloon</a> was invented by <a href="Jacques%20Charles">Jacques Charles</a> in 1783. Hydrogen provided the lift for the first reliable form of air-travel following the 1852 invention of the first hydrogen-lifted airship by <a href="Henri%20Giffard">Henri Giffard</a>. German count <a href="Ferdinand%20von%20Zeppelin">Ferdinand von Zeppelin</a> promoted the idea of rigid airships lifted by hydrogen that later were called <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a>s; the first of which had its maiden flight in 1900. Regularly scheduled flights started in 1910 and by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, they had carried 35,000 passengers without a serious incident. Hydrogen-lifted airships were used as observation platforms and bombers during the war.

The first non-stop transatlantic crossing was made by the British airship "<a href="R34%20%28airship%29">R34</a>" in 1919. Regular passenger service resumed in the 1920s and the discovery of <a href="helium">helium</a> reserves in the United States promised increased safety, but the U.S. government refused to sell the gas for this purpose. Therefore, H was used in the <a href="LZ%20129%20Hindenburg">"Hindenburg"</a> airship, which was destroyed in a midair fire over <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> on 6 May 1937. The incident was broadcast live on radio and filmed. Ignition of leaking hydrogen is widely assumed to be the cause, but later investigations pointed to the ignition of the <a href="aluminium">aluminized</a> fabric coating by <a href="static%20electricity">static electricity</a>. But the damage to hydrogen's reputation as a <a href="lifting%20gas">lifting gas</a> was already done and commercial hydrogen airship travel <a href="Rigid%20airship%23Demise">ceased</a>. Hydrogen is still used, in preference to non-flammable but more expensive helium, as a lifting gas for <a href="Weather%20balloon%23Materials%20and%20equipment">weather balloons</a>.

In the same year the first <a href="hydrogen-cooled%20turbogenerator">hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator</a> went into service with gaseous hydrogen as a <a href="coolant">coolant</a> in the rotor and the stator in 1937 at <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton</a>, Ohio, by the Dayton Power & Light Co.; because of the thermal conductivity of hydrogen gas, this is the most common type in its field today.

The <a href="nickel%20hydrogen%20battery">nickel hydrogen battery</a> was used for the first time in 1977 aboard the U.S. Navy's Navigation technology satellite-2 (NTS-2). For example, the <a href="International%20Space%20Station">ISS</a>, <a href="2001%20Mars%20Odyssey">Mars Odyssey</a> and the <a href="Mars%20Global%20Surveyor">Mars Global Surveyor</a> are equipped with nickel-hydrogen batteries. In the dark part of its orbit, the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> is also powered by nickel-hydrogen batteries, which were finally replaced in May 2009, more than 19 years after launch and 13 years beyond their design life.

Because of its simple atomic structure, consisting only of a proton and an electron, the <a href="hydrogen%20atom">hydrogen atom</a>, together with the spectrum of light produced from it or absorbed by it, has been central to the development of the theory of <a href="atom">atom</a>ic structure. Furthermore, study of the corresponding simplicity of the hydrogen molecule and the corresponding cation <a href="H2%2B"></a> brought understanding of the nature of the <a href="chemical%20bond">chemical bond</a>, which followed shortly after the quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom had been developed in the mid-1920s.

One of the first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed (but not understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half a century before full <a href="Quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanical theory</a> arrived. Maxwell observed that the <a href="specific%20heat%20capacity">specific heat capacity</a> of H unaccountably departs from that of a <a href="diatomic">diatomic</a> gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H because of its low mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect.

<a href="Antihydrogen">Antihydrogen</a> () is the <a href="antimatter">antimatter</a> counterpart to hydrogen. It consists of an <a href="antiproton">antiproton</a> with a <a href="positron">positron</a>. Antihydrogen is the only type of antimatter atom to have been produced .

Hydrogen, as atomic H, is the most <a href="Natural%20abundance">abundant</a> <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> in the universe, making up 75% of <a href="Baryon">normal matter</a> by <a href="mass">mass</a> and more than 90% by number of atoms. (Most of the mass of the universe, however, is not in the form of chemical-element type matter, but rather is postulated to occur as yet-undetected forms of mass such as <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a> and <a href="dark%20energy">dark energy</a>.) This element is found in great abundance in stars and <a href="gas%20giant">gas giant</a> planets. <a href="Molecular%20cloud">Molecular cloud</a>s of H are associated with <a href="star%20formation">star formation</a>. Hydrogen plays a vital role in powering <a href="star">star</a>s through the <a href="proton-proton%20reaction">proton-proton reaction</a> and the <a href="CNO%20cycle">CNO cycle</a> of <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a>.

Throughout the universe, hydrogen is mostly found in the <a href="atom">atom</a>ic and <a href="Plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma</a> states, with properties quite different from those of molecular hydrogen. As a plasma, hydrogen's electron and proton are not bound together, resulting in very high electrical conductivity and high emissivity (producing the light from the Sun and other stars). The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the <a href="solar%20wind">solar wind</a> they interact with the Earth's <a href="magnetosphere">magnetosphere</a> giving rise to <a href="Birkeland%20current">Birkeland current</a>s and the <a href="Aurora%20%28phenomenon%29">aurora</a>. Hydrogen is found in the neutral atomic state in the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a>. The large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped Lyman-alpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic density of the Universe up to <a href="redshift">redshift</a> "z"=4.

Under ordinary conditions on Earth, elemental hydrogen exists as the diatomic gas, H. However, hydrogen gas is very rare in the Earth's atmosphere (1 <a href="part%20per%20million">ppm</a> by volume) because of its light weight, which enables it to <a href="atmospheric%20escape">escape from Earth's gravity</a> more easily than heavier gases. However, hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the Earth's surface, mostly in the form of <a href="chemical%20compound">chemical compound</a>s such as <a href="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a>s and water. Hydrogen gas is produced by some bacteria and <a href="algae">algae</a> and is a natural component of <a href="flatus">flatus</a>, as is <a href="methane">methane</a>, itself a hydrogen source of increasing importance.

A molecular form called <a href="protonated%20molecular%20hydrogen">protonated molecular hydrogen</a> () is found in the interstellar medium, where it is generated by ionization of molecular hydrogen from <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a>s. This ion has also been observed in the upper atmosphere of the planet <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. The ion is relatively stable in the environment of outer space due to the low temperature and density. is one of the most abundant ions in the Universe, and it plays a notable role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium. Neutral <a href="triatomic%20hydrogen">triatomic hydrogen</a> H can exist only in an excited form and is unstable. By contrast, the positive <a href="hydrogen%20molecular%20ion">hydrogen molecular ion</a> () is a rare molecule in the universe.

 is produced in chemistry and biology laboratories, often as a by-product of other reactions; in industry for the <a href="hydrogenation">hydrogenation</a> of <a href="Saturation%20%28chemistry%29">unsaturated</a> substrates; and in nature as a means of expelling <a href="redox">reducing</a> equivalents in biochemical reactions.

The <a href="electrolysis%20of%20water">electrolysis of water</a> is a simple method of producing hydrogen. A low voltage current is run through the water, and gaseous oxygen forms at the <a href="anode">anode</a> while gaseous hydrogen forms at the <a href="cathode">cathode</a>. Typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage. If, however, the gas is to be burnt on site, oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion, and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals. (Iron, for instance, would oxidize, and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off.) The theoretical maximum efficiency (electricity used vs. energetic value of hydrogen produced) is in the range 88–94%.

When determining the electrical efficiency of PEM (proton exchange membrane) electrolysis, the higher heat value (HHV) is used. This is because the catalyst layer interacts with water as steam. As the process operates at 80 °C for PEM electrolysers the waste heat can be redirected through the system to create the steam, resulting in a higher overall electrical efficiency. The lower heat value (LHV) must be used for alkaline electrolysers as the process within these electrolysers requires water in liquid form and uses alkalinity to facilitate the breaking of the bond holding the hydrogen and oxygen atoms together. The lower heat value must also be used for fuel cells, as steam is the output rather than input.

Hydrogen is often produced using natural gas, which involves the removal of hydrogen from hydrocarbons at very high temperatures, with about 95% of hydrogen production coming from steam reforming around year 2000. Commercial bulk hydrogen is usually produced by the <a href="steam%20reforming">steam reforming</a> of <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a>. At high temperatures (1000–1400 K, 700–1100 °C or 1300–2000 °F), steam (water vapor) reacts with <a href="methane">methane</a> to yield <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> and .

This reaction is favored at low pressures but is nonetheless conducted at high pressures (2.0  MPa, 20 atm or 600 <a href="inHg">inHg</a>). This is because high-pressure is the most marketable product and <a href="pressure%20swing%20adsorption">pressure swing adsorption</a> (PSA) purification systems work better at higher pressures. The product mixture is known as "<a href="synthesis%20gas">synthesis gas</a>" because it is often used directly for the production of <a href="methanol">methanol</a> and related compounds. <a href="Hydrocarbon">Hydrocarbon</a>s other than methane can be used to produce synthesis gas with varying product ratios. One of the many complications to this highly optimized technology is the formation of coke or carbon:

Consequently, steam reforming typically employs an excess of . Additional hydrogen can be recovered from the steam by use of carbon monoxide through the <a href="water%20gas%20shift%20reaction">water gas shift reaction</a>, especially with an <a href="iron%20oxide">iron oxide</a> catalyst. This reaction is also a common industrial source of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>:

Other important methods for production include partial oxidation of hydrocarbons:

and the coal reaction, which can serve as a prelude to the shift reaction above:

Hydrogen is sometimes produced and consumed in the same industrial process, without being separated. In the <a href="Haber%20process">Haber process</a> for the <a href="Ammonia%20production">production of ammonia</a>, hydrogen is generated from natural gas. <a href="Electrolysis">Electrolysis</a> of <a href="brine">brine</a> to yield <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a> also produces hydrogen as a co-product.

In the <a href="laboratory">laboratory</a>, is usually prepared by the reaction of dilute <a href="oxidizing%20acid">non-oxidizing acids</a> on some reactive metals such as <a href="zinc">zinc</a> with <a href="Kipp%27s%20apparatus">Kipp's apparatus</a>.

<a href="Aluminium">Aluminium</a> can also produce upon treatment with bases:

An alloy of aluminium and <a href="gallium">gallium</a> in pellet form added to water can be used to generate hydrogen. The process also produces <a href="alumina">alumina</a>, but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and does not need to be transported.

There are more than 200 thermochemical cycles which can be used for <a href="water%20splitting">water splitting</a>, around a dozen of these cycles such as the <a href="iron%20oxide%20cycle">iron oxide cycle</a>, <a href="cerium%28IV%29%20oxide%E2%80%93cerium%28III%29%20oxide%20cycle">cerium(IV) oxide–cerium(III) oxide cycle</a>, <a href="zinc%20zinc-oxide%20cycle">zinc zinc-oxide cycle</a>, <a href="sulfur-iodine%20cycle">sulfur-iodine cycle</a>, <a href="copper-chlorine%20cycle">copper-chlorine cycle</a> and <a href="hybrid%20sulfur%20cycle">hybrid sulfur cycle</a> are under research and in testing phase to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water and heat without using electricity. A number of laboratories (including in France, Germany, Greece, Japan, and the USA) are developing thermochemical methods to produce hydrogen from solar energy and water.

Under anaerobic conditions, <a href="iron">iron</a> and <a href="steel%20alloy">steel alloy</a>s are slowly oxidized by the protons of water concomitantly reduced in molecular hydrogen (). The <a href="anaerobic%20corrosion">anaerobic corrosion</a> of iron leads first to the formation of <a href="ferrous%20hydroxide">ferrous hydroxide</a> (green rust) and can be described by the following reaction:

In its turn, under anaerobic conditions, the <a href="ferrous%20hydroxide">ferrous hydroxide</a> () can be oxidized by the protons of water to form <a href="magnetite">magnetite</a> and molecular hydrogen.
This process is described by the <a href="Schikorr%20reaction">Schikorr reaction</a>:

The well crystallized magnetite () is thermodynamically more stable than the ferrous hydroxide ().

This process occurs during the anaerobic corrosion of <a href="iron">iron</a> and <a href="steel">steel</a> in <a href="Anoxic%20waters">oxygen-free</a> <a href="groundwater">groundwater</a> and in reducing <a href="soil">soil</a>s below the <a href="water%20table">water table</a>.

In the absence of atmospheric oxygen (), in deep geological conditions prevailing far away from Earth atmosphere, hydrogen () is produced during the process of <a href="Serpentinization%23Hydrogen%20production%20by%20anaerobic%20oxidation%20of%20fayalite%20ferrous%20ions">serpentinization</a> by the anaerobic oxidation by water protons (H) of the ferrous (Fe) silicate present in the crystal lattice of <a href="fayalite">fayalite</a> (, the <a href="olivine">olivine</a> iron-endmember). The corresponding reaction leading to the formation of <a href="magnetite">magnetite</a> (), <a href="quartz">quartz</a> (Si) and hydrogen () is the following:

This reaction closely resembles the <a href="Schikorr%20reaction">Schikorr reaction</a> observed in anaerobic oxidation of <a href="ferrous%20hydroxide">ferrous hydroxide</a> in contact with water.

From all the fault gases formed in power <a href="transformer">transformer</a>s, hydrogen is the most common and is generated under most fault conditions; thus, formation of hydrogen is an early indication of serious problems in the transformer's life cycle.

Large quantities of are needed in the petroleum and chemical industries. The largest application of is for the processing ("upgrading") of fossil fuels, and in the production of <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>. The key consumers of in the petrochemical plant include <a href="hydrodealkylation">hydrodealkylation</a>, <a href="hydrodesulfurization">hydrodesulfurization</a>, and <a href="hydrocracking">hydrocracking</a>. has several other important uses. is used as a hydrogenating agent, particularly in increasing the level of saturation of unsaturated fats and <a href="Vegetable%20oil">oils</a> (found in items such as margarine), and in the production of <a href="methanol">methanol</a>. It is similarly the source of hydrogen in the manufacture of <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a>. is also used as a <a href="reducing%20agent">reducing agent</a> of metallic <a href="ore">ore</a>s.

Hydrogen is highly soluble in many <a href="Rare%20earth%20element">rare earth</a> and <a href="transition%20metal">transition metal</a>s and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and <a href="amorphous%20metal">amorphous metal</a>s. Hydrogen <a href="solubility">solubility</a> in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the <a href="crystal%20lattice">crystal lattice</a>. These properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot <a href="palladium">palladium</a> disks, but the gas's high solubility is a metallurgical problem, contributing to the <a href="hydrogen%20embrittlement">embrittlement</a> of many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.

Apart from its use as a reactant, has wide applications in physics and engineering. It is used as a <a href="shielding%20gas">shielding gas</a> in <a href="welding">welding</a> methods such as <a href="atomic%20hydrogen%20welding">atomic hydrogen welding</a>. H is used as the rotor coolant in <a href="electrical%20generator">electrical generator</a>s at <a href="power%20station">power station</a>s, because it has the highest <a href="thermal%20conductivity">thermal conductivity</a> of any gas. Liquid H is used in <a href="cryogenic">cryogenic</a> research, including <a href="superconductivity">superconductivity</a> studies. Because is lighter than air, having a little more than of the density of air, it was once widely used as a <a href="lifting%20gas">lifting gas</a> in balloons and <a href="airship">airship</a>s.

In more recent applications, hydrogen is used pure or mixed with nitrogen (sometimes called <a href="forming%20gas">forming gas</a>) as a <a href="tracer%20gas">tracer gas</a> for minute leak detection. Applications can be found in the automotive, chemical, power generation, aerospace, and telecommunications industries. Hydrogen is an authorized food additive (E 949) that allows food package leak testing among other anti-oxidizing properties.

Hydrogen's rarer isotopes also each have specific applications. <a href="Deuterium">Deuterium</a> (hydrogen-2) is used in <a href="CANDU%20reactor">nuclear fission applications</a> as a <a href="neutron%20moderator">moderator</a> to slow <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s, and in <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a> reactions. Deuterium compounds have applications in chemistry and biology in studies of reaction <a href="Kinetic%20isotope%20effect">isotope effects</a>. <a href="Tritium">Tritium</a> (hydrogen-3), produced in <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>s, is used in the production of <a href="hydrogen%20bomb">hydrogen bomb</a>s, as an isotopic label in the biosciences, and as a <a href="Beta%20radiation">radiation</a> source in luminous paints.

The <a href="triple%20point">triple point</a> temperature of equilibrium hydrogen is a defining fixed point on the <a href="International%20Temperature%20Scale%20of%201990">ITS-90</a> temperature scale at 13.8033 <a href="Kelvin">Kelvin</a>.

Hydrogen is commonly used in power stations as a coolant in generators due to a number of favorable properties that are a direct result of its light diatomic molecules. These include low <a href="density">density</a>, low <a href="viscosity">viscosity</a>, and the highest <a href="Specific%20heat%20capacity">specific heat</a> and <a href="thermal%20conductivity">thermal conductivity</a> of all gases.

Hydrogen is not an energy resource, except in the hypothetical context of commercial <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a> power plants using <a href="deuterium">deuterium</a> or <a href="tritium">tritium</a>, a technology presently far from development. The Sun's energy comes from <a href="Stellar%20nucleosynthesis">nuclear fusion</a> of hydrogen, but this process is difficult to achieve controllably on Earth. Elemental hydrogen from solar, biological, or electrical sources requires more energy to make than is obtained by burning it, so in these cases hydrogen functions as an energy carrier, like a battery. Hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources (such as methane), but these sources are unsustainable.

The <a href="energy%20density">energy density</a> per unit "volume" of both <a href="liquid%20hydrogen">liquid hydrogen</a> and <a href="compressed%20hydrogen">compressed hydrogen</a> gas at any practicable pressure is significantly less than that of traditional fuel sources, although the energy density per unit fuel "mass" is higher. Nevertheless, elemental hydrogen has been widely discussed in the context of energy, as a possible future "carrier" of energy on an economy-wide scale. For example, <a href="CO2%20sequestration">sequestration</a> followed by <a href="carbon%20capture%20and%20storage">carbon capture and storage</a> could be conducted at the point of production from fossil fuels. Hydrogen used in transportation would burn relatively cleanly, with some <a href="NOx">NO</a> emissions, but without carbon emissions. However, the infrastructure costs associated with full conversion to a hydrogen economy would be substantial. <a href="Fuel%20cell">Fuel cell</a>s can convert hydrogen and oxygen directly to electricity more efficiently than internal combustion engines.

Hydrogen is employed to saturate broken ("dangling") bonds of <a href="amorphous%20silicon">amorphous silicon</a> and <a href="amorphous%20carbon">amorphous carbon</a> that helps stabilizing material properties. It is also a potential <a href="electron%20donor">electron donor</a> in various oxide materials, including <a href="zinc%20oxide">ZnO</a>, <a href="Tin%20dioxide">SnO</a>, <a href="Cadmium%20oxide">CdO</a>, <a href="Magnesium%20oxide">MgO</a>, <a href="Zirconium%20dioxide">ZrO</a>, <a href="Hafnium%28IV%29%20oxide">HfO</a>, <a href="Lanthanum%28III%29%20oxide">LaO</a>, <a href="Yttrium%28III%29%20oxide">YO</a>, <a href="Titanium%20dioxide">TiO</a>, <a href="Strontium%20titanate">SrTiO</a>, <a href="Lanthanum%20aluminate">LaAlO</a>, <a href="Silicon%20dioxide">SiO</a>, <a href="Aluminium%20oxide">AlO</a>, <a href="Zircon">ZrSiO</a>, <a href="Hafnon">HfSiO</a>, and <a href="Strontium%20zirconate">SrZrO</a>.

Molecular hydrogen dissolved in water has been marketed as a therapeutic product for a wide variety of illnesses, with early studies showing potential with <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a>, and rheumatoid arthritis.

H is a product of some types of <a href="Fermentation%20%28biochemistry%29">anaerobic metabolism</a> and is produced by several <a href="microorganism">microorganism</a>s, usually via reactions <a href="catalysis">catalyzed</a> by <a href="iron">iron</a>- or <a href="nickel">nickel</a>-containing <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s called <a href="hydrogenase">hydrogenase</a>s. These enzymes catalyze the reversible <a href="redox">redox</a> reaction between H and its component two protons and two electrons. Creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during <a href="pyruvate">pyruvate</a> <a href="fermentation%20%28biochemistry%29">fermentation</a> to water. The natural cycle of hydrogen production and consumption by organisms is called the <a href="hydrogen%20cycle">hydrogen cycle</a>.

<a href="Water%20splitting">Water splitting</a>, in which water is decomposed into its component protons, electrons, and oxygen, occurs in the <a href="Light-dependent%20reactions">light reactions</a> in all <a href="photosynthetic">photosynthetic</a> organisms. Some such organisms, including the alga "<a href="Chlamydomonas%20reinhardtii">Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</a>" and <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a>, have evolved a second step in the <a href="dark%20reaction">dark reaction</a>s in which protons and electrons are reduced to form H gas by specialized hydrogenases in the <a href="chloroplast">chloroplast</a>. Efforts have been undertaken to genetically modify cyanobacterial hydrogenases to efficiently synthesize H gas even in the presence of oxygen. Efforts have also been undertaken with genetically modified <a href="Biological%20hydrogen%20production%20%28Algae%29">alga in a bioreactor</a>.

Hydrogen poses a number of hazards to human safety, from potential <a href="detonation">detonation</a>s and fires when mixed with air to being an <a href="asphyxia">asphyxia</a>nt in its pure, <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>-free form. In addition, liquid hydrogen is a <a href="cryogen">cryogen</a> and presents dangers (such as <a href="frostbite">frostbite</a>) associated with very cold liquids. Hydrogen dissolves in many metals, and, in addition to leaking out, may have adverse effects on them, such as <a href="hydrogen%20embrittlement">hydrogen embrittlement</a>, leading to cracks and explosions. Hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite. Moreover, hydrogen fire, while being extremely hot, is almost invisible, and thus can lead to accidental burns.

Even interpreting the hydrogen data (including safety data) is confounded by a number of phenomena. Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the <a href="Spin%20isomers%20of%20hydrogen">parahydrogen/orthohydrogen</a> ratio (it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the data is usually given). Hydrogen detonation parameters, such as critical detonation pressure and temperature, strongly depend on the container geometry.

Hippocrates

Hippocrates of Kos (; ; ), also known as <a href="Hippocrates%20%28physicians%29">Hippocrates II</a>, was a <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> <a href="physician">physician</a> of the <a href="Age%20of%20Pericles">Age of Pericles</a> (<a href="Classical%20Greece">Classical Greece</a>), who is considered one of the most outstanding figures in the <a href="history%20of%20medicine">history of medicine</a>. He is often referred to as the <a href="List%20of%20persons%20considered%20father%20or%20mother%20of%20a%20scientific%20field%23Medicine%20and%20physiology">"Father of Medicine"</a> in recognition of his lasting contributions to the field as the founder of the Hippocratic School of Medicine. This intellectual school revolutionized <a href="medicine%20in%20ancient%20Greece">medicine in ancient Greece</a>, establishing it as a discipline distinct from other fields with which it had traditionally been associated (<a href="theurgy">theurgy</a> and <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a>), thus establishing medicine as a profession.

However, the achievements of the writers of the <a href="Hippocratic%20Corpus">Corpus</a>, the practitioners of Hippocratic medicine and the actions of Hippocrates himself were often commingled; thus very little is known about what Hippocrates actually thought, wrote, and did. Hippocrates is commonly portrayed as the <a href="wikt%3Aparagon">paragon</a> of the ancient physician, and credited with coining the <a href="Hippocratic%20Oath">Hippocratic Oath</a>, which is still relevant and in use today. He is also credited with greatly advancing the systematic study of <a href="clinical%20medicine">clinical medicine</a>, summing up the medical knowledge of previous schools, and prescribing practices for physicians through the <a href="Hippocratic%20Corpus">Hippocratic Corpus</a> and other works.

Historians agree that Hippocrates was born around the year 460 BC on the Greek island of <a href="Kos">Kos</a>; other biographical information, however, is likely to be untrue.

<a href="Soranus%20of%20Ephesus">Soranus of Ephesus</a>, a 2nd-century Greek <a href="physician">physician</a>, was Hippocrates' first biographer and is the source of most personal information about him. Later biographies are in the "<a href="Suda">Suda</a>" of the 10th century AD, and in the works of <a href="John%20Tzetzes">John Tzetzes</a>, <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s "Politics", which date from the 4th century BC.

Soranus wrote that Hippocrates' father was <a href="Heraclides%20%28physician%29">Heraclides</a>, a physician, and his mother was Praxitela, daughter of Tizane. The two sons of Hippocrates, <a href="Thessalus%20%28physician%29">Thessalus</a> and <a href="Draco%20%28physician%29">Draco</a>, and his son-in-law, <a href="Polybus%20%28physician%29">Polybus</a>, were his students. According to <a href="Galen">Galen</a>, a later physician, Polybus was Hippocrates' true successor, while Thessalus and Draco each had a son named <a href="Hippocrates%20%28physician%29">Hippocrates</a> (Hippocrates III and IV).

Soranus said that Hippocrates learned medicine from his father and grandfather (<a href="Hippocrates%20%28physicians%29">Hippocrates I</a>), and studied other subjects with <a href="Democritus">Democritus</a> and <a href="Gorgias">Gorgias</a>. Hippocrates was probably trained at the <a href="Asclepieion">asklepieion</a> of <a href="Kos">Kos</a>, and took lessons from the <a href="Thrace">Thracian</a> physician <a href="Herodicus">Herodicus of Selymbria</a>. <a href="Plato">Plato</a> mentions Hippocrates in two of his dialogues: in "<a href="Protagoras%20%28dialogue%29">Protagoras</a>", Plato describes Hippocrates as "Hippocrates of Kos, the <a href="Asclepiad%20%28Greek%29">Asclepiad</a>"; while in "<a href="Phaedrus%20%28dialogue%29">Phaedrus</a>", Plato suggests that "Hippocrates the Asclepiad" thought that a complete knowledge of the nature of the body was necessary for medicine. Hippocrates taught and practiced medicine throughout his life, traveling at least as far as <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>, <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, and the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a>. Several different accounts of his death exist. He died, probably in <a href="Larissa">Larissa</a>, at the age of 83, 85 or 90, though some say he lived to be well over 100.

Hippocrates is credited with being the first person to believe that diseases were caused naturally, not because of superstition and gods. Hippocrates was credited by the disciples of <a href="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a> of allying philosophy and medicine. He separated the discipline of medicine from religion, believing and arguing that disease was not a punishment inflicted by the <a href="Greek%20gods">gods</a> but rather the product of environmental factors, diet, and living habits. Indeed there is not a single mention of a mystical illness in the entirety of the Hippocratic Corpus. However, Hippocrates did work with many convictions that were based on what is now known to be incorrect <a href="anatomy">anatomy</a> and <a href="physiology">physiology</a>, such as <a href="Humorism">Humorism</a>.

Ancient Greek schools of medicine were split (into the Knidian and Koan) on how to deal with disease. The <a href="Knidos">Knidian</a> school of medicine focused on diagnosis. Medicine at the time of Hippocrates knew almost nothing of human anatomy and physiology because of the Greek <a href="taboo">taboo</a> forbidding the dissection of humans. The Knidian school consequently failed to distinguish when one disease caused many possible series of symptoms. The Hippocratic school or <a href="Kos">Koan</a> school achieved greater success by applying general <a href="medical%20diagnosis">diagnoses</a> and passive treatments. Its focus was on patient care and <a href="prognosis">prognosis</a>, not <a href="medical%20diagnosis">diagnosis</a>. It could effectively treat diseases and allowed for a great development in clinical practice.

Hippocratic medicine and its philosophy are far removed from that of modern medicine. Now, the physician focuses on specific diagnosis and specialized treatment, both of which were espoused by the Knidian school. This shift in medical thought since Hippocrates' day has caused serious criticism over the past two millennia, with the passivity of Hippocratic treatment being the subject of particularly strong denunciations; for example, the <a href="French%20people">French</a> doctor M. S. Houdart called the Hippocratic treatment a "meditation upon death".

Another important concept in Hippocratic medicine was that of a "crisis", a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on "critical days", which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a "critical day", a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.

Hippocratic medicine was humble and passive. The therapeutic approach was based on "the healing power of nature" (""<a href="vis%20medicatrix%20naturae">vis medicatrix naturae</a>"" in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>). According to this doctrine, the body contains within itself the power to re-balance the <a href="four%20humours">four humours</a> and heal itself ("physis"). Hippocratic therapy focused on simply easing this natural process. To this end, Hippocrates believed "rest and immobilization [were] of capital importance." In general, the Hippocratic medicine was very kind to the patient; treatment was gentle, and emphasized keeping the patient clean and sterile. For example, only clean water or wine were ever used on wounds, though "dry" treatment was preferable. Soothing <a href="Liniment">balms</a> were sometimes employed.

Hippocrates was reluctant to administer drugs and engage in specialized treatment that might prove to be wrongly chosen; generalized therapy followed a generalized diagnosis. Generalized treatments he prescribed include fasting and the consumption of a mix of honey and vinegar. Hippocrates once said that "to eat when you are sick, is to feed your sickness." However, potent drugs were used on certain occasions. This passive approach was very successful in treating relatively simple ailments such as broken bones which required <a href="Traction%20%28orthopedics%29">traction</a> to stretch the skeletal system and relieve pressure on the injured area. The <a href="Hippocratic%20bench">Hippocratic bench</a> and other devices were used to this end.

One of the strengths of Hippocratic medicine was its emphasis on <a href="prognosis">prognosis</a>. At Hippocrates' time, medicinal therapy was quite immature, and often the best thing that physicians could do was to evaluate an illness and predict its likely progression based upon data collected in detailed case histories.

Hippocratic medicine was notable for its strict professionalism, discipline, and rigorous practice. The Hippocratic work "On the Physician" recommends that physicians always be well-kempt, honest, calm, understanding, and serious. The Hippocratic physician paid careful attention to all aspects of his practice: he followed detailed specifications for, "lighting, personnel, instruments, positioning of the patient, and techniques of bandaging and splinting" in the ancient <a href="operating%20room">operating room</a>. He even kept his <a href="fingernail">fingernail</a>s to a precise length.

The Hippocratic School gave importance to the clinical doctrines of observation and documentation. These doctrines dictate that physicians record their findings and their medicinal methods in a very clear and objective manner, so that these records may be passed down and employed by other physicians. Hippocrates made careful, regular note of many symptoms including complexion, pulse, fever, pains, movement, and excretions. He is said to have measured a patient's pulse when taking a case history to discover whether the patient was lying. Hippocrates extended clinical observations into family history and environment. "To him medicine owes the art of clinical inspection and observation." For this reason, he may more properly be termed as the "Father of Medicine".

Hippocrates and his followers were first to describe many diseases and medical conditions. He is given credit for the first description of <a href="Nail%20clubbing">clubbing</a> of the fingers, an important diagnostic sign in chronic lung disease, <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a> and <a href="Cyanotic%20heart%20defect">cyanotic heart disease</a>. For this reason, clubbed fingers are sometimes referred to as "Hippocratic fingers". Hippocrates was also the first physician to describe <a href="Hippocratic%20face">Hippocratic face</a> in "Prognosis". <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> famously alludes to this description when writing of <a href="Falstaff">Falstaff</a>'s death in Act II, Scene iii. of "<a href="Henry%20V%20%28play%29">Henry V</a>".

Hippocrates began to categorize illnesses as <a href="Acute%20%28medicine%29">acute</a>, <a href="Chronic%20%28medicine%29">chronic</a>, <a href="Endemic%20%28epidemiology%29">endemic</a> and <a href="epidemic">epidemic</a>, and use terms such as, "exacerbation, <a href="relapse">relapse</a>, resolution, crisis, <a href="paroxysm">paroxysm</a>, peak, and <a href="convalescence">convalescence</a>." Another of Hippocrates' major contributions may be found in his descriptions of the symptomatology, physical findings, surgical treatment and prognosis of <a href="Empyema">thoracic empyema</a>, i.e. <a href="suppuration">suppuration</a> of the lining of the chest cavity. His teachings remain relevant to present-day students of <a href="Pulmonology">pulmonary medicine</a> and surgery. Hippocrates was the first documented <a href="Cardiothoracic%20Surgery">chest surgeon</a> and his findings and techniques, while crude, such as the use of lead pipes to drain chest wall abscess, are still valid.

The Hippocratic school of medicine described well the ailments of the human <a href="rectum">rectum</a> and the treatment thereof, despite the school's poor theory of medicine. <a href="Hemorrhoids">Hemorrhoids</a>, for instance, though believed to be caused by an excess of bile and phlegm, were treated by Hippocratic physicians in relatively advanced ways. <a href="Cautery">Cautery</a> and <a href="surgery">excision</a> are described in the Hippocratic Corpus, in addition to the preferred methods: <a href="Ligature%20%28medicine%29">ligating</a> the hemorrhoids and drying them with a hot iron. Other treatments such as applying various salves are suggested as well. Today, "treatment [for hemorrhoids] still includes burning, strangling, and excising." Also, some of the fundamental concepts of <a href="proctoscopy">proctoscopy</a> outlined in the Corpus are still in use. For example, the uses of the rectal <a href="speculum%20%28medical%29">speculum</a>, a common medical device, are discussed in the Hippocratic Corpus. This constitutes the earliest recorded reference to <a href="endoscopy">endoscopy</a>. Hippocrates often used lifestyle modifications such as <a href="Diet%20%28nutrition%29">diet</a> and <a href="exercise">exercise</a> to treat diseases such as diabetes, what is today called <a href="lifestyle%20medicine">lifestyle medicine</a>. He is often quoted with "Let food be your medicine, and medicine be your food" and "Walking is man's best medicine", however the quote "Let food be your medicine" appears to be a misquotation and its exact origin remains unknown.

The Hippocratic Corpus (Latin: "Corpus Hippocraticum") is a collection of around seventy early medical works collected in <a href="Alexandrian%20period">Alexandrian Greece</a>. It is written in <a href="Ionic%20dialect">Ionic Greek</a>. The question of whether Hippocrates himself was the author of any of the treatises in the corpus has not been conclusively answered, but current debate revolves around only a few of the treatises seen as potentially by him. Because of the variety of subjects, writing styles and apparent date of construction, the Hippocratic Corpus could not have been written by one person (Ermerins numbers the authors at nineteen). The corpus came to be known by his name because of his fame, possibly all medical works were classified under 'Hippocrates' by a librarian in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. The volumes were probably produced by his students and followers.

The Hippocratic Corpus contains textbooks, lectures, research, notes and philosophical essays on various subjects in medicine, in no particular order. These works were written for different audiences, both specialists and laymen, and were sometimes written from opposing viewpoints; significant contradictions can be found between works in the Corpus. Notable among the treatises of the Corpus are "<a href="Hippocratic%20Oath">The Hippocratic Oath</a>"; "The Book of Prognostics"; "On Regimen in Acute Diseases"; ""; "On Airs, Waters and Places"; "Instruments of Reduction"; "On The Sacred Disease"; etc.

The <a href="Hippocratic%20Oath">Hippocratic Oath</a>, a seminal document on the <a href="ethics">ethics</a> of medical practice, was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity although new information shows it may have been written after his death. This is probably the most famous document of the Hippocratic Corpus. Recently the authenticity of the document's author has come under scrutiny. While the Oath is rarely used in its original form today, it serves as a foundation for other, similar <a href="oath">oath</a>s and laws that define good medical practice and morals. Such derivatives are regularly taken today by medical graduates about to enter medical practice.

Hippocrates is widely considered to be the "Father of Medicine". His contributions revolutionized the practice of medicine; but after his death the advancement stalled. So revered was Hippocrates that his teachings were largely taken as too great to be improved upon and no significant advancements of his methods were made for a long time. The centuries after Hippocrates' death were marked as much by retrograde movement as by further advancement. For instance, "after the Hippocratic period, the practice of taking clinical case-histories died out," according to <a href="Fielding%20H.%20Garrison">Fielding Garrison</a>.

After Hippocrates, the next significant physician was <a href="Galen">Galen</a>, a <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> who lived from AD 129 to AD 200. Galen perpetuated the tradition of Hippocratic medicine, making some advancements, but also some regressions. In the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, the Islamic world adopted Hippocratic methods and developed new medical technologies. After the <a href="European%20Renaissance">European Renaissance</a>, Hippocratic methods were revived in western Europe and even further expanded in the 19th century. Notable among those who employed Hippocrates' rigorous clinical techniques were <a href="Thomas%20Sydenham">Thomas Sydenham</a>, <a href="William%20Heberden">William Heberden</a>, <a href="Jean-Martin%20Charcot">Jean-Martin Charcot</a> and <a href="William%20Osler">William Osler</a>. <a href="Henri%20Huchard">Henri Huchard</a>, a French physician, said that these revivals make up "the whole history of internal medicine."

According to <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s testimony, Hippocrates was known as "The Great Hippocrates". Concerning his disposition, Hippocrates was first portrayed as a "kind, dignified, old country doctor" and later as "stern and forbidding". He is certainly considered wise, of very great intellect and especially as very practical. <a href="Francis%20Adams%20%28translator%29">Francis Adams</a> describes him as "strictly the physician of experience and common sense."

His image as the wise, old doctor is reinforced by busts of him, which wear large beards on a wrinkled face. Many physicians of the time wore their hair in the style of <a href="Jupiter%20%28mythology%29">Jove</a> and <a href="Asklepius">Asklepius</a>. Accordingly, the busts of Hippocrates that have been found could be only altered versions of portraits of these deities. Hippocrates and the beliefs that he embodied are considered medical ideals. <a href="Fielding%20Garrison">Fielding Garrison</a>, an authority on medical history, stated, "He is, above all, the exemplar of that flexible, critical, well-poised attitude of mind, ever on the lookout for sources of error, which is the very essence of the scientific spirit." "His figure... stands for all time as that of the ideal physician," according to "A Short History of Medicine", inspiring the medical profession since his death.

"<a href="The%20Travels%20of%20Sir%20John%20Mandeville">The Travels of Sir John Mandeville</a>" reports (incorrectly) that Hippocrates was the ruler of the islands of "Kos and Lango" [sic], and recounts a legend about Hippocrates' daughter. She was transformed into a hundred-foot long <a href="dragon">dragon</a> by the goddess <a href="Artemis">Diana</a>, and is the "lady of the manor" of an old castle. She emerges three times a year, and will be turned back into a woman if a knight kisses her, making the knight into her consort and ruler of the islands. Various knights try, but flee when they see the hideous dragon; they die soon thereafter. This is a version of the legend of <a href="Melusine">Melusine</a>.

Hippocrates' legendary genealogy traces his paternal heritage directly to Asklepius and his maternal ancestry to <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a>. According to Tzetzes's "<a href="Chiliades">Chiliades</a>", the <a href="ahnentafel">ahnentafel</a> of Hippocrates II is:

1. Hippocrates II. "The Father of Medicine"
2. Heraclides
4. Hippocrates I.
8. Gnosidicus
16.

8192. Hippolochus
16384. <a href="Podalirius">Podalirius</a>
32768. <a href="Asklepius">Asklepius</a>

Some clinical symptoms and signs have been named after Hippocrates as he is believed to be the first person to describe those. <a href="Hippocratic%20face">Hippocratic face</a> is the change produced in the countenance by death, or long sickness, excessive evacuations, excessive hunger, and the like. <a href="Nail%20clubbing">Clubbing</a>, a deformity of the fingers and fingernails, is also known as Hippocratic fingers. <a href="Hippocratic%20succussion">Hippocratic succussion</a> is the internal splashing noise of <a href="hydropneumothorax">hydropneumothorax</a> or <a href="pyopneumothorax">pyopneumothorax</a>. <a href="Hippocratic%20bench">Hippocratic bench</a> (a device which uses tension to aid in setting bones) and <a href="Hippocratic%20cap-shaped%20bandage">Hippocratic cap-shaped bandage</a> are two devices named after Hippocrates. <a href="Hippocratic%20Corpus">Hippocratic Corpus</a> and <a href="Hippocratic%20Oath">Hippocratic Oath</a> are also his namesakes. The drink <a href="hypocras">hypocras</a> is also believed to be invented by Hippocrates. <a href="Risus%20sardonicus">Risus sardonicus</a>, a sustained spasming of the face muscles may also be termed the Hippocratic Smile. The most severe form of hair loss and baldness is called the Hippocratic form.

In the modern age, a lunar crater has been named <a href="Hippocrates%20%28lunar%20crater%29">Hippocrates</a>. The <a href="Hippocratic%20Museum">Hippocratic Museum</a>, a <a href="museum">museum</a> on the Greek island of Kos is dedicated to him. <a href="The%20Hippocrates%20Project">The Hippocrates Project</a> is a program of the <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a> Medical Center to enhance education through use of technology. <a href="Project%20Hippocrates">Project Hippocrates</a> (an acronym of "HIgh PerfOrmance Computing for Robot-AssisTEd Surgery") is an effort of the <a href="Carnegie%20Mellon%20School%20of%20Computer%20Science">Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science</a> and <a href="Shadyside%20Medical%20Center">Shadyside Medical Center</a>, "to develop advanced planning, simulation, and execution technologies for the next generation of computer-assisted surgical robots."

Huldrych Zwingli

Huldrych Zwingli or Ulrich Zwingli (1 January 1484 – 11 October 1531) was a leader of the <a href="Reformation%20in%20Switzerland">Reformation in Switzerland</a>. Born during a time of emerging <a href="Old%20Swiss%20Confederacy">Swiss</a> patriotism and increasing criticism of the <a href="Swiss%20mercenaries">Swiss mercenary system</a>, he attended the <a href="University%20of%20Vienna">University of Vienna</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Basel">University of Basel</a>, a scholarly center of <a href="Renaissance%20humanism">Renaissance humanism</a>. He continued his studies while he served as a pastor in <a href="Glarus">Glarus</a> and later in <a href="Einsiedeln%2C%20Switzerland">Einsiedeln</a>, where he was influenced by the writings of <a href="Erasmus">Erasmus</a>.

In 1519, Zwingli became the pastor of the <a href="Grossm%C3%BCnster">Grossmünster</a> in <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a> where he began to preach ideas on reform of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>. In his first public controversy in 1522, he attacked the <a href="Fasting%20and%20abstinence%20in%20the%20Roman%20Catholic%20Church">custom of fasting</a> during <a href="Lent">Lent</a>. In his publications, he noted corruption in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, promoted clerical marriage, and attacked the use of <a href="Icon">images</a> in places of worship. In 1525, Zwingli introduced a new <a href="Eucharist">communion</a> <a href="liturgy">liturgy</a> to replace the <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a>. Zwingli also clashed with the <a href="Anabaptists">Anabaptists</a>, which resulted in their persecution. Historians have debated whether or not he turned Zürich into a <a href="theocracy">theocracy</a>.

The Reformation spread to other parts of the Swiss Confederation, but several <a href="Cantons%20of%20Switzerland">cantons</a> resisted, preferring to remain <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a>. Zwingli formed an alliance of Reformed cantons which divided the Confederation along religious lines. In 1529, a war between the two sides was averted at the last moment. Meanwhile, Zwingli's ideas came to the attention of <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> and other reformers. They met at the <a href="Marburg%20Colloquy">Marburg Colloquy</a> and although they agreed on many points of doctrine, they could not reach an accord on the doctrine of the <a href="Real%20Presence">Real Presence of Christ</a> in the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>.

In 1531 Zwingli's alliance applied an unsuccessful food blockade on the Catholic cantons. The cantons responded with an attack at a moment when Zürich was ill-prepared. Zwingli died on the battlefield. His legacy lives on in the <a href="Reformed%20Christian%20confessions%20of%20faith">confessions</a>, liturgy, and church orders of the <a href="Reformed%20churches">Reformed churches</a> of today.

The <a href="Old%20Swiss%20Confederacy">Swiss Confederation</a> in Huldrych Zwingli's time consisted of thirteen states (<a href="Cantons%20of%20Switzerland">cantons</a>) as well as affiliated areas and common lordships. Unlike the modern state of <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, which operates under a federal government, each of the thirteen cantons was nearly independent, conducting its own domestic and foreign affairs. Each canton formed its own alliances within and without the Confederation. This relative independence served as the basis for conflict during the time of the Reformation when the various cantons divided between different confessional camps. Military ambitions gained an additional impetus with the competition to acquire new territory and resources, as seen for example in the <a href="Old%20Z%C3%BCrich%20War">Old Zürich War</a> of 1440–1446.

The wider political environment in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries was also volatile. For centuries the relationship with the Confederation's powerful neighbour, France, determined the foreign policies of the Swiss. Nominally, the Confederation formed a part of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. However, through a succession of wars culminating in the <a href="Swabian%20War">Swabian War</a> in 1499, the Confederation had become "de facto" independent. As the two continental powers and minor regional states such as the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Milan">Duchy of Milan</a>, the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Savoy">Duchy of Savoy</a>, and the <a href="Papal%20States">Papal States</a> competed and fought against each other, there were far-reaching political, economic, and social consequences for the Confederation. During this time the <a href="Swiss%20mercenaries">mercenary pension system</a> became a subject of disagreement. The religious factions of Zwingli's time debated vociferously the merits of sending young Swiss men to fight in foreign wars mainly for the enrichment of the cantonal authorities.

These internal and external factors contributed to the rise of a Confederation national consciousness, in which the term "fatherland" () began to take on meaning beyond a reference to an individual canton. At the same time, <a href="Renaissance%20humanism">Renaissance humanism</a>, with its universal values and emphasis on scholarship (as exemplified by <a href="Erasmus">Erasmus</a> (1466–1536), the "prince of humanism"), had taken root in the Confederation. Within this environment, defined by the confluence of Swiss <a href="patriotism">patriotism</a> and humanism, Zwingli was born in 1484.

Huldrych Zwingli was born on 1 January 1484 in <a href="Wildhaus">Wildhaus</a>, in the <a href="Toggenburg">Toggenburg</a> valley of <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, to a family of farmers, the third child of nine. His father, Ulrich, played a leading role in the administration of the community ("<a href="Amtmann">Amtmann</a>" or chief local magistrate). Zwingli's primary schooling was provided by his uncle, Bartholomew, a cleric in <a href="Weesen">Weesen</a>, where he probably met <a href="Katharina%20von%20Zimmern">Katharina von Zimmern</a>. At ten years old, Zwingli was sent to <a href="Basel">Basel</a> to obtain his secondary education where he learned <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> under Magistrate Gregory Bünzli. After three years in Basel, he stayed a short time in <a href="Bern">Bern</a> with the humanist, Henry Wölfflin. The <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominicans</a> in Bern tried to persuade Zwingli to join their order and it is possible that he was received as a novice. However, his father and uncle disapproved of such a course and he left Bern without completing his Latin studies. He enrolled in the <a href="University%20of%20Vienna">University of Vienna</a> in the winter semester of 1498 but was expelled, according to the university's records. However, it is not certain that Zwingli was indeed expelled, and he re-enrolled in the summer semester of 1500; his activities in 1499 are unknown. Zwingli continued his studies in Vienna until 1502, after which he transferred to the <a href="University%20of%20Basel">University of Basel</a> where he received the Master of Arts degree ("Magister") in 1506.

Zwingli was ordained in <a href="Constance">Constance</a>, the seat of the local diocese, and he celebrated his first <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a> in his hometown, Wildhaus, on 29 September 1506. As a young priest he had studied little theology, but this was not considered unusual at the time. His first ecclesiastical post was the pastorate of the town of <a href="Glarus">Glarus</a>, where he stayed for ten years. It was in Glarus, whose soldiers were used as mercenaries in Europe, that Zwingli became involved in politics. The Swiss Confederation was embroiled in various campaigns with its neighbours: the French, the Habsburgs, and the Papal States. Zwingli placed himself solidly on the side of the <a href="Holy%20See">Roman See</a>. In return, <a href="Pope%20Julius%20II">Pope Julius II</a> honoured Zwingli by providing him with an annual pension. He took the role of chaplain in several campaigns in Italy, including the <a href="Battle%20of%20Novara%20%281513%29">Battle of Novara</a> in 1513. However, the decisive defeat of the Swiss in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Marignano">Battle of Marignano</a> caused a shift in mood in Glarus in favour of the French rather than the pope. Zwingli, the papal partisan, found himself in a difficult position and he decided to retreat to <a href="Einsiedeln%2C%20Switzerland">Einsiedeln</a> in the <a href="canton%20of%20Schwyz">canton of Schwyz</a>. By this time, he had become convinced that mercenary service was immoral and that Swiss unity was indispensable for any future achievements. Some of his earliest extant writings, such as "The Ox" (1510) and "The Labyrinth" (1516), attacked the mercenary system using allegory and satire. His countrymen were presented as virtuous people within a French, imperial, and papal triangle. Zwingli stayed in Einsiedeln for two years during which he withdrew completely from politics in favour of ecclesiastical activities and personal studies.

Zwingli's time as the pastor of Glarus and Einsiedeln was characterized by inner growth and development. He perfected his <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> and he took up the study of <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>. His library contained over three hundred volumes from which he was able to draw upon <a href="Classics">classical</a>, <a href="patristic">patristic</a>, and <a href="Scholasticism">scholastic</a> works. He exchanged scholarly letters with a circle of Swiss humanists and began to study the writings of Erasmus. Zwingli took the opportunity to meet him while Erasmus was in Basel between August 1514 and May 1516. Zwingli's turn to relative <a href="pacifism">pacifism</a> and his focus on preaching can be traced to the influence of Erasmus.

In late 1518, the post of the "Leutpriestertum" (people's priest) of the <a href="Grossm%C3%BCnster">Grossmünster</a> at <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a> became vacant. The <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canons</a> of the foundation that administered the Grossmünster recognised Zwingli's reputation as a fine preacher and writer. His connection with humanists was a decisive factor as several canons were sympathetic to Erasmian reform. In addition, his opposition to the French and to mercenary service was welcomed by Zürich politicians. On 11 December 1518, the canons elected Zwingli to become the stipendiary priest and on 27 December he moved permanently to Zürich.

On 1 January 1519, Zwingli gave his first sermon in Zürich. Deviating from the prevalent practice of basing a sermon on the Gospel lesson of a particular Sunday, Zwingli, using <a href="Erasmus">Erasmus</a>' New Testament as a guide, began to read through the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a>, giving his interpretation during the sermon, known as the method of "<a href="lectio%20continua">lectio continua</a>". He continued to read and interpret the book on subsequent Sundays until he reached the end and then proceeded in the same manner with the <a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>, the New Testament <a href="epistles">epistles</a>, and finally the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>. His motives for doing this are not clear, but in his sermons he used exhortation to achieve moral and ecclesiastical improvement which were goals comparable with Erasmian reform. Sometime after 1520, Zwingli's theological model began to evolve into an idiosyncratic form that was neither Erasmian nor <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a>. Scholars do not agree on the process of how he developed his own unique model. One view is that Zwingli was trained as an Erasmian humanist and Luther played a decisive role in changing his theology. Another view is that Zwingli did not pay much attention to Luther's theology and in fact he considered it as part of the humanist reform movement. A third view is that Zwingli was not a complete follower of Erasmus, but had diverged from him as early as 1516 and that he independently developed his theology.

Zwingli's theological stance was gradually revealed through his sermons. He attacked moral corruption and in the process he named individuals who were the targets of his denunciations. Monks were accused of indolence and high living. In 1519, Zwingli specifically rejected the <a href="veneration">veneration</a> of saints and called for the need to distinguish between their true and fictional accounts. He cast doubts on hellfire, asserted that unbaptised children were not damned, and questioned the power of <a href="excommunication">excommunication</a>. His attack on the claim that <a href="Tithe">tithing</a> was a divine institution, however, had the greatest theological and social impact. This contradicted the immediate economic interests of the foundation. One of the elderly canons who had supported Zwingli's election, Konrad Hofmann, complained about his sermons in a letter. Some canons supported Hofmann, but the opposition never grew very large. Zwingli insisted that he was not an innovator and that the <a href="Sola%20scriptura">sole basis of his teachings was Scripture</a>.

Within the <a href="Bishopric%20of%20Constance">diocese of Constance</a>, Bernhardin Sanson was offering a special <a href="indulgence">indulgence</a> for contributors to the building of <a href="St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica">St Peter's</a> in Rome. When Sanson arrived at the gates of Zürich at the end of January 1519, parishioners prompted Zwingli with questions. He responded with displeasure that the people were not being properly informed about the conditions of the indulgence and were being induced to part with their money on false pretences. This was over a year after <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> published his <a href="Ninety-five%20theses">Ninety-five theses</a> (31 October 1517). The council of Zürich refused Sanson entry into the city. As the authorities in Rome were anxious to contain the fire started by Luther, the Bishop of Constance denied any support of Sanson and he was recalled.

In August 1519, Zürich was struck by an outbreak of the <a href="Bubonic%20plague">plague</a> during which at least one in four persons died. All of those who could afford it left the city, but Zwingli remained and continued his pastoral duties. In September, he caught the disease and nearly died. He described his preparation for death in a poem, Zwingli's "Pestlied", consisting of three parts: the onset of the illness, the closeness to death, and the joy of recovery. The final verses of the first part read:

In the years following his recovery, Zwingli's opponents remained in the minority. When a vacancy occurred among the canons of the Grossmünster, Zwingli was elected to fulfill that vacancy on 29 April 1521. In becoming a canon, he became a full citizen of Zürich. He also retained his post as the people's priest of the Grossmünster.

The first public controversy regarding Zwingli's preaching broke out during the season of <a href="Lent">Lent</a> in 1522. On the first fasting Sunday, 9 March, Zwingli and about a dozen other participants consciously transgressed the fasting rule by cutting and distributing two smoked sausages (the "Wurstessen" in <a href="Christoph%20Froschauer">Christoph Froschauer</a>'s workshop). Zwingli defended this act in a sermon which was published on 16 April, under the title "Von Erkiesen und Freiheit der Speisen" (Regarding the Choice and Freedom of Foods). He noted that no general valid rule on food can be derived from the Bible and that to transgress such a rule is not a sin. The event, which came to be referred to as the <a href="Affair%20of%20the%20Sausages">Affair of the Sausages</a>, is considered to be the start of the Reformation in Switzerland. Even before the publication of this treatise, the diocese of Constance reacted by sending a delegation to Zürich. The city council condemned the fasting violation, but assumed responsibility over ecclesiastical matters and requested the religious authorities clarify the issue. The bishop responded on 24 May by admonishing the Grossmünster and city council and repeating the traditional position.

Following this event, Zwingli and other humanist friends petitioned the bishop on 2 July to abolish the requirement of celibacy on the clergy. Two weeks later the petition was reprinted for the public in German as "Eine freundliche Bitte und Ermahnung an die Eidgenossen" (A Friendly Petition and Admonition to the Confederates). The issue was not just an abstract problem for Zwingli, as he had secretly married a widow, Anna Reinhard, earlier in the year. Their cohabitation was well-known and their public wedding took place on 2 April 1524, three months before the birth of their first child. They would eventually have four children: Regula, William, Huldrych, and Anna. As the petition was addressed to the secular authorities, the bishop responded at the same level by notifying the Zürich government to maintain the ecclesiastical order. Other Swiss clergymen joined in Zwingli's cause which encouraged him to make his first major statement of faith, "Apologeticus Archeteles" (The First and Last Word). He defended himself against charges of inciting unrest and heresy. He denied the ecclesiastical hierarchy any right to judge on matters of church order because of its corrupted state.

The events of 1522 brought no clarification on the issues. Not only did the unrest between Zürich and the bishop continue, tensions were growing among Zürich's Confederation partners in the <a href="Tagsatzung">Swiss Diet</a>. On 22 December, the Diet recommended that its members prohibit the new teachings, a strong indictment directed at Zürich. The city council felt obliged to take the initiative and find its own solution.

On 3 January 1523, the Zürich city council invited the clergy of the city and outlying region to a meeting to allow the factions to present their opinions. The bishop was invited to attend or to send a representative. The council would render a decision on who would be allowed to continue to proclaim their views. This meeting, the first Zürich disputation, took place on 29 January 1523.

The meeting attracted a large crowd of approximately six hundred participants. The bishop sent a delegation led by his <a href="vicar%20general">vicar general</a>, <a href="Johann%20Faber">Johannes Fabri</a>. Zwingli summarised his position in the "Schlussreden" (Concluding Statements or the Sixty-seven Articles). Fabri, who had not envisaged an academic disputation in the manner Zwingli had prepared for, was forbidden to discuss high theology before laymen, and simply insisted on the necessity of the ecclesiastical authority. The decision of the council was that Zwingli would be allowed to continue his preaching and that all other preachers should teach only in accordance with Scripture.

In September 1523, <a href="Leo%20Jud">Leo Jud</a>, Zwingli's closest friend and colleague and pastor of <a href="St.%20Peter%2C%20Z%C3%BCrich">St. Peterskirche</a>, publicly called for the removal of statues of saints and other icons. This led to demonstrations and <a href="Iconoclasm">iconoclastic</a> activities. The city council decided to work out the matter of images in a second disputation. The essence of the <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">mass</a> and its sacrificial character was also included as a subject of discussion. Supporters of the mass claimed that the eucharist was a true sacrifice, while Zwingli claimed that it was a commemorative meal. As in the first disputation, an invitation was sent out to the Zürich clergy and the bishop of Constance. This time, however, the lay people of Zürich, the dioceses of <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Chur">Chur</a> and Basel, the University of Basel, and the twelve members of the Confederation were also invited. About nine hundred persons attended this meeting, but neither the bishop nor the Confederation sent representatives. The disputation started on 26 October 1523 and lasted two days.

Zwingli again took the lead in the disputation. His opponent was the aforementioned canon, Konrad Hofmann, who had initially supported Zwingli's election. Also taking part was a group of young men demanding a much faster pace of reformation, who among other things pleaded for replacing <a href="infant%20baptism">infant baptism</a> with <a href="Credobaptism">adult baptism</a>. This group was led by <a href="Conrad%20Grebel">Conrad Grebel</a>, one of the initiators of the <a href="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a> movement. During the first three days of dispute, although the controversy of images and the mass were discussed, the arguments led to the question of whether the city council or the ecclesiastical government had the authority to decide on these issues. At this point, Konrad Schmid, a priest from <a href="Aargau">Aargau</a> and follower of Zwingli, made a pragmatic suggestion. As images were not yet considered to be valueless by everyone, he suggested that pastors preach on this subject under threat of punishment. He believed the opinions of the people would gradually change and the voluntary removal of images would follow. Hence, Schmid rejected the radicals and their iconoclasm, but supported Zwingli's position. In November the council passed ordinances in support of Schmid's motion. Zwingli wrote a booklet on the evangelical duties of a minister, "Kurze, christliche Einleitung" (Short Christian Introduction), and the council sent it out to the clergy and the members of the Confederation.

In December 1523, the council set a deadline of <a href="Pentecost">Pentecost</a> in 1524 for a solution to the elimination of the mass and images. Zwingli gave a formal opinion in "Vorschlag wegen der Bilder und der Messe" (Proposal Concerning Images and the Mass). He did not urge an immediate, general abolition. The council decided on the orderly removal of images within Zürich, but rural congregations were granted the right to remove them based on majority vote. The decision on the mass was postponed.

Evidence of the effect of the Reformation was seen in early 1524. <a href="Candlemas">Candlemas</a> was not celebrated, processions of robed clergy ceased, worshippers did not go with palms or relics on <a href="Palm%20Sunday">Palm Sunday</a> to the <a href="Lindenhof">Lindenhof</a>, and <a href="triptych">triptych</a>s remained covered and closed after <a href="Lent">Lent</a>. Opposition to the changes came from Konrad Hofmann and his followers, but the council decided in favour of keeping the government mandates. When Hofmann left the city, opposition from pastors hostile to the Reformation broke down. The bishop of Constance tried to intervene in defending the mass and the veneration of images. Zwingli wrote an official response for the council and the result was the severance of all ties between the city and the diocese.

Although the council had hesitated in abolishing the mass, the decrease in the exercise of traditional piety allowed pastors to be unofficially released from the requirement of celebrating mass. As individual pastors altered their practices as each saw fit, Zwingli was prompted to address this disorganised situation by designing a communion liturgy in the German language. This was published in "Aktion oder Brauch des Nachtmahls" (Act or Custom of the Supper). Shortly before <a href="Easter">Easter</a>, Zwingli and his closest associates requested the council to cancel the mass and to introduce the new public order of worship. On <a href="Maundy%20Thursday">Maundy Thursday</a>, 13 April 1525, Zwingli celebrated communion under his new liturgy. Wooden cups and plates were used to avoid any outward displays of formality. The congregation sat at set tables to emphasise the meal aspect of the sacrament. The sermon was the focal point of the service and there was no organ music or singing. The importance of the sermon in the worship service was underlined by Zwingli's proposal to limit the celebration of communion to four times a year.

For some time Zwingli had accused <a href="mendicant">mendicant</a> orders of hypocrisy and demanded their abolition in order to support the truly poor. He suggested the monasteries be changed into hospitals and welfare institutions and incorporate their wealth into a welfare fund. This was done by reorganising the foundations of the Grossmünster and <a href="Fraum%C3%BCnster">Fraumünster</a> and pensioning off remaining nuns and monks. The council secularised the church properties (Fraumünster handed over by Zwingli's acquaintance <a href="Katharina%20von%20Zimmern">Katharina von Zimmern</a>) and established new welfare programs for the poor. Zwingli requested permission to establish a Latin school, the "Prophezei" (Prophecy) or <a href="Carolinum%2C%20Z%C3%BCrich">"Carolinum"</a>, at the Grossmünster. The council agreed and it was officially opened on 19 June 1525 with Zwingli and Jud as teachers. It served to retrain and re-educate the clergy. The <a href="Z%C3%BCrich%20Bible">Zürich Bible</a> translation, traditionally attributed to Zwingli and printed by <a href="Christoph%20Froschauer">Christoph Froschauer</a>, bears the mark of teamwork from the Prophecy school. Scholars have not yet attempted to clarify Zwingli's share of the work based on external and stylistic evidence.

Shortly after the second Zürich disputation, many in the <a href="Radical%20Reformation">radical wing of the Reformation</a> became convinced that Zwingli was making too many concessions to the Zürich council. They rejected the role of civil government and demanded the immediate establishment of a congregation of the faithful. <a href="Conrad%20Grebel">Conrad Grebel</a>, the leader of the radicals and the emerging Anabaptist movement, spoke disparagingly of Zwingli in private. On 15 August 1524 the council insisted on the obligation to baptise all newborn infants. Zwingli secretly conferred with Grebel's group and late in 1524, the council called for official discussions. When talks were broken off, Zwingli published "Wer Ursache gebe zu Aufruhr" (Whoever Causes Unrest) clarifying the opposing points-of-view. On 17 January 1525 a public debate was held and the council decided in favour of Zwingli. Anyone refusing to have their children baptised was required to leave Zürich. The radicals ignored these measures and on 21 January, they met at the house of the mother of another radical leader, <a href="Felix%20Manz">Felix Manz</a>. Grebel and a third leader, <a href="George%20Blaurock">George Blaurock</a>, performed the first recorded Anabaptist <a href="Credobaptism">adult baptisms</a>.

On February 2, the council repeated the requirement on the baptism of all babies and some who failed to comply were arrested and fined, Manz and Blaurock among them. Zwingli and Jud interviewed them and more debates were held before the Zürich council. Meanwhile, the new teachings continued to spread to other parts of the Confederation as well as a number of <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a>n towns. On 6–8 November, the last debate on the subject of baptism took place in the Grossmünster. Grebel, Manz, and Blaurock defended their cause before Zwingli, Jud, and other reformers. There was no serious exchange of views as each side would not move from their positions and the debates degenerated into an uproar, each side shouting abuse at the other.

The Zürich council decided that no compromise was possible. On 7 March 1526 it released the notorious mandate that no one shall rebaptise another under the penalty of death. Although Zwingli, technically, had nothing to do with the mandate, there is no indication that he disapproved. Felix Manz, who had sworn to leave Zürich and not to baptise any more, had deliberately returned and continued the practice. After he was arrested and tried, he was executed on 5 January 1527 by being drowned in the <a href="Limmat">Limmat</a>. He was the first Anabaptist martyr; three more were to follow, after which all others either fled or were expelled from Zürich.

On 8 April 1524, five cantons, <a href="Canton%20of%20Lucerne">Lucerne</a>, <a href="Canton%20of%20Uri">Uri</a>, <a href="Canton%20of%20Schwyz">Schwyz</a>, <a href="Unterwalden">Unterwalden</a>, and <a href="Canton%20of%20Zug">Zug</a>, formed an alliance, "die fünf Orte" (the Five States) to defend themselves from Zwingli's Reformation. They contacted the opponents of Martin Luther including <a href="John%20Eck">John Eck</a>, who had debated Luther in the <a href="Leipzig%20Disputation">Leipzig Disputation</a> of 1519. Eck offered to dispute Zwingli and he accepted. However, they could not agree on the selection of the judging authority, the location of the debate, and the use of the Swiss Diet as a court. Because of the disagreements, Zwingli decided to boycott the disputation. On 19 May 1526, all the cantons sent delegates to <a href="Baden%2C%20Switzerland">Baden</a>. Although Zürich's representatives were present, they did not participate in the sessions. Eck led the Catholic party while the reformers were represented by <a href="Johannes%20Oecolampadius">Johannes Oecolampadius</a> of Basel, a theologian from <a href="W%C3%BCrttemberg">Württemberg</a> who had carried on an extensive and friendly correspondence with Zwingli. While the debate proceeded, Zwingli was kept informed of the proceedings and printed pamphlets giving his opinions. It was of little use as the Diet decided against Zwingli. He was to be banned and his writings were no longer to be distributed. Of the thirteen Confederation members, <a href="Canton%20of%20Glarus">Glarus</a>, <a href="Canton%20of%20Solothurn">Solothurn</a>, <a href="Canton%20of%20Fribourg">Fribourg</a>, and <a href="Appenzell">Appenzell</a> as well as the Five States voted against Zwingli. <a href="Canton%20of%20Bern">Bern</a>, <a href="Canton%20of%20Basel">Basel</a>, <a href="Canton%20of%20Schaffhausen">Schaffhausen</a>, and <a href="Canton%20of%20Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a> supported him.

The Baden disputation exposed a deep rift in the Confederation on matters of religion. The Reformation was now emerging in other states. The city of <a href="St%20Gallen">St Gallen</a>, an affiliated state to the Confederation, was led by a reformed mayor, <a href="Joachim%20Vadian">Joachim Vadian</a>, and the city abolished the mass in 1527, just two years after Zürich. In Basel, although Zwingli had a close relationship with Oecolampadius, the government did not officially sanction any reformatory changes until 1 April 1529 when the mass was prohibited. Schaffhausen, which had closely followed Zürich's example, formally adopted the Reformation in September 1529. In the case of Bern, <a href="Berchtold%20Haller">Berchtold Haller</a>, the priest at <a href="M%C3%BCnster%20of%20Berne">St Vincent Münster</a>, and <a href="Niklaus%20Manuel">Niklaus Manuel</a>, the poet, painter, and politician, had campaigned for the reformed cause. But it was only after another disputation that Bern counted itself as a canton of the Reformation. Four hundred and fifty persons participated, including pastors from Bern and other cantons as well as theologians from outside the Confederation such as <a href="Martin%20Bucer">Martin Bucer</a> and <a href="Wolfgang%20Capito">Wolfgang Capito</a> from <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>, <a href="Ambrosius%20Blarer">Ambrosius Blarer</a> from <a href="Konstanz">Constance</a>, and <a href="Andreas%20Althamer">Andreas Althamer</a> from <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>. Eck and Fabri refused to attend and the Catholic cantons did not send representatives. The meeting started on 6 January 1528 and lasted nearly three weeks. Zwingli assumed the main burden of defending the Reformation and he preached twice in the Münster. On 7 February 1528 the council decreed that the Reformation be established in Bern.

Even before the Bern disputation, Zwingli was canvassing for an alliance of reformed cities. Once Bern officially accepted the Reformation, a new alliance, "das Christliche <a href="Burgrecht">Burgrecht</a>" (the Christian Civic Union) was created. The first meetings were held in Bern between representatives of Bern, Constance, and Zürich on 5–6 January 1528. Other cities, including Basel, <a href="Biel">Biel</a>, <a href="M%C3%BClhausen">Mülhausen</a>, Schaffhausen, and St Gallen, eventually joined the alliance. The Five (Catholic) States felt encircled and isolated, so they searched for outside allies. After two months of negotiations, the Five States formed "die Christliche Vereinigung" (the Christian Alliance) with <a href="Ferdinand%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Ferdinand of Austria</a> on 22 April 1529.
Soon after the Austrian treaty was signed, a reformed preacher, Jacob Kaiser, was captured in <a href="Uznach">Uznach</a> and executed in Schwyz. This triggered a strong reaction from Zwingli; he drafted "Ratschlag über den Krieg" (Advice About the War) for the government. He outlined justifications for an attack on the Catholic states and other measures to be taken. Before Zürich could implement his plans, a delegation from Bern that included Niklaus Manuel arrived in Zürich. The delegation called on Zürich to settle the matter peacefully. Manuel added that an attack would expose Bern to further dangers as Catholic <a href="Valais">Valais</a> and the Duchy of Savoy bordered its southern flank. He then noted, "You cannot really bring faith by means of spears and halberds." Zürich, however, decided that it would act alone, knowing that Bern would be obliged to acquiesce. War was declared on 8 June 1529. Zürich was able to raise an army of 30,000 men. The Five States were abandoned by Austria and could raise only 9,000 men. The two forces met near <a href="Kappel%20am%20Albis">Kappel</a>, but war was averted due to the intervention of Hans Aebli, a relative of Zwingli, who pleaded for an armistice.

Zwingli was obliged to state the terms of the armistice. He demanded the dissolution of the Christian Alliance; unhindered preaching by reformers in the Catholic states; prohibition of the pension system; payment of war reparations; and compensation to the children of Jacob Kaiser. Manuel was involved in the negotiations. Bern was not prepared to insist on the unhindered preaching or the prohibition of the pension system. Zürich and Bern could not agree and the Five (Catholic) States pledged only to dissolve their alliance with Austria. This was a bitter disappointment for Zwingli and it marked his decline in political influence. The first Land Peace of Kappel, "der erste <a href="Landfriede">Landfriede</a>", ended the war on 24 June.

While Zwingli carried on the political work of the Swiss Reformation, he developed his theological views with his colleagues. The famous disagreement between Luther and Zwingli on the interpretation of the <a href="eucharist">eucharist</a> originated when <a href="Andreas%20Karlstadt">Andreas Karlstadt</a>, Luther's former colleague from <a href="Wittenberg">Wittenberg</a>, published three pamphlets on the Lord's Supper in which Karlstadt rejected the idea of a <a href="real%20presence">real presence</a> in the elements. These pamphlets, published in Basel in 1524, received the approval of Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Luther rejected Karlstadt's arguments and considered Zwingli primarily to be a partisan of Karlstadt. Zwingli began to express his thoughts on the eucharist in several publications including "de Eucharistia" (On the Eucharist). He attacked the idea of the real presence and argued that the word "is" in the <a href="Words%20of%20Institution">words of the institution</a>—"This is my body, this is my blood"—means "signifies". Hence, the words are understood as a metaphor and Zwingli claimed that there was no real presence during the eucharist. In effect, the meal was symbolic of the <a href="Last%20Supper">Last Supper</a>.

By spring 1527, Luther reacted strongly to Zwingli's views in the treatise "Dass Diese Worte Christi "Das ist mein Leib etc." noch fest stehen wider die Schwarmgeister" (That These Words of Christ "This is My Body etc." Still Stand Firm Against the Fanatics). The controversy continued until 1528 when efforts to build bridges between the Lutheran and the Zwinglian views began. <a href="Martin%20Butzer">Martin Bucer</a> tried to mediate while <a href="Philip%20of%20Hesse">Philip of Hesse</a>, who wanted to form a political coalition of all Protestant forces, invited the two parties to <a href="Marburg">Marburg</a> to discuss their differences. This event became known as the <a href="Marburg%20Colloquy">Marburg Colloquy</a>.

Zwingli accepted Philip's invitation fully believing that he would be able to convince Luther. By contrast, Luther did not expect anything to come out of the meeting and had to be urged by Philip to attend. Zwingli, accompanied by Oecolampadius, arrived on 28 September 1529 with Luther and <a href="Philipp%20Melanchthon">Philipp Melanchthon</a> arriving shortly thereafter. Other theologians also participated including Martin Bucer, <a href="Andreas%20Osiander">Andreas Osiander</a>, <a href="Johannes%20Brenz">Johannes Brenz</a>, and <a href="Justus%20Jonas">Justus Jonas</a>. The debates were held from 1–3 October and the results were published in the fifteen "Marburg Articles". The participants were able to agree on fourteen of the articles, but the fifteenth article established the differences in their views on the presence of Christ in the eucharist. Afterwards, each side was convinced that they were the victors, but in fact the controversy was not resolved and the final result was the formation of two different Protestant confessions.

With the failure of the Marburg Colloquy and the split of the Confederation, Zwingli set his goal on an alliance with <a href="Philip%20of%20Hesse">Philip of Hesse</a>. He kept up a lively correspondence with Philip. Bern refused to participate, but after a long process, Zürich, Basel, and Strasbourg signed a mutual defence treaty with Philip in November 1530. Zwingli also personally negotiated with France's diplomatic representative, but the two sides were too far apart. France wanted to maintain good relations with the Five States. Approaches to Venice and Milan also failed.

As Zwingli was working on establishing these political alliances, <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V</a>, the Holy Roman Emperor, invited Protestants to the <a href="Augsburg%20Diet">Augsburg Diet</a> to present their views so that he could make a verdict on the issue of faith. The Lutherans presented the <a href="Augsburg%20Confession">Augsburg Confession</a>. Under the leadership of Martin Bucer, the cities of Strasbourg, Constance, <a href="Memmingen">Memmingen</a>, and <a href="Lindau">Lindau</a> produced the <a href="Tetrapolitan%20Confession">Tetrapolitan Confession</a>. This document attempted to take a middle position between the Lutherans and Zwinglians. It was too late for the "Burgrecht" cities to produce a confession of their own. Zwingli then produced his own private confession, "Fidei ratio" (Account of Faith) in which he explained his faith in twelve articles conforming to the articles of the <a href="Apostles%27%20Creed">Apostles' Creed</a>. The tone was strongly anti-Catholic as well as anti-Lutheran. The Lutherans did not react officially, but criticised it privately. Zwingli's and Luther's old opponent, <a href="Johann%20Eck">Johann Eck</a>, counter-attacked with a publication, "Refutation of the Articles Zwingli Submitted to the Emperor".

When Philip of Hesse formed the <a href="Schmalkaldic%20League">Schmalkaldic League</a> at the end of 1530, the four cities of the Tetrapolitan Confession joined on the basis of a Lutheran interpretation of that confession. Given the flexibility of the league's entrance requirements, Zürich, Basel, and Bern also considered joining. However, Zwingli could not reconcile the Tetrapolitan Confession with his own beliefs and wrote a harsh refusal to Bucer and Capito. This offended Philip to the point where relations with the League were severed. The "Burgrecht" cities now had no external allies to help deal with internal Confederation religious conflicts.

The peace treaty of the First Kappel War did not define the right of unhindered preaching in the Catholic states. Zwingli interpreted this to mean that preaching should be permitted, but the Five States suppressed any attempts to reform. The "Burgrecht" cities considered different means of applying pressure to the Five States. Basel and Schaffhausen preferred quiet diplomacy while Zürich wanted armed conflict. Zwingli and Jud unequivocally advocated an attack on the Five States. Bern took a middle position which eventually prevailed. In May 1531, Zürich reluctantly agreed to impose a food blockade. It failed to have any effect and in October, Bern decided to withdraw the blockade. Zürich urged its continuation and the "Burgrecht" cities began to quarrel among themselves.

On 9 October 1531, in a surprise move, the Five States declared war on Zürich. Zürich's mobilisation was slow due to internal squabbling and on 11 October, 3500 poorly deployed men encountered a Five States force nearly double their size near Kappel. Many pastors, including Zwingli, were among the soldiers. The battle lasted less than one hour and Zwingli was among the 500 casualties in the Zürich army.

Zwingli had considered himself first and foremost a soldier of Christ; second a defender of his country, the Confederation; and third a leader of his city, Zürich, where he had lived for the previous twelve years. Ironically, he died at the age of 47, not for Christ nor for the Confederation, but for Zürich. 
In Tabletalk, Luther is recorded saying: "They say that Zwingli recently died thus; if his error had prevailed, we would have perished, and our church with us. It was a judgment of God. That was always a proud people. The others, the papists, will probably also be dealt with by our Lord God."
. Erasmus wrote, "We are freed from great fear by the death of the two preachers, Zwingli and <a href="Oecolampadius">Oecolampadius</a>, whose fate has wrought an incredible change in the mind of many. This is the wonderful hand of God on high." Oecolampadius had died on 24 November. Erasmus also wrote, "If <a href="Bellona%20%28goddess%29">Bellona</a> had favoured them, it would have been all over with us."

According to Zwingli, the cornerstone of theology is the Bible. Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. He placed its authority above other sources such as the <a href="ecumenical%20councils">ecumenical councils</a> or the <a href="Church%20Fathers">Church Fathers</a>, although he did not hesitate to use other sources to support his arguments. The principles that guide Zwingli's interpretations are derived from his rationalist humanist education and his Reformed understanding of the Bible. He rejected literalist interpretations of a passage, such as those of the Anabaptists, and used <a href="synecdoche">synecdoche</a> and analogies, methods he describes in "A Friendly Exegesis" (1527). Two analogies that he used quite effectively were between baptism and <a href="circumcision">circumcision</a> and between the eucharist and <a href="Passover">Passover</a>. He also paid attention to the immediate context and attempted to understand the purpose behind it, comparing passages of scripture with each other.
Zwingli rejected the word "sacrament" in the popular usage of his time. For ordinary people, the word meant some kind of holy action of which there is inherent power to free the conscience from sin. For Zwingli, a sacrament was an initiatory ceremony or a pledge, pointing out that the word was derived from "sacramentum" meaning an oath. (However, the word is also translated "mystery".) In his early writings on baptism, he noted that baptism was an example of such a pledge. He challenged Catholics by accusing them of superstition when they ascribed the water of baptism a certain power to wash away sin. Later, in his conflict with the Anabaptists, he defended the practice of infant baptism, noting that there is no law forbidding the practice. He argued that baptism was a sign of a covenant with God, thereby replacing circumcision in the Old Testament.

Zwingli approached the eucharist in a similar manner to baptism. During the first Zürich disputation in 1523, he denied that an actual sacrifice occurred during the mass, arguing that Christ made the sacrifice only once and for all eternity. Hence, the eucharist was "a memorial of the sacrifice". Following this argument, he further developed his view, coming to the conclusion of the "signifies" interpretation for the words of the institution. He used various passages of scripture to argue against <a href="transubstantiation">transubstantiation</a> as well as Luther's views, the key text being John 6:63, "It is the Spirit who gives life, the flesh is of no avail". Zwingli's approach and interpretation of scripture to understand the meaning of the eucharist was one reason he could not reach a consensus with Luther.

The impact of Luther on Zwingli's theological development has long been a source of interest and discussion among Zwinglian scholars. Zwingli himself asserted vigorously his independence of Luther. The most recent studies have lent credibility to this claim, although some scholars still argue his theology was dependent upon Luther's. Zwingli appears to have read Luther's books in search of confirmation from Luther for his own views. Zwingli did, however, admire Luther greatly for the stand he took against the pope. This, more than Luther's theology, was a key influence on Zwingli's convictions as a reformer. What Zwingli considered Luther's courageous stance at the <a href="Leipzig%20Disputation">Leipzig Disputation</a> had a decisive impact on Zwingli during his earliest years as a priest, and during this time Zwingli praised and promoted Luther's writings to support his own similar ideas. Like Luther, Zwingli was also a student and admirer of <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine</a>. His later writings continued to show characteristic differences from Luther such as the inclusion of non-Christians in heaven as described in "An Exposition of the Faith".

Zwingli enjoyed music and could play several instruments, including the <a href="violin">violin</a>, <a href="harp">harp</a>, <a href="flute">flute</a>, <a href="dulcimer">dulcimer</a> and <a href="hunting%20horn">hunting horn</a>. He would sometimes amuse the children of his congregation on his <a href="lute">lute</a> and was so well known for his playing that his enemies mocked him as "the evangelical lute-player and fifer". Three of Zwingli's "<a href="Lied">Lied</a>er" or hymns have been preserved: the "Pestlied" mentioned above, an adaptation of <a href="Psalms">Psalm</a> 65 (c. 1525), and the "Kappeler Lied", which is believed to have been composed during the campaign of the first war of Kappel (1529). These songs were not meant to be sung during worship services and are not identified as hymns of the Reformation, though they were published in some 16th-century hymnals.

Zwingli criticised the practice of priestly chanting and monastic choirs. The criticism dates from 1523 when he attacked certain worship practices. His arguments are detailed in the Conclusions of 1525, in which, Conclusions 44, 45 and 46 are concerned with musical practices under the rubric of "prayer". He associated music with images and vestments, all of which he felt diverted people's attention from true spiritual worship. It is not known what he thought of the musical practices in early Lutheran churches. Zwingli, however, eliminated instrumental music from worship in the church, stating that God had not commanded it in worship. The organist of the People's Church in Zürich is recorded as weeping upon seeing the great organ broken up. Although Zwingli did not express an opinion on congregational singing, he made no effort to encourage it. Nevertheless, scholars have found that Zwingli was supportive of a role for music in the church. Gottfried W. Locher writes, "The old assertion 'Zwingli was against church singing' holds good no longer ... Zwingli's polemic is concerned exclusively with the medieval Latin choral and priestly chanting and not with the hymns of evangelical congregations or choirs". Locher goes on to say that "Zwingli freely allowed vernacular psalm or choral singing. In addition, he even seems to have striven for lively, antiphonal, unison recitative". Locher then summarizes his comments on Zwingli's view of church music as follows: "The chief thought in his conception of worship was always 'conscious attendance and understanding'—'devotion', yet with the lively participation of all concerned".

Today's <a href="Musikabteilung">Musikabteilung</a> (literally: music departement), located in the choir of the <a href="Predigerkirche%20Z%C3%BCrich">"Predigern" church in Zürich</a> was founded in 1971, and forms a scientific music collection of European importance. It publishes the materials entrusted to it at irregular intervals as CDs. The repertoire ranges from the early 16th-century spiritual music of Huldrych Zwingli to music of the late 20th century, published under the label "Musik aus der Zentralbibliothek Zürich".

Zwingli was a humanist and a scholar with many devoted friends and disciples. He communicated as easily with the ordinary people of his congregation as with rulers such as <a href="Philip%20of%20Hesse">Philip of Hesse</a>. His reputation as a stern, stolid reformer is counterbalanced by the fact that he had an excellent sense of humour and used satiric fables, spoofing, and puns in his writings. He was more conscious of social obligations than Luther and he genuinely believed that the masses would accept a government guided by God's word. He tirelessly promoted assistance to the poor, who he believed should be cared for by a truly Christian community.

In December 1531, the Zürich council selected <a href="Heinrich%20Bullinger">Heinrich Bullinger</a> as his successor. He immediately removed any doubts about Zwingli's orthodoxy and defended him as a prophet and a martyr. During Bullinger's rule, the confessional divisions of the Confederation were stabilised. He rallied the reformed cities and cantons and helped them to recover from the defeat at Kappel. Zwingli had instituted fundamental reforms, while Bullinger consolidated and refined them.

Scholars have found it difficult to assess Zwingli's impact on history, for several reasons. There is no consensus on the definition of "Zwinglianism"; by any definition, Zwinglianism evolved under his successor, Heinrich Bullinger; and research into Zwingli's influence on Bullinger and <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a> is still rudimentary. Bullinger adopted most of Zwingli's points of doctrine. Like Zwingli, he summarised his theology several times, the best-known being the <a href="Second%20Helvetic%20Confession">Second Helvetic Confession</a> of 1566. Meanwhile, Calvin had taken over the Reformation in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>. Calvin differed with Zwingli on the eucharist and criticised him for regarding it as simply a metaphorical event. In 1549, however, Bullinger and Calvin succeeded in overcoming the differences in doctrine and produced the "<a href="Consensus%20Tigurinus">Consensus Tigurinus</a>" (Zürich Consensus). They declared that the eucharist was not just symbolic of the meal, but they also rejected the Lutheran position that the body and blood of Christ is in <a href="Sacramental%20union">union with the elements</a>. With this rapprochement, Calvin established his role in the <a href="Swiss%20Reformed%20Church">Swiss Reformed Church</a>es and eventually in the wider world.

Outside of Switzerland, no church counts Zwingli as its founder. Scholars speculate as to why Zwinglianism has not diffused more widely, even though Zwingli's theology is considered the first expression of <a href="Reformed%20theology">Reformed theology</a>. Although his name is not widely recognised, Zwingli's legacy lives on in the basic confessions of the <a href="Reformed%20churches">Reformed churches</a> of today. He is often called, after <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> and <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a>, the "Third Man of the Reformation".

Zwingli's collected works are expected to fill 21 volumes. A collection of selected works was published in 1995 by the "Zwingliverein" in collaboration with the "Theologischer Verlag Zürich" This four-volume collection contains the following works:

The complete 21-volume edition is being undertaken by the "Zwingliverein" in collaboration with the "Institut für schweizerische Reformationsgeschichte", and is projected to be organised as follows:

Vols. XIII and XIV have been published, vols. XV and XVI are under preparation. Vols. XVII to XXI are planned to cover the New Testament.

Older German / Latin editions available online include:

Hydrus

Hydrus is a small <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the deep <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">southern sky</a>. It was one of twelve constellations created by <a href="Petrus%20Plancius">Petrus Plancius</a> from the observations of <a href="Pieter%20Dirkszoon%20Keyser">Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser</a> and <a href="Frederick%20de%20Houtman">Frederick de Houtman</a> and it first appeared on a 35-cm (14 in) diameter celestial globe published in late 1597 (or early 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius and <a href="Jodocus%20Hondius">Jodocus Hondius</a>. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>'s <a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a> of 1603. The French explorer and astronomer <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</a> charted the brighter <a href="star">star</a>s and gave their <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s in 1756. Its name means "male water snake", as opposed to <a href="Hydra%20%28constellation%29">Hydra</a>, a much larger constellation that represents a female water snake. It remains below the horizon for most <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a> observers.

Hydrus was one of the twelve constellations established by the Dutch astronomer <a href="Petrus%20Plancius">Petrus Plancius</a> from the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers <a href="Pieter%20Dirkszoon%20Keyser">Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser</a> and <a href="Frederick%20de%20Houtman">Frederick de Houtman</a>, who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the "<a href="First%20Dutch%20Expedition%20to%20Indonesia">Eerste Schipvaart</a>", to the <a href="East%20Indies">East Indies</a>. It first appeared on a 35-cm (14 in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with <a href="Jodocus%20Hondius">Jodocus Hondius</a>. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in the German cartographer <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>'s "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>" of 1603. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue the same year under the Dutch name "De Waterslang", "The Water Snake", it representing a type of snake encountered on the expedition rather than a mythical creature. The French explorer and astronomer <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</a> called it "l’Hydre Mâle" on the 1756 version of his <a href="planisphere">planisphere</a> of the southern skies, distinguishing it from the feminine <a href="Hydra%20%28constellation%29">Hydra</a>. The French name was retained by <a href="Jean%20Nicolas%20Fortin">Jean Fortin</a> in 1776 for his "Atlas Céleste", while Lacaille <a href="Latin">Latin</a>ised the name to Hydrus for his revised "Coelum Australe Stelliferum" in 1763.

Irregular in shape, Hydrus is bordered by <a href="Mensa%20%28constellation%29">Mensa</a> to the southeast, <a href="Eridanus%20%28constellation%29">Eridanus</a> to the east, <a href="Horologium%20%28constellation%29">Horologium</a> and <a href="Reticulum">Reticulum</a> to the northeast, <a href="Phoenix%20%28constellation%29">Phoenix</a> to the north, <a href="Tucana">Tucana</a> to the northwest and west, and <a href="Octans">Octans</a> to the south; Lacaille had shortened Hydrus' tail to make space for this last constellation he had drawn up. Covering 243 square degrees and 0.589% of the night sky, it ranks 61st of the 88 constellations in size. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is 'Hyi'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 12 segments. In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between −57.85° and −82.06°. As one of the deep southern constellations, it remains below the horizon at latitudes north of the <a href="30th%20parallel%20north">30th parallel</a> in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, and is circumpolar at latitudes south of the <a href="50th%20parallel%20south">50th parallel</a> in the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>. Indeed, <a href="Herman%20Melville">Herman Melville</a> mentions it and <a href="Argo%20Navis">Argo Navis</a> in Moby Dick "beneath effulgent Antarctic Skies", highlighting his knowledge of the southern constellations from whaling voyages. A line drawn between the long axis of the <a href="Crux">Southern Cross</a> to <a href="Beta%20Hydri">Beta Hydri</a> and then extended 4.5 times will mark a point due south. Hydrus <a href="culmination">culminates</a> at midnight around 26 October.

Keyzer and de Houtman assigned fifteen stars to the constellation in their Malay and Madagascan vocabulary, with a star that would be later designated as <a href="Alpha%20Hydri">Alpha Hydri</a> marking the head, Gamma the chest and a number of stars that were later allocated to Tucana, Reticulum, Mensa and Horologium marking the body and tail. Lacaille charted and designated 20 stars with the <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s Alpha through to Tau in 1756. Of these, he used the designations Eta, Pi and Tau twice each, for three sets of two stars close together, and omitted Omicron and Xi. He assigned Rho to a star that subsequent astronomers were unable to find.

Beta Hydri, the brightest star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 2.8, lying 24 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s from Earth. It has about 104% of the <a href="Solar%20mass">mass of the Sun</a> and 181% of the Sun's radius, with more than three times the Sun's <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a>. The <a href="stellar%20spectrum">spectrum</a> of this star matches a <a href="stellar%20classification">stellar classification</a> of G2 IV, with the <a href="luminosity%20class">luminosity class</a> of 'IV' indicating this is a <a href="Subgiant">subgiant star</a>. As such, it is a slightly more <a href="stellar%20evolution">evolved</a> star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen fuel at its <a href="stellar%20structure">core</a> becoming exhausted. It is the nearest subgiant star to the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, this star bears some resemblance to what the Sun may look like in the far distant future, making it an object of interest to astronomers. It is also the closest bright star to the <a href="pole%20star%23Southern%20pole%20star%20%28South%20Star%29">south celestial pole</a>.

Located at the northern edge of the constellation and just southwest of <a href="Achernar">Achernar</a> is <a href="Alpha%20Hydri">Alpha Hydri</a>, a white sub-giant star of magnitude 2.9, situated 72 light-years from Earth. Of spectral type F0IV, it is beginning to cool and enlarge as it uses up its supply of hydrogen. It is twice as massive and 3.3 times as wide as our sun and 26 times more luminous. A line drawn between Alpha Hydri and <a href="Beta%20Centauri">Beta Centauri</a> is bisected by the south celestial pole.

In the southeastern corner of the constellation is <a href="Gamma%20Hydri">Gamma Hydri</a>, a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> of spectral type M2III located 214 light-years from Earth. It is a <a href="Semiregular%20variable%20star">semi-regular variable</a> star, pulsating between magnitudes 3.26 and 3.33. Observations over five years were not able to establish its <a href="wikt%3Aperiodicity">periodicity</a>. It is around 1.5 to 2 times as massive as our Sun, and has expanded to about 60 times the Sun's diameter. It shines with about 655 times the luminosity of the Sun. Located 3° northeast of Gamma is the <a href="VW%20Hydri">VW Hydri</a>, a <a href="dwarf%20nova">dwarf nova</a> of the SU Ursae Majoris type. It is a close <a href="Binary%20star">binary</a> system that consists of a <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a> and another star, the former drawing off matter from the latter into a bright <a href="accretion%20disk">accretion disk</a>. These systems are characterised by frequent eruptions and less frequent supereruptions. The former are smooth, while the latter exhibit short "superhumps" of heightened activity. One of the brightest dwarf novae in the sky, it has a baseline magnitude of 14.4 and can brighten to magnitude 8.4 during peak activity. <a href="BL%20Hydri">BL Hydri</a> is another close binary system composed of a low mass star and a strongly magnetic white dwarf. Known as a <a href="Polar%20%28cataclysmic%20variable%20star%29">polar</a> or AM Herculis variable, these produce <a href="Polarization%20%28waves%29">polarized</a> optical and <a href="infrared">infrared</a> emissions and intense soft and hard <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> emissions to the frequency of the white dwarf's <a href="rotation%20period">rotation period</a>—in this case 113.6 minutes.
There are two notable optical double stars in Hydrus. Pi Hydri, composed of <a href="Pi1%20Hydri">Pi Hydri</a> and <a href="Pi2%20Hydri">Pi Hydri</a>, is divisible in binoculars. Around 476 light-years distant, Pi is a red giant of spectral type M1III that varies between magnitudes 5.52 and 5.58. Pi is an orange giant of spectral type K2III and shining with a magnitude of 5.7, around 488 light-years from Earth.

Eta Hydri is the other optical double, composed of <a href="Eta1%20Hydri">Eta</a> and <a href="Eta2%20Hydri">Eta</a>. Eta is a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B9V that was suspected of being variable, and is located just over 700 light-years away. Eta has a magnitude of 4.7 and is a yellow giant star of spectral type G8.5III around 218 light-years distant, which has evolved off the main sequence and is expanding and cooling on its way to becoming a red giant. Calculations of its mass indicate it was most likely a white A-type main sequence star for most of its existence, around twice the mass of our Sun. A planet, <a href="Eta2%20Hydri%20b">Eta2 Hydri b</a>, greater than 6.5 times the mass of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> was discovered in 2005, orbiting around Eta every 711 days at a distance of 1.93 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s (AU).

Three other systems have been found to have planets, most notably the <a href="Solar%20analog%23Solar-type">Sun-like</a> star <a href="HD%2010180">HD 10180</a>, which has seven planets, plus possibly an additional two for a total of nine—as of 2012 more than any other system to date, including the Solar System. Lying around from the Earth, it has an apparent magnitude of 7.33.

<a href="HD%201237">GJ 3021</a> is a <a href="Solar%20analog">solar twin</a>—a star very like our own Sun—around 57 light-years distant with a spectral type G8V and magnitude of 6.7. It has a <a href="Giant%20planet">Jovian planet</a> companion (<a href="Gliese%203021%20b">GJ 3021 b</a>). Orbiting about 0.5 AU from its sun, it has a minimum mass 3.37 times that of Jupiter and a period of around 133 days. The system is a complex one as the faint star GJ 3021B orbits at a distance of 68 AU; it is a red dwarf of spectral type M4V.

<a href="HD%2020003">HD 20003</a> is a star of magnitude 8.37. It is a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G8V a little cooler and smaller than our Sun around 143 light-years away. It has two planets that are around 12 and 13.5 times as massive as the Earth with periods of just under 12 and 34 days respectively.

Hydrus contains only faint <a href="deep-sky%20object">deep-sky object</a>s. <a href="IC%201717">IC 1717</a> was a deep-sky object discovered by the Danish astronomer <a href="John%20Louis%20Emil%20Dreyer">John Louis Emil Dreyer</a> in the late 19th century. The object at the coordinate Dreyer observed is no longer there, and is now a mystery. It was very likely to have been a faint <a href="comet">comet</a>. <a href="PGC%206240">PGC 6240</a>, known as the White Rose Galaxy, is a giant <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a> surrounded by shells resembling rose petals, located around 345 million light years from the Solar System. Unusually, it has cohorts of globular clusters of three distinct ages suggesting bouts of post-starburst formation following a merger with another galaxy. The constellation also contains a spiral galaxy, <a href="NGC%201511">NGC 1511</a>, which lies edge on to observers on Earth and is readily viewed in amateur telescopes.

Located mostly in <a href="Dorado">Dorado</a>, the <a href="Large%20Magellanic%20Cloud">Large Magellanic Cloud</a> extends into Hydrus. The globular cluster <a href="NGC%201466">NGC 1466</a> is an outlying component of the galaxy, and contains many <a href="RR%20Lyrae%20variable">RR Lyrae-type variable stars</a>. It has a magnitude of 11.59 and is thought to be over 12 billion years old. Two stars, HD 24188 of magnitude 6.3 and HD 24115 of magnitude 9.0, lie nearby in its foreground. <a href="NGC%20602">NGC 602</a> is composed of an <a href="emission%20nebula">emission nebula</a> and a young, bright <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> of stars that is an outlying component on the eastern edge of the <a href="Small%20Magellanic%20Cloud">Small Magellanic Cloud</a>, a <a href="satellite%20galaxy">satellite galaxy</a> to the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>. Most of the cloud is located in the neighbouring constellation Tucana.

Henry I of England

Henry I (c. 1068 – 1 December 1135), also known as Henry Beauclerc, was <a href="King%20of%20England">King of England</a> from 1100 to his death in 1135. Henry was the fourth son of <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a> and was educated in <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and the <a href="liberal%20arts">liberal arts</a>. On William's death in 1087, Henry's elder brothers <a href="Robert%20Curthose">Robert Curthose</a> and <a href="William%20Rufus">William Rufus</a> inherited <a href="Duchy%20of%20Normandy">Normandy</a> and England, respectively, but Henry was left landless. Henry purchased the <a href="Cotentin">County of Cotentin</a> in western Normandy from Robert, but William and Robert deposed him in 1091. Henry gradually rebuilt his power base in the Cotentin and allied himself with William against Robert. Henry was present when William died in a hunting accident in 1100, and he seized the English throne, promising at his coronation to correct many of William's less popular policies. Henry married <a href="Matilda%20of%20Scotland">Matilda of Scotland</a> but continued to have a large number of mistresses by whom he had many illegitimate children.

Robert, who invaded in 1101, disputed Henry's control of England; this military campaign ended in a negotiated settlement that confirmed Henry as king. The peace was short-lived, and Henry invaded the Duchy of Normandy in 1105 and 1106, finally defeating Robert at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tinchebray">Battle of Tinchebray</a>. Henry kept Robert imprisoned for the rest of his life. Henry's control of Normandy was challenged by <a href="Louis%20VI%20of%20France">Louis VI of France</a>, <a href="Baldwin%20VII%20of%20Flanders">Baldwin VII of Flanders</a> and <a href="Fulk%20V%20of%20Anjou">Fulk V of Anjou</a>, who promoted the rival claims of Robert's son, <a href="William%20Clito">William Clito</a>, and supported a major rebellion in the Duchy between 1116 and 1119. Following Henry's victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Br%C3%A9mule">Battle of Brémule</a>, a favourable peace settlement was agreed with Louis in 1120.

Considered by contemporaries to be a harsh but effective ruler, Henry skilfully manipulated the barons in England and Normandy. In England, he drew on the existing <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> system of justice, local government and taxation, but also strengthened it with additional institutions, including the royal <a href="exchequer">exchequer</a> and itinerant <a href="judge">justices</a>. Normandy was also governed through a growing system of justices and an exchequer. Many of the officials who ran Henry's system were "new men" of obscure backgrounds rather than from families of high status, who rose through the ranks as administrators. Henry encouraged <a href="Gregorian%20Reform">ecclesiastical reform</a>, but became embroiled in a serious dispute in 1101 with Archbishop <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm of Canterbury</a>, which was resolved through a compromise solution in 1105. He supported the <a href="Cluniac">Cluniac</a> order and played a major role in the selection of the senior clergy in England and Normandy.

Henry's only legitimate son and heir, <a href="William%20Adelin">William Adelin</a>, drowned in the "<a href="White%20Ship">White Ship</a>" disaster of 1120, throwing the royal succession into doubt. Henry took a second wife, <a href="Adeliza%20of%20Louvain">Adeliza of Louvain</a>, in the hope of having another son, but their marriage was childless. In response to this, Henry declared his daughter, <a href="Empress%20Matilda">Empress Matilda</a>, his heir and married her to <a href="Geoffrey%20of%20Anjou">Geoffrey of Anjou</a>. The relationship between Henry and the couple became strained, and fighting broke out along the border with Anjou. Henry died on 1 December 1135 after a week of illness. Despite his plans for Matilda, the King was succeeded by his nephew, <a href="Stephen%20of%20Blois">Stephen of Blois</a>, resulting in a period of civil war known as <a href="the%20Anarchy">the Anarchy</a>.
Henry was probably born in England in 1068, in either the summer or the last weeks of the year, possibly in the town of <a href="Selby">Selby</a> in <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>. His father was <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a>, the <a href="Duke%20of%20Normandy">Duke of Normandy</a> who had <a href="Norman%20invasion%20of%20England">invaded England in 1066</a> to become the <a href="King%20of%20England">King of England</a>, establishing lands stretching into <a href="Wales">Wales</a>. The invasion had created an Anglo-Norman elite, many with estates spread across both sides of the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>. These Anglo-Norman barons typically had close links to the <a href="kingdom%20of%20France">kingdom of France</a>, which was then a loose collection of counties and smaller polities, under only the minimal control of the king. Henry's mother, <a href="Matilda%20of%20Flanders">Matilda of Flanders</a>, was the granddaughter of <a href="Robert%20II%20of%20France">Robert II of France</a>, and she probably named Henry after her uncle, King <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20France">Henry I of France</a>.

Henry was the youngest of William and Matilda's four sons. Physically he resembled his older brothers <a href="Robert%20Curthose">Robert Curthose</a>, <a href="Richard%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bernay">Richard</a> and <a href="William%20Rufus">William Rufus</a>, being, as historian David Carpenter describes, "short, stocky and barrel-chested," with black hair. As a result of their age differences and Richard's early death, Henry would have probably seen relatively little of his older brothers. He probably knew his sister <a href="Adela%20of%20Normandy">Adela</a> well, as the two were close in age. There is little documentary evidence for his early years; historians <a href="C.%20Warren%20Hollister">Warren Hollister</a> and Kathleen Thompson suggest he was brought up predominantly in England, while <a href="Judith%20Green%20%28historian%29">Judith Green</a> argues he was initially brought up in the Duchy. He was probably educated by the Church, possibly by <a href="Osmund%20%28bishop%20of%20Salisbury%29">Bishop Osmund</a>, the King's <a href="chancellor">chancellor</a>, at <a href="Salisbury%20Cathedral">Salisbury Cathedral</a>; it is uncertain if this indicated an intent by his parents for Henry to become a member of the clergy. It is also uncertain how far Henry's education extended, but he was probably able to read <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and had some background in the <a href="liberal%20arts">liberal arts</a>. He was given military training by an instructor called Robert Achard, and Henry was knighted by his father on 24 May 1086.

In 1087, William was fatally injured during a campaign in the <a href="Vexin">Vexin</a>. Henry joined his dying father near <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a> in September, where the King partitioned his possessions among his sons. The rules of succession in western Europe at the time were uncertain; in some parts of France, <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a>, in which the eldest son would inherit a title, was growing in popularity. In other parts of Europe, including Normandy and England, the tradition was for lands to be divided up, with the eldest son taking patrimonial lands – usually considered to be the most valuable – and younger sons given smaller, or more recently acquired, partitions or estates.

In dividing his lands, William appears to have followed the Norman tradition, distinguishing between Normandy, which he had inherited, and England, which he had acquired through war. William's second son, Richard, had died in a hunting accident, leaving Henry and his two brothers to inherit William's estate. Robert, the eldest, despite being in armed rebellion against his father at the time of his death, received Normandy. England was given to William Rufus, who was in favour with the dying king. Henry was given a large sum of money, usually reported as £5,000, with the expectation that he would also be given his mother's modest set of lands in <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a> and <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>. William's funeral at <a href="Caen">Caen</a> was marred by angry complaints from a local man, and Henry may have been responsible for resolving the dispute by buying off the protester with silver.

Robert returned to Normandy, expecting to have been given both the Duchy and England, to find that William Rufus had crossed the Channel and been crowned king. The two brothers disagreed fundamentally over the inheritance, and Robert soon began to plan an invasion of England to seize the kingdom, helped by a rebellion by some of the leading nobles against William Rufus. Henry remained in Normandy and took up a role within Robert's court, possibly either because he was unwilling to side openly with William Rufus, or because Robert might have taken the opportunity to confiscate Henry's inherited money if he had tried to leave. William Rufus sequestered Henry's new estates in England, leaving Henry landless.

In 1088, Robert's plans for the invasion of England began to falter, and he turned to Henry, proposing that his brother lend him some of his inheritance, which Henry refused. Henry and Robert then came to an alternative arrangement, in which Robert would make Henry the count of western Normandy, in exchange for £3,000. Henry's lands were a new countship based around a delegation of the ducal authority in the <a href="Cotentin">Cotentin</a>, but it extended across the <a href="Avranchin">Avranchin</a>, with control over the bishoprics of both. This also gave Henry influence over two major Norman leaders, <a href="Hugh%20d%27Avranches%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Chester">Hugh d'Avranches</a> and <a href="Richard%20de%20Redvers">Richard de Redvers</a>, and the abbey of <a href="Mont%20Saint-Michel">Mont Saint-Michel</a>, whose lands spread out further across the Duchy. Robert's invasion force failed to leave Normandy, leaving William Rufus secure in England.

Henry quickly established himself as count, building up a network of followers from western Normandy and eastern Brittany, whom historian <a href="John%20Le%20Patourel">John Le Patourel</a> has characterised as "Henry's gang". His early supporters included Roger of Mandeville, Richard of Redvers, <a href="Richard%20d%27Avranches%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Chester">Richard d'Avranches</a> and <a href="Robert%20Fitzhamon">Robert Fitzhamon</a>, along with the churchman <a href="Roger%20of%20Salisbury">Roger of Salisbury</a>. Robert attempted to go back on his deal with Henry and re-appropriate the county, but Henry's grip was already sufficiently firm to prevent this. Robert's rule of the Duchy was chaotic, and parts of Henry's lands became almost independent of central control from Rouen.

During this period, neither William nor Robert seems to have trusted Henry. Waiting until the rebellion against William Rufus was safely over, Henry returned to England in July 1088. He met with the King but was unable to persuade him to grant him their mother's estates, and travelled back to Normandy in the autumn. While he had been away, however, <a href="Odo%2C%20Earl%20of%20Kent">Odo</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Bayeux">Bishop of Bayeux</a>, who regarded Henry as a potential competitor, had convinced Robert that Henry was conspiring against the duke with William Rufus. On landing, Odo seized Henry and imprisoned him in <a href="Neuilly-la-For%C3%AAt">Neuilly-la-Forêt</a>, and Robert took back the county of the Cotentin. Henry was held there over the winter, but in the spring of 1089 the senior elements of the Normandy nobility prevailed upon Robert to release him.

Although no longer formally the Count of Cotentin, Henry continued to control the west of Normandy. The struggle between Henry's brothers continued. William Rufus continued to put down resistance to his rule in England, but began to build a number of alliances against Robert with barons in Normandy and neighbouring Ponthieu. Robert allied himself with <a href="Philip%20I%20of%20France">Philip I of France</a>. In late 1090 William Rufus encouraged Conan Pilatus, a powerful burgher in Rouen, to rebel against Robert; Conan was supported by most of Rouen and made appeals to the neighbouring ducal garrisons to switch allegiance as well.

Robert issued an appeal for help to his barons, and Henry was the first to arrive in Rouen in November. Violence broke out, leading to savage, confused street fighting as both sides attempted to take control of the city. Robert and Henry left the castle to join the battle, but Robert then retreated, leaving Henry to continue the fighting. The battle turned in favour of the ducal forces and Henry took Conan prisoner. Henry was angry that Conan had turned against his feudal lord. He had him taken to the top of Rouen Castle and then, despite Conan's offers to pay a huge ransom, threw him off the top of the castle to his death. Contemporaries considered Henry to have acted appropriately in making an example of Conan, and Henry became famous for his exploits in the battle.

In the aftermath, Robert forced Henry to leave Rouen, probably because Henry's role in the fighting had been more prominent than his own, and possibly because Henry had asked to be formally reinstated as the count of the Cotentin. In early 1091, William Rufus invaded Normandy with a sufficiently large army to bring Robert to the negotiating table. The two brothers signed a treaty at Rouen, granting William Rufus a range of lands and castles in Normandy. In return, William Rufus promised to support Robert's attempts to regain control of the neighbouring county of Maine, once under Norman control, and help in regaining control over the Duchy, including Henry's lands. They nominated each other as heirs to England and Normandy, excluding Henry from any succession while either one of them lived.

War now broke out between Henry and his brothers. Henry mobilised a mercenary army in the west of Normandy, but as William Rufus and Robert's forces advanced, his network of baronial support melted away. Henry focused his remaining forces at <a href="Mont%20Saint-Michel">Mont Saint-Michel</a>, where he was besieged, probably in March 1091. The site was easy to defend, but lacked fresh water. The chronicler <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> suggested that when Henry's water ran short, Robert allowed his brother fresh supplies, leading to remonstrations between Robert and William Rufus. The events of the final days of the siege are unclear: the besiegers had begun to argue about the future strategy for the campaign, but Henry then abandoned Mont Saint-Michel, probably as part of a negotiated surrender. He left for Brittany and crossed over into France.

Henry's next steps are not well documented; one chronicler, <a href="Orderic%20Vitalis">Orderic Vitalis</a>, suggests that he travelled in the French Vexin, along the Normandy border, for over a year with a small band of followers. By the end of the year, Robert and William Rufus had fallen out once again, and the Treaty of Rouen had been abandoned. In 1092, Henry and his followers seized the Normandy town of <a href="Domfront%2C%20Orne">Domfront</a>. Domfront had previously been controlled by <a href="Robert%20of%20Bell%C3%AAme%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Shrewsbury">Robert of Bellême</a>, but the inhabitants disliked his rule and invited Henry to take over the town, which he did in a bloodless coup. Over the next two years, Henry re-established his network of supporters across western Normandy, forming what Judith Green terms a "court in waiting". By 1094, he was allocating lands and castles to his followers as if he were the Duke of Normandy. William Rufus began to support Henry with money, encouraging his campaign against Robert, and Henry used some of this to construct a <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Domfront">substantial castle</a> at Domfront.

William Rufus crossed into Normandy to take the war to Robert in 1094, and when progress stalled, called upon Henry for assistance. Henry responded, but travelled to London instead of joining the main campaign further east in Normandy, possibly at the request of the King, who in any event abandoned the campaign and returned to England. Over the next few years, Henry appears to have strengthened his power base in western Normandy, visiting England occasionally to attend at William Rufus's court. In 1095 <a href="Pope%20Urban%20II">Pope Urban II</a> called the <a href="First%20Crusade">First Crusade</a>, encouraging knights from across Europe to join. Robert joined the Crusade, borrowing money from William Rufus to do so, and granting the King temporary custody of his part of the Duchy in exchange. The King appeared confident of regaining the remainder of Normandy from Robert, and Henry appeared ever closer to William Rufus, the pair campaigning together in the Norman Vexin between 1097 and 1098.

On the afternoon of 2 August 1100, the King had gone hunting in the <a href="New%20Forest">New Forest</a>, accompanied by a team of huntsmen and a number of the Norman nobility, including Henry. An arrow, possibly shot by the baron Walter Tirel, hit and killed William Rufus. Numerous conspiracy theories have been put forward suggesting that the King was killed deliberately; most modern historians reject these, as hunting was a risky activity, and such accidents were common. Chaos broke out, and Tirel fled the scene for France, either because he had shot the fatal arrow, or because he had been incorrectly accused and feared that he would be made a scapegoat for the King's death.

Henry rode to Winchester, where an argument ensued as to who now had the best claim to the throne. William of Breteuil championed the rights of Robert, who was still abroad, returning from the Crusade, and to whom Henry and the barons had given <a href="Homage%20%28feudal%29">homage</a> in previous years. Henry argued that, unlike Robert, he had been born to a reigning king and queen, thereby giving him a claim under the right of <a href="porphyrogeniture">porphyrogeniture</a>. Tempers flared, but Henry, supported by Henry de Beaumont and Robert of Meulan, held sway and persuaded the barons to follow him. He occupied <a href="Winchester%20Castle">Winchester Castle</a> and seized the royal treasury.

Henry was hastily crowned king in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> on 5 August by <a href="Maurice%20%28bishop%20of%20London%29">Maurice</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>, as <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, had been exiled by William Rufus, and <a href="Thomas%20of%20Bayeux">Thomas</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>, was in the north of England at <a href="Ripon">Ripon</a>. In accordance with English tradition and in a bid to legitimise his rule, Henry issued a <a href="Charter%20of%20Liberties">coronation charter</a> laying out various commitments. The new king presented himself as having restored order to a trouble-torn country. He announced that he would abandon William Rufus's policies towards the Church, which had been seen as oppressive by the clergy; he promised to prevent royal abuses of the barons' property rights, and assured a return to the gentler customs of <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>; he asserted that he would "establish a firm peace" across England and ordered "that this peace shall henceforth be kept".

In addition to his existing circle of supporters, many of whom were richly rewarded with new lands, Henry quickly co-opted many of the existing administration into his new royal household. <a href="William%20Giffard">William Giffard</a>, William Rufus's chancellor, was made the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>, and the prominent sheriffs <a href="Urse%20d%27Abetot">Urse d'Abetot</a>, <a href="Haimo%20%28dapifer%29">Haimo Dapifer</a> and Robert Fitzhamon continued to play a senior role in government. By contrast, the unpopular <a href="Ranulf%20Flambard">Ranulf Flambard</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a> and a key member of the previous regime, was imprisoned in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> and charged with corruption. The late king had left many church positions unfilled, and Henry set about nominating candidates to these, in an effort to build further support for his new government. The appointments needed to be consecrated, and Henry wrote to Anselm, apologising for having been crowned while the Archbishop was still in France and asking him to return at once.

On 11 November 1100 Henry married <a href="Matilda%20of%20Scotland">Matilda</a>, the daughter of <a href="Malcolm%20III%20of%20Scotland">Malcolm III of Scotland</a>. Henry was now around 31 years old, but late marriages for noblemen were not unusual in the 11th century. The pair had probably first met earlier the previous decade, possibly being introduced through Bishop Osmund of Salisbury. Historian Warren Hollister argues that Henry and Matilda were emotionally close, but their union was also certainly politically motivated. Matilda had originally been named Edith, an Anglo-Saxon name, and was a member of the West Saxon royal family, being the niece of <a href="Edgar%20the%20%C3%86theling">Edgar the Ætheling</a>, the great-granddaughter of <a href="Edmund%20Ironside">Edmund Ironside</a> and a descendant of <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>. For Henry, marrying Matilda gave his reign increased legitimacy, and for Matilda, an ambitious woman, it was an opportunity for high status and power in England.

Matilda had been educated in a sequence of convents, however, and may well have taken the vows to formally become a nun, which formed an obstacle to the marriage progressing. She did not wish to be a nun and appealed to Anselm for permission to marry Henry, and the Archbishop established a council at <a href="Lambeth%20Palace">Lambeth Palace</a> to judge the issue. Despite some dissenting voices, the council concluded that although Matilda had lived in a convent, she had not actually become a nun and was therefore free to marry, a judgement that Anselm then affirmed, allowing the marriage to proceed. Matilda proved an effective queen for Henry, acting as a regent in England on occasion, addressing and presiding over councils, and extensively supporting the arts. The couple soon had two children, <a href="Empress%20Matilda">Matilda</a>, born in 1102, and <a href="William%20Adelin">William Adelin</a>, born in 1103; it is possible that they also had a second son, Richard, who died young. Following the birth of these children, Matilda preferred to remain based in Westminster while Henry travelled across England and Normandy, either for religious reasons or because she enjoyed being involved in the machinery of royal governance.

Henry had a considerable sexual appetite and enjoyed a substantial number of sexual partners, resulting in a large number of illegitimate children, at least nine sons and 13 daughters, many of whom he appears to have recognised and supported. It was normal for unmarried Anglo-Norman noblemen to have sexual relations with prostitutes and local women, and kings were also expected to have mistresses. Some of these relationships occurred before Henry was married, but many others took place after his marriage to Matilda. Henry had a wide range of mistresses from a range of backgrounds, and the relationships appear to have been conducted relatively openly. He may have chosen some of his noble mistresses for political purposes, but the evidence to support this theory is limited.

By early 1101, Henry's new regime was established and functioning, but many of the Anglo-Norman elite still supported Robert, or would be prepared to switch sides if Henry's elder brother appeared likely to gain power in England. In February, Flambard escaped from the Tower of London and crossed the Channel to Normandy, where he injected fresh direction and energy to Robert's attempts to mobilise an invasion force. By July, Robert had formed an army and a fleet, ready to move against Henry in England. Raising the stakes in the conflict, Henry seized Flambard's lands and, with the support of Anselm, Flambard was removed from his position as bishop. Henry held court in April and June, where the nobility renewed their oaths of allegiance to him, but their support still appeared partial and shaky.

With the invasion imminent, Henry mobilised his forces and fleet outside <a href="Pevensey">Pevensey</a>, close to Robert's anticipated landing site, training some of them personally in how to counter cavalry charges. Despite English levies and knights owing military service to the Church arriving in considerable numbers, many of his barons did not appear. Anselm intervened with some of the doubters, emphasising the religious importance of their loyalty to Henry. Robert unexpectedly landed further up the coast at <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> on 20 July with a modest force of a few hundred men, but these were quickly joined by many of the barons in England. However, instead of marching into nearby Winchester and seizing Henry's treasury, Robert paused, giving Henry time to march west and intercept the invasion force.

The two armies met at <a href="Alton%2C%20Hampshire">Alton</a> where peace negotiations began, possibly initiated by either Henry or Robert, and probably supported by Flambard. The brothers then agreed to the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Alton">Treaty of Alton</a>, under which Robert released Henry from his oath of homage and recognised him as king; Henry renounced his claims on western Normandy, except for Domfront, and agreed to pay Robert £2,000 a year for life; if either brother died without a male heir, the other would inherit his lands; the barons whose lands had been seized by either the King or the Duke for supporting his rival would have them returned, and Flambard would be reinstated as bishop; the two brothers would campaign together to defend their territories in Normandy. Robert remained in England for a few months more with Henry before returning to Normandy.

Despite the treaty, Henry set about inflicting severe penalties on the barons who had stood against him during the invasion. <a href="William%20de%20Warenne%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Surrey">William de Warenne</a>, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Surrey">Earl of Surrey</a>, was accused of fresh crimes, which were not covered by the Alton amnesty, and was banished from England. In 1102 Henry then turned against Robert of Bellême and his brothers, the most powerful of the barons, accusing him of 45 different offences. Robert escaped and took up arms against Henry. Henry besieged Robert's castles at <a href="Arundel%20Castle">Arundel</a>, <a href="Tickhill%20Castle">Tickhill</a> and <a href="Shrewsbury%20Castle">Shrewsbury</a>, pushing down into the south-west to attack <a href="Bridgnorth">Bridgnorth</a>. His power base in England broken, Robert accepted Henry's offer of banishment and left the country for Normandy.

Henry's network of allies in Normandy became stronger during 1103. Henry arranged the marriages of his illegitimate daughters, <a href="Juliane%20de%20Fontevrault">Juliane</a> and <a href="Matilda%20FitzRoy%2C%20Countess%20of%20Perche">Matilda</a>, to Eustace of Breteuil and <a href="Rotrou%20III%2C%20Count%20of%20Perche">Rotrou III, Count of Perche</a>, respectively, the latter union securing the Norman border. Henry attempted to win over other members of the Norman nobility and gave other English estates and lucrative offers to key Norman lords. Duke Robert continued to fight Robert of Bellême, but the Duke's position worsened, until by 1104, he had to ally himself formally with Bellême to survive. Arguing that Duke Robert had broken the terms of their treaty, Henry crossed over the Channel to Domfront, where he met with senior barons from across Normandy, eager to ally themselves with the King. Henry confronted his brother and accused him of siding with his enemies, before returning to England.

Normandy continued to disintegrate into chaos. In 1105, Henry sent his friend Robert Fitzhamon and a force of knights into the Duchy, apparently to provoke a confrontation with Duke Robert. Fitzhamon was captured, and Henry used this as an excuse to invade, promising to restore peace and order. Henry had the support of most of the neighbouring counts around Normandy's borders, and King Philip of France was persuaded to remain neutral. Henry occupied western Normandy, and advanced east on Bayeux, where Fitzhamon was held. The city refused to surrender, and Henry besieged it, burning it to the ground. Terrified of meeting the same fate, the town of Caen switched sides and surrendered, allowing Henry to advance on <a href="Falaise%2C%20Calvados">Falaise</a>, which he took with some casualties. Henry's campaign stalled, and the King instead began peace discussions with Robert. The negotiations were inconclusive and the fighting dragged on until Christmas, when Henry returned to England.

Henry invaded again in July 1106, hoping to provoke a decisive battle. After some initial tactical successes, he turned south-west towards the castle of <a href="Tinchebray">Tinchebray</a>. He besieged the castle and Duke Robert, supported by Robert of Bellême, advanced from Falaise to relieve it. After attempts at negotiation failed, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tinchebray">Battle of Tinchebray</a> took place, probably on 28 September. The battle lasted around an hour, and began with a charge by Duke Robert's cavalry; the infantry and dismounted knights of both sides then joined the battle. Henry's reserves, led by <a href="Elias%20I%2C%20Count%20of%20Maine">Elias I, Count of Maine</a>, and <a href="Alan%20IV%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany">Alan IV, Duke of Brittany</a>, attacked the enemy's flanks, routing first Bellême's troops and then the bulk of the ducal forces. Duke Robert was taken prisoner, but Bellême escaped.

Henry mopped up the remaining resistance in Normandy, and Robert ordered his last garrisons to surrender. Reaching Rouen, Henry reaffirmed the laws and customs of Normandy and took homage from the leading barons and citizens. The lesser prisoners taken at Tinchebray were released, but Robert and several other leading nobles were imprisoned indefinitely. Henry's nephew, Robert's son <a href="William%20Clito">William Clito</a>, was only three years old and was released to the care of <a href="Helias%20of%20Saint-Saens">Helias of Saint-Saens</a>, a Norman baron. Henry reconciled himself with Robert of Bellême, who gave up the ducal lands he had seized and rejoined the royal court. Henry had no way of legally removing the Duchy from his brother Robert, and initially Henry avoided using the title "duke" at all, emphasising that, as the King of England, he was only acting as the guardian of the troubled Duchy.

Henry inherited the kingdom of England from William Rufus, giving him a claim of <a href="suzerainty">suzerainty</a> over Wales and Scotland, and acquired the Duchy of Normandy, a complex entity with troubled borders. The borders between England and Scotland were still uncertain during Henry's reign, with Anglo-Norman influence pushing northwards through <a href="Cumbria">Cumbria</a>, but Henry's relationship with King <a href="David%20I%20of%20Scotland">David I of Scotland</a> was generally good, partially due to Henry's marriage to his sister. In Wales, Henry used his power to coerce and charm the indigenous Welsh princes, while Norman <a href="Marcher%20Lord">Marcher Lord</a>s pushed across the valleys of South Wales. Normandy was controlled via various interlocking networks of ducal, ecclesiastical and family contacts, backed by a growing string of important ducal castles along the borders. Alliances and relationships with neighbouring counties along the Norman border were particularly important to maintaining the stability of the Duchy.

Henry ruled through the various barons and lords in England and Normandy, whom he manipulated skilfully for political effect. Political friendships, termed "amicitia" in Latin, were important during the 12th century, and Henry maintained a wide range of these, mediating between his friends in various factions across his realm when necessary, and rewarding those who were loyal to him. Henry also had a reputation for punishing those barons who stood against him, and he maintained an effective network of informers and spies who reported to him on events. Henry was a harsh, firm ruler, but not excessively so by the standards of the day. Over time, he increased the degree of his control over the barons, removing his enemies and bolstering his friends until the "reconstructed baronage", as historian Warren Hollister describes it, was predominantly loyal and dependent on the King.

Henry's itinerant royal court comprised various parts. At the heart was Henry's domestic household, called the "domus"; a wider grouping was termed the "<a href="familia%20regis">familia regis</a>", and formal gatherings of the court were termed "<a href="Curia%20regis">curia</a>". The "domus" was divided into several parts. The chapel, headed by the chancellor, looked after the royal documents, the chamber dealt with financial affairs and the master-marshal was responsible for travel and accommodation. The "familia regis" included Henry's mounted household troops, up to several hundred strong, who came from a wider range of social backgrounds, and could be deployed across England and Normandy as required. Initially Henry continued his father's practice of regular crown-wearing ceremonies at his "curia", but they became less frequent as the years passed. Henry's court was grand and ostentatious, financing the construction of large new buildings and castles with a range of precious gifts on display, including the King's private menagerie of exotic animals, which he kept at <a href="Woodstock%20Palace">Woodstock Palace</a>. Despite being a lively community, Henry's court was more tightly controlled than those of previous kings. Strict rules controlled personal behaviour and prohibited members of the court from pillaging neighbouring villages, as had been the norm under William Rufus.

Henry was responsible for a substantial expansion of the royal justice system. In England, Henry drew on the existing <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20law">Anglo-Saxon system</a> of justice, local government and <a href="Taxation%20in%20medieval%20England%23Anglo-Saxon%20England%20%28597%E2%80%931066%29">taxes</a>, but strengthened it with additional central governmental institutions. Roger of Salisbury began to develop the royal exchequer after 1110, using it to collect and audit revenues from the King's sheriffs in the shires. Itinerant justices began to emerge under Henry, travelling around the country managing <a href="Eyre%20%28legal%20term%29">eyre courts</a>, and many more laws were formally recorded. Henry gathered increasing revenue from the expansion of royal justice, both from fines and from fees. The first <a href="Pipe%20Roll">Pipe Roll</a> that is known to have survived dates from 1130, recording royal expenditures. Henry reformed the coinage in 1107, 1108 and in 1125, inflicting harsh corporal punishments to English coiners who had been found guilty of debasing the currency. In Normandy, Henry restored law and order after 1106, operating through a body of Norman justices and an exchequer system similar to that in England. Norman institutions grew in scale and scope under Henry, although less quickly than in England. Many of the officials that ran Henry's system were termed "new men", relatively low-born individuals who rose through the ranks as administrators, managing justice or the royal revenues.

Henry's ability to govern was intimately bound up with the Church, which formed the key to the administration of both England and Normandy, and this relationship changed considerably over the course of his reign. William the Conqueror had reformed the English Church with the support of his Archbishop of Canterbury, <a href="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</a>, who became a close colleague and advisor to the King. Under William Rufus this arrangement had collapsed, the King and Archbishop Anselm had become estranged and Anselm had gone into exile. Henry also believed in Church reform, but on taking power in England he became embroiled in the <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury%23Conflicts%20with%20King%20Henry%20I">investiture controversy</a>.

The argument concerned who should invest a new bishop with his staff and ring: traditionally, this had been carried out by the king in a symbolic demonstration of royal power, but Pope Urban II had condemned this practice in 1099, arguing that only the papacy could carry out this task, and declaring that the clergy should not give homage to their local temporal rulers. Anselm returned to England from exile in 1100 having heard Urban's pronouncement, and informed Henry that he would be complying with the Pope's wishes. Henry was in a difficult position. On one hand, the symbolism and homage was important to him; on the other hand, he needed Anselm's support in his struggle with his brother Duke Robert.

Anselm stuck firmly to the letter of the papal decree, despite Henry's attempts to persuade him to give way in return for a vague assurance of a future royal compromise. Matters escalated, with Anselm going back into exile and Henry confiscating the revenues of his estates. Anselm threatened excommunication, and in July 1105 the two men finally negotiated a solution. A distinction was drawn between the secular and ecclesiastical powers of the prelates, under which Henry gave up his right to invest his clergy, but retained the custom of requiring them to come and do homage for the <a href="temporalities">temporalities</a>, the landed properties they held in England. Despite this argument, the pair worked closely together, combining to deal with Duke Robert's invasion of 1101, for example, and holding major reforming councils in 1102 and 1108.

A long-running dispute between the Archbishops of Canterbury and York flared up under Anselm's successor, <a href="Ralph%20d%27Escures">Ralph d'Escures</a>. Canterbury, traditionally the senior of the two establishments, had long argued that the Archbishop of York should formally promise to obey their Archbishop, but York argued that the two episcopates were independent within the English Church and that no such promise was necessary. Henry supported the primacy of Canterbury, to ensure that England remained under a single ecclesiastical administration, but the Pope preferred the case of York. The matter was complicated by Henry's personal friendship with <a href="Thurstan">Thurstan</a>, the Archbishop of York, and the King's desire that the case should not end up in a papal court, beyond royal control. Henry badly needed the support of the Papacy in his struggle with Louis of France, however, and therefore allowed Thurstan to attend the Council of Rheims in 1119, where Thurstan was then consecrated by the Pope with no mention of any duty towards Canterbury. Henry believed that this went against assurances Thurstan had previously made and exiled him from England until the King and Archbishop came to a negotiated solution the following year.

Even after the investiture dispute, the King continued to play a major role in the selection of new English and Norman bishops and archbishops. Henry appointed many of his officials to bishoprics and, as historian Martin Brett suggests, "some of his officers could look forward to a mitre with all but absolute confidence". Henry's chancellors, and those of his queens, became bishops of Durham, Hereford, London, Lincoln, Winchester and Salisbury. Henry increasingly drew on a wider range of these bishops as advisors – particularly Roger of Salisbury – breaking with the earlier tradition of relying primarily on the Archbishop of Canterbury. The result was a cohesive body of administrators through which Henry could exercise careful influence, holding general councils to discuss key matters of policy. This stability shifted slightly after 1125, when Henry began to inject a wider range of candidates into the senior positions of the Church, often with more reformist views, and the impact of this generation would be felt in the years after Henry's death.

Like other rulers of the period, Henry donated to the Church and patronised various religious communities, but contemporary chroniclers did not consider him an unusually pious king. His personal beliefs and piety may, however, have developed during the course of his life. Henry had always taken an interest in religion, but in his later years he may have become much more concerned about spiritual affairs. If so, the major shifts in his thinking would appear to have occurred after 1120, when his son William Adelin died, and 1129, when his daughter's marriage teetered on the verge of collapse.

As a proponent of religious reform, Henry gave extensively to reformist groups within the Church. He was a keen supporter of the <a href="Cluniac%20order">Cluniac order</a>, probably for intellectual reasons. He donated money to the abbey at Cluny itself, and after 1120 gave generously to <a href="Reading%20Abbey">Reading Abbey</a>, a Cluniac establishment. Construction on Reading began in 1121, and Henry endowed it with rich lands and extensive privileges, making it a symbol of his dynastic lines. He also focused effort on promoting the conversion of communities of clerks into Augustinian canons, the foundation of <a href="leper%20hospital">leper hospital</a>s, expanding the provision of nunneries, and the charismatic orders of the <a href="Congregation%20of%20Savigny">Savigniacs</a> and <a href="Tironensian%20Order">Tironensians</a>. He was an avid collector of relics, sending an embassy to Constantinople in 1118 to collect Byzantine items, some of which were donated to Reading Abbey.

Normandy faced an increased threat from France, Anjou and Flanders after 1108. <a href="Louis%20VI%20of%20France">Louis VI</a> succeeded to the French throne in 1108 and began to reassert central royal power. Louis demanded Henry give homage to him and that two disputed castles along the Normandy border be placed into the control of neutral castellans. Henry refused, and Louis responded by mobilising an army. After some arguments, the two kings negotiated a truce and retreated without fighting, leaving the underlying issues unresolved. <a href="Fulk%2C%20King%20of%20Jerusalem">Fulk V</a> assumed power in Anjou in 1109 and began to rebuild Angevin authority. Fulk also inherited the county of Maine, but refused to recognise Henry as his feudal lord and instead allied himself with Louis. Robert II of Flanders also briefly joined the alliance, before his death in 1111.

In 1108, Henry betrothed his six-year-old daughter, Matilda, to <a href="Henry%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry V</a>, the future <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>. For King Henry, this was a prestigious match; for Henry V, it was an opportunity to restore his financial situation and fund an expedition to Italy, as he received a dowry of £6,666 from England and Normandy. Raising this money proved challenging, and required the implementation of a special "aid", or tax, in England. Matilda was crowned <a href="German%20queen">German queen</a> in 1110.

Henry responded to the French and Angevin threat by expanding his own network of supporters beyond the Norman borders. Some Norman barons deemed unreliable were arrested or dispossessed, and Henry used their forfeited estates to bribe his potential allies in the neighbouring territories, in particular Maine. Around 1110, Henry attempted to arrest the young William Clito, but William's mentors moved him to the safety of Flanders before he could be taken. At about this time, Henry probably began to style himself as the duke of Normandy. Robert of Bellême turned against Henry once again, and when he appeared at Henry's court in 1112 in a new role as a French ambassador, he was arrested and imprisoned.

Rebellions broke out in France and Anjou between 1111 and 1113, and Henry crossed into Normandy to support his nephew, Count <a href="Theobald%20II%20of%20Blois">Theobald II of Blois</a>, who had sided against Louis in the uprising. In a bid to diplomatically isolate the French king, Henry betrothed his young son, William Adelin, to Fulk's daughter <a href="Matilda%20of%20Anjou">Matilda</a>, and married his illegitimate daughter <a href="Matilda%20FitzRoy%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Brittany">Matilda</a> to Duke <a href="Conan%20III%20of%20Brittany">Conan III of Brittany</a>, creating alliances with Anjou and Brittany respectively. Louis backed down and in March 1113 met with Henry near Gisors to agree a peace settlement, giving Henry the disputed fortresses and confirming Henry's overlordship of Maine, Bellême and Brittany.

Meanwhile, the situation in Wales was deteriorating. Henry had conducted a campaign in South Wales in 1108, pushing out royal power in the region and colonising the area around Pembroke with Flemings. By 1114, some of the resident Norman lords were under attack, while in Mid-Wales, <a href="Owain%20ap%20Cadwgan">Owain ap Cadwgan</a> blinded one of the political hostages he was holding, and in North Wales <a href="Gruffudd%20ap%20Cynan">Gruffudd ap Cynan</a> threatened the power of the Earl of Chester. Henry sent three armies into Wales that year, with <a href="Gilbert%20Fitz%20Richard">Gilbert Fitz Richard</a> leading a force from the south, Alexander, King of Scotland, pressing from the north and Henry himself advancing into Mid-Wales. Owain and Gruffudd sued for peace, and Henry accepted a political compromise. Henry reinforced the Welsh Marches with his own appointees, strengthening the border territories.

Concerned about the succession, Henry sought to persuade Louis VI to accept his son, William Adelin, as the legitimate future Duke of Normandy, in exchange for his son's homage. Henry crossed into Normandy in 1115 and assembled the Norman barons to swear loyalty; he also almost successfully negotiated a settlement with King Louis, affirming William's right to the Duchy in exchange for a large sum of money, but the deal fell through and Louis, backed by his ally Baldwin of Flanders, instead declared that he considered William Clito the legitimate heir to the Duchy.

War broke out after Henry returned to Normandy with an army to support Theobald of Blois, who was under attack from Louis. Henry and Louis raided each other's towns along the border, and a wider conflict then broke out, probably in 1116. Henry was pushed onto the defensive as French, Flemish and Angevin forces began to pillage the Normandy countryside. <a href="Amaury%20III%20of%20Montfort">Amaury III of Montfort</a> and many other barons rose up against Henry, and there was an assassination plot from within his own household. Henry's wife, Matilda, died in early 1118, but the situation in Normandy was sufficiently pressing that Henry was unable to return to England for her funeral.

Henry responded by mounting campaigns against the rebel barons and deepening his alliance with Theobald. Baldwin of Flanders was wounded in battle and died in September 1118, easing the pressure on Normandy from the north-east. Henry attempted to crush a revolt in the city of <a href="Alen%C3%A7on">Alençon</a>, but was defeated by Fulk and the Angevin army. Forced to retreat from Alençon, Henry's position deteriorated alarmingly, as his resources became overstretched and more barons abandoned his cause. Early in 1119, Eustace of Breteuil and Henry's daughter, Juliana, threatened to join the baronial revolt. Hostages were exchanged in a bid to avoid conflict, but relations broke down and both sides mutilated their captives. Henry attacked and took the town of <a href="Breteuil%2C%20Eure">Breteuil</a>, despite Juliana's attempt to kill her father with a <a href="crossbow">crossbow</a>. In the aftermath, Henry dispossessed the couple of almost all of their lands in Normandy.

Henry's situation improved in May 1119 when he enticed Fulk to switch sides by finally agreeing to marry William Adelin to Fulk's daughter, <a href="Matilda%20of%20Anjou">Matilda</a>, and paying Fulk a large sum of money. Fulk left for the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>, leaving the County of Maine in Henry's care, and the King was free to focus on crushing his remaining enemies. During the summer Henry advanced into the Norman Vexin, where he encountered Louis's army, resulting in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Br%C3%A9mule">Battle of Brémule</a>. Henry appears to have deployed scouts and then organised his troops into several carefully formed lines of dismounted knights. Unlike Henry's forces, the French knights remained mounted; they hastily charged the Anglo-Norman positions, breaking through the first rank of the defences but then becoming entangled in Henry's second line of knights. Surrounded, the French army began to collapse. In the <a href="melee">melee</a>, Henry was hit by a sword blow, but his armour protected him. Louis and William Clito escaped from the battle, leaving Henry to return to Rouen in triumph.

The war slowly petered out after this battle, and Louis took the dispute over Normandy to <a href="Pope%20Callixtus%20II">Pope Callixtus II</a>'s council in <a href="Reims">Reims</a> that October. Henry faced a number of French complaints concerning his acquisition and subsequent management of Normandy, and despite being defended by <a href="Geoffrey%20Brito">Geoffrey</a>, the Archbishop of Rouen, Henry's case was shouted down by the pro-French elements of the council. Callixtus declined to support Louis, however, and merely advised the two rulers to seek peace. Amaury de Montfort came to terms with Henry, but Henry and William Clito failed to find a mutually satisfactory compromise. In June 1120, Henry and Louis formally made peace on terms advantageous to the King of England: William Adelin gave homage to Louis, and in return Louis confirmed William's rights to the Duchy.

Henry's succession plans were thrown into chaos by the sinking of the "<a href="White%20Ship">White Ship</a>" on 25 November 1120. Henry had left the port of Barfleur for England in the early evening, leaving William Adelin and many of the younger members of the court to follow on that night in a separate vessel, the "White Ship". Both the crew and passengers were drunk and, just outside the harbour, the ship hit a submerged rock. The ship sank, killing as many as 300 people, with only one survivor, a butcher from Rouen. Henry's court was initially too scared to report William's death to the King. When he was finally told, he collapsed with grief.

The disaster left Henry with no legitimate son, his various nephews now the closest possible male heirs. Henry announced he would take a new wife, <a href="Adeliza%20of%20Louvain">Adeliza of Louvain</a>, opening up the prospect of a new royal son, and the two were married at <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a> in January 1121. Henry appears to have chosen her because she was attractive and came from a prestigious noble line. Adeliza seems to have been fond of Henry and joined him in his travels, probably to maximise the chances of her conceiving a child. The "White Ship" disaster initiated fresh conflict in Wales, where the drowning of Richard, Earl of Chester, encouraged a rebellion led by <a href="Maredudd%20ap%20Bleddyn">Maredudd ap Bleddyn</a>. Henry intervened in North Wales that summer with an army and, although the King was hit by a Welsh arrow, the campaign reaffirmed royal power across the region.

With William dead, Henry's alliance with Anjou – which had been based on his son marrying Fulk's daughter – began to disintegrate. Fulk returned from the Levant and demanded that Henry return Matilda and her dowry, a range of estates and fortifications in Maine. Matilda left for Anjou, but Henry argued that the dowry had in fact originally belonged to him before it came into the possession of Fulk, and so declined to hand the estates back to Anjou. Fulk married his daughter <a href="Sibylla%20of%20Anjou">Sibylla</a> to William Clito, and granted them Maine. Once again, conflict broke out, as Amaury de Montfort allied himself with Fulk and led a revolt along the Norman-Anjou border in 1123. Amaury was joined by several other Norman barons, headed by <a href="Waleran%20de%20Beaumont%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Worcester">Waleran de Beaumont</a>, one of the sons of Henry's old ally, Robert of Meulan.

Henry dispatched Robert of Gloucester and Ranulf le Meschin to Normandy and then intervened himself in late 1123. Henry began the process of besieging the rebel castles, before wintering in the Duchy. In the spring of 1124, campaigning began again. In the <a href="battle%20of%20Bourgth%C3%A9roulde">battle of Bourgthéroulde</a>, Odo Borleng, castellan of <a href="Bernay%2C%20Eure">Bernay</a>, led the king’s army and received intelligence that the rebels were departing from the rebel base in <a href="Beaumont-le-Roger">Beaumont-le-Roger</a> allowing him to ambush them as they traversed through the <a href="Pont%20de%20Brotonne">Brotonne</a> forest. Waleran charged the royal forces, but his knights were cut down by Odo's archers and the rebels were quickly overwhelmed. Waleran was captured, but Amaury escaped. Henry mopped up the remainder of the rebellion, blinding some of the rebel leaders – considered, at the time, a more merciful punishment than execution – and recovering the last rebel castles. Henry paid Pope Callixtus a large amount of money, in exchange for the Papacy annulling the marriage of William Clito and Sibylla on the grounds of <a href="consanguinity">consanguinity</a>.

Henry and his new wife did not conceive any children, generating prurient speculation as to the possible explanation, and the future of the dynasty appeared at risk. Henry may have begun to look among his nephews for a possible heir. He may have considered <a href="Stephen%2C%20King%20of%20England">Stephen of Blois</a> as a possible option and, perhaps in preparation for this, he arranged a beneficial marriage for Stephen to a wealthy heiress, <a href="Matilda%20of%20Boulogne">Matilda</a>. Theobald of Blois, his close ally, may have also felt that he was in favour with Henry. William Clito, who was King Louis's preferred choice, remained opposed to Henry and was therefore unsuitable. Henry may have also considered his own illegitimate son, Robert of Gloucester, as a possible candidate, but English tradition and custom would have looked unfavourably on this.

Henry's plans shifted when the Empress Matilda's husband, the Emperor Henry, died in 1125. King Henry recalled his daughter to England the next year and declared that, should he die without a male heir, she was to be his rightful successor. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster at Christmas 1126, where they swore to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have. Putting forward a woman as a potential heir in this way was unusual: opposition to Matilda continued to exist within the English court, and Louis was vehemently opposed to her candidacy.

Fresh conflict broke out in 1127, when <a href="Charles%20I%2C%20Count%20of%20Flanders">Charles</a>, the childless <a href="Count%20of%20Flanders">Count of Flanders</a>, was murdered, creating a local succession crisis. Backed by King Louis, William Clito was chosen by the Flemings to become their new ruler. This development potentially threatened Normandy, and Henry began to finance a <a href="proxy%20war">proxy war</a> in Flanders, promoting the claims of William's Flemish rivals. In an effort to disrupt the French alliance with William, Henry mounted an attack into France in 1128, forcing Louis to cut his aid to William. William died unexpectedly in July, removing the last major challenger to Henry's rule and bringing the war in Flanders to a halt. Without William, the baronial opposition in Normandy lacked a leader. A fresh peace was made with France, and the King was finally able to release the remaining prisoners from the revolt of 1123, including Waleran of Meulan, who was rehabilitated into the royal court.

Meanwhile, Henry rebuilt his alliance with Fulk of Anjou, this time by marrying Matilda to Fulk's eldest son, <a href="Geoffrey%20Plantagenet%2C%20Count%20of%20Anjou">Geoffrey</a>. The pair were betrothed in 1127 and married the following year. It is unknown whether Henry intended Geoffrey to have any future claim on England or Normandy, and he was probably keeping his son-in-law's status deliberately uncertain. Similarly, although Matilda was granted a number of Normandy castles as part of her dowry, it was not specified when the couple would actually take possession of them. Fulk left Anjou for Jerusalem in 1129, declaring Geoffrey the Count of Anjou and Maine. The marriage proved difficult, as the couple did not particularly like each other and the disputed castles proved a point of contention, resulting in Matilda returning to Normandy later that year. Henry appears to have blamed Geoffrey for the separation, but in 1131 the couple were reconciled. Much to the pleasure and relief of Henry, Matilda then gave birth to a sequence of two sons, <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry</a> and <a href="Geoffrey%2C%20Count%20of%20Nantes">Geoffrey</a>, in 1133 and 1134.

Relations between Henry, Matilda, and Geoffrey became increasingly strained during the King's final years. Matilda and Geoffrey suspected that they lacked genuine support in England. In 1135 they urged Henry to hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda whilst he was still alive, and insisted that the Norman nobility swear immediate allegiance to her, thereby giving the couple a more powerful position after Henry's death. Henry angrily declined to do so, probably out of concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy. A fresh rebellion broke out amongst the barons in southern Normandy, led by <a href="William%20III%2C%20Count%20of%20Ponthieu">William</a>, the <a href="Count%20of%20Ponthieu">Count of Ponthieu</a>, whereupon Geoffrey and Matilda intervened in support of the rebels.

Henry campaigned throughout the autumn, strengthening the southern frontier, and then travelled to <a href="Lyons-la-For%C3%AAt">Lyons-la-Forêt</a> in November to enjoy some hunting, still apparently healthy. There Henry fell ill – according to the chronicler <a href="Henry%20of%20Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a>, he ate too many ("a surfeit of") <a href="lamprey">lamprey</a>s against his physician's advice – and his condition worsened over the course of a week. Once the condition appeared terminal, Henry gave confession and summoned Archbishop <a href="Hugh%20of%20Amiens">Hugh of Amiens</a>, who was joined by Robert of Gloucester and other members of the court. In accordance with custom, preparations were made to settle Henry's outstanding debts and to revoke outstanding sentences of forfeiture. The King died on 1 December 1135, and his corpse was taken to Rouen accompanied by the barons, where it was embalmed; his entrails were buried locally at the <a href="priory">priory</a> of Notre-Dame du Pré, and the preserved body was taken on to England, where it was interred at Reading Abbey.

Despite Henry's efforts, the succession was disputed. When news began to spread of the King's death, Geoffrey and Matilda were in Anjou supporting the rebels in their campaign against the royal army, which included a number of Matilda's supporters such as Robert of Gloucester. Many of these barons had taken an oath to stay in Normandy until the late king was properly buried, which prevented them from returning to England. The Norman nobility discussed declaring Theobald of Blois king. Theobald's younger brother, Stephen of Blois, quickly crossed from Boulogne to England, however, accompanied by his military household. With the help of his brother, <a href="Henry%20of%20Blois">Henry of Blois</a>, he seized power in England and was crowned king on 22 December. The Empress Matilda did not give up her claim to England and Normandy, leading to the prolonged civil war known as <a href="the%20Anarchy">the Anarchy</a> between 1135 and 1153.

Historians have drawn on a range of sources on Henry, including the accounts of chroniclers; other documentary evidence, including early <a href="pipe%20roll">pipe roll</a>s; and surviving buildings and architecture. The three main chroniclers to describe the events of Henry's life were William of Malmesbury, Orderic Vitalis, and Henry of Huntingdon, but each incorporated extensive social and moral commentary into their accounts and borrowed a range of literary devices and stereotypical events from other popular works. Other chroniclers include <a href="Eadmer">Eadmer</a>, <a href="Hugh%20the%20Chanter">Hugh the Chanter</a>, <a href="Abbot%20Suger">Abbot Suger</a>, and the authors of the Welsh "<a href="Brut%20y%20Tywysogion">Brut</a>". Not all royal documents from the period have survived, but there are a number of royal acts, charters, writs, and letters, along with some early financial records. Some of these have since been discovered to be forgeries, and others had been subsequently amended or tampered with.

Late medieval historians seized on the accounts of selected chroniclers regarding Henry's education and gave him the title of Henry "Beauclerc", a theme echoed in the analysis of <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> and <a href="Edwardian%20era">Edwardian</a> historians such as <a href="Francis%20Palgrave">Francis Palgrave</a> and <a href="Henry%20William%20Carless%20Davis">Henry Davis</a>. The historian Charles David dismissed this argument in 1929, showing the more extreme claims for Henry's education to be without foundation. Modern histories of Henry commenced with <a href="R.%20W.%20Southern">Richard Southern</a>'s work in the early 1960s, followed by extensive research during the rest of the 20th century into a wide number of themes from his reign in England, and a much more limited number of studies of his rule in Normandy. Only two major, modern biographies of Henry have been produced, Warren Hollister's posthumous volume in 2001, and Judith Green's 2006 work.

Interpretation of Henry's personality by historians has altered over time. Earlier historians such as <a href="Austin%20Lane%20Poole">Austin Poole</a> and Richard Southern considered Henry as a cruel, draconian ruler. More recent historians, such as Hollister and Green, view his implementation of justice much more sympathetically, particularly when set against the standards of the day, but even Green has noted that Henry was "in many respects highly unpleasant", and Alan Cooper has observed that many contemporary chroniclers were probably too scared of the King to voice much criticism. Historians have also debated the extent to which Henry's administrative reforms genuinely constituted an introduction of what Hollister and John Baldwin have termed systematic, "administrative kingship", or whether his outlook remained fundamentally traditional.

Henry's burial at <a href="Reading%20Abbey">Reading Abbey</a> is marked by a local cross and a plaque, but Reading Abbey was slowly demolished during the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a> in the 16th century. The exact location is uncertain, but the most likely location of the tomb itself is now in a built-up area of central Reading, on the site of the former abbey choir. A plan to locate his remains was announced in March 2015, with support from <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> and <a href="Philippa%20Langley">Philippa Langley</a>, who aided with the successful <a href="Exhumation%20of%20Richard%20III%20of%20England">exhumation of Richard III</a>.

In addition to Matilda and William, Henry possibly had a short-lived son, Richard, with his first wife, Matilda of Scotland. Henry and his second wife, Adeliza of Louvain, had no children.

Henry had a number of illegitimate children by various mistresses.

I. M. Pei

Ieoh Ming Pei, <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20American%20Institute%20of%20Architects">FAIA</a>, <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects">RIBA</a> (born 26 April 1917), commonly known as I. M. Pei, is a <a href="Chinese%20American">Chinese American</a> architect. Born in <a href="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a> and raised in <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, Pei drew inspiration at an early age from the gardens at <a href="Suzhou">Soochow</a>. In 1935, he moved to the United States and enrolled in the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>'s architecture school, but quickly transferred to the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>. He was unhappy with the focus at both schools on <a href="Beaux-Arts%20architecture">Beaux-Arts architecture</a>, and spent his free time researching emerging architects, especially <a href="Le%20Corbusier">Le Corbusier</a>. After graduating, he joined the <a href="Harvard%20Graduate%20School%20of%20Design">Harvard Graduate School of Design</a> (GSD) and became a friend of the <a href="Bauhaus">Bauhaus</a> architects <a href="Walter%20Gropius">Walter Gropius</a> and <a href="Marcel%20Breuer">Marcel Breuer</a>. In 1948, Pei was recruited by <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> real estate magnate <a href="William%20Zeckendorf">William Zeckendorf</a>, for whom he worked for seven years before establishing his own independent design firm I. M. Pei & Associates in 1955, which became I. M. Pei & Partners in 1966 and later in 1989 became <a href="Pei%20Cobb%20Freed%20%26amp%3B%20Partners">Pei Cobb Freed & Partners</a>. Pei retired from full-time practice in 1990. Since then, he has taken on work as an architectural consultant primarily from his sons' architectural firm <a href="Pei%20Partnership%20Architects">Pei Partnership Architects</a>.

Pei's first major recognition came with the <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Atmospheric%20Research">National Center for Atmospheric Research</a> in Colorado (designed in 1961, and completed in 1967). His new stature led to his selection as chief architect for the <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20Library">John F. Kennedy Library</a> in Massachusetts. He went on to design <a href="Dallas%20City%20Hall">Dallas City Hall</a> and the East Building of the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Art">National Gallery of Art</a>. He returned to China for the first time in 1975 to design a hotel at <a href="Fragrant%20Hills">Fragrant Hills</a>, and designed <a href="Bank%20of%20China%20Tower%2C%20Hong%20Kong">Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong</a>, a skyscraper in Hong Kong for the <a href="Bank%20of%20China">Bank of China</a> fifteen years later. In the early 1980s, Pei was the focus of controversy when he designed <a href="Louvre%20Pyramid">a glass-and-steel pyramid</a> for the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20du%20Louvre">Musée du Louvre</a> in Paris. He later returned to the world of the arts by designing the <a href="Morton%20H.%20Meyerson%20Symphony%20Center">Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center</a> in Dallas, the <a href="Miho%20Museum">Miho Museum</a> in Japan, the <a href="Suzhou%20Museum">Suzhou Museum</a> in Suzhou, <a href="Museum%20of%20Islamic%20Art%2C%20Doha">Museum of Islamic Art</a> in <a href="Qatar">Qatar</a>, and the <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Jean%20Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art</a>, abbreviated to Mudam, in <a href="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>.

Pei has won a wide variety of prizes and awards in the field of architecture, including the <a href="AIA%20Gold%20Medal">AIA Gold Medal</a> in 1979, the first <a href="Praemium%20Imperiale">Praemium Imperiale</a> for Architecture in 1989, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the <a href="Cooper-Hewitt%2C%20National%20Design%20Museum">Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum</a> in 2003. In 1983, he won the <a href="Pritzker%20Prize">Pritzker Prize</a>, sometimes called the <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a> of architecture.

Pei's ancestry traces back to the <a href="Ming%20Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a>, when his family moved from <a href="Anhui">Anhui</a> province to <a href="Suzhou">Suzhou</a>. Finding wealth in the sale of medicinal herbs, the family stressed the importance of helping the less fortunate. Ieoh Ming Pei was born on 26 April 1917 to Tsuyee and Lien Kwun, and the family moved to <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> one year later. The family eventually included five children. As a boy, Pei was very close to his mother, a devout <a href="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> who was recognized for her skills as a <a href="flautist">flautist</a>. She invited him (and not his brothers or sisters) to join her on meditation retreats. His relationship with his father was less intimate. Their interactions were respectful but distant.

Pei's ancestors' success meant that the family lived in the upper echelons of society, but Pei said his father was "not cultivated in the ways of the arts". The younger Pei, drawn more to music and other cultural forms than to his father's domain of banking, explored art on his own. "I have cultivated myself," he said later.

At the age of ten, Pei moved with his family to Shanghai after his father was promoted. Pei attended Saint Johns Middle School, run by <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> missionaries. Academic discipline was rigorous; students were allowed only one half-day each month for leisure. Pei enjoyed playing <a href="Cue%20sports">billiards</a> and watching Hollywood movies, especially those of <a href="Buster%20Keaton">Buster Keaton</a> and <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>. He also learned rudimentary English skills by reading the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> and novels by <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>.

Shanghai's many international elements gave it the name "Paris of the East". The city's global architectural flavors had a profound influence on Pei, from the <a href="The%20Bund%20%28Shanghai%29">Bund</a> waterfront area to the <a href="Park%20Hotel%20Shanghai">Park Hotel</a>, built in 1934. He was also impressed by the many gardens of Suzhou, where he spent the summers with extended family and regularly visited a nearby ancestral shrine. The <a href="Lion%20Grove%20Garden">Shizilin Garden</a>, built in the 14th century by a Buddhist monk, was especially influential. Its unusual rock formations, stone bridges, and waterfalls remained etched in Pei's memory for decades. He spoke later of his fondness for the garden's blending of natural and human-built structures.

Soon after the move to Shanghai, Pei's mother developed cancer. As a pain reliever, she was prescribed <a href="opium">opium</a>, and assigned the task of preparing her pipe to Pei. She died shortly after his thirteenth birthday, and he was profoundly upset. The children were sent to live with extended family; their father became more consumed by his work and more physically distant. Pei said: "My father began living his own separate life pretty soon after that." His father later married a woman named Aileen, who moved to New York later in her life.

As Pei, neared the end of his secondary education, he decided to study at a university. He was accepted to a number of schools, but decided to enroll at the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>. Pei's choice had two roots. While studying in Shanghai, he had closely examined the catalogs for various institutions of higher learning around the world. The architectural program at the University of Pennsylvania stood out to him. The other major factor was Hollywood. Pei was fascinated by the representations of college life in the films of <a href="Bing%20Crosby">Bing Crosby</a>, which differed tremendously from the academic atmosphere in China. "College life in the U.S. seemed to me to be mostly fun and games", he said in 2000. "Since I was too young to be serious, I wanted to be part of it ... You could get a feeling for it in Bing Crosby's movies. College life in America seemed very exciting to me. It's not real, we know that. Nevertheless, at that time it was very attractive to me. I decided that was the country for me."

In 1935 Pei boarded a boat and sailed to San Francisco, then traveled by train to Philadelphia. What he found, however, differed vastly from his expectations. Professors at the University of Pennsylvania based their teaching in the <a href="Beaux-Arts%20architecture">Beaux-Arts style</a>, rooted in the classical traditions of Greece and Rome. Pei was more intrigued by <a href="modern%20architecture">modern architecture</a>, and also felt intimidated by the high level of <a href="Architectural%20drawing">drafting</a> proficiency shown by other students. He decided to abandon architecture and transferred to the engineering program at <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT). Once he arrived, however, the dean of the architecture school commented on his eye for design and convinced Pei to return to his original major.

MIT's architecture faculty was also focused on the Beaux-Arts school, and Pei found himself uninspired by the work. In the library he found three books by the Swiss-French architect <a href="Le%20Corbusier">Le Corbusier</a>. Pei was inspired by the innovative designs of the new <a href="International%20Style%20%28architecture%29">International style</a>, characterized by simplified form and the use of glass and steel materials. Le Corbusier visited MIT in , an occasion which powerfully affected Pei: "The two days with Le Corbusier, or 'Corbu' as we used to call him, were probably the most important days in my architectural education." Pei was also influenced by the work of US architect <a href="Frank%20Lloyd%20Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>. In 1938 he drove to <a href="Spring%20Green%2C%20Wisconsin">Spring Green, Wisconsin</a>, to visit Wright's famous <a href="Taliesin%20%28studio%29">Taliesin</a> building. After waiting for two hours, however, he left without meeting Wright.

Although he disliked the Beaux-Arts emphasis at MIT, Pei excelled in his studies. "I certainly don't regret the time at MIT", he said later. "There I learned the science and technique of building, which is just as essential to architecture." Pei received his <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Architecture">B.Arch.</a> degree in 1940.

While visiting New York City in the late '30s, Pei met a <a href="Wellesley%20College">Wellesley College</a> student named Eileen Loo. They began dating and they married in the spring of 1942. She enrolled in the <a href="landscape%20architecture">landscape architecture</a> program at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>, and Pei was thus introduced to members of the faculty at Harvard's <a href="Harvard%20Graduate%20School%20of%20Design">Graduate School of Design</a> (GSD). He was excited by the lively atmosphere, and joined the GSD in .

Less than a month later, Pei suspended his work at Harvard to join the <a href="National%20Defense%20Research%20Committee">National Defense Research Committee</a>, which coordinated scientific research into US weapons technology during <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">World War II</a>. Pei's background in architecture was seen as a considerable asset; one member of the committee told him: "If you know how to build you should also know how to destroy." The fight against Germany was ending, so he focused on the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>. The US realized that its bombs used against the stone buildings of Europe would be ineffective against Japanese cities, mostly constructed from wood and paper; Pei was assigned to work on <a href="incendiary%20device">incendiary bombs</a>. Pei spent two and a half years with the NDRC, but has revealed few details.

In 1945 Eileen gave birth to a son, T'ing Chung; she withdrew from the landscape architecture program in order to care for him. Pei returned to Harvard in the autumn of 1945, and received a position as assistant professor of design. The GSD was developing into a hub of resistance to the Beaux-Arts orthodoxy. At the center were members of the <a href="Bauhaus">Bauhaus</a>, a European architectural movement that had advanced the cause of modernist design. The Nazi regime had condemned the Bauhaus school, and its leaders left Germany. Two of these, <a href="Walter%20Gropius">Walter Gropius</a> and <a href="Marcel%20Breuer">Marcel Breuer</a>, took positions at the Harvard GSD. Their iconoclastic focus on modern architecture appealed to Pei, and he worked closely with both men.

One of Pei's design projects at the GSD was a plan for an art museum in Shanghai. He wanted to create a mood of Chinese authenticity in the architecture without using traditional materials or styles. The design was based on straight modernist structures, organized around a central courtyard garden, with other similar natural settings arranged nearby. It was very well received; Gropius, in fact, called it "the best thing done in [my] master class". Pei received his <a href="Master%20of%20Architecture">M.Arch.</a> degree in 1946, and taught at Harvard for another two years.

In the spring of 1948 Pei was recruited by New York real estate magnate <a href="William%20Zeckendorf">William Zeckendorf</a> to join a staff of architects for his firm of <a href="Webb%20and%20Knapp">Webb and Knapp</a> to design buildings around the country. Pei found Zeckendorf's personality the opposite of his own; his new boss was known for his loud speech and gruff demeanor. Nevertheless, they became good friends and Pei found the experience personally enriching. Zeckendorf was well connected politically, and Pei enjoyed learning about the social world of New York's city planners.

His first project for Webb and Knapp was an apartment building with funding from the <a href="Housing%20Act%20of%201949">Housing Act of 1949</a>. Pei's design was based on a circular tower with concentric rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation; the apartments themselves were located toward the outer edge. Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier when they met. The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never moved beyond the model stage.

Pei finally saw his architecture come to life in 1949, when he designed a two-story <a href="131%20Ponce%20de%20Leon%20Avenue">corporate building for Gulf Oil</a> in Atlanta, Georgia. The building was demolished in February 2013 although the front facade will be retained as part of an apartment development. His use of marble for the exterior <a href="curtain%20wall%20%28architecture%29">curtain wall</a> brought praise from the journal "Architectural Forum". Pei's designs echoed the work of <a href="Mies%20van%20der%20Rohe">Mies van der Rohe</a> in the beginning of his career as also shown in his own weekend-house in Katonah in 1952. Soon Pei was so inundated with projects that he asked Zeckendorf for assistants, which he chose from his associates at the GSD, including <a href="Henry%20N.%20Cobb">Henry N. Cobb</a> and <a href="Ulrich%20Franzen">Ulrich Franzen</a>. They set to work on a variety of proposals, including the <a href="Roosevelt%20Field%20%28Shopping%20Mall%29">Roosevelt Field Shopping Mall</a>. The team also redesigned the Webb and Knapp office building, transforming Zeckendorf's office into a circular space with <a href="teak">teak</a> walls and a glass <a href="clerestory">clerestory</a>. They also installed a control panel into the desk that allowed their boss to control the lighting in his office. The project took one year and exceeded its budget, but Zeckendorf was delighted with the results.

In 1952 Pei and his team began work on a series of projects in Denver, Colorado. The first of these was the Mile High Center, which compressed the core building into less than twenty-five percent of the total site; the rest is adorned with an exhibition hall and fountain-dotted plazas. One block away, Pei's team also redesigned Denver's Courthouse Square, which combined office spaces, commercial venues, and hotels. These projects helped Pei conceptualize architecture as part of the larger urban geography. "I learned the process of development," he said later, "and about the city as a living organism." These lessons, he said, became essential for later projects.

Pei and his team also designed a united urban area for Washington, D.C., <a href="L%27Enfant%20Plaza">L'Enfant Plaza</a> (named for French-American architect <a href="Pierre%20Charles%20L%27Enfant">Pierre Charles L'Enfant</a>). Pei's associate <a href="Araldo%20Cossutta">Araldo Cossutta</a> was the lead architect for the plaza's North Building (955 L'Enfant Plaza SW) and South Building (490 L'Enfant Plaza SW). <a href="Vlastimil%20Koubek">Vlastimil Koubek</a> was the architect for the East Building (<a href="L%27Enfant%20Plaza%20Hotel">L'Enfant Plaza Hotel</a>, located at 480 L'Enfant Plaza SW), and for the Center Building (475 L'Enfant Plaza SW; now the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service</a> headquarters). The team set out with a broad vision that was praised by both "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" and "<a href="Washington%20Star">Washington Star</a>" (which rarely agreed on anything), but funding problems forced revisions and a significant reduction in scale.

In 1955 Pei's group took a step toward institutional independence from Webb and Knapp by establishing a new firm called I. M. Pei & Associates. (The name changed later to I. M. Pei & Partners.) They gained the freedom to work with other companies, but continued working primarily with Zeckendorf. The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed <a href="architectural%20model">architectural model</a>s. They took on the <a href="Kips%20Bay">Kips Bay</a> residential area on the east side of Manhattan, where Pei set up <a href="Kips%20Bay%20Towers">Kips Bay Towers</a>, two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) in a neat grid, adorned with rows of trees. Pei involved himself in the construction process at Kips Bay, even inspecting the bags of concrete to check for consistency of color.

The company continued its urban focus with the <a href="Society%20Hill">Society Hill</a> project in central <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. Pei designed the <a href="Society%20Hill%20Towers">Society Hill Towers</a>, a three-building residential block injecting cubist design into the 18th-century milieu of the neighborhood. As with previous projects, abundant green spaces were central to Pei's vision, which also added traditional <a href="townhouse">townhouse</a>s to aid the transition from classical to modern design.

From 1958 to 1963 Pei and <a href="Ray%20Affleck">Ray Affleck</a> developed a key downtown block of Montreal in a phased process that involved one of Pei's most admired structures in the Commonwealth, the cruciform tower known as the Royal Bank Plaza (<a href="Place%20Ville%20Marie">Place Ville Marie</a>). According to the <a href="Canadian%20Encyclopedia">Canadian Encyclopedia</a> "its grand plaza and lower office buildings, designed by internationally famous US architect I. M. Pei, helped to set new standards for architecture in Canada in the 1960s ... The tower's smooth aluminum and glass surface and crisp unadorned geometric form demonstrate Pei's adherence to the mainstream of 20th-century modern design."

Although these projects were satisfying, Pei wanted to establish an independent name for himself. In 1959 he was approached by MIT to design a building for its <a href="Earth%20science">Earth science</a> program. The <a href="Green%20Building%20%28MIT%29">Green Building</a> continued the grid design of Kips Bay and Society Hill. The pedestrian walkway at the ground floor, however, was prone to sudden gusts of wind, which embarrassed Pei. "Here I was from MIT," he said, "and I didn't know about <a href="wind-tunnel">wind-tunnel</a> effects." At the same time, he designed the <a href="Luce%20Memorial%20Chapel">Luce Memorial Chapel</a> in at <a href="Tunghai%20University">Tunghai University</a> in <a href="Taichung">Taichung</a>, <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>. The soaring structure, commissioned by the same organisation that had run his middle school in Shanghai, broke severely from the cubist grid patterns of his urban projects.

The challenge of coordinating these projects took an artistic toll on Pei. He found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising the plans for them. As a result, he felt disconnected from the actual creative work. "Design is something you have to put your hand to," he said. "While my people had the luxury of doing one job at a time, I had to keep track of the whole enterprise." Pei's dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing Zeckendorf's firm. I. M. Pei and Associates officially broke from Webb and Knapp in 1960, which benefited Pei creatively but pained him personally. He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways.

Pei was able to return to hands-on design when he was approached in 1961 by <a href="Walter%20Orr%20Roberts">Walter Orr Roberts</a> to design the new <a href="Mesa%20Laboratory">Mesa Laboratory</a> for the <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Atmospheric%20Research">National Center for Atmospheric Research</a> outside <a href="Boulder%2C%20Colorado">Boulder, Colorado</a>. The project differed from Pei's earlier urban work; it would rest in an open area in the foothills of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>. He drove with his wife around the region, visiting assorted buildings and surveying the natural environs. He was impressed by the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force%20Academy">United States Air Force Academy</a> in Colorado Springs, but felt it was "detached from nature".

The conceptualization stages were important for Pei, presenting a need and an opportunity to break from the Bauhaus tradition. He later recalled the long periods of time he spent in the area: "I recalled the places I had seen with my mother when I was a little boy—the mountaintop Buddhist retreats. There in the Colorado mountains, I tried to listen to the silence again—just as my mother had taught me. The investigation of the place became a kind of religious experience for me."
Pei also drew inspiration from the <a href="Mesa%20Verde%20National%20Park">Mesa Verde</a> cliff dwellings of the <a href="Ancient%20Pueblo%20Peoples">Ancient Pueblo Peoples</a>; he wanted the buildings to exist in harmony with their natural surroundings. To this end, he called for a rock-treatment process that could color the buildings to match the nearby mountains. He also set the complex back on the mesa overlooking the city, and designed the approaching road to be long, winding, and indirect.

Roberts disliked Pei's initial designs, referring to them as "just a bunch of towers". Roberts intended his comments as typical of scientific experimentation, rather than artistic critique; still, Pei was frustrated. His second attempt, however, fit Roberts' vision perfectly: a spaced-out series of clustered buildings, joined by lower structures and complemented by two underground levels. The complex uses many elements of cubist design, and the walkways are arranged to increase the probability of casual encounters among colleagues.

Once the laboratory was built, several problems with its construction became apparent. Leaks in the roof caused difficulties for researchers, and the shifting of clay soil beneath caused cracks in the buildings which were expensive to repair. Still, both architect and project manager were pleased with the final result. Pei refers to the NCAR complex as his "breakout building", and he remained a friend of Roberts until the scientist died in .

The success of NCAR brought renewed attention to Pei's design acumen. He was recruited to work on a variety of projects, including the <a href="S.%20I.%20Newhouse%20School%20of%20Public%20Communications">S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications</a> at <a href="Syracuse%20University">Syracuse University</a>, the <a href="Sundrome">Sundrome</a> terminal at <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport">John F. Kennedy International Airport</a> in New York City, and dormitories at <a href="New%20College%20of%20Florida">New College of Florida</a>.

After President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> was <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20assassination">assassinated</a> in , his family and friends discussed how to construct a library that would serve as a fitting memorial. A committee was formed to advise Kennedy's widow <a href="Jacqueline%20Kennedy%20Onassis">Jacqueline</a>, who would make the final decision. The group deliberated for months and considered many famous architects. Eventually, Kennedy chose Pei to design the library, based on two considerations. First, she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects. "He didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem," she said. "He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful." Ultimately, however, Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei. Calling it "really an emotional decision", she explained: "He was so full of promise, like Jack; they were born in the same year. I decided it would be fun to take a great leap with him."

The project was plagued with problems from the outset. The first was scope. President Kennedy had begun considering the structure of his library soon after taking office, and he wanted to include archives from his administration, a museum of personal items, and a political science institute. After the assassination, the list expanded to include a fitting memorial tribute to the slain president. The variety of necessary inclusions complicated the design process and caused significant delays.

Pei's first proposed design included a large glass pyramid that would fill the interior with sunlight, meant to represent the optimism and hope that Kennedy's administration had symbolized for so many in the US. Mrs. Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in Cambridge, the first proposed site for the building, as soon as the project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby <a href="Harvard%20Square">Harvard Square</a>. By the mid-70s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort. These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife. "I could tell how tired he was by the way he opened the door at the end of the day," she said. "His footsteps were dragging. It was very hard for I. M. to see that so many people didn't want the building."

Finally the project moved to <a href="Columbia%20Point%20%28Boston%29">Columbia Point</a>, near the <a href="University%20of%20Massachusetts%20Boston">University of Massachusetts Boston</a>. The new site was less than ideal; it was located on an old landfill, and just over a large sewage pipe. Pei's architectural team added more fill to cover the pipe and developed an elaborate ventilation system to conquer the odor. A new design was unveiled, combining a large square glass-enclosed atrium with a triangular tower and a circular walkway.

The <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20Library">John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum</a> was dedicated on 20 October 1979. Critics generally liked the finished building, but the architect himself was unsatisfied. The years of conflict and compromise had changed the nature of the design, and Pei felt that the final result lacked its original passion. "I wanted to give something very special to the memory of President Kennedy," he said in 2000. "It could and should have been a great project." Pei's work on the Kennedy project boosted his reputation as an architect of note.

The Pei Plan was an urban redevelopment initiative designed for downtown <a href="Oklahoma%20City%2C%20Oklahoma">Oklahoma City, Oklahoma</a>, in the 1960s and 1970s. It is the informal name for two related commissions by Pei – namely the Central Business District General Neighborhood Renewal Plan (design completed 1964) and the Central Business District Project I-A Development Plan (design completed 1966). It was formally adopted in 1965, and implemented in various public and private phases throughout the 1960s and 1970s.

The plan called for the demolition of hundreds of old downtown structures in favor of renewed parking, office building, and retail developments, in addition to public projects such as the Myriad Convention Center and the Myriad Botanical Gardens. It was the dominant template for downtown development in Oklahoma City from its inception through the 1970s. The plan generated mixed results and opinion, largely succeeding in re-developing office building and parking infrastructure but failing to attract its anticipated retail and residential development. Significant public resentment also developed as a result of the destruction of multiple historic structures. As a result, Oklahoma City's leadership avoided large-scale urban planning for downtown throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, until the passage of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Area%20Projects%20Plan">Metropolitan Area Projects</a> (MAPS) initiative in 1993.

Another city which turned to Pei for urban renewal during this time was <a href="Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Providence, Rhode Island</a>. In the late 1960s, Providence hired Pei to redesign <a href="Cathedral%20of%20Saints%20Peter%20and%20Paul%20%28Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island%29%23Cathedral%20Square">Cathedral Square</a>, a once-bustling civic center which had become neglected and empty, as part of an ambitious larger plan to redesign downtown. Pei's new plaza, modeled after the Greek <a href="Agora">Agora</a> marketplace, opened in 1972. Unfortunately, the city ran out of money before Pei's vision could be fully realized. Also, recent construction of a low-income housing complex and <a href="Interstate%2095%20in%20Rhode%20Island">Interstate 95</a> had changed the neighborhood's character permanently. In 1974, <a href="The%20Providence%20Journal">The Providence Evening Bulletin</a> called Pei's new plaza a "conspicuous failure." By 2016, media reports characterized the plaza as a neglected, little-visited "hidden gem".

In 1974, <a href="Augusta%2C%20GA">Augusta, GA</a> turned to Pei and his firm for downtown revitalization. From the plan, the Chamber of Commence building and Bicentennial Park, were completed. In 1976, Pei designed a distinctive modern penthouse, that was added to the roof of architect <a href="William%20Lee%20Stoddart">William Lee Stoddart</a>'s historic <a href="Lamar%20Building">Lamar Building</a>, designed in 1916. The penthouse is a modern take on a pyramid, predating Pei's more famous <a href="Louvre%20Pyramid">Louvre Pyramid</a>. It has been criticized by architectural critic <a href="James%20Howard%20Kunstler">James Howard Kunstler</a> as an "Eyesore of the Month" with him comparing it to <a href="Darth%20Vader">Darth Vader</a>'s helmet. In 1980, he and his company designed the Augusta Civic Center, now known as the <a href="James%20Brown%20Arena">James Brown Arena</a>.

Kennedy's assassination led indirectly to another commission for Pei's firm. In 1964 the acting mayor, <a href="J.%20Erik%20Jonsson">Erik Jonsson</a>, began working to change the community's image. Dallas was known and disliked as the city where the president had been killed, but Jonsson began a program designed to initiate a community renewal. One of the goals was a new city hall, which could be a "symbol of the people". Jonsson, a co-founder of Texas Instruments, learned about Pei from his associate Cecil Howard Green, who had recruited the architect for MIT's Earth Sciences building.

Pei's approach to the new <a href="Dallas%20City%20Hall">Dallas City Hall</a> mirrored those of other projects; he surveyed the surrounding area and worked to make the building fit. In the case of Dallas, he spent days meeting with residents of the city and was impressed by their civic pride. He also found that the skyscrapers of the downtown business district dominated the skyline, and sought to create a building which could face the tall buildings and represent the importance of the public sector. He spoke of creating "a public-private dialogue with the commercial high-rises".

Working with his associate Theodore Musho, Pei developed a design centered on a building with a top much wider than the bottom; the facade leans at an angle of 34 degrees. A plaza stretches out before the building, and a series of support columns holds it up. It was influenced by Le Corbusier's <a href="Government%20of%20Chandigarh">High Court building in Chandigarh</a>, India; Pei sought to use the significant overhang to unify building and plaza. The project cost much more than initially expected, and took 11 years. Revenue was secured in part by including a subterranean parking garage. The interior of the city hall is large and spacious; windows in the ceiling above the eighth floor fill the main space with light.
The city of Dallas received the building well, and a local television news crew found unanimous approval of the new city hall when it officially opened to the public in 1978. Pei himself considered the project a success, even as he worried about the arrangement of its elements. He said: "It's perhaps stronger than I would have liked; it's got more strength than finesse." He felt that his relative lack of experience left him without the necessary design tools to refine his vision, but the community liked the city hall enough to invite him back. Over the years he went on to design five additional buildings in the Dallas area.

While Pei and Musho were coordinating the Dallas project, their associate <a href="Henry%20N.%20Cobb">Henry Cobb</a> had taken the helm for a commission in Boston. <a href="John%20Hancock%20Insurance">John Hancock Insurance</a> chairman Robert Slater hired I. M. Pei & Partners to design a building that could overshadow the <a href="Prudential%20Tower">Prudential Tower</a>, erected by <a href="Prudential%20Insurance">their rival</a>.

After the firm's first plan was discarded due to a need for more office space, Cobb developed a new plan around a towering parallelogram, slanted away from the <a href="Trinity%20Church%20%28Boston%29">Trinity Church</a> and accented by a wedge cut into each narrow side. To minimize the visual impact, the building was covered in large reflective glass panels; Cobb said this would make the building a "background and foil" to the older structures around it. When the <a href="200%20Clarendon%20Street">Hancock Tower</a> was finished in 1976, it was the tallest building in <a href="New%20England">New England</a>.

Serious issues of execution became evident in the tower almost immediately. Many glass panels fractured in a windstorm during construction in 1973. Some detached and fell to the ground, causing no injuries but sparking concern among Boston residents. In response, the entire tower was reglazed with smaller panels. This significantly increased the cost of the project. Hancock sued the glass manufacturers, Libbey-Owens-Ford, as well as I. M. Pei & Partners, for submitting plans that were "not good and workmanlike". LOF countersued Hancock for defamation, accusing Pei's firm of poor use of their materials; I. M. Pei & Partners sued LOF in return. All three companies settled out of court in 1981.

The project became an <a href="Albatross%20%28metaphor%29">albatross</a> for Pei's firm. Pei himself refused to discuss it for many years. The pace of new commissions slowed and the firm's architects began looking overseas for opportunities. Cobb worked in <a href="Australia">Australia</a> and Pei took on jobs in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, and <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>. Although it was a difficult time for everyone involved, Pei later reflected with patience on the experience. "Going through this trial toughened us," he said. "It helped to cement us as partners; we did not give up on each other."

In the mid-1960s, directors of the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Art">National Gallery of Art</a> in Washington, D.C., declared the need for a new building. <a href="Paul%20Mellon">Paul Mellon</a>, a primary benefactor of the gallery and a member of its building committee, set to work with his assistant <a href="J.%20Carter%20Brown">J. Carter Brown</a> (who became gallery director in 1969) to find an architect. The new structure would be located to the east of the original building, and tasked with two functions: offer a large space for public appreciation of various popular collections; and house office space as well as archives for scholarship and research. They likened the scope of the new facility to the <a href="Library%20of%20Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a>. After inspecting Pei's work at the <a href="Des%20Moines%20Art%20Center">Des Moines Art Center</a> in Iowa and the <a href="Herbert%20F.%20Johnson%20Museum%20of%20Art">Johnson Museum</a> at <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a>, they offered him the commission.

Pei took to the project with vigor, and set to work with two young architects he had recently recruited to the firm, William Pedersen and <a href="Yann%20Weymouth">Yann Weymouth</a>. Their first obstacle was the unusual shape of the building site, a <a href="trapezoid">trapezoid</a> of land at the intersection of <a href="Constitution%20Avenue">Constitution</a> and <a href="Pennsylvania%20Avenue%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29">Pennsylvania Avenues</a>. Inspiration struck Pei in 1968, when he scrawled a rough diagram of two triangles on a scrap of paper. The larger building would be the public gallery; the smaller would house offices and archives. This triangular shape became a singular vision for the architect. As the date for groundbreaking approached, Pedersen suggested to his boss that a slightly different approach would make construction easier. Pei simply smiled and said: "No compromises."

The growing popularity of art museums presented unique challenges to the architecture. Mellon and Pei both expected large crowds of people to visit the new building, and they planned accordingly. To this end, he designed a large lobby roofed with enormous skylights. Individual galleries are located along the periphery, allowing visitors to return after viewing each exhibit to the spacious main room. A large <a href="Mobile%20%28sculpture%29">mobile sculpture</a> by American artist <a href="Alexander%20Calder">Alexander Calder</a> was later added to the lobby. Pei hoped the lobby would be exciting to the public in the same way as the central room of the <a href="Solomon%20R.%20Guggenheim%20Museum">Guggenheim Museum</a> in New York. The modern museum, he said later, "must pay greater attention to its educational responsibility, especially to the young".

Materials for the building's exterior were chosen with careful precision. To match the look and texture of the original gallery's marble walls, builders re-opened the quarry in <a href="Knoxville%2C%20Tennessee">Knoxville, Tennessee</a>, from which the first batch of stone had been harvested. The project even found and hired Malcolm Rice, a quarry supervisor who had overseen the original 1941 gallery project. The marble was cut into three-inch-thick blocks and arranged over the concrete foundation, with darker blocks at the bottom and lighter blocks on top.

The East Building was honored on 30 May 1978, two days before its public unveiling, with a black-tie party attended by celebrities, politicians, benefactors, and artists. When the building opened, popular opinion was enthusiastic. Large crowds visited the new museum, and critics generally voiced their approval. <a href="Ada%20Louise%20Huxtable">Ada Louise Huxtable</a> wrote in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" that Pei's building was "a palatial statement of the creative accommodation of contemporary art and architecture". The sharp angle of the smaller building has been a particular note of praise for the public; over the years it has become stained and worn from the hands of visitors.

Some critics disliked the unusual design, however, and criticized the reliance on triangles throughout the building. Others took issue with the large main lobby, particularly its attempt to lure casual visitors. In his review for "<a href="Artforum">Artforum</a>", critic Richard Hennessy described a "shocking fun-house atmosphere" and "aura of ancient Roman patronage". One of the earliest and most vocal critics, however, came to appreciate the new gallery once he saw it in person. Allan Greenberg had scorned the design when it was first unveiled, but wrote later to J. Carter Brown: "I am forced to admit that you are right and I was wrong! The building is a masterpiece."
After US President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> made his famous <a href="1972%20Nixon%20visit%20to%20China">1972 visit to China</a>, a wave of exchanges took place between the two countries. One of these was a delegation of the <a href="American%20Institute%20of%20Architects">American Institute of Architects</a> in 1974, which Pei joined. It was his first trip back to China since leaving in 1935. He was favorably received, returned the welcome with positive comments, and a series of lectures ensued. Pei noted in one lecture that since the 1950s Chinese architects had been content to imitate Western styles; he urged his audience in one lecture to search China's native traditions for inspiration.

In 1978, Pei was asked to initiate a project for his home country. After surveying a number of different locations, Pei fell in love with a valley that had once served as an imperial garden and hunting preserve known as <a href="Fragrant%20Hills">Fragrant Hills</a>. The site housed a decrepit hotel; Pei was invited to tear it down and build a new one. As usual, he approached the project by carefully considering the context and purpose. Likewise, he considered modernist styles inappropriate for the setting. Thus, he said, it was necessary to find "a third way".

After visiting his ancestral home in Suzhou, Pei created a design based on some simple but nuanced techniques he admired in traditional residential Chinese buildings. Among these were abundant gardens, integration with nature, and consideration of the relationship between enclosure and opening. Pei's design included a large central atrium covered by glass panels that functioned much like the large central space in his East Building of the National Gallery. Openings of various shapes in walls invited guests to view the natural scenery beyond. Younger Chinese who had hoped the building would exhibit some of Cubist flavor for which Pei had become known were disappointed, but the new hotel found more favour with government officials and architects.

The hotel, with 325 guest rooms and a four-story central atrium, was designed to fit perfectly into its natural habitat. The trees in the area were of special concern, and particular care was taken to cut down as few as possible. He worked with an expert from Suzhou to preserve and renovate a water maze from the original hotel, one of only five in the country. Pei was also meticulous about the arrangement of items in the garden behind the hotel; he even insisted on transporting of rocks from a location in southwest China to suit the natural aesthetic. An associate of Pei's said later that he never saw the architect so involved in a project.

During construction, a series of mistakes collided with the nation's lack of technology to strain relations between architects and builders. Whereas 200 or so workers might have been used for a similar building in the US, the Fragrant Hill project employed over 3,000 workers. This was mostly because the construction company lacked the sophisticated machines used in other parts of the world. The problems continued for months, until Pei had an uncharacteristically emotional moment during a meeting with Chinese officials. He later explained that his actions included "shouting and pounding the table" in frustration. The design staff noticed a difference in the manner of work among the crew after the meeting. As the opening neared, however, Pei found the hotel still needed work. He began scrubbing floors with his wife and ordered his children to make beds and vacuum floors. The project's difficulties took an emotional and physical strain on the Pei family.

The Fragrant Hill Hotel opened on 17 October 1982 but quickly fell into disrepair. A member of Pei's staff returned for a visit several years later and confirmed the dilapidated condition of the hotel. He and Pei attributed this to the country's general unfamiliarity with deluxe buildings. The Chinese architectural community at the time gave the structure little attention, as their interest at the time centered on the work of American <a href="postmodern%20architecture">postmodernists</a> such as <a href="Michael%20Graves">Michael Graves</a>.

As the Fragrant Hill project neared completion, Pei began work on the <a href="Jacob%20K.%20Javits%20Convention%20Center">Jacob K. Javits Convention Center</a> in New York City, for which his associate <a href="James%20Ingo%20Freed">James Freed</a> served as lead designer. Hoping to create a vibrant community institution in what was then a run-down neighborhood on Manhattan's west side, Freed developed a glass-coated structure with an intricate <a href="space%20frame">space frame</a> of interconnected metal rods and spheres.

The convention center was plagued from the start by budget problems and construction blunders. City regulations forbid a general contractor having final authority over the project, so architects and program manager Richard Kahan had to coordinate the wide array of builders, plumbers, electricians, and other workers. The forged steel globes to be used in the space frame came to the site with hairline cracks and other defects; 12,000 were rejected. These and other problems led to media comparisons with the disastrous Hancock Tower. One New York City official blamed Kahan for the difficulties, indicating that the building's architectural flourishes were responsible for delays and financial crises. The Javits Center opened on 3 April 1986, to a generally positive reception. During the inauguration ceremonies, however, neither Freed nor Pei was recognized for their role in the project.

When <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mitterrand">François Mitterrand</a> was elected President of France in 1981, he laid out an ambitious plan for a variety of construction projects. One of these was the renovation of the Louvre Museum. Mitterrand appointed a civil servant named to oversee it. After visiting museums in Europe and the United States, including the US National Gallery, he asked Pei to join the team. The architect made three secretive trips to Paris, to determine the feasibility of the project; only one museum employee knew why he was there. Pei finally agreed that a reconstruction project was not only possible, but necessary for the future of the museum. He thus became the first foreign architect to work on the Louvre.

The heart of the new design included not only a renovation of the "Cour Napoléon" in the midst of the buildings, but also a transformation of the interiors. Pei proposed a central entrance, not unlike the lobby of the National Gallery East Building, which would link the three major buildings. Below would be a complex of additional floors for research, storage, and maintenance purposes. At the center of the courtyard he designed a <a href="Louvre%20Pyramid">glass and steel pyramid</a>, first proposed with the Kennedy Library, to serve as entrance and anteroom skylight. It was mirrored by <a href="La%20Pyramide%20Invers%C3%A9e">another inverted pyramid</a> underneath, to reflect sunlight into the room. These designs were partly an homage to the fastidious geometry of the famous French landscape architect <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Le%20N%C3%B4tre">André Le Nôtre</a> (1613–1700). Pei also found the pyramid shape best suited for stable transparency, and considered it "most compatible with the architecture of the Louvre, especially with the faceted planes of its roofs".

Biasini and Mitterrand liked the plans, but the scope of the renovation displeased Louvre director André Chabaud. He resigned from his post, complaining that the project was "unfeasible" and posed "architectural risks". The public also reacted harshly to the design, mostly because of the proposed pyramid. One critic called it a "gigantic, ruinous gadget"; another charged Mitterrand with "despotism" for inflicting Paris with the "atrocity". Pei estimated that 90 percent of Parisians opposed his design. "I received many angry glances in the streets of Paris," he said. Some condemnations carried <a href="nationalism">nationalistic</a> overtones. One opponent wrote: "I am surprised that one would go looking for a Chinese architect in America to deal with the historic heart of the capital of France."
Soon, however, Pei and his team won the support of several key cultural icons, including the conductor <a href="Pierre%20Boulez">Pierre Boulez</a> and <a href="Claude%20Pompidou">Claude Pompidou</a>, widow of former French President <a href="Georges%20Pompidou">Georges Pompidou</a>, after whom <a href="Centre%20Georges%20Pompidou">another controversial museum</a> was named. In an attempt to soothe public ire, Pei took a suggestion from then-mayor of Paris <a href="Jacques%20Chirac">Jacques Chirac</a> and placed a full-sized cable model of the pyramid in the courtyard. During the four days of its exhibition, an estimated 60,000 people visited the site. Some critics eased their opposition after witnessing the proposed scale of the pyramid.

To minimize the impact of the structure, Pei demanded a method of glass production that resulted in clear panes. The pyramid was constructed at the same time as the subterranean levels below, which caused difficulties during the building stages. As they worked, construction teams came upon an abandoned set of rooms containing 25,000 historical items; these were incorporated into the rest of the structure to add a new exhibition zone.
The new Louvre courtyard was opened to the public on 14 October 1988, and the Pyramid entrance was opened the following March. By this time, public opinion had softened on the new installation; a poll found a fifty-six percent approval rating for the pyramid, with twenty-three percent still opposed. The newspaper "<a href="Le%20Figaro">Le Figaro</a>" had vehemently criticized Pei's design, but later celebrated the tenth anniversary of its magazine supplement at the pyramid. <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Charles</a> of Britain surveyed the new site with curiosity, and declared it "marvelous, very exciting". A writer in "<a href="Le%20Quotidien%20de%20Paris">Le Quotidien de Paris</a>" wrote: "The much-feared pyramid has become adorable." The experience was exhausting for Pei, but also rewarding. "After the Louvre," he said later, "I thought no project would be too difficult." The "<a href="Louvre%20Pyramid">Louvre Pyramid</a>" has become Pei's most famous structure.

The opening of the Louvre Pyramid coincided with four other projects on which Pei had been working, prompting architecture critic <a href="Paul%20Goldberger">Paul Goldberger</a> to declare 1989 "the year of Pei" in "The New York Times". It was also the year in which Pei's firm changed its name to <a href="Pei%20Cobb%20Freed%20%26amp%3B%20Partners">Pei Cobb Freed & Partners</a>, to reflect the increasing stature and prominence of his associates. At the age of seventy-two, Pei had begun thinking about retirement, but continued working long hours to see his designs come to light.
One of the projects took Pei back to Dallas, Texas, to design the <a href="Morton%20H.%20Meyerson%20Symphony%20Center">Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center</a>. The success of city's performing artists, particularly the <a href="Dallas%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Dallas Symphony Orchestra</a> then being led by conductor <a href="Eduardo%20Mata">Eduardo Mata</a>, led to interest by city leaders in creating a modern center for musical arts that could rival the best halls in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>. The organizing committee contacted 45 architects, but at first Pei did not respond, thinking that his work on the Dallas City Hall had left a negative impression. One of his colleagues from that project, however, insisted that he meet with the committee. He did and, although it would be his first concert hall, the committee voted unanimously to offer him the commission. As one member put it: "We were convinced that we would get the world's greatest architect putting his best foot forward."

The project presented a variety of specific challenges. Because its main purpose was the presentation of live music, the hall needed a design focused on <a href="acoustics">acoustics</a> first, then public access and exterior aesthetics. To this end, a professional sound technician was hired to design the interior. He proposed a <a href="Shoebox%20style%20%28architecture%29">shoebox</a> auditorium, used in the acclaimed designs of top European symphony halls such as the <a href="Concertgebouw">Amsterdam Concertgebouw</a> and <a href="Musikverein">Vienna Musikverein</a>. Pei drew inspiration for his adjustments from the designs of the German architect <a href="Johann%20Balthasar%20Neumann">Johann Balthasar Neumann</a>, especially the <a href="Basilica%20of%20the%20Fourteen%20Holy%20Helpers">Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers</a>. He also sought to incorporate some of the panache of the <a href="Palais%20Garnier">Paris Opéra</a> designed by <a href="Charles%20Garnier%20%28architect%29">Charles Garnier</a>.

Pei's design placed the rigid shoebox at an angle to the surrounding street grid, connected at the north end to a long rectangular office building, and cut through the middle with an assortment of circles and cones. The design attempted to reproduce with modern features the acoustic and visual functions of traditional elements like <a href="filigree">filigree</a>. The project was risky: its goals were ambitious and any unforeseen acoustic flaws would be virtually impossible to remedy after the hall's completion. Pei admitted that he did not completely know how everything would come together. "I can imagine only 60 percent of the space in this building," he said during the early stages. "The rest will be as surprising to me as to everyone else." As the project developed, costs rose steadily and some sponsors considered withdrawing their support. Billionaire tycoon <a href="Ross%20Perot">Ross Perot</a> made a donation of US$10 million, on the condition that it be named in honor of Morton H. Meyerson, the longtime patron of the arts in Dallas.

The building opened and immediately garnered widespread praise, especially for its acoustics. After attending a week of performances in the hall, a music critic for "The New York Times" wrote an enthusiastic account of the experience and congratulated the architects. One of Pei's associates told him during a party before the opening that the symphony hall was "a very mature building"; he smiled and replied: "Ah, but did I have to wait this long?"

A new offer had arrived for Pei from the Chinese government in 1982. With an eye toward the <a href="transfer%20of%20sovereignty%20of%20Hong%20Kong">transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong</a> from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the <a href="Bank%20of%20China">Bank of China</a>. The Chinese government was preparing for a new wave of engagement with the outside world and sought a tower to represent modernity and economic strength. Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement. Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal. Although the architect remained pained by his experience with Fragrant Hill, he agreed to accept the commission.

The proposed site in Hong Kong's <a href="Central%2C%20Hong%20Kong">Central District</a> was less than ideal; a tangle of highways lined it on three sides. The area had also been home to a headquarters for Japanese military police during World War II, and was notorious for prisoner torture. The small parcel of land made a tall tower necessary, and Pei had usually shied away from such projects; in Hong Kong especially, the skyscrapers lacked any real architectural character. Lacking inspiration and unsure of how to approach the building, Pei took a weekend vacation to the family home in <a href="Katonah%2C%20New%20York">Katonah, New York</a>. There he found himself experimenting with a bundle of sticks until he happened upon a cascading sequence.

Pei felt that his design for the <a href="Bank%20of%20China%20Tower%2C%20Hong%20Kong">Bank of China Tower</a> needed to reflect "the aspirations of the Chinese people". The design that he developed for the skyscraper was not only unique in appearance, but also sound enough to pass the city's rigorous standards for wind-resistance. The tower was planned around a visible <a href="truss">truss</a> structure, which distributed stress to the four corners of the base. Using the reflective glass that had become something of a trademark for him, Pei organized the facade around a series of boxed X shapes. At the top, he designed the roofs at sloping angles to match the rising aesthetic of the building. Some influential advocates of "<a href="feng%20shui">feng shui</a>" in Hong Kong and China criticized the design, and Pei and government officials responded with token adjustments. 

As the tower neared completion, Pei was shocked to witness the government's massacre of unarmed civilians at the <a href="Tiananmen%20Square%20protests%20of%201989">Tiananmen Square protests of 1989</a>. He wrote an opinion piece for "The New York Times" titled "China Won't Ever Be the Same", in which he said that the killings "tore the heart out of a generation that carries the hope for the future of the country". The massacre deeply disturbed his entire family, and he wrote that "China is besmirched."

As the 1990s began, Pei transitioned into a role of decreased involvement with his firm. The staff had begun to shrink, and Pei wanted to dedicate himself to smaller projects allowing for more creativity. Before he made this change, however, he set to work on his last major project as active partner: The <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in Cleveland, Ohio. Considering his work on such bastions of <a href="high%20culture">high culture</a> as the Louvre and US National Gallery, some critics were surprised by his association with what many considered a tribute to <a href="low%20culture">low culture</a>. The sponsors of the hall, however, sought Pei for specifically this reason; they wanted the building to have an aura of respectability from the beginning. As in the past, Pei accepted the commission in part because of the unique challenge it presented.

Using a glass wall for the entrance, similar in appearance to his Louvre pyramid, Pei coated the exterior of the main building in white metal, and placed a large cylinder on a narrow perch to serve as a performance space. The combination of off-centered wraparounds and angled walls was, Pei said, designed to provide "a sense of tumultuous youthful energy, rebelling, flailing about".

The building opened in 1995, and was received with moderate praise. "The New York Times" called it "a fine building", but Pei was among those who felt disappointed with the results. The museum's early beginnings in New York combined with an unclear mission created a fuzzy understanding among project leaders for precisely what was needed. Although the city of Cleveland benefited greatly from the new tourist attraction, Pei was unhappy with it.

At the same time, Pei designed a new museum for <a href="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>, the "Musée d'art moderne Grand-Duc Jean", commonly known as the <a href="Mudam">Mudam</a>. Drawing from the original shape of the <a href="Fort%20Th%C3%BCngen">Fort Thüngen</a> walls where the museum was located, Pei planned to remove a portion of the original foundation. Public resistance to the historical loss forced a revision of his plan, however, and the project was nearly abandoned. The size of the building was halved, and it was set back from the original wall segments to preserve the foundation. Pei was disappointed with the alterations, but remained involved in the building process even during construction.

In 1995, Pei was hired to design an extension to the "<a href="Deutsches%20Historisches%20Museum">Deutsches Historisches Museum</a>", or German Historical Museum in Berlin. Returning to the challenge of the East Building of the US National Gallery, Pei worked to combine a modernist approach with a classical main structure. He described the glass cylinder addition as a "beacon", and topped it with a glass roof to allow plentiful sunlight inside. Pei had difficulty working with German government officials on the project; their utilitarian approach clashed with his passion for aesthetics. "They thought I was nothing but trouble", he said.

Pei also worked at this time on two projects for a <a href="Japanese%20new%20religions">new Japanese religious movement</a> called "<a href="Shinji%20Shumeikai">Shinji Shumeikai</a>". He was approached by the movement's spiritual leader, Kaishu Koyama, who impressed the architect with her sincerity and willingness to give him significant artistic freedom. One of the buildings was a bell tower, designed to resemble the "<a href="bachi">bachi</a>" used when playing traditional instruments like the "<a href="shamisen">shamisen</a>". Pei was unfamiliar with the movement's beliefs, but explored them in order to represent something meaningful in the tower. As he said: "It was a search for the sort of expression that is not at all technical."
The experience was rewarding for Pei, and he agreed immediately to work with the group again. The new project was the <a href="Miho%20Museum">Miho Museum</a>, to display Koyama's collection of <a href="Japanese%20tea%20ceremony">tea ceremony</a> artifacts. Pei visited the site in <a href="Shiga%20Prefecture">Shiga Prefecture</a>, and during their conversations convinced Koyama to expand her collection. She conducted a global search and acquired more than 300 items showcasing the history of the <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a>.

One major challenge was the approach to the museum. The Japanese team proposed a winding road up the mountain, not unlike the approach to the NCAR building in Colorado. Instead, Pei ordered a hole cut through a nearby mountain, connected to a major road via a bridge suspended from ninety-six steel cables and supported by a post set into the mountain. The museum itself was built into the mountain, with 80 percent of the building underground.

When designing the exterior, Pei borrowed from the tradition of Japanese temples, particularly those found in nearby <a href="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>. He created a concise spaceframe wrapped into French limestone and covered with a glass roof. Pei also oversaw specific decorative details, including a bench in the entrance lobby, carved from a 350-year-old "<a href="Zelkova%20serrata">keyaki</a>" tree. Because of Koyama's considerable wealth, money was rarely considered an obstacle; estimates at the time of completion put the cost of the project at US$350 million.

During the first decade of the 2000s, Pei designed a variety of buildings, including the <a href="Suzhou%20Museum">Suzhou Museum</a> near his childhood home. He also designed the <a href="Museum%20of%20Islamic%20Art%2C%20Doha">Museum of Islamic Art</a> in <a href="Doha">Doha</a>, <a href="Qatar">Qatar</a> at the request of <a href="Collecting%20practices%20of%20the%20Al-Thani%20Family">the Al-Thani Family</a>. Although it was originally planned for the <a href="corniche">corniche</a> road along Doha Bay, Pei convinced project coordinators to build a new island to provide the needed space. He then spent six months touring the region and surveying mosques in Spain, Syria, and Tunisia. He was especially impressed with the elegant simplicity of the <a href="Mosque%20of%20Ibn%20Tulun">Mosque of Ibn Tulun</a> in Cairo.

Once again, Pei sought to combine new design elements with the classical aesthetic most appropriate for the location of the building. The rectangular boxes rotate evenly to create a subtle movement, with small arched windows at regular intervals into the limestone exterior. The museum's coordinators were pleased with the project; its official website describes its "true splendour unveiled in the sunlight", and speaks of "the shades of colour and the interplay of shadows paying tribute to the essence of Islamic architecture".
The <a href="Macao%20Science%20Center">Macao Science Center</a> in <a href="Macau">Macau</a> was designed by <a href="Pei%20Partnership%20Architects">Pei Partnership Architects</a> in association with I. M. Pei. The project to build the science center was conceived in 2001 and construction started in 2006. The center was completed in 2009 and opened by the Chinese President <a href="Hu%20Jintao">Hu Jintao</a>.
The main part of the building is a distinctive conical shape with a spiral walkway and large atrium inside, similar to the <a href="Solomon%20R.%20Guggenheim%20Museum">Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>. Galleries lead off the walkway, mainly consisting of interactive exhibits aimed at science education.
The building is in a prominent position by the sea and is now a landmark of Macau.

Pei's style is described as thoroughly <a href="modern%20architecture">modernist</a>, with significant <a href="cubism">cubist</a> themes. He is known for combining traditional architectural elements with progressive designs based on simple geometric patterns. As one critic writes: "Pei has been aptly described as combining a classical sense of form with a contemporary mastery of method." In 2000, biographer Carter Wiseman called Pei "the most distinguished member of his Late-Modernist generation still in practice". At the same time, Pei himself rejects simple dichotomies of architectural trends. He once said: "The talk about modernism versus <a href="postmodern%20architecture">post-modernism</a> is unimportant. It's a side issue. An individual building, the style in which it is going to be designed and built, is not that important. The important thing, really, is the community. How does it affect life?"

Pei's work is celebrated throughout the world of architecture. His colleague <a href="John%20Portman">John Portman</a> once told him: "Just once, I'd like to do something like the <a href="East%20Building">East Building</a>." But this originality does not always bring large financial reward; as Pei replied to the successful architect: "Just once, I'd like to make the kind of money you do." His concepts, moreover, are too individualized and dependent on context to give rise to a particular school of design. Pei refers to his own "analytical approach" when explaining the lack of a "Pei School". "For me," he said, "the important distinction is between a stylistic approach to the design; and an analytical approach giving the process of due consideration to time, place, and purpose ... My analytical approach requires a full understanding of the three essential elements ... to arrive at an ideal balance among them."

In the words of his biographer, Pei has won "every award of any consequence in his art", including the Arnold Brunner Award from the <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Arts%20and%20Letters">National Institute of Arts and Letters</a> (1963), the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Letters%20Gold%20Medals">Gold Medal</a> for Architecture from the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Letters">American Academy of Arts and Letters</a> (1979), the <a href="AIA%20Gold%20Medal">AIA Gold Medal</a> (1979), the first "<a href="Praemium%20Imperiale">Praemium Imperiale</a>" for Architecture from the Japan Art Association (1989), the Lifetime Achievement Award from the <a href="Cooper-Hewitt%2C%20National%20Design%20Museum">Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum</a>, the 1998 <a href="Edward%20MacDowell%20Medal">Edward MacDowell Medal</a> in the Arts, and the 2010 <a href="Royal%20Gold%20Medal">Royal Gold Medal</a> from the <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects">Royal Institute of British Architects</a>. In 1983 he was awarded the <a href="Pritzker%20Prize">Pritzker Prize</a>, sometimes called the <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a> of architecture. In its citation, the jury said: "Ieoh Ming Pei has given this century some of its most beautiful interior spaces and exterior forms ... His versatility and skill in the use of materials approach the level of poetry." The prize was accompanied by a US$100,000 award, which Pei used to create a scholarship for Chinese students to study architecture in the US, on the condition that they return to China to work. In being awarded the 2003 <a href="Henry%20C.%20Turner%20Prize">Henry C. Turner Prize</a> by the <a href="National%20Building%20Museum">National Building Museum</a>, museum board chair Carolyn Brody praised his impact on construction innovation: "His magnificent designs have challenged engineers to devise innovative structural solutions, and his exacting expectations for construction quality have encouraged contractors to achieve high standards." In December 1992, Pei was awarded the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> by <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>.

Pei's wife of over seventy years, Eileen Loo, died on 20 June 2014. Together they had three sons, T'ing Chung (1946–2003), Chien Chung (b. 1946) and Li Chung (b. 1949), and a daughter, Liane (b. 1960). T'ing Chung was an <a href="Urban%20planning">urban planner</a> and alumnus of his father's "<a href="alma%20mater">alma mater</a>" MIT and Harvard. Chieng Chung and Li Chung, who are both <a href="Harvard%20Graduate%20School%20of%20Design">Harvard Graduate School of Design</a> alumni, founded and run <a href="Pei%20Partnership%20Architects">Pei Partnership Architects</a>. Liane is a lawyer. Pei celebrated his <a href="centenarian">100th birthday</a> on 26 April 2017.

INS Vikrant (R11)

INS "Vikrant (from <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> "vikrānta", "courageous") was a of the <a href="Indian%20Navy">Indian Navy</a>. The ship was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> as HMS "Hercules for the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, but construction was put on hold when the war ended. India purchased the incomplete carrier in 1957, and construction was completed in 1961. "Vikrant" was <a href="Ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> as the first <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> of the Indian Navy and played a key role in enforcing the <a href="naval%20blockade">naval blockade</a> of <a href="East%20Pakistan">East Pakistan</a> during the <a href="Indo-Pakistani%20War%20of%201971">Indo-Pakistani War of 1971</a>.

In its later years, the ship underwent major refits to embark modern aircraft, before being <a href="Ship%20decommissioning">decommissioned</a> in January 1997. She was preserved as a <a href="museum%20ship">museum ship</a> in <a href="Cuffe%20Parade">Cuffe Parade</a>, <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> until 2012. In January 2014, the ship was sold through an online auction and <a href="Ship%20breaking">scrapped</a> in November 2014 after final clearance from the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20India">Supreme Court</a>.

In 1943 the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> commissioned six <a href="light%20aircraft%20carrier">light aircraft carrier</a>s in an effort to counter the <a href="Kriegsmarine">German</a> and <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Japanese</a> navies. The <a href="1942%20Design%20Light%20Fleet%20Carrier">1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier</a>, commonly referred to as the British Light Fleet Carrier, was the result. Serving with eight navies between 1944 and 2001, these ships were designed and constructed by civilian shipyards as an intermediate step between the full-sized <a href="fleet%20aircraft%20carrier">fleet aircraft carrier</a>s and the less expensive but limited-capability <a href="escort%20carrier">escort carrier</a>s.

Sixteen light fleet carriers were ordered, and all were <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> as what became the "Colossus" class in 1942 and 1943. The final six ships were modified during construction to handle larger and faster aircraft, and were re-designated the "Majestic" class. The improvements from the "Colossus" class to the "Majestic" class included heavier displacement, armament, <a href="Aircraft%20catapult">catapult</a>, <a href="Elevator%23Aircraft%20elevators">aircraft lifts</a> and aircraft capacity. Construction on the ships was suspended at the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, as the ships were surplus to the Royal Navy's peacetime requirements.
Instead, the carriers were modernized and sold to several <a href="Commonwealth%20nations">Commonwealth nations</a>. The ships were similar, but each varied depending on the requirements of the country to which the ship was sold.

HMS "Hercules", the fifth ship in the "Majestic" class, was ordered on 7 August 1942 and laid down on 14 October 1943 by <a href="Vickers-Armstrongs">Vickers-Armstrongs</a> on the <a href="River%20Tyne">River Tyne</a>. After World War II ended with <a href="Japanese%20Instrument%20of%20Surrender">Japan's surrender</a> on 2 September 1945, she was <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 22 September, and her construction was suspended in May 1946. At the time of suspension, she was 75 per cent complete. Her hull was preserved, and in May 1947 she was <a href="%3Awikt%3Alaid%20up">laid up</a> in <a href="Gare%20Loch">Gareloch</a> <a href="Firth%20of%20Clyde">off the Clyde</a>. In January 1957, she was purchased by India and was towed to <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a> to complete her construction and modifications by <a href="Harland%20and%20Wolff">Harland and Wolff</a>. Several improvements to the original design were ordered by the Indian Navy, including an angled deck, <a href="steam%20catapult">steam catapult</a>s, and a modified <a href="Aircraft%20carrier%23Structure">island</a>.

"Vikrant" displaced at <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29%23Standard%20displacement">standard load</a> and at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. She had an <a href="Length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a mean deep <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . She was powered by a pair of <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> <a href="steam%20turbine">geared steam turbine</a>s, driving two propeller shafts, using steam provided by four <a href="Three-drum%20boiler%23Admiralty%20boiler">Admiralty three-drum boiler</a>s. The turbines developed a total of which gave a maximum speed of . "Vikrant" carried about of fuel oil that gave her a range of at , and at . The air and ship crew comprised 1,110 officers and men.

The ship was armed with sixteen <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun">Bofors anti-aircraft gun</a>s, but these were later reduced to eight. At various times, its aircraft consisted of <a href="Hawker%20Sea%20Hawk">Hawker Sea Hawk</a> and <a href="Sea%20Harrier">Sea Harrier</a> (<a href="STOVL">STOVL</a>) <a href="jet%20fighter">jet fighter</a>s, <a href="Westland%20Sea%20King%23India">Sea King Mk 42B</a> and <a href="HAL%20Chetak">HAL Chetak</a> <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a>s, and <a href="Breguet%20Aliz%C3%A9">Breguet Alizé</a> Br.1050 <a href="Anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine aircraft</a>. The carrier fielded between 21 and 23 aircraft of all types. "Vikrant"s <a href="flight%20deck">flight deck</a>s were designed to handle aircraft up to , but remained the heaviest landing weight of an aircraft. Larger lifts were installed.

The ship was equipped with one LW-05 air-search <a href="radar">radar</a>, one ZW-06 surface-search radar, one LW-10 tactical radar and one Type 963 aircraft landing radar with other communication systems.

The Indian Navy's first aircraft carrier was <a href="Ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> as INS "Vikrant" on 4 March 1961 in Belfast by <a href="Vijaya%20Lakshmi%20Pandit">Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20High%20Commissioners%20of%20India%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Indian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom</a>. The name "Vikrant" was derived from the <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> word "vikrānta" meaning "stepping beyond", "courageous" or "bold". Captain Pritam Singh was the first commanding officer of the ship, which carried British Hawker Sea Hawk fighter-bombers and French Alizé anti-submarine aircraft. On 18 May 1961, the first jet landed on her deck. It was piloted by Lieutenant <a href="Radhakrishna%20Hariram%20Tahiliani">Radhakrishna Hariram Tahiliani</a>, who later served as admiral and <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Naval%20Staff%20%28India%29">Chief of the Naval Staff of India</a> from 1984 to 1987. "Vikrant" formally joined the Indian Navy's fleet in Bombay (now <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>) on 3 November 1961, when she was received at <a href="Ballard%20Pier">Ballard Pier</a> by then <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20India">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>.

In December of that year, the ship was deployed for <a href="Annexation%20of%20Portuguese%20India">Operation Vijay</a> (the code name for the annexation of <a href="Portuguese%20India">Portuguese India</a>) off the coast of Goa with two <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s, and . "Vikrant" did not see action, and patrolled along the coast to deter foreign interference. During the <a href="Indo-Pakistani%20War%20of%201965">Indo-Pakistani War of 1965</a>, "Vikrant" was in <a href="dry%20dock">dry dock</a> refitting, and did not see any action.

In June 1970, "Vikrant" was docked at the <a href="Naval%20Dockyard%20%28Mumbai%29">Naval Dockyard</a>, Bombay, due to many internal <a href="Fatigue%20%28material%29">fatigue cracks</a> and fissures in the water drums of her boilers that could not be repaired by welding. As replacement drums were not available locally, four new ones were ordered from Britain, and Naval Headquarters issued orders not to use the boilers until further notice. On 26 February 1971 the ship was moved from Ballard Pier Extension to the anchorage, without replacement drums. The main objective behind this move was to light up the boilers at reduced pressure, and work up the main and flight deck machinery that had been idle for almost seven months. On 1 March, the boilers were ignited, and basin trials up to 40 revolutions per minute (RPM) were conducted. Catapult trials were conducted on the same day.

The ship began preliminary <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s on 18 March and returned two days later. Trials were again conducted on 26–27 April. The navy decided to limit the boilers to a pressure of and the propeller revolutions to 120 RPM ahead and 80 RPM astern, reducing the ship's speed to . With the growing expectations of a <a href="Indo-Pakistani%20wars%20and%20conflicts">war with Pakistan</a> in the near future, the navy started to transfer its ships to strategically advantageous locations in Indian waters. The primary concern of Naval Headquarters about the operation was the serviceability of "Vikrant". When asked his opinion regarding the involvement of "Vikrant" in the war, Fleet Operations Officer Captain <a href="Gulab%20Mohanlal%20Hiranandani">Gulab Mohanlal Hiranandani</a> told the Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral <a href="S.%20M.%20Nanda">Sardarilal Mathradas Nanda</a>:

Nanda and Hiranandani proved to be instrumental in taking "Vikrant" to war. There were objections that the ship might have severe operational difficulties that would expose the carrier to increased danger on operations. In addition, the three s acquired by the <a href="Pakistan%20Navy">Pakistan Navy</a> posed a significant risk to the carrier. In June, extensive deep sea trials were carried out, with steel safety harnesses around the three boilers still operational. Observation windows were fitted as a precautionary measure, to detect any steam leaks. By the end of June, the trials were complete and "Vikrant" was cleared to participate on operations, with its speed restricted to 14 <a href="Knot%20%28unit%29">knots</a>.

As a part of preparations for the war, "Vikrant" was assigned to the <a href="Eastern%20Naval%20Command">Eastern Naval Command</a>, then to the Eastern Fleet. This fleet consisted of INS "Vikrant", the two s and , the two <a href="Arnala-class%20corvette">Petya III-class</a> <a href="corvette">corvette</a>s and , and one submarine, . The main reason behind strengthening the Eastern Fleet was to counter the Pakistani maritime forces deployed in support of military operations in <a href="East%20Bengal">East Bengal</a>. A surveillance area of , confined by a triangle with a base of and sides of and , was set up in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a>. Any ship in this area was to be challenged and checked. If found to be neutral, it would be escorted to the nearest Indian port, otherwise, it would be captured, and taken as a <a href="war%20prize">war prize</a>.

In the meantime, intelligence reports confirmed that Pakistan was to deploy a US-built , . "Ghazi" was considered as a serious threat to "Vikrant" by the Indian Navy, as "Vikrant"s approximate position would be known by the Pakistanis once she started operating aircraft. Of the four available surface ships, INS "Kavaratti" had no <a href="sonar">sonar</a>, which meant that the other three had to remain in close vicinity of "Vikrant", without which the carrier would be completely vulnerable to attack by "Ghazi".

On 23 July, "Vikrant" sailed off to <a href="Cochin">Cochin</a> in company with the Western Fleet. En route, before reaching Cochin on 26 July, Sea King landing trials were carried out. After the completion of the radar and communication trials on 28 July, she departed for <a href="Madras">Madras</a>, escorted by "Brahmaputra" and "Beas". The next major problem was operating aircraft from the carrier. The commanding officer of the ship, Captain (later Vice Admiral) S. Prakash, was seriously concerned about flight operations. He was concerned that aircrew morale would be adversely affected if flight operations were not undertaken, which could be disastrous. Naval Headquarters remained stubborn on the speed restrictions, and sought confirmation from Prakash whether it was possible to embark an Alizé without compromising the speed restrictions. The speed restrictions imposed by the headquarters meant that Alizé aircraft would have to land at close to <a href="Stall%20%28engine%29">stalling</a> speed. Eventually the aircraft weight was reduced, which allowed several of the aircraft to embark, along with a Seahawk squadron.

By the end of September, "Vikrant" and her escorts reached <a href="Port%20Blair">Port Blair</a>. En route to <a href="Visakhapatnam">Visakhapatnam</a>, tactical exercises were conducted in the presence of the Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Eastern Naval Command. From Vishakhapatnam, "Vikrant" set out for Madras for maintenance. Rear Admiral S. H. Sharma was appointed Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet and arrived at Vishakhapatnam on 14 October. After receiving the reports that Pakistan might launch preemptive strikes, maintenance was stopped for another tactical exercise, which was completed during the night of 26–27 October at Vishakhapatnam. "Vikrant" then returned to Madras to resume maintenance. On 1 November, the Eastern Fleet was formally constituted, and on 13 November, all the ships set out for the <a href="Andaman%20and%20Nicobar%20Islands">Andaman and Nicobar Islands</a>. To avoid misadventures, it was planned to sail "Vikrant" to a remote anchorage, isolating it from combat. Simultaneously, deception signals would give the impression that "Vikrant" was operating somewhere between Madras and Vishakhapatnam.

On 23 November, an emergency was declared in Pakistan after a clash of Indian and Pakistani troops in <a href="East%20Pakistan">East Pakistan</a> two days earlier. On 2 December, the Eastern Fleet proceeded to its patrol area in anticipation of an attack by Pakistan. The Pakistan Navy had deployed "Ghazi" on 14 November with the explicit goal of targeting and sinking "Vikrant", and "Ghazi" reached a location near Madras by the 23rd. In an attempt to deceive the Pakistan Navy and "Ghazi", India's Naval Headquarters deployed "Rajput" as a decoy—the ship sailed off the coast of Vishakhapatnam and broadcast a significant amount of radio traffic, making her appear to be "Vikrant".

"Ghazi", meanwhile, sank off the Visakhapatnam coast under mysterious circumstances. On the night of 3–4 December, a muffled underwater explosion was detected by a coastal battery. The next morning, a local fisherman observed flotsam near the coast, causing Indian naval officials to suspect a vessel had sunk off the coast. The next day, a <a href="clearance%20diver">clearance diving team</a> was sent to search the area, and they confirmed that "Ghazi" had sunk in shallow waters.

The reason for "Ghazi"s fate is unclear. The Indian Navy's official historian, Hiranandani, suggests three possibilities, after having analysed the position of the rudder and extent of the damage suffered. The first was that "Ghazi" had come up to <a href="Periscope%23Naval%20use">periscope depth</a> to identify her position and may have seen an anti-submarine vessel that caused her to <a href="crash%20dive">crash dive</a>, which in turn may have led her to bury her bow in the bottom. The second possibility is closely related to the first: on the night of the explosion, "Rajput" was on patrol off Visakhapatnam and observed a severe disturbance in the water. Suspecting that it was a submarine, the ship dropped two <a href="depth%20charge">depth charge</a>s on the spot, on a position that was very close to the wreckage. The third possibility is that there was a mishap when "Ghazi" was laying <a href="Naval%20mine">mines</a> on the day before hostilities broke out.

"Vikrant" was redeployed towards <a href="Chittagong">Chittagong</a> at the outbreak of hostilities. On 4 December, the ship's Sea Hawks struck shipping in Chittagong and <a href="Cox%27s%20Bazar">Cox's Bazar</a> harbours, sinking or incapacitating most of the ships present. Later strikes targeted <a href="Khulna">Khulna</a> and the <a href="Port%20of%20Mongla">Port of Mongla</a>, which continued until 10 December, while other operations were flown to support a naval blockade of East Pakistan. On 14 December, the Sea Hawks attacked the <a href="cantonment">cantonment</a> area in Chittagong, destroying several Pakistani army barracks. Medium anti-aircraft fire was encountered during this strike. Simultaneous attacks by Alizés continued on Cox's Bazar. After this, "Vikrant"s fuel levels dropped to less than 25 per cent, and the aircraft carrier sailed to <a href="Paradip">Paradip</a> for refueling. The crew of INS "Vikrant" earned two <a href="Maha%20Vir%20Chakra">Maha Vir Chakra</a>s and twelve <a href="Vir%20Chakra">Vir Chakra</a> gallantry medals for their part in the war.

"Vikrant" did not see much service after the war, and was given two major modernisation <a href="refit">refit</a>s—the first one from 1979 to 1981 and the second one from 1987 to 1989. In the first phase, her boilers, radars, communication systems and anti-aircraft guns were modernised, and facilities to operate Sea Harriers were installed. In the second phase, facilities to operate the new Sea Harrier Vertical/Short Take Off and Land (V/STOL) fighter aircraft and the new Sea King Mk 42B Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) helicopters were introduced. A 9.75-degree <a href="Aircraft%20ski-jump">ski-jump ramp</a> was fitted. The <a href="steam%20catapult">steam catapult</a> was removed during this phase. Again in 1991, "Vikrant" underwent a six-month refit, followed by another fourteen-month refit in 1992–94. She remained operational thereafter, flying Sea Harriers, Sea Kings and Chetaks until her final sea outing on 23 November 1994. In the same year, a fire was also recorded aboard. In January 1995, the navy decided to keep "Vikrant" in "safe to float" state. She was <a href="laid%20up">laid up</a> and formally decommissioned on 31 January 1997.

During her service, INS "Vikrant" embarked four squadrons of the Naval Air Arm of the Indian Navy:

Following decommissioning in 1997, the ship was earmarked for preservation as a <a href="museum%20ship">museum ship</a> in Mumbai. Lack of funding prevented progress on the ship's conversion to a museum and it was speculated that the ship would be made into a training ship. In 2001, the ship was opened to the public by the Indian Navy, but the <a href="Government%20of%20Maharashtra">Government of Maharashtra</a> was unable to find a partner to operate the museum on a permanent, long-term basis and the museum was closed after it was deemed unsafe for the public in 2012.

In August 2013, Vice-Admiral Shekhar Sinha, chief of the <a href="Western%20Naval%20Command">Western Naval Command</a>, said the Ministry of Defence would scrap the ship as she had become very difficult to maintain and no private bidders had offered to fund the museum's operations. On 3 December 2013, the Indian government decided to auction the ship. The <a href="Bombay%20High%20Court">Bombay High Court</a> dismissed a public-interest lawsuit filed by Kiran Paigankar to stop the auction, stating the vessel's dilapidated condition did not warrant her preservation, nor were the necessary funds or government support available.

In January 2014, the ship was sold through an online auction to a Darukhana <a href="Ship%20breaking">ship-breaker</a> for . The <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20India">Supreme Court of India</a> dismissed another lawsuit challenging the ship's sale and scrapping on 14 August 2014. "Vikrant" remained beached off Darukhana in Mumbai Port while awaiting the final clearances of the Mumbai Port Trust. On 12 November 2014, the Supreme Court gave its final approval for the carrier to be scrapped, which commenced on 22 November 2014.

In memory of "Vikrant", the Vikrant Memorial was unveiled by Vice Admiral <a href="Surinder%20Pal%20Singh%20Cheema">Surinder Pal Singh Cheema</a>, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Western Naval Command at K Subash Marg in the Naval Dockyard of Mumbai on 25 January 2016. The memorial is made from metal recovered from the ship.
In February 2016, <a href="Bajaj%20Auto">Bajaj</a> unveiled a new motorbike made with metal from "Vikrant"s scrap and named it Bajaj V in honour of "Vikrant".

The navy has named its first home-built carrier <a href="INS%20Vikrant%20%282013%29">INS "Vikrant"</a> in honour of INS "Vikrant" (R11). The new carrier is built by <a href="Cochin%20Shipyard%20Limited">Cochin Shipyard Limited</a>, and will displace . The keel was laid down in February 2009 and she was launched in August 2013. , the ship is being fitted out and is expected to be commissioned by the end of 2018.

The decommissioned ship featured prominently in the film "<a href="ABCD%202">ABCD 2</a>" as a backdrop while it was moored near Darukhana in Mumbai.

James Joyce

James Augustine Aloysius Joyce (2 February 1882 – 13 January 1941) was an Irish novelist, short story writer, poet, teacher, and literary critic. He contributed to the <a href="Modernism">modernist</a> <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> and is regarded as one of the most influential and important authors of the 20th century. Joyce is best known for "<a href="Ulysses%20%28novel%29">Ulysses</a>" (1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>" are paralleled in a variety of literary styles, most famously <a href="Stream%20of%20consciousness%20%28narrative%20mode%29">stream of consciousness</a>. Other well-known works are the short-story collection "<a href="Dubliners">Dubliners</a>" (1914), and the novels "<a href="A%20Portrait%20of%20the%20Artist%20as%20a%20Young%20Man">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</a>" (1916) and "<a href="Finnegans%20Wake">Finnegans Wake</a>" (1939). His other writings include three books of poetry, a play, his published letters and occasional journalism.

Joyce was born in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> into a middle-class family. A brilliant student, he briefly attended the Christian Brothers-run <a href="O%27Connell%20School">O'Connell School</a> before excelling at the Jesuit schools <a href="Clongowes%20Wood%20College">Clongowes</a> and <a href="Belvedere%20College">Belvedere</a>, despite the chaotic family life imposed by his father's alcoholism and unpredictable finances. He went on to attend <a href="University%20College%20Dublin">University College Dublin</a>.

In 1904, in his early twenties, Joyce emigrated to continental Europe with his partner (and later wife) <a href="Nora%20Barnacle">Nora Barnacle</a>. They lived in <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a>, <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, and <a href="Zurich">Zurich</a>. Although most of his adult life was spent abroad, Joyce's fictional universe centres on Dublin and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there. "Ulysses" in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city. Shortly after the publication of "Ulysses", he elucidated this preoccupation somewhat, saying, "For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal."

On 2 February 1882, Joyce was born at 41 Brighton Square, <a href="Rathgar">Rathgar</a>, <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, Ireland. Joyce's father was <a href="John%20Stanislaus%20Joyce">John Stanislaus Joyce</a> and his mother was Mary Jane "May" Murray. He was the eldest of ten surviving siblings; two died of <a href="typhoid">typhoid</a>. James was baptised according to the Rites of the <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20Ireland">Catholic Church</a> in the nearby St Joseph's Church in <a href="Terenure">Terenure</a> on 5 February 1882 by Rev. John O'Mulloy. Joyce's godparents were Philip and Ellen McCann.

John Stanislaus Joyce's family came from <a href="Fermoy">Fermoy</a> in <a href="County%20Cork">County Cork</a>, and had owned a small salt and lime works. Joyce's paternal grandfather, James Augustine Joyce, married Ellen O'Connell, daughter of John O'Connell, a Cork Alderman who owned a drapery business and other properties in Cork City. Ellen's family claimed kinship with <a href="Daniel%20O%27Connell">Daniel O'Connell</a>, "The Liberator". The Joyce family's purported ancestor, <a href="Se%C3%A1n%20M%C3%B3r%20Seoighe">Seán Mór Seoighe</a> (fl. 1680) was a stonemason from <a href="Connemara">Connemara</a>.

In 1887, his father was appointed rate collector by <a href="Dublin%20Corporation">Dublin Corporation</a>; the family subsequently moved to the fashionable adjacent small town of <a href="Bray%2C%20County%20Wicklow">Bray</a>, from Dublin. Around this time Joyce was attacked by a dog, leading to his lifelong <a href="cynophobia">cynophobia</a>. He suffered from <a href="astraphobia">astraphobia</a>; a superstitious aunt had described thunderstorms as a sign of God's wrath.

In 1891 Joyce wrote a poem on the death of <a href="Charles%20Stewart%20Parnell">Charles Stewart Parnell</a>. His father was angry at the treatment of Parnell by the Catholic Church, the <a href="Irish%20Parliamentary%20Party">Irish Home Rule Party</a> and the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">British Liberal Party</a> and the resulting collaborative failure to secure Home Rule for Ireland. The Irish Party had dropped Parnell from leadership. But the Vatican's role in allying with the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">British Conservative Party</a> to prevent Home Rule left a lasting impression on the young Joyce. The elder Joyce had the poem printed and even sent a part to the <a href="Vatican%20Library">Vatican Library</a>. In November, John Joyce was entered in "<a href="Stubbs%27%20Gazette">Stubbs' Gazette</a>" (a publisher of bankruptcies) and suspended from work. In 1893, John Joyce was dismissed with a pension, beginning the family's slide into poverty caused mainly by his drinking and financial mismanagement.

Joyce had begun his education at <a href="Clongowes%20Wood%20College">Clongowes Wood College</a>, a <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuit</a> boarding school near <a href="Clane">Clane</a>, County Kildare, in 1888 but had to leave in 1892 when his father could no longer pay the fees. Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the <a href="Congregation%20of%20Christian%20Brothers">Christian Brothers</a> <a href="O%27Connell%20School">O'Connell School</a> on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered a place in the Jesuits' Dublin school, <a href="Belvedere%20College">Belvedere College</a>, in 1893. This came about because of a chance meeting his father had with a Jesuit priest called <a href="John%20Conmee">John Conmee</a> who knew the family and Joyce was given a reduction in fees to attend Belvedere. In 1895, Joyce, now aged 13, was elected to join the <a href="Sodality%20of%20Our%20Lady">Sodality of Our Lady</a> by his peers at Belvedere. The philosophy of <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> continued to have a strong influence on him for most of his life.

Joyce enrolled at the recently established <a href="University%20College%20Dublin">University College Dublin</a> (UCD) in 1898, studying English, French and Italian. He became active in theatrical and literary circles in the city. In 1900 his laudatory review of <a href="Henrik%20Ibsen">Henrik Ibsen</a>'s "<a href="When%20We%20Dead%20Awaken">When We Dead Awaken</a>" was published in "<a href="The%20Fortnightly%20Review">The Fortnightly Review</a>"; it was his first publication and, after learning basic Norwegian to send a fan letter to Ibsen, he received a letter of thanks from the dramatist. Joyce wrote a number of other articles and at least two plays (since lost) during this period. Many of the friends he made at University College Dublin appeared as characters in Joyce's works. His closest colleagues included leading figures of the generation, most notably, <a href="Tom%20Kettle">Tom Kettle</a>, <a href="Francis%20Sheehy-Skeffington">Francis Sheehy-Skeffington</a> and <a href="Oliver%20St.%20John%20Gogarty">Oliver St. John Gogarty</a>. Joyce was first introduced to the Irish public by <a href="Arthur%20Griffith">Arthur Griffith</a> in his newspaper, "<a href="United%20Irishman">United Irishman</a>", in November 1901. Joyce had written an article on the <a href="Irish%20Literary%20Theatre">Irish Literary Theatre</a> and his college magazine refused to print it. Joyce had it printed and distributed locally. Griffith himself wrote a piece decrying the censorship of the student James Joyce. In 1901, the National Census of Ireland lists James Joyce (19) as an English- and <a href="Irish%20language">Irish-speaking</a> scholar living with his mother and father, six sisters and three brothers at Royal Terrace (now Inverness Road), <a href="Clontarf%2C%20Dublin">Clontarf, Dublin</a>.

After graduating from UCD in 1902, Joyce left for Paris to study medicine, but he soon abandoned this. Richard Ellmann suggests that this may have been because he found the technical lectures in French too difficult. Joyce had already failed to pass chemistry in English in Dublin. But Joyce claimed ill health as the problem and wrote home that he was unwell and complained about the cold weather. He stayed on for a few months, appealing for finance his family could ill afford and reading late in the <a href="Biblioth%C3%A8que%20Sainte-Genevi%C3%A8ve">Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève</a>. When his mother was diagnosed with cancer, his father sent a telegram which read, "NOTHER DYING COME HOME FATHER". Joyce returned to Ireland. Fearing for her son's impiety, his mother tried unsuccessfully to get Joyce to make his confession and to take communion. She finally passed into a coma and died on 13 August, James and his brother <a href="Stanislaus%20Joyce">Stanislaus</a> having refused to kneel with other members of the family praying at her bedside. After her death he continued to drink heavily, and conditions at home grew quite appalling. He scraped together a living reviewing books, teaching, and singing—he was an accomplished <a href="tenor">tenor</a>, and won the bronze medal in the 1904 <a href="Feis%20Ceoil">Feis Ceoil</a>.

On 7 January 1904 Joyce attempted to publish "A Portrait of the Artist", an essay-story dealing with <a href="aesthetics">aesthetics</a>, only to have it rejected by the free-thinking magazine "Dana". He decided, on his twenty-second birthday, to revise the story into a novel he called "Stephen Hero". It was a fictional rendering of Joyce's youth, but he eventually grew frustrated with its direction and abandoned this work. It was never published in this form, but years later, in Trieste, Joyce completely rewrote it as "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man". The unfinished "Stephen Hero" was published after his death.

Also in 1904 he met <a href="Nora%20Barnacle">Nora Barnacle</a>, a young woman from <a href="Galway">Galway city</a> who was working as a chambermaid. On 16 June 1904 they had their first outing together, they walked to the Dublin suburb of <a href="Ringsend">Ringsend</a>, where Nora masturbated him. This event was commemorated by providing the date for the action of "Ulysses" (as "<a href="Bloomsday">Bloomsday</a>").

Joyce remained in Dublin for some time longer, drinking heavily. After one of his drinking binges, he got into a fight over a misunderstanding with a man in <a href="St%20Stephen%27s%20Green">St Stephen's Green</a>; he was picked up and dusted off by a minor acquaintance of his father, Alfred H. Hunter, who took him into his home to tend to his injuries. Hunter was rumoured to be a Jew and to have an unfaithful wife and would serve as one of the models for <a href="Leopold%20Bloom">Leopold Bloom</a>, the protagonist of "Ulysses". He took up with the medical student Oliver St. John Gogarty, who informed the character for <a href="Buck%20Mulligan">Buck Mulligan</a> in "Ulysses". After six nights in the <a href="James%20Joyce%20Tower%20and%20Museum">Martello Tower</a> that Gogarty was renting in Sandycove, he left in the middle of the night following an altercation which involved another student he lived with, the unstable Dermot Chenevix Trench (Haines in "Ulysses"), who fired a pistol at some pans hanging directly over Joyce's bed. Joyce walked the back to Dublin to stay with relatives for the night, and sent a friend to the tower the next day to pack his trunk. Shortly after, the couple left Ireland to live on the continent.

Joyce and Nora went into self-imposed exile, moving first to Zurich in Switzerland, where he ostensibly taught English at the <a href="Berlitz%20Language%20Schools">Berlitz Language School</a> through an agent in England. It later became evident that the agent had been swindled; the director of the school sent Joyce on to <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a>, which was then part of <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> (until the First World War), and is today part of Italy. Once again, he found there was no position for him, but with the help of Almidano Artifoni, director of the Trieste Berlitz School, he finally secured a teaching position in <a href="Pula">Pola</a>, then also part of Austria-Hungary (today part of <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>). He stayed there, teaching English mainly to Austro-Hungarian naval officers stationed at the Pola base, from October 1904 until March 1905, when the Austrians—having discovered an espionage ring in the city—expelled all <a href="Alien%20%28law%29">aliens</a>. With Artifoni's help, he moved back to Trieste and began teaching English there. He remained in Trieste for most of the next ten years.

Later that year Nora gave birth to their first child, George (known as Giorgio). Joyce persuaded his brother, Stanislaus, to join him in Trieste, and secured a teaching position for him at the school. Joyce sought to augment his family's meagre income with his brother's earnings. Stanislaus and Joyce had strained relations while they lived together in Trieste, arguing about Joyce's drinking habits and frivolity with money.

Joyce became frustrated with life in Trieste and moved to Rome in late 1906, taking employment as a clerk in a bank. He disliked Rome and returned to Trieste in early 1907. His daughter <a href="Lucia%20Joyce">Lucia</a> was born later that year.

Joyce returned to Dublin in mid-1909 with George, to visit his father and work on getting "Dubliners" published. He visited Nora's family in <a href="Galway">Galway</a> and liked Nora's mother very much. While preparing to return to Trieste he decided to take one of his sisters, Eva, back with him to help Nora run the home. He spent a month in Trieste before returning to Dublin, this time as a representative of some cinema owners and businessmen from Trieste. With their backing he launched Ireland's first cinema, the <a href="Volta%20Cinematograph">Volta Cinematograph</a>, which was well-received, but fell apart after Joyce left. He returned to Trieste in January 1910 with another sister, Eileen, in tow. Eva became homesick for Dublin and returned there a few years later, but Eileen spent the rest of her life on the continent, eventually marrying the <a href="Czech%20people">Czech</a> bank cashier Frantisek Schaurek.

Joyce returned to Dublin again briefly in mid-1912 during his years-long fight with Dublin publisher George Roberts over the publication of "Dubliners". His trip was once again fruitless, and on his return he wrote the poem "Gas from a Burner", an invective against Roberts. After this trip, he never again came closer to Dublin than London, despite many pleas from his father and invitations from his fellow Irish writer <a href="William%20Butler%20Yeats">William Butler Yeats</a>.

One of his students in Trieste was Ettore Schmitz, better known by the pseudonym <a href="Italo%20Svevo">Italo Svevo</a>. They met in 1907 and became lasting friends and mutual critics. Schmitz was a Catholic of Jewish origin and became a primary model for Leopold Bloom; most of the details about the <a href="Judaism">Jewish faith</a> in "Ulysses" came from Schmitz's responses to queries from Joyce. While living in Trieste, Joyce was first beset with eye problems that ultimately required over a dozen surgical operations.

Joyce concocted a number of money-making schemes during this period, including an attempt to become a cinema <a href="Business%20magnate">magnate</a> in Dublin. He frequently discussed but ultimately abandoned a plan to import Irish tweed to Trieste. Correspondence relating to that venture with the Irish Woollen Mills were for a long time displayed in the windows of their premises in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>. Joyce's skill at borrowing money saved him from indigence. What income he had came partially from his position at the Berlitz school and partially from teaching private students.

In 1915, after most of his students in Trieste were conscripted to fight in the First World War, Joyce moved to <a href="Zurich">Zurich</a>. Two influential private students, Baron Ambrogio Ralli and Count Francesco Sordina, petitioned officials for an exit permit for the Joyces, who in turn agreed not to take any action against the emperor of Austria-Hungary during the war.

During this period Joyce took an active interest in <a href="socialism">socialism</a>. He had attended socialist meetings when he was still in Dublin and 1905, while in Trieste, he described his politics as "those of a socialist artist." Although his practical engagement waned after 1907 due to the "endless internecine warfare" he observed in socialist organizations, many Joyce scholars such as <a href="Richard%20Ellmann">Richard Ellmann</a>, Dominic Manganiello, <a href="Robert%20Scholes">Robert Scholes</a>, and George J. Watson agree that Joyce's interest in socialism and pacifistic anarchism continued for much of his life, and that both the form and content of Joyce's work reflect a sympathy for democratic and socialist ideas. In 1918 he declared himself "against every state" and found much succor in the individualist philosophies of <a href="Benjamin%20Tucker">Benjamin Tucker</a> and <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>'s "<a href="The%20Soul%20of%20Man%20under%20Socialism">The Soul of Man under Socialism</a>".

Joyce set himself to finishing "Ulysses" in Paris, delighted to find that he was gradually gaining fame as an avant-garde writer. A further grant from <a href="Harriet%20Shaw%20Weaver">Harriet Shaw Weaver</a> meant he could devote himself full-time to writing again, as well as consort with other literary figures in the city. During this time, Joyce's eyes began to give him more and more problems and he often wore an <a href="eyepatch">eyepatch</a>. He was treated by Louis Borsch in Paris, undergoing nine operations before Borsch's death in 1929. Throughout the 1930s he travelled frequently to Switzerland for eye surgeries and for treatments for his daughter Lucia, who, according to the Joyces, suffered from <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>. Lucia was analysed by <a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Jung</a> at the time, who after reading "Ulysses" is said to have concluded that her father had schizophrenia. Jung said that she and her father were two people heading to the bottom of a river, except that Joyce was diving and Lucia was sinking.

In Paris, <a href="Maria%20Jolas">Maria</a> and <a href="Eugene%20Jolas">Eugene Jolas</a> nursed Joyce during his long years of writing "Finnegans Wake". Were it not for their support (along with Harriet Shaw Weaver's constant financial support), there is a good possibility that his books might never have been finished or published. In their literary magazine "<a href="Transition%20%28literary%20journal%29">transition</a>", the Jolases published serially various sections of "Finnegans Wake" under the title "Work in Progress". Joyce returned to Zurich in late 1940, fleeing the <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20France%20during%20World%20War%20II">Nazi occupation of France</a>. Joyce used his contacts to help some sixteen Jews escape Nazi persecution.

The issue of Joyce's relationship with religion is somewhat controversial. Early in life, he lapsed from Catholicism, according to first-hand testimonies coming from himself, his brother Stanislaus Joyce, and his wife:

My mind rejects the whole present social order and Christianity—home, the recognised virtues, classes of life and religious doctrines. [...] Six years ago I left the Catholic church, hating it most fervently. I found it impossible for me to remain in it on account of the impulses of my nature. I made secret war upon it when I was a student and declined to accept the positions it offered me. By doing this I made myself a beggar but I retained my pride. Now I make open war upon it by what I write and say and do.

When the arrangements for Joyce's burial were being made, a Catholic priest offered a religious service, which Joyce's wife, Nora, declined, saying, "I couldn't do that to him."

<a href="Leonard%20Strong">Leonard Strong</a>, William T. Noon, Robert Boyle and others have argued that Joyce, later in life, reconciled with the faith he rejected earlier in life and that his parting with the faith was succeeded by a not so obvious reunion, and that "Ulysses" and "Finnegans Wake" are essentially Catholic expressions. Likewise, <a href="Hugh%20Kenner">Hugh Kenner</a> and <a href="T.S.%20Eliot">T.S. Eliot</a> believed they saw between the lines of Joyce's work the outlook of a serious Christian and that beneath the veneer of the work lies a remnant of Catholic belief and attitude. Kevin Sullivan maintains that, rather than reconciling with the faith, Joyce never left it. Critics holding this view insist that Stephen, the protagonist of the semi-autobiographical "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man" as well as "Ulysses", is not Joyce. Somewhat cryptically, in an interview after completing Ulysses, in response to the question "When did you leave the Catholic Church", Joyce answered, "That's for the Church to say." Eamonn Hughes maintains that Joyce takes a <a href="dialectic">dialectic</a> approach, both affirming and denying, saying that Stephen's much noted "<a href="non-serviam">non-serviam</a>" is qualified—"I will not serve "that which I no longer believe"...", and that the "non-serviam" will always be balanced by Stephen's "I am a servant..." and Molly's "yes". He attended Catholic Mass and Orthodox Sacred Liturgy, especially during Holy Week, purportedly for aesthetic reasons. His sisters noted his Holy Week attendance and that he did not seek to dissuade them. One friend witnessed him cry "secret tears" upon hearing Jesus' words on the cross and another accused him of being a "believer at heart" because of his frequent attendance at church.

<a href="Umberto%20Eco">Umberto Eco</a> compares Joyce to the ancient "<a href="episcopi%20vagantes">episcopi vagantes</a>" (wandering bishops) in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. They left a discipline, not a cultural heritage or a way of thinking. Like them, the writer retains the sense of <a href="blasphemy">blasphemy</a> held as a liturgical ritual.

Some critics and biographers have opined along the lines of Andrew Gibson: "The modern James Joyce may have vigorously resisted the oppressive power of Catholic tradition. But there was another Joyce who asserted his allegiance to that tradition, and never left it, or wanted to leave it, behind him." Gibson argues that Joyce "remained a Catholic intellectual if not a believer" since his thinking remained influenced by his cultural background, even though he lived apart from that culture. His relationship with religion was complex and not easily understood, even perhaps by himself. He acknowledged the debt he owed to his early Jesuit training. Joyce told the sculptor <a href="August%20Suter%20%28sculptor%29">August Suter</a>, that from his Jesuit education, he had 'learnt to arrange things in such a way that they become easy to survey and to judge.'

On 11 January 1941, Joyce underwent surgery in Zurich for a <a href="perforated%20ulcer">perforated duodenal ulcer</a>. He fell into a coma the following day. He awoke at 2 a.m. on 13 January 1941, and asked a nurse to call his wife and son, before losing consciousness again. They were en route when he died 15 minutes later. Joyce was less than a month short of his 59th birthday.

His body was buried in the <a href="Fluntern%20Cemetery">Fluntern Cemetery</a>, Zurich. The Swiss tenor <a href="Max%20Meili">Max Meili</a> sang "Addio terra, addio cielo" from <a href="Monteverdi">Monteverdi</a>'s "<a href="L%27Orfeo">L'Orfeo</a>" at the burial service. Although two senior Irish diplomats were in Switzerland at the time, neither attended Joyce's funeral, and the Irish government later declined Nora's offer to permit the repatriation of Joyce's remains. When <a href="Joseph%20Walshe">Joseph Walshe</a> secretary at the Department of External Affairs in Dublin was informed of Joyce's death by Frank Cremins, <a href="charg%C3%A9%20d%27affaires">chargé d'affaires</a> at Berne, Walshe responded "Please wire details of Joyce's death. If possible find out did he die a Catholic? Express sympathy with Mrs Joyce and explain inability to attend funeral". Buried originally in an ordinary grave, Joyce was moved in 1966 to a more prominent "honour grave," with a seated portrait statue by American artist <a href="Milton%20Hebald">Milton Hebald</a> nearby. Nora, whom he had married in 1931, survived him by 10 years. She is buried by his side, as is their son Giorgio, who died in 1976.

"Dubliners" is a collection of fifteen short stories by Joyce, first published in 1914. They form a naturalistic depiction of Irish middle class life in and around Dublin in the early years of the 20th century.

The stories were written when Irish nationalism was at its peak and a search for a national identity and purpose was raging; at a crossroads of history and culture, Ireland was jolted by converging ideas and influences. The stories centre on Joyce's idea of an epiphany: a moment when a character experiences a life-changing self-understanding or illumination. Many of the characters in "Dubliners" later appear in minor roles in Joyce's novel "Ulysses". The initial stories in the collection are narrated by child protagonists. Subsequent stories deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people. This aligns with Joyce's tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence and maturity.

"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man" is a nearly complete rewrite of the abandoned novel "<a href="Stephen%20Hero">Stephen Hero</a>". Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript in a fit of rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A "<a href="K%C3%BCnstlerroman">Künstlerroman</a>", "Portrait" is a heavily autobiographical <a href="bildungsroman">coming-of-age novel</a> depicting the childhood and adolescence of the protagonist <a href="Stephen%20Dedalus">Stephen Dedalus</a> and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as <a href="Stream%20of%20consciousness%20%28narrative%20mode%29">stream of consciousness</a>, <a href="interior%20monologue">interior monologue</a>, and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.

Despite early interest in the theatre, Joyce published only one play, "<a href="Exiles%20%28play%29">Exiles</a>", begun shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and published in 1918. A study of a husband and wife relationship, the play looks back to "The Dead" (the final story in "Dubliners") and forward to "Ulysses", which Joyce began around the time of the play's composition.

Joyce published a number of books of poetry. His first mature published work was the satirical broadside "The Holy Office" (1904), in which he proclaimed himself to be the superior of many prominent members of the <a href="Celtic%20Revival">Celtic Revival</a>. His first full-length poetry collection "<a href="Chamber%20Music%20%28poetry%20collection%29">Chamber Music</a>" (1907; referring, Joyce joked, to the sound of urine hitting the side of a chamber pot) consisted of 36 short lyrics. This publication led to his inclusion in the "<a href="Imagism">Imagist Anthology</a>", edited by <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a>, who was a champion of Joyce's work. Other poetry Joyce published in his lifetime include "Gas From A Burner" (1912), "Pomes Penyeach" (1927), and "Ecce Puer" (written in 1932 to mark the birth of his grandson and the recent death of his father). It was published by the <a href="Black%20Sun%20Press">Black Sun Press</a> in "Collected Poems" (1936).

As he was completing work on "Dubliners" in 1906, Joyce considered adding another story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called <a href="Leopold%20Bloom">Leopold Bloom</a> under the title "Ulysses". Although he did not pursue the idea further at the time, he eventually commenced work on a novel using both the title and basic premise in 1914. The writing was completed in October 1921. Three more months were devoted to working on the proofs of the book before Joyce halted work shortly before his self-imposed deadline, his 40th birthday (2 February 1922).

Thanks to Ezra Pound, serial publication of the novel in the magazine "<a href="The%20Little%20Review">The Little Review</a>" began in March 1918. This magazine was edited by <a href="Margaret%20C.%20Anderson">Margaret C. Anderson</a> and <a href="Jane%20Heap">Jane Heap</a>, with the intermittent financial backing of <a href="John%20Quinn%20%28collector%29">John Quinn</a>, a successful New York commercial lawyer with an interest in contemporary experimental art and literature.

This provoked the first accusations of obscenity with which the book would be identified for so long. Its amorphous structure with frank, intimate musings (‘stream of consciousness’) were seen to offend both church and state. The publication encountered problems with <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">New York Postal Authorities</a>; serialisation ground to a halt in December 1920; the editors were convicted of publishing <a href="obscenity">obscenity</a> in February 1921. Although the conviction was based on the "Nausicaä" episode of "Ulysses", "The Little Review" had fuelled the fires of controversy with <a href="dada">dada</a> poet <a href="Elsa%20von%20Freytag-Loringhoven">Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven</a>'s defence of "Ulysses" in an essay "The Modest Woman." Joyce's novel was not published in the United States until 1934.

Partly because of this controversy, Joyce found it difficult to get a publisher to accept the book, but it was published in 1922 by <a href="Sylvia%20Beach">Sylvia Beach</a> from her well-known <a href="Rive%20Gauche">Rive Gauche</a> bookshop, "<a href="Shakespeare%20and%20Company%20%28bookshop%29">Shakespeare and Company</a>". An English edition published the same year by Joyce's patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver, ran into further difficulties with the United States authorities, and 500 copies that were shipped to the States were seized and possibly destroyed. The following year, <a href="John%20Rodker">John Rodker</a> produced a print run of 500 more intended to replace the missing copies, but these were burned by English customs at <a href="Folkestone">Folkestone</a>. A further consequence of the novel's ambiguous legal status as a banned book was that a number of "bootleg" versions appeared, most notably a number of pirate versions from the publisher <a href="Samuel%20Roth">Samuel Roth</a>. In 1928, a court injunction against Roth was obtained and he ceased publication.

With the appearance of both "Ulysses" and <a href="T.S.%20Eliot">T.S. Eliot</a>'s poem, "<a href="The%20Waste%20Land">The Waste Land</a>", 1922 was a key year in the history of English-language literary modernism. In "Ulysses", Joyce employs stream of consciousness, parody, jokes, and virtually every other literary technique to present his characters. The action of the novel, which takes place in a single day, 16 June 1904, sets the characters and incidents of the <a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a> of <a href="Homer">Homer</a> in modern Dublin and represents <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> (Ulysses), <a href="Penelope">Penelope</a> and <a href="Telemachus">Telemachus</a> in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife <a href="Molly%20Bloom">Molly Bloom</a> and Stephen Dedalus, parodically contrasted with their lofty models. The book explores various areas of Dublin life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Nevertheless, the book is also an affectionately detailed study of the city, and Joyce claimed that if Dublin were to be destroyed in some catastrophe it could be rebuilt, brick by brick, using his work as a model. In order to achieve this level of accuracy, Joyce used the 1904 edition of <a href="Thom%27s%20Directory">Thom's Directory</a>—a work that listed the owners and/or tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city. He also bombarded friends still living there with requests for information and clarification.

The book consists of 18 chapters, each covering roughly one hour of the day, beginning around about 8 a.m. and ending sometime after 2 a.m. the following morning. Each of the 18 chapters of the novel employs its own literary style. Each chapter also refers to a specific episode in Homer's Odyssey and has a specific colour, art or science and bodily organ associated with it. This combination of kaleidoscopic writing with an extreme formal, schematic structure represents one of the book's major contributions to the development of 20th century modernist literature. The use of <a href="classical%20mythology">classical mythology</a> as a framework for his book and the near-obsessive focus on external detail in a book in which much of the significant action is happening inside the minds of the characters are others. Nevertheless, Joyce complained that, "I may have oversystematised "Ulysses"," and played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles that had been taken from Homer. Joyce was reluctant to publish the chapter titles because he wanted his work to stand separately from the Greek form. It was only when <a href="Stuart%20Gilbert">Stuart Gilbert</a> published his critical work on "Ulysses" in 1930 that the schema was supplied by Joyce to Gilbert. But as Terrence Killeen points out this schema was developed after the novel had been written and was not something that Joyce consulted as he wrote the novel.

Having completed work on "Ulysses", Joyce was so exhausted that he did not write a line of prose for a year. On 10 March 1923 he informed his patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver: "Yesterday I wrote two pages—the first I have since the final "Yes" of "Ulysses". Having found a pen, with some difficulty I copied them out in a large handwriting on a double sheet of <a href="wikt%3Afoolscap">foolscap</a> so that I could read them. "Il lupo perde il pelo ma non il vizio", the Italians say. 'The wolf may lose his skin but not his vice' or 'the leopard cannot change his spots.'" Thus was born a text that became known, first, as "Work in Progress" and later "Finnegans Wake".

By 1926 Joyce had completed the first two parts of the book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine "transition". For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors, including the death of his father in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter <a href="Lucia%20Joyce">Lucia</a>, and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including <a href="Samuel%20Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a>. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend <a href="James%20Stephens%20%28author%29">James Stephens</a> to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego, an example of Joyce's superstitions.

Reaction to the work was mixed, including negative comment from early supporters of Joyce's work, such as Pound and the author's brother, Stanislaus Joyce. To counteract this hostile reception, a book of essays by supporters of the new work, including Beckett, <a href="William%20Carlos%20Williams">William Carlos Williams</a> and others was organised and published in 1929 under the title "<a href="Our%20Exagmination%20Round%20His%20Factification%20for%20Incamination%20of%20Work%20in%20Progress">Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress</a>". At his 57th birthday party at the Jolases' home, Joyce revealed the final title of the work and "Finnegans Wake" was published in book form on 4 May 1939. Later, further negative comments surfaced from doctor and author <a href="Hervey%20M.%20Cleckley">Hervey Cleckley</a>, who questioned the significance others had placed on the work. In his book, "<a href="The%20Mask%20of%20Sanity">The Mask of Sanity</a>", Cleckley refers to "<a href="Finnegans%20Wake">Finnegans Wake</a>" as "a 628-page collection of erudite gibberish indistinguishable to most people from the familiar word salad produced by hebephrenic patients on the back wards of any state hospital."

Joyce's method of stream of consciousness, literary allusions and free dream associations was pushed to the limit in "Finnegans Wake", which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction and is written in a peculiar and obscure English, based mainly on complex multi-level puns. This approach is similar to, but far more extensive than that used by <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a> in "<a href="Jabberwocky">Jabberwocky</a>". This has led many readers and critics to apply Joyce's oft-quoted description in the "Wake" of "Ulysses" as his "usylessly unreadable Blue Book of Eccles" to the "Wake" itself. However, readers have been able to reach a consensus about the central cast of characters and general plot.

Much of the wordplay in the book stems from the use of multilingual puns which draw on a wide range of languages. The role played by Beckett and other assistants included collating words from these languages on cards for Joyce to use and, as Joyce's eyesight worsened, of writing the text from the author's dictation.

The view of history propounded in this text is very strongly influenced by <a href="Giambattista%20Vico">Giambattista Vico</a>, and the metaphysics of <a href="Giordano%20Bruno">Giordano Bruno</a> of <a href="Nola">Nola</a> are important to the interplay of the "characters." Vico propounded a cyclical view of history, in which civilisation rose from chaos, passed through theocratic, aristocratic, and democratic phases, and then lapsed back into chaos. The most obvious example of the influence of Vico's cyclical theory of history is to be found in the opening and closing words of the book. "Finnegans Wake" opens with the words "riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs." ("vicus" is a pun on Vico) and ends "A way a lone a last a loved a long the." In other words, the book ends with the beginning of a sentence and begins with the end of the same sentence, turning the book into one great cycle. Indeed, Joyce said that the ideal reader of the "Wake" would suffer from "ideal insomnia" and, on completing the book, would turn to page one and start again, and so on in an endless cycle of reading.

Joyce's work has been an important influence on writers and scholars such as <a href="Samuel%20Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a>, <a href="Se%C3%A1n%20%C3%93%20R%C3%ADord%C3%A1in">Seán Ó Ríordáin</a>, <a href="Jorge%20Luis%20Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a>, <a href="Flann%20O%27Brien">Flann O'Brien</a>, <a href="Salman%20Rushdie">Salman Rushdie</a>, <a href="Robert%20Anton%20Wilson">Robert Anton Wilson</a>, <a href="John%20Updike">John Updike</a>, <a href="David%20Lodge%20%28author%29">David Lodge</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Campbell">Joseph Campbell</a>. "Ulysses" has been called "a demonstration and summation of the entire [Modernist] movement". The Bulgarian-French literary theorist <a href="Julia%20Krist%C3%A9va">Julia Kristéva</a> characterised Joyce's novel writing as "polyphonic" and a hallmark of postmodernity alongside the poets <a href="St%C3%A9phane%20Mallarm%C3%A9">Mallarmé</a> and <a href="Rimbaud">Rimbaud</a>.
Some scholars, notably <a href="Vladimir%20Nabokov">Vladimir Nabokov</a>, have reservations, often championing some of his fiction while condemning other works. In Nabokov's opinion, "Ulysses" was brilliant, while "Finnegans Wake" was horrible.

Joyce's influence is also evident in fields other than literature. The sentence "Three quarks for Muster Mark!" in Joyce's "Finnegans Wake" is the source of the word "<a href="quark">quark</a>", the name of one of the <a href="elementary%20particle">elementary particle</a>s proposed by the physicist <a href="Murray%20Gell-Mann">Murray Gell-Mann</a> in 1963.

The work and life of Joyce is celebrated annually on 16 June, known as <a href="Bloomsday">Bloomsday</a>, in Dublin and in an increasing number of cities worldwide, and critical studies in scholarly publications, such as the "<a href="James%20Joyce%20Quarterly">James Joyce Quarterly</a>", continue. Both popular and academic uses of Joyce's work were hampered by restrictions imposed by <a href="Stephen%20J.%20Joyce">Stephen J. Joyce</a>, Joyce's grandson and executor of his literary estate. On 1 January 2012, those restrictions were lessened by the expiry of copyright protection of much of the published work of James Joyce.

In April 2013 the <a href="Central%20Bank%20of%20Ireland">Central Bank of Ireland</a> issued a silver €10 commemorative coin in honour of Joyce that misquoted a famous line from "<a href="Ulysses%20%28novel%29">Ulysses</a>".

Polk is known for chiefly extending the territory of the United States during the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>; during his presidency, the United States expanded significantly with the <a href="annexation%20of%20Texas">annexation</a> of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a>, the <a href="Oregon%20Territory">Oregon Territory</a>, and the <a href="Mexican%20Cession">Mexican Cession</a> following the American victory in the Mexican–American War.

After building a successful law practice in Tennessee, Polk was elected to the state legislature (1823) and then to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> in 1825, becoming a strong supporter of Jackson. After serving as chairman of the <a href="Ways%20and%20Means%20Committee">Ways and Means Committee</a>, he became Speaker in 1835, the only president to have been Speaker. Polk left Congress to run for governor; he won in 1839, but lost in 1841 and 1843. He was a <a href="dark%20horse">dark horse</a> candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201844">1844</a>; he entered his party's convention as a potential nominee for vice president, but emerged as a compromise to head the ticket when no presidential candidate could secure the necessary two-thirds majority. In the general election, Polk defeated <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> of the rival <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a>.

Polk is considered by many the most effective president of the pre–<a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> era, having met during his four-year term every major domestic and foreign policy goal he had set. After a negotiation fraught with risk of war, he reached a settlement with the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a> over the <a href="Oregon%20boundary%20dispute">disputed</a> <a href="Oregon%20Country">Oregon Country</a>, the territory for the most part being divided along the <a href="49th%20parallel%20north">49th parallel</a>. Polk achieved a sweeping victory in the Mexican–American War, which resulted in the cession by Mexico of nearly all the <a href="Southwestern%20United%20States">American Southwest</a>. He secured a substantial reduction of <a href="tariffs%20in%20United%20States%20history">tariff</a> rates with the <a href="Walker%20tariff">Walker tariff</a> of 1846. The same year, he achieved his other major goal, re-establishment of the <a href="Independent%20Treasury">Independent Treasury</a> system. True to his campaign pledge to serve only one term, Polk left office in 1849 and returned to Tennessee; he died in Nashville, most likely of <a href="cholera">cholera</a>, three months after leaving the White House.

Scholars have <a href="Historical%20rankings%20of%20United%20States%20Presidents">ranked</a> Polk favorably for his ability to promote and achieve the major items on his presidential agenda, but he has been criticized for leading the country into war against Mexico and for exacerbating sectional divides. A slaveholder for most of his adult life, he owned a plantation in Mississippi and bought slaves while President. A major legacy of Polk's presidency is territorial expansion, as the United States reached the Pacific coast and became poised to be a world power.

James Knox Polk was born on November 2, 1795 in a log cabin in <a href="Pineville%2C%20North%20Carolina">Pineville, North Carolina</a>. He was the first of 10 children born into a family of farmers. His mother Jane named him after her father, James Knox. His father <a href="Samuel%20Polk">Samuel Polk</a> was a farmer, slaveholder, and surveyor of <a href="Scotch-Irish%20Americans">Scots-Irish</a> descent. The Polks had immigrated to America in the late 1600s, settling initially on the <a href="Eastern%20Shore%20of%20Maryland">Eastern Shore of Maryland</a> but later moving to south-central Pennsylvania and then to the Carolina hill country.

The Knox and Polk families were <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a>. While Polk's mother remained a devout Presbyterian, his father, whose own father <a href="Ezekiel%20Polk">Ezekiel Polk</a> was a <a href="deism">deist</a>, rejected dogmatic Presbyterianism. He refused to declare his belief in Christianity at his son's baptism, and the minister refused to baptize young James. Nevertheless, James' mother "stamped her rigid orthodoxy on James, instilling lifelong Calvinistic traits of self-discipline, hard work, piety, individualism, and a belief in the imperfection of human nature," according to James A. Rawley's "<a href="American%20National%20Biography">American National Biography</a>" article.

In 1803, Ezekiel Polk led four of his adult children and their families to the <a href="Duck%20River%20%28Tennessee%29">Duck River</a> area in what is now <a href="Maury%20County%2C%20Tennessee">Maury County, Tennessee</a>; Samuel Polk and his family followed in 1806. The Polk clan dominated politics in Maury County and in the new town of <a href="Columbia%2C%20Tennessee">Columbia</a>. Samuel became a county judge, and the guests at his home included <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>, who had already served as a judge and in Congress. James learned from the political talk around the dinner table; both Samuel and Ezekiel were strong supporters of President <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> and opponents of the <a href="Federalist%20Party">Federalist Party</a>.

Polk suffered from frail health as a child, a particular disadvantage in a frontier society. His father took him to see prominent Philadelphia physician Dr. <a href="Philip%20Syng%20Physick">Philip Syng Physick</a> for urinary stones. The journey was broken off by James's severe pain, and Dr. <a href="Ephraim%20McDowell">Ephraim McDowell</a> of <a href="Danville%2C%20Kentucky">Danville, Kentucky</a>, operated to remove them. No anesthetic was available except brandy. The operation was successful, but it might have left James impotent or sterile, as he had no children. He recovered quickly, and became more robust. His father offered to bring him into one of his businesses, but he wanted an education and enrolled at a Presbyterian academy in 1813. He became a member of the <a href="Zion%20Presbyterian%20Church%20%28Tennessee%29">Zion Church</a> near his home in 1813, and enrolled in the Zion Church Academy. He then entered Bradley Academy in <a href="Murfreesboro%2C%20Tennessee">Murfreesboro, Tennessee</a>, where he proved a promising student.

In January 1816, Polk was admitted into the <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> as a second-semester sophomore. The Polk family had connections with the university, then a small school of about 80 students; Samuel was its land agent in Tennessee and his cousin <a href="William%20Polk%20%28colonel%29">William Polk</a> was a trustee. Polk's roommate was <a href="William%20Dunn%20Moseley">William Dunn Moseley</a>, who became the first Governor of Florida. Polk joined the <a href="Dialectic%20and%20Philanthropic%20Societies">Dialectic Society</a> where he took part in debates, became its president, and learned the art of oratory. In one address, he warned that some American leaders were flirting with monarchical ideals, singling out <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>, a foe of Jefferson. Polk graduated with honors in May 1818.

After graduation, Polk returned to <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a> to study law under renowned trial attorney <a href="Felix%20Grundy">Felix Grundy</a>, who became his first mentor. On September 20, 1819, he was elected clerk of the <a href="Tennessee%20State%20Senate">Tennessee State Senate</a>, which then sat in Murfreesboro and to which Grundy had been elected. He was re-elected clerk in 1821 without opposition, and continued to serve until 1822. In June 1820, he was admitted to the Tennessee bar, and his first case was to defend his father against a public fighting charge; he secured his release for a one-dollar fine. He opened an office in Maury County and was successful as a lawyer, due largely to the many cases arising from the <a href="Panic%20of%201819">Panic of 1819</a>, a severe depression. His law practice subsidized his political career.

By the time the legislature adjourned its session in September 1822, Polk was determined to be a candidate for the <a href="Tennessee%20House%20of%20Representatives">Tennessee House of Representatives</a>. The election was in August 1823, almost a year away, allowing him ample time for campaigning. Already involved locally as a member of the <a href="Freemasonry">Masons</a>, he was commissioned in the Tennessee militia as a captain in the cavalry regiment of the 5th Brigade. He was later appointed a colonel on the staff of Governor <a href="William%20Carroll%20%28Tennessee%20politician%29">William Carroll</a>, and was afterwards often referred to as "Colonel". Although many of the voters were members of the Polk clan, the young politician campaigned energetically. People liked Polk's oratory, which earned him the nickname "Napoleon of the Stump." At the polls, where Polk provided alcoholic refreshments for his voters, he defeated incumbent William Yancey.

Beginning in early 1822, Polk courted <a href="Sarah%20Childress">Sarah Childress</a>—they were engaged the following year and married on January 1, 1824 in Murfreesboro. Educated far better than most women of her time, especially in frontier Tennessee, Sarah Polk was from one of the state's most prominent families. During James's political career Sarah assisted her husband with his speeches, gave him advice on policy matters, and played an active role in his campaigns. Rawley noted that Sarah Polk's grace, intelligence and charming conversation helped compensate for her husband's often austere manner.

Polk's first mentor was Grundy, but in the legislature, Polk came increasingly to oppose him on such matters as land reform, and came to support the policies of Andrew Jackson, by then a military hero for his victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20New%20Orleans">Battle of New Orleans</a> (1815). Jackson was a family friend to both the Polks and the Childresses—there is evidence Sarah Polk and her siblings called him "Uncle Andrew"—and James Polk quickly came to support his presidential ambitions for 1824. When the <a href="Tennessee%20Legislature">Tennessee Legislature</a> deadlocked on who to elect as U.S. senator in 1823 (until 1913, legislators, not the people, elected senators), Jackson's name was placed in nomination. Polk broke from his usual allies, casting his vote as a member of the state House of Representatives for the general in Jackson's victory. This boosted Jackson's presidential chances by giving him recent political experience to match his military accomplishments. This began an alliance that would continue until Jackson's death early in Polk's presidency. Polk, through much of his political career, was known as "Young Hickory", based on the nickname for Jackson, "Old Hickory". Polk's political career was as dependent on Jackson as his nickname implied.

In the <a href="1824%20U.S.%20presidential%20election">1824 U.S. presidential election</a>, Jackson got the most electoral votes (he also led in the popular vote) but as he did not receive a majority in the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral College</a>, the election was thrown into the <a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>, which chose Secretary of State <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a>, who had received the second-most of each. Polk, like other Jackson supporters, believed that Speaker of the House <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> had traded his support as fourth-place finisher (the House may only choose from among the top three) to Adams in a <a href="Corrupt%20bargain%23Election%20of%201824">Corrupt Bargain</a> in exchange for being the new Secretary of State. Polk had in August 1824 declared his candidacy for the following year's election to the House of Representatives from <a href="Tennessee%27s%206th%20congressional%20district">Tennessee's 6th congressional district</a>. The district stretched from Maury County south to the Alabama line, and extensive electioneering was expected of the five candidates. Polk campaigned so vigorously that Sarah began to worry about his health. During the campaign, Polk's opponents said that at the age of 29 Polk was too young for the responsibility of a seat in the House, but he won the election with 3,669 votes out of 10,440 and took his seat in Congress later that year.

When Polk arrived in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> for Congress' regular session in December 1825, he roomed in Benjamin Burch's boarding house with other Tennessee representatives, including <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a>. Polk made his first major speech on March 13, 1826, in which he said that the Electoral College should be abolished and that the president should be elected by popular vote. Remaining bitter at the alleged Corrupt Bargain between Adams and Clay, Polk became a vocal critic of the <a href="presidency%20of%20John%20Quincy%20Adams">administration</a>, frequently voting against its policies. Sarah Polk remained at home in Columbia during her husband's first year in Congress, but accompanied him to Washington beginning in December 1826; she assisted him with his correspondence, and came to hear James's speeches.

Polk won re-election in 1827 and continued to oppose the Adams administration. He remained in close touch with Jackson, and when Jackson ran for president in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201828">1828</a>, Polk was a corresponding advisor on his campaign. Following Jackson's victory over Adams, Polk became one of the new President's most prominent and loyal supporters in the House. Working on Jackson's behalf, Polk successfully opposed federally-funded "<a href="internal%20improvements">internal improvements</a>" such as a proposed Buffalo-to-New Orleans road, and he was pleased by Jackson's <a href="Maysville%20Road%20veto">Maysville Road veto</a> in May 1830, when Jackson blocked a bill to finance a road extension entirely within one state, Kentucky, deeming it unconstitutional. Jackson opponents alleged that the veto message, which strongly complained about Congress' penchant for passing <a href="pork%20barrel">pork barrel</a> projects, was written by Polk, but he denied this, stating that the message was entirely the President's.

Polk served as Jackson's most prominent House ally in the "<a href="Bank%20War">Bank War</a>" that developed over Jackson's opposition to the re-authorization of the <a href="Second%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">Second Bank of the United States</a>. The Second Bank, headed by <a href="Nicholas%20Biddle%20%28banker%29">Nicholas Biddle</a> of Philadelphia, not only held federal dollars, but controlled much of the credit in the United States, as it could present currency issued by local banks for redemption in gold or silver. Some Westerners, including Jackson, opposed the Second Bank, deeming it a monopoly acting in the interest of Easterners. Polk, as a member of the <a href="House%20Ways%20and%20Means%20Committee">House Ways and Means Committee</a>, conducted investigations of the Second Bank, and though the committee voted for a bill to renew the bank's charter (scheduled to expire in 1836), Polk issued a strong minority report condemning the bank. The bill passed Congress in 1832, but Jackson vetoed it and Congress failed to override the veto. Jackson's action was highly controversial in Washington, but had considerable public support, and he <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201832">won easy re-election in 1832</a>.

Like many Southerners, Polk favored low tariffs on imported goods, and initially sympathized with <a href="John%20C.%20Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a>'s opposition to the <a href="Tariff%20of%20Abominations">Tariff of Abominations</a> during the <a href="Nullification%20Crisis">Nullification Crisis</a> of 1832–1833, but came over to Jackson's side as Calhoun moved towards advocating secession. Thereafter, Polk remained loyal to Jackson as the President sought to assert federal authority. Polk condemned secession and supported the <a href="Force%20Bill">Force Bill</a> against South Carolina, which had claimed the authority to nullify federal tariffs. The matter was settled by Congress passing a <a href="Tariff%20of%201833">compromise tariff</a>.

In December 1833, after being elected to a fifth consecutive term, Polk, with Jackson's backing, became the chairman of Ways and Means, a powerful position in the House. In that position, Polk supported Jackson's withdrawal of federal funds from the Second Bank. Polk's committee issued a report questioning the Second Bank's finances, and another supporting Jackson's actions against it. In April 1834, the Ways and Means Committee reported a bill to regulate state deposit banks, which, when passed, enabled Jackson to deposit funds in <a href="pet%20banks">pet banks</a>, and Polk got legislation passed to allow the sale of the government's stock in the Second Bank.

In June 1834, <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> <a href="Andrew%20Stevenson">Andrew Stevenson</a> resigned from Congress to become <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Minister to the United Kingdom</a>. With Jackson's support, Polk ran for Speaker against fellow Tennessean <a href="John%20Bell%20%28Tennessee%20politician%29">John Bell</a>, Calhoun disciple <a href="Richard%20Henry%20Wilde">Richard Henry Wilde</a>, and <a href="Joel%20Barlow%20Sutherland">Joel Barlow Sutherland</a> of Pennsylvania. After ten ballots, Bell, who had the support of many opponents of the administration, defeated Polk. Jackson called in political debts to try to get Polk elected Speaker at the start of the next Congress in December 1835, assuring Polk in a letter he meant him to burn that New England would support him for Speaker. They were successful; Polk defeated Bell to take the Speakership.

According to Thomas M. Leonard in his book on Polk, "by 1836, while serving as Speaker of the House of Representatives, Polk approached the zenith of his congressional career. He was at the center of <a href="Jacksonian%20Democracy">Jacksonian Democracy</a> on the House floor, and, with the help of his wife, he ingratiated himself into Washington's social circles." The prestige of the Speakership caused them to abandon life in a Washington boarding house for their own residence on Pennsylvania Avenue. In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201836">1836 presidential election</a>, Vice President <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a>, Jackson's chosen successor, defeated multiple <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig</a> candidates, including Tennessee Senator <a href="Hugh%20Lawson%20White">Hugh Lawson White</a>. Greater Whig strength in Tennessee helped White carry his state, though Polk's home district went for Van Buren. Ninety percent of Tennessee voters had supported Jackson in 1832, but many in the state disliked the destruction of the Second Bank, or were unwilling to support Van Buren.

As Speaker, Polk worked for the policies of Jackson and later Van Buren. Polk appointed committees with Democratic chairs and majorities, including the New York radical <a href="Churchill%20C.%20Cambreleng">C. C. Cambreleng</a> as the new Ways and Means chair, although he tried to maintain the Speaker's traditional nonpartisan appearance. The two major issues during Polk's speakership were slavery and, after the <a href="Panic%20of%201837">Panic of 1837</a>, the economy. Polk firmly enforced the "<a href="gag%20rule">gag rule</a>", by which the House of Representatives would not accept or debate citizen petitions regarding slavery. This ignited fierce protests from John Quincy Adams, who was by then a congressman from Massachusetts and an abolitionist. Instead of finding a way to silence Adams, Polk frequently engaged in useless shouting matches, leading Jackson to conclude that the Speaker should have shown better leadership. Van Buren and Polk faced pressure to rescind the <a href="Specie%20Circular">Specie Circular</a>, Jackson's 1836 order that payment for government lands be in gold and silver. Some believed this had led to the crash by causing a lack of confidence in paper currency issued by banks. Despite such arguments, with support from Polk and his cabinet, Van Buren chose to back the Specie Circular. Polk and Van Buren attempted to establish an Independent Treasury system that would allow the government to oversee its own deposits (rather than using pet banks), but the bill was defeated in the House. It eventually passed in 1840.

Using his thorough grasp of the House's rules, Polk attempted to bring greater order to its proceedings. Unlike many of his peers, he never challenged anyone to a duel no matter how much they insulted his honor. The economic downturn cost the Democrats seats, so that when he faced re-election as Speaker in December 1837, he won by only 13 votes, and he foresaw defeat in 1839. Polk by then had presidential ambitions, but was well aware that no Speaker had ever become president (Polk is still the only one to have held both offices). After seven terms in the House, two as Speaker, he announced that he would not seek re-election, choosing instead to run for Governor of Tennessee in the 1839 election.

In 1835, the Democrats had lost the governorship of Tennessee for the first time in their history, and Polk decided to return home to help the party. Polk returned to a Tennessee afire for White and Whiggism; the state had changed greatly in its political loyalties since the days of Jacksonian domination. Polk undertook his first statewide campaign, against the Whig incumbent, <a href="Newton%20Cannon">Newton Cannon</a>, who sought a third two-year term as governor. The fact that Polk was the one called upon to "redeem" Tennessee from the Whigs tacitly acknowledged him as head of the state Democratic Party.

Polk campaigned on national issues, whereas Cannon stressed matters local to Tennessee. After being bested by Polk in the early debates, the governor retreated to Nashville, by then the state capital, alleging important official business. Polk made speeches across the state, seeking to become known more widely than in his native <a href="Middle%20Tennessee">Middle Tennessee</a>. When Cannon came back on the campaign trail in the final days, Polk pursued him, hastening the length of the state to be able to debate the governor again. On Election Day, August 1, 1839, Polk defeated Cannon, 54,102 to 51,396, as the Democrats recaptured the state legislature and won back three congressional seats in Tennessee.

Tennessee's governor had limited power—there was no gubernatorial veto, and the small size of the state government limited any political patronage. But Polk saw the office as a springboard for his national ambitions, seeking to be nominated as Van Buren's vice presidential running mate at the <a href="1840%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1840 Democratic National Convention</a> in Baltimore in May. Polk hoped to be the replacement if Vice President <a href="Richard%20Mentor%20Johnson">Richard Mentor Johnson</a> was dumped from the ticket; Johnson was disliked by many Southern whites for fathering two daughters by a biracial mistress, and attempting to introduce them into white society. Johnson was from Kentucky, so Polk's Tennessee residence would keep the New Yorker Van Buren's ticket balanced. The convention chose to endorse no one for vice president, stating that a choice would be made once the popular vote was cast. Three weeks after the convention, recognizing that Johnson was too popular in the party to be ousted, Polk withdrew his name. The Whig presidential candidate, General <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a>, conducted <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201840">a rollicking campaign</a> with the motto "<a href="Tippecanoe%20and%20Tyler%20Too">Tippecanoe and Tyler Too</a>", easily winning both the national vote and that in Tennessee. Polk campaigned in vain for Van Buren and was embarrassed by the outcome; Jackson, who had returned to his home, <a href="The%20Hermitage%20%28Nashville%2C%20Tennessee%29">the Hermitage</a>, near Nashville, was horrified at the prospect of a Whig administration. Harrison's death after a month in office in 1841 left the presidency to Vice President <a href="John%20Tyler">John Tyler</a>, who soon broke with the Whigs.

Polk's three major programs during his governorship; regulating state banks, implementing state internal improvements, and improving education all failed to win the approval of the legislature. His only major success as governor was his politicking to secure the replacement of Tennessee's two Whig U.S. senators with Democrats. Polk's tenure was hindered by the continuing nationwide economic crisis that had followed the Panic of 1837 and which had caused Van Buren to lose the <a href="U.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%201840">1840 election</a>.

Encouraged by the success of Harrison's campaign, the Whigs ran a freshman legislator from frontier <a href="Wilson%20County%2C%20Tennessee">Wilson County</a>, <a href="James%20C.%20Jones">James C. Jones</a> against Polk in 1841. "Lean Jimmy" had proven one of their most effective gadflies against Polk, and his lighthearted tone at campaign debates was very effective against the serious Polk. The two debated the length of Tennessee, and Jones's support of distribution to the states of surplus federal revenues, and of a national bank, struck a chord with Tennessee voters. On election day in August 1841, Polk was defeated by 3,000 votes, the first time he had been beaten at the polls. Polk returned to Columbia and the practice of law, and prepared for a rematch against Jones in 1843, but though the new governor took less of a joking tone, it made little difference to the outcome, as Polk was beaten again, this time by 3,833 votes. In the wake of his second statewide defeat in three years, Polk faced an uncertain political future.

Despite his loss, Polk was determined to become the next <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President of the United States</a>, seeing it as a path to the presidency. Van Buren was the frontrunner for the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201844">1844</a> Democratic nomination, and Polk engaged in a careful campaign to become his running mate. The former president faced opposition from Southerners who feared his views on slavery, while his handling of the Panic of 1837—he had refused to rescind the Specie Circular—aroused opposition from some in the West (today's Midwest) who believed his hard money policies had hurt their section of the country. Many Southerners backed Calhoun's candidacy, Westerners rallied around Senator <a href="Lewis%20Cass">Lewis Cass</a> of Michigan, and former Vice President Johnson also maintained a strong following among Democrats. Jackson assured Van Buren by letter that Polk in his campaigns for governor had "fought the battle well and fought it alone". Polk hoped to gain Van Buren's support, hinting in a letter that a Van Buren/Polk ticket could carry Tennessee, but found him unconvinced.

The biggest political issue in the United States at that time was territorial expansion. The <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a> had <a href="Texas%20Revolution">successfully revolted</a> against Mexico in 1836. With the republic largely populated by American emigres, those on both sides of the <a href="Sabine%20River%20%28Texas%E2%80%93Louisiana%29">Sabine River</a> border between the U.S. and Texas deemed it inevitable that Texas would join the United States, but this would anger Mexico, which considered Texas a breakaway province, and threatened war if the United States annexed it. Jackson, as president, had recognized Texas independence, but the initial momentum toward annexation had stalled. Britain was seeking to expand her influence in Texas: Britain had abolished slavery, and if Texas did the same, it would provide a western haven for runaways to match one in the North. A Texas not in the United States would also stand in the way of what was deemed America's <a href="Manifest%20Destiny">Manifest Destiny</a> to overspread the continent.

Clay was nominated for president by acclamation at the April <a href="1844%20Whig%20National%20Convention">1844 Whig National Convention</a>, with New Jersey's <a href="Theodore%20Frelinghuysen">Theodore Frelinghuysen</a> his running mate. A Kentucky slaveholder at a time when opponents of <a href="Texas%20annexation">Texas annexation</a> argued that it would give slavery more room to spread, Clay sought a nuanced position on the issue. Jackson, who strongly supported a Van Buren/Polk ticket, was delighted when Clay issued a letter for publication in the newspapers opposing Texas annexation, only to be devastated when he learned Van Buren had done the same thing. Van Buren did this because he feared losing his base of support in the Northeast, but his supporters in the <a href="old%20Southwest">old Southwest</a> were stunned at his action. Polk, on the other hand, had written a pro-annexation letter that had been published four days before Van Buren's. Jackson wrote sadly to Van Buren that no candidate who opposed annexation could be elected, and decided Polk was the best person to head the ticket. Jackson met with Polk at the Hermitage on May 13, 1844 and explained to his visitor that only an expansionist from the South or Southwest could be elected—and, in his view, Polk had the best chance. Polk was at first startled, calling the plan "utterly abortive", but he agreed to accept it. Polk immediately wrote to instruct his lieutenants at the convention to work for his nomination as president.

Despite Jackson's quiet efforts on his behalf, Polk was skeptical that he could win. Nevertheless, because of the opposition to Van Buren by expansionists in the West and South, Polk's key lieutenant at the <a href="1844%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1844 Democratic National Convention</a> in Baltimore, <a href="Gideon%20Johnson%20Pillow">Gideon Johnson Pillow</a>, believed Polk could emerge as a compromise candidate. Publicly, Polk, who remained in Columbia during the convention, professed full support for Van Buren's candidacy, and was believed to be seeking the vice presidency. Polk was one of the few major Democrats to have declared for the annexation of Texas.

The convention opened on May 27, 1844. A crucial question was whether the nominee needed two-thirds of the delegate vote, as had been the case at previous Democratic conventions, or merely a majority. A vote for two-thirds would doom Van Buren's candidacy due to the opposition to him. With the support of the Southern states, the two-thirds rule was passed. Van Buren won a majority on the first presidential ballot, but failed to win the necessary two-thirds, and his support slowly faded on subsequent ballots. Cass, Johnson, Calhoun and <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a> had also received votes on the first ballot, and Cass took the lead on the fifth ballot. After seven ballots, the convention remained deadlocked: Cass could not attract the support necessary to reach two-thirds, and Van Buren's supporters were more and more discouraged about the former president's chances. Delegates were ready to consider a new candidate who might break the stalemate.

When the convention adjourned after the seventh ballot, Pillow, who had been waiting for an opportunity to press Polk's name, conferred with <a href="George%20Bancroft">George Bancroft</a> of Massachusetts, a politician and historian who was a longtime Polk correspondent, and who had planned to nominate Polk for vice president. Bancroft had supported Van Buren's candidacy, and was willing to see New York Senator <a href="Silas%20Wright">Silas Wright</a> head the ticket, but Wright would not consider taking a nomination that Van Buren wanted. Pillow and Bancroft decided if Polk were nominated for president, Wright might accept the second spot. Before the eighth ballot, former Attorney General <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%20Butler%20%28lawyer%29">Benjamin F. Butler</a>, head of the New York delegation, read a pre-written letter from Van Buren to be used if he could not be nominated, withdrawing in Wright's favor. But Wright (who was in Washington) had also entrusted a pre-written letter to a supporter, in which he refused to be considered as a presidential candidate, and stated in the letter that he agreed with Van Buren's position on Texas. Had Wright's letter not been read he most likely would have been nominated, but without him, Butler began to rally Van Buren supporters for Polk as the best possible candidate, and Bancroft placed Polk's name before the convention. On the eighth ballot, Polk received only 44 votes to Cass's 114 and Van Buren's 104, but the deadlock showed signs of breaking. Butler formally withdrew Van Buren's name, many delegations declared for the Tennessean, and on the ninth ballot Polk received 233 ballots to Cass's 29, making him the Democratic nominee for president. The nomination was then made unanimous.

This left the question of the vice presidential candidate. Butler urged Wright's nomination, and the convention agreed to this, with only eight Georgia delegates dissenting. As the convention waited, word of Wright's nomination was sent to him in Washington via <a href="telegraph">telegraph</a>. Having by proxy declined an almost certain presidential nomination, Wright would not accept the second place. Senator <a href="Robert%20J.%20Walker">Robert J. Walker</a> of Mississippi, a close Polk ally, suggested former senator <a href="George%20M.%20Dallas">George M. Dallas</a> of Pennsylvania. Dallas was acceptable enough to all factions, and gained the vice presidential nomination on the second ballot. The delegates passed a platform, and adjourned on May 30.

Although many contemporary politicians, including Pillow and Bancroft, claimed credit in the years to come for getting Polk the nomination, Walter R. Borneman felt that most credit was due to Jackson and Polk, "the two who had done the most were back in Tennessee, one an aging icon ensconced at the Hermitage and the other a shrewd lifelong politician waiting expectantly in Columbia". Whigs mocked Polk with the chant "Who is James K. Polk?", affecting never to have heard of him. Though he had experience as Speaker of the House and Governor of Tennessee, all previous presidents had served as Vice President, Secretary of State, or as a high-ranking general. Polk has been described as the first "<a href="dark%20horse">dark horse</a>" presidential nominee, although his nomination was less of a surprise than that of future nominees such as <a href="Franklin%20Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a> or <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a>. Despite his party's gibes, Clay recognized that Polk could unite the Democrats.

Rumors of Polk's nomination reached Nashville on June 4, much to Jackson's delight; they were substantiated later that day. The dispatches were sent on to Columbia, arriving the same day, and letters and newspapers describing what had happened at Baltimore were in Polk's hands by June 6. He accepted his nomination by letter dated June 12, alleging that he had never sought the office, and stating his intent to serve only one term. Wright was embittered by what he called the "foul plot" against Van Buren, and demanded assurances that Polk had played no part; it was only after Polk professed that he had remained loyal to Van Buren that Wright supported his campaign. Following the custom of the time that presidential candidates avoid electioneering or appearing to seek the office, Polk remained in Columbia and made no speeches. He engaged in an extensive correspondence with Democratic Party officials as he managed his campaign. Polk made his views known in his acceptance letter and through responses to questions sent by citizens that were printed in newspapers, often by arrangement.

A potential pitfall for Polk's campaign was the issue of whether the tariff should be for revenue only, or with the intent to protect American industry. Polk finessed the tariff issue in a published letter. Recalling that he had long stated that tariffs should only be sufficient to finance government operations, he maintained that stance, but wrote that within that limitation, government could and should offer "fair and just protection" to American interests, including manufacturers. He refused to expand on this stance, acceptable to most Democrats, despite the Whigs pointing out that he had committed himself to nothing. In September, a delegation of Whigs from nearby <a href="Giles%20County%2C%20Tennessee">Giles County</a> came to Columbia, armed with specific questions on Polk's views regarding the current tariff, the Whig-passed <a href="Tariff%20of%201842">Tariff of 1842</a>, and with the stated intent of remaining in Columbia until they got answers. Polk took several days to respond, and chose to stand by his earlier statement, provoking an outcry in the Whig papers.

Another concern was the third-party candidacy of President Tyler, which might split the Democratic vote. Tyler had been nominated by a group of loyal officeholders. Under no illusions he could win, he believed he could rally states' rights supporters and populists to hold the balance of power in the election. Only Jackson had the stature to resolve the situation, which he did with two letters to friends in the Cabinet, that he knew would be shown to Tyler, stating that the President's supporters would be welcomed back into the Democratic fold. Jackson wrote that once Tyler withdrew, many Democrats would embrace him for his pro-annexation stance. The former president also used his influence to stop <a href="Francis%20Preston%20Blair">Francis Preston Blair</a> and his "Globe" newspaper, the semi-official organ of the Democratic Party, from attacking Tyler. These proved enough; Tyler withdrew from the race in August.

Party troubles were a third concern. Polk and Calhoun made peace when a former South Carolina congressman, <a href="Francis%20Pickens">Francis Pickens</a> visited Tennessee and came to Columbia for two days and to the Hermitage for sessions with the increasingly ill Jackson. Calhoun wanted the "Globe" dissolved, and that Polk would act against the 1842 tariff and promote Texas annexation. Reassured on these points, Calhoun became a strong supporter.

Polk was aided regarding Texas when Clay, realizing his anti-annexation letter had cost him support, attempted in two subsequent letters to clarify his position. These angered both sides, which attacked Clay as insincere. Texas also threatened to divide the Democrats sectionally, but Polk managed to appease most Southern party leaders without antagonizing Northern ones. As the election drew closer, it became clear that most of the country favored the annexation of Texas, and some Southern Whig leaders supported Polk's campaign due to Clay's anti-annexation stance.

The campaign was vitriolic; both major party candidates were accused of various acts of malfeasance; Polk was accused of being both a duelist and a coward. The most damaging smear was the <a href="black%20propaganda%23United%20States%20media">Roorback forgery</a>; in late August an item appeared in an <a href="abolitionist">abolitionist</a> newspaper, part of a book detailing fictional travels through the South of a Baron von Roorback, an imaginary German nobleman. The Ithaca "Chronicle" printed it without labeling it as fiction, and inserted a sentence alleging that the traveler had seen forty slaves who had been sold by Polk after being branded with his initials. The item was withdrawn by the "Chronicle" when challenged by the Democrats, but it was widely reprinted. Borneman suggested that the forgery backfired on Polk's opponents as it served to remind voters that Clay too was a slaveholder, <a href="John%20Eisenhower">John Eisenhower</a>, in his journal article on the election, stated that the smear came too late to be effectively rebutted, and likely cost Polk Ohio. Southern newspapers, on the other hand, went far in defending Polk, one Nashville newspaper alleging that his slaves preferred their bondage to freedom. Polk himself implied to newspaper correspondents that the only slaves he owned had either been inherited or had been purchased from relatives in financial distress; this paternalistic image was also painted by surrogates like Gideon Pillow. This was not true, though not known at the time; by then he had bought over thirty slaves, both from relatives and others, mainly for the purpose of procuring labor for his Mississippi cotton plantation.

There was no uniform election day in 1844; states voted between November 1 and 12. Polk won the election with 49.5% of the popular vote and 170 of the 275 electoral votes. Becoming the first president elected despite losing his state of residence (Tennessee), Polk also lost his birth state, North Carolina. However, he won Pennsylvania and New York, where Clay lost votes to the antislavery Liberty Party candidate <a href="James%20G.%20Birney">James G. Birney</a>, who got more votes in New York than Polk's margin of victory. Had Clay won New York, he would have been elected president.

Polk presided over a country whose population had doubled every twenty years since the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a> and which had reached demographic parity with <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>. Polk's tenure saw continued technological improvements, including the continued expansion of <a href="railroad">railroad</a>s and increased use of the <a href="telegraph">telegraph</a>. These improved communications and growing demographics increasingly made the United States into a strong military power, while also stoking <a href="expansionism">expansionism</a>.

Polk set four clearly defined goals for his administration:

While his domestic aims represented continuity with past Democratic policies, successful completion of Polk's foreign policy goals would represent the first major <a href="United%20States%20territorial%20acquisitions">American territorial gains</a> since the <a href="Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs%20Treaty">Adams–Onís Treaty</a> of 1819.

After being informed of his victory on November 15, 1844, Polk turned his attention to forming a geographically-balanced Cabinet. He consulted Jackson and one or two other close allies, and decided that the large states of New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia should have representation in the six-member Cabinet, as should his home state of Tennessee. At a time when an incoming president might retain some or all of his predecessor's department heads, Polk wanted an entirely fresh Cabinet, but this proved delicate. Tyler's final Secretary of State was Calhoun, leader of a considerable faction of the Democratic Party, but, when approached by emissaries, he did not take offense and was willing to step down.

Polk did not want his Cabinet to contain presidential hopefuls, though he chose to nominate <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a> of Pennsylvania, whose ambition for the presidency was well-known, as Secretary of State. Tennessee's <a href="Cave%20Johnson">Cave Johnson</a>, a close friend and ally of Polk, was nominated for the position of Postmaster General, with George Bancroft, the historian who had placed a crucial role in Polk's nomination as Navy Secretary. Polk's choices met with the approval of Andrew Jackson, whom Polk met with in January 1845 for the last time, as Jackson died that June.

Tyler's last Navy Secretary, <a href="John%20Y.%20Mason">John Y. Mason</a> of Virginia, Polk's friend since college days and a longtime political ally, was not on the original list. As Cabinet choices were affected by factional politics and President Tyler's drive to resolve the Texas issue before leaving office, Polk at the last minute chose him as Attorney General. Polk also chose Mississippi Senator Walker as Secretary of the Treasury and New York's <a href="William%20Marcy">William Marcy</a> as Secretary of War. All gained Senate confirmation after Polk took office. The members worked well together, and few replacements were necessary. One reshuffle was required in 1846 when Bancroft, who wanted a diplomatic posting, became <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom">U.S. minister to Britain</a>.

As Polk put together his Cabinet, President Tyler sought to complete the annexation of Texas. While the Senate had defeated an earlier treaty that would annex the republic, Tyler urged Congress to pass a joint resolution, relying on its constitutional power to admit states. There were disagreements about the terms under which Texas would be admitted and Polk became involved in negotiations to break the impasse. With Polk's help, the annexation resolution narrowly cleared the Senate. Tyler was unsure whether to sign the resolution or leave it for Polk, and sent Calhoun to consult with the <a href="President-elect%20of%20the%20United%20States">President-elect</a>, who declined to give any advice. On his final evening in office, March 3, 1845, Tyler offered annexation to Texas according to the terms of the resolution.

Even before his inauguration, Polk wrote to Cave Johnson, "I intend to be President of the U.S." He would gain a reputation as a hard worker, spending ten to twelve hours at his desk, and rarely leaving Washington. Polk wrote, "No President who performs his duty faithfully and conscientiously can have any leisure. I prefer to supervise the whole operations of the government myself rather than intrust the public business to subordinates, and this makes my duties very great." When he took office on March 4, 1845, Polk, at 49, became the <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States%20by%20age">youngest president</a> to that point. Polk's inauguration was the first <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20inauguration">inaugural ceremony</a> to be reported by telegraph, and first to be shown in a newspaper illustration (in "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20London%20News">The Illustrated London News</a>").

In his inaugural address, delivered in a steady rain, Polk made clear his support for annexation by referring to the 28 states, thus including Texas. He proclaimed his fidelity to Jackson's principles by quoting his famous toast, "Every lover of his country must shudder at the thought of the possibility of its dissolution and will be ready to adopt the patriotic sentiment, 'Our Federal Union—it must be preserved.'" He stated his opposition to a national bank, and repeated that the tariff could include incidental protection. Although he did not mention slavery specifically, he alluded to it, decrying those who would tear down an institution protected by the Constitution.

Polk devoted the second half of his speech to foreign affairs, and specifically to expansion. He applauded the annexation of Texas, warning that Texas was no affair of any other nation, and certainly none of Mexico's. He spoke of the Oregon Country, and of the many who were migrating, pledging to safeguard America's rights there, and to protect the settlers.

As well as appointing Cabinet officers to advise him, Polk made his sister's son, <a href="Joseph%20Knox%20Walker">J. Knox Walker</a>, his <a href="Secretary%20to%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">personal secretary</a>, an especially important position because, other than his slaves, Polk had no staff at the White House. Walker, who lived at the White House with his growing family (two children were born to him while living there), performed his duties competently through his uncle's presidency. Other Polk relatives visited at the White House, some for extended periods.

Britain derived its claim to the Oregon Country from the voyages of Captains <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a> and <a href="George%20Vancouver">George Vancouver</a>, the Americans from the explorations of the <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20expedition">Lewis and Clark expedition</a> and from the discovery of the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> by the American sea captain, <a href="Robert%20Gray%20%28sea%20captain%29">Robert Gray</a>. By treaty, Russia had waived any claim south of the southern border of Alaska, which it possessed until 1867, and Spain, which until the <a href="Mexican%20Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a> owned the Pacific Coast to the <a href="42nd%20parallel%20north">42nd parallel</a>, ceded any claims it might have north of that to the United States under the <a href="Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs%20Treaty">Adams–Onís Treaty</a> of 1819.

Rather than war over the distant and low-population territory, the United States and Britain had negotiated. Since the signing of the <a href="Treaty%20of%201818">Treaty of 1818</a>, the Oregon Country had been under the joint occupation and control of the United Kingdom and the United States. Previous U.S. administrations had offered to divide the region along the <a href="49th%20parallel%20north">49th parallel</a>, which was not acceptable to Britain, as it had commercial interests along the Columbia River. Britain's preferred partition was unacceptable to Polk, as it would have awarded <a href="Puget%20Sound">Puget Sound</a> and all lands north of the Columbia River to Britain, and Britain was unwilling to accept the 49th parallel extended to the Pacific, as it meant the entire opening to Puget Sound would be in American hands, isolating its settlements along the <a href="Fraser%20River">Fraser River</a>. <a href="Edward%20Everett">Edward Everett</a>, President Tyler's ambassador to Great Britain, had informally proposed dividing the territory at the 49th parallel with the strategic <a href="Vancouver%20Island">Vancouver Island</a> granted to the British, thus allowing an opening to the Pacific, but when the new British minister in Washington, <a href="Richard%20Pakenham">Richard Pakenham</a> arrived in 1844 prepared to follow up, he found that many Americans desired the entire territory. Oregon had not been a major issue in the 1844 election, but the heavy influx of settlers, mostly American, to the Oregon Country in 1845, and the rising spirit of expansionism in the United States as Texas and Oregon seized the public's eye, made a treaty with Britain more urgent. Many Democrats believed that the United States should span from coast to coast, a philosophy described as <a href="Manifest%20Destiny">Manifest Destiny</a>.

Though both sides sought an acceptable compromise, each also saw the territory as an important geopolitical asset that would play a large part in determining the dominant power in North America. In his inaugural address, Polk announced that he viewed the American claim to the land as "clear and unquestionable", provoking threats of war from British leaders should Polk attempt to take control of the entire territory. Polk had refrained in his address from asserting a claim to the entire territory, which extended north to 54 degrees, 40 minutes north latitude, although the Democratic Party platform called for such a claim. Despite Polk's hawkish rhetoric, he viewed war over Oregon as unwise, and Polk and Buchanan began negotiations with the British. Like his predecessors, Polk again proposed a division along the 49th parallel, which was immediately rejected by Pakenham. Secretary of State Buchanan was wary of a two-front war with Mexico and Britain, but Polk was willing to risk war with both countries in pursuit of a favorable settlement. In his annual message to Congress in December 1845, Polk requested approval of giving Britain a one-year notice (as required in the Treaty of 1818) of his intention to terminate the joint occupancy of Oregon. In that message, he quoted from the <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine">Monroe Doctrine</a> to denote America's intention of keeping European powers out, the first significant use of it since its origin in 1823. After much debate, Congress eventually passed the resolution in April 1846, attaching its hope that the dispute would be settled amicably.

When the British Foreign Secretary, <a href="George%20Hamilton-Gordon%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Aberdeen">Lord Aberdeen</a>, learned of the proposal rejected by Pakenham, Aberdeen asked the United States to re-open negotiations, but Polk was unwilling unless a proposal was made by the British. With Britain moving towards free trade with the <a href="repeal%20of%20the%20Corn%20Laws">repeal of the Corn Laws</a>, good trade relations with the United States were more important to Aberdeen than a distant territory. In February 1846, Polk allowed Buchanan to inform <a href="Louis%20McLane">Louis McLane</a>, the American ambassador to Britain, that Polk's administration would look favorably on a British proposal based around a division at the 49th parallel. In June 1846, Pakenham presented an offer to the Polk administration, calling for a boundary line at the 49th parallel, with the exception that Britain would retain all of Vancouver Island, and there would be limited navigation rights for British subjects on the Columbia River until the expiration of the charter of the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> in 1859. Polk and most of his Cabinet were prepared to accept the proposal, but Buchanan, in a reversal, urged that the United States seek control of all of the Oregon Territory. Polk deemed Buchanan's about-face linked to his presidential ambitions.

After winning the reluctant approval of Buchanan, and choosing to have the Senate weigh in (favorably) on the draft treaty, Polk submitted the full treaty to the Senate for ratification. The Senate ratified the <a href="Oregon%20Treaty">Oregon Treaty</a> in a 41–14 vote, with opposition from diehards who sought the full territory. Polk's willingness to risk war with Britain had frightened many, but his tough negotiation tactics may have gained the United States concessions from the British (particularly regarding the Columbia River) that a more conciliatory president might not have won.

The annexation resolution signed by Tyler gave the president the choice of asking Texas to approve annexation, or reopening negotiations; Tyler immediately sent a messenger to the <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20Texas">U.S. representative in Texas</a>, <a href="Andrew%20Jackson%20Donelson">Andrew Jackson Donelson</a>, choosing the former option. Thus, Polk's first major decision in office was whether to recall Tyler's courier to Texas.

Though it was within Polk's power to recall the messenger, he chose to allow him to continue, with the hope that Texas would accept the offer. He also sent Congressman <a href="Archibald%20Yell">Archibald Yell</a> of Arkansas as his personal emissary, taking his private assurance that the United States would defend Texas, and would fix its southern border at the <a href="Rio%20Grande">Rio Grande</a>, as claimed by Texas, rather than at the <a href="Nueces%20River">Nueces River</a>, as claimed by Mexico. Polk retained Donelson in his post, and the diplomat sought to convince Texas' leaders to accept annexation under the terms proposed by the Tyler administration. Though public sentiment in Texas favored annexation, some leaders, including President <a href="Anson%20Jones">Anson Jones</a>, hoped negotiation would bring better terms. Britain had offered to work a deal whereby Texas would gain Mexican recognition in exchange for a pledge never to annex itself to another country, but after consideration, the influential former president, <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a>, rejected it, as did the <a href="Texas%20Congress">Texas Congress</a>.

In July 1845, a convention ratified annexation, and thereafter voters approved it. In December 1845, Polk signed a resolution annexing Texas, and it became the 28th state. Mexico had broken diplomatic relations with the United States on passage of the joint resolution in March 1845; annexation increased tensions with that nation, which had never recognized Texan independence.

Following the Texan ratification of annexation in 1845, both Mexicans and Americans saw conflict as a likely possibility. Polk began preparations for a potential war with Mexico over Texas, sending an army led by Brigadier General <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> into Texas. Taylor and Commodore <a href="David%20Conner%20%28naval%20officer%29">David Conner</a> of the U.S. Navy, commanding American ships off the Mexican coast, were both ordered to avoid provoking a war, while preparing for conflict, and to respond to any Mexican aggression. Although Polk had the military prepare for war, he did not believe it would come to that; he thought Mexico would give in under duress.

Polk hoped that a show of force by the U.S. military under Taylor and Conner could avert war and lead to negotiations with the Mexican government. In late 1845, Polk sent diplomat <a href="John%20Slidell">John Slidell</a> to Mexico to purchase New Mexico and California for $20–40 million, as well as securing Mexico's agreement to a Rio Grande border. Slidell arrived in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a> in December 1845. Mexican President <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Joaqu%C3%ADn%20de%20Herrera">José Joaquín de Herrera</a> was unwilling to receive him because of the hostility of the public towards the United States. Slidell's ambassadorial credentials were refused by a Mexican council of government, and Herrara soon thereafter was deposed by a military coup led by General <a href="Mariano%20Paredes%20%28President%20of%20Mexico%29">Mariano Paredes</a>, a hard-liner who pledged to take back Texas from the United States. Dispatches from Slidell and from the U.S. consul in Mexico City, <a href="John%20Black%20%28U.S.%20Senator%29">John Black</a>, made clear their views that U.S. aims for territorial expansion could not be accomplished without war.

Taylor's instructions were to repel any incursion by Mexico north of the Rio Grande, but initially, his army did not advance further than <a href="Corpus%20Christi%2C%20Texas">Corpus Christi</a>, at the mouth of the Nueces. On January 13, 1846, Polk ordered Taylor to proceed to the Rio Grande, though it took him time to prepare for the march. Polk was convinced that sending Taylor to the <a href="Nueces%20Strip">Nueces Strip</a> would prompt war; even if it did not, he was prepared to have Congress declare it. As he waited, Polk considered supporting a potential coup led by the exiled Mexican General <a href="Antonio%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Santa%20Anna">Antonio López de Santa Anna</a> with the hope that Santa Anna would sell parts of California.

Slidell returned to Washington in May 1846 and gave his opinion that negotiations with the Mexican government were unlikely to be successful. Polk regarded the treatment of his diplomat as an insult and an "ample cause of war", and he prepared to ask Congress for a declaration of war. Meanwhile, in late March, General Taylor had reached the Rio Grande, and his army camped across the river from <a href="Matamoros%2C%20Tamaulipas">Matamoros, Tamaulipas</a>. In April, after Mexican general <a href="Pedro%20de%20Ampudia">Pedro de Ampudia</a> demanded that Taylor return to the Nueces River, Taylor began a blockade of Matamoros. A skirmish on the northern side of the Rio Grande on April 25 ended in the death or capture of dozens of American soldiers, and became known as the <a href="Thornton%20Affair">Thornton Affair</a>. Word did not reach Washington until May 9, and Polk immediately convened the Cabinet and obtained their approval of his plan to send a war message to Congress on the ground that Mexico had, as Polk put it in his message, "shed American blood on the American soil". Polk's message was crafted to present the war as a just and necessary defense of the country against a neighbor that had long troubled the United States.

The House overwhelmingly approved a resolution declaring war and authorizing the president to accept 50,000 volunteers into the military. Some of those voting in favor were unconvinced that the U.S. had just cause to go to war, but feared to be deemed unpatriotic. In the Senate, war opponents led by Calhoun also questioned Polk's version of events. Nonetheless, the House resolution passed the Senate in a 40–2 vote, with Calhoun abstaining, marking the beginning of the Mexican–American War.

After the initial skirmishes, Taylor and much of his army marched away from the river to secure the supply line, leaving a makeshift base, <a href="Fort%20Texas">Fort Texas</a>. On the way back to the Rio Grande, Mexican forces under General <a href="Mariano%20Arista">Mariano Arista</a> attempted to block Taylor's way as other troops <a href="Siege%20of%20Fort%20Texas">laid siege to Fort Texas</a>, forcing the American general to the attack if he hoped to relieve the fort. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Palo%20Alto">Battle of Palo Alto</a>, the first major engagement of the war, Taylor's troops forced Arista's from the field, suffering only four dead to hundreds for the Mexicans. The next day, Taylor led the army to victory in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Resaca%20de%20la%20Palma">Battle of Resaca de la Palma</a>, putting the Mexican Army to rout. The early successes boosted support for the war, which despite the lopsided votes in Congress had deeply divided the nation. Many Northern Whigs opposed the war, as did others; they felt Polk had used patriotism to manipulate the nation into fighting a war the goal of which was to give slavery room to expand.

Polk distrusted the two senior officers, <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a> and Taylor, as both were Whigs, and would have replaced them with Democrats, but felt Congress would not approve it. He offered Scott the position of top commander in the war, which the general accepted. Polk and Scott already knew and disliked each other: the President made the appointment despite the fact that Scott had sought his party's presidential nomination in 1840. Polk came to believe that Scott was too slow in getting himself and his army away from Washington and to the Rio Grande, and was outraged to learn Scott was using his influence in Congress to defeat the administration's plan to expand the number of generals. The news of Taylor's victory at Resaca de la Palma arrived then, and Polk decided to have Taylor take command in the field, and Scott to remain in Washington. Polk also ordered Commodore Conner to allow Santa Anna to return to Mexico from his exile in Havana, and sent an army expedition led by <a href="Stephen%20W.%20Kearny">Stephen W. Kearny</a> towards Santa Fe.

In 1845, Polk, fearful of French or British intervention, had sent Lieutenant <a href="Archibald%20H.%20Gillespie">Archibald H. Gillespie</a> to California with orders to foment a pro-American rebellion that could be used to justify annexation of the territory. After meeting with Gillespie, Army captain <a href="John%20C.%20Fr%C3%A9mont">John C. Frémont</a> led settlers in northern California to overthrow the Mexican garrison in <a href="Sonoma%2C%20California">Sonoma</a> in what became known as the <a href="California%20Republic">Bear Flag Revolt</a>. In August 1846, American forces under Kearny captured Santa Fe, capital of the province of <a href="Santa%20Fe%20de%20Nuevo%20M%C3%A9xico">New Mexico</a>, without firing a shot. Almost simultaneously, Commodore <a href="Robert%20F.%20Stockton">Robert F. Stockton</a> landed in <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles</a> and proclaimed the capture of California. After American forces put down a revolt, the United States held effective control of New Mexico and California. Nevertheless, the Western theater of the war would prove to be a political headache for Polk, as a dispute between Frémont and Kearny led to a break between Polk and the powerful Missouri senator (and father-in-law of Frémont), <a href="Thomas%20Hart%20Benton%20%28politician%29">Thomas Hart Benton</a>.

The initial public euphoria over the victories at the start of the war slowly dissipated. In August 1846, Polk asked Congress to appropriate $2 million as a down payment for the potential purchase of Mexican lands. Polk's request ignited opposition, as he had never before made public his desire to annex parts of Mexico (aside from lands claimed by Texas). It was unclear whether such newly acquired lands would be slave or free, and there was angry sectional debate. A freshman Democratic Congressman, <a href="David%20Wilmot">David Wilmot</a> of Pennsylvania, previously a firm supporter of Polk's administration, offered an amendment to the bill—the "<a href="Wilmot%20Proviso">Wilmot Proviso</a>"—that would ban slavery in any land acquired using the money. The appropriation bill, with the Wilmot Proviso attached, passed the House, but died in the Senate. This discord cost Polk's party, as Democrats lost control of the House in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201846">1846 elections</a>. In early 1847, though, Polk was successful in passing a bill raising further regiments, and he also finally won approval for the appropriation.

In July 1846, American envoy <a href="Alexander%20Slidell%20Mackenzie">Alexander Slidell Mackenzie</a> had met with Santa Anna, offering terms by which the US would pay to acquire <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a> and other parts of Alta California. Santa Anna seemed receptive, but after returning to Mexico, taking control of the government, he stated that he would fight against the Americans, and placed himself at the head of the army. This caused Polk to harden his position on Mexico, and he ordered an American landing at <a href="Veracruz%20%28city%29">Veracruz</a>, the most important Mexican port on the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. From there, troops were to march to Mexico City, which it was hoped would end the war. Continuing to advance in northeast Mexico, Taylor defeated a Mexican army led by Ampudia in the September 1846 <a href="Battle%20of%20Monterrey">Battle of Monterrey</a>, but allowed Ampudia's forces to withdraw from the town, much to Polk's consternation. Polk believed Taylor had not aggressively pursued the enemy, and reluctantly offered command of the Veracruz expedition to Scott.

The lack of trust Polk had in Taylor was returned by the Whig general, who feared the partisan president was trying to destroy him. Accordingly, Taylor disobeyed orders to remain near Monterrey. In March 1847, Polk learned that Taylor had continued to march south, capturing the northern Mexican town of <a href="Saltillo">Saltillo</a>. Continuing beyond Saltillo, Taylor's army decimated a larger Mexican force, led by Santa Anna, in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Buena%20Vista">Battle of Buena Vista</a>. Mexican casualties were five times that of the Americans, and the victory made Taylor even more of a military hero in the public's eyes, though Polk preferred to credit the bravery of the soldiers rather than the Whig general. In March 1847, Scott landed in Veracruz, and quickly <a href="Siege%20of%20Veracruz">won control</a> of the city. With the capture of Veracruz, Polk dispatched <a href="Nicholas%20Trist">Nicholas Trist</a>, Buchanan's chief clerk, to accompany Scott's army and negotiate a peace treaty with Mexican leaders. Trist was instructed to seek the cession of Alta California, New Mexico, and <a href="Baja%20California%20Peninsula">Baja California</a>, recognition of the Rio Grande as the southern border of Texas, and American access across the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Tehuantepec">Isthmus of Tehuantepec</a>. Trist was authorized to make a payment of up to $30 million in exchange for these concessions.

In August 1847, as he advanced towards Mexico City, Scott defeated Santa Anna at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Contreras">Battle of Contreras</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Churubusco">Battle of Churubusco</a>. With the Americans at the gates of Mexico City, Trist negotiated with commissioners, but the Mexicans were willing to give up little. Scott prepared <a href="Battle%20for%20Mexico%20City">to take Mexico City</a>, which he did in mid-September. In the United States, a heated political debate emerged regarding how much of Mexico the United States should seek to annex, Whigs such as Henry Clay arguing that the United States should only seek to settle the Texas border question, and some expansionists arguing for the <a href="All%20of%20Mexico%20Movement">annexation of all of Mexico</a>. War opponents were also active; Whig Congressman <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> of Illinois introduced the "exact spot" resolutions, calling on Polk to state exactly where American blood had been shed on American soil to start the war, but the House refused to consider them.

Frustrated by a lack of progress in negotiations, Polk ordered Trist to return to Washington, but the diplomat, when the notice of recall arrived in mid-November 1847, decided to remain, writing a lengthy letter to Polk the following month to justify his decision. Polk considered having Butler, designated as Scott's replacement, forcibly remove him from Mexico City. Though outraged by Trist's decision, Polk decided to allow him some time to negotiate a treaty.

Throughout January 1848, Trist regularly met with officials in Mexico City, though at the request of the Mexicans, the treaty signing took place in Guadalupe Hidalgo, a small town near Mexico City. Trist was willing to allow Mexico to keep Baja California, as his instructions allowed, but successfully haggled for the inclusion of the important harbor of <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a> in a cession of Alta California. Provisions included the Rio Grande border and a $15 million payment to Mexico. On February 2, 1848, Trist and the Mexican delegation signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Guadalupe%20Hidalgo">Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</a>. Polk received the document on February 19, and, after the Cabinet met on the 20th, decided he had no choice but to accept it. If he turned it down, with the House by then controlled by the Whigs, there was no assurance Congress would vote funding to continue the war. Both Buchanan and Walker dissented, wanting more land from Mexico, a position with which the President was sympathetic, though he considered Buchanan's view motivated by his ambition.

Some senators opposed the treaty because they wanted to take no Mexican territory; others hesitated because of the irregular nature of Trist's negotiations. Polk waited in suspense for two weeks as the Senate considered it, sometimes hearing that it would likely be defeated, and that Buchanan and Walker were working against it. He was relieved when the two Cabinet officers lobbied on behalf of the treaty. On March 10, the Senate ratified the treaty in a 38–14 vote, on a vote that cut across partisan and geographic lines. The Senate made some modifications to the treaty before ratification, and Polk worried that the Mexican government would reject them. On June 7, Polk learned that Mexico had ratified the treaty. Polk declared the treaty in effect as of July 4, 1848, thus ending the war. With the acquisition of California, Polk had accomplished all four of his major presidential goals. With the exception of the territory acquired by the 1853 <a href="Gadsden%20Purchase">Gadsden Purchase</a>, the territorial acquisitions under Polk established the modern borders of the <a href="Contiguous%20United%20States">Contiguous United States</a>.

Polk had been anxious to establish a territorial government for Oregon once the treaty was effective in 1846, but the matter became embroiled in the arguments over slavery, though few thought Oregon suitable for that institution. A bill to establish an Oregon territorial government passed the House after being amended to bar slavery; the bill died in the Senate when opponents ran out the clock on the congressional session. A resurrected bill, still barring slavery, again passed the House in January 1847 but it was not considered by the Senate before Congress adjourned in March. By the time Congress met again in December, California and New Mexico were in U.S. hands, and Polk in his annual message urged the establishment of territorial governments in all three. The <a href="Missouri%20Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a> had settled the issue of the geographic reach of slavery within the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a> territories by prohibiting slavery in states north of 36°30′ latitude, and Polk sought to extend this line into the newly acquired territory. If extended to the Pacific, this would have made slavery illegal in San Francisco, but allowed it in Monterey and Los Angeles. A plan to accomplish the extension was defeated in the House by a bipartisan alliance of Northerners. As the last congressional session before the 1848 election came to a close, Polk signed the lone territorial bill passed by Congress, which established the <a href="Oregon%20Territory">Territory of Oregon</a> and prohibited slavery in it.

When Congress reconvened in December 1848, Polk asked it in his annual message to establish territorial governments in California and New Mexico, a task made especially urgent by the onset of the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a>. The divisive issue of slavery blocked any such legislation, though congressional action continued until the final hours of Polk's term. When the bill was amended to have the laws of Mexico apply to the southwest territories until Congress changed them (thus effectively banning slavery), Polk made it clear that he would veto it, considering it the Wilmot Proviso in another guise. It was not until the <a href="Compromise%20of%201850">Compromise of 1850</a> that the matter of the territories was resolved.

Polk's ambassador to the <a href="Republic%20of%20New%20Granada">Republic of New Granada</a>, <a href="Benjamin%20Alden%20Bidlack">Benjamin Alden Bidlack</a>, negotiated the <a href="Mallarino%E2%80%93Bidlack%20Treaty">Mallarino–Bidlack Treaty</a>. Though Bidlack had initially only sought to remove tariffs on American goods, Bidlack and New Granadan Foreign Minister <a href="Manuel%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Mallarino">Manuel María Mallarino</a> negotiated a broader agreement that deepened military and trade ties between the two countries. The treaty also allowed for the construction of the <a href="Panama%20Canal%20Railway">Panama Railway</a>. In an era of slow overland travel, the treaty gave the United States a route for a quicker journey between its eastern and western coasts. In exchange, Bidlack agreed to have the United States guarantee New Granada's sovereignty over the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Panama">Isthmus of Panama</a>. The treaty won ratification in both countries in 1848. The agreement helped to establish a stronger American influence in the region, as the Polk administration sought to ensure that Great Britain would not dominate <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a>. The United States would use the rights granted under the Mallarino-Bidlack Treaty as a justification for its military interventions in Latin America through the remainder of the 19th century.

In mid-1848, President Polk authorized his ambassador to Spain, <a href="Romulus%20Mitchell%20Saunders">Romulus Mitchell Saunders</a>, to negotiate the purchase of <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> and offer <a href="Spain">Spain</a> up to $100 million, a large sum at the time for one territory, equal to $ in present-day terms. Cuba was close to the United States and had slavery, so the idea appealed to Southerners but was unwelcome in the North. However, Spain was still making profits in Cuba (notably in sugar, molasses, rum and tobacco), and thus the Spanish government rejected Saunders's overtures. Though Polk was eager to acquire Cuba, he refused to support the <a href="Filibuster%20%28military%29">filibuster</a> expedition of <a href="Narciso%20L%C3%B3pez">Narciso López</a>, who sought to invade and take over the island as a prelude to annexation.

In his inaugural address, Polk called upon Congress to re-establish the <a href="Independent%20Treasury">Independent Treasury</a> System under which government funds were held in the Treasury and not in banks or other financial institutions. President Van Buren had previously established a similar system, but it had been abolished during the Tyler administration. Polk made clear his opposition to a national bank in his inaugural address, and in his first annual message to Congress in December 1845, he called for the government to keep its funds itself. Congress was slow to act; the House passed a bill in April 1846 and the Senate in August, both without a single Whig vote. Polk signed the Independent Treasury Act into law on August 6, 1846. The act provided that the public revenues were to be retained in the <a href="Treasury%20Building%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29">Treasury building</a> and in sub-treasuries in various cities, separate from private or state banks. The system would remain in place until the passage of the <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20Act">Federal Reserve Act</a> in 1913.

Polk's other major domestic initiative was the lowering of the tariff. Polk directed Secretary of the Treasury Robert Walker to draft a new and lower tariff, which Polk submitted to Congress. After intense lobbying by both sides, the bill passed the House and, in a close vote that required Vice President Dallas to <a href="List%20of%20tie-breaking%20votes%20cast%20by%20vice%20presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">break a tie</a>, the Senate in July 1846. Dallas, although from protectionist Pennsylvania, voted for the bill, having decided his best political prospects lay in supporting the administration. Polk signed the <a href="Walker%20tariff">Walker Tariff</a> into law, substantially reducing the rates that had been set by the Tariff of 1842. The reduction of tariffs in the United States and the repeal of the Corn Laws in Great Britain led to a boom in Anglo-American trade.

Congress passed the <a href="Rivers%20and%20Harbors%20Bill">Rivers and Harbors Bill</a> in 1846 to provide $500,000 to improve port facilities, but Polk vetoed it. Polk believed that the bill was unconstitutional because it unfairly favored particular areas, including ports that had no foreign trade. Polk considered internal improvements to be matters for the states, and feared that passing the bill would encourage legislators to compete for favors for their home district—a type of <a href="Political%20corruption">corruption</a> that he felt would spell doom to the <a href="Republicanism%20in%20the%20United%20States">virtue of the republic</a>. In this regard he followed his hero Jackson, who had vetoed the <a href="Maysville%20Road%20veto">Maysville Road Bill</a> in 1830 on similar grounds.

Opposed by conviction to Federal funding for internal improvements, Polk stood strongly against all such bills. Congress, in 1847, passed another internal improvements bill; he <a href="pocket%20veto">pocket veto</a>ed it and sent Congress a full veto message when it met in December. Similar bills continued to advance in Congress in 1848, though none reached his desk. When he came to the Capitol to sign bills on March 3, 1849, the last day of the congressional session and his final full day in office, he feared that an internal improvements bill would pass Congress, and he brought with him a draft veto message. The bill did not pass, so it was not needed, but feeling the draft had been ably written, he had it preserved among his papers.
Authoritative word of the discovery of gold in California did not arrive in Washington until after the 1848 election, by which time Polk was a <a href="lame%20duck%20%28politics%29">lame duck</a>. Polk's political adversaries had claimed California was too far away to be useful, and was not worth the price paid to Mexico. The President was delighted by the news, seeing it as validation of his stance on expansion, and referred to the discovery several times in his final annual message to Congress that December. Shortly thereafter, actual samples of the California gold arrived, and Polk sent a special message to Congress on the subject. The message, confirming less authoritative reports, caused large numbers of people to move to California, both from the U.S. and abroad, thus helping to spark the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a>.

One of Polk's last acts as President was to sign the bill creating the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior">Department of the Interior</a> (March 3, 1849). This was the first new cabinet position created since the early days of the Republic. Polk had misgivings about the federal government usurping power over public lands from the states. Nevertheless, the delivery of the legislation on his last full day in office gave him no time to find constitutional grounds for a veto, or to draft a sufficient veto message, so he signed the bill.

Polk appointed the following justices to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Supreme Court</a>:

The 1844 death of Justice <a href="Henry%20Baldwin%20%28judge%29">Henry Baldwin</a> left a vacant place on the Supreme Court, but Tyler had been unable to get the Senate to confirm a nominee. At the time, it was the custom to have geographic balance on the Supreme Court, and Baldwin had been from Pennsylvania. Polk's efforts to fill Baldwin's seat became embroiled in Pennsylvania politics and the efforts of factional leaders to secure the lucrative post of Collector of Customs for the Port of Philadelphia. As Polk attempted to find his way through the minefield of Pennsylvania politics, a second position on the high court became vacant with the death, in September 1845, of Justice <a href="Joseph%20Story">Joseph Story</a>; his replacement was expected to come from his native New England. Because Story's death had occurred while the Senate was not in session, Polk was able to make a <a href="recess%20appointment">recess appointment</a>, choosing Senator <a href="Levi%20Woodbury">Levi Woodbury</a> of New Hampshire, and when the Senate reconvened in December 1845, Woodbury was confirmed. Polk's initial nominee for Baldwin's seat, <a href="George%20W.%20Woodward">George W. Woodward</a>, was rejected by the Senate in January 1846, in large part due to the opposition of Buchanan and Pennsylvania Senator <a href="Simon%20Cameron">Simon Cameron</a>.

Despite Polk's anger at Buchanan, he eventually offered the Secretary of State the seat, but Buchanan, after some indecision, turned it down. Polk subsequently nominated <a href="Robert%20Cooper%20Grier">Robert Cooper Grier</a> of Pittsburgh, who won confirmation. Justice Woodbury died in 1851, but Grier served until 1870 and in the slavery case of "<a href="Dred%20Scott%20v.%20Sandford">Dred Scott v. Sandford</a>" (1857) wrote an opinion stating that slaves were property and could not sue.

Polk appointed eight other federal judges, one to the <a href="United%20States%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia">United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia</a>, and seven to various <a href="United%20States%20district%20court">United States district court</a>s.

Honoring his pledge to serve only one term, Polk declined to seek re-election. At the <a href="1848%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1848 Democratic National Convention</a>, Cass led on every ballot, though it was not until the fourth that he attained a two-thirds vote. William Butler, who had replaced Winfield Scott as the commanding general in Mexico City, won the vice presidential nomination. The <a href="1848%20Whig%20National%20Convention">1848 Whig National Convention</a> nominated Taylor for president and former congressman <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a> of New York for vice president.

New York Democrats remained bitter because of what they deemed shabby treatment of Van Buren in 1844, and the former president had drifted from the party in the years since. Many of Van Buren's faction of the party, the <a href="Barnburners%20and%20Hunkers">Barnburners</a>, were younger men who strongly opposed the spread of slavery, a position with which, by 1848, Van Buren agreed. Senator Cass was a strong expansionist, and slavery might find new fields under him; accordingly the Barnburners bolted the Democratic National Convention upon his nomination, and, in June, joined by anti-slavery Democrats from other states, they held <a href="1848%20Free%20Soil%20%26amp%3B%20Liberty%20national%20Conventions">a convention</a>, nominating Van Buren for president. Polk was surprised and disappointed by his former ally's political conversion, and worried about the divisiveness of a sectional party organized around abolitionism. Polk did not give speeches for Cass, remaining at his desk at the White House. He did remove some Van Buren supporters from federal office during the campaign.

In the election, Taylor won 47.3% of the popular vote and a majority of the electoral vote. Cass won 42.5% of the vote, while Van Buren finished with 10.1% of the popular vote, much of his support coming from northern Democrats. Polk was disappointed by the outcome as he had a low opinion of Taylor, seeing the general as someone with poor judgment and few opinions on important public matters. Nevertheless, Polk observed tradition and welcomed President-elect Taylor to Washington, hosting him at a gala White House dinner. Polk departed the White House on March 3, leaving behind him a clean desk, though he worked from his hotel or the Capitol on last-minute appointments and bill signings. He attended Taylor's inauguration on March 5 (March 4, the presidential inauguration day until 1937, fell on a Sunday, and thus the ceremony was postponed a day), and though he was unimpressed with the new President, wished him the best.

Polk's time in the White House took its toll on his health. Full of enthusiasm and vigor when he entered office, Polk left the presidency exhausted by his years of public service. He left Washington on March 6 for a pre-arranged triumphal tour of the South, to end in Nashville. Polk had two years previously arranged to buy a house there, afterwards dubbed <a href="Polk%20Place">Polk Place</a>, that had once belonged to his old mentor, Felix Grundy.

James and Sarah Polk progressed down the Atlantic coast, and then westward through the <a href="Deep%20South">Deep South</a>. He was enthusiastically received and banqueted. By the time the Polks reached Alabama, he was suffering from a bad cold, and soon became concerned by reports of <a href="cholera">cholera</a>—a passenger on Polk's <a href="riverboat">riverboat</a> died of it, and it was rumored to be common in New Orleans, but it was too late to change plans. Worried about his health, he would have departed the city quickly, but was overwhelmed by Louisiana hospitality. Several passengers on the riverboat up the Mississippi died of the disease, and Polk felt so ill that he went ashore for four days, staying in a hotel. A doctor assured him he did not have cholera, and Polk made the final leg, arriving in Nashville on April 2 to a huge reception.

After a visit to James's mother in Columbia, the Polks settled into Polk Place. The exhausted former president seemed to gain new life, but in early June, he fell ill again, by most accounts of cholera. Attended by several doctors, he lingered for several days, and chose to be baptized into the Methodist Church, which he had long admired, though his mother arrived from Columbia with her Episcopalian clergyman, and his wife was also Episcopalian. By traditional accounts, his last words before he died on the afternoon of Friday June 15 were "I love you, Sarah, for all eternity, I love you"—Borneman noted that whether or not they were spoken, there was nothing in Polk's life which would make the sentiment false.

Polk's funeral was held at the McKendree Methodist Church in Nashville. Initially he was buried in what is now <a href="Nashville%20City%20Cemetery">Nashville City Cemetery</a>, due to a legal requirement related to his infectious disease death. He was moved to a tomb on the grounds of Polk Place (as specified in his will) less than a year later. Sarah Polk lived at Polk Place for 42 years after his death and died on August 14, 1891.

In 1893, the bodies of James and Sarah Polk were relocated to their current resting place on the grounds of the <a href="Tennessee%20State%20Capitol">Tennessee State Capitol</a> in Nashville. Polk Place was demolished in 1901. In March 2017, the Tennessee Senate approved a resolution considered a "first step" toward relocating the Polks' remains to <a href="James%20K.%20Polk%20Ancestral%20Home">the family home</a> in Columbia; as well as support by state lawmakers, the move requires approval by the courts and the <a href="Tennessee%20Historical%20Commission">Tennessee Historical Commission</a>.

Polk was a slaveholder for most of his adult life. His father, Samuel Polk, in 1827 left Polk more than 8,000 acres (32 km²) of land, and divided about 53 slaves among his widow and children in his will. James inherited twenty of his father's slaves, either directly or from deceased brothers. In 1831, he became an absentee cotton planter, sending slaves to clear <a href="Plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South">plantation</a> land that his father had left him near <a href="Somerville%2C%20Tennessee">Somerville, Tennessee</a>. Four years later Polk sold his Somerville plantation and, together with his brother-in-law, bought 920 acres (3.7 km²) of land, a cotton plantation near <a href="Coffeeville%2C%20Mississippi">Coffeeville, Mississippi</a>, hoping to increase his income. The land in Mississippi was richer than that in Somerville, and Polk transferred his Tennessee slaves there, taking care to conceal from them that they were to be sent south. From the start of 1839, Polk, having bought out his brother-in-law, owned all of the Mississippi plantation, and ran it on a mostly absentee basis for the rest of his life. He occasionally visited—for example, he spent much of April 1844 on his Mississippi plantation, right before the Democratic convention.

Adding to the inherited slaves, in 1831, Polk purchased five more, mostly buying them in Kentucky, and expending $1,870; the youngest had a recorded age of 11. As older children sold for a higher price, slave sellers routinely lied about age. Between 1834 and 1835, he bought five more, aged from 2 to 37, the youngest a granddaughter of the oldest. The amount expended was $2,250. In 1839, he bought eight slaves from his brother William at a cost of $5,600. This represented three young adults and most of a family, though not including the father, whom James Polk had previously owned, and who had been sold to a slave trader as a chronic runaway.

The expenses of four campaigns (three for governor, one for the presidency) in six years kept Polk from making more slave purchases until after he was living in the White House. In an era when the presidential salary was expected to cover wages for the White House servants, Polk replaced them with slaves from his home in Tennessee. Polk did not purchase slaves with his presidential salary, likely for political reasons. Instead, he reinvested earnings from his plantation in the purchase of slaves, enjoining secrecy on his agent: "that as my "private business" does not concern the public, you will keep it to yourself".

Polk saw the plantation as his route to a comfortable existence after his presidency for himself and his wife; he did not intend to return to the practice of law. Hoping the increased labor force would increase his retirement income, he purchased seven slaves in 1846, through an agent, aged roughly between 12 and 17. The 17 year old and one of the 12 year olds were purchased together at an <a href="estate%20sale">estate sale</a>; the agent within weeks resold the younger boy to Polk's profit. The year 1847 saw the purchase of nine more. Three he purchased from Gideon Pillow, and his agent purchased six slaves, aged between 10 and 20. By the time of the purchase from Pillow, the Mexican War had begun and Polk sent payment with the letter in which he offered Pillow a commission in the Army. The purchase from Pillow was a slave Polk had previously owned and had sold for being a disruption, and his wife and child. None of the other slaves Polk purchased as President, all younger than 20, came with a parent, and as only in the one case were two slaves bought together, most likely none had an accompanying sibling as each faced life on Polk's plantation.

Discipline for those owned by Polk varied over time. At the Tennessee plantation, he employed an <a href="Plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South%23Overseer">overseer</a> named Herbert Biles, who was said to be relatively indulgent. Biles's illness in 1833 resulted in Polk replacing him with Ephraim Beanland, who tightened discipline and increased work. Polk backed his overseer, returning runaways who complained of beatings and other harsh treatment, "even though every report suggested that the overseer was a heartless brute". Beanland was hired for the Mississippi plantation, but was soon dismissed by Polk's partner, who deemed Beanland too harsh as the slaves undertook the arduous task of clearing the timber from the new plantation so it could be used for cotton farming. His replacement was discharged after a year for being too indulgent; the next died of dysentery in 1839. Others followed, and it was not until 1845 that Polk found a satisfactory overseer, John Mairs, who remained the rest of Polk's life and was still working at the plantation for Sarah Polk in 1860, when the widow sold a half-share in many of her slaves. There had been a constant stream of runaways under Mairs' predecessors, many seeking protection at the plantation of Polk relatives or friends; only one ran away between the time of Mairs' hiring and the end of 1847, but the overseer had to report three absconded slaves (including the one who had fled earlier) to Polk in 1848 and 1849.

Polk's will, dated February 28, 1849, a few days before the end of his presidency, contained the nonbinding expectation that his slaves were to be freed when both he and Sarah Polk were dead. The Mississippi plantation was expected to be the support of Sarah Polk during her widowhood. Sarah Polk lived until 1891, but the slaves were freed in 1865 by the <a href="Thirteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Thirteenth Amendment</a>, which abolished slavery in the United States. By selling a half-interest in the slaves in 1860, Sarah Polk had given up the sole power to free them, and it is unlikely that her new partner, having paid $28,500 for a half-interest in the plantation and its slaves, would have allowed the laborers to go free had she died while slavery was legal.

Like Jackson, Polk saw the politics of slavery as a side issue compared to more important matters such as territorial expansion and economic policy. The issue of slavery became increasingly polarizing during the 1840s, and Polk's expansionary policies increased its divisiveness. During his presidency, many abolitionists harshly criticized him as an instrument of the "<a href="Slave%20Power">Slave Power</a>", and claimed that spreading slavery was the reason he supported <a href="Texas%20Annexation">annexing Texas</a> and later <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">war with Mexico</a>. Polk did support the expansion of slavery's realm, with his views informed by his own family's experience of settling Tennessee, bringing slaves with them. He believed in Southern rights, meaning both the right of slave states not to have that institution interfered with by the Federal government, and the right of individual Southerners to bring their slaves with them into the new territory. Though Polk opposed the Wilmot Proviso, he also condemned southern agitation on the issue, and he accused both northern and southern leaders of attempting to use the slavery issue for political gain.

On March 4, 2017, new tombstones for three of his slaves, Elias Polk, Mary Polk and Matilda Polk, were placed in the <a href="Nashville%20City%20Cemetery">Nashville City Cemetery</a>. Elias and Mary Polk both survived slavery, dying in the 1880s; Matilda Polk died still in slavery in 1849, at the age of about 110.

After his death, Polk's historic reputation was initially formed by the attacks made on him in his own time. Whig politicians claimed that he was drawn from a well-deserved obscurity. <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a> is said to have observed that Polk, a teetotaler, was "a victim of the use of water as a beverage". Little was published about him but two biographies released in the wake of his death. Polk was not again the subject of a major biography until 1922, when Eugene I. McCormac published "James K. Polk: A Political Biography". McCormac relied heavily on Polk's presidential diary, first published in 1909. When historians began ranking the presidents in 1948, Polk ranked 10th in <a href="Arthur%20M.%20Schlesinger%20Sr.">Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr.</a>'s poll, and has subsequently ranked 8th in Schlesinger's 1962 poll, 11th in the Riders-McIver Poll (1996), and 14th in the 2017 survey by <a href="C-SPAN">C-SPAN</a>.

Borneman deemed Polk the most effective president prior to the Civil War, and noted that Polk expanded the power of the presidency, especially in its power as commander in chief and its oversight over the Executive Branch. <a href="Steven%20G.%20Calabresi">Steven G. Calabresi</a> and <a href="Christopher%20S.%20Yoo">Christopher S. Yoo</a>, in their history of presidential power, praised Polk's conduct of the Mexican War, "it seems unquestionable that his management of state affairs during this conflict was one of the strongest examples since Jackson of the use of presidential power to direct specifically the conduct of subordinate officers."

<a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> called Polk "a great president. Said what he intended to do and did it." Bergeron noted that the matters that Polk settled, he settled for his time. The questions of the banking system, and of the tariff, which Polk had made two of the main issues of his presidency, were not significantly revised until the 1860s. Similarly, the Gadsden Purchase, and <a href="Alaska%20Purchase">that of Alaska</a> (1867), were the only major U.S. expansions until the 1890s.

Paul H. Bergeron wrote in his study of Polk's presidency: "Virtually everyone remembers Polk and his expansionist successes. He produced a new map of the United States, which fulfilled a continent-wide vision." "To look at that map," <a href="Robert%20W.%20Merry">Robert W. Merry</a> concluded, "and to take in the western and southwestern expanse included in it, is to see the magnitude of Polk's presidential accomplishments." <a href="Amy%20Greenberg">Amy Greenberg</a>, in her history of the Mexican War, found Polk's legacy to be more than territorial, "during a single brilliant term, he accomplished a feat that earlier presidents would have considered impossible. With the help of his wife, Sarah, he masterminded, provoked and successfully prosecuted a war that turned the United States into a world power." Borneman noted that in securing this expansion, Polk did not consider the likely effect on Mexicans and Native Americans, "That ignorance may well be debated on moral grounds, but it cannot take away Polk's stunning political achievement." <a href="James%20A.%20Rawley">James A. Rawley</a> wrote in his "<a href="American%20National%20Biography">American National Biography</a>" piece on Polk, "he added extensive territory to the United States, including Upper California and its valuable ports, and bequeathed a legacy of a nation poised on the Pacific rim prepared to emerge as a superpower in future generations".

Historians have criticized Polk for not perceiving that his territorial gains set the table for civil war. Pletcher stated that Polk, like others of his time, failed "to understand that sectionalism and expansion had formed a new, explosive compound". Fred I. Greenstein, in his journal article on Polk, noted that Polk "lacked a far-seeing awareness of the problems that were bound to arise over the status of slavery in the territory acquired from Mexico" William Dusinberre, in his volume on Polk as slave owner, suggested "that Polk's deep personal involvement in the plantation slavery system ... colored his stance on slavery-related issues".

Greenberg noted that Polk's war served as the training ground for that later conflict:

Jimi Hendrix

James Marshall "Jimi" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) was an American rock guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> describes him as "arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music".

Born in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and trained as a <a href="paratrooper">paratrooper</a> in the <a href="101st%20Airborne%20Division">101st Airborne Division</a>; he was granted an honorable discharge the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to <a href="Clarksville%2C%20Tennessee">Clarksville, Tennessee</a>, and began playing gigs on the <a href="Chitlin%27%20Circuit">Chitlin' Circuit</a>, earning a place in <a href="the%20Isley%20Brothers">the Isley Brothers</a>' backing band and later with <a href="Little%20Richard">Little Richard</a>, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. He then played with <a href="Curtis%20Knight">Curtis Knight</a> and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after being discovered by <a href="Linda%20Keith%20%28model%29">Linda Keith</a>, who in turn interested bassist <a href="Chas%20Chandler">Chas Chandler</a> of <a href="the%20Animals">the Animals</a> in becoming his first manager. Within months, Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with <a href="the%20Jimi%20Hendrix%20Experience">the Jimi Hendrix Experience</a>: "<a href="Hey%20Joe">Hey Joe</a>", "<a href="Purple%20Haze">Purple Haze</a>", and "<a href="The%20Wind%20Cries%20Mary">The Wind Cries Mary</a>". He achieved fame in the U.S. after his performance at the <a href="Monterey%20Pop%20Festival">Monterey Pop Festival</a> in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album, "<a href="Electric%20Ladyland">Electric Ladyland</a>", reached number one in the U.S.; it was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his first and only number one album. The world's highest-paid performer, he headlined the <a href="Woodstock">Woodstock</a> Festival in 1969 and the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight%20Festival%201970">Isle of Wight Festival</a> in 1970, before <a href="Death%20of%20Jimi%20Hendrix">his accidental death</a> from <a href="barbiturate">barbiturate</a>-related <a href="asphyxia">asphyxia</a> on September 18, 1970, at the age of 27.

Hendrix was inspired musically by American <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> and <a href="electric%20blues">electric blues</a>. He favored <a href="Distortion%20%28music%29">overdriven</a> amplifiers with high volume and <a href="Gain%20%28electronics%29">gain</a>, and was instrumental in popularizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by <a href="Guitar%20feedback">guitar amplifier feedback</a>. He was also one of the first guitarists to make extensive use of tone-altering <a href="effects%20units">effects units</a>, such as fuzz tone, <a href="Octavia%20%28effects%20pedal%29">Octavia</a>, <a href="wah-wah%20pedal">wah-wah</a>, and <a href="Uni-Vibe">Uni-Vibe</a> in mainstream rock. He was the first artist to use <a href="stereophonic%20sound">stereophonic</a> <a href="Phaser%20%28effect%29">phasing</a> effects in music recordings. Holly George-Warren of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" commented: "Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began."

Hendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1967, readers of "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" voted him the Pop Musician of the Year, and in 1968, "Rolling Stone" declared him the Performer of the Year. "<a href="Disc%20%28magazine%29">Disc and Music Echo</a>" honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970, "Guitar Player" named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the <a href="UK%20Music%20Hall%20of%20Fame">UK Music Hall of Fame</a> in 2005. "Rolling Stone" ranked the band's three studio albums, "<a href="Are%20You%20Experienced">Are You Experienced</a>", "", and "<a href="Electric%20Ladyland">Electric Ladyland</a>", among the <a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">100 greatest albums of all time</a>, and they ranked Hendrix as the greatest guitarist and the sixth greatest artist of all time.

Jimi Hendrix had a diverse heritage. His paternal grandmother, Zenora "Nora" Rose Moore, was African American and one-quarter <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a>. Hendrix's paternal grandfather, Bertran Philander Ross Hendrix (born 1866), was born out of an extramarital affair between a woman named Fanny, and a grain merchant from Urbana, Ohio, or Illinois, one of the wealthiest men in the area at that time. After Hendrix and Moore relocated to <a href="Vancouver%2C%20British%20Columbia">Vancouver, British Columbia</a>, Canada, had a son they named James Allen Hendrix on June 10, 1919; the family called him "Al".

In 1941 after moving to <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, Al met Lucille Jeter (1925–1958) at a dance; they married on March 31, 1942. Lucille's father (Jimi's maternal grandfather) was Preston Jeter (born 1875), whose mother was born in similar circumstances as Bertran Philander Ross Hendrix. Lucille's mother, née Clarice Lawson, had African American and Cherokee ancestors. Al, who had been drafted by the U.S. Army to serve in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, left to begin his basic training three days after the wedding. Johnny Allen Hendrix was born on November 27, 1942, in Seattle; he was the first of Lucille's five children. In 1946, Johnny's parents changed his name to James Marshall Hendrix, in honor of Al and his late brother Leon Marshall.

Stationed in Alabama at the time of Hendrix's birth, Al was denied the standard military furlough afforded servicemen for childbirth; his commanding officer placed him in the stockade to prevent him from going <a href="AWOL">AWOL</a> to see his infant son in Seattle. He spent two months locked up without trial, and while in the stockade received a telegram announcing his son's birth. During Al's three-year absence, Lucille struggled to raise their son. When Al was away, Hendrix was mostly cared for by family members and friends, especially Lucille's sister Delores Hall and her friend Dorothy Harding. Al received an honorable discharge from the U.S. Army on September 1, 1945. Two months later, unable to find Lucille, Al went to the <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley, California</a>, home of a family friend named Mrs. Champ, who had taken care of and had attempted to adopt Hendrix; this is where Al saw his son for the first time.

After returning from service, Al reunited with Lucille, but his inability to find steady work left the family impoverished. They both struggled with alcohol, and often fought when intoxicated. The violence sometimes drove Hendrix to withdraw and hide in a closet in their home. His relationship with his brother <a href="Leon%20Hendrix">Leon</a> (born 1948) was close but precarious; with Leon in and out of foster care, they lived with an almost constant threat of fraternal separation. In addition to Leon, Hendrix had three younger siblings: Joseph, born in 1949, Kathy in 1950, and Pamela, 1951, all of whom Al and Lucille gave up to foster care and adoption. The family frequently moved, staying in cheap hotels and apartments around Seattle. On occasion, family members would take Hendrix to <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> to stay at his grandmother's. A shy and sensitive boy, he was deeply affected by his life experiences. In later years, he confided to a girlfriend that he had been the victim of sexual abuse by a man in uniform. On December 17, 1951, when Hendrix was nine years old, his parents divorced; the court granted Al custody of him and Leon.

At Horace Mann Elementary School in Seattle during the mid-1950s, Hendrix's habit of carrying a broom with him to emulate a guitar gained the attention of the school's social worker. After more than a year of his clinging to a broom like a <a href="Comfort%20object">security blanket</a>, she wrote a letter requesting school funding intended for underprivileged children, insisting that leaving him without a guitar might result in psychological damage. Her efforts failed, and Al refused to buy him a guitar.

In 1957, while helping his father with a side-job, Hendrix found a <a href="ukulele">ukulele</a> amongst the garbage they were removing from an older woman's home. She told him that he could keep the instrument, which had only one string. Learning by ear, he played single notes, following along to <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a> songs, particularly "<a href="Hound%20Dog%20%28song%29">Hound Dog</a>". By the age of 33, Hendrix's mother Lucille had developed <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a> of the liver, and on February 2, 1958, she died when her <a href="spleen">spleen</a> ruptured. Al refused to take James and Leon to attend their mother's funeral; he instead gave them shots of whiskey and instructed them that was how men should deal with loss. In 1958, Hendrix completed his studies at <a href="Washington%20Middle%20School%20%28Seattle%2C%20Washington%29">Washington Junior High School</a> and began attending, but did not graduate from, <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield%20High%20School%20%28Seattle%29">Garfield High School</a>.

In mid-1958, at age 15, Hendrix acquired his first acoustic guitar, for $5 (equivalent to $43.40 in 2018). He played for hours daily, watching others and learning from more experienced guitarists, and listening to <a href="blues">blues</a> artists such as <a href="Muddy%20Waters">Muddy Waters</a>, <a href="B.B.%20King">B.B. King</a>, <a href="Howlin%27%20Wolf">Howlin' Wolf</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Johnson">Robert Johnson</a>. The first tune Hendrix learned to play was the television theme "<a href="Peter%20Gunn%20%28song%29">Peter Gunn</a>". Around that time, Hendrix jammed with boyhood friend <a href="Sammy%20Drain">Sammy Drain</a> and his keyboard-playing brother. In 1959, attending a concert by <a href="Hank%20Ballard%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Midnighters">Hank Ballard & the Midnighters</a> in Seattle, Hendrix met the group's guitarist <a href="Billy%20Davis%20%28guitarist%29">Billy Davis</a>. Davis showed him some guitar licks and later got him a short gig with the Midnighters. The two remained friends until Hendrix's death in 1970.

Soon after he acquired the acoustic guitar, Hendrix formed his first band, the Velvetones. Without an electric guitar, he could barely be heard over the sound of the group. After about three months, he realized that he needed an electric guitar. In mid-1959, his father relented and bought him a white <a href="Supro%20Ozark%201560%20S">Supro Ozark</a>. Hendrix's first gig was with an unnamed band in the Jaffe Room of Seattle's <a href="Temple%20De%20Hirsch%20Sinai">Temple De Hirsch Sinai</a>, but they fired him between sets for showing off. He joined the Rocking Kings, which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club. When his guitar was stolen after he left it backstage overnight, Al bought him a red <a href="Silvertone%20%28instruments%29">Silvertone</a> <a href="Danelectro">Danelectro</a>.

Before Hendrix was 19 years old, law authorities had twice caught him <a href="Joyride%20%28crime%29">riding in stolen cars</a>. Given a choice between prison or joining the <a href="United%20States%20Army">Army</a>, he chose the latter and enlisted on May 31, 1961. After completing eight weeks of <a href="Recruit%20training">basic training</a> at <a href="Fort%20Ord">Fort Ord</a>, California, he was assigned to the <a href="101st%20Airborne%20Division">101st Airborne Division</a> and stationed at <a href="Fort%20Campbell">Fort Campbell</a>, <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. He arrived on November 8, and soon afterward he wrote to his father: "There's nothing but physical training and harassment here for two weeks, then when you go to jump school ... you get hell. They work you to death, fussing and fighting." In his next letter home, Hendrix, who had left his guitar at his girlfriend Betty Jean Morgan's house in Seattle, asked his father to send it to him as soon as possible, stating: "I really need it now." His father obliged and sent the red Silvertone Danelectro on which Hendrix had hand-painted the words "Betty Jean" to Fort Campbell. His apparent obsession with the instrument contributed to his neglect of his duties, which led to taunting and physical abuse from his peers, who at least once hid the guitar from him until he had begged for its return.

In November 1961, fellow serviceman <a href="Billy%20Cox">Billy Cox</a> walked past an army club and heard Hendrix playing. Impressed by Hendrix's technique, which Cox described as a combination of "<a href="John%20Lee%20Hooker">John Lee Hooker</a> and <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>", Cox borrowed a bass guitar and the two <a href="Jam%20session">jammed</a>. Within weeks, they began performing at base clubs on the weekends with other musicians in a loosely organized band, the Casuals.

Hendrix completed his <a href="paratrooper">paratrooper</a> training in just over eight months, and Major General C. W. G. Rich awarded him the prestigious Screaming Eagles patch on January 11, 1962. By February, his personal conduct had begun to draw criticism from his superiors. They labeled him an unqualified marksman and often caught him napping while on duty and failing to report for bed checks. On May 24, Hendrix's platoon sergeant, James C. Spears, filed a report in which he stated: "He has no interest whatsoever in the Army ... It is my opinion that Private Hendrix will never come up to the standards required of a soldier. I feel that the military service will benefit if he is discharged as soon as possible." On June 29, 1962, Captain Gilbert Batchman granted Hendrix an honorable discharge on the basis of unsuitability. Hendrix later spoke of his dislike of the army and lied that he had received a medical discharge after breaking his ankle during his 26th parachute jump.

In September 1963, after Cox was discharged from the Army, he and Hendrix moved to <a href="Clarksville%2C%20Tennessee">Clarksville, Tennessee</a>, and formed a band called the King Kasuals. Hendrix had watched Butch Snipes play with his teeth in Seattle and by now Alphonso 'Baby Boo' Young, the other guitarist in the band, was performing this guitar gimmick. Not to be upstaged, Hendrix learned to play with his teeth. He later commented: "The idea of doing that came to me...in Tennessee. Down there you have to play with your teeth or else you get shot. There's a trail of broken teeth all over the stage." Although they began playing low-paying gigs at obscure venues, the band eventually moved to <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a>'s Jefferson Street, which was the traditional heart of the city's black community and home to a thriving <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">rhythm and blues</a> music scene. They earned a brief residency playing at a popular venue in town, the Club del Morocco, and for the next two years Hendrix made a living performing at a circuit of venues throughout the South that were affiliated with the <a href="Theater%20Owners%27%20Booking%20Association">Theater Owners' Booking Association</a> (TOBA), widely known as the <a href="Chitlin%27%20Circuit">Chitlin' Circuit</a>. In addition to playing in his own band, Hendrix performed as a backing musician for various soul, R&B, and blues musicians, including <a href="Wilson%20Pickett">Wilson Pickett</a>, <a href="Slim%20Harpo">Slim Harpo</a>, <a href="Sam%20Cooke">Sam Cooke</a>, <a href="Ike%20%26amp%3B%20Tina%20Turner">Ike & Tina Turner</a> and <a href="Jackie%20Wilson">Jackie Wilson</a>.

In January 1964, feeling he had outgrown the circuit artistically, and frustrated by having to follow the rules of bandleaders, Hendrix decided to venture out on his own. He moved into the <a href="Hotel%20Theresa">Hotel Theresa</a> in <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a>, where he befriended Lithofayne Pridgon, known as "Faye", who became his girlfriend. A Harlem native with connections throughout the area's music scene, Pridgon provided him with shelter, support, and encouragement. Hendrix also met the <a href="TaharQa%20and%20Tunde%20Ra%20Aleem">Allen twins, Arthur and Albert</a>. In February 1964, Hendrix won first prize in the <a href="Apollo%20Theater">Apollo Theater</a> amateur contest. Hoping to secure a career opportunity, he played the Harlem club circuit and sat in with various bands. At the recommendation of a former associate of <a href="Joe%20Tex">Joe Tex</a>, <a href="Ronald%20Isley">Ronnie Isley</a> granted Hendrix an audition that led to an offer to become the guitarist with <a href="the%20Isley%20Brothers">the Isley Brothers</a>' back-up band, the I.B. Specials, which he readily accepted.

In March 1964, Hendrix recorded the two-part single "<a href="Testify%20%28The%20Isley%20Brothers%20song%29">Testify</a>" with the Isley Brothers. Released in June, it failed to chart. In May, he provided guitar instrumentation for the <a href="Don%20Covay">Don Covay</a> song, "<a href="Mercy%20Mercy">Mercy Mercy</a>". Issued in August by Rosemart Records and distributed by <a href="Atlantic%20Records">Atlantic</a>, the track reached number 35 on the <a href="Billboard%20charts">"Billboard" chart</a>.

Hendrix toured with the Isleys during much of 1964, but near the end of October, after growing tired of playing the same set every night, he left the band. Soon afterward, Hendrix joined <a href="Little%20Richard">Little Richard</a>'s touring band, the Upsetters. During a stop in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> in February 1965, he recorded his first and only single with Richard, "I Don't Know What You Got (But It's Got Me)", written by Don Covay and released by Vee-Jay Records. Richard's popularity was waning at the time, and the single peaked at number 92, where it remained for one week before dropping off the chart. Hendrix met singer Rosa Lee Brooks while staying at the Wilcox Hotel in Hollywood, and she invited him to participate in a recording session for her single, which included the <a href="Arthur%20Lee%20%28musician%29">Arthur Lee</a> penned "My Diary" as the <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">A-side</a>, and "Utee" as the B-side. Hendrix played guitar on both tracks, which also included background vocals by Lee. The single failed to chart, but Hendrix and Lee began a friendship that lasted several years; Hendrix later became an ardent supporter of Lee's band, <a href="Love%20%28band%29">Love</a>.

In July 1965, on Nashville's Channel 5 "Night Train", Hendrix made his first television appearance. Performing in Little Richard's ensemble band, he backed up vocalists Buddy and Stacy on "Shotgun". The video recording of the show marks the earliest known footage of Hendrix performing. Richard and Hendrix often clashed over tardiness, wardrobe, and Hendrix's stage antics, and in late July, Richard's brother Robert fired him. He then briefly rejoined the Isley Brothers, and recorded a second single with them, "Move Over and Let Me Dance" backed with "Have You Ever Been Disappointed". Later that year, he joined a New York-based R&B band, <a href="Curtis%20Knight">Curtis Knight</a> and the Squires, after meeting Knight in the lobby of a hotel where both men were staying. Hendrix performed with them for eight months. In October 1965, he and Knight recorded the single, "How Would You Feel" backed with "Welcome Home" and on October 15, Hendrix signed a three-year recording contract with entrepreneur <a href="Ed%20Chalpin">Ed Chalpin</a>. While the relationship with Chalpin was short-lived, his contract remained in force, which later caused legal and career problems for Hendrix. During his time with Knight, Hendrix briefly toured with <a href="Joey%20Dee%20and%20the%20Starliters">Joey Dee and the Starliters</a>, and worked with <a href="King%20Curtis">King Curtis</a> on several recordings including <a href="Ray%20Sharpe">Ray Sharpe</a>'s two-part single, "Help Me". Hendrix earned his first composer credits for two instrumentals, "Hornets Nest" and "Knock Yourself Out", released as a <a href="Curtis%20Knight%20and%20the%20Squires">Curtis Knight and the Squires</a> single in 1966.

Feeling restricted by his experiences as an R&B sideman, Hendrix moved in 1966 to New York City's <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>, which had a vibrant and diverse music scene. There, he was offered a residency at the <a href="Cafe%20Wha%3F">Cafe Wha?</a> on MacDougal Street and formed his own band that June, <a href="Jimmy%20James%20and%20the%20Blue%20Flames">Jimmy James and the Blue Flames</a>, which included future <a href="Spirit%20%28band%29">Spirit</a> guitarist <a href="Randy%20California">Randy California</a>. The Blue Flames played at several clubs in New York and Hendrix began developing his guitar style and material that he would soon use with the Experience. In September, they gave some of their last concerts at the <a href="Cafe%20au%20Go%20Go">Cafe au Go Go</a>, as <a href="John%20Hammond%20Jr.">John Hammond Jr.</a>'s backing group.

By May 1966, Hendrix was struggling to earn a living wage playing the R&B circuit, so he briefly rejoined Curtis Knight and the Squires for an engagement at one of New York City's most popular nightspots, the Cheetah Club. During a performance, Linda Keith, the girlfriend of <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">Rolling Stones</a> guitarist <a href="Keith%20Richards">Keith Richards</a>, noticed Hendrix. She remembered: "[His] playing mesmerised me". She invited him to join her for a drink; he accepted and the two became friends.

While Hendrix was playing with Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, Keith recommended him to Stones manager <a href="Andrew%20Loog%20Oldham">Andrew Loog Oldham</a> and producer <a href="Seymour%20Stein">Seymour Stein</a>. They failed to see Hendrix's musical potential, and rejected him. She then referred him to <a href="Chas%20Chandler">Chas Chandler</a>, who was leaving <a href="the%20Animals">the Animals</a> and interested in managing and producing artists. Chandler saw the then-unknown Jimi Hendrix play in <a href="Cafe%20Wha%3F">Cafe Wha?</a>, a <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>, New York City nightclub. Chandler liked the <a href="Billy%20Roberts">Billy Roberts</a> song "<a href="Hey%20Joe">Hey Joe</a>", and was convinced he could create a hit single with the right artist. Impressed with Hendrix's version of the song, he brought him to London on September 24, 1966, and signed him to a management and production contract with himself and ex-Animals manager <a href="Michael%20Jeffery%20%28manager%29">Michael Jeffery</a>. On September 24, Hendrix gave an impromptu solo performance at <a href="The%20Scotch%20of%20St%20James">The Scotch of St James</a>, and later that night he began a relationship with <a href="Kathy%20Etchingham">Kathy Etchingham</a> that lasted for two and a half years.
Following Hendrix's arrival in London, Chandler began recruiting members for a band designed to highlight the guitarist's talents, <a href="the%20Jimi%20Hendrix%20Experience">the Jimi Hendrix Experience</a>. Hendrix met guitarist <a href="Noel%20Redding">Noel Redding</a> at an audition for the New Animals, where Redding's knowledge of blues progressions impressed Hendrix, who stated that he also liked Redding's hairstyle. Chandler asked Redding if he wanted to play bass guitar in Hendrix's band; Redding agreed. Chandler then began looking for a drummer and soon after, he contacted <a href="Mitch%20Mitchell">Mitch Mitchell</a> through a mutual friend. Mitchell, who had recently been fired from <a href="Georgie%20Fame%20and%20the%20Blue%20Flames">Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames</a>, participated in a rehearsal with Redding and Hendrix where they found common ground in their shared interest in rhythm and blues. When Chandler phoned Mitchell later that day to offer him the position, he readily accepted. Chandler also convinced Hendrix to change the spelling of his first name from "Jimmy" to the exotic looking "Jimi".

On October 1, 1966, Chandler brought Hendrix to the <a href="University%20of%20Westminster">London Polytechnic</a> at Regent Street, where <a href="Cream%20%28band%29">Cream</a> was scheduled to perform, and where Hendrix and <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a> met. Clapton later commented: "He asked if he could play a couple of numbers. I said, 'Of course', but I had a funny feeling about him." Halfway through Cream's set, Hendrix took the stage and performed a frantic version of the Howlin' Wolf song "<a href="Killing%20Floor%20%28Howlin%27%20Wolf%20song%29">Killing Floor</a>". In 1989, Clapton described the performance: "He played just about every style you could think of, and not in a flashy way. I mean he did a few of his tricks, like playing with his teeth and behind his back, but it wasn't in an upstaging sense at all, and that was it ... He walked off, and my life was never the same again".

In mid-October 1966, Chandler arranged an engagement for the Experience as <a href="Johnny%20Hallyday">Johnny Hallyday</a>'s supporting act during a brief tour of France. Thus, the Jimi Hendrix Experience performed their very first show on October 13, 1966, at the Novelty in <a href="Evreux">Evreux</a>. Their enthusiastically received 15-minute performance at the <a href="Olympia%20%28Paris%29">Olympia</a> theatre in Paris on October 18 marks the earliest known recording of the band. In late October, <a href="Kit%20Lambert">Kit Lambert</a> and <a href="Chris%20Stamp">Chris Stamp</a>, managers of <a href="the%20Who">the Who</a>, signed the Experience to their newly formed label, <a href="Track%20Records">Track Records</a>, and the group recorded their first song, "Hey Joe", on October 23. "<a href="Stone%20Free">Stone Free</a>", which was Hendrix's first songwriting effort after arriving in England, was recorded on November 2.

In mid-November, they performed at <a href="the%20Bag%20O%27Nails">the Bag O'Nails</a> nightclub in London, with Clapton, <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a>, <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Beck">Jeff Beck</a>, <a href="Pete%20Townshend">Pete Townshend</a>, <a href="Brian%20Jones">Brian Jones</a>, <a href="Mick%20Jagger">Mick Jagger</a>, and <a href="Kevin%20Ayers">Kevin Ayers</a> in attendance. Ayers described the crowd's reaction as stunned disbelief: "All the stars were there, and I heard serious comments, you know 'shit', 'Jesus', 'damn' and other words worse than that." The successful performance earned Hendrix his first interview, published in "<a href="Record%20Mirror">Record Mirror</a>" with the headline: "Mr. Phenomenon". "Now hear this ... we predict that [Hendrix] is going to whirl around the business like a tornado", wrote <a href="Bill%20Harry">Bill Harry</a>, who asked the rhetorical question: "Is that full, big, swinging sound really being created by only three people?" Hendrix commented: "We don't want to be classed in any category ... If it must have a tag, I'd like it to be called, 'Free Feeling'. It's a mixture of rock, freak-out, rave and blues". Through a distribution deal with <a href="Polydor%20Records">Polydor Records</a>, the Experience's first single, "Hey Joe", backed with "Stone Free", was released on December 16, 1966. After appearances on the UK television shows "<a href="Ready%20Steady%20Go%21">Ready Steady Go!</a>" and the "<a href="Top%20of%20the%20Pops">Top of the Pops</a>", "Hey Joe" entered the UK charts on December 29 and peaked at number six. Further success came in March 1967 with the UK number three hit "<a href="Purple%20Haze">Purple Haze</a>", and in May with "<a href="The%20Wind%20Cries%20Mary">The Wind Cries Mary</a>", which remained on the UK charts for eleven weeks, peaking at number six. On March 12, 1967, he performed at the Troutbeck Hotel, Ilkley, West Yorkshire, where, after about 900 people turned up (the hotel was licensed for 250) the local police stopped the gig due to safety concerns.

On March 31, 1967, while the Experience waited to perform at the <a href="London%20Astoria">London Astoria</a>, Hendrix and Chandler discussed ways in which they could increase the band's media exposure. When Chandler asked journalist Keith Altham for advice, Altham suggested that they needed to do something more dramatic than the stage show of the Who, which involved the smashing of instruments. Hendrix joked: "Maybe I can smash up an elephant", to which Altham replied: "Well, it's a pity you can't set fire to your guitar". Chandler then asked road manager Gerry Stickells to procure some <a href="Naphtha">lighter fluid</a>. During the show, Hendrix gave an especially dynamic performance before setting his guitar on fire at the end of a 45-minute set. In the wake of the stunt, members of London's press labeled Hendrix the "Black Elvis" and the "Wild Man of Borneo".

After the UK chart success of their first two singles, "Hey Joe" and "Purple Haze", the Experience began assembling material for a full-length LP. Recording began at <a href="De%20Lane%20Lea%20Studios">De Lane Lea Studios</a> and later moved to the prestigious <a href="Olympic%20Studios">Olympic Studios</a>. The album, "<a href="Are%20You%20Experienced">Are You Experienced</a>", features a diversity of musical styles, including blues tracks such as "<a href="Red%20House%20%28song%29">Red House</a>" and "<a href="Highway%20Chile">Highway Chile</a>", and the R&B song "Remember". It also included the experimental science fiction piece, "<a href="Third%20Stone%20from%20the%20Sun">Third Stone from the Sun</a>" and the post-modern soundscapes of <a href="Are%20You%20Experienced%20%28song%29">the title track</a>, with prominent <a href="Backmasking">backwards</a> guitar and drums. "I Don't Live Today" served as a medium for Hendrix's <a href="guitar%20feedback">guitar feedback</a> improvisation and "<a href="Fire%20%28The%20Jimi%20Hendrix%20Experience%20song%29">Fire</a>" was driven by Mitchell's drumming.

Released in the UK on May 12, 1967, "Are You Experienced" spent 33 weeks on the charts, peaking at number two. It was prevented from reaching the top spot by the Beatles' "<a href="Sgt.%20Pepper%27s%20Lonely%20Hearts%20Club%20Band">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>". On June 4, 1967, Hendrix opened a show at the <a href="Saville%20Theatre">Saville Theatre</a> in London with his rendition of "Sgt. Pepper" <a href="Sgt.%20Pepper%27s%20Lonely%20Hearts%20Club%20Band%20%28song%29">title track</a>, which was released just three days previous. Beatles manager <a href="Brian%20Epstein">Brian Epstein</a> owned the Saville at the time, and both <a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a> and Paul McCartney attended the performance. McCartney described the moment: "The curtains flew back and he came walking forward playing 'Sgt. Pepper'. It's a pretty major compliment in anyone's book. I put that down as one of the great honors of my career." Released in the U.S. on August 23 by <a href="Reprise%20Records">Reprise Records</a>, "Are You Experienced" reached number five on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>.

In 1989, Noe Goldwasser, the founding editor of "<a href="Guitar%20World">Guitar World</a>" magazine, described "Are You Experienced" as "the album that shook the world ... leaving it forever changed". In 2005, "Rolling Stone" called the double-platinum LP Hendrix's "epochal debut", and they ranked it the 15th greatest album of all time, noting his "exploitation of amp howl", and characterizing his guitar playing as "incendiary ... historic in itself".

Although popular in Europe at the time, the Experience's first U.S. single, "Hey Joe", failed to reach the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> chart upon its release on May 1, 1967. The group's fortunes improved when McCartney recommended them to the organizers of the <a href="Monterey%20Pop%20Festival">Monterey Pop Festival</a>. He insisted that the event would be incomplete without Hendrix, whom he called "an absolute ace on the guitar", and he agreed to join the board of organizers on the condition that the Experience perform at the festival in mid-June.

Introduced by Brian Jones as "the most exciting performer [he had] ever heard", Hendrix opened with a fast arrangement of Howlin' Wolf's song "Killing Floor", wearing what author Keith Shadwick described as "clothes as exotic as any on display elsewhere." Shadwick wrote: "[Hendrix] was not only something utterly new musically, but an entirely original vision of what a black American entertainer should and could look like." The Experience went on to perform renditions of "Hey Joe", B.B. King's "Rock Me Baby", <a href="Chip%20Taylor">Chip Taylor</a>'s "<a href="Wild%20Thing%20%28The%20Troggs%20song%29">Wild Thing</a>", and <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>'s "<a href="Like%20a%20Rolling%20Stone">Like a Rolling Stone</a>", as well as four original compositions: "<a href="Foxy%20Lady">Foxy Lady</a>", "Can You See Me", "The Wind Cries Mary", and "Purple Haze". The set ended with Hendrix <a href="Instrument%20destruction">destroying</a> his guitar and tossing pieces of it out to the audience. "Rolling Stone" Alex Vadukul wrote:

Caraeff stood on a chair next to the edge of the stage while taking a series of four <a href="monochrome">monochrome</a> pictures of Hendrix burning his guitar. Caraeff was close enough to the fire that he had to use his camera as a shield to protect his face from the heat. "Rolling Stone" later colorized the image, matching it with other pictures taken at the festival before using the shot for a 1987 magazine cover. According to author Gail Buckland, the fourth and final frame of "Hendrix kneeling in front of his burning guitar, hands raised, is one of the most famous images in rock." Author and historian Matthew C. Whitaker wrote: "Hendrix's burning of his guitar became an iconic image in rock history and brought him national attention." The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" asserted that, upon leaving the stage, Hendrix "graduated from rumor to legend". Author John McDermott commented: "Hendrix left the Monterey audience stunned and in disbelief at what they'd just heard and seen." According to Hendrix: "I decided to destroy my guitar at the end of a song as a sacrifice. You sacrifice things you love. I love my guitar." The performance was filmed by <a href="D.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BA.%20Pennebaker">D. A. Pennebaker</a>, and later included in the concert documentary "<a href="Monterey%20Pop">Monterey Pop</a>", which helped Hendrix gain popularity with the U.S. public.

Immediately after the festival, the Experience were booked for a series of five concerts at <a href="Bill%20Graham%20%28promoter%29">Bill Graham's</a> <a href="The%20Fillmore">Fillmore</a>, with <a href="Big%20Brother%20and%20the%20Holding%20Company">Big Brother and the Holding Company</a> and <a href="Jefferson%20Airplane">Jefferson Airplane</a>. The Experience outperformed Jefferson Airplane during the first two nights, and replaced them at the top of the bill on the fifth. Following their successful West Coast introduction, which included a free open-air concert at <a href="Golden%20Gate%20Park">Golden Gate Park</a> and a concert at the <a href="Whisky%20a%20Go%20Go">Whisky a Go Go</a>, the Experience were booked as the opening act for the first American tour of <a href="the%20Monkees">the Monkees</a>. They requested Hendrix as a supporting act because they were fans, but their young audience disliked the Experience, who left the tour after six shows. Chandler later admitted that he engineered the tour in an effort to gain publicity for Hendrix.

The second Experience album, "", opens with the track "EXP", which utilized microphonic and harmonic <a href="Audio%20feedback">feedback</a> in a new, creative fashion. It also showcased an experimental stereo panning effect in which sounds emanating from Hendrix's guitar move through the stereo image, revolving around the listener. The piece reflected his growing interest in science fiction and <a href="outer%20space">outer space</a>. He composed the album's <a href="Bold%20as%20Love%20%28song%29">title track</a> and finale around two verses and two choruses, during which he pairs emotions with <a href="persona">persona</a>s, comparing them to colors. The song's <a href="coda%20%28music%29">coda</a> features the first recording of stereo <a href="Phaser%20%28effect%29">phasing</a>. Shadwick described the composition as "possibly the most ambitious piece on "Axis", the extravagant metaphors of the lyrics suggesting a growing confidence" in Hendrix's songwriting. His guitar playing throughout the song is marked by chordal <a href="arpeggio">arpeggio</a>s and <a href="contrapuntal%20motion">contrapuntal motion</a>, with <a href="tremolo">tremolo</a>-picked partial chords providing the musical foundation for the chorus, which culminates in what <a href="musicology">musicologist</a> Andy Aledort described as "simply one of the greatest electric guitar solos ever played". The track fades out on tremolo-picked <a href="thirty-second%20note">32nd note</a> <a href="double%20stop">double stop</a>s.

The scheduled release date for "Axis" was almost delayed when Hendrix lost the master tape of side one of the LP, leaving it in the back seat of a London taxi. With the deadline looming, Hendrix, Chandler, and engineer <a href="Eddie%20Kramer">Eddie Kramer</a> remixed most of side one in a single overnight session, but they could not match the quality of the lost mix of "<a href="If%206%20Was%209">If 6 Was 9</a>". Bassist Noel Redding had a tape recording of this mix, which had to be smoothed out with an iron as it had gotten wrinkled. During the verses, Hendrix doubled his singing with a guitar line which he played one octave lower than his vocals. Hendrix voiced his disappointment about having re-mixed the album so quickly, and he felt that it could have been better had they been given more time.

"Axis" featured psychedelic cover art that depicts Hendrix and the Experience as various <a href="Dashavatara">avatars</a> of <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>, incorporating a painting of them by Roger Law, from a photo-portrait by Karl Ferris. The painting was then superimposed on a copy of a mass-produced religious poster. Hendrix stated that the cover, which Track spent $5,000 producing, would have been more appropriate had it highlighted his American Indian heritage. He commented: "You got it wrong ... I'm not that kind of Indian." Track released the album in the UK on December 1, 1967, where it peaked at number five, spending 16 weeks on the charts. In February 1968, "Axis: Bold as Love" reached number three in the U.S.

While author and journalist <a href="Richie%20Unterberger">Richie Unterberger</a> described "Axis" as the least impressive Experience album, according to author Peter Doggett, the release "heralded a new subtlety in Hendrix's work". Mitchell commented: ""Axis" was the first time that it became apparent that Jimi was pretty good working behind the mixing board, as well as playing, and had some positive ideas of how he wanted things recorded. It could have been the start of any potential conflict between him and Chas in the studio."

Recording for the Experience's third and final studio album, "<a href="Electric%20Ladyland">Electric Ladyland</a>", began at the newly opened <a href="Record%20Plant%20Studios">Record Plant Studios</a>, with Chandler as producer and engineers Eddie Kramer and <a href="Gary%20Kellgren">Gary Kellgren</a>. As the sessions progressed, Chandler became increasingly frustrated with Hendrix's perfectionism and his demands for repeated takes. Hendrix also allowed numerous friends and guests to join them in the studio, which contributed to a chaotic and crowded environment in the control room and led Chandler to sever his professional relationship with Hendrix. Redding later recalled: "There were tons of people in the studio; you couldn't move. It was a party, not a session." Redding, who had formed his own band in mid-1968, <a href="Fat%20Mattress">Fat Mattress</a>, found it increasingly difficult to fulfill his commitments with the Experience, so Hendrix played many of the bass parts on "Electric Ladyland". The album's cover stated that it was "produced and directed by Jimi Hendrix".

During the "Electric Ladyland" recording sessions, Hendrix began experimenting with other combinations of musicians, including Jefferson Airplane's <a href="Jack%20Casady">Jack Casady</a> and <a href="Traffic%20%28band%29">Traffic's</a> <a href="Steve%20Winwood">Steve Winwood</a>, who played bass and organ, respectively, on the 15-minute slow-blues jam, "<a href="Voodoo%20Chile">Voodoo Chile</a>". During the album's production, Hendrix appeared at an impromptu jam with B.B. King, <a href="Al%20Kooper">Al Kooper</a>, and <a href="Elvin%20Bishop">Elvin Bishop</a>. "Electric Ladyland" was released on October 25, and by mid-November it had reached number one in the U.S., spending two weeks at the top spot. The <a href="Double%20album">double LP</a> was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his only number one album. It peaked at number six in the UK, spending 12 weeks on the chart. "Electric Ladyland" included Hendrix's cover of Bob Dylan's song, "<a href="All%20Along%20the%20Watchtower">All Along the Watchtower</a>", which became Hendrix's highest-selling single and his only U.S. top 40 hit, peaking at number 20; the single reached number five in the UK. "<a href="Burning%20of%20the%20Midnight%20Lamp">Burning of the Midnight Lamp</a>", which was his first recorded song to feature the use of a <a href="wah-wah%20pedal">wah-wah pedal</a>, was added to the album. It was originally released as his fourth single in the UK in August 1967 and reached number 18 in the charts.

In 1989, Noe Goldwasser, the founding editor of "Guitar World" magazine, described "Electric Ladyland" as "Hendrix's masterpiece". According to author Michael Heatley, "most critics agree" that the album is "the fullest realization of Jimi's far-reaching ambitions." In 2004, author Peter Doggett commented: "For pure experimental genius, melodic flair, conceptual vision and instrumental brilliance, "Electric Ladyland" remains a prime contender for the status of rock's greatest album." Doggett described the LP as "a display of musical virtuosity never surpassed by any rock musician."

In January 1969, after an absence of more than six months, Hendrix briefly moved back into his girlfriend Kathy Etchingham's Brook Street apartment, which was next door to the <a href="Handel%20House%20Museum">Handel House Museum</a> in the West End of London. During this time, the Experience toured Scandinavia, Germany, and gave their final two performances in France. On February 18 and 24, they played sold-out concerts at London's <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>, which were the last European appearances of this lineup.

By February 1969, Redding had grown weary of Hendrix's unpredictable work ethic and his creative control over the Experience's music. During the previous month's European tour, interpersonal relations within the group had deteriorated, particularly between Hendrix and Redding. In his diary, Redding documented the building frustration during early 1969 recording sessions: "On the first day, as I nearly expected, there was nothing doing ... On the second it was no show at all. I went to the pub for three hours, came back, and it was still ages before Jimi ambled in. Then we argued ... On the last day, I just watched it happen for a while, and then went back to my flat." The last Experience sessions that included Redding—a re-recording of "Stone Free" for use as a possible single release—took place on April 14 at Olmstead and the Record Plant in New York. Hendrix then flew bassist Billy Cox to New York; they started recording and rehearsing together on April 21.

The last performance of the original Experience lineup took place on June 29, 1969, at Barry Fey's <a href="Denver%20Pop%20Festival">Denver Pop Festival</a>, a three-day event held at <a href="Denver">Denver</a>'s <a href="Mile%20High%20Stadium">Mile High Stadium</a> that was marked by police using tear gas to control the audience. The band narrowly escaped from the venue in the back of a rental truck, which was partly crushed by fans who had climbed on top of the vehicle. Before the show, a journalist angered Redding by asking why he was there; the reporter then informed him that two weeks earlier Hendrix announced that he had been replaced with Billy Cox. The next day, Redding quit the Experience and returned to London. He announced that he had left the band and intended to pursue a solo career, blaming Hendrix's plans to expand the group without allowing for his input as a primary reason for leaving. Redding later commented: "Mitch and I hung out a lot together, but we're English. If we'd go out, Jimi would stay in his room. But any bad feelings came from us being three guys who were traveling too hard, getting too tired, and taking too many drugs ... I liked Hendrix. I don't like Mitchell."

Soon after Redding's departure, Hendrix began lodging at the eight-bedroom Ashokan House, in the hamlet of Boiceville near <a href="Woodstock">Woodstock</a> in upstate New York, where he had spent some time vacationing in mid-1969. Manager Michael Jeffery arranged the accommodations in the hope that the respite might encourage Hendrix to write material for a new album. During this time, Mitchell was unavailable for commitments made by Jeffery, which included Hendrix's first appearance on U.S. TV—on "<a href="The%20Dick%20Cavett%20Show">The Dick Cavett Show</a>"—where he was backed by the studio orchestra, and an appearance on "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show">The Tonight Show</a>" where he appeared with Cox and session drummer <a href="Ed%20Shaughnessy">Ed Shaughnessy</a>.

By 1969, Hendrix was the world's highest-paid rock musician. In August, he headlined the Woodstock Music and Art Fair that included many of the most popular bands of the time. For the concert, he added rhythm guitarist <a href="Larry%20Lee%20%28musician%29">Larry Lee</a> and conga players <a href="Juma%20Sultan">Juma Sultan</a> and <a href="Gerardo%20Velez">Jerry Velez</a>. The band rehearsed for less than two weeks before the performance, and according to Mitchell, they never connected musically. Before arriving at the engagement, Hendrix heard reports that the size of the audience had grown to epic proportions, which gave him cause for concern as he did not enjoy performing for large crowds. He was an important draw for the event, and although he accepted substantially less money for the appearance than his usual fee, he was the festival's highest-paid performer. As his scheduled time slot of midnight on Sunday drew closer, he indicated that he preferred to wait and close the show in the morning; the band took the stage around 8:00 a.m. on Monday. By the time of their set, Hendrix had been awake for more than three days. The audience, which peaked at an estimated 400,000 people, was now reduced to 30–40,000, many of whom had waited to catch a glimpse of Hendrix before leaving during his performance. The festival MC, <a href="Chip%20Monck">Chip Monck</a>, introduced the group as "the Jimi Hendrix Experience", but Hendrix clarified: "We decided to change the whole thing around and call it "Gypsy Sun and Rainbows". For short, it's nothin' but a "Band of Gypsys"".

Hendrix's performance featured a rendition of the U.S. national anthem, "<a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>", during which he used copious amounts of amplifier feedback, distortion, and sustain to replicate the sounds made by rockets and bombs. Although contemporary political pundits described his interpretation as a statement against the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, three weeks later Hendrix explained its meaning: "We're all Americans ... it was like 'Go America!'... We play it the way the air is in America today. The air is slightly static, see". Immortalized in the 1970 documentary film, "<a href="Woodstock%20%28film%29">Woodstock</a>", his guitar-driven version would become part of the sixties <a href="Zeitgeist">Zeitgeist</a>. Pop critic Al Aronowitz of the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" wrote: "It was the most electrifying moment of Woodstock, and it was probably the single greatest moment of the sixties." Images of the performance showing Hendrix wearing a blue-beaded white leather jacket with fringe, a red head-scarf, and blue jeans are widely regarded as iconic pictures that capture a defining moment of the era. He played "Hey Joe" during the encore, concluding the 3-day festival. Upon leaving the stage, he collapsed from exhaustion. In 2011, the editors of "Guitar World" placed his rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" at Woodstock at number one in their list of his 100 greatest performances.

A legal dispute arose in 1966 regarding a record contract that Hendrix had entered into the previous year with producer Ed Chalpin. After two years of litigation, the parties agreed to a resolution that granted Chalpin the distribution rights to an album of original Hendrix material. Hendrix decided that they would record the LP, "<a href="Band%20of%20Gypsys">Band of Gypsys</a>", during two live appearances. In preparation for the shows he formed an all-black power-trio with Cox and drummer <a href="Buddy%20Miles">Buddy Miles</a>, formerly with Wilson Pickett, <a href="the%20Electric%20Flag">the Electric Flag</a>, and the <a href="Buddy%20Miles%20Express">Buddy Miles Express</a>. Critic <a href="John%20Rockwell">John Rockwell</a> described Hendrix and Miles as jazz-rock fusionists, and their collaboration as pioneering. Others identified a <a href="funk">funk</a> and <a href="soul%20music">soul</a> influence in their music. <a href="Tour%20promoter">Concert promoter</a> Bill Graham called the shows "the most brilliant, emotional display of virtuoso electric guitar" that he had ever heard. Biographers have speculated that Hendrix formed the band in an effort to appease members of the <a href="Black%20Power">Black Power</a> movement and others in the black communities who called for him to use his fame to speak-up for civil rights.

Hendrix had been recording with Cox since April and jamming with Miles since September, and the trio wrote and rehearsed material which they performed at a series of four shows over two nights on December 31 and January 1, at the <a href="Fillmore%20East">Fillmore East</a>. They used recordings of these concerts to assemble the LP, which was produced by Hendrix. The album includes the track "<a href="Machine%20Gun%20%28Jimi%20Hendrix%20song%29">Machine Gun</a>", which musicologist Andy Aledort described as the pinnacle of Hendrix's career, and "the premiere example of [his] unparalleled genius as a rock guitarist ... In this performance, Jimi transcended the medium of rock music, and set an entirely new standard for the potential of electric guitar." During the song's extended instrumental breaks, Hendrix created sounds with his guitar that sonically represented warfare, including rockets, bombs, and diving planes.

The "Band of Gypsys" album was the only official live Hendrix LP made commercially available during his lifetime; several tracks from the Woodstock and Monterey shows were released later that year. The album was released in April 1970 by <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a>; it reached the top ten in both the U.S. and the UK. That same month a single was issued with "<a href="Stepping%20Stone%20%28Jimi%20Hendrix%20song%29">Stepping Stone</a>" as the A-side and "Izabella" as the B-side, but Hendrix was dissatisfied with the quality of the mastering and he demanded that it be withdrawn and re-mixed, preventing the songs from charting and resulting in Hendrix's least successful single; it was also his last.

On January 28, 1970, a third and final Band of Gypsys appearance took place; they performed during a music festival at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> benefiting the anti-Vietnam War <a href="Moratorium%20to%20End%20the%20War%20in%20Vietnam">Moratorium Committee</a> titled the "Winter Festival for Peace". American blues guitarist <a href="Johnny%20Winter">Johnny Winter</a> was backstage before the concert; he recalled: "[Hendrix] came in with his head down, sat on the couch alone, and put his head in his hands ... He didn't move until it was time for the show." Minutes after taking the stage he snapped a vulgar response at a woman who had shouted a request for "Foxy Lady". He then began playing "Earth Blues" before telling the audience: "That's what happens when earth fucks with space". Moments later, he briefly sat down on the drum riser before leaving the stage. Both Miles and Redding later stated that Jeffery had given Hendrix LSD before the performance. Miles believed that Jeffery gave Hendrix the drugs in an effort to sabotage the current band and bring about the return of the original Experience lineup. Jeffery fired Miles after the show and Cox quit, ending the Band of Gypsys.

Soon after the abruptly ended Band of Gypsys performance and their subsequent dissolution, Jeffery made arrangements to reunite the original Experience lineup. Although Hendrix, Mitchell, and Redding were interviewed by "Rolling Stone" in February 1970 as a united group, Hendrix never intended to work with Redding. When Redding returned to New York in anticipation of rehearsals with a re-formed Experience, he was told that he had been replaced with Cox. During an interview with "Rolling Stone" Keith Altham, Hendrix defended the decision: "It's nothing personal against Noel, but we finished what we were doing with the Experience and Billy's style of playing suits the new group better." Although the lineup of Hendrix, Mitchell, and Cox became known as the Cry of Love band, after their <a href="The%20Cry%20of%20Love%20Tour">accompanying tour</a>, billing, advertisements, and tickets were printed with the New Jimi Hendrix Experience or occasionally just Jimi Hendrix.

During the first half of 1970, Hendrix sporadically worked on material for what would have been his next LP. Many of the tracks were posthumously released in 1971 as "<a href="The%20Cry%20of%20Love">The Cry of Love</a>". He had started writing songs for the album in 1968, but in April 1970 he told Keith Altham that the project had been abandoned. Soon afterward, he and his band took a break from recording and began the Cry of Love tour at the <a href="L.A.%20Forum">L.A. Forum</a>, performing for 20,000 people. Set-lists during the tour included numerous Experience tracks as well as a selection of newer material. Several shows were recorded, and they produced some of Hendrix's most memorable live performances. At one of them, the second <a href="Atlanta%20International%20Pop%20Festival%20%281970%29">Atlanta International Pop Festival</a>, on July 4, he played to the largest American audience of his career. According to authors Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz, as many as 500,000 people attended the concert. On July 17, they appeared at the New York Pop Festival; Hendrix had again consumed too many drugs before the show, and the set was considered a disaster. The American leg of the tour, which included 32 performances, ended at <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>, Hawaii, on August 1, 1970. This would be Hendrix's final concert appearance in the U.S.

In 1968, Hendrix and Jeffery jointly invested in the purchase of the Generation Club in <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>. They had initially planned to reopen the establishment, but after an audit revealed that Hendrix had incurred exorbitant fees by block-booking lengthy sessions at peak rates they decided that the building would better serve them as a recording studio. With a facility of his own, Hendrix could work as much as he wanted while also reducing his recording expenditures, which had reached a reported $300,000 annually. Architect and <a href="acoustician">acoustician</a> <a href="John%20Storyk">John Storyk</a> designed <a href="Electric%20Lady%20Studios">Electric Lady Studios</a> for Hendrix, who requested that they avoid right angles where possible. With round windows, an ambient lighting machine, and a psychedelic mural, Storyk wanted the studio to have a relaxing environment that would encourage Hendrix's creativity. The project took twice as long as planned and cost twice as much as Hendrix and Jeffery had budgeted, with their total investment estimated at $1 million.

Hendrix first used Electric Lady on June 15, 1970, when he jammed with Steve Winwood and <a href="Chris%20Wood%20%28rock%20musician%29">Chris Wood</a> of Traffic; the next day, he recorded his first track there, "Night Bird Flying". The studio officially opened for business on August 25, and a grand opening party was held the following day. Immediately afterwards, Hendrix left for England; he never returned to the States. He boarded an Air India flight for London with Cox, joining Mitchell for a performance as the headlining act of the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight%20Festival%201970">Isle of Wight Festival</a>.

When the European leg of the Cry of Love tour began, Hendrix was longing for his new studio and creative outlet, and was not eager to fulfill the commitment. On September 2, 1970, he abandoned a performance in <a href="Aarhus">Aarhus</a> after three songs, stating: "I've been dead a long time". Four days later, he gave his final concert appearance, at the Isle of <a href="Fehmarn">Fehmarn</a> Festival in Germany. He was met with booing and jeering from fans in response to his cancellation of a show slated for the end of the previous night's bill due to torrential rain and risk of electrocution. Immediately following the festival, Hendrix, Mitchell, and Cox travelled to London.

Three days after the performance, Cox, who was suffering from severe <a href="paranoia">paranoia</a> after either taking LSD or being given it unknowingly, quit the tour and went to stay with his parents in Pennsylvania. Within days of Hendrix's arrival in England, he had spoken with Chas Chandler, <a href="Alan%20Douglas%20%28record%20producer%29">Alan Douglas</a>, and others about leaving his manager, Michael Jeffery. On September 16, Hendrix performed in public for the last time during an informal jam at <a href="Ronnie%20Scott%27s%20Jazz%20Club">Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club</a> in <a href="Soho">Soho</a> with <a href="Eric%20Burdon">Eric Burdon</a> and his latest band, <a href="War%20%28U.S.%20band%29">War</a>. They began by playing a few of their recent hits, and after a brief intermission Hendrix joined them during "Mother Earth" and "Tobacco Road". His performance was uncharacteristically subdued; he quietly played backing guitar, and refrained from the histrionics that people had come to expect from him. He died less than 48 hours later.

In July 1962, after Hendrix was discharged from the U.S. Army, he entered a small club in Clarksville, Tennessee. Drawn in by live music, he stopped for a drink and ended up spending most of the $400 he had saved. He explained: "I went in this jazz joint and had a drink. I liked it and I stayed. People tell me I get foolish, good-natured sometimes. Anyway, I guess I felt real benevolent that day. I must have been handing out bills to anyone that asked me. I came out of that place with sixteen dollars left." According to the authors Steven Roby and Brad Schreiber: "Alcohol would later be the scourge of his existence, driving him to fits of pique, even rare bursts of atypical, physical violence."

While Roby and Schreiber assert that Hendrix first used <a href="Lysergic%20acid%20diethylamide">LSD</a> when he met Linda Keith in late 1966, according to the authors Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek, the earliest that Hendrix is known to have taken it was in June 1967, while attending the Monterey Pop Festival. According to Hendrix biographer Charles Cross, the subject of drugs came up one evening in 1966 at Keith's New York apartment; when one of Keith's friends offered Hendrix "acid", a street name for lysergic acid diethylamide, Hendrix asked for LSD instead, showing what Cross described as "his naivete and his complete inexperience with psychedelics". Before that, Hendrix had only sporadically used drugs, with his experimentation limited to <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">cannabis</a>, <a href="hashish">hashish</a>, <a href="Substituted%20amphetamine">amphetamines</a> and occasionally <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a>. After 1967, he regularly smoked cannabis and hashish, and used LSD and amphetamines, particularly while touring. According to Cross, by the time of his death in September 1970, "few stars were as closely associated with the drug culture as Jimi".

Hendrix would often become angry and violent when he drank too much alcohol or when he mixed alcohol with drugs. His friend Herbie Worthington explained: "You wouldn't expect somebody with that kind of love to be that violent ... He just couldn't drink ... he simply turned into a bastard". According to journalist and friend Sharon Lawrence, Hendrix "admitted he could not handle hard liquor, which set off a bottled-up anger, a destructive fury he almost never displayed otherwise".

In January 1968, the Experience travelled to Sweden for a one-week tour of Europe. During the early morning hours of the first day, Hendrix became engaged in a drunken brawl in the Hotel Opalen, in <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a>, smashing a plate-glass window and injuring his right hand, for which he received medical treatment. The incident culminated in his arrest and release, pending a court appearance that resulted in a large fine.

After the 1969 burglary of a house Hendrix was renting in <a href="Benedict%20Canyon">Benedict Canyon</a>, California, and while he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol, he punched his friend Paul Caruso and accused him of the theft. He then chased Caruso away from the residence while throwing stones at him. A few days later, one of Hendrix's girlfriends, Carmen Borrero, required stitches after he hit her above her eye with a vodka bottle during a drunken, jealous rage.

On May 3, 1969, while Hendrix was passing through customs at <a href="Toronto%20Pearson%20International%20Airport">Toronto International Airport</a>, authorities detained him after finding a small amount of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, he was formally charged with drug possession and released on $10,000 bail. He was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial, which took place in December of that year. For the Crown to prove possession they had to show that Hendrix knew the drugs were there. During the jury trial he testified that a fan had given him a vial of what he thought was legal medication, which he put in his bag not knowing what was in it. He was acquitted of the charges. Mitchell and Redding later revealed that everyone had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto; both men also stated they believed that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag without his knowledge.

Although the details of Hendrix's last day and death are widely disputed, he spent much of September 17, 1970, in London with <a href="Monika%20Dannemann">Monika Dannemann</a>, the only witness to his final hours. Dannemann said that she prepared a meal for them at her apartment in the Samarkand Hotel, 22 <a href="Lansdowne%20Crescent%2C%20London">Lansdowne Crescent</a>, <a href="Notting%20Hill">Notting Hill</a>, sometime around 11 p.m., when they shared a bottle of wine. She drove Hendrix to the residence of an acquaintance at approximately 1:45 a.m., where he remained for about an hour before she picked him up and drove them back to her flat at 3 a.m. Dannemann said they talked until around 7 a.m., when they went to sleep. She awoke around 11 a.m., and found Hendrix breathing, but unconscious and unresponsive. She called for an ambulance at 11:18 a.m., which arrived on the scene at 11:27 a.m. Paramedics then transported Hendrix to <a href="St%20Mary%20Abbot%27s%20Hospital">St Mary Abbot's Hospital</a> where Dr. John Bannister pronounced him dead at 12:45 p.m. on September 18, 1970.

To determine the cause of death, <a href="coroner">coroner</a> Gavin Thurston ordered a <a href="Autopsy">post-mortem</a> examination on Hendrix's body, which was performed on September 21 by Professor <a href="Robert%20Donald%20Teare">Robert Donald Teare</a>, a <a href="Forensic%20pathology">forensic pathologist</a>. Thurston completed the <a href="inquest">inquest</a> on September 28, and concluded that Hendrix <a href="Pulmonary%20aspiration">aspirated</a> his own <a href="vomit">vomit</a> and died of <a href="asphyxia">asphyxia</a> while intoxicated with <a href="barbiturate">barbiturate</a>s. Citing "insufficient evidence of the circumstances", he declared an <a href="open%20verdict">open verdict</a>. Dannemann later revealed that Hendrix had taken nine of her prescribed <a href="secobarbital/brallobarbital/hydroxyzine">Vesparax</a> sleeping tablets, 18 times the recommended dosage.

After Hendrix's body had been embalmed by <a href="Desmond%20Henley">Desmond Henley</a>, it was flown to Seattle, Washington, on September 29, 1970. After a service at Dunlap Baptist Church in Seattle's Rainier Valley on October 1, it was interred at <a href="Greenwood%20Memorial%20Park%20%28Renton%2C%20Washington%29">Greenwood Cemetery</a> in <a href="Renton%2C%20Washington">Renton, Washington</a>, the location of his mother's grave. Hendrix's family and friends traveled in 24 limousines and more than 200 people attended the funeral, including several notable musicians such as original Experience members Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, as well as <a href="Miles%20Davis">Miles Davis</a>, <a href="John%20P.%20Hammond">John Hammond</a>, and <a href="Johnny%20Winter">Johnny Winter</a>.

By 1967, as Hendrix was gaining in popularity, many of his pre-Experience recordings were marketed to an unsuspecting public as Jimi Hendrix albums, sometimes with misleading later images of Hendrix. The recordings, which came under the control of producer Ed Chalpin of <a href="PPX%20Enterprises">PPX</a>, with whom Hendrix had signed a recording contract in 1965, were often re-mixed between their repeated reissues, and licensed to record companies such as <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca</a> and Capitol. Hendrix publicly denounced the releases, describing them as "malicious" and "greatly inferior", stating: "At PPX, we spent on average about one hour recording a song. Today I spend at least twelve hours on each song." These unauthorized releases have long constituted a substantial part of his recording catalogue, amounting to hundreds of albums.

Some of Hendrix's <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix%27s%20unfinished%20fourth%20studio%20album">unfinished material</a> was released as the 1971 title "The Cry of Love". Although the album reached number three in the U.S. and number two in the UK, producers Mitchell and Kramer later complained that they were unable to make use of all the available songs because some tracks were used for 1971's "<a href="Rainbow%20Bridge%20%28album%29">Rainbow Bridge</a>"; still others were issued on 1972's "<a href="War%20Heroes">War Heroes</a>". Material from "The Cry of Love" was re-released in 1997 as "<a href="First%20Rays%20of%20the%20New%20Rising%20Sun">First Rays of the New Rising Sun</a>", along with the other tracks that Mitchell and Kramer had wanted to include.

In 1993, <a href="MCA%20Records">MCA Records</a> delayed a multimillion-dollar sale of Hendrix's publishing copyrights because Al Hendrix was unhappy about the arrangement. He acknowledged that he had sold distribution rights to a foreign corporation in 1974, but stated that it did not include copyrights and argued that he had retained veto power of the sale of the catalogue. Under a settlement reached in July 1995, Al Hendrix prevailed in his legal battle and regained control of his son's song and image rights. He subsequently licensed the recordings to MCA through the family-run company Experience Hendrix LLC, formed in 1995. In August 2009, Experience Hendrix announced that it had entered a new licensing agreement with <a href="Sony%20Music%20Entertainment">Sony Music Entertainment</a>'s <a href="Legacy%20Recordings">Legacy Recordings</a> division which would take effect in 2010. Legacy and Experience Hendrix launched the 2010, Jimi Hendrix Catalog Project, starting with the release of "<a href="Valleys%20of%20Neptune">Valleys of Neptune</a>" in March of that year. In the months before his death, Hendrix recorded demos for a concept album tentatively titled "<a href="Black%20Gold%20%28Jimi%20Hendrix%20recordings%29">Black Gold</a>", which are now in the possession of Experience Hendrix LLC; , no official release date has been announced.

Hendrix played a variety of guitars throughout his career, but the instrument that became most associated with him was the <a href="Fender%20Stratocaster">Fender Stratocaster</a>. He acquired his first Stratocaster in 1966, when a girlfriend loaned him enough money to purchase a used one that had been built around 1964. He thereafter used the model prevalently during performances and recordings. In 1967, he described the instrument as "the best all-around guitar for the stuff we're doing"; he praised its "bright treble and deep bass sounds".

With few exceptions, Hendrix played right-handed guitars that were turned upside down and restrung for left-hand playing. This had an important effect on the sound of his guitar; because of the slant of the bridge pickup, his lowest string had a brighter sound while his highest string had a darker sound, which was the opposite of the Stratocaster's intended design. In addition to Stratocasters, Hendrix also used Fender <a href="Fender%20Jazzmaster">Jazzmasters</a>, <a href="Fender%20Duosonic">Duosonics</a>, two different <a href="Gibson%20Flying%20V">Gibson Flying V</a>s, a <a href="Gibson%20Les%20Paul">Gibson Les Paul</a>, three <a href="Gibson%20SG">Gibson SG</a>s, a Gretsch Corvette, and a <a href="Fender%20Jaguar">Fender Jaguar</a>. He used a white Gibson SG Custom for his performances on "The Dick Cavett Show" in September 1969, and a black Gibson Flying V during the Isle of Wight festival in 1970.

During 1965, and 1966, while Hendrix was playing back-up for soul and R&B acts in the U.S., he used an 85-watt <a href="Fender%20Twin">Fender Twin</a> Reverb amplifier. When Chandler brought Hendrix to England in October 1966, he supplied him with 30-watt <a href="Burns%20London">Burns amps</a>, which Hendrix thought were too small for his needs. After an early London gig when he was unable to use his preferred Fender Twin, he asked about the Marshall amps that he had noticed other groups using. Years earlier, Mitch Mitchell had taken drum lessons from the amp builder, <a href="Marshall%20Amplification">Jim Marshall</a>, and he introduced Hendrix to Marshall. At their initial meeting, Hendrix bought four speaker cabinets and three 100-watt <a href="Marshall%201959">Super Lead</a> amplifiers; he would grow accustomed to using all three in unison. The equipment arrived on October 11, 1966, and the Experience used the new gear during their first tour. Marshall amps were well-suited for Hendrix's needs, and they were paramount in the evolution of his heavily overdriven sound, enabling him to master the use of feedback as a musical effect, creating what author <a href="Paul%20Trynka">Paul Trynka</a> described as a "definitive vocabulary for rock guitar". Hendrix usually turned all of the amplifier's control knobs to the maximum level, which became known as the Hendrix setting. During the four years prior to his death, he purchased between 50 and 100 Marshall amplifiers. Jim Marshall said that he was "the greatest ambassador" his company ever had.

One of Hendrix's signature <a href="effects%20unit">effects</a> was the <a href="wah-wah%20pedal">wah-wah pedal</a>, which he first heard used with an electric guitar in Cream's "<a href="Tales%20of%20Brave%20Ulysses">Tales of Brave Ulysses</a>", released in May 1967. In July of that year, while playing gigs at the Scene club in New York City, Hendrix met <a href="Frank%20Zappa">Frank Zappa</a>, whose band, <a href="the%20Mothers%20of%20Invention">the Mothers of Invention</a> were performing at the adjacent Garrick Theater. Hendrix was fascinated by Zappa's application of the pedal, and he experimented with one later that evening. He used a wah pedal during the opening to "<a href="Voodoo%20Child%20%28Slight%20Return%29">Voodoo Child (Slight Return)</a>", creating one of the best-known wah-wah riffs of the classic rock era. He can also be heard using the effect on "<a href="Up%20from%20the%20Skies">Up from the Skies</a>", "Little Miss Lover", and "Still Raining, Still Dreaming".

Hendrix consistently used a <a href="Dallas%20Arbiter">Dallas Arbiter</a> <a href="Fuzz%20Face">Fuzz Face</a> and a <a href="Vox%20%28musical%20equipment%29">Vox</a> wah pedal during recording sessions and live performances, but he also experimented with other guitar effects. He enjoyed a fruitful long-term collaboration with electronics enthusiast <a href="Roger%20Mayer%20%28engineer%29">Roger Mayer</a>, whom he once called "the secret" of his sound. Mayer introduced him to the <a href="Octavia%20%28effects%20pedal%29">Octavia</a>, an octave doubling effect pedal, in December 1966, and he first recorded with the effect during the guitar solo to "Purple Haze".

Hendrix also utilized the <a href="Uni-Vibe">Uni-Vibe</a>, which was designed to simulate the modulation effects of a rotating <a href="Leslie%20speaker">Leslie speaker</a> by providing a rich phasing sound that could be manipulated with a speed control pedal. He can be heard using the effect during his performance at Woodstock and on the Band of Gypsys track "Machine Gun", which prominently features the Uni-vibe along with an Octavia and a Fuzz Face. His signal flow for live performance involved first plugging his guitar into a wah-wah pedal, then connecting the wah-wah pedal to a Fuzz Face, which was then linked to a Uni-Vibe, before connecting to a Marshall amplifier.

As an adolescent during the 1950s, Hendrix became interested in <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> artists such as <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, <a href="Little%20Richard">Little Richard</a>, and <a href="Chuck%20Berry">Chuck Berry</a>. In 1968, he told "Guitar Player" magazine that <a href="electric%20blues">electric blues</a> artists Muddy Waters, <a href="Elmore%20James">Elmore James</a>, and B.B. King inspired him during the beginning of his career; he also cited <a href="Eddie%20Cochran">Eddie Cochran</a> as an early influence. Of Muddy Waters, the first electric guitarist of which Hendrix became aware, he said: "I heard one of his records when I was a little boy and "it scared me to death" because I heard all of these "sounds"." In 1970, he told "Rolling Stone" that he was a fan of <a href="western%20swing">western swing</a> artist <a href="Bob%20Wills">Bob Wills</a> and while he lived in Nashville, the television show the <a href="Grand%20Ole%20Opry">Grand Ole Opry</a>.

Cox stated that during their time serving in the U.S. military, he and Hendrix primarily listened to southern blues artists such as <a href="Jimmy%20Reed">Jimmy Reed</a> and <a href="Albert%20King">Albert King</a>. According to Cox, "King was a very, very powerful influence". Howlin' Wolf also inspired Hendrix, who performed Wolf's "Killing Floor" as the opening song of his U.S. debut at the Monterey Pop Festival. The influence of soul artist <a href="Curtis%20Mayfield">Curtis Mayfield</a> can be heard in Hendrix's guitar playing, and the influence of Bob Dylan can be heard in Hendrix's songwriting; he was known to play Dylan's records repeatedly, particularly "<a href="Highway%2061%20Revisited">Highway 61 Revisited</a>" and "<a href="Blonde%20on%20Blonde">Blonde on Blonde</a>".

The Experience's <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> biography states: "Jimi Hendrix was arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music. Hendrix expanded the range and vocabulary of the electric guitar into areas no musician had ever ventured before. His boundless drive, technical ability and creative application of such effects as wah-wah and distortion forever transformed the sound of rock and roll." Musicologist Andy Aledort described Hendrix as "one of the most creative" and "influential musicians that has ever lived". Music journalist <a href="Chuck%20Philips">Chuck Philips</a> wrote: "In a field almost exclusively populated by white musicians, Hendrix has served as a role model for a cadre of young black rockers. His achievement was to reclaim title to a musical form pioneered by black innovators like Little Richard and Chuck Berry in the 1950s."

Hendrix favored <a href="overdrive%20%28music%29">overdriven</a> amplifiers with high volume and <a href="Gain%20%28electronics%29">gain</a>. He was instrumental in developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar <a href="Guitar%20feedback">amplifier feedback</a>, and helped to popularize use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock. He rejected the standard <a href="barre%20chord">barre chord</a> fretting technique used by most guitarists in favor of fretting the low 6th string root notes with his thumb. He applied this technique during the beginning bars of "<a href="Little%20Wing">Little Wing</a>", which allowed him to sustain the root note of chords while also playing melody. This method has been described as piano style, with the thumb playing what a pianist's left hand would play and the other fingers playing melody as a right hand. Having spent several years fronting a trio, he developed an ability to play rhythm chords and lead lines together, giving the audio impression that more than one guitarist was performing. He was the first artist to incorporate <a href="stereophonic%20sound">stereophonic</a> phasing effects in rock music recordings. Holly George-Warren of "Rolling Stone" commented: "Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began." According to <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a>, Hendrix's 1965 recordings with the Isley Brothers, such as "Move Over and Let Me Dance", "anticipate effects [Eric] Clapton introduced on '<a href="Sunshine%20of%20Your%20Love">Sunshine of Your Love</a>,' but in a less inflated context". Aledort wrote: "In rock guitar, there are but two eras—before Hendrix and after Hendrix."

While creating his unique musical voice and guitar style, Hendrix synthesized diverse genres, including blues, R&B, soul, <a href="British%20rock">British rock</a>, <a href="American%20folk%20music">American folk music</a>, 1950s rock and roll, and jazz. Musicologist David Moskowitz emphasized the importance of blues music in Hendrix's playing style, and according to authors Steven Roby and Brad Schreiber, "[He] explored the outer reaches of <a href="psychedelic%20rock">psychedelic rock</a>". His influence is evident in a variety of popular music formats, and he has contributed significantly to the development of <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a>, <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a>, funk, <a href="post-punk">post-punk</a>, <a href="grunge">grunge</a>, and <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop music</a>. His lasting influence on modern guitar players is difficult to overstate; his techniques and delivery have been abundantly imitated by others. Despite his hectic touring schedule and notorious perfectionism, he was a prolific recording artist who left behind numerous unreleased recordings. More than 40 years after his death, Hendrix remains as popular as ever, with annual album sales exceeding that of any year during his lifetime.

Hendrix has influenced numerous funk and <a href="funk%20rock">funk rock</a> artists, including <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a>, <a href="George%20Clinton%20%28musician%29">George Clinton</a>, <a href="John%20Frusciante">John Frusciante</a>, formerly of the <a href="Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>, <a href="Eddie%20Hazel">Eddie Hazel</a> of <a href="Funkadelic">Funkadelic</a>, and <a href="Ernie%20Isley">Ernie Isley</a> of the Isley Brothers. Grunge guitarists such as <a href="Jerry%20Cantrell">Jerry Cantrell</a> of <a href="Alice%20in%20Chains">Alice in Chains</a>, and <a href="Mike%20McCready">Mike McCready</a> and <a href="Stone%20Gossard">Stone Gossard</a> of <a href="Pearl%20Jam">Pearl Jam</a> have cited Hendrix as an influence.
