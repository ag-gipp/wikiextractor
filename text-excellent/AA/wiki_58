Ford Piquette Avenue Plant

The Ford Piquette Avenue Plant is a former factory located within the <a href="Milwaukee%20Junction">Milwaukee Junction</a> area of <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, Michigan, in the United States. Built in 1904, it was the second center of automobile production for the <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford Motor Company</a>, after the <a href="Ford%20Mack%20Avenue%20Plant">Ford Mack Avenue Plant</a>. At the Piquette Avenue Plant, the company created and first produced the <a href="Ford%20Model%20T">Ford Model T</a>, the car credited with initiating the mass use of automobiles in the United States. Prior to the Model T, several other car models were assembled at the factory. Early experiments using a moving <a href="assembly%20line">assembly line</a> to make cars were also conducted there. It was also the first factory where more than 100 cars were assembled in one day. While it was headquartered at the Piquette Avenue Plant, Ford Motor Company became the biggest U.S.-based automaker, and it would remain so until the mid-1920s. The factory was used by the company until 1910, when its car production activity was relocated to the new, bigger <a href="Highland%20Park%20Ford%20Plant">Highland Park Ford Plant</a>.

<a href="Studebaker">Studebaker</a> bought the factory in 1911, using it to assemble cars until 1933. The building was sold in 1936, going through a series of owners for the rest of the 20th century before becoming a museum in 2001. The Piquette Avenue Plant is the oldest purpose-built automotive factory building open to the public. The museum, which was visited by 18,000 people in 2016, has exhibits that primarily focus on the beginning of the <a href="automotive%20industry%20in%20the%20United%20States">United States automotive industry</a>. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002, became a Michigan State Historic Site in 2003, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2006.

<a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a>, Detroit coal merchant <a href="Alexander%20Y.%20Malcomson">Alexander Y. Malcomson</a>, and a group of investors <a href="History%20of%20Ford%20Motor%20Company">formed the Ford Motor Company</a> on June 16, 1903, to assemble automobiles. The company's first car model, the <a href="Ford%20Model%20A%20%281903%E2%80%9304%29">original Ford Model A</a>, began to be assembled that same month at the <a href="Ford%20Mack%20Avenue%20Plant">Ford Mack Avenue Plant</a>, a rented wagon manufacturing shop in Detroit, Michigan. The company quickly outgrew this facility and, on April 10, 1904, bought a parcel of land off of Piquette Avenue in Detroit to accommodate a larger factory. The land was located in the <a href="Milwaukee%20Junction">Milwaukee Junction</a> area, whose name is derived from a <a href="junction%20%28rail%29">railroad junction</a> within it. The Ford Piquette Avenue Plant's construction started on May 10, 1904. The company moved into its new factory the following October.

The Detroit-based architectural firm Field, Hinchman & Smith designed the Piquette Avenue Plant. It is an example of late Victorian-style architecture and was modeled after <a href="New%20England">New England</a> textile mills. Designing factories based on this type of mill was common practice in the United States at the time. The building is three stories high, wide, and long. Its load-bearing exterior brick walls contain 355 windows, and its <a href="maple">maple</a> floors, supported by square <a href="oak">oak</a> beams and posts, cover . The Piquette Avenue Plant contains two elevator-stairwell combinations, one located on its northwest corner and the other located on its southwest side. Recalling a fire in March 1901 that destroyed the <a href="Oldsmobile">Olds Motor Works</a> factory in Detroit, Henry Ford and the architects included a <a href="fire%20sprinkler%20system">fire sprinkler system</a> in the building's design, a rare feature for industrial buildings of the period. This and several other original safety features in the factory, such as its firewalls, fire doors, and <a href="fire%20escapes">fire escapes</a>, are still present. Water for the sprinkler system was supplied by a wooden <a href="water%20tank">water tank</a> located on the building's roof. A brick <a href="power%20station">powerhouse</a>, measuring wide by long, was the original electricity provider for the factory, and was located near its northwest corner. The water tank and powerhouse no longer exist.
From October 1904 to the end of 1909, Ford Motor Company assembled car models B, C, F, K, N, R, S, and T at the Piquette Avenue Plant. Ford models B and C were the first car models produced at the factory starting in late 1904, and production of the Ford Model F began the following February. The vast majority of factory tasks were done by men, except for <a href="ignition%20magneto">magneto</a> assembly, which was done by women. Hand tools were used for the assembly work at fixed stations, and the completed components would be brought by hand to the <a href="chassis">chassis</a> for final assembly. Completed cars were shipped to the company's distributors and dealers by rail using a <a href="branch%20line">spur line</a> behind the building, which connected to a <a href="Michigan%20Central%20Railroad">Michigan Central Railroad</a> <a href="main%20line%20%28railway%29">main line</a>. Due to variations in demand and car model changeover, the number of employees varied constantly, ranging from as low as 300 to as high as 700. The company did not recognize <a href="trade%20union">labor unions</a> at the factory. Ford Motor Company was a member of the Employers’ Association of Detroit, an organization that prevented most of the city's factories from unionizing until the 1930s.

In 1905, Ford Motor Company was the fourth-largest car producer in the United States, behind <a href="Cadillac">Cadillac</a>, <a href="Rambler%20%28automobile%29">Rambler</a>, and Oldsmobile. In the company's early years, most major components in its cars were manufactured by outside companies, including the "running gear" (the chassis, <a href="petrol%20engine">engine</a>, <a href="transmission%20%28mechanics%29">transmission</a>, <a href="drive%20shaft">drive shaft</a>, and <a href="axle">axle</a>s), which was supplied by the <a href="Dodge">Dodge Brothers Company</a>. That began to change in early 1906, when the Ford Manufacturing Company, a new, separate company created by Henry Ford and some Ford Motor Company stockholders, started to make engines and transmissions for the upcoming Ford Model N. The Ford Manufacturing Company was located at the Bellevue Avenue Plant, a leased factory off of Bellevue Avenue in Detroit. The Bellevue Avenue Plant was used until 1908, by which time almost all manufacturing of major components for Ford Motor Company cars was taking place at the Piquette Avenue Plant. Model N production began at the Piquette Avenue Plant in July 1906. That same month, Henry Ford bought the Ford Motor Company shares owned by fellow company co-founder Alexander Malcomson. While Malcomson was with the company, he and Henry Ford disagreed over the type of car that the company should produce. Malcomson preferred expensive cars, like the Ford Model K; Henry Ford favored inexpensive cars, like the Model N. Once Malcomson was no longer part of the company, Henry Ford, now with uncontested control, focused the company's efforts towards making cheap cars exclusively. The success of the Model N made Ford Motor Company the largest automaker in the United States by the end of 1906, a distinction that it would hold for twenty years.

In January 1907, in a room located on the Piquette Avenue Plant's third floor in the northeast corner, the design process began for the Ford Model T, the car credited with starting the mass use of cars in the United States. Much of the design and experimental work for the new car was done by Henry Ford, <a href="drafter">draftsman</a> <a href="J%C3%B3zsef%20Galamb">Joseph Galamb</a>, <a href="engineer">engineer</a> <a href="Childe%20Wills">Childe Harold Wills</a>, and <a href="machinist">machinist</a> C.J. Smith. <a href="Vanadium%23Alloys">Vanadium steel</a>, an alloy lighter and stronger than standard steel, which was first used sparingly with the Ford Model N, R, and S, was used extensively with the Model T. The company revealed the plans for the Model T to its dealers on March 19, 1908.

During July 1908, a few months before the Model T's introduction, a group of Piquette Avenue Plant employees experimented with the concept of using a moving assembly line to make cars, where the chassis would be moved to the workers for components to be installed. This effort was led by <a href="Charles%20E.%20Sorensen">Charles E. Sorensen</a>, the assistant to <a href="Peter%20E.%20Martin">Peter E. Martin</a>, who was the factory's superintendent. Sorensen believed that a moving assembly line would make car assembly faster, simpler, and easier. The experiments consisted of tying a rope to a Model N chassis and pulling it across the factory's third floor on skids until its axles and wheels were added. The chassis would then be rolled across the floor in notches, where specific components would be attached. At least one Model N was completed at the Piquette Avenue Plant using this process. Although Henry Ford encouraged these experiments, he did not implement a formal moving assembly line at the Piquette Avenue Plant, as all of his attention was focused on getting Model T production started on time. Despite not having a moving assembly line, the Piquette Avenue Plant, aided by the usage of <a href="interchangeable%20parts">interchangeable parts</a> and other production improvements, produced 101 completed cars in a single day on June 4, 1908, an auto industry record at the time.

The first production Model T was completed at the Piquette Avenue Plant on September 27, 1908. On May 1, 1909, due to overwhelming demand, Ford Motor Company stopped taking Model T orders for two months. To satisfy the unprecedented demand for the Model T, the company moved most of its car production activity to the new, larger Highland Park Ford Plant in <a href="Highland%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Highland Park, Michigan</a>, by January 1910. The company completely vacated the Piquette Avenue Plant by October 1910. The concept of using a moving assembly line to manufacture cars would be fully implemented at the Highland Park Ford Plant, starting on October 7, 1913. Over 15 million Model Ts would eventually be built, and the first 14,000 made in the United States were assembled at the Piquette Avenue Plant.

The Ford Piquette Avenue Plant was sold in January 1911 to Studebaker, a major maker of various <a href="horse-drawn%20vehicle">horse-drawn road vehicles</a> since the 1850s. That same year, when the railroad spur line serving the factory was raised above street level, the loading dock behind the building was replaced with an elevated platform, level with the second floor. Also in 1911, Studebaker acquired the <a href="E-M-F%20Company">E-M-F Company</a>, which owned a different car manufacturing complex on Piquette Avenue. Studebaker began to put its name on the cars formerly produced by the E-M-F Company in 1912. In 1920, Studebaker built a four-story, <a href="reinforced%20concrete">reinforced concrete</a> building, known as the "Studebaker Detroit Service Building", immediately west of the Piquette Avenue Plant. The Detroit Service Building was connected to the Piquette Avenue Plant's southwest corner on the second and third floors, which created a ground-level, drive-through access point to the court between the two buildings. In 1926, the elevator-stairwell combination on the Piquette Avenue Plant's southwest side was moved slightly northwards to create easier access between the two buildings on their second and third floors. Also in 1926, the machinery for both of the Piquette Avenue Plant's elevators was replaced. Studebaker used the Piquette Avenue Plant for car production until 1933.

In 1936, Studebaker sold the Piquette Avenue Plant to the <a href="3M">Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M)</a>, a producer of rubber auto parts and non-adhesive paper tape. Around 1937, the powerhouse and several other small buildings previously built by Ford Motor Company west of the factory were demolished. The Cadillac Overall Company, a work clothes supplier, purchased the building in 1968. The Heritage Investment Company bought the building in 1989 and owned it until 2000. Since the early 1990s, a company named "General Linen & Uniform Service" has occupied part of the Piquette Avenue Plant's first floor. The Detroit Service Building next door is now used by <a href="Henry%20Ford%20Health%20System">Henry Ford Health System</a> to store medical records. The openings that previously allowed direct access between the two buildings on the second and third floors are now sealed. The Piquette Avenue Plant still stands in spite of the <a href="decline%20of%20Detroit">decline of Detroit</a>, which began in the mid-20th century.

The Ford Piquette Avenue Plant was sold to the Model T Automotive Heritage Complex in April 2000. Model T Automotive Heritage Complex is a <a href="501%28c%29%283%29%20organization">501(c)(3)</a> <a href="nonprofit%20organization">nonprofit organization</a> that has run the building as a museum since July 27, 2001. The Piquette Avenue Plant is the oldest purpose-built automotive factory building open to the public. The museum, located north of <a href="Midtown%20Detroit">Midtown Detroit</a> at 461 Piquette Street, attracted 18,000 visitors from over 50 countries in 2016. It contains over 40 early automobiles built by Ford Motor Company and other <a href="Metro%20Detroit">Detroit-area</a> car makers, as well as recreations of Henry Ford's office and the room where the Ford Model T was designed. One of the cars on display is Model T Serial No. 220, which was built at the factory in December 1908, and is one of the oldest surviving examples of that car model. Although the museum's regular operating days are Wednesdays through Sundays from April through November, it has been open on select days in January in the past. These January open days coincide with the annual <a href="North%20American%20International%20Auto%20Show">North American International Auto Show</a>, which takes place at <a href="Cobo%20Center">Cobo Center</a> in <a href="Downtown%20Detroit">Downtown Detroit</a>.

The Piquette Avenue Plant was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002, designated as a Michigan State Historic Site in 2003, and became a National Historic Landmark in 2006. The building has also been a contributing property for the surrounding Piquette Avenue Industrial Historic District since 2004. The factory's front façade was fully restored to its 1904 appearance and revealed to the public on September 27, 2008, the 100th anniversary of the completion of the first production Model T. On August 11, 2011, Model T Automotive Heritage Complex membership chairman Tom Genova was honored with a ROSE Award from the Detroit Metro Convention & Visitors Bureau in the Volunteers category. On May 18, 2012, the Model T Automotive Heritage Complex won a NAAMY Award from the National Association of Automobile Museums in the Films and Videos category for Division I (museums with budgets less than $300,000). On November 10, 2015, the Window Restoration Team at the Piquette Avenue Plant received a <a href="MotorCities%20National%20Heritage%20Area">MotorCities National Heritage Area</a> Award of Excellence in the Preservation category. Around 2016, the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> considered adding the Piquette Avenue Plant to a list of places in the United States eligible for UNESCO <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> status. It was ultimately not added, because it did not have enough of its original factory equipment, and because of recommendations that its nomination be expanded to include other Detroit-area Ford Motor Company sites, such as the Highland Park Ford Plant and the <a href="Ford%20River%20Rouge%20Complex">Ford River Rouge Complex</a>.

Lawrence Weathers

Lawrence Carthage Weathers, (14 May 1890 – 29 September 1918) was a New Zealand-born <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20Victoria%20Cross%20recipients">Australian recipient</a> of the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, the highest award for <a href="courage">gallantry</a> in battle that can be awarded to a member of the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian armed forces</a>. His parents returned to their native <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> when Weathers was seven, and he completed his schooling before obtaining work as an <a href="Funeral%20director">undertaker</a> in <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>. He enlisted as a <a href="private%20%28rank%29">private</a> in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) in early 1916, and joined the <a href="43rd%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">43rd Battalion</a>. His unit deployed to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in France and Belgium in late December. After a bout of illness, Weathers returned to his battalion in time to take part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Messines%20%281917%29">Battle of Messines</a> in June 1917, during which he was wounded. Evacuated to the United Kingdom, he rejoined his unit in early December.

Promoted to <a href="lance%20corporal">lance corporal</a> in March 1918, Weathers fought with his battalion during the German <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a>, but was <a href="Chemical%20warfare">gassed</a> in May and did not return to his unit until the following month. He participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hamel">Battle of Hamel</a> in July, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Amiens%20%281918%29">Battle of Amiens</a> in August, and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mont%20Saint-Quentin">Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin</a> in September. At Mont Saint-Quentin he was recommended for the award of the Victoria Cross. Promoted to temporary <a href="corporal">corporal</a>, he was mortally wounded in the head by a shell on 29 September during the <a href="Battle%20of%20St%20Quentin%20Canal">Battle of St Quentin Canal</a>, and died soon after, never having been aware that he was to receive the Victoria Cross, which was not announced until late December. , his Victoria Cross was in private hands.

Lawrence Carthage Weathers was born in <a href="Te%20Kopuru">Te Kopuru</a>, near <a href="Dargaville%2C%20New%20Zealand">Dargaville, New Zealand</a>, on 14 May 1890, one of eight children of John Joseph Weathers, a <a href="sheep%20farming">pastoralist</a>, and his wife Ellen Frances Johanna McCormack. Both his parents were from <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>, and the family returned there when he was seven years old. They settled in the rural mid-north of the state and Weathers attended <a href="Snowtown%2C%20South%20Australia">Snowtown</a> Public School. After leaving school, in 1909 he and two of his brothers travelled to Europe and America, including a four-month stay in England. Having spent two years away, he returned to Australia and worked as a horse handler, coachman, and as an <a href="Funeral%20director">undertaker</a> in Adelaide. On 10 September 1913, he married Annie Elizabeth "Tess" Watson of <a href="Unley%2C%20South%20Australia">Unley</a>. The couple lived in the suburbs of <a href="Rosewater%2C%20South%20Australia">Yatala</a> and <a href="Parkside%2C%20South%20Australia">Parkside</a>, and had two children. Weathers' elder brother Thomas enlisted to serve in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and died of wounds during the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a> of 1915, while serving with the <a href="9th%20Light%20Horse%20Regiment">9th Light Horse Regiment</a>. His younger brother Joseph also enlisted, but was discharged at his own request before leaving Australia.

On 8 February 1916, Weathers enlisted as a <a href="private%20%28rank%29">private</a> in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF), and was initially allotted as a reinforcement to the <a href="10th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">10th Battalion</a>. In June he was transferred to the <a href="43rd%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">43rd Battalion</a>, part of the <a href="11th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">11th Brigade</a>, <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">3rd Division</a>. The 43rd Battalion embarked on <a href="SS%20Afric">HMAT "Afric"</a> in June 1916, and after a brief stop in the Middle East and transit through France, spent the rest of the year training at <a href="Larkhill">Larkhill</a> on the <a href="Salisbury%20Plain">Salisbury Plain</a> in southern England. The 3rd Division embarked for the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in November, and entered the trenches for the first time in late December. Weathers reported sick in late January 1917, and did not rejoin his unit until late April. He returned to the front lines in time to participate in the first major action his battalion saw in the war, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Messines%20%281917%29">Battle of Messines</a>, during which the 43rd Battalion incurred 122 casualties in a night-time operation to capture the final objective, the Oosttaverne Line. One of those casualties was Weathers, who suffered a gunshot wound to the leg on 10 June. Evacuated to hospital in the United Kingdom, he did not return to his unit until early December. The 3rd Division spent the winter of 1917–1918 rotating through the front lines in the <a href="Mesen">Messines</a> sector of the <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> region of Belgium, largely improving the trenches against an expected German offensive in the spring.

Weathers was promoted to <a href="lance%20corporal">lance corporal</a> on 21 March 1918, and a week later his battalion helped blunt the German <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a>, taking up defensive positions between the <a href="Ancre">Ancre</a> and the <a href="Somme%20%28river%29">Somme</a> rivers west of <a href="Morlancourt">Morlancourt</a>. In late May he required medical treatment following a <a href="Chemical%20warfare">gas attack</a> near <a href="Villers-Bretonneux">Villers-Bretonneux</a> that caused 230 casualties among the 43rd, and Weathers did not return to duty until mid-June.

The 43rd Battalion's next major action was the highly successful <a href="Battle%20of%20Hamel">Battle of Hamel</a> on 4 July. The battalion was responsible for clearing <a href="Le%20Hamel%2C%20Somme">the village itself</a> and suffered 97 casualties. The 43rd played a supporting role in the first phase of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Amiens%20%281918%29">Battle of Amiens</a> on 8 August, which marked the beginning of the <a href="Hundred%20Days%20Offensive">Hundred Days Offensive</a> to drive the Germans back to the <a href="Hindenburg%20Line">Hindenburg Line</a> of fortifications. This included fighting west of <a href="Suzanne%2C%20Somme">Suzanne</a> on 25–26 August. On 2 September, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mont%20Saint-Quentin">Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin</a>, the 43rd Battalion was tasked with clearing trenches north of the village of <a href="Allaines">Allaines</a>. It captured Graz Trench opposite Allaines without a fight, then using <a href="hand%20grenade">hand grenade</a>s (known as bombs), fought northwards towards Scutari Trench, and succeeded in containing about 150 Germans at a fork in the trench. Faced with a deluge of German fire, a deadlock ensued, which was broken by Weathers, supported by three other men. His actions on that day resulted in a recommendation for the award of the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, the highest award for <a href="courage">gallantry</a> in battle that can be awarded to a member of the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian armed forces</a>. The citation read:

When Weathers returned to his comrades, his uniform was covered in mud, he had blood running down his face, and he had five days' stubble on his chin. He was also festooned "like a Christmas tree" with souvenired German binoculars and pistols. Full of nervous tension, he chattered to his mates about how he had "put the wind up" the Germans. During the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin, the 43rd Battalion suffered 67 casualties. Over the next week, the 11th Brigade was part of the pursuit of the Germans to the main Hindenburg Line. Weathers was promoted to temporary <a href="corporal%20%28rank%29">corporal</a> on 10 September. On 29 September, the 3rd Division was part of the <a href="Battle%20of%20St%20Quentin%20Canal">Battle of St Quentin Canal</a>, one of the last Australian ground actions of the war, which involved breaching the Beaurevoir Line, the third line of defences of the Hindenburg Line. During the battle, the 43rd Battalion was sheltering in a trench when a shell burst among a small group of men, wounding Weathers in the head. He died soon after, not knowing he would receive the Victoria Cross, which was gazetted on 24 December 1918. The same shell killed his uncle, Lance Corporal J. J. Weathers.

Weathers was buried at the <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Commonwealth War Graves Commission</a> Unicorn Cemetery, <a href="Vendhuile">Vendhuile</a>. , his Victoria Cross was in the hands of a private collector.

Stanford Memorial Church

Stanford Memorial Church (also referred to informally as MemChu) is located on the <a href="Main%20Quad%20%28Stanford%20University%29">Main Quad</a> at the center of the <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a> campus in <a href="Stanford%2C%20California">Stanford, California</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. It was built during the <a href="American%20Renaissance">American Renaissance</a> by <a href="Jane%20Stanford">Jane Stanford</a> as a memorial to her husband <a href="Leland%20Stanford">Leland</a>. Designed by architect <a href="Shepley%2C%20Rutan%20and%20Coolidge">Charles A. Coolidge</a>, a student of <a href="Henry%20Hobson%20Richardson">Henry Hobson Richardson</a>, the church has been called "the University's architectural crown jewel".

Designs for the church were submitted to Jane Stanford and the university trustees in 1898, and it was dedicated in 1903. The building is <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> in form and <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> in its details, inspired by churches in the region of <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, especially, <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a>. Its <a href="stained%20glass%20windows">stained glass windows</a> and extensive <a href="mosaics">mosaics</a> are based on religious paintings the Stanfords admired in Europe. The church has five <a href="pipe%20organs">pipe organs</a>, which allow musicians to produce many styles of organ music. Stanford Memorial Church has withstood two major earthquakes, in 1906 and 1989, and was extensively renovated after each.

Stanford Memorial Church was the earliest and has been "among the most prominent" <a href="non-denominational">non-denominational</a> churches on the West Coast of the United States. Since its dedication in 1903, the church's goal has been to serve the spiritual needs of the university in a non-sectarian way. The church's first chaplain, <a href="David%20Charles%20Gardner">David Charles Gardner</a>, began a tradition of leadership which has guided the development of Stanford University's spiritual, ethical, and academic relation to religion. The church's chaplains were instrumental in the founding of Stanford's <a href="religious%20studies">religious studies</a> department, moving Stanford from a "secular university" at the middle of the century to "the renaissance of faith and learning at Stanford" in the late 1960s, when the study of religion at the university focused on social and ethical issues like race and the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>.

Stanford Memorial Church is located at the center of Stanford University, and is "the principle building that is seen as the visitor approaches the University along Palm Drive from <a href="Palo%20Alto">Palo Alto</a>". It sits the middle of the long southern range of the school's <a href="Main%20Quad%20%28Stanford%20University%29">Main Quad</a>. The church was commissioned by <a href="Jane%20Stanford">Jane Stanford</a> (1828–1905) as a memorial to her husband, <a href="Leland%20Stanford">Leland Stanford</a> (1824–93). The Stanfords had intended that a church should become "the centerpiece of the university complex". They were deeply religious, and for their day and social standing, "open-minded ecumenicalists", so Jane Stanford was determined that a church built on campus be a "nondenominational—if essentially Protestant—house of worship". <a href="Robert%20C.%20Gregg">Robert C. Gregg</a>, who was chaplain of Memorial Church during the 1980s and 1990s, stated that the Stanfords had two objectives in building the church: to ensure that Stanford students had an opportunity to develop their ethics as well as their studies, and to provide comfort and strength to the community.

Leland Stanford died in 1893; legal disputes tied up the Stanford estate and prevented the completion of the university for several years. When the disputes were settled in Jane Stanford's favor, she was finally able to put into motion her wish for a church. In 1898, she and the university trustees requested design submissions for the church. In 1890, Jane Stanford visited her friend Maurizio Camerino in Venice, an artist with a reputation for producing high-quality mosaics; she and her husband had met him years earlier during one of their many trips to Europe. Stanford commissioned Camerino and his company, the <a href="Antonio%20Salviati">Antonio Salviati</a> studios, to produce mosaics for the church. Stanford was involved in every part of the church's design and construction. She was determined that the quality of the stonework of Memorial Church equal the medieval churches she admired in Europe. According to Memorial Church chaplain Robert C. Gregg, "The grandeur of the church, articulated in its details, greatly occupied Jane Stanford—the structure was to be without flaw".

Groundbreaking for the church took place in May 1899; construction began in January 1900. After a delay of almost a year, Stanford Memorial Church was dedicated on January 25, 1903, with "impressive ceremonies". Demonstrating Jane Stanford's goal of ecumenicism, Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger of San Francisco's <a href="Congregation%20Emanu-El%20%28San%20Francisco%2C%20California%29">Congregation Emanu-El</a> read the first Bible lesson. The church's pastor, Heber Newton, gave the sermon. A second service was held later that day, and D. Charles Gardner, the chaplain, gave the sermon. Stanford Memorial Church's first christening was held between the two services.

Jane Stanford once remarked: "While my whole heart is in the university, my soul is in that church". She died in 1905, and so did not live to see the damage caused by the <a href="1906%20San%20Francisco%20earthquake">1906 San Francisco earthquake</a>. Her funeral took place in the church, which was called one of her most important accomplishments and "the truest reflection of her visionary leadership", in March 1905. Clergy from several religious traditions, including a Rabbi, a Presbyterian minister, a Methodist minister, an Episcopal bishop, and a Baptist minister, officiated at the service.

Stanford Memorial Church has suffered two major earthquakes, in <a href="1906%20San%20Francisco%20earthquake">1906</a> and in <a href="1989%20Loma%20Prieta%20earthquake">1989</a>. Although extensively damaged, the church was restored after each. The 1906 quake wrecked much of the church, felled the spire, cracked the walls, and "injured beyond repair" the mosaics and <a href="Carrara%20marble">Carrara marble</a> statuary in the <a href="chancel">chancel</a>. The main cause of the severity of the damage was that the church's original construction failed to attach the crossing structure to the surrounding masonry and roof structures. When the earthquake hit the church, the crossing structure moved independently from the rest of the building, gouging gaping holes in the roofs over the east and west transepts, the nave, and chancel. Its original 12-sided, 80-foot spire and its adjoining clock tower fell on top of the chancel roof, destroying the tower dome's "frescoed Victorian interpretation of God's eye—complete with tear—surrounded by cherubs and shooting star". The debris hit and destroyed the marble sculptures of the <a href="Apostle%20%28Christian%29%23The%20twelve%20apostles">twelve apostles</a> that decorated the altar.

The spire was never repaired and the tower was removed and replaced by a simpler structure; however, the clock was saved and eventually placed in another building on campus, the <a href="Stanford%20Clock%20Tower">Stanford Clock Tower</a>. University trustees considered re-building the tower, and even looked at possible designs, but eventually chose not to rebuild it because they could not agree on its design, and chose instead to replace the tower with a domed skylight. The crossing structure also pushed the roof of the nave forward. The roof's weak connection to the church's front facade caused the facade to fall into the Inner Quad courtyard; as mosaic expert Joseph A. Taylor put it, "its wondrous mosaic was blown out and totally destroyed". The only mosaics not destroyed in the quake were the four angels that decorated the crossing. The back of the church, with several hundred feet of arcades, was also completely leveled because it too was not joined to the rest of the building.

Repairs of the earthquake damage began in 1908, despite misgivings from some university administration regarding its cost; it was closed between 1906 and 1913 while it was repaired. The university president had to postpone academic projects to pay for the church's restoration, as well as the restoration of the entire campus. Ultimately, they chose to repair Memorial Church because they recognized that it was "integral to the identity of the young university". The church and the Old Chemistry building were the only two buildings in the university's Inner Quad that were repaired. The extent of the damage was such that the church had to be completely rebuilt. The entire church, except for its surviving crossing structure and offices, was dismantled stone by stone, which, along with the windows, were labelled and stored, and were later relaid in their original positions. According to architecture historian Willis L. Hall in his 1917 book about the church, "In reconstruction great care has been taken to assure permanence". The stones were securely bolted to each other, "making the whole structure practically one massive hollow rock on a great steel foundation skeleton". The tile floor was replaced with cork. The building's crossing received a tiled hipped roof and an <a href="oculus">oculus</a>, which lit the interior of the church, and was added above the renovated dome, which had a frescoed ceiling decorated with bronze designs as opposed to the gold leaf present before the earthquake. The original rose window above the front facade was replaced with one with a simpler arch shape because it was more similar to the style of the rest of the buildings in the Inner Quad.
The dedication, which was engraved in large letters below the facade mosaic, was replaced by a smaller dedication plaque placed at the lower left of the facade, a choice the university alumni magazine called "a tremendous improvement". Camerino's design of the mosaics that were to fill in the empty space created by the removal of the original dedication, which he offered free of charge, were rejected in favor of a simple version created by John K. Branner (son of university president <a href="John%20Casper%20Branner">John Casper Branner</a>) in 1914. Camerino, who did not appraise the damage until 1913, restored the interior mosaics. He had saved the original drawings in Venice, so he removed and re-fabricated the <a href="chancel">chancel</a> mosaic, and redesigned the entire exterior mosaic. The Stanford alumni magazine, in early 1917, after the completion of the interior mosaics, declared the renovation complete, stating that "the church, for almost the first time since it was begun, is finished". Its appearance after the renovation was "significantly transformed".

In 1989 the church was damaged again, in the <a href="Loma%20Prieta%20earthquake">Loma Prieta earthquake</a>. Although the damage was not as serious as the '06 earthquake, it "spurred intricate strengthening and restoration work" to protect further damage from future earthquakes. The Stanford Quake ‘06 Centennial Alliance stated that the damage was not devastating, even though the building did not fulfill the more stringent earthquake codes in place in 1989, because of the previous renovation after the '06 earthquake. The Alliance also stated that if the earthquake had been stronger or lasted longer, the damage would have been more extensive. The integrity of the structure remained, but the crossing structure, the only major part of the building that was not dismantled and replaced after the 1906 earthquake, buckled and caused several stones in the north and west arches to slip as much as .

The four mosaic angels in the pendentives, which decorated its high rounded walls directly below the church's dome and served as the setting beds for hundreds of thousands of <a href="tessera">tessera</a>e, were severely damaged. Parts of the fallen mosaics were stolen, but later returned anonymously. The angels' damage caused large chunks of mortar and glass to fall to the floor eighty feet below , while other sections "were left hanging by the sheer geometry of their arched shape". An eight-foot mosaic section of an angel's left wing in the church's northeast corner fell to the floor. Several stones from the east arch wall fell onto pews in the balcony, and the organ-loft railing collapsed inward. Although the damage was minor, the church remained closed until 1992 while restoration, as well as a bracing project to protect the building from future earthquakes, without changing the building's decorations, was carried out. The university hired a team of contractors, structural engineers, architects, and conservation specialists to develop a renovation plan, which was paid for by a $10 million fundraising drive. Many donations came from undergraduates, and the university's board of trustees approved the plan before its funding was in place because they recognized the church's importance to Stanford.

In this restoration, the entire crossing was strengthened by bracing it behind the dome and securing it to the superstructure of the building. The restoration team evaluated every decoration in the church and made improvements and changes as necessary, in order to preserve the building's interior elements. They also discovered that the crossing's four large arches were hollow; they also found remnants of the steel frame that supported the original clock tower within a 20" void space in the church's arched walls. They had to fill the void with more than 470 tones of concrete and several layers of reinforcing steel in order to improve the walls' stability, an accomplishment the Alliance called "one of the most challenging retrofit feats implemented at Stanford".

The roofs, which had not been replaced since 1913, were rebuilt with plywood <a href="Diaphragm%20%28structural%20system%29">diaphragms</a>, 30,000 new red clay tiles were installed, and the stones from the decorative arches were reinserted. The wing of the damaged angel was restored; Stanford University hired William Kreysler and Associates to create a new backing system to secure this angel and three other mosaic angels to the base of the dome, which included replacing the original bonding materials (a weak lime mortar), with steel angles that anchored the mosaics to the walls and with a stronger polymer resin. The renovators found a piece of the original mosaic from the vestibule wall, which had a "<a href="Chi%20Rho">Chi Rho</a>" design, in the foundation, and inserted it into the Communion Table in the chancel, linking the current building with the pre-1906 church. The Victorian chandeliers were repaired and rewired, and the transept balconies, which had been closed for twenty years because they were declared unsafe, were reopened, after the false doors on the south side of each balcony were replaced by emergency exits and connected to existing staircases on the other side of the wall. A new sprinkler system and a new audio system was also installed. Stanford Memorial Church was rededicated by chaplain Robert C. Gregg on November 1, 1992.

According to Stanford professor <a href="Van%20Harvey">Van Harvey</a>, Stanford "had the reputation of being a completely secular university" before the 1950s, calling the period a "background of aggressive secularism and the almost complete neglect of the academic study of religion". In 1946, <a href="Merrimon%20Cuninggim">Merrimon Cuninggim</a>, a visiting chaplain at Stanford Memorial Church, criticized the serious lack of religious and spiritual resources available at Stanford for its students and criticized the university's lack of academic courses offered in the study of religions. Cuninggim insisted that the university's administration and trustees were responsible because they had interpreted the non-sectarian clause in Stanford's charter in "a negative and restrictive fashion rather than as enabling the tolerance and the flourishing of many religious faiths on campus".

Cuninggim also charged that Stanford's religious policies were inadequate compared to other prominent U.S. universities. Two attempts were made to found a <a href="seminary">seminary</a> to train pastors and religious leaders at Stanford, in 1921 and in 1940, but both failed. Harvey speculated that if Stanford had established a seminary like other prestigious universities, its <a href="religious%20studies">religious studies</a> department and the "ethos" of the entire institution would be different. In 1966, however, the university's Board of Trustees got a court order that allowed them to change the non-sectarian clause in Stanford's charter so that they could expand the university's religious program, which included permitting sectarian worship services at Stanford Memorial Church.
Stanford did not employ a full-time professor in religion until 1951 and did not establish a religious studies department until 1973, later than most other universities in the U.S. Earlier courses in religion were largely offered by the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church. David Charles Gardner offered a course in Biblical history and literature beginning in 1907, and by 1910, he was teaching <a href="New%20Testament%20Greek">New Testament Greek</a> and Bible classes. Gardner's successor, <a href="D.%20Elton%20Trueblood">D. Elton Trueblood</a>, whose goal was the establishment of a non-denominational graduate school in religious studies at Stanford, taught classes about the <a href="philosophy%20of%20religion">philosophy of religion</a>. In 1941 Trueblood's efforts to expand the study of religion resulted in the creation of a minor in religion, as well as twenty-one courses offered by him and four faculty members. By 1960, the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church no longer had to run the program, which had expanded to allow students the option of majoring in the study of religion. By the mid-1960s, the religious studies program at Stanford was enjoying "enormous success".

In the 1960s, the study of religion at Stanford began to focus more on social and ethical issues like race and the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. Leading this focus was Stanford Memorial Church Dean of the Chapel and Professor of Religion B. Davie Napier, who was "a powerful critic of U.S. policy in Vietnam". Napier, along with Stanford professors <a href="Michael%20Novak">Michael Novak</a> and <a href="Robert%20McAfee%20Brown">Robert McAfee Brown</a>, who had previously been faculty members of seminaries, were the subject of a "<a href="Time%20Magazine">Time Magazine</a>" article in 1966, describing "the renaissance of faith and learning at Stanford". Students crowded into the church to hear anti-war speeches by them, as well as by "notables" such as <a href="Linus%20Pauling">Linus Pauling</a> and <a href="William%20Sloan%20Coffin">William Sloan Coffin</a>. Harvey credited Napier for making the church a popular meeting place on campus for undergraduates and for turning it into "Christian theater—the introduction of jazz and other types of experimental worship as well as provocative preaching".

Stanford University was the first major educational institution in the United States that conducted same-sex <a href="commitment%20ceremonies">commitment ceremonies</a> at its chapel. Its first ceremony was held in 1993, and was officiated by Associate Dean <a href="Diana%20Akiyama">Diana Akiyama</a>. In 2017, a campus organization attempted to have Stanford Memorial Church declared a sanctuary church for the undocumented immigrant student population, but was unsuccessful due to university policies regarding the status of the church as part of the university.

Stanford Memorial Church, throughout its history, has been served by chaplains who have been influential amongst the Stanford University student body and community at large. <a href="R.%20Heber%20Newton">R. Heber Newton</a>, "distinguished writer" and former rector at <a href="Unitarian%20Church%20of%20All%20Souls">All Souls Church</a> in New York, was handpicked by Jane Stanford to serve as the church's first pastor; he resigned after four months in 1903 "because he disagreed with Mrs. Stanford on some aspects of church management". According to Stanford biographer Robert W. P. Cutler, "Newton's tenure had been a disappointment to Mrs. Stanford". <a href="David%20Charles%20Gardner">David Charles Gardner</a>, who replaced Newton, served the church from 1902 to his retirement in 1936. Stanford also handpicked Gardner as Newton's assistant because she was impressed with his "parish work" in Palo Alto. Gardner went on to teach courses in Biblical history and literature at Stanford. Influential English professor and Stanford historian <a href="Edith%20R.%20Mirrielees">Edith R. Mirrielees</a> called Gardner "a preacher of only indifferent ability", but considered him "a strength to the whole university". Mirrieless considered Gardner the prime mover behind the creation of the Stanford Home for Convalescent Children, established in 1919, which eventually became the <a href="Lucile%20Packard%20Children%27s%20Hospital">Lucile Packard Children's Hospital</a>.

<a href="D.%20Elton%20Trueblood">D. Elton Trueblood</a>, a lifelong <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a>, was the church's chaplain from 1936 to 1946. Trueblood was also a professor of philosophy of religion at Stanford and established the university's first major in religious studies; his tenure there provided him with "the public visibility and financial freedom that made a national ministry possible". He wrote 33 books, including one about <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. Trueblood and his wife hosted monthly Friends meetings in their home, and met weekly with <a href="Orthodox%20Jewish">Orthodox Jewish</a> students in the vestry of Stanford Memorial Church. George J. Hall was the church's chaplain from 1946 to 1947, followed by Paul C. Johnson, who served between 1949 and 1950. Robert M. Minto was chaplain twice, in 1947-1948, and again from 1950-1973. Minto, an associate chaplain at Stanford for two years prior, was a pastor in Scotland and a former British naval chaplain during World War II.

Stanford's next two chaplains, <a href="B.%20Davie%20Napier">B. Davie Napier</a> (Dean of the Chapel, 1966–72) and <a href="Robert%20McAfee%20Brown">Robert McAfee Brown</a> (Acting Dean of the Chapel, 1972–73), were among the most politically active chaplains. Napier was an ordained <a href="Congregational">Congregational</a> minister. He was born in China to missionary parents, grew up in the American South, and went to seminary at <a href="Yale">Yale</a>. He became known at Stanford "for his efforts to relate Scripture to the turbulent political times of the late 1960s". Napier was a "charismatic biblical scholar  ... [and] a powerful critic of U.S. policy in Vietnam". Napier was also a "gifted" preacher and jazz pianist. Brown, the author of 29 books, became "an international leader in civil rights, ecumenical and social justice causes". He also protested U.S. involvement in Vietnam and taught religion and ethics in relation to contemporary life and literature.

<a href="Robert%20Hamerton-Kelly">Robert Hamerton-Kelly</a> (1972–86), born in South Africa, was a United Methodist minister. He taught religion, classics, and Greek at Stanford. Thomas Ambrogi was acting dean for "a challenging year" in 1986. <a href="Robert%20Gregg%20%28priest%29">Robert C. Gregg</a> (1987–98) was born in Texas and ordained as an Episcopal priest. He was also Professor of Religious Studies. Kelly Denton-Borhaug (1999–2000), a <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> minister, came to Stanford in 1996 as an associate dean. The Rev. <a href="Scotty%20McLennan">Scotty McLennan</a> (2001-2014), a <a href="Unitarian%20Universalist">Unitarian Universalist</a> minister, was "an activist neighborhood lawyer" in Boston before becoming a university chaplain, first at <a href="Tufts%20University">Tufts University</a>. <a href="Garry%20Trudeau">Garry Trudeau</a>, who was McLennan's roommate when they were students at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>, based his <a href="Doonesbury">Doonesbury</a> character, the Rev. <a href="Scot%20Sloan">Scot Sloan</a>, in part on McLennan. He was replaced by the Very Rev. <a href="Jane%20Shaw">Jane Shaw</a>, an Episcopal priest and "a historian of modern religion", in the fall of 2014.

Stanford Memorial Church is run by the Stanford Office for Religious Life, headed by the current Dean for Religious Life, Tiffany Steinwert. She replaced the Very Rev. Prof. <a href="Jane%20Shaw">Jane Shaw</a> who was the dean for 4 years, 2014-18. Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neumann serves as Senior Associate Dean. Stanford has two associate deans: the Rev. Joanne Sanders and Sughra Ahmed.

Rabbi Karlin-Neumann is Stanford's first associate dean from outside the Christian tradition. Before coming to Stanford, Karlin-Neumann had been a director and chaplain at <a href="UCLA">UCLA</a>, <a href="Claremont%20College">Claremont College</a>, and Princeton, and was a rabbi in <a href="Alameda%2C%20California">Alameda, California</a>. She has taught courses in <a href="Jewish%20feminism">Jewish feminism</a>, rabbinical ethics, education, and <a href="social%20justice">social justice</a>. The university changed the title of her position to accommodate a Jewish rabbi, from "Associate Dean of Memorial Church" to "Associate Dean of Religious Life at Stanford". She calls her title at Stanford "Mem Chu and a Jew, too".

Joanne Sanders, an Episcopal priest, has worked at Stanford since 2000. She has degrees in theology, <a href="sports%20administration">sports administration</a> and <a href="physical%20education">physical education</a>. She "provides liturgical leadership for Memorial Church on campus for a variety of religious and other events".

<a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> dean Sughra Ahmed was appointed in 2017, for the purpose of, as Provost Persis Drell stated, to assist "the Stanford community develop a broader understanding of the Islamic faith, particularly at this time". She was named Muslim Woman of the Year in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in 2014, and is a recognized Muslim leader.

<a href="Robert%20Huw%20Morgan">Robert Huw Morgan</a>, a native of Wales, has been Stanford Memorial Church's organist since 1999. He attended <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a>, where he was an Organ Scholar and conducted their men and boys choir, and earned two doctorates at the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a> in Seattle, where he served on staff as a pianist and conductor. At Stanford, he serves as a lecturer in Organ, Director of the Stanford University Singers, and Director of the Memorial Church Choir.

Stanford Memorial Church is part of a linked, complex system of arcades that make up the Quad, which serves to unify the entire complex, is more reminiscent of European public spaces than American ones, and "is probably one of the most important feature of the original Stanford architecture". It was built during the <a href="American%20Renaissance">American Renaissance</a> period. Gregg called the church "a perfect example of the movement", with elements of the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, <a href="Byzantine%20art">Byzantine</a> and <a href="Medieval%20art">Medieval</a> art, the <a href="Romanesque%20art">Romanesque</a> period, and the <a href="Pre-Raphaelites">Pre-Raphaelites</a>. The architectural style of Stanford Memorial Church has been referred to as "a stunning example of late <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> <a href="ecclesiastical%20art">ecclesiastical art</a> and <a href="Victorian%20architecture">architecture</a> with echoes of <a href="Pre-Raphaelitism">Pre-Raphaelitism</a>". Stanford historian Richard Joncas called the church "an opulent example of high <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian architecture</a> with sumptuous materials and arts".

The original designs for Memorial Church and much of the university were made in 1886 by prominent American architect <a href="Henry%20Hobson%20Richardson">Henry Hobson Richardson</a>; when he died that same year, his student <a href="Shepley%2C%20Rutan%20and%20Coolidge">Charles A. Coolidge</a> completed them. Coolidge loosely based his design of Memorial Church on Richardson's design of <a href="Trinity%20Church%2C%20Boston">Trinity Church</a> in Boston. The church's heavy red tile roofs, round turrets, low arches, and rough-hewn stonework matches the design of other buildings in the Quad. After Jane Stanford's legal difficulties after her husband's death were resolved, she hired San Francisco architect <a href="Clinton%20E.%20Day">Clinton E. Day</a> to review and update the church's blueprints. <a href="Charles%20E.%20Hodges">Charles E. Hodges</a> was the supervising architect for the project. Jane Stanford hired builder <a href="John%20McGilvray">John McGilvray</a>, who was responsible for constructing the <a href="St.%20Francis%20Hotel">St. Francis Hotel</a>, the <a href="San%20Francisco%20City%20Hall">City Hall</a> complex in San Francisco, and much of Stanford University, for the actual construction of Stanford Memorial Church.
Jane Stanford's taste and knowledge of both contemporary and classical art is evident in several aspects of the plan, appearance, and architecture of the church, which "dazzle the eye yet also produce an atmosphere of quiet contemplation". According to Joncas, "the church emulates the 'glorious color' of the great European cathedrals", especially those in Italy. Although the <a href="iconography">iconography</a> in the church is Christian, Stanford was a "late Victorian progressive", and chose the art less for its religious themes and more for its "humanitarian ethics". She requested that the designs include women, "to show the uplifting influence of religion for women"; Architectural historian Willis L. Hall claims that there are more depictions of women than in most church imagery at the time. Art historian Judy Oberhausen reports that Stanford used <a href="compendium">compendium</a> of biblical illustrations like "" by Charles Foster, which contained 300 illustrations and summarized the events and stories she wished to depict in the church's windows and mosaics.

Jane Stanford's design included inspirational messages placed throughout the church in the form of inscriptions carved into its walls and enclosed in carved frameworks. As Barbara Palmer of the "Stanford Report" stated, Stanford "had her religious beliefs literally carved into the church's sandstone walls". For example, the following quotations can be found in the church's east transept:

Religion is intended as a comfort, a solace, a necessity to the soul's welfare; and whichever form of religion furnishes the greatest comfort, the greatest solace, it is the form which should be adopted be its name what it will.

The best form of religion is trust in God, and a firm belief in the immortality of the soul, life everlasting.

The church is a <a href="cruciform">cruciform</a> structure; its original structure, which included a clock and bell tower with an 80-foot (24 m) spire, was long and wide. The <a href="facade">facade</a> faces the Inner Quad, and is connected to other buildings by <a href="Arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcades</a> which extend laterally. The entry is through a <a href="narthex">narthex</a> or vestibule extending across the building. The <a href="nave">nave</a> has a single aisle on either side, separated by an arcade with a <a href="clerestory">clerestory</a> above it. The crossing is formed by a structure of square plan which once supported the central tower. Over it is a shallow dome supported on <a href="pendentive">pendentive</a>s and rising to a skylit oculus. High semicircular Romanesque arches separate the crossing from the nave, <a href="transept">transept</a>s and <a href="chancel">chancel</a>. The chancel and transepts are <a href="apse">apsidal</a>. There are deep galleries with concave <a href="Baluster">balustraded</a> fronts in the transepts and an organ gallery above the narthex. The sanctuary, in the chancel, is elevated and approached by steps. A round-shaped room is at the back of the building, added in 1902 by architect Clinton Day.

The chief building material of the church is buff <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, which came from the Goodrich Quarry (also called the Greystone Quarry) in the Almaden area of San Jose, was delivered by train and rough-cut in the university Quad. Gregg credits the high quality of the stonework to church and university builder John D. McGilvray. The church is roofed with terracotta tiles of the Italian <a href="imbrex%20and%20tegula">imbrex and tegula</a> form. The nave, chancel, and transepts appear to project from the square central structure, roofed with tiles and a small skylight above its center. Memorial Church originally had a central bell tower with an 80-foot tall, twelve-sided spire, but this was lost as a result of the 1906 earthquake.

The church's <a href="facade">facade</a> is surmounted by a simple <a href="Celtic%20cross">Celtic cross</a>, a motif that appears several times throughout the building. The cross was added after the 1906 earthquake; its central shaft was destroyed in the Loma Prieta earthquake and replaced. There are three arched entrances below the exterior mosaic; the central one is slightly larger than the others. The surrounding stonework is intricately carved with stylized flora, twisted-cable moldings, and bosses of sculpted cherubim, a motif which occurs in different media throughout the church. In the spandrels are mosaic depictions of the biblical concepts of love, faith, hope and charity intertwined in a vine representing the "<a href="tree%20of%20life">tree of life</a>".

In the upper zone of the facade, surrounded by more elaborate stonework and "lacy carving", is a large central window, with groups of three smaller windows on each side. The original central window was a quatrefoil-shaped <a href="rose%20window">rose window</a>, but after the 1906 earthquake, it was replaced by a "classical round-head window that more grandly restates the smaller flanking, articulated openings" and that corresponded with the <a href="Mission%20Revival%20Style%20architecture">mission-style architecture</a> of the Quad. Beneath the windows are inlaid panels of colored marble.

The gable and surrounding surfaces contain the church's largest mosaic, created by Maurizio Camerino's studio, which they rebuilt after the 1906 earthquake. Measuring wide at the base and in height, at the time of its completion, it was the largest mosaic in the U.S. It depicts a group of men, women and children, 47 in all, surrounding and "paying close heed" to Christ, the mosaic's central figure, and includes a landscape with "waving palms and a gleaming sky" behind Christ. The exterior mosaic took 12 men two years to complete.

After Jane Stanford's death, the mosaic popularly gained the name "<a href="The%20Sermon%20on%20the%20Mount">The Sermon on the Mount</a>", although Stanford University historian Richard Joncas insists that the mosaic does not depict the scene as described in the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> and has referred to it as "an indefinite biblical scene". In the Stanford University press release about the 1992 gift of three watercolor studies for the church's mosaics, Paoletti's design for the facade is described as ""Christ Welcoming the Righteous into the Kingdom of God"", based on Matthew 25:34. Paoletti created another unfinished watercolor depicting "<a href="The%20Last%20Judgment">The Last Judgment</a>", as another option for the facade mosaic, but it was evidently rejected by Stanford.

Jane Stanford has been described as having a "Victorian aversion to blank space" and so created a church that is "a dimly lit cavern of glowing mosaic surfaces ... and vibrant, stained-glass windows". The church is richly decorated throughout, its architectural features carved with formalized foliate ornament, and the walls adorned with mosaics in the Byzantine manner. Even though the church was dedicated in 1903, interior decoration took another two years to complete, with the installation of the mosaics and the carving of the extensive quotations on the walls occurring simultaneously. There are 29 large carvings of <a href="quatrefoils">quatrefoils</a> that contain ancient religious symbols in the walls of church's west and east transepts. The stained-glass windows were crafted by <a href="J%26amp%3BR%20Lamb%20Studios">J. and R. Lamb</a> of New York. Its exposed-timber ceilings are modeled after Boston's Trinity Church.

The church is entered through three bronze doors adorned with angels, a recurring motif throughout the church. The doors open up into a <a href="narthex">narthex</a> or <a href="Vestibule%20%28architecture%29">vestibule</a> decorated with mosaics on the walls, illuminated by the many colors of the stained glass windows, and stone carvings on the architectural details. There is a variety of styles and motifs reflecting the hands of different craftsmen. The mosaic that adorns the floor depicts the <a href="Lamb%20of%20God">Lamb of God</a> surrounded by the symbols of the <a href="Four%20evangelists">four gospel writers</a>: <a href="Matthew%20the%20Evangelist">St. Matthew</a> (the winged angel), <a href="Mark%20the%20Evangelist">St. Mark</a> (the winged lion), <a href="Luke%20the%20Evangelist">St. Luke</a> (the ox), and <a href="John%20the%20Apostle">St. John</a> (the eagle). Some of these symbols also appear in other areas of the church. A Celtic cross adorns the stained glass above the central wooden door that leads into the nave, and Latin epigraphs have been engraved above the two side doors.

Above the <a href="narthex">narthex</a> is an organ gallery. The nave is <a href="Arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcaded</a> and has a single aisle on each side with clerestory windows above. Its walls, from the floor to the top of the clerestory, are decorated with 15 murals made of mosaics on each side, and depicts scenes from the Old Testament. The exposed timber ceiling was inspired by Trinity Church and is constructed with tied <a href="Hammer%20beam%20roof">hammer beams</a>, which can be seen radiating in the chancel. The floor of the church slopes downward towards the crossing. The chancel and transepts are three semi-circular apses. They are separated from the broad central space by large semi-circular arches on stout columns with carved capitals. The transept apses each have a balcony with a concave balustrade.

Directly above the crossing is a <a href="dome">dome</a> supported on pendentives. Around the base of the dome are decorative gilt bands, the lower depicting a scrolling vine. Jane Stanford intended the dome's decoration of to be of mosaic tiles showing a variety of symbols, but the church's builders thought it would make the dome too heavy, so the decorations were painted. On the <a href="spandrels">spandrels</a> of the pendentives are mosaics of four angels measuring from wing tip to wing tip, rising from clouds. The angels survived the 1906 earthquake, but the angel looking downward was severely damaged during the 1989 earthquake because an 8-foot section of its left wing fell .

The <a href="chancel">chancel</a>, according to Hall, contains "artistic work of a kind seldom seen anywhere". The raised tiled floor of the chancel curves outward into the body of the church, and is approached by seven marble steps. The <a href="sanctuary">sanctuary</a> is raised further, and enclosed by a marble altar rail behind which is an altar carved from white Carrara <a href="marble">marble</a> by <a href="L.M.%20Avenali">L.M. Avenali</a>. The altar supports a "simple unadorned brass cross that reflects the colors of the mosaics surrounding it." The cross was made by <a href="William%20van%20Erp">William van Erp</a> and was dedicated to the memory of Jane Stanford in 1948.
Behind the altar is a mosaic reproduction of Roselli's "Last Supper". Around the lower walls of the chancel are twelve niches decorated with golden mosaic tiles. They hold candles, but originally held statues of the twelve apostles, destroyed in 1906 and were never replaced. According to local legend, the cherubim carved in stone above the golden niches and in the pillars' capitals are illustrations of children living on campus at the time of the church's construction. To the west side of the chancel stands brass lectern in the form of a reading angel, which Jane Stanford brought from Europe and dedicated to her husband on the anniversary of his birth in 1902.

Three stained glass windows in the apse depict the <a href="Nativity%20of%20Jesus">nativity</a>, <a href="crucifixion">crucifixion</a>, and <a href="Ascension%20of%20Jesus">ascension</a> of Christ. The mosaics between them show angels, those on the left carrying a cross, those on the right carrying a crown. On the longer sections of the chancel wall, on either side of the windows, are mosaics depicting a choir of angels. Above them is a tier of mosaics with representations of the prophets and kings of Israel. Other mosaics abound in the transepts, clerestory, and the choir loft at the northern end of the church. A series of mosaics in the upper transepts depict Old Testament figures on the east side and Christian saints on the west side. On Jane Stanford's direction, they alternate male and female.

The arches, balcony rails, and pillars throughout the church have relief carvings created by a team of 10 men who worked for two years from <a href="scaffolding">scaffolding</a>. A large double pillar before the entrance of the west transept have inscriptions dedicated to members of the Stanford family. After the 1989 earthquake, a third of the west transept was converted into a small chapel. The altar and chairs in this chapel were designed by Bay Area artist <a href="Gail%20Fredell">Gail Fredell</a> who decorated the chapel's altar by using Salvatti's original mosaics, which had been stored since the church's reconstruction following the 1906 earthquake.

According to architectural historian Willis L. Hall, the church's 20 large <a href="stained%20glass%20windows">stained glass windows</a> "are as much a feature of the church as the mosaics". The windows, designed by Frederick Stymetz Lamb (1863–1928) and fabricated by J&R Lamb Studios, his father's firm in New York City, took three years to complete, and eight months to install at Stanford. Jane Stanford hired Lamb because she felt he was more interested in "the ecclesiastical rather than commercial aspect of the work". The installation of the windows at Stanford Memorial Church was the largest commission awarded to an American stained glass artist at the time, and the project is "considered the finest example of Lamb's work". The window have a different appearance when viewed from the outside of the building because the reflected light highlights the textures of the glass panels, created by using many layers of different colored glass.

Stanford chose the life of Christ for the windows' theme, inspired by the religious paintings by European master painters such as <a href="Frederic%20Shields">Frederic Shields</a> and <a href="Gustave%20Dor%C3%A9">Gustave Doré</a>. The windows have a section at the bottom with the scriptural quotations their images depict; the larger windows also include their titles. Stanford's personal touch is shown in one of the <a href="nave">nave</a> windows, which is based on a cartoon by Paoletti and depicts Christ welcoming the soul of a child into Heaven before the eyes of its grieving mother, an allusion to the death of <a href="Leland%20Stanford%2C%20Jr.">Leland Stanford, Jr.</a>, the Stanfords' only child and the university's namesake, who died in 1884 of <a href="typhoid">typhoid</a> shortly before his 16th birthday.

Oberhausen, who has studied the source of the mosaics and windows, states that at least four stained glass windows were inspired by the paintings of Pre-Raphaelite artists that were enjoying a resurgence in popularity at the time. These windows are: "Christ in the Temple" in the east transept, based upon a painting by <a href="William%20Holman%20Hunt">William Holman Hunt</a>; "The Annunciation" in the east nave, inspired by a work by <a href="Frederic%20Shields">Frederic Shields</a>; "The Nativity" in the chancel, based upon a painting by <a href="Edward%20Fellowes-Prynne">Edward Fellowes-Prynne</a>; and "The Good Shepherd" in the west transept, inspired by a painting by Sibyl C. Parker, the only female artist represented in the artwork of the church. None of the windows of Stanford Memorial Church required replacement after the 1906 quake, except for "the famous rose window of the original structure" in the organ loft which was replaced by the current large, central arch window. This window, entitled "Lilies of the Field", is the only window in the church that cannot be viewed from the inside because it is blocked off by the central organ. There is a cross in the center of this window made of "faceted pieces of glass that are inset like gems", which sparkle when light strikes it.

The church's clerestory contains many smaller windows of individuals from the Bible or Christian history. The windows in the nave above the east arcade depict the following Old Testament figures: <a href="Abraham">Abraham</a>, <a href="Hagar%20%28Bible%29">Hagar</a> and her child <a href="Ishmael">Ishmael</a>, <a href="Moses">Moses</a>, <a href="Bithiah">Pharaoh's Daughter</a>, <a href="Joshua">Joshua</a>, and <a href="Deborah">Deborah</a>. The windows in the east transept depict <a href="David">David</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Ruth">Ruth</a>, <a href="Solomon">Solomon</a>, <a href="The%20Queen%20of%20Sheba">The Queen of Sheba</a>, <a href="Elijah">Elijah</a>, <a href="Esther">Esther</a>, <a href="Isaiah">Isaiah</a>, <a href="Judith">Judith</a>, <a href="Daniel%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Daniel</a>, and <a href="Hannah%20%28Bible%29">Hannah</a>. In the nave above the west arcade feature saints and virtues: <a href="Saint%20Stephen">Stephen</a>, <a href="Agnes%20of%20Rome">Agnes</a>, <a href="Saint%20Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="Priscilla%20and%20Aquila">Priscilla</a>, <a href="John%20the%20Apostle">John</a>, and <a href="Hope">Hope</a>. In the west transept are <a href="Simeon%20%28Gospel%20of%20Luke%29">Simeon</a>, <a href="Saint%20Anne">Anne</a>, <a href="Matthew%20the%20Evangelist">Matthew</a>, <a href="Faith">Faith</a>, <a href="Mark%20the%20Evangelist">Mark</a>, <a href="Charity%20%28virtue%29">Charity</a>, <a href="Luke%20the%20Evangelist">Luke</a>, <a href="Dorcas">Dorcas</a>, <a href="Saint%20Paul">Paul</a>, and <a href="Martha%20of%20Bethany">Martha</a>. The clerestory above the east and west doors are two windows of angels. Unlike the other windows throughout the church, they do not receive natural light from outside and are artificially illuminated instead.

The mosaics that decorate Stanford Memorial Church, which Taylor considers "a perfect complement to <a href="Frederick%20Lamb">Frederick Lamb's</a> stained-glass windows", are "virtually everywhere" inside the church. According to Gregg, Jane Stanford came up with the idea, calling it "idiosyncratic by some architectural historians", of extensively decorating Memorial Church's interior and facade, similar in style to the mosaics in many of the churches she and her husband admired during their travels in Europe. One of the reasons she chose mosaics was because of the similar weather in Italy and Northern California, where the moderate climates and rainy seasons in both settings protect the images from erosion and clear the pollution that accumulates on many buildings in large cities. As Hall states, the "mosaics on the facade are always clear and brilliant." During the Stanfords' 1883 tour of Europe, they visited <a href="Byzantine%20architecture">Byzantine churches</a> in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> and <a href="St%20Mark%27s%20Basilica">St Mark's Basilica</a> in Venice. They met and befriended Maurizio Camerino, the manager of the <a href="Antonio%20Salviati">Antonio Salviati</a> studios, which had just completed restoring the mosaics at St Mark's.

Stanford began working with Camerino, who by that time had bought the Salviati studios, in 1899, and spent two months in Venice in the fall of 1900, selecting the watercolors created as the mosaics' patterns by Camerino's chief designer, Antonio Paoletti. Camerino's firm worked exclusively on the Stanford mosaics for three years; the project, which included the mosaics created for <a href="Iris%20%26amp%3B%20B.%20Gerald%20Cantor%20Center%20for%20Visual%20Arts">the university museum</a>, was the largest mosaic project in the U.S. at the time. Stanford worked closely with Paoletti, planning a combination of Old Testament and New Testament scenes that represented men and women equally.

The mosaic project began in 1900, took five years to complete, and cost US$97,000. The "shimmering quality" of the mosaics, which resemble <a href="tapestry">tapestry</a>, were created by different tones of green and gold; the artists that installed them had over 20,000 shades of colors to choose from. Paoletti's watercolors were divided into two-foot-square sections, which were made into glass by other artists in Venice. The mosaics were then shipped in pieces by boat to New York and then by railroad to California, where they were placed on the church's walls. Artisan <a href="Lorenzo%20Zampato">Lorenzo Zampato</a> was given the task of supervising the in-studio fabrication and <a href="Mosaics%23Indirect%20method">final installation</a> at Stanford, which took 4 years to complete.

The mosaic adorning the church's <a href="chancel">chancel</a> is a reproduction of <a href="Cosimo%20Roselli">Roselli's</a> <a href="fresco">fresco</a> of the <a href="Last%20Supper">Last Supper</a> from the <a href="Sistine%20Chapel">Sistine Chapel</a> in the <a href="Apostolic%20Palace">Vatican</a>. Camerino obtained permission from <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a> to reproduce it at Stanford Memorial Church. Unlike other works, which were reproduced frequently, it was the only reproduction of Roselli's fresco at the time. There are 12 mosaics in each transept balcony that are split into two sets of six, creating an arc of six mosaics, ten windows, and six mosaics. Most of the church's mosaics were made from 1/8-inch tiles; larger 3/4-inch tiles were used on the higher mosaics, and smaller 1/4-inch tiles were used in "The Last Supper" mosaic.
Stanford Memorial Church houses five <a href="pipe%20organ">organs</a>, a "situation only a few places in the nation can boast". The presence of high-quality organs makes Stanford an ideal location for accomplished musicians, and the sanctuary one of California's best settings for instrumental and choral performance. The church's <a href="organist">organist</a> is <a href="Robert%20Huw%20Morgan">Robert Huw Morgan</a>.

Stanford Memorial Church's first organ, the 1901 Murray Harris, named for its builder <a href="Murray%20M.%20Harris">Murray M. Harris</a>, sits in the upstairs galley and is still in use. Damaged in the 1906 earthquake, the organ was rebuilt in 1925, enlarged in 1933, and thoroughly restored in 1996. It features three <a href="Manual%20%28music%29">manuals</a> (keyboards for the hands), 57 stops, and over 3,700 pipes. The Murray Harris plays music from the Romantic period; its sound has been described as "romantic [and] undulating" and "like a low-decibel airplane engine revving up" Morgan compares the Murray Harris to both a Rolls Royce and a Bentley.

The Fisk-Nanney organ, which many consider one of the best organs in the world, was built in 1985 and is also housed in the church's upstairs galley. It is named after its builder, <a href="Charles%20Fisk">C. B. Fisk</a>, and for Herbert Nanney, who was the church's organist for 39 years. Although it was commissioned in 1973, its completion was delayed for many years, due to logistical, financial, and construction issues. The organ's case is made of poplar wood and its almost 4,500 pipes are made of varying sizes of lead and tin. Its keyboards, which Morgan calls the "flight deck," are made with <a href="grenadilla">grenadilla</a>, with <a href="rosewood">rosewood</a> making up its natural and sharps, and are capped with bone. The organ's keyboards are black on white, instead of the modern white on black. The <a href="Organ%20stop">stop controls</a> create "a huge array of sounds".

The Fisk-Nanney is a four-manual Baroque-type organ with 73 ranks. It uses a "combination of elements from historic East German, North German, and French organs plus dual <a href="Musical%20temperament">temperaments</a>", and is "the first instrument in the history of organ building that is capable of reproducing nearly all organ music written from the 16th through the 18th centuries". The organ, which "has remarkable complexity", features both French- and German-style <a href="Reed%20pipe">reeds</a> and <a href="Flue%20pipe">principal choruses</a>. It is equipped with a Brustpositiv division in <a href="meantone%20temperament">meantone temperament</a>. A lever allows the remaining divisions to alternate between <a href="well%20temperament">well temperament</a> and meantone temperament, a feature made possible by the inclusion of five extra pipes (two for each sharp key) per <a href="octave">octave</a>.

Morgan describes the organ's sound as "delicious" and "visceral", ringing with "'incredible clarity' and 'dark color'", and compares it to driving a Maserati. He insists that the best place to listen to the Fisk-Nanny is not upstairs in the galley where it sits, but in the church, "about halfway down the nave". In 2005 Morgan performed the complete organ works of <a href="Dieterich%20Buxtehude">Dieterich Buxtehude</a> during a series of recitals, eight hours in all, to celebrate the organ's 20th anniversary. During the 2009–2010 school year, Morgan commemorated the 25th anniversary of the Fisk-Nanney organ and his 10th year at Stanford in a concert series of the complete organ works of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a>, which took 18 hours to complete.

Memorial Church's third organ, the Katherine Potter-Brinegar organ, was built in 1995 and was named for the spouse of Stanford alumni <a href="Claude%20S.%20Brinegar">Claude S. Brinegar</a>. It "further enhances" the diversity of the organs in Stanford Memorial Church, and was inspired by a famous chamber organ designed by German organ maker Esias Compenius in 1610. It is self-contained, with its blower and bellows encased in its walnut case, and has hidden, retractable wheels that allow it to moved anywhere in the church. It is a single-manual organ; most of its pipework is made of different types of wood, and has 8 speaking stops, 3 of which are made of reed pipes. Its sound has been described as "relaxed and refined to the listener".

The <a href="continuo%20organ">continuo organ</a> built by <a href="Pasi%20Organ%20Builders">Martin Pasi</a> of <a href="Roy%2C%20Washington">Roy, Washington</a> was acquired in June 2001. It contains three stops. The case and most of its pipes are made of <a href="walnut">walnut</a>, and its keys are made of <a href="ebony">ebony</a> and English <a href="boxwood%20%28genus%29">boxwood</a>.

In 2010 the church received on long-term loan a five-rank <a href="Tudor%20period">Tudor</a>-style organ built by Hupalo & Repasky Pipe Organs. It is a recreation based upon the work of English organ builders and restorers <a href="Goetze%20and%20Gwynn">Martin Goetze and Dominic Gwynn</a> and of the discovery in 1995 of the upper boards, grid, and table of a rare English organ, one of only three out of the five organs of the type in existence. It is a "small but tonally versatile" organ typical of the Tudor era of the 16th century.

The Tudor organ's 200 pipes are made from metals with high tin content, and its façade pipes have been gilded and embossed. Its case, which was inspired by organ cases in churches in Wales and <a href="Stanford-on-Avon">Stanford-on-Avon</a>, is made of stained white oak, with hand-carved panels of linen fold and <a href="Tudor%20rose">Tudor rose</a> (inspired by the Tudor rose on Shrewsbury Tower at <a href="St%20John%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">St. Johns College</a> in Cambridge) carvings. The Tudor's keys are made of European pear wood; its sharps are made of ebony. It has two large feeder bellows that supply the organ's wind. The organ's sound is "surprisingly full and has a singing bell-like quality".

Although the Stanfords were religious and viewed "spiritual and moral values as essential to a young person's education and future citizenship", they were not formally committed to any Christian denomination. As a result, Jane Stanford decreed, from the beginning of Stanford Memorial Church's history, that the church be non-denominational. She believed that adopting this philosophy would "serve the broadest spiritual needs of the university community". The church's first chaplain, Charles Gardner, declared on the day of its dedication that the church's goal was to serve the spiritual needs of the university in a non-sectarian way. The Stanfords' goal was that moral instruction would occur at the church, as demonstrated in the inscriptions carved into its walls, which was influenced by the late 19th-century liberal Protestantism they embraced. As former Stanford chaplain Robert C. Gregg states, "The Stanfords sought to protect free intellectual inquiry—in classroom, laboratory, and church—from any interference prompted by the caution or dogmatism of religious authorities".

Stanford Memorial Church was the earliest and has been "among the most prominent" <a href="non-denominational">non-denominational</a> churches on the West Coast of the United States. Multi-faith services are held at Stanford Memorial Church, in addition to denominational and non-denominational Christian services. As many as 150 weddings or renewal ceremonies take place in the church each year, for current and former students and their children or grandchildren, for Stanford faculty and staff members, and for others connected to the university. Memorial services, conducted by Stanford's dean and other chaplain officials, for students, alumni, faculty, and staff are also conducted at the church.

Members of the university community use Memorial Church for "quiet, for reflection, and for private devotions". Catholic masses are held in the church several times a week. <a href="Offertory">Offertories</a> at the principal Sunday services are donated to local charitable organizations.

Populous: The Beginning

Populous: The Beginning is a <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> and is the third entry in the <a href="Populous%20%28series%29">"Populous"</a> video game series, developed by <a href="Bullfrog%20Productions">Bullfrog Productions</a>. The game was released in 1998 on <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, and in 1999 for the <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a>. Unlike earlier games in the series, which cast the player in the role of a god influencing loyal followers, "The Beginning" took a radical departure and placed the player in the role of a <a href="shamanism">shaman</a>, who directly leads her tribe against opponents. Throughout the twenty-five missions of the campaign, the player leads their tribe across a <a href="solar%20system">solar system</a>, dominating enemy tribes and tapping new sources of <a href="magic%20%28fantasy%29">magic</a>, with the ultimate goal of the shaman attaining godhood herself.

"Populous: The Beginning" was the first entry in the series to use <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D computer graphics</a>; Bullfrog waited four years after "" so that the graphics technology could catch up to their vision for a new and different game in the series. The developers considered the addition of terrain deformation and manipulation, combined with "smart" villagers who automatically attended to tasks, to add an entirely new dimension to the series. The game's original title was "Populous: The Third Coming" before being changed prior to the <a href="beta%20release">beta release</a>.

"Populous: The Beginning" plays very differently from earlier titles and received mixed reviews. Critics noted the excellent graphics, while complaints were directed at the <a href="artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">artificial intelligence</a> and the indecision in game design between being a <a href="real%20time%20strategy">real time strategy</a> title and a god game. "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>"s Peter Olafson wrote that "Populous: The Beginning" was a good game but was "without a quintessential quality that defined "Populous"."

In "Populous: The Beginning", the player controls a female shaman and the tribe which follows her. Unlike the previous games in the series, "The Beginning" allows the player to directly control the action of followers, by ordering them to build structures or attack enemies. In the campaign, the player must fight the opposing Dakini, Chumara and Matak tribes for dominion over the <a href="solar%20system">solar system</a>. Enemy tribes also have shamans, and on later levels all inhabit the same world. While the objective is almost always to eliminate all of the members of the other tribes, there are often specific ways this can be achieved. Sometimes the player must use magic spells gained from worship at special monuments such as stone heads or "Vaults of Knowledge"; in other cases, the player only needs to overwhelm the enemies with superior numbers. The game has no formal <a href="resource%20management">resource management</a>; new units are created automatically at houses, and training new troops costs nothing except <a href="magic%20%28gaming%29">mana</a>. Only wood from trees is required to build new structures.

The game is played from a <a href="third-person%20%28video%20games%29">third-person</a> perspective with the camera at a variable height and capable of rotating 360°, enabling the player to quickly move across the planet's terrain. While the terrain's topology is a <a href="torus">torus</a>, the map is locally projected onto a sphere to give the illusion of a planet. On maps where there is no <a href="fog%20of%20war">fog of war</a>, players can see what opponents are doing at any time. Extensive support for 3D acceleration enables the player to view the game in 16-bit or 32-bit colour. The landscape and real-time structure building and follower movement are also shown.

The player commands different types of followers, each of which has advantages and disadvantages in combat. The most basic unit is the Brave, which builds huts, towers, and military buildings. Braves are trained to become other units: tough melee Warriors; weak, long-range, Firewarriors; Preachers, who convert enemy units and prevent enemy preachers from converting friendly troops; and Spies, who perform espionage functions. Shamans are physically weaker than warriors, but can cast powerful spells and can be reincarnated if killed. Some spells will disappear after use. Other spells can slowly be replenished for continued use; the rate of spell regeneration depends upon the player's number of followers. Examples of spells include "Landbridge", which raises the sea floor to create bridges across the sea; "Swarm", which sends a horde of insects to sow confusion in enemy ranks; and "Tornado", which creates a cyclone to destroy buildings. There are twenty-six spells in total, which are slowly learned throughout the campaign.

"Populous: The Beginning" supports multiplayer, either by <a href="modem">modem</a> connection (limited to two players), <a href="IPX">IPX</a>, or over the <a href="Internet">Internet</a> through an external matchmaking service. "Populous: The Beginning" allows for a maximum game size of four players playing against each other.

"Populous: The Beginning" does not take place on Earth. Rather, the game takes place in a <a href="planetary%20system">planetary system</a> of twenty-five unnamed planets before the events of the previous titles; however, the universe within the game is seemingly unconnected with reality. While many of the planets are predominantly <a href="grassland">grassland</a>s dotted with trees, other worlds feature wildly different terrains, such as a volcanic world and a planet almost entirely covered by water. These worlds are inhabited by four human tribes, represented by their color: the green "Matak", the yellow "Chumara", and the red "Dakini". The fourth blue tribe, controlled by the player, is never officially mentioned by name. Each of the tribes is generally hostile to one another, though alliances exist on some worlds. The reasoning for the hostilities is never explained other than the starting cutscene stating that the other (non-player) tribes "would destroy us". While all the tribes are ruled by a single female shaman, no other females are seen in the game, except in <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s; all the followers recruited in the game are male. In addition to the organized tribes are 'wildmen', neutral characters who cluster in groups around trees and water. Though they cannot attack or be attacked, players can use the Shaman's Convert spell to bring wildmen under her tribe's control.

"Populous: The Beginning" takes place before the first two games in the series. The player controls the Blue tribe, pitted against the three enemy tribes which control most of the solar system. The player's destiny as Shaman is to become a deity; only by defeating all the enemies in the system can the player's shaman become <a href="omnipotence">omnipotent</a>. The player begins on the planet furthest from the sun, and attacks each planet in sequence. Along the way, the Shaman can learn new skills and magic to defeat her (usually) much more powerful enemies. Victory requires the player to either destroy the opposition, or on occasion perform special actions. The player loses if his or her Shaman is killed and there are no remaining followers, if the Shaman is killed and there is no circle of reincarnation, or the player runs out of time on timed levels. Upon beating back the other tribes, the Shaman ascends to <a href="Divinity">godhood</a>, and further helps her people conquer the Matak, Chumara and Dakini in one final conflict.

"Populous: The Beginning" was the first in the series developed with entirely <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D graphics</a>, allowing the environment to be scaled and rotated in real time. The game was published more than four years after "" with developers stating the delay was due to waiting for the hardware specifications to come along enough that they would allow them to do something very different and new. Producer Stuart Whyte said of the work, "We're really proud of what we've done in software because it does look really nice."

The "Populous" series inspired the term "<a href="god%20game">god game</a>", with players assuming the role of an omniscient being who lead his people to new territories or into battle. Alan Wright, the game's project leader, stressed both the departure "Populous: The Beginning" took from previous titles in the series, as well as distinguishing itself from similar games like "<a href="Command%20%26amp%3B%20Conquer">Command & Conquer</a>". The elements of smart villagers and terrain-reforming, he said, "adds a whole level of gameplay not found in those titles." Bullfrog representative Brian Allen asserted that these departures distinguished "Populous: The Beginning" from other real-time strategy games on the market at the time. In some aspects, the developers were forced to remove features due to technical constraints; for example, the "Plague" spell from previous "Populous" titles was dropped because in practice the spell was too frustrating.

Originally, the game was known as "Populous: The Third Coming", but the name was changed by the time the game was shown in a fully playable beta form in late 1998. The game was the first in the series to be made without "Populous" creator <a href="Peter%20Molyneux">Peter Molyneux</a>, who had left Bullfrog to create <a href="Lionhead%20Studios">Lionhead Studios</a>. The music was composed by <a href="Mark%20Knight%20%28musician%29">Mark Knight</a>, who had joined Bullfrog's team in 1997.

Bullfrog released the "Populous: The Beginning — Undiscovered Worlds" in 1999. The expansion was only made available in the UK and US. The add-on offered twelve new single-player and twelve multiplayer levels, with a continuation of the storyline begun in the previous game, where the player takes on the role of a new shaman who must restore peace to the solar system.

"Populous: The Beginning" received generally favorable reviews on release with some strong criticisms to follow. <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Ward Trent was especially smitten with the immersive 3D graphics. "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" stated, "previous Bullfrog games have always placed gameplay above graphical finesse, but that's no longer the case." <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a><nowiki>'</nowiki>s reviewer Ron Dulin appreciated how "The Beginning" was a daring revamp of the series, instead of a safe, slightly modified sequel (like the earlier ""). "Computer and Video Games" rated "The Beginning" as a "better play" than the original.

Complaints about the game centered on the difficulty of controlling followers, the simplicity of gameplay, and the tension between game styles. The game's <a href="artificial%20intelligence">AI</a> allowed followers to automatically construct buildings, but this led to problems directing them in the midst of a hectic battle. IGN noted that with the player's followers automatically going about daily life, the replay value was lowered even with the multiplayer options. Others agreed that the automation rendered gameplay too simple, with no upgrades or serious resource management, a sentiment "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" expressed when they wrote that the missions "become mind-numbingly repetitive".

"Populous: The Beginning" played very differently from earlier titles. "Edge" concluded that while the more rigid play format of "The Beginning" was new to the series, it had the effect of making the end result "less show-stopping"; "Edge" believed that the game was caught between the <a href="god%20game">god game</a> and <a href="Real-time%20strategy">RTS</a> genres, and did not excel at either. PCGamer subsequently decided the game failed to live up to the previous games in the series. More charitably, "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>"s Peter Olafson wrote: ""Populous: The Beginning" is not a bad game, in fact a good one; but it's a different game—one without a quintessential quality that defined "Populous"."

Edgar Towner

Edgar Thomas Towner, <a href="Victoria%20Cross">VC</a>, <a href="Military%20Cross">MC</a> (19 April 1890 – 18 August 1972) was an <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20Victoria%20Cross%20recipients">Australian recipient</a> of the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, the highest decoration for gallantry "in the face of the enemy" that can be awarded to members of the British and <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> armed forces. A <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, Towner was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 1 September 1918, during an attack on <a href="Mont%20St.%20Quentin">Mont St. Quentin</a> on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>.

Born in Queensland to a farming family, Towner enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in 1915. Posted to the transport section of the 25th Battalion, he served in Egypt until his unit was sent to the Western Front. He then transferred to the <a href="2nd%20Machine%20Gun%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2nd Machine Gun Battalion</a> where he was <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commissioned</a> as a lieutenant and twice <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> for his leadership. During June 1918, Towner led a machine gun section in attack near <a href="Morlancourt">Morlancourt</a> and assisted the infantry in reaching its objectives under heavy fire, for which he was awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a>. In September, again commanding a machine gun section, he was involved in the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied</a> counteroffensive that broke the German lines at Mont St. Quentin and <a href="P%C3%A9ronne%2C%20Somme">Péronne</a>. Fighting for thirty hours after being wounded, his "conspicuous bravery, initiative and devotion to duty" earned him the Victoria Cross, which was presented by <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George V</a> in April 1919.

Discharged in August, Towner returned to Australia. He was appointed a director of the Russleigh Pastoral Company, and briefly re-enlisted during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, when he was promoted to <a href="major">major</a>. A keen geographer, he was awarded the Dr Thomson Foundation Gold Medal in 1956 for his geographical work. Unmarried, he died in 1972 at the age of 82.

Edgar Towner was born on 19 April 1890, at Glencoe Station near <a href="Blackall%2C%20Queensland">Blackall, Queensland</a>, to Edgar Thomas Towner, a grazing farmer, and his Irish wife Greta (née Herley). He was educated at Blackall State School and in <a href="Rockhampton%2C%20Queensland">Rockhampton</a>, although he also received private instruction from his mother. After leaving school Towner worked on his father's grazing property until 1912, when he acquired land of his own. He named the property "Valparaiso" and worked on its development until the outbreak of the First World War.

On 4 January 1915, Towner enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. Assigned to the transport section of the <a href="25th/49th%20Battalion%2C%20Royal%20Queensland%20Regiment">25th Battalion</a> as a <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a>, he embarked aboard HMAT "Aeneas" from <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> on 29 June, bound for Egypt. The troopship arrived in August, and the battalion spent the rest of the month training in the desert before transferring to the <a href="Gallipoli%20Peninsula">Gallipoli Peninsula</a>. Towner, however, remained in Egypt with the army's transportation elements.

Following the <a href="Allies%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Allied</a> evacuation of Gallipoli, the 25th Battalion returned to Egypt in December 1915, where Towner rejoined its ranks on 10 January 1916. He was promoted to <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a> on 1 February, before departing with the battalion at <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> the following month to join the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> on the Western Front. Disembarking at <a href="Marseilles">Marseilles</a>, the unit was the first Australian battalion to arrive in France.

In July 1916, the 25th Battalion took part in its first major Western Front action at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pozi%C3%A8res">Battle of Pozières</a>, part of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Somme offensive</a>. The battalion suffered 785 casualties between 25 July and 7 August. It was briefly transferred to a "quieter sector of the front in Belgium" before returning to action on the Somme in October. On 3 November, Towner was transferred to the <a href="Australian%20Machine%20Gun%20Corps">Australian Machine Gun Corps</a> and was assigned to the <a href="2nd%20Machine%20Gun%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2nd Machine Gun Battalion</a> of the <a href="2nd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">2nd Australian Division</a>, and was allotted to the <a href="7th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">7th Brigade</a>'s Machine Gun Company. He was commissioned as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> fifteen days later, and assumed command of the battalion's transport section.

Promoted to <a href="First%20Lieutenant">lieutenant</a> on 24 February 1917, Towner's service with his transport section earned him praise for his "devotion to duty and consistent good work", and on 9 April he was <a href="Mentioned%20in%20Despatches">Mentioned in the Despatches</a> of <a href="Field%20Marshal">Field Marshal</a> <a href="Douglas%20Haig%2C%201st%20Earl%20Haig">Sir Douglas Haig</a>. Towner was granted leave to the United Kingdom in January 1918. He received a second Mention in Despatches on 7 April 1918, the notification of which was published in a supplement to the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 28 May.

On the night of 10/11 June 1918, Towner was in command of a machine gun section during an attack to the south of <a href="Morlancourt">Morlancourt</a>. One of the first to reach the objective, he deployed his section and got its guns into action "very quickly". By using captured German machine guns he was able to increase his section's fire and provide support to the company on his right as it advanced, seized, and consolidated its position. During the morning of 11 June, one of the posts held by the Australian infantry was blown in by German artillery; braving machine gun and sniper fire, Towner went out in daylight to help reorganise the post. Cited for his "cheerful and untiring attitude" and for "set[ing] a conspicuous example", Towner was awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> for his actions. The announcement of the award and accompanying citation was published in a supplement to the "London Gazette" on 24 September 1918.

On 1 September 1918, Towner was in command of No. 3 Section of the 7th Machine Gun Company during an attack on <a href="Battle%20of%20Mont%20St.%20Quentin">Mont St. Quentin</a>, near <a href="P%C3%A9ronne%2C%20Somme">Péronne</a>. Armed with four <a href="Vickers%20machine%20gun">Vickers machine gun</a>s, the section was attached to the right flank of the 24th Australian Infantry Battalion, whose principal objective was to seize the summit of Mont St. Quentin. To accomplish this, the battalion would have to advance through the village of Feuillaucourt before moving down to the Péronne road. The Australians began their advance at 06:00 behind an artillery screen, with Towner's section covering a front of . Visibility was limited by rain, and Australian casualties soon began to mount. Locating a German machine gun that was causing heavy losses among the advancing troops, Towner rushed the position and single-handedly killed the crew with his revolver. Having captured the gun, he then turned it on the Germans.

Once Feuillaucourt had fallen, the 24th Battalion continued to the Péronne road. However, the Germans had occupied a <a href="copse">copse</a> of trees and put up strong resistance, halting the advance. German troops were observed massing for a counter-attack, so Towner moved forward with several of his men, two Vickers guns, and the captured German gun, and brought the assembling Germans under concentrated fire, inflicting many casualties. Attempting to retire, a party of twenty-five German soldiers were cut off by Towner's guns and taken <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoner</a>. Under heavy incoming fire, Towner then scouted over open terrain to locate advantageous positions from which his guns could offer further support. When he moved his section forward, the machine gunners were able to engage more groups of German soldiers; their aggressive action enabled the advance to be renewed, and the battalion attained the cover of a sunken section of the Péronne road. However, on rejoining them Towner found that his section was growing short of ammunition, so he made his way back across the fire-swept ground and located a German machine gun, which he brought forward along with several boxes of ammunition. This he brought into action "in full view of the enemy"; his effective fire forced the Germans to retire further, and allowed one of the stalled Australian flanks to push ahead.

German machine gunners had occupied a commanding vantage overlooking the sunken road, and began to rain down heavy fire around Towner's position. One of the bullets struck his helmet, inflicting a gaping wound to his scalp. Refusing to be evacuated for medical treatment, Towner continued firing his gun as the German pressure increased and the situation grew critical. Eventually the Australian infantry were forced to retire a short distance, but with all its crew having become casualties, one gun was left behind. Alone, Towner dashed out over <a href="no%20man%27s%20land">no man's land</a> and retrieved the weapon. With this gun he "continued to engage the enemy whenever they appeared", putting a German machine gun out of action with his accurate fire.

Throughout the night, Towner frequented the front lines and "continued to fight and ... inspire his men". He provided supporting fire for the 21st Australian Infantry Battalion as they assaulted a heavily fortified crater on Mont St. Quentin's summit, and repeatedly reconnoitred the German position to reported on troop movements. The next morning his section assisted in repulsing a large German counterattack before Towner was finally evacuated with exhaustion—thirty hours after being wounded. Initially admitted to the 41st Casualty Clearing Station, he was transported by train to the 2nd <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> Hospital at <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a>. For his actions during the battle, Towner was awarded the Victoria Cross—the third of six Australians to receive the medal during the fighting around Mont St. Quentin and Péronne.

The full citation for Towner's Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the "London Gazette" on 14 December 1918, reading:

Following his recuperation, Towner was granted three weeks leave to England from 14 September 1918. He rejoined his unit on 12 October and, for six days, was attached to the School of Instruction. Following thirteen days leave in France during late November, he returned again to the 2nd Machine Gun Battalion on 12 December.

On 10 April 1919, Towner attended an investiture ceremony in the ballroom of <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>, during which he was decorated with his Victoria Cross and Military Cross by <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George V</a>. Three weeks later he boarded HT "Karagola", bound for Australia. Disembarking at <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> on 14 June 1919 he made his way to Brisbane, and was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 16 August 1919.

Towner resettled on his property, but was forced to sell Valparaiso in 1922 after he was unable to raise sufficient funds to purchase livestock. He spent the next three years working as a <a href="Jackaroo%20%28trainee%29">jackaroo</a>, until he entered into a partnership on Kaloola station, a property located near <a href="Longreach%2C%20Queensland">Longreach</a>, in 1925. Towner eventually bought out his partner and assumed another partnership with the Russleigh Pastoral Company, <a href="Isisford%2C%20Queensland">Isisford</a>. He was later appointed a director of the company.

With the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> looming, Towner enlisted in the <a href="Citizens%20Military%20Force">Citizens Military Force</a> on 8 August 1939 and was appointed a <a href="Captain%20%28land%29">captain</a> to the <a href="26th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">26th Battalion</a>. After a period as a company commander he was promoted to temporary <a href="major">major</a> and second-in-command of the battalion, under fellow Victoria Cross recipient Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Harry%20Murray">Harry Murray</a>. However, Towner retired from the army due to ill health on 21 February 1942, and returned to his property at Kaloola.

A keen <a href="geographer">geographer</a>, Towner would often disappear into the <a href="The%20Bush%23Australia">bush</a> for weeks on end, for study or exploration. As a fellow of the <a href="Royal%20Geographical%20Society">Royal Geographical Society</a> of Australia and member of the Royal Historical Society of New South Wales, he took a particular interest in researching the life of the explorer <a href="Thomas%20Mitchell%20%28explorer%29">Sir Thomas Mitchell</a>. In 1946, he successfully lobbied the <a href="Australian%20Government">Australian Government</a> to issue a <a href="postage%20stamp">postage stamp</a> commemorating the centenary of Mitchell's discoveries in central Queensland. He addressed the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia in Brisbane in 1955, and was awarded the Dr Thomson Foundation Gold Medal for his geographical work the following year. Towner's address was published in 1957, in a booklet entitled "Lake Eyre and its Tributaries".

Towner never married, and on 18 August 1972 died at Longreach Base Hospital at the age of 82. His funeral took place three days later, with a large number of Longreach citizens lining the streets to see his coffin pass by atop a gun carriage. Following a service at St Andrew's Church, he was buried with full military honours at the Longreach Town Cemetery. By the time of his death, Towner had amassed an farm containing 25,000 sheep. He remains the highest-decorated serviceman from Queensland. On 24 April 2009, a statue of Towner crafted by <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> sculptor William Eicholtz was unveiled in his birth town of Blackall. Inspired by an essay written by a local schoolboy, the community raised <a href="Australian%20dollar">A$</a>80,000 to commission a monument in Towner's memory.

Arbiter (Halo)

In the "<a href="Halo%20%28series%29">Halo</a>" science fiction universe, the Arbiter is a ceremonial, religious, and political rank bestowed upon alien <a href="Elites%20%28Halo%29">Covenant Elites</a>. In the 2004 video game "<a href="Halo%202">Halo 2</a>", the rank is given to a disgraced commander as a way to atone for his failures. Although the Arbiter is intended to die serving the Covenant leadership, the <a href="High%20Prophets%20%28Halo%29">High Prophets</a>, he survives his missions and the Prophets' subsequent betrayal of his kind. When he learns that the Prophets' plans would doom all sentient life in the galaxy to extinction, the Arbiter allies with the Covenant's enemies—humanity—and stops the ringworld <a href="Halo%20%28megastructure%29">Halo</a> from being activated. The Arbiter is a <a href="player%20character">playable character</a> in "Halo 2" and its 2007 sequel "<a href="Halo%203">Halo 3</a>"; a different Arbiter appears in the 2009 <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> game "<a href="Halo%20Wars">Halo Wars</a>", which takes place 20 years before the events of the main trilogy.

The appearance of the Arbiter in "Halo 2" and the change in perspective from the main human protagonist <a href="Master%20Chief%20%28Halo%29">Master Chief</a> to a former enemy was a plot twist "Halo" developer <a href="Bungie">Bungie</a> kept highly secret. The character's name was changed from "<a href="Dervish">Dervish</a>" after concerns that the name reinforced a perceived United States-versus-<a href="Islam">Islam</a> allegory in the game's plot. Actor <a href="Keith%20David">Keith David</a> lends his voice to the character in "Halo 2", "3" and "5", while <a href="David%20Sobolov">David Sobolov</a> voices the Arbiter of "Halo Wars".

The Arbiter has appeared in four series of action figures and other collectibles and marketing in addition to appearances in the games. Bungie intended the sudden point of view switch to a member of the Covenant as a plot twist that no one would have seen coming, but the character in particular and the humanization of the Covenant in general was not evenly received by critics and fans. "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" derided the Arbiter's missions as "crap bits" in "Halo 2". Conversely, <a href="IGN">IGN</a> lamented the loss of the Arbiter's story in "Halo 3" and missed the added dimension the character provided to the story.

The Arbiter in the video games "<a href="Halo%202">Halo 2</a>" (2004) and "<a href="Halo%203">Halo 3</a>" (2007) is voiced by American actor <a href="Keith%20David">Keith David</a>. David noted that he enjoys voicing complicated characters who have a past. To make an impact with voice acting, he says, is difficult—"it's either good acting or it's bad acting". David is not a frequent video game player, but stated that he has become more known for his work as the Arbiter than for his film and other voice roles.

The Arbiter changed very little during development, as the overall appearance of the alien Covenant Elites had been designed and developed for the previous game, 2001's "". The only substantial difference between the Arbiter and other Elites is ceremonial armor seen in early concept sketches and which appeared in the final design. During "Halo 2"s early developmental stages the character's name was "<a href="Dervish">Dervish</a>", a name from the Sufi sect of <a href="Islam">Islam</a>. Out of context, <a href="Microsoft%20Studios">Microsoft Game Studios</a>' "geocultural review" consultants found nothing wrong with the name. However, as Tom Edwards, a consultant who worked with Microsoft during the review noted, "within the game's context this Islamic-related name of 'Dervish' set up a potentially problematic allegory related to "Halo 2"s plot—the [United States]-like forces (<a href="Master%20Chief%20%28Halo%29">Master Chief</a>/<a href="Sergeant%20Johnson">Sarge</a>) versus Islam (the religious Covenant, which already had a '<a href="Prophet%20of%20Truth">Prophet of Truth</a>' which is one title for <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>). Since this incident was not long after the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>, sensitivity to the name remained high, and the character's name was changed to the "Arbiter".

In an interview with <a href="MTV">MTV</a>, "Halo" developer <a href="Bungie">Bungie</a>'s former content manager Frank O'Connor said that the inclusion of the Arbiter as a playable character in "Halo 2" was supposed to be a "secret on the scale of a <a href="M.%20Night%20Shyamalan">Shyamalan</a> plot twist" and explains that Bungie was able to keep the public uninformed about this until the game's release, to the point that O'Connor never even considered including it on the weekly development updates posted at Bungie's webpage. O'Connor also stated that Bungie "had some other things that were secrets within secrets" and claimed that there was material related to the Arbiter that was kept secret during the development of "Halo 3" because "There is an aspect of the Arbiter's character that is still secret to this day and will remain so for a good reason." Story director <a href="Joseph%20Staten">Joseph Staten</a> said that the purpose of introducing the Arbiter was "to offer another, compelling point of view on a war where telling friend from foe wasn't always clear-cut. We knew we had a trilogy on our hands, so we were looking past the shock of playing as the enemy [to the events of "Halo 3"]".

Presented in "Halo 2", the rank of "Arbiter" is bestowed upon a Covenant Elite by the Covenant leadership—the <a href="High%20Prophets%20%28Halo%29">High Prophets</a>—during a time of "extraordinary crisis". The Arbiter acts as the "Will of the Prophets", undertaking highly dangerous missions to preserve the Covenant. It is expected that these soldiers will die in the course of their duties. Although it was originally a rank of great honor, it later became a rank assigned to disgraced or shamed Elites that nevertheless possessed great martial skill, both as a means to have them serve the Covenant, and as a convenient means of disposal after their assigned suicidal missions.

The Arbiter in the "Halo" saga Thel 'Vadamee, was previously a Supreme Commander in the Covenant fleet, having commanded the ships that follow the human vessel "Pillar of Autumn" to the ringworld <a href="Installation%2004">Halo</a> during the events of "Halo: Combat Evolved". A Prophet orders the "Autumn" not to be destroyed outright, lest the ring be damaged; this hesitance allows the humans to land on the ring, coordinate a resistance, and ultimately destroy the ring to stop the spread of the parasitic <a href="Flood%20%28Halo%29">Flood</a>. In the aftermath of the incident (depicted in ""), the commander also loses a Covenant ship to UNSC forces, resulting in the annihilation of a Covenant invasion force heading for Earth. As "Halo 2" begins, the Covenant High Council brands the Commander a heretic for letting the ringworld—which the Covenant consider a sacred relic—be destroyed. He is stripped of his rank and branded. Though his public execution is soon to follow, he is spared by the High Prophets; the Hierarchs give the disgraced Commander a chance to lead troops once again by becoming the Arbiter.

The Arbiter's first mission is to silence a renegade Elite who has been preaching that the Prophets have lied to the Covenant. The Arbiter is then sent to retrieve the "Sacred Icon" from the library on the newly discovered <a href="Installation%2005">Delta Halo</a>, in order to activate the ring and bring about the Great Journey, the Covenant's concept of salvation. Though he retrieves the Icon, the Arbiter is betrayed by the Chieftain of the <a href="Covenant%20%28Halo%29">Brutes</a>, <a href="Tartarus%20%28Halo%29">Tartarus</a>; Tartarus reveals that the Prophets have given him and his race "carte blanche" to massacre the Elites and replace them in the Covenant caste system. Though the Arbiter is believed dead, he is rescued—along with his nemesis, the human soldier Master Chief—by the parasitic Flood intelligence <a href="Gravemind">Gravemind</a>. Gravemind reveals that the Great Journey actually spells doom for all sentient life, and sends him to stop Tartarus from activating the ring. In the process of stopping the Brute, the Arbiter and his Elites forge an alliance with the humans <a href="Miranda%20Keyes">Miranda Keyes</a> and <a href="Sergeant%20Johnson">Avery Johnson</a>, and the Arbiter slays Tartarus with help from Johnson, halting the firing of the ring. The unexpected shutdown of Halo triggers a standby sequence, which the Arbiter learns has made all the Halo installations ready to fire remotely from a place known as <a href="The%20Ark%20%28Halo%29">the Ark</a>.

While the Arbiter remains a playable character in "Halo 3" during <a href="cooperative%20gameplay">cooperative gameplay</a> (the second player in a game lobby controls him), the game's story never switches to the point of view of the Arbiter, as in "Halo 2". For much of "Halo 3", the Arbiter assists human forces in their fight against hostile Covenant forces alongside John-117. After the Flood arrive on Earth, the Arbiter persuades <a href="Rtas%20%27Vadumee">Rtas 'Vadum</a> not to glass the entire planet to quell the infestation. Along with a group of humans and Elites, the Arbiter follows the Prophet of Truth's forces through a slipspace portal to the Ark, where he kills the Prophet. The Master Chief decides to activate the Halo under construction at the Ark to destroy the local Flood while sparing the galaxy at large; the Arbiter helps to retrieve the artificial intelligence <a href="Cortana%20%28Halo%29">Cortana</a> so that the installation can be fired. During the escape, the ship he and the Master Chief are on split in two; while the Master Chief is presumed lost, the Arbiter crashes safely to Earth. After attending a ceremony honoring the dead, the Arbiter and the rest of the Elites leave for their homeworld.

Taking place 20 years before the events of "Halo: Combat Evolved", Ensemble Studio's "<a href="Halo%20Wars">Halo Wars</a>" features a different Arbiter from the character seen in the trilogy. Lead designer David Pottinger described Ensemble's Arbiter as a "mean guy. He's <a href="Darth%20Vader">Darth Vader</a> times ten." The characterization stemmed from a desire to make the Covenant more basically "evil" in order to provide a good guy-bad guy conflict. Parts of the Arbiter's backstory before the game's events are explained in a tie-in graphic novel, "Halo Wars: Genesis". The Elite, Ripa 'Moramee, was given the rank after he fought and lost a campaign against his own clan. The Arbiter acts as the primary enemy of the game, charged with the destruction of humanity by the Prophet of Regret. Under the Prophet's orders, the Arbiter kidnaps Professor Ellen Anders and takes her to a Forerunner shield world in uncharted space where he uses Anders to activate a massive fleet of Forerunner dreadnoughts with the plan to use the fleet to destroy humanity. The Arbiter engages in combat with protagonist Sergeant John Forge twice: once when the Arbiter kidnaps Anders and once when Forge attempts to use the "Spirit of Fire's" FTL reactor to destroy the shield world. Both times the Arbiter proves to be more than a match for Forge. The first time, the Arbiter spares Forge's life after Anders agrees to go with him quietly in exchange. The second time, Forge tricks the Arbiter before stabbing him in the neck with his combat knife "Lucy". Forge is then able to kill the Arbiter with his own energy sword.

Thel 'Vadam, voiced by Keith David, narrates and appears in a trailer for "", first shown at the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%202014">Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014</a>. The trailer acts as a prelude to "", in which Thel 'Vadam and his forces (Swords of Sangheilios) are locked in a bloody civil war with rogue Sangheili-led splinter factions that reside on the home planet Sanghelios . During the game, the Arbiter meets with Spartan Jameson Locke who asks the Arbiter about whether the nickname "Demon" was an insult or a compliment. The Arbiter assures it was an insult, but with a certain standard of respect, which, after a chain of events, eventually lead the Arbiter to call the Master Chief an ally and even his friend. Before the Spartans leave, the Arbiter asks Locke what the Spartans nicknamed the Master Chief, given that he was neither ally nor foe to them. The scene ends with Locke dodging the question and restating his duty. The Arbiter appears as an ally in the game, fighting the reformed Covenant forces of Jul 'Mdama, even after 'Mdama's death at the hands of Locke. The Arbiter is ultimately successful in defeating his enemies and is reunited with the Master Chief at the end of the game following Cortana's betrayal.

An Arbiter is available as a playable character in "<a href="Killer%20Instinct%20%282013%20video%20game%29">Killer Instinct: Season Three</a>", voiced by <a href="Ray%20Chase%20%28voice%20actor%29">Ray Chase</a>. He uses several weapons from the "Halo" series in combat, and fights in the Arena of Judgment, a stage set in the midst of a battle on Sanghelios . According to franchise development director Frank O'Connor, this character is an "amalgam" of historical characters.

Thel 'Vadam appears in several of the Halo novels starting with "The Cole Protocol". In the novel, taking place around fifteen years before the games, he is the commander of a Covenant ship that comes into conflict with Captain Jacob Keyes and a group of Spartans over a colony of human survivors in an asteroid belt. Thel gets caught up in the political machinations between the Prophets of Regret and Truth and is left with doubts after what he witnesses, ending with Thel being forced to kill his best friend to protect the Prophets. His identity as the Arbiter is hinted at during the end of the novel when he comments that he is being given command of a ship within the Fleet of Particular Justice, the fleet that the Arbiter commanded before the events of "Halo 2". Thel appears in several other novels taking place after "Halo 3" where he strives for peace with humanity while dealing with dissent within his own species and the other Covenant remnants.

Following the release of "Halo 2", Joyride Studios released an Arbiter action figure. This particular model was reviewed by Armchair Empire's Aaron Simmer as a "great translation of the source material into plastic". Simmer described the figure's dimensions were in proportion with other figures released by the studio, and praised the level of detail in the armor and weapons, but found fault with the neck articulation and design. Other aspects mentioned were its compatibility with the Master Chief's action figure and its durability. Several models of the Arbiter are featured in the Halo ActionClix collectible game, produced as promotional material prior to the release of "Halo 3". <a href="McFarlane%20Toys">McFarlane Toys</a> was given the task of developing a "Halo 3" line of action figures, and a sculpt of the Arbiter was released in the second series of figures after the game's release in July 2008. A large-scale, non-articulated Arbiter figure was produced by McFarlane as part of the "Legendary Collection".

The reception of the Arbiter as a playable character in "Halo 2" was mixed; O'Connor described the Arbiter as the most controversial character Bungie had ever created. The character was described as a "brilliant stroke of a game design" because it provided an unexpected story line but also offered the player new options by allowing stealth gameplay. Several publications enjoyed the added dimension to the Covenant by having the Arbiter as a playable character.

Alternatively, publications like <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> thought that while the Arbiter and Covenant side added "newfound complexity to the story", it distracted the player from Earth's fate; a panel of "Halo 2" reviewers argued that though the decision to humanize the Covenant by the introduction of the Arbiter was welcome, the execution in-game was lacking. The missions where the player controls the Arbiter were described as "anything but easy" and occasionally "boring", due to the lack of human weapons to balance the gameplay. A review performed by "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" described the time that the player controls the character as "[those] crap bits when you play as an alien Arbiter" and listed this as one of "Halo 2"s flaws. Reviewer Jarno Kokko said that while he did not personally dislike playing as the character, the idea of "people disliking the concept of playing on the other side in a game that is supposed to be the 'Master Chief blows up some alien scum' show" was a plausible complaint. Among some fans, the character was reviled.

The reception of the Arbiter's elimination as a main playable character in "Halo 3" was similarly mixed. Hilary Goldstein of IGN decided the change took away the "intriguing side-story of the Arbiter and his Elites", in the process reducing the character's role to that of "a dude with a weird mandible and a cool sword". Likewise, Steve West of Cinemablend.com stated that the one important event in the game for the Arbiter would be lost on anyone for whom "Halo 3" was their first game in the series. IGN's reviewer took issue with the poor artificial intelligence (AI) of allies in the game, and singled out the Arbiter in particular; "The Arbiter makes me question why the Elites were ever feared in the original "Halo"," Hilary Goldstein said. Describing the AI of the character, Goldstein felt players could "enjoy watching your supposed equal getting shot in the face repeatedly and generally making himself utterly useless. What is the point of sticking you with an AI compatriot if all he's good at is respawning?" "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" Charles Herold found that in comparison to "Halo 2", where the character played a central role, the Arbiter in "Halo 3" was "extraneous". On the opposite end of the spectrum were reviewers like <a href="G4tv.com">G4tv</a>, who argued that the Arbiter was more likeable, not to mention more useful, as an AI sidekick instead of the main player. In a list of the top alien characters in video games, <a href="MSNBC">MSNBC</a> placed the Arbiter at the number two ranking.

"Halo Wars"s cinematics and voice acting were widely lauded, although one reviewer wrote that the characters were stereotypical and unlikeable. Dakota Grabowski of PlanetXbox360 considered the Arbiter the most confusing character in the game's story. Conversely, <a href="GamePro">GamePro</a> listed the Arbiter as one of the five best things about the game, saying that while it was a different character than the Arbiter seen in "Halo 2" and "Halo 3", he was "like an alien <a href="Jack%20Bauer">Jack Bauer</a> amped up on drugs".

Despite the resistance to the character, Bungie staff defended the character's introduction. "I'd much rather experiment and do something surprising, and not have everybody appreciate it, than just turn the crank and do another alien war movie with a space marine," said "Halo 2" design lead Jaime Griesemer. Community lead Brian Jarrard attributed some of the fan backlash to a discord between the game's marketing and the actual gameplay. "I think, even more so than playing as the Arbiter, the thing that people were disappointed with and angry about is that they were promised this experience, through the marketing, of being really backs against the wall, Earth's under siege, we're going to do all we can to save our home planet... In reality, the game only had two missions that actually did that." Referring to "Halo 2"s cliffhanger ending, Griesemer said, "I think if we'd been able to finish that last couple of missions and get you properly back on Earth, a lot of the reaction would have been placated."

Alfred Shout

Alfred John Shout, <a href="Victoria%20Cross">VC</a>, <a href="Military%20Cross">MC</a> (8 August 1882 – 11 August 1915) was a New Zealand-born soldier and an <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20Victoria%20Cross%20recipients">Australian recipient</a> of the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> (VC), the highest decoration for gallantry "in the face of the enemy" awarded to members of the British and <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> armed forces. Shout was posthumously awarded the VC for his actions at <a href="Battle%20of%20Lone%20Pine">Lone Pine</a> in August 1915, during the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a> of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. After <a href="Military%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman forces</a> had counterattacked and seized a large stretch of the Australians' front line, Shout gathered a small party of men and charged down one trench throwing <a href="Grenade">bombs</a>. He killed eight Turkish soldiers, and managed to clear others to retake the trench. In a similar action later that day, and supported by another officer, he recaptured further ground amid hard fighting. In the final push forward, Shout simultaneously lit three bombs to lob at the enemy. He successfully threw two, but the third burst just as it was leaving his hand. Shout was grievously wounded, and died two days later.

Born in <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a>, Shout had served in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a> as a teenager. He rose to <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a> and was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> for saving a wounded man before being discharged in 1902. He remained in South Africa for the next five years, serving as an artilleryman in the <a href="Cape%20Colonial%20Forces">Cape Colonial Forces</a> from 1903. With his Australian-born wife and their daughter, Shout immigrated to <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> in 1907. The family settled in <a href="Darlington%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Darlington</a>, where Shout worked for <a href="Resch%27s">Resch's</a> Brewery as a <a href="Carpentry">carpenter</a> and <a href="joiner">joiner</a>. He was also active in the part-time <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Citizens' Forces</a>, being <a href="Commissioned%20officer">commissioned</a> just prior to the outbreak of the First World War. In August 1914, he joined in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) for active service overseas and was appointed a <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in the <a href="1st%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">1st Battalion</a>. After training in Egypt, he took part in the <a href="Landing%20at%20Anzac%20Cove">Anzac landings at Gallipoli</a> on 25 April 1915. For his leadership during the invasion and its immediate aftermath, Shout was awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> and later mentioned in despatches. Shout's three gallantry awards at Gallipoli made him the most highly decorated member of the AIF for the campaign.

Alfred John Shout was born in <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a>, New Zealand, on 8 August 1882. He was the eldest of nine children to an English-born father, John Richard Shout, and Irish mother, Agnes Mary (née Kelly, formerly McGovern). Information on Alfred Shout's early life is rather scant and the details differ between sources, but according to his <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> attestation form he was privately educated. In early 1900, Shout travelled to South Africa with his elder half-brother, William McGovern. The brothers sought to join one of the colonial contingents then engaged in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>; Alfred enlisted in the newly raised Border Horse on 17 February 1900, while William (using the surname Shout) found a place in <a href="Edward%20Cecil%20Bethune">Bethune's</a> Mounted Infantry. The Border Horse was an irregular colonial force formed in eastern <a href="Cape%20Colony">Cape Colony</a>, and Shout was allotted to the unit's No. 1 Company with the service number 9216.

Serving at Wittebergen, <a href="South%20African%20Republic">Transvaal</a>, and in the Cape Colony with the Border Horse, Shout was twice wounded, including once in the chest. In an action at Thabaksberg on 29 January 1901, the then <a href="Lance%20Corporal">Lance Corporal</a> Shout assisted in maintaining the position of his men. At one point during the engagement, he ventured out under heavy rifle fire to retrieve a wounded man, and brought him back to a covered position; Shout's bravery in this action earned him a <a href="mention%20in%20despatches">mention in despatches</a>. He was promoted to <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a> on 7 May 1901, and discharged from the Border Horse 16 days later. He then served with the Stellenbosch District Mounted Troop until 1902. Shout was issued the <a href="Queen%27s%20South%20Africa%20Medal">Queen's South Africa Medal</a> with "Wittebergen", "Transvaal" and "Cape Colony" clasps, and the <a href="King%27s%20South%20Africa%20Medal">King's South Africa Medal</a> with the clasps "South Africa 1901" and "South Africa 1902" for his service in the Boer War.

Shout decided to remain in South Africa after his discharge and, in 1903, enlisted in the <a href="Cape%20Colonial%20Forces">Cape Colonial Forces</a>. He was made a sergeant in <a href="Cape%20Field%20Artillery">Prince Alfred's Own Cape Field Artillery</a>, with which he served until 1907. While living in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, Shout married Rose Alice Howe, an Australian from <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, in 1905; the couple had a daughter named Florence in June that year. In 1907, the Shout family immigrated to Australia, settling in the Sydney suburb of <a href="Darlington%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Darlington</a>. Here, Shout gained employment as a <a href="Carpentry">carpenter</a> and <a href="joiner">joiner</a> at <a href="Resch%27s">Resch's</a> Brewery. He also joined the 29th Infantry Regiment of the part-time <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Citizens' Forces</a> shortly after arriving in Sydney, was a foundation member of the 29th Infantry Club, and a regular visitor at the <a href="Randwick%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Randwick</a> rifle range, where he gained a reputation as an excellent shot. Shout was <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commissioned</a> as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the Citizens' Forces on 16 June 1914.

Following the outbreak of the First World War, Shout applied for a commission in the newly raised <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) on 18 August 1914. The AIF was formed as Australia's <a href="Expeditionary%20warfare">expeditionary force</a> to fight in the war, as the Citizens' Forces were restricted to home defence per the Defence Act (1903). Shout's application was accepted on 28 August and he was posted to the <a href="1st%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">1st Battalion</a> as a second lieutenant in F Company, commanded by Lieutenant Cecil Sasse. According to his medical assessment at the time, Shout stood at , weighed , and was recorded as having "good" eyesight. On 18 October, the 1st Battalion embarked for the Middle East, with Shout boarding HMAT "Afric" at Sydney. Sailing via <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany, Western Australia</a>, the troopship arrived in Egypt on 2 December. Shortly after, the 1st Battalion was reorganised into four companies; Shout was allotted to D Company as a <a href="platoon">platoon</a> commander. The battalion spent the next four months training in the Egyptian desert, during which time Shout was promoted <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> on 1 February 1915.

As part of an endeavour to defeat the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and force a supply route through to Russia via the <a href="Bosporus">Bosporus</a> and the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>, the British War Council formulated a plan to invade the <a href="Gallipoli%20Peninsula">Gallipoli Peninsula</a>. On 25 April 1915, the men of the <a href="1st%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">1st Australian Brigade</a>—of which the 1st Battalion was part—<a href="Landing%20at%20Anzac%20Cove">landed at Anzac Cove</a> between 05:30 and 07:30 among the second and third waves of Australian troops. The 1st Battalion was meant to be held in reserve, but due to heavy casualties and confusion the unit soon went into action. Following a request for reinforcements, Shout moved up with one of the 1st Battalion's companies to the hill feature Baby 700. Arriving at the position around 11:00, he led a party to hold the rear left flank of the hill as part of the Australians' rearguard action. The Australian position on Baby 700 had become dire by that afternoon, a situation compounded by the small number of available infantry in the area and the complete lack of artillery support, when the Turkish forces launched a counter-assault. By this time, Shout and Lieutenant <a href="Leslie%20Morshead">Leslie Morshead</a> of the <a href="2nd%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2nd Battalion</a> were the only two surviving officers in their sector of the line. At 16:30, the Turks broke through the defensive line and the Australians were forced to abandon their position on the hill. Shout was one of the last to evacuate, and withdrew down towards the beach. During his retreat, Shout encountered Lieutenant Colonel <a href="George%20Braund">George Braund</a>, commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, on Walker's Ridge. Braund dispatched Shout to the beach with a request for reinforcements. Shout duly relayed the message, and was immediately tasked with leading 200 stray men to reinforce the thin defensive line near Braund's position. Shout established a post at the base of the ridge as dusk began to fall, and his men started to dig in.

By 27 April, Shout had been continually in action without rest since the landing. That morning, he was sent to Walker's Ridge to replace a wounded officer in a vulnerable sector of the line. As the Turks occupied positions in the scrub just beyond the Australians' trench, Shout and his men were subjected to accurate and heavy rifle fire throughout the day. Accordingly, Shout reorganised his men and, exposing himself to the Turks' fire, ventured out to reconnoitre the enemy's position. He was then able to accurately direct the rifle fire of his men. Though wounded early in the action, Shout refused to leave the frontline. As the fighting wore on, the Turks closed in on the Australian trench and Shout led a bayonet charge to hold them at bay. He was later wounded a second time, a bullet passing through his arm and rendering it useless. Still, he refused to leave. Soon after, he was wounded a third time and evacuated for medical treatment. During the engagement, Shout had carried several wounded men away from the frontline. Cited for his "conspicuous courage and ability" at Walker's Ridge, Shout was awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a>, becoming the first member of his battalion to receive the decoration. The notification and accompanying citation for the award was published in a supplement to the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 3 July 1915.

Shout's wounds proved to be relatively light and he soon rejoined the 1st Battalion. On 11 May, he was wounded once again, suffering a second gunshot to his arm. He was evacuated to the hospital ship HMHS "Gascon", but rejoined his unit fifteen days later. On 20 May, Shout was <a href="Mentioned%20in%20Despatches">mentioned in the despatch</a> of General <a href="Ian%20Standish%20Monteith%20Hamilton">Sir Ian Hamilton</a>, General Officer Commanding the <a href="Mediterranean%20Expeditionary%20Force">Mediterranean Expeditionary Force</a>, in recognition of his efforts from the landing on 25 April to 5 May. He was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">captain</a> on 29 July.

On 6 August 1915, the 1st Australian Brigade launched an assault on the impregnable Ottoman position at <a href="Battle%20of%20Lone%20Pine">Lone Pine</a>. Led by the 2nd, <a href="3rd%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">3rd</a> and <a href="4th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">4th Battalions</a> (with the 1st Battalion held in reserve), the attack was orchestrated to divert Turkish attention and reinforcements away from the primary operation to the north of the line as the British sought to capture the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sari%20Bair">Sari Bair ridge</a>. The Australian assault at Lone Pine commenced in the late afternoon just before sunset. An artillery barrage had preceded the attack, though according to historian Robin Prior the results had been "feeble" and the advance was hard-fought. Nonetheless, within half an hour the Australians had breached the Turkish trenches and seized their objectives. Despite the initial success, Australian casualties had been heavy and the 1st Battalion was ordered forward in preparation for the expected Turkish counter-attack. The battle descended into fierce fighting over the next three days, often in the form of what Bryan Perrett has described as "deadly bombing duels".

At 09:00 on 9 August, the day after Shout's 33rd birthday, the 1st Battalion relieved the 3rd Battalion on the Lone Pine front at a position known as Sasse's Sap. Soon after, the Turks renewed their attack and recaptured a stretch of the sap. Determined to rout these men, and supported by a few of his own soldiers, Shout charged down one trench throwing <a href="Grenade">bombs</a>. He killed eight Turks, and managed to clear others to retake the trench. Meanwhile, Captain Cecil Sasse—Shout's former company commander—gathered three men with sandbags, and cleared another section of the sap. Armed with a rifle, Sasse had charged down the trench at the head of his men. His party soon discovered a group of Turks focused on, and firing in, a different direction; Sasse and his men killed 12 and forced the remainder to flee. Sasse continued to keep the Turks at bay with rifle fire as his men barricaded the trench with the sandbags.

Sasse, described by official historian <a href="Charles%20Bean">Charles Bean</a> as "elated" by the achievement that morning, approached Shout with a proposal to repeat the feat. Shout agreed. The duo assembled a party of eight men this time to carry sandbags and extra bombs. Having reconnoitred the Turks' position, the previously erected barricade was shoved down and, side-by-side, Sasse and Shout ran forward. While Sasse fired his revolver and Shout lobbed bombs, the Australian party advanced in short stages along the trench and built a barricade each time they halted. Bean wrote that Shout fought with "splendid gaiety" throughout the assault, historian Stephen Snelling adding that Shout was "laughing and joking and cheering his men on". As the Australians progressed, the two officers located a suitable position to raise their final barricade. Readying himself for this final push forward, Shout simultaneously lit three bombs. He successfully threw two, but the third burst just as it was leaving his hand. Shout was grievously wounded; the explosion incinerated his right hand and part of the left, destroyed his left eye, cut his cheek, and caused burns to his chest and leg. Despite the severity of his wounds Shout remained conscious and was dragged out of the firing line, where, "still cheerful" according to Bean, he "drank tea and sent a message to his wife".

Shout was evacuated from the Gallipoli Peninsula to the hospital ship "Euralia" shortly after he was wounded. He died two days later, on 11 August 1915, and was <a href="Burial%20at%20sea">buried at sea</a>. Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Bennett, commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, labelled Shout's actions at Lone Pine as "brilliant" and described him as "unapproachable in his splendid leadership". Although Sasse's Sap was not completely recovered, Shout was posthumously awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> (VC) in recognition of his efforts to recover much of the trench system, while Sasse received the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>. Shout's VC was the seventh and final awarded to the AIF for the operations around Lone Pine, and the second to a member of the 1st Battalion. Shout's three gallantry awards from Gallipoli also marked him as the most highly decorated member of the AIF for the campaign.

The announcement of Shout's VC was promulgated in the "London Gazette" on 15 October 1915, reading:

There was considerable confusion following Shout's death. Army Headquarters in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> cabled Rose Shout on 15 August to inform her that Alfred had been wounded. Confirmation of his death was conveyed to her, but was contradicted by a later cable on 23 August. This communication stated that Shout was not dead, but alive and returning to Australia aboard the "Thermistocles". The press in Australia published news of his pending return, adding that he would arrive in Sydney in mid-September. This proved to be a case of mistaken identity. Shout's death was confirmed by 26 August; a Lieutenant A.J. Shirt, also of the 1st Battalion, was the officer aboard the "Thermistocles". Rose Shout received a ministerial apology for the clerical errors and distress caused.

Shout is commemorated on the <a href="Lone%20Pine%20Memorial">Lone Pine Memorial</a>, and he was remembered by the citizens of Darlington with a memorial plaque. The <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">governor-general</a>, <a href="Ronald%20Munro%20Ferguson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Novar">Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson</a>, unveiled the plaque at the Darlington Town Hall in a ceremony on 20 November 1915. The plaque has since entered the collections of the <a href="Victoria%20Barracks%2C%20Sydney">Victoria Barracks Museum</a> in <a href="Paddington%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Paddington</a>. In 1916, to honour "the heroic and glorious deeds and death" of Shout and relieve the financial strain placed upon his wife, a collection was taken up by local citizens in Sydney to provide Rose and their daughter with a house.

Until 2006 Shout's medals were in the possession of his family. That year, Shout's grandson decided to sell the medals to relieve some of the family debt and financial burdens. At the time Shout's VC was the only one awarded to a member of the AIF at Gallipoli that was not in the collection of the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a>. The medals were auctioned by the Sydney firm Bonhams & Goodman on 24 July 2006, and realised a world record hammer price of <a href="Australian%20dollar">AU$</a>1 million. The sale surpassed, almost doubling, the previous auction records for a medal—set by the <a href="Naval%20Gold%20Medal">Naval Gold Medal</a> awarded to <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Hardy%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet</a>—and the price paid for a VC,
previously held by that awarded to <a href="Norman%20Cyril%20Jackson">Norman Cyril Jackson</a>. Shout's medals were purchased by media mogul <a href="Kerry%20Stokes">Kerry Stokes</a>, who subsequently donated the set to the Australian War Memorial for display in the Hall of Valour.

William McGregor (football)

William McGregor ( 1846 – 1911) was a Scottish <a href="association%20football">association football</a> administrator in the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a> who is regarded as the founder of <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a>, the first organised association football league in the world.

After moving from <a href="Perthshire">Perthshire</a> to <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> to set up business as a <a href="draper">draper</a>, McGregor became involved with local football club <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, which he helped to establish as one of the leading teams in England. He served the club for over 20 years in various capacities, including president, director and chairman. In 1888, frustrated by the regular cancellation of Villa's matches, McGregor organised a meeting of representatives of England's leading clubs, which led to the formation of the Football League, giving member clubs a guaranteed fixture list each season. This was instrumental in the transition of football from an amateur pastime to a professional business.

McGregor served as both chairman and president of the Football League and was also chairman of <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> (the FA). He was recognised by the FA for his service to the game shortly before his death in 1911, and was posthumously honoured by the local football authorities and Aston Villa.

Born in <a href="Braco">Braco</a> in <a href="Perthshire">Perthshire</a>, Scotland, McGregor first became interested in <a href="association%20football">football</a> after watching a match between locals and visiting artisans at <a href="Ardoch%2C%20Perth%20and%20Kinross">Ardoch</a>. He served an apprenticeship as a <a href="draper">draper</a> in <a href="Perth%2C%20Scotland">Perth</a>, and in 1870, following the example of his brother Peter, moved to <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, and opened his own drapery business in <a href="Aston">Aston</a>, an area just outside the city. Upon his arrival in the <a href="English%20Midlands">English Midlands</a> he became involved with a local football club, Calthorpe, which had been formed by a fellow Scot, Campbell Orr. McGregor was enthusiastic enough about the game to arrange for his shop to close early on Saturdays to allow him to watch matches, and he later sold football <a href="Kit%20%28association%20football%29">kits</a> at the shop, which became a popular meeting place for football enthusiasts.

McGregor was married to Jessie, and the couple had a daughter and a son, also named Jessie and William. A <a href="teetotaller">teetotaller</a>, McGregor was a supporter of the <a href="Temperance%20movement">Temperance movement</a>, and was active in the local branch of the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a> until his membership lapsed in 1882 due to the increasing amount of time he devoted to football. He was involved in the early attempts to establish a baseball league in the United Kingdom, and served as the honorary treasurer of the Baseball Association of Great Britain and Ireland. Despite his commitment to sport, he held desperately on to his drapery business throughout his life.

McGregor was a committed Christian who was widely respected for his honesty and integrity. He worshipped for forty years at the Congregational church in Wheeler Street, Aston. His pastor, the Revd. W.G. Percival said that the best thing about him "was not so much the genial, kindly, honest sportsman, but the Christian behind it all". He described him as "a man of absolutely unblemished personal character".

In 1877, McGregor was invited to become a committee member of <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, a football club formed three years earlier. He also umpired matches for the club. At the time the club played at <a href="Aston%20Park%2C%20Birmingham">Aston Park</a>, close to the premises of McGregor's business. He became interested in joining Villa due to the strong Scottish contingent in the club's ranks, the team's exciting style of play, and the club's connection to a <a href="John%20Wesley">Wesleyan</a> Chapel. He quickly assumed the post of club administrator, helping the impecunious club to survive its financial troubles. After some of Aston Villa's possessions were seized by bailiffs, McGregor allowed the club to use his shop as a store to prevent further seizures. Under McGregor's leadership, Aston Villa won their first trophy, the <a href="Birmingham%20Senior%20Cup">Birmingham Senior Cup</a>, in 1880, shortly after which McGregor became the club's president.

The following year McGregor became a member of the club's board of directors. Villa's standing within the game continued to grow, and, in 1887, the club became the first from the <a href="English%20Midlands">Midlands</a> to win the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, defeating local rivals <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> in the final. In 1895, McGregor became vice-chairman, and went on to become the club's chairman in 1897. During his time at the club he was noted for his organisational skills and ambition, and was responsible for adopting the lion rampant depicted on the <a href="Royal%20Standard%20of%20Scotland">Royal Standard of Scotland</a>, as the club's crest.

As the 1880s progressed, the balance of power within English football began to change. The first national competition, the FA Cup, had previously been dominated by amateur clubs from privileged backgrounds, such as <a href="Wanderers%20F.C.">Wanderers</a> and <a href="Old%20Etonians%20F.C.">Old Etonians</a>. However the <a href="1883%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1883 FA Cup Final</a> saw the first victory by a working-class team, <a href="Blackburn%20Olympic%20F.C.">Blackburn Olympic</a>. At this time professionalism was not permitted. Clubs from urban areas in the north were strong advocates of the practice, but the southern amateur teams and the FA authorities were firmly opposed. Though not initially an advocate of professionalism, McGregor came to favour its introduction. By 1885 the issue threatened to split the FA when a group of clubs, predominantly from <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, announced their intention to leave and form a rival British Football Association if professionalism was not accepted. An emergency FA conference was called in response. Representing Aston Villa, McGregor spoke in favour of professionalism, the only delegate from the Midlands to do so, and was one of the few delegates to admit that his club had been paying players. Though not as outspoken as stronger proponents, such as Preston North End's <a href="William%20Sudell">William Sudell</a>, McGregor was well respected. The conference ended with the FA accepting professionalism, although each club was permitted only to pay players who had been born or lived for at least two years within six miles of its home stadium.

Professionalism brought fresh complications for club administrators. Many <a href="Exhibition%20match">friendlies</a> were cancelled due to opponents' FA Cup or <a href="county%20cup">county cup</a> matches taking precedence or clubs simply failing to honour a fixture in favour of a more lucrative match elsewhere. This made it hard for the clubs to pay players' wages on a regular basis. McGregor took action after seeing Villa matches cancelled, to the increasing frustration of the club's fans, on five consecutive Saturdays. On 1888, he wrote to the committee of his own club, Aston Villa, as well as to those of <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>, <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>, <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> and West Bromwich Albion, suggesting the creation of a league competition that would provide a number of guaranteed fixtures for its member clubs each season. <a href="Corinthian%20F.C.">Corinthian F.C.</a> founder N. Lane Jackson, writing in 1899, stated that McGregor took his inspiration from the existing league set-up used in American baseball, although McGregor himself cited the <a href="County%20Cricket%20Championship">County Cricket Championship</a> as his inspiration. McGregor's letter to the clubs read:

Every year it is becoming more and more difficult for football clubs of any standing to meet their friendly engagements and even arrange friendly matches. The consequence is that at the last moment, through cup-tie interference, clubs are compelled to take on teams who will not attract the public.<br>
I beg to tender the following suggestion as a means of getting over the difficulty: that ten or twelve of the most prominent clubs in England combine to arrange home-and-away fixtures each season, the said fixtures to be arranged at a friendly conference about the same time as the International Conference.<br>
This combination might be known as the Association Football Union, and could be managed by representative from each club. Of course, this is in no way to interfere with the National Association; even the suggested matches might be played under cup-tie rules. However, this is a detail.<br>
My object in writing to you at present is merely to draw your attention to the subject, and to suggest a friendly conference to discuss the matter more fully. I would take it as a favour if you would kindly think the matter over, and make whatever suggestions you deem necessary.
I am only writing to the following – Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End, West Bromwich Albion, and Aston Villa, and would like to hear what other clubs you would suggest.<br>
I am, yours very truly, William McGregor (Aston Villa F.C.)
P.S. How would Friday, 23 March 1888, suit for the friendly conference at Anderton's Hotel, London?

McGregor chose 23 March as the date of his proposed meeting because it was the day before the <a href="1888%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup final</a> and representatives of the country's top clubs would be in London. Representatives from ten clubs attended, including the FA Cup finalists West Bromwich Albion and Preston North End, but it quickly became clear that clubs from the South of England were not interested in McGregor's proposal and none attended. A second meeting was held in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> on , and details concerning the new competition were finalised. McGregor's suggested name for the competition, "The Association Football Union" was rejected as too similar to that of the <a href="Rugby%20Football%20Union">Rugby Football Union</a> and "<a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a>" was chosen, despite McGregor's opposition on the grounds that he felt it might invoke associations with the unpopular <a href="Irish%20Land%20League">Irish Land League</a>. The term "English League" was avoided, to leave the possibility of future applications from Scottish clubs. McGregor also proposed a rule that only one club from each town should be included. The other founders agreed to this rule, which caused controversy, as it meant Birmingham team <a href="Birmingham%20St%20George%27s%20F.C.">Mitchell St. George's</a> were denied membership in favour of McGregor's Aston Villa. Twelve clubs kicked off the first season of League football in September 1888.
McGregor served as the first chairman of the League's Management Committee. One of the committee's main jobs was handling issues of discipline, but committee members were not barred from involvement in decisions involving their own clubs. In fact, the first disciplinary meeting saw fines issued to three of the four clubs with representatives on the committee. McGregor was re-elected unopposed in 1891. Earlier he had spoken of his pleasure that "of the 132 matches in which the League clubs have taken part and in which about 300 players have taken the field, not a single fatal accident has to be recorded". A year later he oversaw the expansion of the Football League into two divisions when the rival <a href="Football%20Alliance">Football Alliance</a> was merged into the competition, but he relinquished his post later that year due to ill health, which caused him to miss meetings.

After stepping down as chairman, he was unanimously elected to an honorary position of president, a role he kept until 1894, and was named the first-ever life member of the League in 1895. The role was that of a figurehead with little actual authority, but he was used as a mediator to resolve league disagreements. In the second half of the decade McGregor's failure to attend many committee meetings led to criticism from <a href="John%20Bentley%20%28football%20manager%29">John Bentley</a>, his successor as president. Bentley's criticism achieved the desired effect; from 1899 until his health deteriorated in 1910, McGregor seldom missed a meeting. During this period McGregor was noted for his reserved nature. He was silent for large parts of committee meetings, but would contribute enthusiastically on the occasions he felt his input was necessary.

Between 1888 and 1894 McGregor also served as chairman of <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> (the FA), English football's overall governing body, which had existed since 1863. He became known as a football celebrity, writing a weekly column for the "<a href="Birmingham%20Gazette">Birmingham Gazette</a>" and endorsing products such as footballs, and a type of football boot which the manufacturer billed as the "McGregor lace-to-toe boot". Though he held many different administrative posts in his lifetime, McGregor never played the sport competitively; his only on-pitch involvement was occasional goalkeeping during Aston Villa practices in the 1870s.

Although McGregor envisaged the League as a friendly union, within which clubs would share ticket revenues and work together in their mutual best interests, the immediate effect of its creation was that football came to be treated as a business for the first time, as opposed to something that players and officials simply regarded as a pastime. All the clubs involved experienced significant increases in their turnover, which at Aston Villa, McGregor's own club, increased more than sixfold between 1889 and 1899. The wages paid to players, however, remained low due to restrictions imposed by the FA, so clubs were able to use their increased profitability to build larger stadiums and accommodate ever larger crowds of spectators. Although the League initially contained a small number of clubs, all of which were based in the northern half of the country, by the early years of the twentieth century it included clubs from all parts of England. At its peak nearly 100 clubs played in the Football League, and it remained the pre-eminent competition in English football until the 1990s, when the top clubs broke away to form the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>. In keeping with McGregor's views on mutual support and co-operation, gate receipts were shared amongst the clubs until the 1980s, which helped to ensure that a select few wealthy clubs were not able to dominate the competition. McGregor himself had little interest in the business aspect of football, and was adamant that the Football League should not challenge the longstanding authority of the FA. The success of the Football League directly inspired the creation of similar competitions in other countries, beginning with Scotland, where the <a href="Scottish%20Football%20League">Scottish Football League</a> was formed in 1890.

In May 1910, McGregor was taken ill and later confined to a nursing home. His condition worsened towards the end of 1911. His last public appearance was a committee meeting on , and he underwent an operation on . However, after a brief improvement in his condition he relapsed and died the following day. Although a devout <a href="Congregationalist">Congregationalist</a>, he is buried in the grounds of a <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> church, <a href="St.%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Handsworth">St. Mary's</a>, in the <a href="Handsworth%2C%20West%20Midlands">Handsworth</a> district of <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, alongside his wife, who died in 1908. McGregor is remembered as the "father of The Football League", an Aston Villa legend, and a legend of football in general.

Shortly before his death, the FA presented McGregor, who was at that time a vice-president of the association, with a long service medal. After his death, Aston Villa dedicated a bed in the children's ward of one of Birmingham's hospitals in his honour, and the <a href="Birmingham%20County%20Football%20Association">Birmingham County Football Association</a> unveiled a commemorative drinking fountain, which is now preserved at <a href="Villa%20Park">Villa Park</a>, current home of his former club. In the modern era, Aston Villa selected him as one of the twelve inaugural members of its Hall of Fame, and named a hospitality suite at Villa Park after him. In 2008, the Aston Villa Supporters' Trust announced plans to further honour him with a bronze statue outside the stadium. The statue, by sculptor <a href="Sam%20Holland">Sam Holland</a>, is displayed outside the Directors' Entrance of the Trinity Road Stand, and was unveiled on 2009. The Trust also raised £1,000 to restore and rededicate McGregor's grave in 2011.

Ontario Highway 403

King's Highway 403 (pronounced "four-oh-three"), or simply Highway 403, is a <a href="400-series%20highways%20%28Ontario%29">400-series highway</a> in the <a href="Provinces%20and%20territories%20of%20Canada">Canadian province</a> of <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> that travels between <a href="Woodstock%2C%20Ontario">Woodstock</a> and <a href="Mississauga">Mississauga</a>, branching off from and reuniting with <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20401">Highway 401</a> at both ends and travelling south of it through <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Ontario">Hamilton</a> (where it is also known as the Chedoke Expressway) and Mississauga. It is <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">concurrent</a> with the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20Way">Queen Elizabeth Way</a> (QEW) for from <a href="Burlington%2C%20Ontario">Burlington</a> to <a href="Oakville%2C%20Ontario">Oakville</a>. Although the Highway 403 designation was first applied in 1963 to a short stub of freeway branching off the QEW, the entire route was not completed until August 15, 1997, when the section from <a href="Brantford">Brantford</a> to the then-still independent Town of <a href="Ancaster%2C%20Ontario">Ancaster</a> was opened to traffic. The section of Highway 403 between Woodstock and Burlington was formally dedicated as the Alexander Graham Bell Parkway on April 27, 2016.

The majority of Highway 403 is surrounded by suburban land use, except west of Ancaster, where it passes through agricultural land; Brantford is the only urban area through this section. In Hamilton, Highway 403 descends the <a href="Niagara%20Escarpment">Niagara Escarpment</a>, then wraps around the northern side of <a href="Hamilton%20Harbour">Hamilton Harbour</a> to encounter the QEW. From there, <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">co-signed</a> with the QEW, it travels straight through Burlington and Oakville, departing from the QEW to the north at the Mississauga–Oakville boundary. The freeway then crosses through the centre of Mississauga in an east–west direction, serving its city centre, before turning north. Highway 403 then ends at Highway 401, but the physical freeway continues north of Highway 401 as <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20410">Highway 410</a> to <a href="Brampton">Brampton</a>.

Highway 403 begins at a junction with Highway 401 on the outskirts of Woodstock. The eastbound lanes split from eastbound Highway 401, whereas the westbound lanes merge into westbound Highway 401.
It travels along the back lot lines of the second <a href="Concession%20road">concession</a> south of former Highway 2.
It passes beneath <a href="Oxford%20County%20Road%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B55">Oxford County Road 55</a> (formerly Highway 53) and curves southeast. After crossing into the third concession, it curves back to the east. The highway travels straight for several kilometres, meeting with the southern leg of <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2024">Highway 24</a>, which travels south to <a href="Simcoe%2C%20Ontario">Simcoe</a>.

The highway crosses the <a href="Grand%20River%20%28Ontario%29">Grand River</a> to the south of <a href="Paris%2C%20Ontario">Paris</a>, then passes over former Highway 2 as it enters <a href="Brantford">Brantford</a>. As it passes through Brantford, the highway angles southeast and passes beneath the northern leg of Highway 24 and then the Wayne Gretzky Parkway. The route exits the small city to the east and curves northeast shortly thereafter. It travels between Jerseyville Road and former Highway 2 to <a href="Ancaster%2C%20Ontario">Ancaster</a>, jogging to avoid cutting through Dunmark Lake. As the freeway enters Ancaster, it once again crosses former Highway 2 and dips through the southern side of the town.
East of Ancaster, the freeway passes through a short greenbelt, with <a href="Hamilton%20Golf%20and%20Country%20Club">Hamilton Golf and Country Club</a> lying to the north. A divided segment of <a href="Ontario%20Highway%206">Highway 6</a> meets the freeway and continues concurrently with it through Hamilton; to the south, Highway 6 travels to <a href="John%20C.%20Munro%20International%20Airport">John C. Munro International Airport</a>, <a href="Caledonia%2C%20Ontario">Caledonia</a>, and <a href="Jarvis%2C%20Ontario">Jarvis</a> at <a href="Ontario%20Highway%203">Highway 3</a>. Continuing east, Highway 403 and Highway 6 curve north into Hamilton and meet the <a href="Lincoln%20M.%20Alexander%20Parkway">Lincoln M. Alexander Parkway</a> before abruptly turning to the east and descending the <a href="Niagara%20Escarpment">Niagara Escarpment</a>. Scenic views of Hamilton, <a href="Hamilton%20Harbour">its harbour</a>, and <a href="Princess%20Falls">Lower Princess Falls</a> are along this steep descent. At the bottom of the escarpment the highway travels through a narrow, heavily developed corridor alongside former <a href="Ontario%20Highway%208">Highway 8</a>. It passes beneath multiple bridges in a depressed trench, eventually curving north at a sharp corner and passing beneath more bridges. This section features a reduced speed limit of as opposed to .
The highway returns to ground level alongside the Chedoke Creek, a now-channelized river from which the freeway may take its name.

As the freeway continues north, it crosses an <a href="isthmus">isthmus</a> between Hamilton Harbour and <a href="Cootes%20Paradise">Cootes Paradise</a> alongside several roads which it has served to replace. It circles around the northern shore of Hamilton Harbour and returns to an eastward orientation. The concurrency with Highway 6 ends at an interchange where Highway 403 continues east and Highway 6 departs north towards <a href="Guelph%2C%20Ontario">Guelph</a>. The freeway continues straight for several kilometres and encounters the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20Way">Queen Elizabeth Way</a> and <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20407">Highway 407</a> at the Freeman Interchange.

Highway 403 travels concurrently with the QEW for between the Freeman Interchange and Oakville, a straight section surrounded almost entirely by commercial units and warehouses. At the <a href="Oakville%20Assembly">Ford Assembly Plant</a> near the <a href="Regional%20Municipality%20of%20Halton">Halton</a>–<a href="Regional%20Municipality%20of%20Peel">Peel</a> regional boundary, Highway 403 branches off from the QEW and heads north for along the western edge of Mississauga. Here it interchanges with Highway 407 again, but the two freeways curve at 90 degrees to avoid each other. Highway 407 continues to the north and west, while Highway 403 turns east to follow alongside a <a href="hydro%20corridor">hydro corridor</a> through the centre of Mississauga. From this interchange to Highway 401, <a href="high-occupancy%20vehicle%20lane">high-occupancy vehicle</a> (HOV) lanes are present in the shoulder lanes for vehicles with at least one passenger. Sandwiched between residential subdivisions on both sides, the freeway passes beneath <a href="Erin%20Mills%20Parkway">Erin Mills Parkway</a> and crosses the <a href="Credit%20River%20%28Ontario%29">Credit River</a>.

On the other side of the river, Highway 403 skirts to the north of downtown Mississauga, as well as the <a href="Square%20One%20Shopping%20Centre">Square One Shopping Centre</a>. It passes beneath <a href="Hurontario%20Street">Hurontario Street</a> (formerly <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2010">Highway 10</a>) and begins to widen before abruptly curving to the north as it approaches <a href="Cawthra%20Road">Cawthra Road</a>. As the curve ends, the freeway widens further into ten lanes. This short section passes beneath <a href="Eglinton%20Avenue">Eglinton Avenue</a> and begins to diverge into a sprawling interchange with Highways <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20410">410</a> and 401, where the route terminates. The highway meets Highway 410, which runs northward to <a href="Brampton">Brampton</a>, at the <a href="Local-express%20lanes">collector</a> lanes, just south of Highway 401 401, where the highway curves east and ends soon after by feeding into both the eastbound collector and express lanes.

Though one of the first divided highways conceived for Ontario, Highway 403 is one of the most recently-completed freeways in the province; the multiple segments of the route did not become continuous until 2002. Planning for the route was underway by 1958, with the completion of the Freeman Bypass along the QEW providing a three-legged junction for the new freeway. Sections of Highway 403 through Hamilton opened between December 1963 and September 1969. An isolated section known as the Brantford Bypass was opened in October 1966, and would remain unconnected to other freeways for over 20 years. Plans for a third segment through Mississauga were contemplated throughout the 1960s, but were not finalized until late 1977, after which construction began. Portions opened at both ends in 1980 and 1981, while the central gap, crossing the Credit River, was completed in December 1982.

Construction to bridge the gaps in Highway 403 between Ancaster and Woodstock was carried out over three major phases. The first phase was a short extension of the Brantford Bypass beginning in 1975. Later, work began to connect that extension with Highway 401 near Woodstock, opening in 1988. The last phase, between Ancaster and Brantford, was opened in 1997.
The final discontinuity, between Burlington and Oakville, was signed as a concurrency with the QEW in 2002. Originally, this section was to have travelled along the corridor occupied by Highway 407, until budget shortfalls in 1995 resulted in a change of plans.

The corridor that connects London and Hamilton has always been considered important to Ontario. In late October 1793, Captain Smith and 100 <a href="Queen%27s%20Rangers">Queen's Rangers</a> returned from carving The Governor's Road through the thick forests between <a href="Dundas%2C%20Ontario">Dundas</a> and the present location of <a href="Paris%2C%20Ontario">Paris</a>. <a href="John%20Graves%20Simcoe">John Graves Simcoe</a> was tasked with defending <a href="Upper%20Canada">Upper Canada</a> from the United States following the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a> and with opening the virgin territory to settlement. After establishing a "temporary" capital at <a href="Toronto%23History">York</a>, Simcoe ordered an inland route constructed between <a href="Dundas%2C%20Ontario">Cootes Paradise</a> at the tip of <a href="Lake%20Ontario">Lake Ontario</a> and his proposed capital of <a href="London%2C%20Ontario">London</a>. By the spring of 1794, the road was extended as far as La Tranche, now the <a href="Thames%20River%20%28Ontario%29">Thames River</a>. Today, most of this route forms part of former <a href="Ontario%20Highway%202">Highway 2</a> and former <a href="Ontario%20Highway%205">Highway 5</a>.

The paving of the divided four-lane <a href="The%20Middle%20Road">Middle Road</a>, with gentle curves, a grass median, and <a href="grade-separated">grade-separated</a> interchanges, would set the stage for the freeway concept. It was the first intercity freeway in North America when it opened in June 1939.
<a href="Thomas%20McQuesten">Thomas McQuesten</a>, the new minister of the Department of Highways and the man most responsible for the Middle Road, decided to apply the concept to sections of Highway 2 plagued with <a href="traffic%20congestion">congestion</a>. A portion east of Woodstock was rebuilt in this fashion, but <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> would put an end to the McQuesten's ambitions, at least temporarily.

The end of the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> heralded the resumption of freeway construction in Ontario; the advances in machinery more than made up for lost time.
The construction of Highway 401 across the province took first priority. However, the opening of the section from Highway 4 near London to Highway 2 east of Woodstock on May 31, 1957 would complete part of the route required between London and Hamilton.
By 1958, planning on the Chedoke Expressway, or Controlled Access Highway 403, was well underway,
though plans for a four-lane freeway between Woodstock and Hamilton existed as early as 1954.
The opening of the Freeman Bypass of the QEW in August 1958 provided a connection point for a new freeway,
and construction began the same day that the <a href="Burlington%20Bay%20James%20N.%20Allan%20Skyway">Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway</a> opened: October 31, 1958.
Highway 403 between Longwood Road (Highway 2) and the QEW was opened to traffic on December 1, 1963 at a length of . Work was already underway on the next section of the route that would extend it to <a href="Aberdeen%20Avenue">Aberdeen Avenue</a>.
That section opened on July 9, 1965, extending the freeway by .

Meanwhile, to the west, work had begun on a bypass of Brantford. The new freeway passed north of the city between Paris Road in the west and the junction of Highway 2 and <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2053">Highway 53</a> in the east, a distance of ; it opened October 31, 1966.
A portion of the Brantford Bypass was itself bypassed in 1997 when the final section of Highway 403 was completed and is known as Garden Avenue.
However, the Brantford Bypass would remain an isolated section of Highway 403 for over 20 years.

In Hamilton, work was underway on an extension of the Chedoke Expressway to Mohawk Road, crossing the Niagara Escarpment. This tedious project, which required extensive rock blasting, was soon accompanied by construction from Mohawk Road to Highway 2 near Ancaster. Both projects were completed together and originally scheduled to be opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on August 22, 1969.
However, local residents complained the new section lacked any barriers preventing children from wandering onto the highway, postponing the ceremony until August 27 as temporary snow fencing was erected. This proved inadequate, and protests grew more vocal over the following week. Several petitions were presented to Deputy Highway Minister H. Howden on August 26, and the ceremonies were cancelled.
Over the following week, Minister of Highways <a href="George%20Gomme">George Gomme</a> met with residents and reached a compromise whereby a 24–hour patrol was established to watch for children until a proper fence could be constructed. The route was opened on September 3, without any ceremony.
This completed the Hamilton section of Highway 403.

Planning for the segment of Highway 403 through Mississauga dates to the late 1950s when the Hamilton Expressway appeared on the <a href="Metropolitan%20Toronto">Metropolitan Toronto</a>'s regional transportation plan. It was to be a continuation of the <a href="Richview%20Expressway">Richview Expressway</a>, which was ultimately never built, continuing from Toronto to Hamilton. The plan featured the expressway's eastern terminus at the Highway 401 and Highway 427 interchange. As Toronto's anti-expressway movement gained momentum, provincial plans shifted the Hamilton Expressway to the west near <a href="Etobicoke%20Creek">Etobicoke Creek</a>. In 1962, the right-of-way alongside the <a href="Hydro%20One">hydro</a> corridor between Burlington and Etobicoke Creek was protected after traffic studies indicated the need for a future freeway.
On May 25, 1965, the Department of Highways unveiled the Toronto Region Western Section Highway Planning Study. The plan designated Highway 403 north from Burlington and then parallel with the QEW to Highway 401 near Highway 27.

By the time construction was actually underway, plans had been completely modified to connect the overburdened QEW at Oakville with Highway 401 at the new Highway 410 interchange.
This interchange was a better connection point for Highway 403, but would also require the widening of Highway 401 from six lanes to twelve. Plans were submitted and approved in December 1977 by Mississauga city council, and construction began.
The new freeway opened in sections during the early 1980s. The first section between Cawthra Road and Highway 401 was opened August 18, 1980.
This was followed by a short section from <a href="Ontario%20Highway%205">Highway 5</a> (Dundas Street) south to the QEW at Ford Drive, which opened in mid-1981, with a further extension to Erin Mills Parkway opening on November 17th of that year.
The final section to be opened took the longest to complete, involving construction of two bridges over the <a href="Credit%20River%20%28Ontario%29">Credit River</a> valley; it opened on December 2, 1982. The cost of the entire Mississauga segment was $87 million.

Around the same period, the Ministry of Transportation began to study upgrading Highway 401 to a collector–express system between Renforth Drive and Highway 403, and along Highway 403 between Highway 401 and Highway 10.
This took place between late 1982 and the summer of 1985; the existing outermost ramps from Highway 403 to Highway 401 eastbound were re-designated to serve collector traffic, as a pair of flyover ramps were added inside the interchange to serve motorists in the express lanes.

The right-of-way originally intended for Highway 403 between Cawthra Road and Etobicoke Creek was eventually used for a controlled access arterial extension called Eastgate Parkway, which was planned beginning in 1982.
The extension was built between 1988 and 1994, incorporating a portion of Fieldgate Drive at the eastern end.
The first section, between Cawthra Road and Dixie Road, opened in early 1991.
This was followed several years later by the section from Dixie Road to Eglinton Avenue that opened in late 1994.

In the fall of 1991, alongside the widening of Highway 410 into a full freeway, construction began on the connecting ramps between Highway 403 and Highway 410, which pass under the existing bridge structures for Highway 401 collector traffic, while new overpasses were constructed in the centre for Highway 401 express lanes. The loop ramp from Highway 410 southbound to Highway 401 eastbound was replaced by a semi-directional high-speed flyover, while a new directional ramp and semi-direction flyover were added to serve westbound Highway 401 commuters. Prior to the opening of this link, traffic from both freeways was forced onto eastbound Highway 401.
The link opened on November 2, 1992 at a cost of $7.3 million.

In 1975, construction began on a westward extension of the Brantford Bypass, from Highway 2 (Paris Road) to Rest Acres Road, which would become Highway 24. This work consisted of the twin bridges over the Grand River and an interchange at Rest Acres Road. The <a href="Canadian%20National%20Railway">Canadian National Railway</a> underpass west of Highway 2 was built by the railway.
By the beginning of 1978, this work was completed.
Work resumed west of Highway 24 during the spring of 1982 to connect with Highway 401 near Woodstock to relieve the high traffic volumes along Highway 2.
This included interchanges at Brant County Road 25 and Highway 53.
A section from Highway 24 to County Road 25 was opened in November 1984,
followed by the section west of there to Highway 53 one year later.
Construction of the gap between Highway 53 and Highway 401 began in late 1985,
followed by the Highway 401 overpass for the westbound lanes, which began in 1987.
Transportation minister <a href="Ed%20Fulton">Ed Fulton</a> ceremoniously opened the new freeway connection on September 26, 1988, completing the Woodstock to Brantford link.

Highway 403 was briefly left with three discontinuous sections: Woodstock–Brantford, Ancaster–Burlington, and Oakville–Mississauga. Between Brantford and Ancaster, traffic was defaulted onto Highway 2, a four-lane road with numerous private driveways and at-grade intersections. On March 24, 1987, <a href="Chris%20Ward%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">Chris Ward</a>, <a href="Member%20of%20Provincial%20Parliament%20%28Ontario%29">MPP</a> for <a href="Wentworth%20North">Wentworth North</a> officially announced that construction of the missing link between Brantford and Ancaster would begin in 1989.
Construction did not actually begin until the summer of 1990. It included interchanges at Garden Avenue, Highway 52 and Highway 2.
A continuous construction program was carried out over the next seven years, with the link opening on August 15, 1997.
Highway 2, which was the only parallel route before the completion of Highway 403, was subsequently downloaded to regional jurisdiction.

Though some officials considered Highway 403 to be a perfect example of a freeway construction process, it was not built without its share of controversy. In addition to the previously mentioned issues that occurred in 1969, portions of the freeway through Mississauga were built alongside established communities, leading to angry homeowners' associations pressuring the province for <a href="noise%20mitigation">noise mitigation</a> measures and compensation.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Mississauga section of Highway 403 was the site of more than two dozen fatal accidents over a five-year period, one of the highest rates in North America at the time, despite being up to modern road standards. This led <a href="Peel%20Regional%20Police">Peel Regional Police</a> and the media to nickname it the "Death Highway."
In particular, the stretch from Mavis Road to Erin Mills Parkway has been the site of numerous accidents. In this section, Highway 403 features a downward slope as motorists head eastbound towards the Mavis Road interchange; drivers complain of having to slam on the brakes when traffic comes to a standstill, leading to rear-end collisions. There is also glare from the sun that causes vision problems throughout the day.

The Hamilton-Brantford and Mississauga sections of Highway 403 were initially planned to be linked up along the corridor now occupied by <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20407">Highway 407</a>. However, the <a href="Bob%20Rae">Bob Rae</a> government altered these plans in 1995 due to budgetary constraints.
It was also announced the Mississauga section of Highway 403 would be renumbered as Highway 410.
Ultimately, this never came to pass.
Consequently, Highway 403 was <a href="Concurrency%20%28road%29">signed concurrently</a> along the Queen Elizabeth Way in 2002, remedying the discontinuity.
In early 2001, high-mast lighting was scheduled to be added to the unlighted Mississauga section between Highway 407 and Eastgate Parkway.
In 2003, the right shoulders between Erin Mills Parkway and Mavis Road were widened for GO Transit and Mississauga Transit to run express bus services.
These projects preceded the widening of Highway 403 between Highway 407 and Highway 401/410, through which a <a href="high-occupancy%20vehicle">high-occupancy vehicle</a> (HOV) lane was added in each direction; the project started in summer of 2004 and these opened on December 13, 2005.
The HOV lanes and the dividing <a href="Jersey%20barrier">Ontario Tall Wall</a> concrete barrier were constructed using the existing right-of-way provided by the grass median.
Highway 403 between Woodstock and Burlington was formally dedicated as the <a href="Alexander%20Graham%20Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a> Parkway on April 27, 2016.

Sufficient right-of-way exists at the Highway 401/403/410 junction for a loop ramp from Highway 403 eastbound to Highway 401 westbound, and a directional ramp for the opposite movement. This would give Highway 401 eastbound traffic direct access to Cawthra Road, making it a full <a href="Stack%20interchange">four-way interchange</a>. Construction is underway on these links as of 2017, after Highway 401 was recently widened to a 12-lane collector-express system west of the interchange.

In Oakville, improvements are being made to the Highway 403/QEW/Ford Drive interchange. As of 2017, traffic using the existing loop ramp in the NE corner to access Highway 403/QEW will be directed onto a new overpass instead of sharing the existing overpass with westbound Highway 403 traffic, which should allow for longer merging lanes since the convergence of Highway 403 and the QEW is an infamous bottleneck. At the present Highway 403 only connects to the QEW west of the interchange, but flyover ramps are being proposed from Highway 403 to the QEW east of that junction using the existing right-of-way which would allow for a direct freeway connection from Milton to south Mississauga.

Walter Peeler

Walter "Wally" Peeler, <a href="Victoria%20Cross">VC</a>, <a href="British%20Empire%20Medal">BEM</a> (9 August 1887 – 23 May 1968) was an <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20Victoria%20Cross%20recipients">Australian recipient</a> of the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, the highest award for gallantry "in the face of the enemy" that can be awarded to members of the British and <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> armed forces. He was decorated following his actions during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Broodseinde">Battle of Broodseinde</a> in October 1917. Then a <a href="lance%20corporal">lance corporal</a> in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a>, he repeatedly took the lead in the 37th Battalion's advance on well-defended German positions, destroying four machine gun posts and killing more than 30 German soldiers during the battle.

Born in <a href="Castlemaine%2C%20Victoria">Castlemaine, Victoria</a>, Peeler worked at various jobs in his home town and in the Melbourne area before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in February 1916. Posted to the <a href="3rd%20Pioneer%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">3rd Pioneer Battalion</a>, he arrived on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> during November. In June 1917, his battalion participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Messines%20%281917%29">assault on Messines ridge</a>, where he was lightly wounded. Eight days after his Victoria Cross action, Peeler was severely wounded in his right arm and spent the next seven months recuperating in the United Kingdom. Following the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany%20%28Compi%C3%A8gne%29">armistice with Germany</a>, he was discharged from service with the rank of sergeant in December 1918.

Peeler re-settled with his family in Victoria, and was appointed the inaugural custodian of Melbourne's <a href="Shrine%20of%20Remembrance">Shrine of Remembrance</a> in 1934. In May 1940, Peeler enlisted for service in the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, understating his age by fourteen years to avoid the upper age limit imposed on volunteers. He was posted to the <a href="2/2nd%20Pioneer%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/2nd Pioneer Battalion</a> and initially saw action in the <a href="Syria-Lebanon%20Campaign">Syria-Lebanon Campaign</a>. However, with the entry of Japan into the war, his unit was one of the first sent to the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Netherlands East Indies</a> in early 1942. Originally destined for <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> it was diverted to <a href="Java">Java</a> and after disembarking assisted in the Dutch defence of the island. When Dutch resistance collapsed in March, allied forces in Java signed a formal surrender with British, Australian and American troops becoming prisoners of war. After three-and-a-half years as <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a>, Peeler was freed in August 1945 and returned to Australia in October, resuming his duties at the Shrine of Remembrance. He retired in 1964 and, aged 80, died at his home in <a href="Caulfield%20South%2C%20Victoria">South Caulfield</a> on 23 May 1968.

Walter "Wally" Peeler was born at Barker's Creek, near <a href="Castlemaine%2C%20Victoria">Castlemaine, Victoria</a>, on 9 August 1887. He was the eighth child of William Peeler, a farmer and miner, and his English-born wife Mary Ellen (née Scott). As a youth Peeler worked in his parent's orchard, before gaining employment with Thompson's Foundry in Castlemaine. On 10 July 1907, he wed Emma Hewitt; the couple were to have five children. An active sportsman, Peeler was a member of the Castlemaine Cricket Club and, briefly, secretary of the Wesley Hill Football Club.

By 1916, Peeler was living in the <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> suburb of <a href="Richmond%2C%20Victoria">Richmond</a> with his wife and three daughters. On 17 February, he enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> for service in the First World War. Posted as a <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a> soldier to the machine gun section of the <a href="3rd%20Pioneer%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">3rd Pioneer Battalion</a>, Peeler underwent his initial training in Victoria, before departing from Melbourne headed for England aboard <a href="HMAT%20Wandilla">HMAT "Wandilla"</a> on 6 June. The battalion arrived in <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> seven weeks later. During the three months Peeler's unit spent in England undergoing additional training, he was charged with being <a href="AWOL">absent without leave</a> for six hours on 3 July, and fined a day's pay. He was nevertheless promoted to <a href="lance%20corporal">lance corporal</a> on 6 November.

Two weeks later, the 3rd Pioneer Battalion was posted to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. Sent to the <a href="Armenti%C3%A8res">Armentières</a> sector, the battalion spent several months working on trench and railway construction. In mid-December, Peeler attended a week-long course at the Machine Gun School in <a href="Le%20Touquet-Paris-Plage">Le Touquet</a>, and in early 1917, accompanied the battalion north in preparation for the upcoming <a href="Battle%20of%20Messines%20%281917%29">Messines offensive</a>. However, on 8 May 1917, one month before the offensive, Peeler found himself the subject of a <a href="Drumhead%20court-martial">court-martial in the field</a>. Following an incident that occurred during a training session on 26 April, he was charged with "careless and negligent handling of a Lewis Gun whilst instructing" that led to "grievous bodily injury" to Private John Martin Fife. Found guilty of the charge, Peeler was stripped of his lance corporal stripe.

On 7 June 1917, Peeler participated in the initial assault on Messines Ridge. Manning a <a href="Lewis%20Gun">Lewis Gun</a> during the action, he was injured twice, suffering shrapnel wounds to his face and eye from an artillery shell, and a gunshot wound to his right cheek. He spent three days in hospital before returning to his battalion. On 22 June, he was once again promoted to lance corporal. The 3rd Pioneer Battalion spent the next four months in a quieter section of the front.

As part of the third stage of General <a href="Herbert%20Plumer%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Plumer">Sir Herbert Plumer's</a> <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Passchendaele offensive</a>, an attack against Broodseinde was scheduled for 4 October 1917. The <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">3rd Australian Division</a>'s <a href="10th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">10th Australian Infantry Brigade</a> was one of the assault formations charged with delivering the main blow, and ultimately with seizing the heavily defended Broodseinde Ridge. To provide defence against low-flying German aircraft during the attack, a group of 24 men, including Peeler, from the 3rd Pioneer Battalion's machine gun section were attached to the 10th Brigade's 37th Battalion.

The <a href="Battle%20of%20Broodseinde">attack on Broodseinde</a> began at 06:00 under the cover of an artillery barrage. Armed with a Lewis Gun, Peeler advanced with the initial wave. The Australians rapidly crossed the first before becoming pinned down by a party of nine German soldiers, who were situated in a shellhole and sniping at the advancing troops. Firing his machine gun from the hip, Peeler dashed forward across the exposed ground and shot the group of Germans, "clearing the way for the advance". He performed similar feats on two subsequent occasions, killing several German soldiers and emerging unscathed.

The Australian force continued to press their assault, encountering pillboxes and machine gun positions as they pushed forward. One such machine gun position, situated in the open, held up the advance. Firing a single burst from his Lewis Gun, Peeler killed the gunner and caused the remainder of the gun's defenders to seek cover in a nearby dugout. One of the Australians then lobbed a "well aimed" grenade into the dugout, driving out ten soldiers whom Peeler then shot. Described as being "particularly prominent in the advance" by historian <a href="Charles%20Bean">Charles Bean</a>, Peeler "almost single-handedly" destroyed four German posts in an hour, accounting for more than 30 soldiers.

By 07:15 the following morning, the 37th Battalion had captured its objective, having seized eight pillboxes, several concrete dugouts, 20 machine guns and 420 <a href="Prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners</a>. Two hours later, the Australians were in possession of Broodseinde Ridge. For his actions during the battle, Peeler was awarded the Victoria Cross; one of two Australians to be so decorated that day. On 12 October, eight days after Peeler's actions, the men of the 10th Brigade returned to the front line in an effort to exploit the success of the previous week. The ground in front of their position was dominated by a series of German pillboxes and had been turned into a <a href="Bog">quagmire</a> by heavy rain. The brigade's attack was soon subject to a "torrent of machine gun fire", and Peeler was severely wounded in his right arm. Initially evacuated to the 11th Australian Field Ambulance casualty station, it was decided that his wound necessitated treatment in England so he embarked for the Northampton War Hospital on 15 October, arriving the following day.

While recuperating in England, the announcement and accompanying citation for Peeler's Victoria Cross was promulgated in a supplement to the "London Gazette" on 26 November 1917, reading:

As news of Peeler's decoration spread, it prompted a "wave of celebrations" in his hometown of Castlemaine; flags flew in his honour, and one of his daughters was cheered by fellow pupils at her school. On 8 January 1918, Peeler was formally conferred with his Victoria Cross by <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George V</a> in an investiture ceremony at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>. Having sufficiently recovered from his wound, Peeler rejoined the 3rd Pioneer Battalion in France on 17 May; he was promoted to temporary <a href="corporal">corporal</a> two weeks later.

On 22 June 1918, Peeler was posted to the Corps Gas School for eight days. He was promoted to <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a> on 30 July. Around this time, <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Australian Prime Minister</a> <a href="Billy%20Hughes">Billy Hughes</a> invited Australia's Victoria Cross recipients of the war to return to Australia and assist in a recruiting drive. Among the group who accepted the offer, Peeler was one of ten who embarked for Melbourne aboard HMAT "Medic" on 24 August, arriving in Melbourne seven weeks later. He would not return to France; on 11 November 1918 an <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany%20%28Compi%C3%A8gne%29">armistice with Germany</a> was declared, effectively ending the war. Peeler was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 10 December.

Following his discharge, Peeler gained employment with the soldier-settler branch of the Victorian Department of Lands. He remained with the department for six years, before acquiring an orchard in the Castlemaine district. However, this venture proved short-lived and he soon returned with his family to Melbourne, joining the <a href="H.V.%20McKay">H.V. McKay</a> <a href="Sunshine%20Harvester%20Works">Sunshine Harvester Works</a> at <a href="Sunshine%2C%20Victoria">Sunshine</a>. Also on the company's staff was a fellow Victoria Cross recipient, <a href="Dominic%20McCarthy">Dominic McCarthy</a>. When Melbourne's <a href="Shrine%20of%20Remembrance">Shrine of Remembrance</a> was completed in 1934, Peeler was appointed as the memorial's first custodian. He occupied this post for next 30 years, coming to regard the Shrine as "his second home".

On 27 May 1940, Peeler enlisted in the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a> for service in the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, giving his date of birth on his enlistment forms as 9 August 1901, thus understating his age by fourteen years. At 52, Peeler was twelve years over the maximum age limit, although he later claimed he was not the "oldest fellow in my unit". Granted the acting rank of sergeant, he was allotted to the newly raised <a href="2/2nd%20Pioneer%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/2nd Pioneer Battalion</a>. The battalion completed its initial training at <a href="Puckapunyal">Puckapunyal</a>,<ref name="2/2nd"></ref> during which time Peeler was made acting <a href="staff%20sergeant">staff sergeant</a> and Company Quartermaster Sergeant of D Company on 1 August.

On 7 April 1941, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion embarked aboard <a href="RMS%20Queen%20Mary">HMT "Queen Mary"</a> at <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, bound for the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>; Peeler's rank of staff sergeant was confirmed as substantive on the same day. After just under four weeks at sea, the troopship disembarked at Port Tewfik in <a href="Suez">Suez</a>, where the battalion entrained for <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">Palestine</a>. There it was attached to the <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">7th Division</a> in support of the <a href="Syria-Lebanon%20Campaign">Syrian campaign</a> against <a href="Vichy%20French">Vichy French</a> forces.

The 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion was initially divided up, with each company attached to a different brigade of the 7th Division. Peeler's D Company—assigned to the <a href="25th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">25th Brigade</a>—was originally tasked with the maintenance and general repair of the road network in its locality. However, when the Vichy French launched a counter-attack on 15 June, the battalion was concentrated in the Merdjayoun area in an effort to prevent any further French gains. On the night of 27 June, after a <a href="Battle%20of%20Merdjayoun">costly assault against the Vichy French</a> at Merdjayoun earlier that day, Peeler led out a patrol to recover the wounded. Four soldiers were discovered and brought back to the Australian lines. Despite suffering heavy casualties in Syria, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion served throughout the campaign, including participation in the decisive <a href="Battle%20of%20Damour">Battle of Damour</a> in July.

After the Vichy French defeat in Syria, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion was relocated to <a href="Tripoli%2C%20Lebanon">Tripoli, Lebanon</a> where it headquartered itself in an olive grove while carrying out training and garrison duties over the next four months. During November, the battalion was moved to <a href="Qatana">Qatana</a> in Syria, but with the entry of <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japan</a> into the war in late 1941, the 1st Australian Corps including the <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">6th</a> and 7th Divisions were directed to move to the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Netherlands East Indies</a> for service in the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific theatre</a>. In January 1942, Peeler was among the men of the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion who embarked aboard <a href="SS%20Orcades%20%281937%29">HMT "Orcades"</a> for Sumatra but later diverted to Java. He was promoted to <a href="Warrant%20officer%23Australia">Warrant Officer Class II</a> during this time.

With the rapid Japanese advance through the Pacific and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Singapore">fall of Singapore</a> in February 1942, the 3,400 troops aboard "Orcades" were diverted from <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> to <a href="Java">Java</a> in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>. Disembarking at <a href="Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Batavia</a> on 18 February, Peeler's battalion was combined with the other units aboard "Orcades" to form Blackforce. This ad hoc grouping, under the command of fellow Victoria Cross holder Brigadier <a href="Arthur%20Blackburn">Arthur Blackburn</a>, was tasked with defending a series of airfields and supporting the Dutch. Blackburn organised his men into a brigade formation, consisting of a headquarters and three infantry battalions—the men of the 2/2nd Pioneers made up the bulk of Blackforce's 2nd Battalion.

On 28 February 1942, elements of the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> landed on Java. Blackforce was stationed at <a href="Buitenzorg">Buitenzorg</a>, poised to advance west to confront the invaders. However, rapid Japanese progress pushed the defending Dutch forces in the opposite direction, and Blackforce was assigned the defence of Buitenzorg and <a href="Subdistricts%20of%20West%20Java">Leuwiliang</a>. As the situation deteriorated further, Blackburn was forced to withdraw his men east on the night of 4/5 March, and again on 7/8 March. On 8 March, the Dutch surrendered, ordering all men to lay down their arms. With supplies running low and unable to contact the <a href="Australian%20Government">Australian Government</a>, Brigadier Blackburn announced the surrender of Blackforce four days later. Peeler and his fellow soldiers thus became prisoners of war. At the time, he was one of three Australian Victoria Cross recipients of the First World War serving overseas, all of whom were "swept up in the Japanese advance"; Blackburn surrendered with Peeler at Java, while <a href="Walter%20Brown%20%28VC%29">Walter Brown</a> was caught up in the fall of Singapore, where he is believed to have been killed attempting to evade capture.

Peeler was among a contingent of Australian captives transported to work on the <a href="Burma%20Railway">Burma Railway</a>. Despite the "harsh treatment" meted out by the Japanese, he later played down his ordeal, stating: "I wasn't treated too badly, apart from nearly starving ... But what the Japs did to the others on the railway was pretty horrifying". After three-and-a-half years incarceration, he was freed following the Japanese capitulation in August 1945 and the subsequent liberation of prisoner-of-war camps in the Pacific. On 6 October, Peeler embarked for Australia aboard HMS "Highland Brigade"; he arrived in Melbourne fifteen days later. Back in Australia, he learned that his son, Donald, by his second marriage, had been killed in action on the island of <a href="Bougainville%20Island">Bougainville</a> on 31 December 1944, while serving with the 15th Battalion. Donald Peeler was <a href="Posthumous%20recognition">posthumously</a> <a href="Mentioned%20in%20Despatches">Mentioned in Despatches</a> for his "distinguished service in the South-West Pacific Area". Warrant Officer Class II Walter Peeler was discharged from the Second Australian Imperial Force on 12 December 1945.

Peeler resumed his duties as custodian of the Shrine of Remembrance on his discharge, guiding visitors around the memorial. In the 1961 <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">Queen's Birthday Honours</a>, his "long and dedicated service" at the Shrine was recognised with the award of the <a href="British%20Empire%20Medal">British Empire Medal</a>. He retired three years later at the age of 76, stating: "It's time I had a rest." In 1966, Peeler was interviewed for a newspaper article; when queried on his Victoria Cross exploit, he recalled:

On 23 May 1968, Peeler died at his home in <a href="Caulfield%20South%2C%20Victoria">South Caulfield</a>, Victoria. Survived by his second wife, Kathleen, his first wife Emma pre deceased him in 1964, and his four remaining children, one by his first wife and three by his second, he was buried in <a href="Brighton%20Cemetery">Brighton Cemetery</a>. Kathleen died the following year. Peeler is commemorated in the Victorian Garden of Remembrance, and a soldiers' club in <a href="Casula%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Casula, New South Wales</a>, bears his name. His Victoria Cross and other medals are on display in the Hall of Valour at the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>.

Robert Garran

Sir Robert Randolph Garran (10 February 1867 – 11 January 1957) was an Australian lawyer who became "Australia's first public servant" – the first <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">federal government</a> employee after the <a href="Federation%20of%20Australia">federation of the Australian colonies</a>. He served as the <a href="departmental%20secretary">departmental secretary</a> of the <a href="Attorney-General%27s%20Department%20%28Australia%29">Attorney-General's Department</a> from 1901 to 1932, and after 1916 also held the position of <a href="Solicitor-General%20of%20Australia">Solicitor-General of Australia</a>.

Garran was born in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, the son of the journalist and politician <a href="Andrew%20Garran">Andrew Garran</a>. He studied arts and law at the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a> and was <a href="call%20to%20the%20bar">called to the bar</a> in 1891. Garran was a keen supporter of the federation movement, and became acquainted with leading federalists like <a href="George%20Reid">George Reid</a> and <a href="Edmund%20Barton">Edmund Barton</a>. At the <a href="Constitutional%20Convention%20%28Australia%29">1897–98 constitutional convention</a> he served as secretary of the drafting committee. On 1 January 1901, Garran was chosen by Barton's <a href="caretaker%20government">caretaker government</a> as its first employee; for a brief period, he was the only member of the <a href="Commonwealth%20Public%20Service">Commonwealth Public Service</a>. His first duty was to write the inaugural edition of the "<a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Australia%20Gazette">Commonwealth Gazette</a>", which contained <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s proclamation authorising the creation of a federal government.

Over the following three decades, Garran provided legal advice to ten different <a href="Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Australia">prime ministers</a>, from Barton to <a href="Joseph%20Lyons">Joseph Lyons</a>. He was considered an early expert in <a href="Australian%20constitutional%20law">Australian constitutional law</a>, and with <a href="John%20Quick%20%28politician%29">John Quick</a> published an annotated edition of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Australia">constitution</a> that became a standard reference work. Garran developed a close relationship with <a href="Billy%20Hughes">Billy Hughes</a> during World War I, and accompanied him to the <a href="Imperial%20War%20Cabinet">Imperial War Cabinet</a> and the <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Conference%2C%201919">Paris Peace Conference</a>. Hughes, who was simultaneously prime minister and <a href="Attorney-General%20of%20Australia">attorney-general</a>, appointed him to the new position of solicitor-general and delegated numerous powers and responsibilities to him. He received two knighthoods for his work, one in 1917 and one in 1920.

In addition to his professional work, Garran was also an important figure in the development of the city of <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> during its early years. He was one of the first public servants to relocate there after it replaced <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> as the capital in 1927. He founded several important cultural associations, organised the creation of the <a href="Canberra%20University%20College">Canberra University College</a>, and later contributed to the establishment of the <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a>. Garran published at least eight books and many journal articles throughout his lifetime, covering such topics as constitutional law, the history of <a href="federalism">federalism</a> in Australia, and German-language poetry. He was granted a <a href="state%20funeral">state funeral</a> upon his death in 1957, the first federal public servant to receive one.

Garran was born in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, the only son (among seven children) of journalist and politician <a href="Andrew%20Garran">Andrew Garran</a> and his wife Mary Isham. His parents were committed to <a href="social%20justice">social justice</a>, Mary campaigning for issues such as the promotion of education for women, and Andrew advocating <a href="Federation%20of%20Australia">Federation</a> and covering reformist movements as editor of "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" and later promoting them as a member of the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Legislative%20Council">New South Wales Legislative Council</a>.

The family lived in <a href="Phillip%20Street%2C%20Sydney">Phillip Street</a> in central Sydney. Garran's mother "had a deep distrust, well justified in those days, of milkman's milk" and so she kept a <a href="cow">cow</a> in the backyard, which would walk on its own to <a href="The%20Domain%2C%20Sydney">The Domain</a> each day to graze and return twice a day to be milked. The Garrans later lived in the suburb of <a href="Darlinghurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Darlinghurst</a>, just to the east of the centre of the city.

Garran attended <a href="Sydney%20Grammar%20School">Sydney Grammar School</a> from the age of ten, starting in 1877. He was a successful student, and became <a href="School%20Captain">School Captain</a> in 1884. He then studied arts and law at the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a>, where he was awarded <a href="scholarship">scholarship</a>s for classics, mathematics and general academic ability. Garran graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree with first-class honours in 1888, winning the University's Medal in Philosophy, and a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1889.

After graduating, Garran began to study for the Bar examination. He was employed for a year with a firm of Sydney <a href="solicitor">solicitor</a>s, and the next year served as associate to Justice <a href="William%20Charles%20Windeyer">William Charles Windeyer</a> of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Supreme Court of New South Wales</a>. Windeyer had a reputation for being a harsh and inflexible judge, particularly in criminal cases, where he was said to have "a rigorous and unrelenting sense of the retribution that he believed criminal justice demanded, [and] a sympathy verging on the emotional for the victims of crime." Garran however offered a different view, saying that "those who knew him well knew that under a brusque exterior he was the kindest of men", and his reputation had to some degree been created by misrepresentation. In 1891, Garran was admitted to the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Bar">New South Wales Bar</a>, where he commenced practice as a <a href="barrister">barrister</a>, primarily working in <a href="Equity%20%28law%29">equity</a>.

Garran, like his father, was strongly involved in the <a href="Federation%20of%20Australia">Australian Federation movement</a>, the movement which sought to unite the <a href="British%20colonies">British colonies</a> in Australia (and, in early proposals, New Zealand) into one <a href="federation">federated</a> <a href="country">country</a>. The first <a href="Constitutional%20Convention%20%28Australia%29">Constitutional Convention</a> was held in 1891 in the chamber of the <a href="Legislative%20Council%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Legislative Council of New South Wales</a> in <a href="Macquarie%20Street%2C%20Sydney">Macquarie Street, Sydney</a>, around the corner from Garran's chambers in Phillip Street; Garran regularly attended and sat in the public gallery to see "history... in the making under my very eyes." Garran would later recall with approval that the 1891 convention was the first with the courage to face the "lion in the path", the issue of <a href="customs">customs</a> duties and <a href="tariff">tariff</a>s, which had previously divided states such as <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, who were in favour of <a href="protectionism">protectionism</a>, and states such as <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, who were in favour of <a href="free%20trade">free trade</a>. In Garran's view a clause proposed at the convention, which allowed for tariffs against international trade while ensuring free trade domestically (the predecessor to the final <a href="section%2092%20of%20the%20Constitution%20of%20Australia">section 92 of the Constitution of Australia</a>), "expressed the terms on which New South Wales was prepared to face the lion."

Garran became involved with the work of <a href="Edmund%20Barton">Edmund Barton</a>, who would later be the first <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a> but at the time was the "<a href="de%20facto">de facto</a>" leader of the federation movement in New South Wales as Sir <a href="Henry%20Parkes">Henry Parkes</a> declined into poor health. Garran, along with others such as <a href="Atlee%20Hunt">Atlee Hunt</a>, worked essentially as secretaries to Barton's federation campaign, drafting correspondence and planning meetings. At one late night meeting, planning a speech Barton was to give in the Sydney suburb of <a href="Ashfield%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Ashfield</a>, Barton coined the phrase "For the first time, we have a nation for a continent, and a continent for a nation"; Garran recalled that the now famous phrase "would have been unrecorded if I had not happened to jot it down."

In June 1893, when the <a href="Australasian%20Federal%20League">Australasian Federal League</a> was formed at a meeting in the <a href="Sydney%20Town%20Hall">Sydney Town Hall</a>, Garran joined immediately and was made a member of the executive committee. He was one of the League's four delegates to the 1893 <a href="Corowa%20Conference">Corowa Conference</a> and a League delegate to the 1896 <a href="Bathurst%20Conference">Bathurst Conference</a>, informal conferences held between members of the League (primarily based in Sydney), the <a href="Australian%20Natives%27%20Association">Australian Natives' Association</a> (mainly Victorian) and other pro-federation groups. At Corowa he was part of an impromptu group organised by <a href="John%20Quick%20%28politician%29">John Quick</a> which drafted a resolution, passed at the Conference, calling on the colonial parliaments to hold a directly elected <a href="Constitutional%20Convention%20%28Australia%29">Constitutional Convention</a> to be charged with drafting the Bill for the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Australia">Constitution of Australia</a>. The proposal, which came to be known as the Corowa Plan, was later accepted at the 1895 Premiers' Conference and formed the basis for the federation process over the following five years.

In 1897, Garran published "The Coming Commonwealth", an influential book on the history of the Federation movement and the debate over the 1891 draft of the Constitution of Australia. The book was based on material he prepared for a course on <a href="federalism">federalism</a> and federal systems of government, which he had planned to give at the University of Sydney, but which failed to attract a sufficient number of students. Nevertheless, the book was both unique and popular, as one of the few books on the topic at the time, with the first edition quickly selling out. Soon after its publication the <a href="Premier%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Premier of New South Wales</a> <a href="George%20Reid%20%28Australian%20politician%29">George Reid</a>, who had been elected as a New South Wales delegate to the 1897–1898 Constitutional Convention, invited Garran to be his secretary. At the Convention, Reid appointed him secretary of the Drafting Committee, at Barton's request; he was also a member of the Press Committee.

Garran recorded in a letter to his family during the convention's <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> sitting that:

The committee professes to find me very useful in unravelling the conundrums sent down by the finance committee... The last two nights I have found the drafting committee fagged [tired] and despairing, and now they have pitched the conundrums at me and gone out for a smoke; and then I worked out <a href="algebra">algebra</a>ic formulas to clear the thing up, drafted clauses accordingly, and when the committee returned we had plain sailing.

Garran joked that the long work of the drafting committee breached the "<a href="Factory%20Acts">Factory Acts</a>", the group (primarily Barton, <a href="Richard%20O%27Connor%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Richard O'Connor</a>, <a href="John%20Downer">John Downer</a> and Garran) often working late into the night preparing drafts for the convention to consider and debate the next morning. On the evening before the convention's last day, Barton had gone to bed exhausted in the small hours, Garran and <a href="Charles%20Gavan%20Duffy">Charles Gavan Duffy</a> finishing the final schedule of amendments at breakfast time. The convention concluded successfully, approving a final draft which would ultimately, aside from a small amendment arranged at the last minute in <a href="London">London</a>, become the Constitution of Australia.

Throughout 1898, following the completion of the proposed Constitution, Garran participated in the campaign promoting Federation leading up to the referendums at which the people of the colonies voted whether or not to approve the Constitution. He contributed a daily column to the "<a href="Evening%20News%20%28Sydney%29">Evening News</a>", and had humorous poems critiquing opponents of federation published in "<a href="The%20Bulletin%20%28Australian%20periodical%29">The Bulletin</a>". The following year, he began working with Quick on the "Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth", a reference work on the Constitution including a history, and detailed discussion of each section analysing its meaning and its development at the Conventions. Published in 1901, the "Annotated Constitution", commonly referred to simply as "Quick & Garran", soon became the standard work on the Constitution and is still regarded as one of the most important works on the subject.

On the day that Federation was completed and Australia created, 1 January 1901, Garran was made a Commander of the <a href="Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">Order of St Michael and St George</a> (CMG) "in recognition of services in connection with the Federation of Australian Colonies and the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia", and was appointed secretary and Permanent Head of the <a href="Attorney-General%27s%20Department%20%28Australia%29">Attorney-General's Department</a> by the first <a href="Attorney-General%20of%20Australia">Attorney-General of Australia</a>, <a href="Alfred%20Deakin">Alfred Deakin</a>. Garran was the first, and for a time the only, public servant employed by the <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">Government of Australia</a>. Garran later said of this time that:

I was not only the head [of the department], but the tail. I was my own clerk and messenger. My first duty was to write out with my own hand <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Australia%20Gazette">Commonwealth Gazette</a> No. 1 proclaiming the establishment of the Commonwealth and the appointment of ministers of state, and to send myself down with it to the government printer.
In this role, Garran was responsible for organising the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201901">first federal election</a> in March 1901, and for organising the transfer of various government departments from <a href="states%20and%20territories%20of%20Australia">the states</a> to the federal government, including the <a href="Department%20of%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Department of Defence</a>, the <a href="mail">postal</a> and <a href="telegraph">telegraph</a>ic services (now part of the <a href="Department%20of%20Communications%2C%20Information%20Technology%20and%20the%20Arts%20%28Australia%29">Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</a>) and the Department of Trade and Customs (now part of the <a href="Department%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20and%20Trade%20%28Australia%29">Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</a>). As parliamentary drafter, Garran also developed legislation to administer those new departments and other important legislation.

Garran and his fellow staff aimed for a simple style of legislative drafting, a goal enabled by the fact that there was no pre-existing federal legislation on which their work would have to be based. In Garran's opinion the approach, which was put into practice many years before the similarly principled <a href="plain%20English">plain English</a> movement became popular in government in the 1970s, was intended "to set an example of clear, straightforward language, free from technical <a href="jargon">jargon</a>." Subsequent parliamentary drafters have noted that Garran was unusual in this respect for deliberately setting out to achieve and improve a particular drafting style, and that it was not until the early 1980s that such discipline among drafters re-emerged.

However, Garran himself admitted that his drafting could be overly simplistic, citing the first customs and excise legislation (the "<a href="Customs%20Act%201901">Customs Act 1901</a>" and the "<a href="Excise%20Act%201901">Excise Act 1901</a>"), developed with the Minister for Trade and Customs <a href="Charles%20Kingston">Charles Kingston</a>, as an example of the style taken to excess. The style was also once <a href="parody">parodied</a> by foundation <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Court</a> Justice <a href="Richard%20O%27Connor%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Richard O'Connor</a> as follows:

Every man shall wear –
  (a) Coat
  (b) Vest
  (c) Trousers
Penalty: £100.
In 1902, Garran married Hilda Robson. Together they would have four sons, Richard (born 1903), John (1905), Andrew (1906) and Isham Peter (1910). At this time the family lived in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, and the boys all attended <a href="Melbourne%20Grammar%20School">Melbourne Grammar School</a> and later studied at the <a href="University%20of%20Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a>, attending <a href="Trinity%20College%20%28University%20of%20Melbourne%29">Trinity College</a> there.

The Attorney-General's Department also managed <a href="litigation">litigation</a> on behalf of the government. Initially the department contracted private <a href="law%20firm">law firm</a>s to actually conduct the litigation, but in 1903 the office of the <a href="Commonwealth%20Crown%20Solicitor">Commonwealth Crown Solicitor</a> was established, with <a href="Charles%20Powers">Charles Powers</a> the first to hold the job. The other Crown Solicitors that Garran worked with included <a href="Gordon%20Castle">Gordon Castle</a> (with whom he had also worked as a drafter) and <a href="William%20Sharwood">William Sharwood</a>.

Garran worked with several Attorneys-General as Permanent Head of the Department. Garran regarded the first Attorney-General, Alfred Deakin, as an excellent thinker and a natural lawyer, and on occasion "[spoke] of Deakin as the <a href="Arthur%20Balfour">Balfour</a> of Australian politics." He was also very much impressed with the fifth Attorney-General, <a href="Isaac%20Isaacs">Isaac Isaacs</a>, who was an extremely diligent worker, and two time Attorney-General <a href="Littleton%20Groom">Littleton Groom</a>, who was "probably one of the most useful Ministers the Commonwealth has had."

In 1912, Garran was considered as a possible appointee to the High Court, following the expansion of the bench from five seats to seven and the death of Richard O'Connor. <a href="Billy%20Hughes">Billy Hughes</a>, Attorney-General in the <a href="Andrew%20Fisher">Fisher</a> government at the time, later said Garran would have been appointed "but for the fact that he is too valuable a man for us to lose. We cannot spare him."

In 1916, Garran was made the first <a href="Solicitor-General%20of%20Australia">Solicitor-General of Australia</a> (the office was then known as Commonwealth Solicitor-General) by Billy Hughes, who had since become Prime Minister. The creation of the office and Garran's appointment to it was to some degree recognition of his existing role as Permanent Head of the Attorney-General's Department, in which Garran gave legal advice to several successive governments, but it also represented a formal delegation of many of the powers and functions formerly exercised by the Attorney-General.

Garran developed a strong relationship with Hughes, giving him legal advice on the <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> <a href="Conscription%20in%20Australia%23World%20War%20I">conscription plebiscites</a> and on the range of <a href="regulation">regulation</a>s which were made under the "<a href="War%20Precautions%20Act%201914">War Precautions Act 1914</a>". The "War Precautions Regulations" had a broad scope, and were generally supported by the High Court, which adopted a much more flexible approach to the reach of the Commonwealth's <a href="Section%2051%28vi%29%20of%20the%20Australian%20Constitution">defence power</a> during wartime. A substantial amount of Garran's work during the war involved preparing and carrying out the regulations. Many of them were directed at maximising the economic aspect of the war effort and ensuring supplies of goods to Australian troops; others were directed at controlling citizens or former citizens of the enemy <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a> living in Australia. On one occasion, when Hughes had been informed that at a party hosted by a <a href="Germans">German</a> man, the band had played "<a href="Das%20Lied%20der%20Deutschen">Das Lied der Deutschen</a>", Hughes asked Garran "By the way, what is this tune?" to which Garran replied that it was <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Haydn</a>'s melody to "<a href="Gott%20erhalte%20Franz%20den%20Kaiser">Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser</a>", and as it was used as the tune to several <a href="hymn">hymn</a>s "it was probably sung in half a dozen churches in Sydney last Sunday." Hughes then said "Good Heavens! I have played that thing with one finger hundreds of times."

The partnership between Garran and Hughes is regarded by some as unusual, given that Garran was "tall, gentlemanly, wise and scholarly", and patient with his staff, whereas Hughes was "short of stature [and] renowned for bursts of temper." Nevertheless, the partnership was a successful one, with Hughes recognising the importance of Garran's constitutional expertise, remarking once about the World War I period that "the best way to govern Australia was to have Sir Robert Garran at [my] elbow, with a fountain pen and a blank sheet of paper, and the "War Precautions Act"." Likewise, Garran respected Hughes' strong leadership style, which had been important in guiding the country through the war, although in describing the <a href="Nationalist%20Party%20of%20Australia">Nationalist Party</a>'s loss in the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201922">1922 federal election</a>, Garran later said that "Hughes also overestimated his own hold on Parliament [although] his hold on the people was probably undiminished."

Garran accompanied Hughes and <a href="Joseph%20Cook">Joseph Cook</a> (then the Minister for the Navy) to the 1917 and 1918 meetings of the <a href="Imperial%20War%20Cabinet">Imperial War Cabinet</a> in <a href="London">London</a>, United Kingdom, and was also part of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> delegation to the 1919 <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Conference%2C%201919">Paris Peace Conference</a> in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, France. There he was on several of the treaty drafting committees, and contributed to many provisions, notably the portions of the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> Covenant relating to <a href="League%20of%20Nations%20mandate">League of Nations mandate</a>s. Though focusing mainly on League of Nations matters, Garran and <a href="John%20Latham%20%28Australian%20jurist%29">John Latham</a> (the head of Australian Naval Intelligence) had the status of technical advisers to Hughes and Cook, and so could attend the main conference and any of the associated councils. Observing the proceedings, Garran admired the "moral and physical courage" of French premier <a href="Georges%20Clemenceau">Georges Clemenceau</a>, whom he regarded as determined to protect France from Germany but in a measured and temperate way; in Garran's words, Clemenceau "always withstood the excessive demands of the French chauvinists, of the French army, and of <a href="Ferdinand%20Foch">Foch</a> himself." Garran viewed some similarities between <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British Prime Minister</a> <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a> and <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States President</a> <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> where others saw only differences, since Lloyd George "also had a strong vein of idealism in his character", and Wilson could be pragmatic when the situation called for it, such as in discussions relating to American interests. Garran also met other political and military leaders at the conference, including <a href="T.%20E.%20Lawrence">T. E. Lawrence</a>, "an <a href="Jesus%20College%2C%20Oxford">Oxford</a> youth of 29 – he looks 18", who was modest and "without any affectation... in a company of two or three [he] could talk very interestingly, but at a larger gathering he was apt to be dumb."

Following the war, Garran worked with Professor <a href="Harrison%20Moore">Harrison Moore</a> of the University of Melbourne and <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>n judge Professor <a href="William%20Jethro%20Brown">Jethro Brown</a> on a report about proposed constitutional amendments which ultimately became the referendum questions put forward in the <a href="Australian%20referendum%2C%201919">1919 referendum</a>. Garran had been made a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">Knight Bachelor</a> in 1917 and was appointed as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1920. Garran attended two <a href="Imperial%20Conference">Imperial Conference</a>s, accompanying Prime Minister <a href="Stanley%20Bruce">Stanley Bruce</a> in 1923 and in 1930 joining Prime Minister <a href="James%20Scullin">James Scullin</a> and Attorney-General <a href="Frank%20Brennan%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Frank Brennan</a>, chair of the Drafting Committee which prepared drafts of agreements on various topics, such as <a href="merchant%20shipping">merchant shipping</a>. He also attended the eleventh League of Nations conference that year with them in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. At the <a href="Royal%20Commission%20on%20the%20Constitution%20%28Australia%29">Royal Commission on the Constitution</a> in 1927, Garran was invited to give evidence by Prime Minister Bruce, where he discussed the history and origins of the Constitution and the evolution of the institutions established under it.

Through the 1920s and early 1930s, Garran prepared annual summaries of legislative developments in Australia, highlighting important individual pieces of legislation for the "Journal of Comparative Legislation and International Law" (now known as the "<a href="International%20and%20Comparative%20Law%20Quarterly">International and Comparative Law Quarterly</a>") published by <a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a>.

Towards the end of his time as Solicitor-General, Garran's work included the preparation of the Debt Conversion Agreement between the Government of Australia and the governments of <a href="states%20and%20territories%20of%20Australia">the states</a>, which involved the federal government taking over and managing the debts of the individual states, following the <a href="Australian%20referendum%2C%201928">1928 referendum</a>. In 1930, he was asked by the <a href="James%20Scullin">Scullin Government</a> to provide an opinion on whether <a href="Norman%20Lindsay">Norman Lindsay</a>'s novel "<a href="Redheap">Redheap</a>" was indecent and obscene within the terms of section 52(c) of the "Customs Act 1901". He concluded that it was, and the <a href="Department%20of%20Trade%20and%20Customs%20%28Australia%29">Department of Trade and Customs</a> subsequently banned the book from being imported into Australia, the first book by an Australian author to suffer such a ban. It has been suggested that <a href="Frank%20Forde">Frank Forde</a>, the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs, had already decided to ban the book, and sought Garran's advice primarily as a buffer against political criticism.

In 1927, Garran had moved from his home in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> to the newly established capital <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>, one of the first public officials to do so (many government departments and their public servants did not move to Canberra until after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>). He also worked within the Government to facilitate housing in Canberra for officials moving from other cities, and was involved in establishing cultural organisations in the city. In 1928 he was the inaugural President of the Canberra <a href="Rotary%20International">Rotary Club</a>. In 1929, he formed the <a href="Canberra%20University%20Association">Canberra University Association</a> in order to promote the formation of a university in Canberra, and in 1930 organised the establishment of <a href="Canberra%20University%20College">Canberra University College</a> (essentially a campus of the <a href="University%20of%20Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a>) which taught undergraduate courses, chairing its council for its first twenty-three years. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Garran "consistently advocated the establishment of what he prophetically called 'a National University at Canberra' ", which would be primarily for specialist research and <a href="postgraduate">postgraduate</a> study, in areas particularly relating to Australia, such as foreign relations with Asia and the Pacific region. This vision was evidently influential on the establishment of the <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a> (ANU) in 1946, the only research-only university in the country (although in 1960 it amalgamated with Canberra University College to offer undergraduate courses).

Garran retired from his governmental positions on 9 February 1932, a fixed retirement date on the day before his sixty-fifth birthday. He soon returned to practise as a barrister, and within a month he was made a <a href="King%27s%20Counsel">King's Counsel</a> (KC). However, he occasionally carried out more prominent work. In 1932, he was selected on the advice of now Attorney-General John Latham to chair the <a href="Indian%20Defence%20Expenditure%20Tribunal">Indian Defence Expenditure Tribunal</a>, to advise on the dispute between India and the United Kingdom regarding the costs of the military defence of India. In 1934, along with <a href="John%20Keating%20%28Australian%20politician%29">John Keating</a>, <a href="William%20Somerville%20%28Australian%20politician%29">William Somerville</a> and <a href="David%20John%20Gilbert">David John Gilbert</a>, he formed a committee which prepared "The Case for Union", the <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">Government of Australia</a>'s official reply to <a href="Secessionism%20in%20Western%20Australia">the secessionist movement</a> in the state of <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>.

Garran was also involved with the arts; he was the vice-president of the Canberra Musical Society, where he sang and played the <a href="clarinet">clarinet</a>, and in 1946 won a national song competition run by the <a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a>. Garran also published translations of <a href="Heinrich%20Heine">Heinrich Heine</a>'s 1827 work "Buch der Lieder" ("Book of Songs") in 1924, and of the works of <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Franz Schubert</a> and <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Robert Schumann</a> in 1946.

In 1937, Garran was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG), the third time he had been knighted. Shortly after the establishment of the ANU in 1946, Garran became its first graduate when he was awarded an <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary doctorate</a> of laws. He had already been awarded such an honorary doctorate from the University of Melbourne in 1937 and later receiving one from his <a href="alma%20mater">alma mater</a>, the University of Sydney in 1952. Garran served on ANU's council from 1946 until 1951. Garran's influence on Canberra is remembered by the naming of the suburb of <a href="Garran%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Garran, Australian Capital Territory</a>, and his link with ANU is remembered by the naming of a <a href="chair%20%28official%29">chair</a> in the university's School of Law, by the naming of the hall of residence <a href="Burton%20%26amp%3B%20Garran%20Hall">Burton & Garran Hall</a> and by the naming of Garran house at <a href="Canberra%20Grammar%20School">Canberra Grammar School</a> for his work with that school.

Garran died in 1957 in Canberra. He was granted a <a href="state%20funeral">state funeral</a>, the first given to a public servant of the Government of Australia. He was survived by his four sons; his wife Hilda had died in 1936. His <a href="memoir">memoir</a>s, "Prosper the Commonwealth", were published posthumously in 1958, having been completed shortly before his death.

Garran's "personality, like his prose, was devoid of pedantry and pomposity and, though dignified, was laced with a quizzical turn of humour." His death "marked the end of a generation of public men for whom the cultural and the political were natural extensions of each other and who had the skills and talents to make such connections effortlessly." At his death, Garran was one of the last remaining of the people involved with the creation of the Constitution of Australia.

Former Prime Minister <a href="John%20Howard">John Howard</a>, in describing Garran, said:

"I wonder though if we sometimes underestimate the changes, excitements, disruptions and adjustments previous generations have experienced. Sir Robert Garran knew the promise and reality of federation. He was part of the establishment of a public service which, in many ways, is clearly recognisable today."
Garran's friend <a href="Charles%20Daley">Charles Daley</a>, a long time civic administrator of the <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Australian Capital Territory</a>, emphasised Garran's contribution to the early development of the city of Canberra, particularly its cultural life, remarking at a celebratory dinner for Garran in 1954 that:

"There has hardly been a cultural movement in this city with which Sir Robert has not been identified in loyal and inspiring support, as his constant aim has been that Canberra should be not only a great political centre but also a shrine to foster those things that stimulate and enrich our national life... his name will ever be inscribed in the annals, not only of Canberra, but of the Commonwealth as "clarum et venerabile nomen gentibus".
However Garran is perhaps best remembered as an expert on constitutional law, more so than for his other contributions to public service. On his experience of Federation and the Constitution, Garran was always enthusiastic:

"I'm often asked 'has federation turned out as you expected?' Well yes and no. By and large the sort of thing we expected has happened but with differences. We knew the constitution was not perfect; it had to be a compromise with all the faults of a compromise... But, in spite of the unforeseen [sic] strains and stresses, the constitution has worked, on the whole, much as we thought it would. I think it now needs revision, to meet the needs of a changed world. But no-one could wish the work undone, who tries to imagine, what, in these stormy days, would have been the plight of six disunited Australian colonies."
The <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> suburb of <a href="Garran%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Garran</a>, established in 1966, was named after him.

In 1983, the former Patent Office building - now occupied by the Federal Attorney General's Department - was renamed Robert Garran Offices. The <a href="art%20deco">art deco</a> building is within the <a href="Parliamentary%20Triangle">Parliamentary Triangle</a> of Canberra, and was constructed in 1932 at the corner of <a href="Kings%20Avenue%2C%20Canberra">Kings Avenue</a> and <a href="National%20Circuit%2C%20Canberra">National Circuit</a>, in <a href="Parkes%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Parkes, Australian Capital Territory</a>.

Hasekura Tsunenaga

Hasekura Rokuemon Tsunenaga (or "Philip Francis Faxicura", baptized as "Francisco Felipe Faxicura", in Spain) (1571–1622) (, also spelled Faxecura Rocuyemon in period European sources, reflecting the contemporary pronunciation of Japanese) was a Japanese <a href="samurai">samurai</a> and retainer of <a href="Date%20Masamune">Date Masamune</a>, the "<a href="daimy%C5%8D">daimyō</a>" of <a href="Sendai">Sendai</a> of Japanese imperial descent with ancestral ties to <a href="Emperor%20Kanmu">Emperor Kanmu</a>.

In the years 1613 through 1620, Hasekura headed a diplomatic mission to Spain and the <a href="Holy%20See">Vatican</a> in Rome, traveling through <a href="New%20Spain">New Spain</a> (arriving in <a href="Acapulco">Acapulco</a> and departing from <a href="Veracruz">Veracruz</a>) and visiting various ports-of-call in Europe. This historic mission is called the "<a href="Keich%C5%8D">Keichō</a>" Embassy (), and follows the "<a href="Tensh%C5%8D%20embassy">Tenshō embassy</a>" () of 1582. On the return trip, Hasekura and his companions re-traced their route across New Spain in 1619, sailing from Acapulco for <a href="Manila">Manila</a>, and then sailing north to Japan in 1620. He is conventionally considered the first Japanese ambassador in the Americas and in Spain.

Although Hasekura's embassy was cordially received in Spain and Rome, it happened at a time when Japan was moving toward the <a href="Kirishitan">suppression of Christianity</a>. European monarchs such as the <a href="List%20of%20Spanish%20monarchs">King of Spain</a> thus refused the trade agreements Hasekura had been seeking. Hasekura returned to Japan in 1620 and died of illness a year later, his embassy seemingly ending with few results in an increasingly isolationist Japan.

Japan's next embassy to Europe would only occur more than 200 years later, following <a href="sakoku">two centuries of isolation</a>, with the "<a href="First%20Japanese%20Embassy%20to%20Europe">First Japanese Embassy to Europe</a>" in 1862.

Little is known of the early life of Hasekura Tsunenaga. According to "Date Sejin Kafu" (), he was of Japanese imperial descent, the child of Yamaguchi Tsuneshige () who had ancestral ties with <a href="Emperor%20Kanmu">Emperor Kanmu</a>. He was a mid-level noble samurai in the <a href="Sendai%20Domain">Sendai Domain</a> in northern Japan, who had the opportunity to directly serve the "<a href="daimy%C5%8D">daimyō</a>" <a href="Date%20Masamune">Date Masamune</a>. He spent his young adulthood at the scenic Kamitate Castle () that was constructed in <a href="Hasekura">Hasekura</a> Ward, <a href="Kawasaki%2C%20Miyagi">Kawasaki</a> City (ex-Hasekura Village), <a href="Miyagi%20Prefecture">Miyagi Prefecture</a>, by his grandfather Hasekura Tsunemasa (). The place of origin of the family name "Hasekura" was Hasekura Village (), now <a href="Hasekura">Hasekura</a> Ward () in <a href="Kawasaki%2C%20Miyagi">Kawasaki</a> City.
Hasekura and Date Masamune were of roughly the same age, and it is recorded that several important missions were given to Tsunenaga as his representative.
It is also recorded that Hasekura served as a <a href="samurai">samurai</a> during the <a href="Japanese%20invasions%20of%20Korea%20%281592%E2%80%931598%29">Japanese invasion of Korea</a> under the <a href="Sessho%20and%20Kampaku">Taikō</a> <a href="Toyotomi%20Hideyoshi">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a>, for six months in 1597.

In 1612, Hasekura's father, Hasekura Tsunenari (), was indicted for corruption, and he was put to death in 1613. His fief was confiscated, and his son should normally have been executed as well. Date, however, gave him the opportunity to redeem his honour by placing him in charge of the Embassy to Europe, and soon gave him back his territories as well.

The <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish</a> started <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">trans-Pacific</a> voyages between <a href="New%20Spain">New Spain</a> (present-day <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> and the U.S. state of <a href="California">California</a>) and the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> in 1565. The famous <a href="Manila%20galleon">Manila galleon</a>s carried silver from Mexican mines westward to the <a href="entrep%C3%B4t">entrepôt</a> of <a href="Manila">Manila</a> in the Spanish possession of the Philippines. There, the silver was used to purchase spices and trade goods gathered from throughout Asia, including (until 1638) goods from Japan. The return route of the Manila galleons, first charted by the Spanish navigator <a href="Andr%C3%A9s%20de%20Urdaneta">Andrés de Urdaneta</a>, took the ships northeast into the <a href="Kuroshio%20Current">Kuroshio Current</a> (also known as the Japan Current) off the coast of Japan, and then across the Pacific to the west coast of <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, landing eventually in <a href="Acapulco">Acapulco</a>.

Spanish ships were occasionally shipwrecked on the coasts of Japan due to bad weather, initiating contacts with the country. The Spanish wished to expand the Christian faith in Japan. Efforts to expand influence in Japan were met by stiff resistance from the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuits</a>, who had started the <a href="evangelism">evangelizing</a> of the country in 1549, as well as by the opposition of the <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese</a> and <a href="Dutch%20Empire">Dutch</a> who did not wish to see Spain participate in Japanese trade. However, some Japanese, such as <a href="Christopher%20and%20Cosmas">Christopher and Cosmas</a>, are known to have crossed the Pacific onboard Spanish <a href="galleon">galleon</a>s as early as 1587. It is known that gifts were exchanged between the governor of the Philippines and <a href="Toyotomi%20Hideyoshi">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a>, who thanks him in a 1597 letter, writing "The black elephant in particular I found most unusual."

In 1609, the Spanish Manila galleon "San Francisco" encountered bad weather on its way from Manila to Acapulco, and was wrecked on the Japanese coast in <a href="Chiba%20Prefecture">Chiba</a>, near Tokyo. The sailors were rescued and welcomed, and the ship's captain, <a href="Rodrigo%20de%20Vivero%2C%201st%20Count%20of%20Valle%20de%20Orizaba">Rodrigo de Vivero</a>, former interim governor of the Philippines, met with the retired "shōgun" <a href="Tokugawa%20Ieyasu">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a>. Rodrigo de Vivero drafted a treaty, signed on 29 November 1609, whereby the Spaniards could establish a factory in eastern Japan, mining specialists would be imported from New Spain, Spanish ships would be allowed to visit Japan in case of necessity, and a Japanese embassy would be sent to the Spanish court.

A <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> friar named <a href="Luis%20Sotelo">Luis Sotelo</a>, who was <a href="proselytism">proselytizing</a> in the area of what is now modern Tokyo, convinced <a href="Tokugawa%20Ieyasu">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a> and his son <a href="Tokugawa%20Hidetada">Tokugawa Hidetada</a> to send him as a representative to New Spain (Mexico) on one of their ships, in order to advance the trade treaty. Rodrigo de Vivero offered to sail on the Japanese ship in order to guarantee the safety of their reception in New Spain, but insisted that another Franciscan, named Alonso Muños, be sent instead as the "shōgun"s representative. In 1610, Rodrigo de Vivero, several Spanish sailors, the Franciscan father, and 22 Japanese representatives led by the trader <a href="Tanaka%20Sh%C5%8Dsuke">Tanaka Shōsuke</a> sailed to Mexico aboard the <a href="Japanese%20warship%20San%20Buena%20Ventura">"San Buena Ventura"</a>, a ship built by the English adventurer William Adams for the "shōgun". Once in New Spain, Alonso Muños met with the Viceroy <a href="Luis%20de%20Velasco%2C%20marqu%C3%A9s%20de%20Salinas">Luis de Velasco</a>, who agreed to send an ambassador to Japan in the person of the famous explorer <a href="Sebasti%C3%A1n%20Vizca%C3%ADno">Sebastián Vizcaíno</a> with the added mission of exploring the "Gold and silver islands" ("") that were thought to be east of the Japanese isles.

Vizcaino arrived in Japan in 1611 and had many meetings with the "shōgun" and feudal lords. These encounters were tainted by his poor respect for Japanese customs, the mounting resistance of the Japanese towards <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> proselytism, and the intrigues of the Dutch against Spanish ambitions. Vizcaino finally left to search for the "Silver island", during which search he encountered bad weather, forcing him to return to Japan with heavy damage.

Without waiting for Vizcaino, another ship – built in <a href="Izu%2C%20Shizuoka">Izu</a> by the <a href="Tokugawa%20shogunate">Tokugawa shogunate</a> under the <a href="Naval%20history%20of%20Japan">minister of the Navy</a> <a href="Mukai%20Sh%C5%8Dgen">Mukai Shōgen</a>, and named "San Sebastian" – left for Mexico on 9 September 1612 with Luis Sotelo onboard as well as two representatives of Date Masamune, with the objective of advancing the trade agreement with New Spain. However, the ship foundered a few miles from <a href="Uraga%2C%20Kanagawa">Uraga</a>, and the expedition had to be abandoned.

The "shōgun" had a new galleon built in Japan to bring Vizcaino back to <a href="New%20Spain">New Spain</a>, together with a Japanese embassy accompanied by <a href="Luis%20Sotelo">Luis Sotelo</a>. The galleon, named "Date Maru" by the Japanese and later <a href="Japanese%20warship%20San%20Juan%20Bautista">"San Juan Bautista"</a> by the Spanish, took 45 days work in building, with the participation of technical experts from the Bakufu (the Minister of the Navy <a href="Mukai%20Sh%C5%8Dgen">Mukai Shōgen</a>, an acquaintance of William Adams with whom he built several ships, dispatched his Chief Carpenter), 800 <a href="shipwright">shipwright</a>s, 700 <a href="smith%20%28metalwork%29">smith</a>s, and 3,000 <a href="carpenter">carpenter</a>s. The "daimyō" of <a href="Sendai%2C%20Miyagi">Sendai</a>, <a href="Date%20Masamune">Date Masamune</a>, was put in charge of the project. He named one of his retainers, Hasekura Tsunenaga (his fief was rated at around 600 "<a href="koku">koku</a>"), to lead the mission:

The objective of the Japanese embassy was both to discuss trade agreements with the Spanish crown in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>, and to meet with the <a href="Pope%20Paul%20V">Pope</a> in Rome. Date Masamune displayed a great will to welcome the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> religion in his domain: he invited Luis Sotelo and authorized the propagation of Christianity in 1611. In his letter to the Pope, brought by Hasekura, he wrote: "I'll offer my land for a base of your missionary work. Send us as many <a href="Priesthood%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">padres</a> as possible."

Sotelo, in his own account of the travels, emphasizes the religious dimension of the mission, claiming that the main objective was to spread the Christian faith in northern Japan:

The embassy was probably, at that time, part of a plan to diversify and increase trade with foreign countries, before the participation of Christians in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Osaka">Osaka rebellion</a> triggered a radical reaction from the shogunate, with the interdiction of Christianity in the territories it directly controlled, in 1614.

Upon completion, the ship left on 28 October 1613 for Acapulco with around 180 people on board, including 10 samurai of the "shōgun" (provided by the Minister of the Navy <a href="Mukai%20Sh%C5%8Dgen%20Tadakatsu">Mukai Shōgen Tadakatsu</a>), 12 samurai from Sendai, 120 Japanese merchants, sailors, and servants, and around 40 Spaniards and Portuguese, including Sebastian Vizcaino who, in his own words, only had the quality of a passenger.

The ship first reached <a href="Cape%20Mendocino">Cape Mendocino</a> in today's California, and then continued along the coast to arrive in <a href="Acapulco">Acapulco</a> on 25 January 1614 after three months at sea. The Japanese were received with great ceremony, but had to wait in Acapulco until orders were received regarding how to organize the rest of their travels.

Fights erupted between the Japanese and the Spaniards, especially Vizcaino, apparently due to some disputes on the handling of presents from the Japanese ruler. A contemporary journal, written by the historian <a href="Chimalpahin%20Quauhtlehuanitzin">Chimalpahin Quauhtlehuanitzin</a>, a noble Aztec born in <a href="Amecameca">Amecameca</a> (ancient Chalco province) in 1579, whose formal name was Domingo Francisco de San Anton Muñon, relates Vizcaino was seriously wounded in the fight:

Following these fights, orders were promulgated on 4 and 5 March to bring peace back. The orders explained that:

The embassy remained two months in Acapulco and entered <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a> on 24 March, where it was received with great ceremony. The ultimate mission for the embassy was to go on to Europe. The embassy spent some time in Mexico, and then went to <a href="Veracruz%2C%20Veracruz">Veracruz</a> to board the fleet of Don Antonio Oquendo.

Chimalpahin gives some account of the visit of Hasekura.

Hasekura was settled in a house next to the <a href="Church%20of%20San%20Francisco%2C%20Mexico%20City">Church of San Francisco</a>, and met with the Viceroy. He explained to him that he was also planning to meet <a href="Philip%20III%20of%20Spain">King Philip III</a> to offer him peace and to obtain that the Japanese could come to Mexico for trade. On Wednesday 9 April, 20 Japanese were baptized, and 22 more on 20 April by the archbishop in Mexico, don <a href="Juan%20P%C3%A9rez%20de%20la%20Serna">Juan Pérez de la Serna</a>, at the Church of San Francisco. Altogether 63 of them received <a href="confirmation%20%28Christian%20sacrament%29">confirmation</a> on 25 April. Hasekura waited for his travel to Europe to be baptized there:

Chimalpahin explains that Hasekura left some of his compatriots behind before leaving for Europe:

The fleet left for Europe on the "San Jose" on 10 June. Hasekura had to leave the largest parts of the Japanese group behind, who were to wait in Acapulco for the return of the embassy.

Some of them, as well as those from the previous travel of <a href="Tanaka%20Sh%C5%8Dsuke">Tanaka Shōsuke</a>, returned to Japan the same year, sailing back with the "San Juan Bautista":

The embassy stopped and changed ships in <a href="Havana">Havana</a> in Cuba in July 1614. The embassy stayed in <a href="Havana">Havana</a> for six days. A bronze statue was erected on 26 April 2001 at the head of Havana Bay.

The fleet arrived in <a href="Sanl%C3%BAcar%20de%20Barrameda">Sanlúcar de Barrameda</a> on 5 October 1614.

The Japanese embassy met with King <a href="Philip%20III%20of%20Spain">Philip III</a> in Madrid on 30 January 1615. Hasekura remitted to the King a letter from Date Masamune, as well as offer for a <a href="treaty">treaty</a>. The King responded that he would do what he could to accommodate these requests.

Hasekura was baptized on 17 February by the king's personal chaplain, and renamed "Felipe Francisco Hasekura". The baptism ceremony was to have been conducted by the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Toledo">Archbishop of Toledo</a>, <a href="Bernardo%20de%20Sandoval%20y%20Rojas">Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas</a>, though he was too ill to actually carry this out, and the <a href="Duke%20of%20Lerma">Duke of Lerma</a> – the main administrator of Phillip III's rule and the de facto ruler of Spain – was designated as Hasekura's <a href="godparent">godfather</a>.

The embassy stayed eight months in Spain before leaving the country for Italy.

After traveling across Spain, the embassy sailed on the Mediterranean aboard three Spanish <a href="frigate">frigate</a>s towards Italy. Due to bad weather, they had to stay for a few days in the French harbour of <a href="Saint-Tropez">Saint-Tropez</a>, where they were received by the local nobility, and made quite a sensation on the populace.

The visit of the Japanese Embassy is recorded in the city's chronicles as led by "Philip Francis Faxicura, Ambassador to the Pope, from Date Masamunni, King of <a href="Mutsu%20Province">Woxu</a> in Japan".

Many picturesque details of their movements were recorded:

The visit of Hasekura Tsunenaga to Saint-Tropez in 1615 is the first recorded instance of <a href="France%E2%80%93Japan%20relations">France–Japan relations</a>.

The Japanese Embassy went on to Italy where they were able to meet with <a href="Pope%20Paul%20V">Pope Paul V</a> in Rome in November 1615, the same year <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> was first confronted by the <a href="Roman%20Inquisition">Roman Inquisition</a> regarding his findings against <a href="geocentricism">geocentricism</a>. Hasekura remitted to the Pope two <a href="gilding">gilded</a> letters, one in Japanese and one in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, containing a request for a trade treaty between Japan and Mexico and the dispatch of Christian missionaries to Japan. These letters are still visible in the <a href="Vatican%20City">Vatican</a> archives. The Latin letter, probably written by Luis Sotelo for Date Masamune, reads, in part:

The Pope agreed to the dispatch of missionaries, but left the decision for trade to the King of Spain.

The Roman Senate also gave to Hasekura the honorary title of Roman Noble and Roman Citizen, in a document he brought back to Japan, and which is preserved today in Sendai.
Sotelo also described the visit to the Pope, book (published posthumously in 1634):

Besides the official description of Hasekura's visit to Rome, some contemporary communications tend to indicate that political matters were also discussed, and that an alliance with Date Masamune was suggested as a way to establish Christian influence in the whole of Japan:

For the second time in Spain, in April 1616 Hasekura met again with the King, who declined to sign a trade agreement, on the ground that the Japanese Embassy did not appear to be an official embassy from the ruler of Japan <a href="Tokugawa%20Ieyasu">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a>, who, on the contrary, had promulgated an edict in January 1614 ordering the expulsion of all <a href="missionary">missionaries</a> from Japan, and started the persecution of the Christian faith in Japan.

Two years later, after their trip around Europe, the mission left from Seville to New Spain (Mexico), in june 1616. There are remains found in registrations documents, that some japanese could have stayed in Spain, due to their last stop in some villages near Seville (Espartinas and Coria del Río). Curiously, there are some people which last name is "Japón", not only in these region, but all around Spain.

The embassy of Hasekura Tsunenaga was the subject of numerous publications throughout Europe. The Italian writer Scipione Amati, who accompanied the embassy in 1615 and 1616, published in 1615 in Rome a book titled "History of the Kingdom of Woxu". This book was also translated into German in 1617. In 1616, the French publisher <a href="Abraham%20Savgrain">Abraham Savgrain</a> published an account of Hasekura's visit to Rome: "" ("Account of the solemn and remarkable entrance in Rome of Dom Philippe Francois Faxicura").
Hasekura stayed for 5 months in Mexico on his way back to Japan. The "<a href="San%20Juan%20Bautista%20%28ship%29">San Juan Bautista</a>" had been waiting in Acapulco since 1616, after a second trip across the Pacific from Japan to Mexico. Captained by <a href="Yokozawa%20Sh%C5%8Dgen">Yokozawa Shōgen</a>, she was laden with fine pepper and <a href="lacquer">lacquer</a>ware from Kyoto, which were sold on the Mexican market. Following a request by the Spanish king, in order to avoid too much silver leaving to Japan, the Viceroy asked for the proceeds to be spent on Mexican goods, except for an amount of 12,000 <a href="Spanish%20dollar">pesos</a> and 8,000 pesos in silver which Hasekura and Yokozawa could bring back with them respectively.

In April 1618, the "San Juan Bautista" arrived in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> from Mexico, with Hasekura and Luis Sotelo on board. The ship was acquired by the Spanish government there, with the objective of building up defenses against the attacks of the Dutch and the English. In <a href="Manila">Manila</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Manila">archbishop</a> described the deal to the king of Spain in a missive dated 28 July 1619:

During his stay in the Philippines, Hasekura purchased numerous goods for Date Masamune, and built a ship, as he explained in a letter he wrote to his son. He finally returned to Japan in August 1620, reaching the harbour of Nagasaki.

By the time Hasekura came back, Japan had changed quite drastically: an effort to eradicate Christianity had been under way since 1614, <a href="Tokugawa%20Ieyasu">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a> had died in 1616 and been replaced by his more <a href="xenophobia">xenophobic</a> son <a href="Tokugawa%20Hidetada">Tokugawa Hidetada</a>, and Japan was moving towards the "<a href="Sakoku">Sakoku</a>" policy of <a href="isolationism">isolation</a>. Because news of these persecutions arrived in Europe during Hasekura's embassy, European rulers – especially the King of Spain – became very reluctant to respond favorably to Hasekura's trade and missionary proposals.
Hasekura reported his travels to Date Masamune upon his arrival in Sendai. It is recorded that he remitted a portrait of Pope Paul V, a portrait of himself in prayer (shown above), and a set of <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Ceylonese</a> and <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>n daggers acquired in the Philippines, all preserved today in the <a href="Sendai%20City%20Museum">Sendai City Museum</a>. The "Records of the House of Masamune" describe his report in a rather succinct manner, ending with a rather cryptic expression of surprise bordering on the outrage ("") at Hasekura's discourse:

The direct effect of Hasekura's return to Sendai was the interdiction of Christianity in the Sendai fief two days later:

What Hasekura said or did to bring about such a result is unknown. As later events tend to indicate that he and his descendants remained faithful Christians, Hasekura may have made an enthusiastic – and to a certain extent, disturbing – account of the greatness and might of Western countries and the Christian religion. He may also have encouraged an alliance between the Church and Date Masamune to take over the country (an idea advertised by the Franciscans while in Rome), which, in 1620 Japan, would have been a totally unrealistic proposition. Lastly, hopes of trade with Spain evaporated when Hasekura communicated that the Spanish King would not enter an agreement as long as persecutions were occurring in the rest of the country.

Date Masamune suddenly chose to distance himself from the Western faith. The first executions of Christians started 40 days later. The anti-Christian measures taken by Date Masumune were, however, comparatively mild, and Japanese and Western Christians repeatedly claimed that he only took them to appease the "<a href="sh%C5%8Dgun">shōgun</a>":

One month after Hasekura's return, Date Masamune wrote a letter to the "shōgun" <a href="Tokugawa%20Hidetada">Tokugawa Hidetada</a>, in which he makes a very clear effort to evade responsibility for the embassy, explaining in detail how it was organized with the approval, and even the collaboration, of the "shōgun":

Spain, with a colony and an army in the nearby Philippines, was a source of concern for Japan at that time. Hasekura's eyewitness accounts of Spanish power and colonial methods in New Spain (Mexico) may have precipitated the "shōgun" Tokugawa Hidetada's decision to sever trade relations with Spain in 1623, and diplomatic relations in 1624, although other events such as the smuggling of Spanish priests into Japan and a failed Spanish embassy also contributed to the decision.

What became of Hasekura is unknown and accounts of his last years are numerous. Contemporary Christian commentators could rely only on hearsay, with some rumours stating that he abandoned Christianity, others that he was martyred for his faith, and others that he practised Christianity in secret. The fate of his descendants and servants, who were later executed for being Christians, suggests that Hasekura remained strongly Christian and transmitted his faith to the members of his family.
Sotelo, who returned to Japan but was caught and finally <a href="execution%20by%20burning">burnt at the stake</a> in 1624, gave before his execution an account of Hasekura returning to Japan as a hero who propagated the Christian faith:

Hasekura also did bring back to Japan several Catholic artifacts, but he did not give them to his ruler, and instead kept them in his own estate.

Hasekura Tsunenaga died of illness (according to Japanese as well as Christian sources) in 1622, but the location of his grave is not known for certain. Three graves are claimed as Hasekura's. The most likely is in the outskirts of Osato town () in <a href="Miyagi%20Prefecture">Miyagi</a>. Another is visible in the <a href="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> temple of Enfukuji () in <a href="Miyagi%20Prefecture">Miyagi</a>. Another is clearly marked (along with a memorial to PSotelo) in the cemetery of in the Kitayama neighborhood at Komyo Temple ().

Hasekura had a son, named Rokuemon Tsuneyori. Two of his son's servants, Yogoemon (与五右衛門) and his wife, were convicted of being Christian but refused to recant their faith under torture (reverse hanging, called "<a href="Tsurushi">Tsurushi</a>", 釣殺し) and as a result died in August 1637 (as the lives of Christians were spared if they recanted, these executions indicate that they were steadfast and refused to deny their faith). In 1637, Rokuemon Tsuneyori himself also came under suspicion of Christianity after being denounced by someone from <a href="Edo">Edo</a>, but escaped questioning because he was the master of the <a href="Zen">Zen</a> temple of Komyoji (). In 1640, two other servants of Tsuneyori, Tarōzaemon (太郎左衛門, 71), who had followed Hasekura to Rome, and his wife (59), were convicted of being Christians, and, also refusing to recant their faith under torture, died. Tsuneyori was held responsible this time and decapitated the same day, at the age of 42, for having failed to denounce Christians under his roof, although it remained unconfirmed whether he was himself Christian or not. Also, two Christian priests, the <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican</a> Pedro Vazquez and Joan Bautista Paulo, had given his name under torture. Tsuneyori's younger brother, Tsunemichi, was convicted as a Christian, but managed to flee and disappear.

The privileges of the Hasekura family were abolished at this point by the Sendai fief, and their property and belongings seized. It is at this time, in 1640, that Hasekura's Christian artifacts were confiscated, and they were kept in custody in Sendai until they were rediscovered at the end of the 19th century.

Altogether, around fifty Christian artifacts were found in Hasekura's estate in 1640, such as crosses, <a href="rosary">rosaries</a>, religious gowns, and religious paintings. The artifacts were seized and stored by the Date fief. An inventory was made again in 1840 describing the items as belonging to Hasekura Tsunenaga. Nineteen books were also mentioned in the inventory, but they have been lost since. The artifacts are today preserved in the <a href="Sendai%20City%20Museum">Sendai City Museum</a> and other museums in Sendai.

Tsuneyori's son, Tsunenobu (常信), grandson of Tsunenaga Hasekura, survived. He founded a Hasekura family line that continues to the present day. The first to 10th heads of the Hasekura Family lived in <a href="%C5%8Csato%2C%20Miyagi">Osato</a>-city, <a href="Miyagi%20Prefecture">Miyagi Prefecture</a>. The 11th head moved to <a href="Wakabayashi">Wakabayashi</a> Ward, <a href="Sendai">Sendai</a> City, Miyagi Prefecture where the present 13th head, Tsunetaka Hasekura, resides. The 13th head actively works in both Miyagi and <a href="Akita%20Prefecture">Akita Prefecture</a>s.

The very existence of the travels of Hasekura was forgotten in Japan until the reopening of the country after the <a href="Sakoku">Sakoku</a> policy of isolation. In 1873, a Japanese embassy to Europe (the <a href="Iwakura%20mission">Iwakura mission</a>) headed by <a href="Iwakura%20Tomomi">Iwakura Tomomi</a> heard for the first time of the travels of Hasekura when shown documents during their visit to <a href="Venice">Venice</a> in Italy.

Today, there are statues of Hasekura Tsunenaga in the outskirts of <a href="Acapulco">Acapulco</a> in Mexico, at the entrance of <a href="Havana">Havana</a> Bay in Cuba, in <a href="Coria%20del%20R%C3%ADo">Coria del Río</a> in Spain, in the Church of <a href="Civitavecchia">Civitavecchia</a> in Italy, in Tsukinoura, near <a href="Ishinomaki">Ishinomaki</a>, and two in Osato town in Miyagi.

Approximately 700 inhabitants of Coria del Río bear the surname "Japón" (originally "Hasekura de Japón"), identifying them as descendants of the members of Hasekura Tsunenaga's delegation.

A theme park describing the embassy and displaying a replica of the "San Juan Bautista" was established in the harbour of Ishinomaki, from which Hasekura initially departed on his voyage.

Today there stands a statue of Hasekura in a park in <a href="Manila">Manila</a>, the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>.

<a href="Sh%C5%ABsaku%20End%C5%8D">Shūsaku Endō</a> wrote a 1980 novel, titled "The Samurai", a fictitious account relating the travels of Hasekura.

The 1991 film "Journey of Honor" (aka "Kabuto", aka "Shogun Mayeda") starring <a href="Sho%20Kosugi">Sho Kosugi</a> was loosely based on Hasekura's expedition and recounts the adventures of a samurai journey from Japan to Spain.

A 2005 animation film produced in Spain and titled "<a href="Gisaku">Gisaku</a>" relates the adventures of a young Japanese samurai named Yohei who visited Spain in the 17th century, in a story loosely taking its inspiration from the travels of Hasekura. Yohei survived in hiding to the present day due to magical powers ("After centuries of lethargy, he awakes in a World he does not know"), and accomplishes many adventures in modern Europe as a superhero.

Issy Smith

Issy Smith, <a href="Victoria%20Cross">VC</a> ( – 11 September 1940) was a British-Australian recipient of the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to eligible forces of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> and United Kingdom. In recognition of his VC, he was also awarded the French <a href="Croix%20de%20guerre%201914%E2%80%931918%20%28France%29">Croix de Guerre</a> and Russian <a href="Cross%20of%20St.%20George">Cross of St. George</a> (4th class) by the respective governments.

Born Ishroulch Shmeilowitz (and other renderings), to parents residing in Egypt, Smith travelled to Britain as a child stowaway and first volunteered to serve in the British Army in 1904. He emigrated to Australia after discharge, where he remained until mobilised as a reservist in 1914. As a corporal in the 1st Battalion, <a href="The%20Manchester%20Regiment">The Manchester Regiment</a>, Smith was engaged in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Ypres">Second Battle of Ypres</a>. On 26 April 1915, Smith, on his own initiative, recovered wounded soldiers while exposed to sustained fire and attended to them "with the greatest devotion to duty regardless of personal risk". His conduct secured a recommendation for the Victoria Cross, which was awarded to Smith in August 1915.

After his demobilisation, Smith returned to Australia with his wife and daughter. He became a prominent figure in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>'s Jewish community, was appointed a <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">Justice of the Peace</a>, and unsuccessfully stood as a candidate for the <a href="United%20Australia%20Party">United Australia Party</a> in the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201931">1931 general election</a>.

Smith was born in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, the son of French citizens Moses and Eva Shmeilowitz, who were of Russian origin. His father was employed by the French Consulate-General as a clerk. Aged 11, Smith embarked as a stowaway aboard a vessel proceeding to London. Undaunted by this unfamiliar environment, Smith attended Berner Street School, Commercial Street, and worked as a deliverer in the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End</a>, then an impoverished <a href="ghetto">ghetto</a> where <a href="Yiddish">Yiddish</a> was the predominant spoken language. Persecution and extreme deprivation had compelled millions of Eastern European Jews to migrate to Western Europe, the Americas, and elsewhere. By the time of Issy Smith's arrival, Jewish immigration to Britain had peaked and was further curtailed by the enactment of the <a href="Aliens%20Act%201905">Aliens Act</a> in 1905.

He joined the British Army in 1904, becoming a private in the Manchester Regiment. The pseudonym Issy Smith was adopted in the process of enlisting at the behest of a recruiting sergeant. Smith completed his training, serving in South Africa and India with the 1st Battalion. He boxed competitively, winning the British Army's middleweight championship, and played <a href="soccer">football</a>. While in India, Smith was present at the <a href="Delhi%20Durbar">Delhi Durbar</a> parade, in which the 1st Manchesters participated, and was thus awarded the Delhi Durbar Medal.

Accepting his discharge in 1912, Smith emigrated to Australia after brief employment in London. He lived in the Melbourne suburb of <a href="Ascot%20Vale%2C%20Victoria">Ascot Vale</a> while working for the city's gas company. Retained as a reservist, Smith was mobilised by the British Army after the commencement of hostilities in August 1914. Some sources state that Smith was present at the capture of <a href="German%20New%20Guinea">German New Guinea</a> by the <a href="Australian%20Naval%20and%20Military%20Expeditionary%20Force">Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force</a>.

The 1st Manchester Regiment, stationed in India, sailed from <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a> for France on 29 August 1914 as the constituent British battalion of the Jullundur Brigade, <a href="3rd%20%28Lahore%29%20Division">3rd (Lahore) Division</a>. The battalion disembarked at <a href="Marseilles">Marseilles</a> in late September, but was not deployed to the front until 26 October 1914, when it occupied trenches east of <a href="Festubert">Festubert</a>.

Actively engaged in the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Givenchy">Givenchy</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Neuve%20Chapelle">Neuve Chapelle</a>, the 1st Manchesters had incurred hundreds of casualties by the beginning of <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Ypres">"Second Ypres"</a> on 22 April 1915. <a href="Chemical%20warfare">Chemical warfare</a> first emerged on the Western Front during the German offensive, and Smith himself would be temporarily incapacitated by gas. The 1st Manchesters were involved in an initially successful counter-attack conducted by the Jullundur and Ferozepore brigades on 26 April 1915, near Wieltje, in conjunction with other Allied units. Rudimentary forms of protection against the <a href="chlorine%20gas">chlorine gas</a> proved ineffectual, limiting the advance and causing many soldiers to succumb to its effects.

During the Allied counter-attack, Smith, of his own volition, ventured towards a German position to attend to a severely wounded soldier. He carried him some to relative safety while exposed to intense German fire. According to the Victoria Cross citation, he brought in "many more wounded men" throughout the day under similarly perilous conditions "regardless of personal risk". Recounting his own rescue by Smith to a "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" correspondent, Sergeant Rooke said of the corporal: "He behaved with wonderful coolness and presence of mind the whole time, and no man deserved a Victoria Cross more thoroughly than he did".
Smith was hospitalised in Dublin, where he recuperated from his gassing. His Victoria Cross was later presented to him at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> by <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George V</a>. He was feted by publications such as "<a href="The%20Jewish%20Chronicle">The Jewish Chronicle</a>", and his status as a recipient of the VC was utilised by the British government for the purposes of stimulating further recruitment. His visits to Jewish communities in the United Kingdom generated much interest, attracting dignitaries and large crowds in the process. On one such occasion, in September 1915, he was invited back to his old school in the East End to receive a gold watch and chain in honour of his Victoria Cross from his former schoolmates. Also that month, Smith was received at <a href="Mansion%20House%2C%20Dublin">Mansion House, Dublin</a>, by the <a href="Under-Secretary%20for%20Ireland">Under-Secretary for Ireland</a>, <a href="Matthew%20Nathan">Matthew Nathan</a>, who took advantage of the occasion to reaffirm loyalty to both Britain and Ireland. Contemporaries, however, continued to report instances of discrimination against Jewish servicemen, including an incident involving Issy Smith in Leeds. While documenting his recruitment drive, "The Jewish Chronicle" reported that the proprietor of the Grand Restaurant had refused to serve Smith during his tour of <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> because he was Jewish, while indicating the staff were prepared to accept his non-Jewish acquaintance. Smith's tour continued without disruption, taking him to <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, Scotland.

Meanwhile, on the Western Front, the demoralised and depleted Indian Corps fought its final European battle at <a href="Battle%20of%20Loos">Loos</a>. With the exception of two cavalry divisions, the Indian Corps in Europe redeployed to the Middle East theatre, sailing from Marseilles on 10 December 1915 and arriving in <a href="Basra">Basra</a> on 8 January 1916 to be integrated into the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force. Smith returned to active duty as a sergeant, serving in <a href="Mesopotamian%20Campaign">Mesopotamia</a> and <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">Palestine</a> until the cessation of hostilities with the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and Germany on 30 October and 11 November respectively. He had been wounded five times.

Demobilised after the war, Smith returned to London. As a war hero, he was intermittently invited to social functions. In June 1920, he attended a garden party at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>, given by the king for all surviving Victoria Cross recipients. They included veterans of the <a href="Indian%20Rebellion%20of%201857">Indian Mutiny</a>, <a href="Rorke%27s%20Drift">Rorke's Drift</a>, <a href="Nile%20Expedition">Relief of General Gordon</a>, the <a href="First%20Boer%20War">First</a> and <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>s, countless campaigns on the borders of the empire, and dozens from the <a href="World%20War%20I">Great War</a>. In October 1921, with <a href="Henry%20Edward%20Kenny">Harry Kenny</a>, he unveiled the <a href="Hackney%20War%20Memorial">Hackney War Memorial</a>. In 1922, he attended "The Pilgrimage to Ypres", in Belgium, laying a wreath at the <a href="Cloth%20Hall%2C%20Ypres">Cloth Hall</a> there.

Despite his fame and popularity, like many former servicemen contending with post-war economic hardship, Smith struggled financially – a predicament compounded by illness. As a consequence he pawned his medals for <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>20, only for them to be recovered by the <a href="Jewish%20Historical%20Society%20of%20England">Jewish Historical Society</a> on the urging of the wife of Chief Rabbi <a href="Joseph%20Hertz">Joseph Hertz</a> and ultimately reunited with Smith. Smith's varied occupations in post-war Britain included work as an actor with a theatre troupe. He emigrated to Australia in 1925 with his wife Elsie (née McKechnie), whom he had married at <a href="Camberwell">Camberwell</a> Register Office. Marriage to Elsie produced two children (Olive and Maurice) and reputedly angered his parents despite the couple's later observance of Jewish religious tradition in a formal ceremony held at Central <a href="Synagogue">Synagogue</a>, Hallam Street.

The family settled in <a href="Moonee%20Ponds%2C%20Victoria">Moonee Ponds</a>, Melbourne, where Smith's standing in the Jewish community became high. There he joined the Essendon sub branch of the RSL. He was appointed manager of <a href="Associated%20British%20Picture%20Corporation">British International Pictures</a> in Melbourne, in 1928, worked for <a href="Dunlop%20Australia">Dunlop Rubber Company</a>, and was finally employed by the Civil Aviation Board at <a href="Essendon%20Airport">Essendon Airport</a>. Appointed a <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">Justice of the Peace</a> in 1930, Smith tried politics as a candidate in the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201931">1931 federal election</a> for the <a href="United%20Australia%20Party">United Australia Party</a> contesting the seat of <a href="Division%20of%20Melbourne">Melbourne</a> in the <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a>, and "seriously challenged the hitherto unassailable <a href="William%20Maloney">Dr Maloney</a>".

Smith died of <a href="coronary%20thrombosis">coronary thrombosis</a> in September 1940. He was buried in the Jewish section of Fawkner Cemetery with full military honours. His Victoria Cross was sold by his family in 1990 and later auctioned as part of a collection of Smith's medals, selling for approximately £30,000 (<a href="United%20States%20Dollar">US$</a>60,000).

Following representations from the Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen and Women, in September 2013 <a href="Communities%20Secretary">Communities Secretary</a> <a href="Eric%20Pickles">Eric Pickles</a> announced that the plan to memorialise British-born <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> Victoria Cross medal holders by laying commemorative paving stones in their home towns would be extended to include Smith, who was born in Egypt.

Painted turtle

The painted turtle ("Chrysemys picta") is the most widespread native <a href="turtle">turtle</a> of North America. It lives in slow-moving fresh waters, from southern Canada to northern Mexico, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The turtle is the <a href="Monotypic%20taxon">only species</a> of the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Chrysemys", which is part of the pond turtle family <a href="Emydidae">Emydidae</a>. Fossils show that the painted turtle existed 15 million years ago. Four regionally based <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> (the eastern, midland, southern, and western) evolved during the <a href="Last%20glacial%20period">last ice age</a>.

The adult painted turtle female is long; the male is smaller. The turtle's top shell is dark and smooth, without a ridge. Its skin is olive to black with red, orange, or yellow stripes on its extremities. The subspecies can be distinguished by their shells: the eastern has straight-aligned top shell segments; the midland has a large gray mark on the bottom shell; the southern has a red line on the top shell; the western has a red pattern on the bottom shell.

The turtle eats aquatic vegetation, <a href="algae">algae</a>, and small water creatures including insects, <a href="crustaceans">crustaceans</a>, and fish. Although they are frequently consumed as eggs or hatchlings by rodents, canines, and snakes, the adult turtles' hard shells protect them from most predators. Reliant on warmth from its surroundings, the painted turtle is active only during the day when it basks for hours on logs or rocks. During winter, the turtle <a href="hibernation">hibernates</a>, usually in the mud at the bottom of water bodies. The turtles mate in spring and autumn. Females dig nests on land and lay eggs between late spring and mid-summer. Hatched turtles grow until <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a>: 2–9 years for males, 6–16 for females.

In the traditional tales of <a href="Algonquian%20peoples">Algonquian tribes</a>, the colorful turtle played the part of a trickster. In modern times, four U.S. states have named the painted turtle their <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20reptiles">official reptile</a>. While <a href="Habitat%20destruction">habitat loss</a> and <a href="Roadkill">road killings</a> have reduced the turtle's population, its ability to live in human-disturbed settings has helped it remain the most abundant turtle in North America. Adults in the wild can live for more than 55 years. 

The painted turtle's shell is long, oval, smooth with little grooves where the large scale-like plates overlap, and flat-bottomed. The color of the top shell (<a href="carapace">carapace</a>) varies from olive to black. Darker specimens are more common where the bottom of the water body is darker. The bottom shell (<a href="plastron">plastron</a>) is yellow, sometimes red, sometimes with dark markings in the center. Similar to the top shell, the turtle's skin is olive to black, but with red and yellow stripes on its neck, legs, and tail. As with other pond turtles, such as the <a href="bog%20turtle">bog turtle</a>, the painted turtle's feet are webbed to aid swimming.

The head of the turtle is distinctive. The face has only yellow stripes, with a large yellow spot and streak behind each eye, and on the chin two wide yellow stripes that meet at the tip of the jaw. The turtle's upper jaw is shaped into an inverted "V" (<a href="philtrum">philtrum</a>), with a downward-facing, tooth-like projection on each side.

The hatchling has a proportionally larger head, eyes, and tail, and a more circular shell than the adult. The adult female is generally longer than the male, versus . For a given length, the female has a higher (more rounded, less flat) top shell. The female weighs around on average, against the males' average adult weight of roughly . The female's greater body volume supports her egg-production. The male has longer foreclaws and a longer, thicker tail, with the anus (<a href="cloaca">cloaca</a>) located further out on the tail.

Although the subspecies of painted turtle <a href="Intergradation">intergrade</a> (blend together) at range boundaries they are distinct within the hearts of their ranges.


The painted turtle has a very similar appearance to the <a href="red-eared%20slider">red-eared slider</a> (the most common pet turtle) and the two are often confused. The painted turtle can be distinguished because it is flatter than the slider. Also, the slider has a prominent red marking on the side of its head (the "ear") and a spotted bottom shell, both features missing in the painted turtle.

The painted turtle hunts along water bottoms. It quickly juts its head into and out of vegetation to stir potential victims out into the open water, where they are pursued. The turtle holds large prey in its mouth and tears the prey apart with its forefeet. It also consumes plants and skims the surface of the water with its mouth open to catch small particles of food.

Although all subspecies of painted turtle eat both <a href="omnivore">plants and animals</a>, their specific diets vary.


Painted turtles are most vulnerable to predators when young. Nests are frequently ransacked and the eggs eaten by <a href="Plains%20garter%20snake">garter snakes</a>, crows, chipmunks, <a href="thirteen-lined%20ground%20squirrel">thirteen-lined ground</a> and <a href="Eastern%20gray%20squirrel">gray squirrels</a>, skunks, <a href="groundhog">groundhog</a>s, raccoons, badgers, <a href="Gray%20fox">gray</a> and <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>, and humans. The small and sometimes bite-size, numerous hatchlings fall prey to <a href="Nepomorpha">water bugs</a>, bass, catfish, bullfrogs, <a href="snapping%20turtle">snapping turtle</a>s, three types of snakes (<a href="Agkistrodon">copperheads</a>, <a href="Coluber">racers</a> and <a href="Nerodia">water snakes</a>), herons, <a href="Oryzomys">rice rats</a>, weasels, <a href="muskrats">muskrats</a>, minks, and raccoons. As adults, the turtles' armored shells protect them from many potential predators, but they still occasionally fall prey to alligators, <a href="osprey">osprey</a>s, crows, <a href="red-shouldered%20hawk">red-shouldered hawk</a>s, bald eagles, and especially raccoons.

Painted turtles defend themselves by kicking, scratching, biting, or urinating. In contrast to land tortoises, painted turtles can right themselves if they are flipped upside down.

The painted turtles mate in spring and fall in waters of . Males start <a href="Spermatogenesis">producing sperm</a> in early spring, when they can bask to an internal temperature of . Females begin their reproductive cycles in mid-summer, and <a href="Ovulation%23Ovulation%20in%20animals">ovulate</a> the following spring.

<a href="Courtship%20display">Courtship</a> begins when a male follows a female until he meets her face-to-face. He then strokes her face and neck with his elongated front claws, a gesture returned by a receptive female. The pair repeat the process several times, with the male retreating from and then returning to the female until she swims to the bottom, where they <a href="Sexual%20intercourse%23In%20other%20animals">copulate</a>. As the male is smaller than the female, he is not dominant. The female stores <a href="sperm">sperm</a>, to be used for up to three <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutches</a>, in her <a href="Oviduct%23Amniotes">oviducts</a>; the sperm may remain viable for up to three years. A single clutch <a href="Superfecundation%23Heteropaternal%20superfecundation">may have multiple fathers</a>.

<a href="Nesting%20instinct">Nesting</a> is done, by the females only, between late May and mid-July. The nests are vase-shaped and are usually dug in sandy soil, often at sites with southern exposures. Nests are often within of water, but may be as far away as , with older females tending to nest further inland. Nest sizes vary depending on female sizes and locations but are about deep. Females may return to the same sites several consecutive years, but if several females make their nests close together, the eggs become more vulnerable to predators.

The female's optimal body temperature while digging her nest is . If the weather is unsuitable, for instance a too hot night in the Southeast, she delays the process until later at night. Painted turtles in Virginia have been observed waiting three weeks to nest because of a hot drought.

While preparing to dig her nest, the female sometimes exhibits a mysterious preliminary behavior. She presses her throat against the ground of different potential sites, perhaps sensing moisture, warmth, texture, or smell, although her exact motivation is unknown. She may further temporize by excavating several false nests as the <a href="wood%20turtle">wood turtle</a>s also do.

The female relies on her hind feet for digging. She may accumulate so much sand and mud on her feet that her mobility is reduced, making her vulnerable to predators. To lighten her labors, she lubricates the area with her bladder water. Once the nest is complete, the female deposits into the hole. The freshly laid eggs are white, elliptical, porous, and flexible. From start to finish, the female's work may take four hours. Sometimes she remains on land overnight afterwards, before returning to her home water.

Females can lay five clutches per year, but two is a normal average after including the 30–50% of a population's females that do not produce any clutches in a given year. In some northern populations, no females lay more than one clutch per year. Bigger females tend to lay bigger eggs and more eggs per clutch. Clutch sizes of the subspecies vary, although the differences may reflect different environments, rather than different genetics. The two more northerly subspecies, western and midland, are larger and have more eggs per clutch—11.9 and 7.6, respectively—than the two more southerly subspecies, southern (4.2) and eastern (4.9). Within subspecies, also, the more northerly females lay larger clutches.

Incubation lasts 72–80 days in the wild and for a similar period in artificial conditions. In August and September, the young turtle breaks out from its egg, using a special projection of its jaw called the <a href="egg%20tooth">egg tooth</a>. Not all offspring leave the nest immediately, though. Hatchlings north of a line from Nebraska to northern Illinois to New Jersey typically arrange themselves symmetrically in the nest and overwinter to emerge the following spring.

The hatchling's ability to survive winter in the nest has allowed the painted turtle to extend its range farther north than any other American turtle. The painted turtle is genetically adapted to survive extended periods of subfreezing temperatures with blood that can remain <a href="supercooling">supercooled</a> and skin that resists penetration from ice crystals in the surrounding ground. The hardest freezes nevertheless kill many hatchlings.

Immediately after hatching, turtles are dependent on egg yolk material for sustenance. About a week to a week and a half after emerging from their eggs (or the following spring if emergence is delayed), hatchlings begin feeding to support growth. The young turtles grow rapidly at first, sometimes doubling their size in the first year. Growth slows sharply at <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a> and may stop completely. Likely owing to differences of habitat and food by water body, growth rates often differ from population to population in the same area. Among the subspecies, the western painted turtles are the quickest growers.

Females grow faster than males overall, and must be larger to mature sexually. In most populations males reach sexual maturity at 2–4 years old, and females at 6–10. Size and age at maturity increase with latitude; at the northern edge of their range, males reach sexual maturity at 7–9 years of age and females at 11–16.

A <a href="Ectotherm">cold-blooded</a> reptile, the painted turtle regulates its temperature through its environment, notably by basking. All ages bask for warmth, often alongside other species of turtle. Sometimes more than 50 individuals are seen on one log together. Turtles bask on a variety of objects, often logs, but have even been seen basking on top of <a href="common%20loon">common loon</a>s that were covering eggs.

The turtle <a href="diurnality">starts its day at sunrise</a>, emerging from the water to bask for several hours. Warmed for activity, it returns to the water to forage. After becoming chilled, the turtle re-emerges for one to two more cycles of basking and feeding. At night, the turtle drops to the bottom of its water body or perches on an underwater object and sleeps.

To be active, the turtle must maintain an internal body temperature between . When fighting infection, it manipulates its temperature up to 5 °C (8 °F) higher than normal.

In the spring, when the water reaches , the turtle begins actively foraging. However, if the water temperature exceeds , the turtle will not feed. In fall, the turtle stops foraging when temperatures drop below the spring set-point.

During the winter, the turtle hibernates. In the north, the inactive season may be as long as from October to March, while the southernmost populations may not hibernate at all. While hibernating, the body temperature of the painted turtle averages . Periods of warm weather bring the turtle out of hibernation, and even in the north, individuals have been seen basking in February.

The painted turtle hibernates by burying itself, either on the bottom of a body of water, near water in the shore-bank or the burrow of a <a href="muskrat">muskrat</a>, or in woods or pastures. When hibernating underwater, the turtle prefers shallow depths, no more than . Within the mud, it may dig down an additional . In this state, the turtle does not breathe, although if surroundings allow, it may get some oxygen through its skin. The species is one of the best-studied <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s able to survive long periods <a href="Hypoxia%20%28medical%29">without oxygen</a>. Adaptations of its blood chemistry, brain, heart, and particularly its shell allow the turtle to survive extreme <a href="lactic%20acid">lactic acid</a> buildup while oxygen-deprived.

Searching for water, food, or mates, the painted turtles travel up to several kilometers at a time. During summer, in response to heat and water-clogging vegetation, the turtles may vacate shallow marshes for more permanent waters. Short overland migrations may involve hundreds of turtles together. If heat and drought are prolonged, the turtles will <a href="Estivation">bury themselves</a> and, in extreme cases, die.

Foraging turtles frequently cross lakes or travel linearly down creeks. Daily crossings of large ponds have been observed. <a href="Tracking%20animal%20migration">Tag and release</a> studies show that sex also drives turtle movement. Males travel the most, up to , between captures; females the second most, up to , between captures; and juveniles the least, less than , between captures. Males move the most and are most likely to change wetlands because they seek mates.

The painted turtles, through visual recognition, have <a href="Homing%20%28biology%29">homing</a> capabilities. Many individuals can return to their collection points after being released elsewhere, trips that may require them to traverse land. One experiment placed 98 turtles varying several-kilometer distances from their home wetland; 41 returned. When living in a single large body of water, the painted turtles can home from up to away. Females may use homing to help locate suitable nesting sites.

The most widespread North American turtle, the painted turtle is the only turtle whose native range extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It is native to eight of Canada's ten provinces, forty-five of the fifty United States, and one of Mexico's thirty-one states. On the East Coast, it lives from the <a href="Maritimes">Canadian Maritimes</a> to the U.S. state of Georgia. On the West Coast, it lives in British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon and offshore on southeast <a href="Vancouver%20Island">Vancouver Island</a>. The northernmost American turtle, its range includes much of southern Canada. To the south, its range reaches the U.S. Gulf Coast in Louisiana and Alabama. In the southwestern United States there are only dispersed populations. It is found in one river in extreme northern Mexico. It is absent in a part of southwestern Virginia and the adjacent states as well as in north-central Alabama.

The borders between the four subspecies are not sharp, because the subspecies interbreed. Many studies have been performed in the border regions to assess the intermediate turtles, usually by comparing the anatomical features of hybrids that result from intergradation of the classical subspecies. Despite the imprecision, the subspecies are assigned nominal ranges.

The eastern painted turtle ranges from southeastern Canada to Georgia with a western boundary at approximately the Appalachians. At its northern extremes, the turtle tends to be restricted to the warmer areas closer to the Atlantic Ocean. It is uncommon in far north New Hampshire and in Maine is common only in a strip about 50 miles from the coast. In Canada, it lives in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia but not in Quebec or Prince Edward Island. To the south it is not found in the coastal lowlands of southern North Carolina, South Carolina, or Georgia, or in southern Georgia in general or at all in Florida. 

The eastern subspecies's range extends slightly into east central Alabama, where it intergrades with the southern subspecies. In the northeast, there is extensive mixing with the midland subspecies, and some writers have called these turtles a "hybrid swarm". In the southeast, the border between the eastern and midland is more sharp as mountain chains separate the subspecies to different drainage basins.

The midland painted turtle lives from southern Ontario and Quebec, through the eastern U.S. Midwest states, to Kentucky, Tennessee and northwestern Alabama, where it intergrades with the southern painted turtle. It also is found eastward through West Virginia, western Maryland and Pennsylvania. The midland painted turtle appears to be moving east, especially in Pennsylvania. To the northeast it is found in western New York and much of Vermont, and it intergrades extensively with the eastern subspecies.

The southern painted turtle ranges from extreme southern Illinois and Missouri, roughly along the Mississippi River Valley, to the south. In Arkansas, it branches out to the west towards Texas, where it is found in the far northeast part of that state (<a href="Caddo%20Lake">Caddo Lake</a> region) as well as extreme southeastern Oklahoma (<a href="McCurtain%20County">McCurtain County</a>). It is found in much of Louisiana, where it reaches the Gulf of Mexico (in fresh water). Eastward it is found in western Tennessee, northern Mississippi and much of Alabama, including the Gulf Coast city of <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile</a> An isolated population in central Texas has been reported but is now believed to be non-native.

The western painted turtle's northern range includes southern parts of western Canada from Ontario through Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. In Ontario, the western subspecies is found north of Minnesota and directly north of Lake Superior, but there is a gap to the east of Lake Superior (in the area of harshest winter climate) where no painted turtles of any subspecies occur. Thus Ontario's western subspecies does not intergrade with the midland painted turtle of southeastern Ontario. In Manitoba, the turtle is numerous and ranges north to <a href="Lake%20Manitoba">Lake Manitoba</a> and the lower part of <a href="Lake%20Winnipeg">Lake Winnipeg</a>. The turtle is also common in south Saskatchewan, but in Alberta, there may only be 100 individuals, all found very near the U.S. border, mostly in the southeast.

In British Columbia, populations exist in the interior in the vicinity of the Kootenai, Columbia, Okanagan, and Thompson river valleys. At the coast, turtles occur near the mouth of the Fraser and a bit further north, as well as the bottom of Vancouver Island, and some other nearby islands. Within British Columbia, the turtle's range is not continuous and can better be understood as northward extensions of the range from the United States. High mountains present barriers to east-west movement of the turtles within the province or from Alberta. Some literature has shown isolated populations much further north in British Columbia and Alberta, but these were probably pet-releases.

In the United States, the western subspecies forms a wide intergrade area with the midland subspecies covering much of Illinois as well as a strip of Wisconsin along <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> and part of the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper Peninsula of Michigan</a> (UP). Further west, the rest of Illinois, Wisconsin and the UP are part of the range proper, as are all of Minnesota and Iowa, as well as all of Missouri except a narrow strip in the south. All of North Dakota is within range, all of South Dakota except a very small area in the west, and all of Nebraska. Almost all of Kansas is in range; the border of that state with Oklahoma is roughly the species range border, but the turtle is found in three counties of north central Oklahoma.

To the northwest, almost all of Montana is in range. Only a narrow strip in the west, along most of the Idaho border (which is at the <a href="Continental%20Divide">Continental Divide</a>) lacks turtles. Wyoming is almost entirely out of range; only the lower elevation areas near the eastern and northern borders have painted turtles. In Idaho, the turtles are found throughout the far north (upper half of the <a href="Idaho%20Panhandle">Idaho Panhandle</a>). Recently, separate Idaho populations have been observed in the southwest (near the <a href="Payette%20River">Payette</a> and <a href="Boise%20River">Boise</a> rivers) and the southeast (near <a href="St.%20Anthony%2C%20Idaho">St. Anthony</a>). In Washington state, turtles are common throughout the state within lower elevation river valleys. In Oregon, the turtle is native to the northern part of the state throughout the Columbia River Valley as well as the Willamette River Valley north of Salem.

To the southwest, the painted turtle's range is fragmented. In Colorado, while range is continuous in the eastern, prairie, half of the state, it is absent in most of the western, mountainous, part of the state. However, the turtle is confirmed present in the lower elevation southwest part of the state (<a href="Archuleta%20County%2C%20Colorado">Archuleta</a> and <a href="La%20Plata%20County%2C%20Colorado">La Plata</a> counties), where a population ranges into northern New Mexico in the <a href="San%20Juan%20River%20%28Colorado%20River%29">San Juan River</a> basin. In New Mexico, the main distribution follows the <a href="Rio%20Grande">Rio Grande</a> and the <a href="Pecos%20River">Pecos River</a>, two waterways that run in a north-south direction through the state. Within the aforementioned rivers, it is also found in the northern part of <a href="Trans-Pecos">Far West Texas</a>. In Utah, the painted turtle lives in an area to the south (<a href="Kane%20County%2C%20Utah">Kane County</a>) in streams draining into the Colorado River, although it is disputed if they are native. In Arizona, the painted turtle is native to an area in the east, <a href="Lyman%20Reservoir">Lyman Lake</a>. The painted turtle is not native to Nevada or California.

In Mexico, painted turtles have been found about 50 miles south of New Mexico near <a href="Galeana%2C%20Chihuahua">Galeana</a> in the state of <a href="Chihuahua%20%28state%29">Chihuahua</a>. There, two expeditions found the turtles in the <a href="Santa%20Maria%20River%20%28Chihuahua%29">Rio Santa Maria</a> which is in a <a href="Endorheic%20basin">closed basin</a>.

Pet releases are starting to establish the painted turtle outside its native range. It has been introduced into waterways near <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix</a>, Arizona, and to Germany, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Spain.

To thrive, painted turtles need fresh waters with soft bottoms, basking sites, and <a href="Aquatic%20plant">aquatic vegetation</a>. They find their homes in shallow waters with slow-moving currents, such as creeks, marshes, ponds, and the shores of lakes. The subspecies have evolved different habitat preferences.


Within much of its range, the painted turtle is the most abundant turtle species. <a href="Population%20density">Population densities</a> range from 10 to 840 turtles per hectare (2.5 acres) of water surface. Warmer climates produce higher relative densities among populations, and habitat desirability also influences density. Rivers and large lakes have lower densities because only the shore is desirable habitat; the central, deep waters skew the surface-based estimates. Also, lake and river turtles have to make longer linear trips to access equivalent amounts of foraging space.

Adults outnumber juveniles in most populations, but gauging the ratios is difficult because juveniles are harder to catch; with current sampling methods, estimates of <a href="Population%20pyramid">age distribution</a> vary widely. <a href="Mortality%20rate">Annual survival rate</a> of painted turtles increases with age. The probability of a painted turtle surviving from the egg to its first birthday is only 19%. For females, the annual survival rate rises to 45% for juveniles and 95% for adults. The male survival rates follow a similar pattern, but are probably lower overall than females, as evidenced by the average male age being lower than that of the female. Natural disasters can confound age distributions. For instance, a hurricane can destroy many nests in a region, resulting in fewer hatchlings the next year. Age distributions may also be skewed by migrations of adults.

To understand painted turtle adult age distributions, researchers require reliable methods. Turtles younger than four years (up to 12 years in some populations) can be aged based on "<a href="growth%20ring">growth ring</a>s" in their shells. For older turtles, some attempts have been made to determine age based on size and shape of their shells or legs using <a href="mathematical%20model">mathematical model</a>s, but this method is more uncertain. The most reliable method to study the long-lived turtles is to capture them, permanently mark their shells by notching with a drill, release the turtles, and then recapture them in later years. The longest-running study, in Michigan, has shown that painted turtles can live more than 55 years.

Adult <a href="sex%20ratio">sex ratio</a>s of painted turtle populations average around 1:1. Many populations are slightly male-heavy, but some are strongly female-imbalanced; one population in Ontario has a female to male ratio of 4:1. Hatchling sex ratio <a href="temperature-dependent%20sex%20determination">varies based on egg temperature</a>. During the middle third of incubation, temperatures of produce males, and anything above or below that, females. It does not appear that females choose nesting sites to influence the sex of the hatchlings; within a population, nests will vary sufficiently to give both male and female-heavy broods.
The painted turtle ("C. picta") is the <a href="Monotypic%20taxon">only species</a> in the genus "Chrysemys". The parent family for "Chrysemys" is Emydidae: the pond turtles. Emydidae is split into two sub families; "Chrysemys" is part of the <a href="Deirochelyinae">Deirochelyinae</a> (Western Hemisphere) branch. The four subspecies of the painted turtle are the eastern ("C. p. picta"), midland ("C. p. marginata"), southern ("C. p. dorsalis"), and western ("C. p. bellii").

The painted turtle's <a href="Genus%20%28biology%29">generic</a> name is derived from the Ancient Greek words for "gold" ("chryso") and "freshwater tortoise" ("emys"); the <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">species name</a> originates from the Latin for "colored" ("pictus"). The subspecies name, "marginata", derives from the Latin for "border" and refers to the red markings on the outer (marginal) part of the upper shell; "dorsalis" is from the Latin for "back", referring to the prominent <a href="Dorsum%20%28biology%29">dorsal</a> stripe; and "bellii" honors English zoologist <a href="Thomas%20Bell%20%28zoologist%29">Thomas Bell</a>, a collaborator of <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>. An alternate East Coast common name for the painted turtle is "skilpot", from the Dutch for turtle, "schildpad".

Originally described in 1783 by <a href="Johann%20Gottlob%20Schneider">Johann Gottlob Schneider</a> as "Testudo picta", the painted turtle was called "Chrysemys picta" first by <a href="John%20Edward%20Gray">John Edward Gray</a> in 1855. The four subspecies were then recognized: the eastern by Schneider in 1783, the western by Gray in 1831, and the midland and southern by <a href="Louis%20Agassiz">Louis Agassiz</a> in 1857.

Until the 1930s many of the subspecies of the painted turtle were labeled by biologists as full species within "Chrysemys", but this varied by the researcher. The painted turtles in the border region between the western and midland subspecies were sometimes considered a full species, "treleasei". In 1931, <a href="Sherman%20C.%20Bishop">Bishop</a> and <a href="Franklin%20J.%20W.%20Schmidt">Schmidt</a> defined the current "four in one" taxonomy of species and subspecies. Based on comparative measurements of turtles from throughout the range, they subordinated species to subspecies and eliminated "treleasei".

Since at least 1958, the subspecies were thought to have evolved in response to <a href="Allopatric%20speciation">geographic isolation</a> during the last ice age, 100,000 to 11,000 years ago. At that time painted turtles were divided into three different populations: eastern painted turtles along the southeastern Atlantic coast; southern painted turtles around the southern Mississippi River; and western painted turtles in the southwestern United States. The populations were not completely isolated for sufficiently long, hence wholly different species never evolved. When the glaciers retreated, about 11,000 years ago, all three subspecies moved north. The western and southern subspecies met in Missouri and <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridized</a> to produce the midland painted turtle, which then moved east and north through the Ohio and Tennessee river basins.

Biologists have long debated the genera of closely related subfamily-mates "Chrysemys," "<a href="Pseudemys">Pseudemys</a>" (cooters), and "<a href="Trachemys">Trachemys</a>" (sliders). After 1952, some combined "Pseudemys" and "Chrysemys" because of similar appearance. In 1964, based on measurements of the skull and feet, <a href="Samuel%20B.%20McDowell">Samuel B. McDowell</a> proposed all three genera be merged into one. However, further measurements, in 1967, contradicted this <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> arrangement. Also in 1967, <a href="J.%20Alan%20Holman">J. Alan Holman</a>, a paleontologist and herpetologist, pointed out that, although the three turtles were often found together in nature and had similar mating patterns, they did not <a href="crossbreed">crossbreed</a>. In the 1980s, studies of turtles' cell structures, biochemistries, and parasites further indicated that "Chrysemys," "Pseudemys," and "Trachemys" should remain in separate genera.

David E. Starkey and collaborators advanced a new view of the subspecies in 2003. Based on a study of the <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a>, they rejected the glacial development theory and argued that the southern painted turtle should be elevated to a separate species, "C. dorsalis", while the other subspecies should be collapsed into one and not differentiated. However, this proposition was largely unrecognized because successful breeding between all subspecies was documented wherever they overlapped. Nevertheless, in 2010, the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> recognized both "C. dorsalis" and "C. p. dorsalis" as valid names for the southern painted turtle.

Although its evolutionary history—what the forerunner to the species was and how the close relatives branched off—is not well understood, the painted turtle is common in the fossil record. The oldest samples, found in Nebraska, date to about 15 million years ago. Fossils from 15 million to about 5 million years ago are restricted to the Nebraska-Kansas area, but more recent fossils are gradually more widely distributed. Fossils newer than 300,000 years old are found in almost all the United States and southern Canada.

The turtle's <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a> (nuclear DNA, rather than mitochondrial DNA) consists of 50 <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s, the same number as the rest of its subfamily-mates and the most common number for Emydidae turtles in general. Less well-related turtles have from 26 to 66 chromosomes. Little systematic study of variations of the painted turtle's karotype among populations has been done. (However, in 1967, research on "protein" structure of offshore island populations in New England, showed differences from mainland turtles.)

Comparison of subspecies chromosomal DNA has been discussed, to help address the debate over Starkey's proposed taxonomy, but as of 2009 had not been reported. The complete sequencing of the genetic code for the painted turtle was at a "draft assembled" state in 2010. The turtle was one of two reptiles chosen to be first sequenced.

The species is currently classified as <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a> by the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> but populations have been subject to decline locally.

The decline in painted turtle populations is not a simple matter of dramatic range reduction, like that of the . Instead the turtle is classified as G5 (demonstrably widespread) in its <a href="NatureServe%20conservation%20status">Natural Heritage Global Rank</a>, and the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> rates it as a species of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>. The painted turtle's high reproduction rate and its ability to survive in polluted wetlands and artificially made ponds have allowed it to maintain its range, but the post-Columbus settlement of North America has reduced its numbers.

Only within the Pacific Northwest is the turtle's range eroding. Even there, in Washington, the painted turtle is designated S5 (demonstrably widespread). However, in Oregon, the painted turtle is designated S2 (imperiled), and in British Columbia, the turtle's populations in the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Coast">Coast</a> and <a href="British%20Columbia%20Interior">Interior</a> regions are labeled "endangered" and "of special concern", respectively.

Much is written about the different factors that threaten the painted turtle, but they are unquantified, with only inferences of relative importance. A primary threat category is habitat loss in various forms. Related to water habitat, there is drying of <a href="Wetlands%20of%20the%20United%20States">wetlands</a>, clearing of aquatic logs or rocks (basking sites), and clearing of shoreline vegetation, which allows more predator access or increased human foot traffic. Related to nesting habitat, urbanization or planting can remove needed sunny soils.

Another significant human impact is roadkill—dead turtles, especially females, are commonly seen on summer roads. In addition to direct killing, roads <a href="Genetic%20isolate">genetically isolate</a> some populations. Localities have tried to limit roadkill by constructing underpasses, highway barriers, and crossing signs. Oregon has introduced public education on turtle awareness, safe swerving, and safely assisting turtles across the road.

In the West, human-introduced bass, bullfrogs, and especially snapping turtles, have increased the predation of hatchlings. Outside the Southeast, where <a href="Pond%20slider">sliders</a> are native, released pet <a href="red-eared%20slider">red-eared slider</a> turtles increasingly compete with painted turtles. In cities, increased urban predators (raccoons, canines, and felines) may impact painted turtles by eating their eggs.

Other factors of concern for the painted turtles include over-collection from the wild, released pets introducing diseases or reducing <a href="genetic%20variability">genetic variability</a>, pollution, boating traffic, angler's hooks (the turtles are noteworthy bait-thieves), wanton shooting, and crushing by agricultural machines or golf course lawnmowers or <a href="all-terrain%20vehicle">all-terrain vehicle</a>s. Gervais and colleagues note that research itself impacts the populations and that much funded turtle trapping work has not been published. They advocate discriminating more on what studies are done, thereby putting fewer turtles into scientists' traps. <a href="Global%20warming">Global warming</a> represents an uncharacterized future threat.

As the most common turtle in <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, the eastern painted turtle is not listed under the Species at Risk Act for conservation requirements.

According to a trade data study, painted turtles were the second most popular pet turtles after red-eared sliders in the early 1990s. As of 2010, most U.S. states allow, but discourage, painted turtle pets, although Oregon forbids keeping them as pets, and Indiana prohibits their sale. U.S. federal law prohibits sale or transport of any turtle less than , to limit human contact to <a href="salmonella">salmonella</a>. However, a loophole for scientific samples allows some small turtles to be sold, and <a href="Wildlife%20trade%23Illegal%20wildlife%20trade">illegal trafficking</a> also occurs.

Painted turtle pet-keeping requirements are similar to those of the red-eared slider. Keepers are urged to provide them with adequate space and a basking site, and water that is regularly filtered and changed. According to <a href="Petco">Petco</a>, the animals are described as being somewhat unsuitable for children as they do not enjoy being held. Hobbyists have kept turtles alive for decades.

The painted turtle is sometimes eaten but is not highly regarded as food, as even the largest subspecies, the western painted turtle, is inconveniently small and larger turtles are available. Schools frequently dissect painted turtles, which are sold by <a href="biological%20supply%20industry">biological supply</a> companies; specimens often come from the wild but may be captive-bred. In the Midwest, <a href="turtle%20racing">turtle racing</a> is popular at summer fairs.

Commercial harvesting of painted turtles in the wild is controversial and, increasingly, restricted. Wisconsin formerly had virtually unrestricted trapping of painted turtles but based on qualitative observations forbade all commercial harvesting in 1997. Neighboring Minnesota, where trappers collected more than 300,000 painted turtles during the 1990s, commissioned a study of painted turtle harvesting. Scientists found that harvested lakes averaged half the painted turtle density of off-limit lakes, and population modeling suggested that unrestricted harvests could produce a large decline in turtle populations. In response, Minnesota forbade new harvesters in 2002 and limited trap numbers. Although harvesting continued, subsequent takes averaged half those of the 1990s. As of 2009, painted turtles faced virtually unlimited harvesting in Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Ohio, and Oklahoma; since then, Missouri has prohibited their harvesting.

Individuals who trap painted turtles typically do so to earn additional income, selling a few thousand a year at $1–2 each. Many trappers have been involved in the trade for generations, and value it as a family activity. Some harvesters disagree with limiting the catch, saying the populations are not dropping.

Many U.S. state <a href="fish%20and%20game%20department">fish and game department</a>s allow non-commercial taking of painted turtles under a <a href="Creel%20%28basket%29">creel</a> limit, and require a fishing (sometimes hunting) license; others completely forbid the recreational capture of painted turtles. Trapping is not allowed in Oregon, where western painted turtle populations are in decline, and in Missouri, where there are populations of both southern and western subspecies. In Canada, Ontario protects both subspecies present, the midland and western, and British Columbia protects its dwindling western painted turtles.

Capture methods are also regulated by locality. Typically trappers use either floating "basking traps" or partially submerged, baited "hoop traps". Trapper opinions, commercial records, and scientific studies show that basking traps are more effective for collecting painted turtles, while the hoop traps work better for collecting "meat turtles" (snapping turtles and <a href="Trionychidae">soft-shell turtles</a>). Nets, hand capture, and fishing with <a href="Dropline">set lines</a> are generally legal, but shooting, chemicals, and explosives are forbidden.

<a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Indian</a> tribes were familiar with the painted turtle—young braves were trained to recognize its splashing into water as an alarm—and incorporated it in folklore. A <a href="Potawatomi">Potawatomi</a> myth describes how the talking turtles, "Painted Turtle" and allies "Snapping Turtle" and "<a href="box%20turtle">Box Turtle</a>", outwit the village women. Painted Turtle is the star of the legend and uses his distinctive markings to trick a woman into holding him so he can bite her. An <a href="Illiniwek">Illini</a> myth recounts how Painted Turtle put his paint on to entice a chief's daughter into the water.

As of 2010, four U.S. states designated the painted turtle as <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20reptiles">official reptile</a>. Vermont honored the reptile in 1994, following the suggestion of <a href="Cornwall%20Elementary%20School">Cornwall Elementary School</a> students. In 1995, Michigan followed, based on the recommendation of <a href="Niles%2C%20Michigan">Niles</a> fifth graders, who discovered the state lacked an official reptile. Illinois citizens, in 2004, voted to select the painted turtle as their state reptile and the legislature made it official in 2005. Colorado chose the western painted turtle in 2008, following the efforts of two succeeding years of Jay Biachi's fourth grade classes. In New York, the painted turtle narrowly lost (5,048 to 5,005, versus the common snapping turtle) a 2006 statewide student election for state reptile.

In the border town of <a href="Boissevain%2C%20Manitoba">Boissevain</a>, Manitoba, a western painted turtle, "Tommy the Turtle", is a roadside attraction. The statue was built in 1974 to celebrate the Canadian Turtle Derby, a festival including <a href="Turtle%20racing">turtle races</a> that ran from 1972–2001.

Another Canadian admirer of the painted turtle is <a href="Jon%20Montgomery">Jon Montgomery</a>, who won the 2010 Olympic gold medal in <a href="Skeleton%20%28sport%29">skeleton</a> (a form of sled) racing, while wearing a painted turtle painting on the crown of his helmet, prominently visible when he slid downhill. Montgomery, who also iconically tattoed his chest with a maple-leaf, explained his visual promotion of the turtle, saying that he had assisted one to cross the road. <a href="BC%20Hydro">BC Hydro</a> referred to Montgomery's action when describing its own sponsorship of conservation research for the turtle in British Columbia.

Several private entities use the painted turtle as a symbol. <a href="Wayne%20State%20University%20Press">Wayne State University Press</a> operates an imprint "named after the Michigan state reptile" that "publishes books on regional topics of cultural and historical interest". In California, <a href="The%20Painted%20Turtle">The Painted Turtle</a> is a camp for ill children, founded by <a href="Paul%20Newman">Paul Newman</a>. Painted Turtle Winery of British Columbia trades on the "laid back and casual lifestyle" of the turtle with a "job description to bask in the sun". Also, there is an Internet company in Michigan, a guesthouse in British Columbia, and a café in Maine that use the painted turtle commercially.

In children's books, the painted turtle is a popular subject, with at least seven books published between 2000 and 2010.

Volubilis

Volubilis (, ) is a partly excavated Berber city in <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> situated near the city of <a href="Meknes">Meknes</a>, and commonly considered as the ancient capital of the <a href="Mauretania">kingdom of Mauretania</a>. Built in a fertile agricultural area, it developed from the 3rd century BC onward as a Berber, then proto-<a href="Ancient%20Carthage">Carthaginian</a>, settlement before being the capital of the kingdom of Mauretania. It grew rapidly under Roman rule from the 1st century AD onward and expanded to cover about with a circuit of walls. The city gained a number of major public buildings in the 2nd century, including a <a href="basilica">basilica</a>, <a href="Roman%20temple">temple</a> and <a href="triumphal%20arch">triumphal arch</a>. Its prosperity, which was derived principally from <a href="olive">olive</a> growing, prompted the construction of many fine town-houses with large <a href="Roman%20mosaic">mosaic</a> floors.

The city fell to local tribes around 285 and was never retaken by Rome because of its remoteness and indefensibility on the south-western border of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>. It continued to be inhabited for at least another 700 years, first as a Latinised Christian community, then as an early Islamic settlement. In the late 8th century it became the seat of <a href="Idris%20I%20of%20Morocco">Idris ibn Abdallah</a>, the founder of the <a href="Idrisid%20dynasty">Idrisid dynasty</a> and the state of Morocco. By the 11th century Volubilis had been abandoned after the seat of power was relocated to Fes. Much of the local population was transferred to the new town of <a href="Moulay%20Idriss%20Zerhoun">Moulay Idriss Zerhoun</a>, about from Volubilis.

The ruins remained substantially intact until they were devastated by an earthquake in the mid-18th century and subsequently looted by Moroccan rulers seeking stone for building Meknes. It was not until the latter part of the 19th century that the site was definitively identified as that of the ancient city of Volubilis. During and after the period of French rule over Morocco, about half of the site was excavated, revealing many fine mosaics, and some of the more prominent public buildings and high-status houses were restored or reconstructed. Today it is a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>, listed for being "an exceptionally well preserved example of a large Roman colonial town on the fringes of the Empire".

Built on a shallow slope below the <a href="Zerhoun">Zerhoun mountain</a>, Volubilis stands on a ridge above the valley of Khoumane (Xuman). It overlooks a rolling fertile plain north of the modern city of Meknes. The area around Volubilis has been inhabited at least since the <a href="Atlantic%20%28period%29">Late Atlantic</a> <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a>, some 5,000 years ago; archaeological excavations at the site have found Neolithic pottery of design comparable to pieces found in <a href="Iberia">Iberia</a>. By the third century BC, the <a href="Phoenicians">Phoenicians</a> had a presence there, as evidenced by the remains of a temple to the <a href="Religion%20in%20Carthage">Punic god</a> <a href="Baal">Baal</a> and finds of pottery and stones inscribed in the <a href="Phoenician%20language">Phoenician language</a>. The origins of its name are unknown but may be a <a href="Latinisation%20of%20names">Latinisation</a> of the <a href="Berber%20languages">Berber</a> word "Walilt", meaning <a href="oleander">oleander</a>, which grows along the sides of the valley.

The city lay within the kingdom of <a href="Mauretania">Mauretania</a>, which became a Roman <a href="client%20state">client state</a> following the fall of <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a> in 146 BC. The <a href="Punics">Punic</a> influence lasted for a considerable time afterwards, as the city's magistrates retained the Carthaginian title of "<a href="suffete">suffete</a>" long after the end of Punic rule. <a href="Juba%20II">Juba II</a> of <a href="Numidia">Numidia</a> was placed on the Mauretanian throne by <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a> in 25 BC and turned his attention to building a royal capital at Volubilis. Educated in Rome and married to <a href="Cleopatra%20Selene%20II">Cleopatra Selene II</a>, the daughter of <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a> and <a href="Cleopatra">Cleopatra</a>, Juba and his son <a href="Ptolemy%20of%20Mauretania">Ptolemy</a> were thoroughly Romanised kings, although of <a href="Berbers">Berber</a> ancestry; their preference for <a href="Roman%20art">Roman art</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Roman%20architecture">architecture</a> was clearly reflected in the city's design.

After <a href="Claudius">Claudius</a> annexed Mauretania in 44 AD, the city grew substantially due to its wealth and prosperity, derived from the fertile lands of the province which produced valuable export commodities such as grain, <a href="olive%20oil">olive oil</a> and wild animals for <a href="gladiator">gladiator</a>ial spectacles. At its peak in the late 2nd century, Volubilis had around 20,000 inhabitants – a very substantial population for a Roman provincial town – and the surrounding region was also well inhabited, to judge from over 50 <a href="Roman%20villa">villas</a> discovered in the area. It was mentioned by the 1st century AD geographer <a href="Pomponius%20Mela">Pomponius Mela</a>, who described it in his work "De situ orbis libri III" as one of "the wealthiest cities, albeit the wealthiest among small ones" in Mauretania. It is also mentioned by <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, and the 2nd century <a href="Antonine%20Itinerary">Antonine Itinerary</a> refers to its location and names it as "Volubilis Colonia". Its population was dominated by Romanised Berbers.

The city became the administrative centre of the Roman province of <a href="Mauretania%20Tingitana">Mauretania Tingitana</a>. It remained loyal to Rome despite a revolt in 40–44 AD led by one of Ptolemy's <a href="freedman">freedmen</a>, <a href="Aedemon">Aedemon</a>, and its inhabitants were rewarded with grants of citizenship and a ten-year exemption from taxes. The city was raised to the status of a "<a href="municipium">municipium</a>" and its system of governance was overhauled, with the Punic-style "suffetes" replaced by annually elected "<a href="duumvir">duumvir</a>s", or pairs of magistrates. However, the city's position was always tenuous; it was located on the south-eastern edge of the province, facing hostile and increasingly powerful Berber tribes. A ring of five <a href="Castra">forts</a> located at the modern hamlets of <a href="A%C3%AFn%20Schkor">Aïn Schkor</a>, <a href="Bled%20el%20Gaada">Bled el Gaada</a>, <a href="Sidi%20Moussa%2C%20Morocco">Sidi Moussa</a>, <a href="Sidi%20Said%2C%20Morocco">Sidi Said</a> and <a href="Bled%20Takourart">Bled Takourart</a> (ancient <a href="Tocolosida">Tocolosida</a>) were constructed to bolster the city's defence. Sidi Said was the base for the <a href="Cohors%20IV%20Gallorum%20equitata">Cohors IV Gallorum equitata</a>, an <a href="Auxiliaries%20%28Roman%20military%29">auxiliary cavalry</a> unit from <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a>, while Aïn Schkor housed <a href="Hispania">Hispanic</a> and <a href="Belgae">Belgic</a> cohorts. Sidi Moussa was the location of a cohort of <a href="Parthia">Parthia</a>ns, and Gallic and Syrian cavalry were based at Toscolosida. Rising tensions in the region near the end of the 2nd century led the emperor <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a> to order the construction of a circuit of walls with eight gates and 40 towers. Volubilis was connected by road to <a href="Lixus%20%28ancient%20city%29">Lixus</a> and Tingis (modern <a href="Tangier">Tangier</a>) but had no eastwards connections with the neighbouring province of <a href="Mauretania%20Caesariensis">Mauretania Caesariensis</a>, as the territory of the Berber <a href="Barghawata">Baquates</a> tribe lay in between.

Rome's control over the city ended following the chaos of the <a href="Crisis%20of%20the%20Third%20Century">Crisis of the Third Century</a>, when the empire nearly disintegrated as a series of generals seized and lost power through civil wars, palace coups and assassinations. Around 280, Roman rule collapsed in much of Mauretania and was never re-established. In 285, the emperor <a href="Diocletian">Diocletian</a> reorganised what was left of the province to retain only the coastal strip between Lixus, Tingis and Septa (modern <a href="Ceuta">Ceuta</a>). Although a Roman army was based in <a href="Tingis">Tingis</a>, it was decided that it would simply be too expensive to mount a reconquest of a vulnerable border region. Occupation of the city continued, however, as fine mosaics such as that of a chariot race conducted by animals in the House of Venus can not have been created earlier than the fourth century. The end of the Roman city probably came in the form of an earthquake towards the end of the century, which buried numerous bronze statues in the wreckage of the houses.

Volubilis continued to be inhabited for centuries after the end of Roman control. It was certainly reoccupied in the sixth and seventh century, when three Christian inscriptions are dated by the provincial year. By the time the Arabs had arrived in 708, the city – its name was changed to "Oualila" or "Walīlī" – and it was inhabited by the Awraba, a Berber tribe that originated in <a href="Libya">Libya</a>. Much of the city centre had been abandoned and was turned into a cemetery, while the centre of habitation had moved to the southwest of the city, where a new wall was built to contain the abridged Roman town. 

Volubilis remained the capital of the region well into the Islamic period. Islamic coins dating to the 8th century have been found on the site, attesting to the arrival of Islam in this part of Morocco. They are concentrated outside the city walls, which suggests that Arab settlement remained distinct from the Berber settlement inside them. It was here that <a href="Idris%20I">Moulay Idriss</a> established the <a href="Idrisid%20dynasty">Idrisid dynasty</a> of <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> in 787-8. A direct descendant of the Islamic prophet, <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, he escaped to Morocco from <a href="Syria">Syria</a> following the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fakhkh">Battle of Fakhkh</a> in 787. He was proclaimed "<a href="imam">imam</a>" in Volubilis, occupied by the <a href="Awraba">Awraba</a>, under <a href="Ishaq%20ibn%20Mohammad">Ishaq ibn Mohammad</a>. He married Kanza, from the Awraba, and fathered a son, <a href="Idris%20II%20of%20Morocco">Idris II</a>, who was proclaimed <a href="imam">imam</a> in Volubilis. He, too, lived outside the walls of the city, along the banks of the Wadi Khoumane, where a complex has recently been excavated that may be identified with his headquarters. Idriss I conquered most of Northern Morocco during the three years of his reign, founding the city of <a href="Fez%2C%20Morocco">Fes</a>. He was assassinated in Volubilis in 791 on the orders of the <a href="caliph">caliph</a> of <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, <a href="Harun%20al-Rashid">Harun al-Rashid</a>. On his majority Idriss II removed to <a href="Fes">Fes</a> which served as his new capital, depriving Volubilis of its last vestiges of political significance.

A Muslim group known as the <a href="Rabedis">Rabedis</a>, who had revolted in <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Andalusia">Córdoba</a> in <a href="Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a> (<a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a> in modern Spain), resettled at Volubilis in 818. Although people continued to live in Volubilis for several more centuries, it was probably almost deserted by the 14th century. <a href="Leo%20Africanus">Leo Africanus</a> describes its walls and gates, as well as the tomb of Idris, guarded only by two or three castles. His body was subsequently removed to <a href="Moulay%20Idriss%20Zerhoun">Moulay Idriss Zerhoun</a>, , where a great mausoleum was built for it. The name of the city was forgotten and it was termed "Ksar Faraoun", or the "Pharaoh's Castle", by the local people, alluding to a legend that the ancient Egyptians had built it. Nonetheless some of its buildings remained standing, albeit ruined, until as late as the 17th century when <a href="Moulay%20Ismail">Moulay Ismail</a> ransacked the site to provide building material for his new imperial capital at Meknes. The <a href="1755%20Lisbon%20earthquake">1755 Lisbon earthquake</a> caused further severe destruction. However, English antiquarian <a href="John%20Windus">John Windus</a> had sketched the site in 1722. In his 1725 book "A Journey to Mequinez", Windus described the scene:

Visiting 95 years later in 1820, after the Lisbon earthquake had flattened the few buildings left standing, <a href="James%20Gray%20Jackson">James Gray Jackson</a> wrote:

<a href="Walter%20Burton%20Harris">Walter Burton Harris</a>, a writer for "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", visited Volubilis during his travels in Morocco between 1887–89, after the site had been identified by French archaeologists but before any serious excavations or restorations had begun. He wrote:

Much of Volubilis was excavated by the French during their rule over <a href="French%20Morocco">French Morocco</a> between 1912 and 1955, but the excavations at the site began decades earlier. From 1830, when the French conquest of <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a> began the process of extending French rule over much of northern, western and central Africa, archaeology was closely associated with French colonialism. The French army undertook scientific explorations as early as the 1830s and by the 1850s it was fashionable for French army officers to investigate Roman remains during their leave and spare time. By the late 19th century French archaeologists were undertaking an intensive effort to uncover north-west Africa's pre-Islamic past through excavations and restorations of archaeological sites. The French had a very different conception of historic preservation to that of the Moroccan Muslims. As the historian <a href="Gwendolyn%20Wright">Gwendolyn Wright</a> puts it, "the Islamic sense of history and architecture found the concept of setting off monuments entirely foreign", which "gave the French proof of the conviction that only they could fully appreciate the Moroccan past and its beauty." <a href="Emile%20Pauty">Emile Pauty</a> of the <a href="Institut%20des%20Hautes%20Etudes%20Marocaines">Institut des Hautes Etudes Marocaines</a> criticised the Muslims for taking the view that "the passage of time is nothing" and charged them with "let[ting] their monuments fall into ruin with as much indifference as they once showed ardour in building them."

The French programme of excavation at Volubilis and other sites in <a href="French%20North%20Africa">French-controlled North Africa</a> (in Algeria and <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>) had a strong ideological component. Archaeology at Roman sites was used as an instrument of colonialist policy, to make a connection between the ancient Roman past and the new "Latin" societies that the French were building in North Africa. The programme involved clearing modern structures built on ancient sites, excavating Roman towns and villas and reconstructing major civic structures such as triumphal arches. Ruined cities, such as <a href="Timgad">Timgad</a> in Algeria, were excavated and cleared on a massive scale. The remains were intended to serve, as one writer has put it, as "the witness to an impulse towards Romanization".

This theme resonated with other visitors to the site. The American writer <a href="Edith%20Wharton">Edith Wharton</a> visited in 1920 and highlighted what she saw as the contrast between "two dominations look[ing] at each other across the valley", the ruins of Volubilis and "the conical white town of Moulay Idriss, the Sacred City of Morocco". She saw the dead city as representing "a system, an order, a social conception that still runs through all our modern ways." In contrast, she saw the still very much alive town of Moulay Idriss as "more dead and sucked back into an unintelligible past than any broken architrave of Greece or Rome." As <a href="Sarah%20Bird%20Wright">Sarah Bird Wright</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Richmond">University of Richmond</a> puts it, Wharton saw Volubilis as a symbol of civilisation and Moulay Idriss as one of barbarism; the subtext is that "in ransacking the Roman outpost, Islam destroyed its only chance to build a civilised society". Fortunately for Morocco, "the political stability which France is helping them to acquire will at last give their higher qualities time for fruition"—very much the theme that the French colonial authorities wanted to get across. <a href="Hilaire%20Belloc">Hilaire Belloc</a>, too, spoke of his impression being "rather one of history and of contrast. Here you see how completely the new religion of Islam flooded and drowned the classical and Christian tradition."

The first excavations at Volubilis were carried out by the French archaeologist Henri de la Martinière between 1887 and 1892. In 1915 <a href="Hubert%20Lyautey">Hubert Lyautey</a>, the military governor of French Morocco, commissioned the French archaeologists <a href="Marcel-Auguste%20Dieulafoy">Marcel and Jane Dieulafoy</a> to carry out excavations in Volubilis. Although Jane's ill-health meant that they were unable to carry out the programme of work that they drew up for Lyautey, the work went ahead anyway under <a href="Louis%20Chatelain">Louis Chatelain</a>. The French archaeologists were assisted by thousands of German prisoners of war who had been captured during <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> and loaned to the excavators by Lyautey. The excavations continued on and off until 1941, when the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> forced a halt.

Following the war, excavations resumed under the French and Moroccan authorities (following Morocco's independence in 1955) and a programme of restoration and reconstruction began. The Arch of <a href="Caracalla">Caracalla</a> had already been restored in 1930–34. It was followed by the Capitoline Temple in 1962, the basilica in 1965–67 and the Tingis Gate in 1967. A number of mosaics and houses underwent conservation and restoration in 1952–55. In recent years, one of the oil production workshops in the southern end of the city has been restored and furnished with a replica Roman oil press. These restorations have not been without controversy; a review carried out for UNESCO in 1997 reported that "some of the reconstructions, such as those on the triumphal arch, the capitolium, and the oil-pressing workshop, are radical and at the limit of currently accepted practice."

From 2000 excavations carried out by <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a> and the Moroccan <a href="Institut%20National%20des%20Sciences%20de%20l%27Arch%C3%A9ologie%20et%20du%20Patrimoine">Institut National des Sciences de l'Archéologie et du Patrimoine</a> under the direction of <a href="Elizabeth%20Fentress">Elizabeth Fentress</a>, Gaetano Palumbo and Hassan Limane revealed what should probably be interpreted as the headquarters of Idris I just below the walls of the Roman town to the west of the ancient city centre. Excavations within the walls also revealed a section of the early medieval town. Today, many artefacts found at Volubilis can be seen on display in the <a href="Rabat%20Archaeological%20Museum">Rabat Archaeological Museum</a>.

UNESCO listed Volubilis as a World Heritage Site in 1997. In the 1980s, the <a href="International%20Council%20on%20Monuments%20and%20Sites">International Council on Monuments and Sites</a> (ICOMOS) organised three conferences to assess possible nominations to the World Heritage List for sites in North Africa. It was unanimously agreed that Volubilis was a good candidate for the list and in 1997 ICOMOS recommended that it be inscribed as "an exceptionally well preserved example of a large Roman colonial town on the fringes of the Empire", which UNESCO accepted.

Prior to the Roman occupation, Volubilis covered an area of about , built on a V-shaped ridge between the Fertassa and Khoumane wadis on a roughly north-south axis. It was developed on a fairly regular pattern typical of Phoenician/Carthaginian settlements and was enclosed by a set of walls. Under the Romans, the city was expanded considerably on a northeast-southwest axis, increasing in size to about . Most of the city's public buildings were constructed in the older part of the city. The grand houses for which Volubilis is famous are in the newer part, behind the Decumanus Maximus (main street), which bisected the Roman-era part of the city. The decumanus was paved, with footways on either side, and was lined with arcaded porticoes on either sides, behind which were dozens of shops. The Arch of Caracalla marks the point at which the old and new cities merge. After the <a href="Roman%20aqueduct">aqueduct</a> fell into disrepair with the end of the Roman occupation, a new residential area was constructed to the west near the Wadi Khoumane.

The city was supplied with water by an aqueduct that ran from a spring in the hills behind the city. The aqueduct may have been constructed around 60–80 AD and was subsequently reconstructed on several occasions. An elaborate network of channels fed houses and the public baths from the municipal supply and a series of drains carried sewage and waste away to the river to be flushed. The aqueduct ran under the Decumanus Secundus, a street that ran parallel with the Decumanus Maximus, and terminated at a large fountain in the city centre near the Arch of Caracalla.
Most of the original pre-Roman city wall was built over or destroyed, but a stretch of the original wall, which was made of mud bricks on a stone foundation, can still be seen near the tumulus. The Roman city walls stretch for and average thick. Built of rubble masonry and <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a>, they are mostly still extant. The full circuit of walls had 34 towers, spaced at intervals of about one every , and six main gates that were flanked by towers. A part of the eastern wall has been reconstructed to a height of . The Tingis Gate, also reconstructed, marks the northern-eastern entrance to Volubilis. It was constructed in 168/169 AD – the date is known due to the discovery of a coin of that year that was deliberately embedded in the gate's stonework by its builders.

An early medieval wall stands to the west of the Arch of Caracalla; it was built after the end of the Roman occupation, apparently some time in the 5th or 6th centuries, to protect the eastern side of the city's new residential area. It was oriented in a north-south direction and was constructed using stone looted from ruined buildings elsewhere in the abandoned areas of the city.

During Roman times, Volubilis was a major producer of olive oil. The remains of buildings dedicated to <a href="olive%20press">olive press</a>ing are still readily visible, as are the remains of the original presses and olive mills. One such building has been reconstructed with a full-size replica of a Roman olive press. Olive oil was central to the life of the city, as it was not just a foodstuff but was also used for lamps, bathing and medicines, while the pressed olives were fed to animals or dried out and used as fuel for the bathhouses. For this reason, even some of the grandest mansions had their own olive presses. Fifty-eight oil-pressing complexes have so far been discovered in Volubilis. They housed a standard set of elements: a mill, used to crush the olives, a decantation basin to catch the oil from pressed olives, and a press that comprised a counterweight, a "prelum" or cross-bar and the wooden supports within which the "prelum" was fixed. The olives were first crushed into a paste, then put into woven baskets that were subjected to pressing. The olive oil ran out into the decantation basin, to which water was periodically added to make the lighter oil float to the surface. This was then scooped out of the basin and poured into <a href="amphora">amphora</a>e. There is also substantial evidence of the city being a lively commercial centre. No fewer than 121 shops have been identified so far, many of them bakeries, and judging from the number of bronzes found at the site it may also have been a centre for the production or distribution of bronze artworks.

Although only about half of Volubilis has been excavated, a number of prominent public buildings are still visible and some, notably a <a href="basilica">basilica</a> and a <a href="triumphal%20arch">triumphal arch</a>, have been reconstructed. Many private buildings, including the mansions of the city's elite, have also been uncovered. They are especially notable for the fine mosaics that have been discovered in a number of buildings and which are still "in situ" in the houses where they were laid. The buildings were mostly made from locally quarried grey-blue <a href="limestone">limestone</a>. Very little remains of the original Punic settlement, as it lies under the later Roman buildings.

A large <a href="tumulus">tumulus</a> of uncertain origin and purpose stands approximately in the middle of the excavated area, between the old and new parts of the city. Various theories have been advanced to explain it, such as that it was a burial site, a religious structure of some kind, a funerary monument or a monument to a Roman victory. However, these remain unproven hypotheses.

Two major public buildings are readily visible at the centre of the city – the basilica and the Capitoline Temple. The basilica was used for the administration of justice and the governance of the city. Completed during the reign of <a href="Macrinus">Macrinus</a> in the early 3rd century, it is one of the finest Roman basilicas in Africa and is probably modelled on the one at <a href="Leptis%20Magna">Leptis Magna</a> in <a href="Libya">Libya</a>. The building is long by wide and originally had two storeys. Its interior is dominated by two rows of columns framing the apses at each end of the building where the magistrates sat. The outer wall of the basilica, which is faced with columns, overlooks the forum where markets were held. Small temples and public offices also lined the forum, which would have been full of statues of emperors and local dignitaries, of which only the pedestals now remain. Not much is known about the public buildings which existed in Volubilis prior to the start of the 3rd century, as the buildings currently visible were built on the foundations of earlier structures.

The Capitoline Temple stands behind the basilica within what would originally have been an arcaded courtyard. An altar stands in the courtyard in front of 13 steps leading up to the Corinthian-columned temple, which had a single <a href="cella">cella</a>. The building was of great importance to civic life as it was dedicated to the three chief divinities of the Roman state, <a href="Jupiter%20%28mythology%29">Jupiter</a>, <a href="Juno%20%28mythology%29">Juno</a> and <a href="Minerva">Minerva</a>. Civic assemblies were held in front of the temple to beseech the aid of the gods or to thank them for successes in major civic undertakings such as fighting wars. The layout of the temple, facing the back wall of the basilica, is somewhat unusual and it has been suggested that it may have been built on top of an existing shrine. An inscription found in 1924 records that it was reconstructed in 218. It was partly restored in 1955 and given a more substantial restoration in 1962, reconstructing 10 of the 13 steps, the walls of the cella and the columns. There were four more small shrines within the temple precinct, one of which was dedicated to <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a>.

There were five other temples in the city, of which the most notable is the so-called "Temple of Saturn" that stood on the eastern side of Volubilis. It appears to have been built on top of, or converted from, an earlier Punic temple, which may have been dedicated to Baal. It is a sanctuary with a surrounding wall and a three-sided portico. In its interior was a small temple with a cella built on a shallow podium. The temple's traditional identification with Saturn is purely hypothetical and has not generally been accepted.
Volubilis also possessed at least three sets of public baths. Some mosaics can still be seen in the Baths of <a href="Gallienus">Gallienus</a>, redecorated by that emperor in the 260s to become the city's most lavish baths. The nearby north baths were the largest in the city, covering an area of about . They were possibly built in the time of <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a>.

The Arch of Caracalla is one of Volubilis' most distinctive sights, situated at the end of the city's main street, the <a href="Decumanus%20Maximus">Decumanus Maximus</a>. Although it is not architecturally outstanding, the <a href="triumphal%20arch">triumphal arch</a> forms a striking visual contrast with the smaller Tingis Gate at the far end of the decumanus. It was built in 217 by the city's governor, Marcus Aurelius Sebastenus, to honour the emperor <a href="Caracalla">Caracalla</a> and his mother <a href="Julia%20Domna">Julia Domna</a>. Caracalla was himself a North African and had recently extended <a href="Roman%20citizenship">Roman citizenship</a> to the inhabitants of Rome's provinces. However, by the time the arch was finished both Caracalla and Julia had been murdered by a usurper.

The arch is constructed from local stone and was originally topped by a bronze chariot pulled by six horses. Statues of <a href="nymph">nymph</a>s poured water into carved marble basins at the foot of the arch. Caracalla and Julia Domna were represented on medallion busts, though these have been defaced. The monument was reconstructed by the French between 1930–34. However, the restoration is incomplete and of disputed accuracy. The inscription on the top of the arch was reconstructed from the fragments noticed by Windus in 1722, which had been scattered on the ground in front of the arch.

The inscription reads (after the abbreviations have been expanded):

IMPERATORI CAESARI MARCO AVRELLIO ANTONINO PIO FELICI AVGVSTO PARTHICO MAXIMO BRITTANICO MAXIMO GERMANICO MAXIMO
PONTIFICI MAXIMO TRIBVNITIA POTESTATE XX IMPERATORI IIII CONSVLI IIII PATRI PATRIAE PROCONSVLI ET IVLIAE AVGVSTAE PIAE FELICI MATRI

or, in translation:

For the emperor Caesar, Marcus Aurelius Antoninus [Caracalla], the pious, fortunate Augustus, <a href="Parthian%20war%20of%20Caracalla">greatest victor in Parthia</a>, <a href="Roman%20invasion%20of%20Caledonia%20208-210">greatest victor in Britain</a>, <a href="Caracalla%23In%20the%20Roman%20provinces">greatest victor in Germany</a>, "<a href="Pontifex%20Maximus">Pontifex Maximus</a>", holding <a href="tribune%20of%20the%20plebs">tribunician power</a> for the twentieth time, Emperor for the fourth time, Consul for the fourth time, <a href="Pater%20patriae">Father of the Country</a>, Proconsul, and for Julia Augusta <nowiki>[</nowiki><a href="Julia%20Domna">Julia Domna</a><nowiki>]</nowiki>, the pious, fortunate mother of the camp and the Senate and the country, because of his exceptional and new kindness towards all, which is greater than that of the "<a href="Princeps">principes</a>" that came before, the Republic of the Volubilitans took care to have this arch made from the ground up, including a chariot drawn by six horses and all the ornaments, with Marcus Aurelius Sebastenus, "procurator", who is most deeply devoted to the divinity of Augustus, initiating and dedicating it.

The houses found at Volubilis range from richly decorated mansions to simple two-room mud-brick structures used by the city's poorer inhabitants. The city's considerable wealth is attested by the elaborate design of the houses of the wealthy, some of which have large mosaics still "in situ". They have been named by archaeologists after their principal mosaics (or other finds):



The same building was also the site of the discovery in 1918 of a bronze bust of outstanding quality depicting <a href="Cato%20the%20Younger">Cato the Younger</a>. One of the most notable artefacts discovered at Volubilis, it is now on display in the Archaeological Museum in Rabat. It was still on its original pedestal when it was found by archaeologists. The bust has been dated to the time of <a href="Nero">Nero</a> or <a href="Vespasian">Vespasian</a> and may be a copy of a bust created in Cato's lifetime or shortly thereafter. Its inscription identifies its subject as the orator. Another outstanding bust, depicting a Hellenistic prince, was discovered in a bakery across the street. It seems to have been made at the same time as the Cato bust and may well have come from the House of Venus, where an empty pedestal in another room suggests that the Cato had a companion piece. The bust, which is also on display in Rabat, is usually identified as Juba II but other possibilities include <a href="Hiero%20II">Hiero II</a> of <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse</a>, <a href="Cleomenes%20III">Cleomenes III</a> of <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>, <a href="Juba%20I">Juba I</a> or <a href="Hannibal">Hannibal</a>.

Just outside the walls of the city, on the floodplain of the Oued Khoumane, was found a series of interlocking courtyard buildings, of which the largest contained a hammam, or bath. This is an L-shaped structure, with a cold room paved with flagstones and benches running along the sides. At the end is found a plunge pool with three steps leading into it. From the cold room one moved to a vestibule at the corner of the building, decorated with a relief of a shield taken from the Arch of Caracalla. From there, one moved into the warm room, still covered by a vault, and finally into the hot room. The vault of this has now been restored, but it is possible to see the channels in the floor through which the hot air passed. Beyond this a furnace heated the room, as well as the hot water which would have flowed into basins in the corners. The courtyard of which this hammam formed the western limit was large, and contained numerous large silos for grain storage. To the south of this courtyard was one evidently designed for reception, with long narrow rooms to the east and west, one of which was painted red, with a low bench or divan at one end. Further south a third courtyard, only partially excavated, seems to have been devoted to domestic use. The plan, with its large courtyards and narrow rooms, is very different from the contemporary one or two-roomed structures inside the walls, probably inhabited by the Berbers of the Awraba tribe. It is dated by coins and pottery to the reign of Idris I, and has been identified as his headquarters .

Typhoon Gay (1989)

Typhoon Gay, also known as the Kavali Cyclone of 1989, was a small but powerful <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> that caused more than 800 fatalities in and around the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Thailand">Gulf of Thailand</a> in November 1989. The worst typhoon to affect the <a href="Malay%20Peninsula">Malay Peninsula</a> in 35 years, Gay originated from a <a href="monsoon%20trough">monsoon trough</a> over the Gulf of Thailand in early-November. Owing to favorable atmospheric conditions, the storm <a href="Rapid%20deepening">rapidly intensified</a>, attaining winds of more than 120 km/h (75 mph) by 3 November. Later that day, Gay became the first typhoon since 1891 to make <a href="Landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> in Thailand, striking <a href="Chumphon%20Province">Chumphon Province</a> with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). The small storm emerged into the <a href="Bay%20of%20Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a> and gradually reorganized over the following days as it approached southeastern <a href="India">India</a>. On 8 November, Gay attained its peak intensity as a <a href="SSHS%23Category%205">Category 5–equivalent</a> cyclone with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph). The typhoon then moved ashore near <a href="Kavali">Kavali</a>, <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>. Rapid weakening ensued inland, and Gay dissipated over <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> early on 10 November.

The typhoon's rapid development took hundreds of vessels in the Gulf of Thailand by surprise, leading to 275 offshore fatalities. Of these, 91 occurred after an oil drilling ship, the "<a href="Drillship%20Seacrest">Seacrest</a>", capsized amid swells. Across the Malay Peninsula, 588 people died from various storm-related incidents. Several towns in coastal Chumphon were destroyed. Losses throughout Thailand totaled (). Striking India as a powerful cyclone, Gay damaged or destroyed about 20,000 homes in <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>, leaving 100,000 people homeless. In that country, 69 deaths and () in damage were attributed to Gay.

In early November, a <a href="monsoon%20trough">monsoon trough</a> over the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Thailand">Gulf of Thailand</a> showed signs of <a href="tropical%20cyclogenesis">tropical cyclogenesis</a>. A small, concentrated area of <a href="Atmospheric%20convection">convection</a> quickly developed over a <a href="low-pressure%20area">low-pressure area</a> within the trough, and on November 2, the system became sufficiently organized for the <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)</a> to issue a <a href="Tropical%20Cyclone%20Formation%20Alert">Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert</a>. Owing to its small size, the system began strengthening within the narrow gulf by taking advantage of warm waters and good <a href="Outflow%20%28meteorology%29">outflow</a>. Moving generally northwestward, it became a tropical depression later that day and underwent <a href="Rapid%20deepening">rapid intensification</a>. As the newly named Tropical Storm Gay strengthened, it "presented a paradox to forecasters", according to <a href="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</a> Dianne K. Crittenden; <a href="Synoptic%20scale%20meteorology">synoptic data</a> from <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> and <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> indicated decreasing wind speeds and increasing <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a>s around the storm, but these observations were later interpreted as increased <a href="Subsidence%20%28atmosphere%29">subsidence</a>.

Strengthening faster than anticipated, Gay attained typhoon status early on 3 November. Later that day, the storm developed an <a href="Eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> before passing over the "Seacrest", an oil drilling ship. On 4 November, Gay's winds increased to 185 km/h (115 mph), equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane on the <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale">Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale</a>, before making <a href="Landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> in <a href="Chumphon%20Province">Chumphon Province</a>, <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, at 0600 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a>. The <a href="Japan%20Meteorological%20Agency">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> assessed that the storm had ten-minute sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) and a pressure of 960 <a href="Bar%20%28unit%29">mbar</a> (<a href="Pascal%20%28unit%29">hPa</a>; 28.35 <a href="Inches%20of%20Mercury">inHg</a>). Crossing the <a href="Kra%20Isthmus">Kra Isthmus</a>, Gay weakened to minimal typhoon status as it entered the <a href="Bay%20of%20Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a>. According to the <a href="India%20Meteorological%20Department">India Meteorological Department (IMD)</a>, Gay was the first typhoon since 1891 to form in the Gulf of Thailand and enter the Bay of Bengal. Responding to a <a href="Ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a> to its north, Gay maintained a west-northwestward to northwestward track for the next four days. The storm gradually restrengthened as it moved through an area of low <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> and warm waters; however, this was limited by restrictions to the cyclone's outflow. Early on November 6, Gay passed near the <a href="Andaman%20Islands">Andaman Islands</a> as a <a href="SSHS%23Category%202">Category 2-equivalent</a> cyclone.
After changing little in intensity for much of 6 November, Gay strengthened as the ridge to its north intensified and the previous restrictions to its outflow diminished. The storm moved due west through a small fetch of warmer waters, fueling the process of intensification over the next 42 hours. Based on estimates provided through the use of the <a href="Dvorak%20technique">Dvorak technique</a>, the JTWC assessed Gay to have attained its peak intensity as a <a href="SSHS%23Category%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B5">Category 5-equivalent</a> cyclone with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph) early on November 8. Around this time, the IMD estimated that the storm had three-minute sustained winds of 240 km/h (145 mph), classifying Gay as a modern-day Super Cyclonic Storm. Additionally, the agency estimated the cyclone's central pressure to have decreased to 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46 inHg). Around 1800 UTC, Gay made landfall over a sparsely populated area near <a href="Kavali">Kavali</a>, India, in <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>. Upon coming ashore, the storm's eye was about 20 km (12 mi) wide, with gale-force winds within 95 km (60 mi) of the center. Now over land, Gay no longer had access to warm waters, causing it to weaken to a tropical storm less than 12 hours after landfall. The storm continued to deteriorate while moving across India, before it completely dissipated over <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> on 10 November.

The most powerful storm to affect the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Thailand">Gulf of Thailand</a> in more than 35 years, Gay produced <a href="Swell%20%28ocean%29">swells</a> that caught many ships in the region off-guard. At least 16 vessels were reported missing by 5 November, including the <a href="Unocal%20Corporation">Unocal Corporation</a> oil drilling ship "<a href="Drillship%20Seacrest">Seacrest</a>". According to survivors, the vessel received no warning of the developing typhoon. Just when all crew members were about to abandon ship, the eye of Typhoon Gay passed over. Winds fluctuated violently and changed direction, preventing the ship from remaining stabilized despite being within safe operating limits. The vessel abruptly capsized with all 97 crew members on board during the overnight hours of 3 November, before any life boats could be deployed. Initial rescue attempts on 4 November were hampered by rough seas. Two days after the sinking, four rescue ships and two helicopters in the region were searching for survivors; four people were rescued from the wreckage on 6 November. Divers from the Thai Navy were sent to search the capsized vessel for anyone trapped inside. Of the crew, only 6 survived; 25 bodies were recovered, and the remaining 66 members were presumed dead. Losses from the sinking of the "Seacrest" totaled $40 million. Another 20 cargo and fishing ships sank during the storm, resulting in 140 fatalities.

Striking Thailand with unprecedented strength, Typhoon Gay caused damage across many of its provinces. Areas between Chumphon and Rayong Provinces were severely affected by heavy rains, high winds and large swells. Rainfall amounts peaked at Chumphon, where fell during the cyclone's passage. Widespread disruption of communication and electricity occurred in most areas south of <a href="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>; many households remained without power for weeks. Damaging winds uprooted numerous trees and power poles and toppled wooden houses built on stilts. Exacerbated by <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>, <a href="flash%20flood">flash flood</a>ing triggered by the storm damaged or destroyed thousands of homes and caused at least 365 fatalities. Several towns and villages across Chumphon province were devastated, and one of the destroyed villages "looked like it had been bombed" according to the "<a href="Bangkok%20Post">Bangkok Post</a>". Entire districts were reportedly "flattened" in Chumphon and Prachuap Khiri Khan Provinces. The typhoon destroyed many schools across Chumphon and Surat Thani Provinces, many of which were constructed of wood. All structures close to the storm's path had their windows and doors blown out, and some multi-story buildings lost their upper floors. A few schools constructed from reinforced concrete sustained little damage. Over 1,000 roads and 194 bridges were damaged or washed away. At the height of the floods, over 250,000 hectares (618,000 acres) of land was under water. Onshore, 558 fatalities were attributed to the storm, and another 44 took place just offshore. Throughout Thailand, approximately 47,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, and over 200,000 people were affected, of which about 153,000 were left homeless. Monetary losses reached 11 billion baht (US$456.5 million), ranking Gay as one of the costliest disasters in the country's history.

Within a week of the storm's passage, the Government of Thailand began distributing relief goods to residents throughout the affected provinces. Despite the effort by the government, 2,500 people from Pa Thiew and <a href="Tha%20Sae%20District">Tha Sae</a> demonstrated for additional and more intensive aid on 9 November. These protests were soon dispersed. Following considerable criticism for downplaying the impact of the typhoon, <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Thailand">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Chatichai%20Choonhavan">Chatichai Choonhavan</a> delayed his visit to the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> to oversee relief efforts. By 15 November the United States pledged to donate US$25,000 for recovery operations. Telephone connection was restored from Bangkok to <a href="Prachuap%20Khiri%20Khan">Prachuap Khiri Khan</a> by this time; however, areas further south remained disconnected. Generators were brought in to keep hospitals and government offices running since much of Chumphon Province remained without electricity for more than two weeks. As the scale of damage became more apparent, a request for international aid was made by 17 November to the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. Upon the announcement of the request, six countries pledged to provide nearly US$510,000 in funds collectively. Agriculture across Surat Thani Province was severely affected by the typhoon in the long-term as well. In the four years following Typhoon Gay, land use for orchards, rubber, and oil palm plantations decreased from 33.32 percent to 30.53 percent. Additionally, rice paddy coverage decreased from 22.96 percent to 13.03 percent.

Following post-storm surveys, it was determined that most of the severely damaged schools were built improperly and the upper-floors were not designed to bear typhoon-force winds. According to building codes in Thailand, structures are mandated to be able to withstand up to 120 kgf/m of pressure from winds. In the years following the typhoon, studies by engineers were conducted in the hardest hit regions to determine how to best rebuild structures in the country. With many of the destroyed structures being constructed from wood, reinforced concrete structures were the suggested replacement. The new buildings could last up to 50 years with proper construction; however, sub-standard building would result in a need for repairs within five years.

After crossing the Malay Peninsula, Typhoon Gay moved through the <a href="Andaman%20Islands">Andaman Islands</a> on November 6. As a precautionary measure, all air and sea traffic were suspended to the region. Winds in excess of 120 km/h (75 mph) battered <a href="North%20Andaman%20Island">North Andaman Island</a>, causing two structures to collapse. A few days before Typhoon Gay made landfall, officials in <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a> began evacuating roughly 50,000 residents along the coast and stockpiled relief goods. Some people were forced to leave vulnerable locations in the <a href="Visakhapatnam%20district">Visakhapatnam</a> and <a href="Srikakulam%20district">Srikakulam district</a>s. Local meteorologists warned that the storm was comparable to a <a href="1977%20Andhra%20Pradesh%20cyclone">cyclone in 1977</a> that killed more than 10,000 people. Striking the southern coast of Andhra Pradesh, Typhoon Gay produced wind gusts estimated at 320 km/h (200 mph). Along the coast, a <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> of inundated areas up to inland, washing away numerous structures. About outside of <a href="Kavali">Kavali</a>, a tall, <a href="Radio%20masts%20and%20towers%23Steel%20lattice">steel lattice</a> <a href="Microwave%20transmission">microwave tower</a> collapsed after experiencing winds estimated at 142 km/h (88 mph). Transportation and communication across the region was disrupted and 20,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving at least 100,000 people homeless. Nearly every structure in Annagaripalem were severely damaged or destroyed. Offshore, 25 fishermen drowned near <a href="Machilipatnam">Machilipatnam</a> after ignoring warnings to return to port. Throughout Andhra Pradesh, 69 fatalities and () worth of damage was attributed to Typhoon Gay. In the months after the storm, concrete shelters were built to house displaced persons.

In the summer of 2010, the NCAA ruled that Amaker had committed a recruiting violation, resulting in NCAA-mandated recruiting restrictions, the university's first NCAA penalty of the men's basketball program. The <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Harvard%20Crimson%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2010–11 team</a> became the first Harvard men's basketball team to clinch a share of the Ivy League championship and surpassed the prior season win total (23). The <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Harvard%20Crimson%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2011–12 team</a> became the first in school history to appear in the <a href="AP%20Poll">Associated Press</a> (AP) and <a href="Coaches%20Poll">Coaches Poll</a>s and, for the third year in a row, established a new school record for wins (26). Amaker's 2011–12, <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Harvard%20Crimson%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2012–13</a>, <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Harvard%20Crimson%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2013–14</a> and <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Harvard%20Crimson%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2014–15 teams</a> repeated as Ivy League champions. The 2012–13 team gave Harvard its first NCAA tournament victory. The 2013–14 team posted a record 27 wins. Amaker became the winningest coach in school history in 2016.

Amaker was born in <a href="Falls%20Church%2C%20Virginia">Falls Church</a>, Virginia, in 1965. He was raised by a single mother, Alma Amaker, a high school English teacher. Although not a part of Amaker's young life, his father attended some of Amaker's high school basketball games.

Amaker resided in Falls Church, but he attended <a href="Wilbert%20Tucker%20Woodson%20High%20School">W.T. Woodson High School</a> in <a href="Fairfax%2C%20Virginia">Fairfax</a>, Virginia, because his mother was a teacher in <a href="Fairfax%20County%20Public%20Schools">Fairfax County</a>. Her job allowed her to choose among the county schools, her choice made because the school's basketball coach, Red Jenkins, who called Amaker "T-bird," had been impressed with his performances at his youth summer league since Amaker was 10 years old. He began playing varsity for Woodson by December, making him the first freshman to play varsity in the school's history. His mother, whom Jenkins called "his first coach and his best coach," attended his practices and graded papers in the coach's office.

Duke University basketball head coach <a href="Mike%20Krzyzewski">Mike Krzyzewski</a>, who had just completed his <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">first season</a> as Duke coach, was in town to evaluate <a href="Johnny%20Dawkins">Johnny Dawkins</a> in a 1981 Washington D.C. summer league game, but was convinced to stay for a second game to see Amaker play. Krzyzewski met Amaker's mother and said, "Mrs. Amaker, your son is going to look great in Duke blue." At the time, Amaker had wanted to play for the <a href="Maryland%20Terrapins%20men%27s%20basketball">Maryland Terrapins</a> because his sister Tami went to the <a href="University%20of%20Maryland%2C%20College%20Park">University of Maryland, College Park</a> and Amaker idolized <a href="Maryland%20Terrapins%20men%27s%20basketball">Maryland</a> star guard <a href="John%20Lucas%20II">John Lucas</a>. He was recruited eventually to Duke by assistant coach <a href="Chuck%20Swenson">Chuck Swenson</a>, who would later become an assistant coach during Amaker's first five seasons at Michigan from 2001 to 2006.

Amaker played on the 1983 <a href="McDonald%27s%20All-American%20Team">McDonald's All-American Team</a> and was also named to the <a href="Parade%20All-American">Parade All-American</a> team. According to the "Fairfax Connection", the county changed the rules regarding where teachers could send their children due to Amaker's success at Woodson.

Amaker was a star point guard at Duke after becoming a freshman <a href="starting%20lineup">starter</a> for head coach Krzyzewski. He led the team in assists three years and in steals four seasons. While at Duke his roommate for away games was <a href="Mike%20Brey">Mike Brey</a>.

Dawkins played point guard for the <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1982–83 Blue Devils</a>, but moved to <a href="shooting%20guard">shooting guard</a> the following year to make way for Amaker. When Amaker joined the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1983–84 Blue Devils</a>, unranked Duke, led by Dawkins and Amaker, won its first seven games, the longest winning streak of fourth-year head coach Krzyzewski's career. Amaker had a <a href="field%20goal%20percentage">field goal accuracy</a> of over 65 percent in those games. He led Duke to the NCAA Tournament during his <a href="1984%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1984</a> freshman and <a href="1985%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1985</a> sophomore seasons, but neither team advanced to the Sweet Sixteen (regional semifinals). In the quarterfinal round of the <a href="1984%20ACC%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">1984 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament</a> against the <a href="Mark%20Price">Mark Price</a>-led <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets</a>, Amaker hit the game-winning shot with the score tied and less than 10 seconds left in <a href="overtime%20%28sports%29">overtime</a>. In some instances, Amaker's defense changed the game by limiting dribble penetration and forcing low shooting percentages regardless of whether he had notable offensive contributions.

During Amaker's <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">junior year (1985–86)</a>, Duke won the inaugural <a href="NIT%20Season%20Tip-Off">NIT Season Tip-Off</a> (then known as the preseason National Invitation Tournament) and Amaker had nine assists in the championship game against a <a href="Danny%20Manning">Danny Manning</a>-led <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Kansas%20Jayhawks%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Kansas</a> team. In the March <a href="Carolina%E2%80%93Duke%20rivalry">Carolina–Duke rivalry</a> game against <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">North Carolina</a> Amaker stole the ball from <a href="Jeff%20Lebo">Jeff Lebo</a> and made a <a href="layup">layup</a> that gave Duke a late first half three-point lead it never surrendered. The win clinched Duke's first regular season ACC Championship since 1966. According to <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> college basketball <a href="color%20commentator">color commentator</a> <a href="Dick%20Vitale">Dick Vitale</a>, Amaker had a reputation for putting pressure on the ball. That year, he helped the team win the <a href="1986%20ACC%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">1986 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament</a>, including a championship game victory over the Price-led <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Georgia Tech</a>.

Duke entered the <a href="1986%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1986 NCAA Tournament</a> ranked number one with a team that was built around the defensive efforts of its guards, Dawkins and Amaker. In the <a href="final%20four">final four</a> with Duke clinging to a 69–67 lead in a rematch against Kansas, Amaker pulled down the final rebound and sank two clinching free throws in the final five seconds. The win sent Duke to the championship game, giving the team its 21st consecutive victory and an NCAA record 37 single-season victories. "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" journalist Robert Markus described Amaker and Dawkins as the best guard combination in the country, although Vitale described Amaker as unknown.

The 1985–86 Blue Devils finished as national runner-up in the 1986 NCAA Tournament to <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Louisville%20Cardinals%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Louisville</a>. That year, Amaker recorded 81 steals, second to <a href="Jim%20Spanarkel">Jim Spanarkel</a> at that point in Duke history. He set the career steals record, which stood until <a href="Shane%20Battier">Shane Battier</a> broke it in 2001. Amaker also holds the Duke single-year NCAA Tournament record with 18 steals in 1986, which had been a tournament record. That year, he had seven steals in two tournament games—against <a href="Old%20Dominion%20Monarchs%20basketball">Old Dominion</a> in the second round on March 15 and Louisville in the final on March 31. This seven-steal total stood as the single-game NCAA tournament record for seven years until the <a href="1993%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1993 NCAA Tournament</a> when Darrell Hawkins had eight for <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Arkansas%20Razorbacks%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Arkansas</a> against and <a href="Grant%20Hill">Grant Hill</a> had eight for <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Duke</a> against . The seven steals was a championship game record that was tied by <a href="Mookie%20Blaylock">Mookie Blaylock</a> in the <a href="1988%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1988 NCAA Tournament</a> for <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Oklahoma%20Sooners%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Oklahoma</a> against <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Kansas%20Jayhawks%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Kansas</a> and was surpassed by <a href="Ty%20Lawson">Ty Lawson</a> in the <a href="2009%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">2009 NCAA Tournament</a> for <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">North Carolina</a> against <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Michigan%20State%20Spartans%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Michigan State</a>. Amaker was selected to the 1986 Division I Basketball Tournament All-NCAA Final Four Team. The 1986 Duke team graduated four of its five starters (Dawkins, <a href="Mark%20Alarie">Mark Alarie</a>, <a href="Jay%20Bilas">Jay Bilas</a> and <a href="David%20Henderson%20%28basketball%29">David Henderson</a>), leaving Amaker with an inexperienced supporting cast for his senior season. That year, Amaker was a spokesman against drug and alcohol abuse as part of an NCAA-Fiesta Bowl drug education television program.

<a href="Muggsy%20Bogues">Muggsy Bogues</a>, Amaker's ACC rival, was his roommate during the July <a href="1986%20FIBA%20World%20Championship">1986 FIBA World Championship</a>. He played in at least two games in the tournament, the first for a mere two minutes against <a href="Puerto%20Rico%20men%27s%20national%20basketball%20team">Puerto Rico</a>, but he played a prominent role in the USA's win over <a href="Italy%20national%20basketball%20team">Italy</a>. Amaker won a gold medal while serving on the <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20basketball%20team">US national team</a> in the FIBA World Championship, which served as the basketball tournament for the <a href="1986%20Goodwill%20Games">1986 Goodwill Games</a>.

Senior Amaker served as team <a href="captain%20%28sports%29">captain</a> for the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1986–87 Blue Devils</a>, and he led Duke back to the <a href="1987%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1987 NCAA tournament</a>, where they advanced to the Sweet Sixteen before losing to eventual champion <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Indiana</a>. The key players on the team that year were Amaker and sophomore <a href="Danny%20Ferry">Danny Ferry</a>. During his senior season, the <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> instituted the <a href="three-point%20field%20goal">three-point field goal</a>. Amaker led Duke in three point shooting that year. He hit a three-point shot with 1:39 remaining in overtime against 17–0 (4–0 ACC) <a href="Horace%20Grant">Horace Grant</a>-led <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Clemson%20Tigers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Clemson</a> to give Duke the lead for good. A few weeks later, with the score tied in regulation at 60 against and on a two-on-one <a href="fast%20break">fast break</a> with 16 seconds left, Amaker took a <a href="Jump%20shot%20%28basketball%29">jump shot</a>. Krzyzewski said Duke lost the game because it did not play as smart as its opponent and Markus described this example in his column. In Amaker's final home game, he made a jump shot with 1:15 remaining that put number seventeen Duke, which made all six of its free throws in the final 45 seconds, ahead for good in its rematch against number thirteen Clemson. In the 1987 tournament he led Duke in scoring in its final two games, including 23 against the <a href="Rick%20Calloway">Rick Calloway</a>/<a href="Keith%20Smart">Keith Smart</a>/<a href="Steve%20Alford">Steve Alford</a>-led Indiana, who was coached by <a href="Bobby%20Knight">Bobby Knight</a>, Krzyzewski's college coach.

That year, the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Basketball%20Coaches">National Association of Basketball Coaches</a> (NABC) awarded Amaker with the first <a href="Henry%20Iba%20Corinthian%20Award">Henry Iba Corinthian Award</a> (also known as the NABC Defensive Player of the Year). Amaker was selected to the <a href="1987%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20All-Americans">1987 NCAA Men's Basketball All-American</a> third team by the NABC. He was named to the 1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament All-Midwest Regional Team. He was a 1987 All-ACC 2nd-team honoree and earned the team co-<a href="MVP">MVP</a> award with Ferry that year. Amaker earned a <a href="bachelor%27s%20degree">bachelor's degree</a> in <a href="economics">economics</a> in 1987 from Duke.

Amaker set many Duke career and single-season assists records. He held the record for single-season assists in the years between 1986 and 1990, which was broken by <a href="Bobby%20Hurley">Bobby Hurley</a>. Hurley also broke Amaker's records in career assists per game (5.1, 1987–93) and career assists (708, 1987–92). <a href="Steve%20Wojciechowski">Steve Wojciechowski</a> broke Amaker's records in single-season assists to turnover ratio (2.88, 1985–97) and career assists to turnover ratio (2.11, 1987–98). Although his single-season assists records were surpassed by Hurley's freshman, sophomore and senior season totals, it still remains a record for a Duke junior. He also held Duke's career NCAA tournament assist average record with 57 in 12 games for a 4.7 average until Hurley surpassed it with 145 in 20 games for a 7.3 average. His school single-game assists record of 14 that he tied (Kevin Billerman, March 2, 1974, vs. <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">North Carolina</a>) vs. on February 19, 1986, was not broken until Hurley's senior 1993 season and is still a record for a junior.

Amaker holds several Duke and ACC records for games played. Amaker, Alarie and Dawkins have all started 40 games for the 1985–86 Duke team and both Ferry and <a href="Billy%20King%20%28basketball%29">Billy King</a> have played 40 games in a season. Amaker's 138 consecutive games started surpassed Alarie and Dawkins' totals of 133. His 138 consecutive games played was a Duke record until <a href="Chris%20Duhon">Chris Duhon</a> played 144 in a row ending in 2004. Consecutive games started is not shown in the 2009–10 Atlantic Coast Conference Media Guide records section. However, no ACC player has ever played more than 40 games in a season.

Following his <a href="college%20basketball">college basketball</a> career, Amaker was drafted by the <a href="Seattle%20SuperSonics">Seattle SuperSonics</a> in the 3rd round of the <a href="1987%20NBA%20Draft">1987 NBA Draft</a> with the 55th pick overall. He was also drafted in the first round of the April 1987 <a href="United%20States%20Basketball%20League">United States Basketball League</a>'s draft by the <a href="Staten%20Island%20Stallions">Staten Island Stallions</a>. He was regarded to be too small to play in the NBA at and . He was cut from the SuperSonics team on October 21, 1987. Subsequently, he spent three days with the <a href="Wyoming%20Wildcatters">Wyoming Wildcatters</a> of the <a href="Continental%20Basketball%20Association">Continental Basketball Association</a> in <a href="Casper%2C%20Wyoming">Casper</a>, Wyoming. He quickly decided he wanted to return to Duke to pursue a <a href="Master%20of%20Business%20Administration">Master of Business Administration</a> (MBA).

Amaker accepted a graduate assistant position on Krzyzewski's staff at Duke in 1988 while pursuing his MBA degree from the <a href="Fuqua%20School%20of%20Business">Fuqua School of Business</a>; the team reached the <a href="Final%20Four">Final Four</a> of the <a href="1989%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1989 NCAA Tournament</a>. He was an assistant coach from 1989 through 1997, during which Duke won two <a href="NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Championship">NCAA Championships</a> (<a href="1991%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1991</a> and <a href="1992%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1992</a>) and made two other Final Four appearances (<a href="1990%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1990</a> and <a href="1994%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1994</a>). By 1992, Duke had been to five consecutive final fours. While an assistant coach, he declined numerous <a href="Division%20I%20%28NCAA%29">Division I</a> head coaching opportunities. Duke also won four regular season <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a> men's basketball championships (<a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1991</a>, <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1992</a>, <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1994</a> and <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1997</a>) and the <a href="1992%20ACC%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">1992 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament</a>. The 1994–95 season was turbulent. In October 1994, Krzyzewski underwent back surgery. He attempted to return to coaching two weeks later but eventually was re-admitted to <a href="Duke%20University%20Hospital">Duke University Hospital</a> for four days in January due to related complications. He eventually relinquished control of the team for the season to interim coach <a href="Pete%20Gaudet">Pete Gaudet</a>.

After <a href="Wimp%20Sanderson">Wimp Sanderson</a> was forced out as coach of <a href="Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20men%27s%20basketball">Alabama</a> in 1992, Amaker was under consideration to replace him. In 1993, he was the leading candidate to assume the head coaching job at <a href="Northwestern%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball">Northwestern</a> when <a href="Bill%20Foster%20%28basketball%2C%20born%201930%29">Bill Foster</a> stepped aside to serve as interim <a href="athletic%20director">athletic director</a>, but at age 27, he declined the job when it was offered, noting that he had only been married one year and saying "It boiled down to us looking at a situation where we were extremely flattered, but a situation that wasn't right for us now." That summer Amaker was one of two college basketball members of the 10-man selection committee for the United States Olympic Team. In 1994, he was on the short list to replace <a href="Kevin%20O%27Neill%20%28basketball%29">Kevin O'Neill</a>, who left <a href="Marquette%20Golden%20Eagles%20men%27s%20basketball">Marquette</a> for a job at <a href="Tennessee%20Volunteers%20basketball">Tennessee</a>. In 1995, <a href="USC%20Trojans%20men%27s%20basketball">USC</a> was in negotiations to hire Amaker to replace interim coach <a href="Charlie%20Parker%20%28basketball%20coach%29">Charlie Parker</a>, who replaced <a href="George%20Raveling">George Raveling</a> following a car accident. The reason his negotiations with USC failed was compensation since Amaker was both a Duke assistant coach and earned an additional $100,000 (US$ in dollars) through a summer youth day camp. That summer, Duke promoted Amaker from assistant basketball coach to associate head coach. Krzyzewski returned to coaching in October 1995. USC went on to hire Parker, who did not last a full season as head coach. In 1996, Amaker was rumored to be on the short list to replace interim coach <a href="Steve%20Lavin">Steve Lavin</a> at <a href="UCLA%20Bruins%20men%27s%20basketball">UCLA</a> in 1997. When the Northwestern job opened up again in 1997, he was not under consideration because <a href="athletic%20director">athletic director</a> Rick Taylor sought a candidate with <a href="Division%20I%20%28NCAA%29">Division I</a> head coaching postseason experience.

In 1997, Amaker took the head coaching position at Seton Hall, who had missed the post season in the two prior years. At 31, Amaker became the youngest head basketball coach in <a href="Big%20East%20Conference">Big East Conference</a> history. Then, he took Seton Hall to the NCAA tournament once (2000) – when his team reached the "Sweet Sixteen" – and to the <a href="National%20Invitation%20Tournament">National Invitation Tournament</a> three times (1998, 1999 and 2001).

The earned the sixth seed in the <a href="1998%20Big%20East%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">1998 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament</a>, but were ousted in the first round by eleventh-seeded in overtime in the first round. They ended up in the <a href="1998%20National%20Invitation%20Tournament">1998 National Invitation Tournament</a> where they lost in the first round to to fall to a final record of 15–15. After returning Seton Hall to the post season, Amaker was considered for the Michigan job, but they decided to make interim coach <a href="Brian%20Ellerbe">Brian Ellerbe</a> a full-time head coach.

Seton Hall's earned the ninth seed in the <a href="1999%20Big%20East%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">1999 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament</a>. They defeated eighth-seeded in the first round, but lost by one point to top-seeded <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Connecticut%20Huskies%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Connecticut</a>, who went on to win the <a href="1999%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">national championship</a>. They were invited to the <a href="1999%20National%20Invitation%20Tournament">1999 National Invitation Tournament</a> where they lost in the first round to and again finished 15–15.

According to ESPN, Amaker recruited the #2 recruiting class in the nation for the class of 2000 while at Seton Hall.

The first round win gave the team 20 victories and no Big East team had achieved that number of victories without getting invited to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament in the 21-year history of the conference. They were invited to the <a href="2000%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">2000 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament</a> where they were seeded tenth in the East Region.

The following season, Amaker resigned as the Seton Hall head coach and became head coach at Michigan, replacing Ellerbe, who had been fired. Amaker met with Michigan athletic director Bill Martin in a hotel lobby instead of renting a room because Martin wanted to save money. Word of the meeting got back to ESPN and the <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> press was not kind to Amaker, hinting that he was devious and selfish.

Amaker inherited a <a href="Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team</a> that was five years into the investigation of the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20basketball%20scandal">University of Michigan basketball scandal</a>. The Wolverines opposed Amaker's former mentor Krzyzewski and the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2001–02 Duke Blue Devils</a> in his seventh game as head coach, but his team lost. Although the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2001–02 Wolverines</a> finished at 11–18, Amaker was able to lead the tenth-seeded team to a victory over seventh-seeded in the <a href="2002%20Big%20Ten%20Conference%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">2002 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament</a> before losing to two seed, .

Michigan finished the 2002–03 season with a 17–13 record, but sat out both that year's NCAA and NIT tournaments due to the self-imposed postseason ban. The team had banned itself from post season play before the season started. Nonetheless, over the course of the season the team had earned a three seed and a first round <a href="Bye%20%28sports%29">bye</a> in the <a href="2003%20Big%20Ten%20Conference%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">2003 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament</a>, but was upset in the second round by <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Indiana</a>. At the conclusion of the season, the NCAA added a second year of post season ineligibility to bring the severity of the punishment to a level it deemed more appropriate.

Amaker's <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2003–04 team</a> earned a fifth seed and first round bye in the <a href="2004%20Big%20Ten%20Conference%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">2004 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament</a> where it defeated fourth-seeded <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Iowa%20Hawkeyes%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Iowa</a> before losing to top-seeded <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Illinois%20Fighting%20Illini%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Illinois</a>.

The team won the championship game against , giving Amaker his highest single-season victory total up to that point in time with a 23–11 record. Amaker, who has tended to avoid the spotlight, was not on the court as his team celebrated the college basketball tradition of cutting of the nets in celebration of a championship at the 2004 NIT.

The <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2004–05 team</a> only achieved a nine seed in the <a href="2005%20Big%20Ten%20Conference%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">2005 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament</a> when it lost in the first round to eighth-seeded . It posted a 13–18 record (4–12 in conference) and finished ninth in the conference.

The Wolverines' <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2005–06 team</a> was a high percentage shooting, disciplined and balanced team. It was seeded seventh in the <a href="2006%20Big%20Ten%20Conference%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">2006 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament</a> but lost to the tenth seeded <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Minnesota%20Golden%20Gophers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Minnesota Golden Gophers</a>. The team had been ranked 37th in the <a href="Ratings%20Percentage%20Index">Ratings Percentage Index</a> prior to the game, making them a solid contender for an <a href="2006%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament</a> invitation. The loss sent them to the <a href="2006%20National%20Invitation%20Tournament">2006 National Invitation Tournament</a> where they were a number one seed, and they finished as the runner-up to . Along the way to its runner-up finish, the team defeated ninth-seeded , fifth-seeded (2OT), third-seeded and fifth-seeded . The team ended with a 22–11 (8–8) record.

Michigan's <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2006–07 team</a> earned an eight seed in the <a href="2007%20Big%20Ten%20Conference%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">2007 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament</a>, when it defeated the ninth-seeded <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Minnesota%20Golden%20Gophers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Minnesota Golden Gophers</a> before succumbing to top-seeded <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Ohio State</a>.

The team finished with a 22–13 record yet only 8–8 in conference play.

Amaker was credited for helping to restore the ethical reputation of a Michigan program which had been tarnished by scandal. However, he was criticized in the press for being unable to take the Wolverines to the NCAA tournament in six seasons at the helm. Some fans and sportswriters argued that Amaker's Michigan teams tended to underachieve and fall apart in pressure situations, particularly in conference, on the road and at the end of the regular season. On March 17, 2007, Amaker was fired by the University of Michigan. Amaker was paid $900,000 to buy out the remaining years on his contract.

On April 11, 2007, Amaker was named head men's basketball coach at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>. Harvard's recruiting process had included interviewing the underclassmen on the team who preferred Amaker to alternatives that included <a href="Mike%20Jarvis">Mike Jarvis</a> and <a href="Mike%20Gillian">Mike Gillian</a>. Upon his arrival, Harvard had endured five consecutive non-winning seasons, a streak that Amaker would not halt until his third year. Amaker became the only African American among the head coaches of Harvard's 32 athletic teams. Amaker's Harvard team beat his former team, <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Michigan</a>, in his eighth game as coach at Harvard during the 2007–08 season. It was the school's first win ever against a <a href="BCS%20conference">BCS conference</a> school.

"<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" published an accusatory article in March 2008, raising allegations of diminished academic standards among Amaker's first class of recruits and potentially improper recruiting practices. Prodded by this negative publicity, the <a href="Ivy%20League">Ivy League</a> office conducted a four-month investigation and "determined that no violations of NCAA or Ivy League rules occurred", clearing Amaker and his staff completely. Typically, the NCAA would accept the results of a formal investigation performed by a conference office but, in this case, the NCAA initially tabled and then eventually rejected the Ivy League's findings completely. The NCAA commenced its own investigation which ultimately took two years to complete.

Amaker's Harvard squad defeated then-<a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20men%27s%20basketball%20rankings">ranked</a> <a href="2008-09%20Boston%20College%20Eagles%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Boston College</a> (#17 <a href="AP%20Poll">AP Poll</a> – #24 <a href="Coaches%27%20Poll">Coaches' Poll</a>) on January 7, 2009 for the first win over a ranked team in the program's history. His 2008–09 recruiting class was the first time an Ivy League institution was ranked in the top 25 by ESPN.
The following season, the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Harvard%20Crimson%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2009–10 Harvard team</a> played competitively against #14 ranked <a href="2009-10%20Connecticut%20Huskies%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Connecticut</a> getting 30 points and 9 rebounds from senior <a href="Jeremy%20Lin">Jeremy Lin</a> on December 6. Although they held the lead only once, they were within 4 points in the final seconds of the game. They also won their December 9 rematch with by a 74–67 margin. After coaching Harvard to its highest single-season win total ever behind the play of Lin, Harvard was invited to participate in the <a href="2010%20CollegeInsider.com%20Tournament">2010 CollegeInsider.com Tournament</a>. The team was defeated in the first round by . During the season, Amaker was a nominee for the first <a href="Ben%20Jobe%20Award">Ben Jobe Award</a> as the top minority Division I college basketball coach, and was recognized by <a href="Fox%20Sports%20%28USA%29">Fox Sports</a> as the 2010 Ivy League Coach of the Year. Amaker was mentioned for the 2010 head coach opening at <a href="St.%20John%27s%20Red%20Storm%20men%27s%20basketball">St. John's</a>.

In the summer of 2010, the NCAA informed Harvard that Amaker's behavior constituted impermissible recruiting behavior. Harvard and the NCAA negotiated a settlement in which the university would "declare" what the NCAA consented to classify as secondary violations. Under the terms of the agreement, Harvard accepted punitive recruiting restrictions for the 2010–11 season. These were the first NCAA penalties ever assessed against the Harvard men's basketball program and the first instance of the Ivy League being overruled on a formal rules interpretation.

Under Amaker's leadership, the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Harvard%20Crimson%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2010–11 team</a> tied with <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Princeton%20Tigers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Princeton</a> for the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Ivy%20League%20men%27s%20basketball%20season">2010–11 Ivy League men's basketball season</a> championship, which was the school's first men's basketball Ivy League championship since the league was formed in the <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20NCAA%20University%20Division%20men%27s%20basketball%20season">1956–57 season</a>. Harvard finished the season a perfect 14–0 at home, which surpassed the prior season's school record of 11 home wins. Harvard's 12 conference game wins established a school record. The team's victory over <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Colorado%20Buffaloes%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Colorado</a> was the Crimson's first against a <a href="Big%2012%20Conference">Big 12 Conference</a> opponent since that conference commenced play in 1996. His fourth season also marked the fourth straight season that Harvard defeated at least one power conference opponent. Although Harvard never appeared in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20men%27s%20basketball%20rankings">2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings</a>, for a few weeks during the season they received a vote in the <a href="AP%20Poll">AP Poll</a>. On March 7, Harvard received a vote in both the AP Poll and the <a href="Coaches%27%20Poll">Coaches' Poll</a>. Harvard faced Ivy League co-champion Princeton in a <a href="one-game%20playoff">one-game playoff</a> and lost by a 63–62 margin. Princeton earned the <a href="2011%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament</a> automatic bid, while Harvard earned an at-large bid to the <a href="2011%20National%20Invitation%20Tournament">2011 National Invitation Tournament</a>, marking the school's first appearance in the National Invitation Tournament. On March 15, Harvard was defeated by by a 71–54 margin in the first round. The final record of 23–7 established a school record for number of wins, surpassing the prior season's total of 21. Amaker was again a finalist for the Ben Jobe Award, was a finalist for the <a href="Hugh%20Durham%20Award">Hugh Durham Award</a> and was selected by the NABC as the District 13 Coach of the Year. He was named Ivy League coach of the year by <a href="Collegeinsider.com">Collegeinsider.com</a>.

The <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Harvard%20Crimson%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2011–12 Harvard team</a> defeated then-<a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20men%27s%20basketball%20rankings">ranked</a> <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Florida State</a> (#22 AP Poll – #20 Coaches' Poll) on November 25, 2011 for the school's second win over a ranked team in the program's history, and the highest ranked opponent in the Coaches' Poll that Harvard had defeated up to that point. On December 5, 2011, Harvard made its first appearance in either the AP Poll (25) or Coaches' Poll (24). It left <a href="Brown%20Bears%20men%27s%20basketball">Brown</a> as the only remaining Ivy League school to have never been ranked in the AP Poll and leaves only seven schools that have played Division I basketball since the AP Poll began that have never been ranked in it. Harvard was the first Ivy League team ranked in the Coaches' Poll since the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Cornell%20Big%20Red%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2009–10 Cornell Big Red</a> and the first Ivy League team ranked in the AP Poll since the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Princeton%20Tigers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1997–98 Princeton Tigers</a>, who finished 8th in the poll. By January 2, the team achieved rankings of 22 in the AP Poll and 21 in the Coaches' Poll. The team was also ranked 21st in the Coaches' Poll on February 6. The team established a new record for single-season wins as well as single-season non-league wins and tied the record for conference game wins.

Casey and Curry had been first-team and second-team All-Ivy selections for the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Ivy%20League%20men%27s%20basketball%20season">2011–12 Ivy League men's basketball season</a>, respectively.

Ruffed lemur

The ruffed lemurs of the <a href="genus">genus</a> Varecia are <a href="Strepsirrhini">strepsirrhine</a> <a href="primate">primate</a>s and the largest <a href="Extant%20taxon">extant</a> <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s within the family <a href="Lemuridae">Lemuridae</a>. Like all living lemurs, they are found only on the island of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. Formerly considered to be a <a href="monotypic">monotypic</a> genus, two <a href="species">species</a> are now recognized: the <a href="black-and-white%20ruffed%20lemur">black-and-white ruffed lemur</a>, with its three <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, and the <a href="red%20ruffed%20lemur">red ruffed lemur</a>.

Ruffed lemurs are <a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a> and <a href="arboreal">arboreal</a> <a href="quadruped">quadruped</a>s, often observed leaping through the upper <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> of the seasonal <a href="tropical%20rainforest">tropical rainforest</a>s in eastern Madagascar. They are also the most <a href="frugivore">frugivorous</a> of the Malagasy lemurs, and they are very sensitive to habitat disturbance. Ruffed lemurs live in multi-male/multi-female groups and have a complex and flexible social structure, described as <a href="fission-fusion%20society">fission-fusion</a>. They are highly vocal and have loud, raucous calls.

Ruffed lemurs are <a href="seasonal%20breeder">seasonal breeder</a>s and highly unusual in their reproductive strategy. They are considered an "evolutionary enigma" in that they are the largest of the extant species in Lemuridae, yet exhibit reproductive traits more common in small, nocturnal lemurs, such as short <a href="gestation">gestation</a> periods (~102 days) and relatively large average <a href="litter%20%28animal%29">litter</a> sizes (~2–3). Ruffed lemurs also build nests for their newborns (the only primates that do so), carry them by mouth, and exhibit an absentee parental system by stashing them while they forage. Infants are <a href="altricial">altricial</a>, although they develop relatively quickly, traveling independently in the wild after 70 days and attaining full adult size by six months.

Threatened by habitat loss and hunting, ruffed lemurs are facing <a href="extinction">extinction</a> in the wild. However, they reproduce readily in captivity and have been gradually <a href="reintroduction">re-introduced</a> into the wild since 1997. Organizations that are involved in ruffed lemur conservation include the <a href="Durrell%20Wildlife%20Conservation%20Trust">Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust</a>, the <a href="Lemur%20Conservation%20Foundation">Lemur Conservation Foundation (LCF)</a>, the <a href="Madagascar%20Fauna%20Group">Madagascar Fauna Group (MFG)</a>, <a href="Monkeyland%20Primate%20Sanctuary">Monkeyland Primate Sanctuary</a> in South Africa, <a href="Wildlife%20Trust%20%28US%29">Wildlife Trust</a>, and the <a href="Duke%20Lemur%20Center">Duke Lemur Center (DLC)</a>.

<a href="Lemur">Lemur</a>s are not known in the <a href="fossil%20record">fossil record</a> on Madagascar until the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> and <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> epochs. Consequently, little is known about the evolution of ruffed lemurs, let alone the entire lemur <a href="clade">clade</a>, which comprises the <a href="endemic">endemic</a> primate population of the island.

Although there is still much debate about the origins of <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s on Madagascar, it is generally accepted that a single <a href="rafting%20event">rafting event</a>, similar to the one that brought <a href="Platyrrhini">New World monkeys</a> to <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, occurred around 50–80 million years ago and allowed ancestral lemurs to cross the <a href="Mozambique%20Channel">Mozambique Channel</a> and colonize the island, which had already split from Africa (while it was joined to the Indian subcontinent), approximately 160 million years ago. The resulting <a href="founder%20effect">founder effect</a> and either non-existent or inferior competition resulted in <a href="speciation">speciation</a> as the lemur ancestors radiated out to fill open or insufficiently guarded <a href="ecological%20niche">niches</a>. Today, the endemic primate <a href="fauna">fauna</a> of Madagascar contains over three-quarters of the <a href="Extant%20taxon">extant</a> species of the suborder <a href="Strepsirrhini">Strepsirrhini</a>, which had been abundant throughout <a href="Laurasia">Laurasia</a> and Africa during the <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a> and <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> <a href="epoch%20%28geology%29">epochs</a>.

The ruffed lemur genus, "Varecia", is a member of the <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Lemuridae">Lemuridae</a>. The extinct genus, "<a href="Pachylemur">Pachylemur</a>" most closely resembled the ruffed lemurs but died out after the arrival of humans. The genus "Varecia" contains two species, <a href="red%20ruffed%20lemur">red ruffed lemur</a>s and <a href="black-and-white%20ruffed%20lemur">black-and-white ruffed lemur</a>s, the latter having three subspecies.


Ruffed lemurs, along with several species of <a href="true%20lemur">brown lemur</a> were once included in the genus "<a href="Ring-tailed%20lemur">Lemur</a>". In 1962, the ruffed lemurs were reassigned to the genus "Varecia".

The red ruffed lemur and the black-and-white ruffed lemur were formerly recognized as subspecies, "Varecia variegata rubra" and "Varecia variegata variegata" respectively. In 2001 both were elevated to species status, a decision that was later supported by genetic research. Three subspecies of black-and-white ruffed lemur, which had been published decades earlier, were also recognized as "variegata", "editorum", and "subcincta", although studies have not been entirely conclusive.

<a href="Subfossil">Subfossil</a> remains of two <a href="Subfossil%20lemur">extinct lemur species</a> were previously classified under the genus "Varecia". Found at sites in central and southwestern Madagascar, "Varecia insignis" and "V. jullyi" were very similar to modern ruffed lemurs, but more robust and assumed to be more <a href="Terrestrial%20animal">terrestrial</a>, and thus more prone to predation by early human settlers. More recent studies have shown that these extinct species had a diet similar to that of modern ruffed lemurs and that they were also arboreal in nature. Enough differences were demonstrated to merit a separate genus, "<a href="Pachylemur">Pachylemur</a>". These close relatives of ruffed lemurs are now named "Pachylemur insignis" and "P. jullyi".

Ruffed lemurs are the largest extant members of the family Lemuridae, with an average head-body length between and a total length from , while ranging in weight from . The thick, furry tail is longer than the body, averaging in length and is used primarily for balance while moving through the trees. Ruffed lemurs exhibit neither <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> nor <a href="sexual%20dichromatism">sexual dichromatism</a>, and females have three pairs of <a href="mammary%20gland">mammary gland</a>s.
Ruffed lemurs are characterized by their long, <a href="Dog">canine-like</a> <a href="Snout">muzzle</a>, which includes a significant <a href="malocclusion">overbite</a>. The face is mostly black, with furry "ruffs" running from the ears to the neck. Depending on the species, these ruffs are either white ("V. variegata") or deep reddish ("V. rubra"). Likewise, the coloration of the fluffy fur also varies by species, while the coloration pattern varies by subspecies in the <a href="black-and-white%20ruffed%20lemur">black-and-white ruffed lemur</a>. There are also intermediates in color variation between the two species.

As with all lemurs, the ruffed lemur has special adaptations for <a href="personal%20grooming">grooming</a>, including a <a href="toilet-claw">toilet-claw</a> on its second toe, and a <a href="toothcomb">toothcomb</a>.

Ruffed lemurs are considered <a href="arboreal">arboreal</a> <a href="quadruped">quadruped</a>s, with the most common type of movement being above-branch quadrupedalism. While in the canopy leaping, vertical clinging, and <a href="suspensory%20behavior">suspensory behavior</a>, are also common, while bridging, bimanual movement, and bipedalism are infrequently seen. When moving from tree to tree, ruffed lemurs will look over the shoulder while clinging, launch themselves into the air, and twist mid-air so that their <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Dorsal%20and%20ventral">ventral surface</a> lands on the new tree or limb. Suspensory behavior is more common in ruffed lemurs than in other lemur species. When ruffed lemurs come down to the ground, they continue to move quadrupedally, running with bounding hops and the tail held high.

Being highly <a href="arboreal">arboreal</a> and the most <a href="frugivore">frugivorous</a> of the lemurs, they thrive only in <a href="primary%20forest">primary forest</a> with large fruiting trees, where they spend most of their time in the upper <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a>. By spending the majority of their time in the <a href="crown%20%28botany%29">crown</a> of tall forest trees, they are relatively safe from predators such as the <a href="Fossa%20%28animal%29">fossa</a>.

Ruffed lemurs are active primarily during the day (<a href="diurnality">diurnal</a>), during which time they feed primarily on fruits and <a href="nectar">nectar</a>, often adopting <a href="suspensory%20behavior">suspensory postures</a> while feeding. The seeds of the fruit they eat pass through their <a href="gastrointestinal%20tract">digestive tract</a> and are propagated throughout the rainforests in their <a href="feces">feces</a>, helping to ensure new plant growth and a healthy forest ecosystem. These lemurs are also significant <a href="pollinator">pollinator</a>s of the traveler's tree ("<a href="Ravenala%20madagascariensis">Ravenala madagascariensis</a>"). Without destroying the <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>, they lick the nectar from deep inside the flower using their long muzzles and tongues, collecting and transferring pollen on their snouts and fur from plant to plant. This relationship is thought to be a result of <a href="co-evolution">co-evolution</a>.

Like all lemurs, this genus is found only on the island of Madagascar off the southeastern coast of <a href="Africa">Africa</a>. Confined to the island's seasonal eastern <a href="tropical%20rainforest">tropical rainforest</a>s, it is uncommon to rare throughout its range, which historically ran from the <a href="Masoala%20National%20Park">Masoala Peninsula</a> in the northeast to the <a href="List%20of%20rivers%20of%20Madagascar">Mananara River</a> in the south. Today, the <a href="black-and-white%20ruffed%20lemur">black-and-white ruffed lemur</a> has a much larger range than the <a href="red%20ruffed%20lemur">red ruffed lemur</a>, although it is very patchy, extending from slightly northwest of <a href="Maroantsetra">Maroantsetra</a>, on <a href="Antongil%20Bay">Antongil Bay</a>, in the north down the coast to the Mananara River near <a href="Vangaindrano">Vangaindrano</a> in the south. Additionally, a concentrated population of black-and-white ruffed lemurs, of the subspecies "Varecia variegata subcincta", can also be found on the island reserve of <a href="Nosy%20Mangabe">Nosy Mangabe</a> in Antongil Bay. It is suspected that this population was introduced to the island in the 1930s. The red ruffed lemur, on the other hand, has a very restricted range on the Masoala Peninsula.

Historically, the <a href="confluence">confluence</a> of the <a href="List%20of%20rivers%20of%20Madagascar">Vohimara and Antainambalana Rivers</a> may have been a zone of <a href="Hybrid%20zone">hybridization</a> between these two species, although no conclusive results have indicated current interbreeding. In general, the Antainambalana River appears to <a href="reproductive%20isolation">isolate</a> the red ruffed lemurs from the neighboring subspecies of black-and-white ruffed lemur, "V. v. subcincta". The subspecies "V. v. variegata" can be found further south, and "V. v. editorum" is the southernmost subspecies. The ranges of these two southern subspecies overlap and <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">intermediate forms</a> are reported to exist, although this has not been confirmed.

The rainforests in which these animals live are seasonal, with two primary seasons: the hot, wet season (November through April), and the cool, dry season (May through October). The primary habitat for both species, at any season, is in the crowns of trees, where they spend the majority of their time above ground. With the seasonal availability of resources being similar regardless of location, there is little to no difference in tree usage between species. From September through April, more fruit is available, so females prefer the <a href="liana">liana</a>s in the crowns of trees. Both sexes prefer the lower, major branches during the hot, rainy season. The tree crowns are predominantly used from May through August when young leaves and flowers are in abundance.

The following lemur species can be found within the same geographic range as ruffed lemurs:


Ruffed lemurs either demonstrate feeding dominance or divide resources by using different forest strata. They are dominant over red-bellied lemurs, while eastern lesser bamboo lemurs avoid encountering them altogether. White-headed lemurs, on the other hand, prefer the <a href="understory">understory</a> and lower canopy, below , while the ruffed lemurs mainly keep to the upper canopy, above . Play has even been observed between infant ruffed lemurs and white-headed lemurs.

Ruffed lemurs, on average, spend 28% of the day feeding, 53% resting, and 19% traveling, although differences in resting and feeding durations have been observed between males and females, with females resting less and feeding more. They are diurnal; although peak activity occurs during the early morning and late afternoon or evening, resting usually occurs around midday. When resting, ruffed lemurs often sit hunched or upright. They are also frequently seen lying <a href="prone%20position">prone</a> over a branch or sunbathing in a <a href="supine%20position">supine position</a> with the limbs outstretched. When feeding, they will often hang upside-down by their hind feet, a type of <a href="suspensory%20behavior">suspensory behavior</a>, which allows them to reach fruits and flowers.

Being highly arboreal, they spend the majority of their time in the high canopy throughout the day. Ruffed lemurs spend the majority of their time between above the forest floor, followed by up, and are least frequently seen at . During the hot season, they will relocate to the lower canopy to help regulate their body temperature. In the cold season, ruffed lemurs are least active and may dedicate 2% of their resting time to sunbathing in order to warm up.

Long-term field research has shown that range size, group size, social systems, and territorial behavior vary widely, and may be greatly affected by food distribution and quality. It is generally agreed that the ruffed lemur social system is multi-male/multi-female with a <a href="fission-fusion%20society">fission-fusion society</a>, although some populations of black-and-white ruffed lemur have been reported as <a href="pair%20bonding">monogamous</a>. This social flexibility is suspected to improve survivability despite an inflexible feeding ecology.

Being the most <a href="frugivore">frugivorous</a> members of the family Lemuridae, consuming an average of 74–90% fruit, ruffed lemurs also consume nectar (4–21%), and supplement the rest of their diet with young leaves (3–6%), mature leaves (1%), flowers (3–6%), and some seeds. Ruffed lemurs have also been reported to come to the ground to eat <a href="fungus">fungi</a> and exhibit <a href="geophagy">geophagy</a>.

The majority of their diet is made up of relatively few common plant species, with a few species providing more than 50% of the diet. Fig species of the genus "<a href="Ficus">Ficus</a>", for example, account for 78% of the fruit consumed by red ruffed lemurs on the Masoala Peninsula. Although plant species and diets vary by location, the most common food plants reported from the field include the following:


Fruit trees do not appear to be selected by species but by availability and accessibility of edible fruit. And despite predominance of a few plant species in the ruffed lemur diet, the remainder of their diet consists of between 80 and 132 other species from 36 plant families.

The availability of food reflects the seasonal nature of the forests in which they live. During the hot season, fruit, flowers, and young leaves are more abundant, whereas the cold, wet season offers more young leaves and flowers. Despite this, the diet changes little between seasons, except that females will consume more high-protein, low-fiber items, such as young leaves and flowers, during pregnancy and lactation in order to offset the energy costs of reproduction. Nectar is only available sporadically, yet constitutes a major food source when the flowers bloom. The nectar of the traveler's palm ("<a href="Ravenala%20madagascariensis">Ravenala madagascariensis</a>") is a favorite among ruffed lemurs.

The social organization of ruffed lemurs is widely variable in both group organization and group composition, although no notable difference can be seen between the two species. Ruffed lemurs are typically described as <a href="multi-male%20group">multi-male group</a>s with a <a href="Fission-fusion%20society">fission-fusion</a> social structure, although this can vary by season and locality.

In a study done at Masoala Peninsula on red ruffed lemurs three levels of organization were identified and defined: communities, core groups, and subgroups. Communities are individuals that affiliated regularly with each other, but rarely with <a href="conspecificity">conspecifics</a> outside of the community. Although the entire multi-male/multi-female community lives within a discrete home range, all individuals are never seen in the same location at the same time. Instead, individuals form dispersed social networks, known as core groups, within the community. Core groups are individuals that shared the same core area within a community territory throughout the year. Core groups typically consist of two reproductive females, as well as reproductive males and subadults, ranging in size from two individuals to nine. Females within the groups are cooperative, but male encounters are often <a href="agonistic%20behavior">agonistic</a>. Subgroups, on the other hand, vary daily in size, composition, and duration, and consist of associated individuals from either the same core group or different core groups, depending on the season. It is from the consistent, daily changes in these subgroups that occur throughout the year, as well as the seasonal formations of core groups in core areas, that demonstrate the fission-fusion nature of ruffed lemur social structure.

In another study done at <a href="Nosy%20Mangabe">Nosy Mangabe</a> on black-and-white ruffed lemurs a fourth level or organization was defined: affiliates. Affiliates were individuals with more persistent social bonds and more frequent interactions, usually within a core group, but sometimes also between core groups within a subgroup. Adult females typically had many affiliates, whereas adult males rarely interacted with conspecifics, living a more solitary existence.

Past studies have reported other social organizations in ruffed lemurs including <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a> <a href="pair%20bonding">pair bonding</a>. This may have been due to the use of short-term, seasonal <a href="field%20study">field studies</a> instead of yearlong studies that take into consideration the effects that changing seasons have on ruffed lemur communities. For instance, during the cold, rainy season, which corresponds with the breeding season, interactions between core groups within a community are significantly reduced. During this time small subgroups form consisting of a mature female, a mature male, and sometimes offspring. This can be misinterpreted as monogamous pair bonding.

Ranging behavior can also exhibit seasonal variability. During the hot, wet season, females range widely, either alone or in groups of up to six individuals. In the cool, dry season, smaller core groups stabilize in order to occupy concentrated areas. Therefore, during seasons when fruit is abundant, subgroups are larger while scarcity is met with more solitary behavior. This suggests that although their feeding ecology is inflexible, being tied to widely distributed, patchy, and sometimes scarce fruit, ruffed lemurs instead adapt the social system in order to survive.

In terms of dominance, the ruffed lemur's social structure is not as clear-cut as other lemur societies where <a href="matriarchy">female dominance</a> is the norm. Although it is historically reported that "males were subordinate to females," especially with captive and free-ranging ruffed lemur populations demonstrating this, wild populations cannot be definitively labeled as <a href="matriarchy">matriarchal</a> due to inter-group variation.

There are also social differences between males and females. Females typically have many affiliates and bond strongly with other females both within and outside their core areas, but do not affiliate with individuals outside the community range, except during <a href="mating%20season">mating season</a>. Males, on the other hand, are more solitary, interact with only a couple of conspecifics, have weak social bonds with other males, and rarely associate with others outside their core group. Furthermore, field studies suggest that only females play a role in communal home range defense. Males may scent-mark and remain relatively silent, but otherwise show little involvement during disputes.

Community range or <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">territory</a> size can vary widely, from while group size can range from a single pair to 31 individuals. <a href="Population%20density">Population density</a> is also noticeably variable. These wide ranges can be attributed to differing levels of protection and degree of environmental degradation, with better protection and a less degraded environment resulting in higher population density and more moderately sized community ranges. (The duration and seasonality of the studies involved may also have contributed to low group size estimates and community ranges. A study at the <a href="Betampona%20Reserve">Betampona Reserve</a>, for instance, observed monogamous pairs with two to five infants maintaining ranges of .) Core areas at <a href="Ambatonikonilahy">Ambatonikonilahy</a> constituted approximately 10% of the overall community range and showed a close relationship with the location of the largest fruiting trees.

The average daily traveling distance for ruffed lemurs varies between , averaging per day. Activity patterns within the community range vary by gender and season. Males generally stay within a core area all year, whereas females only confine themselves to a core area during the cold wet season, then expand their range throughout the community range during the hot, rainy season. Females expand their traveling range slightly after giving birth, still staying within the core area, but gradually range further in December when they begin stashing their infants with other community members while they look for food. Females range the furthest later during the hot, rainy season. Both activity level and reproductive activity can be summarized in the following table.

Although males demonstrate little involvement in territorial disputes between neighboring communities, and ruffed lemur communities lack cohesiveness, females communally defend the community range against females of other communities. These disputes occur mostly during the hot, rainy season, when resources are more abundant and occur near the boundaries of community ranges. Spacing is maintained by <a href="territorial%20marking">scent marking</a> and vocal communication. Ruffed lemurs are known for their loud, raucous calls that are answered by neighboring communities and subgroups within the same community.

During agonistic encounters between communities, chasing, scent-marking, calling, and occasional physical contact can be seen. Other social behaviors appear to vary between wild and captive ruffed lemurs, as illustrated by the following table.

Some affiliative behaviors are seasonal or gender-specific, such as the male squeal approach and anogenital inspections performed during the mating season. Another example is the female greeting behavior, where two females will use their anogenital scent glands to mark each other's backs, jump over one another, writhe together, and emit squealing vocalizations. This behavior is not seen during the end of the cool, dry season or around gestation. The frequency of other affiliative behaviors can be affected by age. All ruffed lemurs over five months of age <a href="social%20grooming">allogroom</a>, and, in captivity, subadults participate in play more frequently than adults.

Historically, relatively few studies of <a href="learning">learning</a> and <a href="cognition">cognition</a> have been performed on strepsirrhine primates, including ruffed lemurs. However, a study at the <a href="Lemur%20Conservation%20Foundation%23Myakka%20City%20Lemur%20Reserve">Myakka City Lemur Reserve</a> demonstrated that ruffed lemurs, along with several other members of the family Lemuridae, could understand the outcome of simple arithmetic operations.

As with all strepsirrhine primates, <a href="olfactory%20communication">olfactory communication</a> is used extensively by ruffed lemurs – <a href="Territorial%20marking">scent marking</a> in territorial defense and disputes, as well as female greeting displays. The scents communicate the sex, location, and identity of their owner.

Females predominantly scent mark with their anogenital <a href="scent%20gland">scent gland</a>s, by squatting to rub their anogenital region along horizontal surfaces, such as tree limbs. Males, on the other hand, favor using the glands on their neck, muzzle, and chest, by embracing horizontal and vertical surfaces and rubbing themselves over them. Both sexes will occasionally scent mark in ways characteristic of the opposite sex.

In greeting displays, female ruffed lemurs will leap over one another, scent marking the other individual's back in the process.

Ruffed lemurs are highly vocal, with an extensive vocal repertoire with calls being used in multiple contexts. Calls can also vary seasonally. During the hot, rainy season, the loud, raucous calls that are a hallmark of ruffed lemurs allow groups to remain in contact and maintain spacing. These loud calls can be heard up to away.

Ruffed lemurs use <a href="alarm%20signal">alarm calls</a> that differentiate between ground and aerial predators. For instance an "abrupt roar" or "huff" alerts the group to an avian predator, and a "pulsed squawk" or "growl-snort" communicates the existence of a mammalian ground predator. When sounding these calls, such as the pulsed squawk, adults direct them at the predator after moving to a safe position. Once the alarm call is sounded by one individual, the resulting chorus can even reach the furthest ranging community members.

In captivity, ruffed lemur vocalizations have been studied and divided into three general groups: high-, medium-, and low-amplitude calls.

The well-known "roar/shriek chorus" is spontaneous, occurring most often during period of high activity, as well as being contagious, involving communal participation including infants three to four months old. "Abrupt roars" are also more common during high activity and aside from alerting group members to the presence of an avian predator, they probably also help maintain contact with individuals outside of visual range or indicate an aggressive/defensive response to a disturbance. In the wild, both of these calls are emitted more during the hot, rainy season due to heighten activity. All high-amplitude calls are delivered with from a "taut" body posture.

Medium-amplitude calls operate over a shorter range or often involve moderately arousing situations, such as frustration or submission. Low-amplitude calls also generally operate over a short range, yet also cover a wider range of aggravation levels.

Whines are highly variable between individual ruffed lemurs. "Cough", "grumble", "squeak", and "squeal" have only been observed and researched in the wild.

The calls of ruffed lemurs vary only slightly between the two species. In fact, in captivity, it has been documented that red ruffed lemurs understand and even join in the alarm calls of black-and-white ruffed lemurs. One minor difference between the vocal repertoires of these two species is in the pulse rate and frequency of the "pulsed squawk", which is much faster and higher in red ruffed lemurs than in black-and-white ruffed lemurs. The difference in this vocalization is only interspecific, showing no signs of significant sexual dimorphism within each species.

In black-and-white ruffed lemurs, "pulsed squawks" sometimes slow down as the group calms down, and integrate with the "wail", creating "pulsed squawk-wail intermediates" .

Contrary to initial reports of <a href="Animal%20sexual%20behaviour%23Monogamy">monogamy</a>, ruffed lemurs in the wild exhibit seasonal <a href="Animal%20sexual%20behaviour%23Polygamy">polygamous breeding behavior</a>, with both males and females mating with more than one partner within a single season. Mating is not restricted to just community members, but also involves members of neighboring communities. Females mate primarily with males with whom they had affiliative relations prior to the mating season, although some matings occurred with roaming males from other communities.

Shortly before mating season begins, females exhibit <a href="sexual%20swelling">swelling of the sex skin</a>, which reaches its peak around the middle of their 14.8 day <a href="estrous%20cycle">estrous cycle</a>. Male sexual physiology also undergoes its own change, with testicular volume increasing during mating season, peaking around the time of breeding. Aggression also increases during the mating season, both between members of the same sex and by females towards the male attempting to mate with her. Females have been observed grappling, cuffing, and biting the male during <a href="copulation%20%28zoology%29">copulation</a>. Either sex may approach the other when the female is in estrus. Initially they may "roar-shriek" with each other. When a male approaches a female he often lowers his head and squeals, inspecting the female's genitalia by licking or sniffing, scent-marking, and offering a submissive chattering vocalization. When a female approaches a male, she may posture herself for mounting. Mating pairs often copulate many times during the course of a mating bout.

The mating season lasts from May through July, during the cold, rainy season, resulting in birth and peak <a href="lactation">lactation</a> coinciding with the time that fruit is the most plentiful. The <a href="gestation">gestation</a> period of ruffed lemurs is the shortest of the family Lemuridae, averaging 102 days (with a range of 90 to 106 days). Gestation in the wild last slightly longer than in captivity, averaging 106 days. Just like the mating season, <a href="parturition">parturition</a> is also seasonal, synchronized to the end of the cold, dry season and the start of the productive hot, rainy season.

In addition to an abnormally short gestation period, ruffed lemurs share another feature with small, nocturnal lemurs by producing the largest <a href="litter%20%28animal%29">litters</a> of the family Lemuridae. Litters typically include two or three infants, although up to five have been reported. Birth weights in captivity average between and range from . Ruffed lemur infants are <a href="altricial">altricial</a>, and are born with their eyes open and a full coat of fur.

Ruffed lemurs are the only known primates to build arboreal nests, used exclusively for birth and for the first week or two of life. Starting three weeks prior to birth, females begin constructing the nest from twigs, branches, leaves, and vines, locating it within her core area and above ground. The nests have only one apparent entry point, and are shallow and dish-shaped. During the first couple of weeks, the mother is mostly solitary and does not travel far from the nest, spending as much as 70–90% of her time with the newborns (in captivity). In order to find food, she will leave the infants alone in the nest or, after the first couple of weeks, will carry them in her mouth and stash them in concealed locations in the canopy while she forages. Since this early developmental period corresponds with the end of the cold, dry season, which offers the least amount of fruit, energy is conserved for lactation while travel is limited. As the hot, rainy season begins, fruit availability rises, lactation demands rise as well, and females increase their travel distance in search of food.

Unlike other diurnal primates, which usually carry their infants with them, ruffed lemur mothers will stash their young by concealing them in the canopy foliage, leaving them to rest and sit quietly for several hours while she forages and performs other activities. Mothers continue to transport their offspring by mouth, moving them one at a time by grasping the infant's belly crosswise. This form of transport usually stops around 2.5 months of age when the infants become too heavy to carry.

Ruffed lemurs are <a href="Cooperative%20breeding">cooperative breeders</a>, with parental care being shared by all community members. For example, mothers will stash their offspring with other mothers or leave them to be guarded by other community members, including non-breeding individuals of both genders. While the mother is away, community members will not only care for and guard them, but also sound alarm calls if danger is detected or if leaving the infant alone. They will also respond to alarm calls by others. These coordinated vigilance displays further involve communal transmission of the alarm call, with nearby community members repeating the alarm call, potentially summoning the mother back to her offspring. Infant transport by other members of the community has also been recorded. Females have been observed nursing infants of their close relatives, while close kin have adopted rejected infants, acting as foster parents.

Male care for infants has been documented in ruffed lemur societies. During early development, adult males may guard the nests of multiple core group females, as well as help care for the infants that were likely fathered by other males. During the season when females practice infant stashing, males effectively lighten the reproductive burden of up to several mothers by guarding, huddling, grooming, travelling, playing with and feeding the young.

Female ruffed lemurs produce relatively rich milk compared to other lemurs, and consequently, their young develop faster than those of other lemurs. Infants develop rapidly, attaining approximately 70–75% adult weight by the age of four months. They begin climbing and clinging at one month of age, advancing to the point of independently following their mother and group members through the canopy at heights of by two to three months. Full adult mobility is attained at three to four months of age. Socially, they begin exchanging contact calls with their mother at three weeks, and select their mother as their play partner 75–80% of the time during the first three months. Participation in greeting displays and more extensive vocalizations commences around four months, while scent marking does not start until six months of age. Infants begin testing solid food starting around 40 days to two months with weaning occurring between four and six months in the wild, although some individuals have continued to nurse until seven to eight months.

Infant mortality is often high among ruffed lemurs, but can also be highly variable. In some seasons, as many as 65% are unable to reach three months of age, possibly due to falls and related injuries, although in some seasons infant mortality is as low as 0%. For those that do survive to adulthood, sexual maturity is attained at 18 to 20 months in females and 32 to 48 months in males. Sexual maturity may take longer to reach in the wild compared to captivity. For females, the inter-birth interval, or time between successive offspring, is typically one year, and in captivity, females can remain reproductively active until the age of 23. The life expectancy for both species of ruffed lemur is estimated at 36 years in captivity.

In a land where approximately 90% of the original island forest has been destroyed, ruffed lemurs cling to only a small fraction of their original range. Completely dependent upon large fruiting trees, neither species appears to be flexible with its habitat choice, with <a href="selection%20cutting">selective logging</a> resulting in significantly lower <a href="population%20density">population densities</a>. Although they can survive in very disturbed habitats with lower population densities, they are still especially vulnerable to habitat disturbance. Decreased genetic diversity, in tandem with hunting, natural disasters, predation, and disease, can easily wipe out small populations.

The <a href="black-and-white%20ruffed%20lemur">black-and-white ruffed lemur</a> was elevated by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">IUCN</a> to critically endangered (A2cd) status from endangered status in 2008. They cite that "the species is believed to have undergone a decline of 80% over a period of 27 years, due primarily to a decline in area and quality of habitat within the known range of the species and due to levels of exploitation." The total area of all known localities in which black-and-white ruffed lemurs exist is estimated at less than , while the total wild population is estimated between 1,000 and 10,000.

The <a href="red%20ruffed%20lemur">red ruffed lemur</a> was downgraded to endangered status from critically endangered status by the IUCN in 2008. The justification given includes its limited range, its restriction to only the Masoala Peninsula, and its risk from ongoing habitat loss and hunting. This species occupies a range of no more than , while the total wild population is estimated between 29,000 and 52,000 individuals. Red ruffed lemurs are only protected within the boundaries of the <a href="Masoala%20National%20Park">Masoala National Park</a>. Historically, this species has been considered more threatened due to its highly restricted range, compared to the widely distributed black-and-white ruffed lemur. However, its protection within the island's largest <a href="List%20of%20national%20parks%20of%20Madagascar">national park</a> has slightly improved its chances at survival. Despite this, an assessment done in 2012 and published in 2014 reinstated the critically endangered status for the red ruffed lemur, largely due to the surge in <a href="Illegal%20logging%20in%20Madagascar">illegal logging</a> in Masoala National Park following the <a href="2009%20Malagasy%20political%20crisis">2009 Malagasy political crisis</a>.

There are several organizations involved in ruffed lemur conservation, including the <a href="Durrell%20Wildlife%20Conservation%20Trust">Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust</a>, the <a href="Lemur%20Conservation%20Foundation">Lemur Conservation Foundation (LCF)</a>, the <a href="Madagascar%20Fauna%20Group">Madagascar Fauna Group (MFG)</a>, Monkeyland Primate Sanctuary in South Africa, <a href="Wildlife%20Trust%20%28US%29">Wildlife Trust</a>, and the <a href="Duke%20Lemur%20Center">Duke Lemur Center (DLC)</a>. To conservation organizations, the ruffed lemurs are considered <a href="Indicator%20species">indicator</a>, <a href="Umbrella%20species">umbrella</a>, and <a href="flagship%20species">flagship species</a>.

As with other primates, one of the principal threats to both ruffed lemur species is habitat loss due to <a href="slash-and-burn">slash-and-burn</a> agriculture, <a href="logging">logging</a>, and <a href="mining">mining</a>. Both species appear to be very sensitive to logging, and are thought to be the most vulnerable of rainforest lemurs. The <a href="hardwood">hardwood</a>s that are favored for construction materials and selectively logged are also preferred by ruffed lemurs for their fruits and potentially affect their travel routes through the canopy. <a href="Deforestation">Deforestation</a>, on the other hand, is a result of the need to provide firewood and to support <a href="subsistence%20agriculture">subsistence agriculture</a> and <a href="cash%20crop">cash crop</a>s. For red ruffed lemurs, Slash-and-burn agriculture, known locally as "tavy", is practiced seasonally on the Masoala peninsula between October and December, and its practice is expanding. Additionally, cattle are sometimes allowed to free-range over these former agricultural clearings, preventing forest re-growth.

Another principal threat to the survival of ruffed lemurs is hunting. Local human populations still hunt and trap ruffed lemurs with traditional weapons, using them as a source of subsistence. Studies from villages in the Makira Forest have revealed that ruffed lemur meat is not only the desired food but is being hunted unsustainably. On the Masoala peninsula, the calls of red ruffed lemurs help hunters locate them. On this peninsula, firearms are used in addition to traditional traps, known as "laly", which involve a strip of cleared forest with snares set on the few remaining branches that allow the lemurs to cross. Although hunting is illegal, the laws are generally not enforced and the local inhabitants show little concern about their hunting practices, which occur mostly from May to September. Hunting is the biggest concern in the Masoala peninsula because it is likely to continue, whereas logging and slash-and-burn agriculture could be curtailed. In other regions, hunters can scare away ruffed lemurs from their favorite food sources, even if they are hunting other prey. Lastly, these animals are taken from their natural habitats to display for tourists or are sold as <a href="exotic%20pet">exotic pet</a>s.

Frequent <a href="cyclone">cyclone</a>s also pose a threat, particularly to concentrated or small populations. In late January 1997, <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20South-West%20Indian%20Ocean%20cyclone%20season">Cyclone Gretelle</a> destroyed 80% of the Manombo forest canopy. With their habitat, including most of their food resources, effectively destroyed, the ruffed lemurs of the forest broadened their diet, remaining surprisingly frugivorous. Their body weights dropped and no births were reported for four years, but they managed to stave off starvation. This event demonstrated not only their flexibility in the face of natural disasters, which may highlight the evolutionary reasons behind their reproductive capacity and litter size but also the threat faced by already stressed populations.

Predation in the wild appears to be very rare for ruffed lemurs, probably because living in the high canopy makes them challenging to catch. Evidence of predation by raptors, such as the <a href="Henst%27s%20goshawk">Henst's goshawk</a> ("Accipiter henstii") suggests it occurs at a low rate. The <a href="fossa%20%28animal%29">fossa</a> ("Cryptoprocta ferox") could present a potential risk if it found an individual lower in the forest canopy, but no confirmation has been presented to indicate that they prey upon ruffed lemurs. Instead, only re-introduced, captive-bred ruffed lemurs have been killed by fossa, likely due to their inexperience with predators. Nesting behavior poses the biggest risk of predation, making them susceptible to carnivorous mammals, such as the <a href="ring-tailed%20mongoose">ring-tailed mongoose</a> ("Galidia elegans") and <a href="brown-tailed%20mongoose">brown-tailed mongoose</a> ("Salanoia concolor").

Captive populations of both ruffed lemur species exist in American and European zoos, representing a safeguard against extinction. In the United States, <a href="captive%20breeding">captive breeding</a> is managed by the <a href="Species%20Survival%20Plan">Species Survival Plan (SSP)</a>, a program developed by the <a href="Association%20of%20Zoos%20and%20Aquariums">Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA)</a>. Although the populations are very limited in their genetic diversity, these species thrive in captivity, making them an ideal candidate for <a href="reintroduction">reintroduction</a> into protected habitat, if it is available. Although reintroduction is seen as a last resort among <a href="Conservation%20movement">conservationists</a>, a combination of <a href="In%20situ%23Biology">in situ</a> conservation efforts, such as legal protection, public education, the spread of <a href="sustainability">sustainable livelihoods</a>, and <a href="reforestation">reforestation</a> offer hope for ruffed lemurs. In the meantime, reintroductions offer conservation research opportunities and allow the limited genetic diversity maintained by the SSP to improve the genetic diversity of dwindling Malagasy ruffed lemur populations.

A captive release first occurred in November 1997, when five black-and-white ruffed lemurs ("Varecia variegata variegata") born in the United States were returned to Madagascar for release in the <a href="Betampona%20Reserve">Betampona Strict Nature Reserve</a> in eastern Madagascar. Popularly known as the "Carolina Five", these individuals had lived their entire lives in the Natural Habitat Enclosures at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC). Since then, two more groups totaling 13 captive-born ruffed lemurs have been reintroduced into the same reserve, once in November 1998 and again in January 2001. These latter two groups also received "boot camp training" in the DLC forested free-range enclosures prior to release. So far, the results have shown some success, with 10 surviving longer than one year, 3 individuals integrating into wild groups, and 4 offspring have been born to or sired by released lemurs, all of which were parent-raised. Saraph, a male released with the first group, was reported to be doing well seven years post-release, living in a social group with a wild female and their offspring. Research has been ongoing since the initial release, as illustrated in the 1998 <a href="BBC">BBC</a> documentary "In the Wild: Operation Lemur with <a href="John%20Cleese">John Cleese</a>". The research has provided useful information about their adaptation to life in the wild.

Elizabeth Canning

Elizabeth Canning (married name Treat; 17 September 1734 – June 1773) was an English maidservant who claimed to have been kidnapped and held against her will in a hayloft for almost a month. She ultimately became central to one of the most famous English criminal mysteries of the 18th century.

She disappeared on 1 January 1753, before returning almost a month later to her mother's home in <a href="Aldermanbury">Aldermanbury</a> in the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>, emaciated and in a "deplorable condition". After being questioned by concerned friends and neighbours she was interviewed by the local <a href="alderman">alderman</a>, who then issued an arrest warrant for Susannah Wells, the woman who occupied the house in which Canning was supposed to have been held. At Wells' house in <a href="Enfield%20Wash">Enfield Wash</a>, Canning identified Mary Squires as another of her captors, prompting the arrest and detention of both Wells and Squires. London magistrate <a href="Henry%20Fielding">Henry Fielding</a> became involved in the case, taking Canning's side. Further arrests were made and several witness statements were taken, and Wells and Squires were ultimately tried and found guilty—Squires of the more serious and potentially capital charge of theft.

However, <a href="Crisp%20Gascoyne">Crisp Gascoyne</a>, trial judge and <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London">Lord Mayor of London</a>, was unhappy with the verdict and began his own investigation. He spoke with witnesses whose testimony implied that Squires and her family could not have abducted Canning, and he interviewed several of the prosecution's witnesses, some of whom recanted their earlier testimony. He ordered Canning's arrest, following which she was tried and found guilty of <a href="perjury">perjury</a>. Squires was pardoned, and Canning sentenced to one month's imprisonment and seven years of <a href="Penal%20transportation">transportation</a>.

Canning's case pitted two groups of believers against one another: the pro-Canning "Canningites", and the pro-Squires "<a href="Romani%20people%23Gypsy">Egyptians</a>". Gascoyne was openly abused and attacked in the street, while interested authors waged a fierce war of words over the fate of the young, often implacable maid. She died in <a href="Wethersfield%2C%20Connecticut">Wethersfield, Connecticut</a>, in 1773, but the mystery surrounding her disappearance remains unsolved.

Canning was born on 17 September 1734 in the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>, the eldest of five surviving children born to William (a carpenter) and Elizabeth Canning. The family lived in two rooms in Aldermanbury Postern (a northern extension of Aldermanbury that formerly ran from a <a href="postern%20gate">postern gate</a> on <a href="London%20Wall">London Wall</a> to Fore Street; it no longer exists) in London. Aldermanbury was a respectable but not particularly wealthy neighbourhood. Canning was born into poverty. Her father died in 1751 and her mother and four siblings shared a two-room property with James Lord, an apprentice. Lord occupied the building's front room, while Canning's family lived in the back room. Her schooling was limited to only a few months at a writing school, and aged 15 or 16 she worked as a maidservant in the household of nearby publican John Wintlebury, who considered her an honest but shy girl. From October 1752 she lived at the neighbouring home of a carpenter Edward Lyon, who shared Wintlebury's opinion of the young maidservant. Canning was described as a plump 18-year-old, about tall with a face pitted by <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, a long, straight nose, and wide-set eyes.

Canning disappeared on 1 January 1753. With no work that day, she spent time with her family and made plans to go shopping with her mother after visiting her aunt and uncle (Alice and Thomas Colley), but changed her mind and instead remained with them for the evening. At about 9 pm, accompanied by her aunt and uncle for about two-thirds of the journey, she left to return to her lodgings in Aldermanbury.

When she failed to return to her lodgings at Edward Lyon's house, her employer twice went looking for her at her mother's home. Mrs Canning sent her other three children to <a href="Moorfields">Moorfields</a> to search for her, while James Lord went to the Colleys, who told him that they had left Elizabeth at about 9:30 pm near <a href="St%20Botolph%27s%20Aldgate">Aldgate church</a> in <a href="Houndsditch">Houndsditch</a>. The next morning Mrs Canning also travelled to the Colleys' house, but to no avail, as Elizabeth was still missing. Neighbours were asked if they knew of her whereabouts, and weeks passed as Mrs Canning searched the neighbourhood for her daughter, while her relatives scoured the city. An advertisement was placed in the newspapers, prayers were read aloud in churches and meeting houses, but other than a report of a "woman's shriek" from a <a href="hackney%20coach">hackney coach</a> on 1 January, no clues were found as to Elizabeth's disappearance.

Canning reappeared at about 10 pm on 29 January 1753. At the sight of her daughter, whom she had not seen for almost a month, Elizabeth Canning fainted. Once recovered she sent James Lord to fetch several neighbours, and inside only a few minutes the house was full. Elizabeth was described as being in a "deplorable condition"; her face and hands were black with dirt, she wore a <a href="Chemise">shift</a>, a <a href="petticoat">petticoat</a>, and a <a href="bedgown">bedgown</a>. A dirty rag tied around her head was soaked with blood from a wounded ear. According to her story she had been attacked by two men near <a href="Bedlam%20Hospital">Bedlam Hospital</a>. They had partially stripped her, robbed her and hit her in the temple, rendering her unconscious. She awoke "by a large road, where was water, with the two men that robbed me" and was forced to walk to a house, where an old woman asked if she would "go their way" (become a prostitute). Canning had refused, and the woman cut off her corset, slapped her face and pushed her upstairs into a loft. There the young maidservant had remained for almost a month, with no visitors and existing only on bread and water. The clothing she wore she had scavenged from a fireplace in the loft. Canning had eventually made her escape by pulling some boards away from a window and walking the five-hour journey home. She recalled hearing the name "Wills or Wells", and as she had seen through the window a coachman she recognised, thought she had been held on the <a href="Hertford%20Road">Hertford Road</a>. On this evidence, John Wintlebury and a local journeyman, Robert Scarrat, identified the house as that of "Mother" Susannah Wells at <a href="Enfield%20Wash">Enfield Wash</a>, nearly distant.

Her reappearance and subsequent explanation (including the assumption that she had been held at Wells's house) were the following day printed in the "<a href="London%20Daily%20Advertiser">London Daily Advertiser</a>". She was visited by the <a href="apothecary">apothecary</a>, but with her pulse faint, and so weak she could scarcely speak, she vomited up the medicine he gave her. He administered several <a href="enema">glysters</a> until satisfied with the results, following which Canning was taken by her friends and neighbours to the <a href="Guildhall%2C%20London">Guildhall</a> to see Alderman <a href="Thomas%20Chitty%20%28Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London%29">Thomas Chitty</a>, to ask that he issue a warrant for Wells's arrest.

Chitty issued the warrant and on 1 February Canning's friends took her to <a href="Enfield%20Wash">Enfield Wash</a>. Despite her poor physical condition Canning's supporters wanted her to identify her captors and the room she claimed to have been held in, and worried she might die before then, took the risk of moving her. Wintlebury, Scarrat and Joseph Adamson (a neighbour) were the first to arrive, on horseback. They met the warrant officer and several peace officers, and waited for Susannah Wells to appear. Wells's house had served a variety of functions, including that of a carpenter's shop, a butchers and an ale-house. The old woman kept animals in the house and occasionally had lodgers. She had twice been widowed; her first husband was a carpenter and her second had been hanged for theft. She had also been imprisoned in 1736 for perjury. Sarah Howit, her daughter by her first husband, had lived there for about two years. Howit's brother John was a carpenter like his father, and lived nearby.

When at about 9 am Wells entered her house, the officers immediately moved to secure the building. Inside they found Wells, an old woman named Mary Squires, her children, Virtue Hall and a woman they supposed was Wells's daughter. Another woman, Judith Natus, was brought down from the loft to be questioned with the rest. The warrant officer who searched the loft was surprised when he discovered that it did not resemble the room described by Canning, and nor could he find evidence of her having jumped from the window. The rest of the party, who had by then arrived in a hired coach and <a href="chaise">chaise</a>, were similarly surprised.

Canning, who had arrived in the chaise with her mother and two other people, was carried into the house by Adamson. There she identified Mary Squires as the woman who had cut off her <a href="Corset">stays</a>, and claimed that Virtue Hall and a woman presumed to be Squires's daughter had been present at the time. Canning was then taken upstairs where she identified the loft as the room in which she had been imprisoned—although it contained more hay than she recalled. Boards covering the window appeared to have only recently been fastened there. With such damning evidence against them, the suspects were taken to a nearby <a href="justice%20of%20the%20peace">justice of the peace</a>, Merry Tyshemaker, who examined Canning alone, and then those from Wells's house. Squires and Wells were committed, the former for removing Canning's stays and the latter for "keeping a <a href="disorderly%20House">disorderly House</a>". George Squires and Virtue Hall, who both denied any involvement in the kidnapping, were set free; Canning and her supporters were allowed home.

Assault in 18th-century England was viewed by the authorities not as a breach of the peace, but rather as a civil action between two parties in dispute. The onus therefore was on Canning to take legal action against those she claimed had imprisoned her, and she would also be responsible for investigating the crime. This was an expensive proposition and she would therefore require the help of her friends and neighbours to pursue her case. An additional complication was that rather than send such matters to trial, justices preferred to reconcile the parties concerned. Therefore, although it was the state in which she returned to them on 29 January which most offended Canning's friends, it was the theft of her <a href="Corset">stays</a>—valued then at about 10 shillings—that was the most promising aspect of the case. The theft could be tried under a capital statute, making the assault charge less worthy of legal attention.

While Canning's medical treatment continued, her supporters, mostly men, prepared the case against Squires and Wells. They took legal advice from a <a href="solicitor">solicitor</a>, a Mr Salt, who advised them to consult the Magistrate and author <a href="Henry%20Fielding">Henry Fielding</a>. Fielding was 45 years old, and after years of arguments with other <a href="Grub%20Street">Grub Street</a> authors and a lifetime of drink, was approaching the end of his life. Since "<a href="Test%20Acts">taking the sacrament</a>" four years earlier and becoming a <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">Justice of the Peace</a> for <a href="Middlesex">Middlesex</a> and <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>, he had, with "volcanic energy", concerned himself with the activities of criminals. In December 1751 he had published "<a href="Amelia%20%28novel%29">Amelia</a>", a story of a young woman dragged into vice and folly by her abusive husband. Although the book was poorly received, with his experience of <a href="criminology">criminology</a> Fielding believed he understood the depths to which humans could descend. Thus when Salt divulged the case to him on 6 February Fielding's curiosity was piqued, and he agreed to take Canning's sworn testimony the next day. Although Fielding was disinclined to believe a simple servant-girl he was impressed with her modesty and genteel manner, and issued a warrant against all the occupants of Wells's house, "that they might appear before me, [and] give Security for their good Behaviour". Virtue Hall and Judith Natus were thus seized, but George Squires, his sisters, and Wells's daughter Sarah Howit, had by then left the house and remained at large.

The "London Daily Advertiser", a <a href="Grub%20Street">Grub Street</a> publication, reported on 10 February:

Meanwhile Canning's supporters were soliciting donations through the "Case of Elizabeth Canning", an independently printed pamphlet designed to raise support for the prosecution of her captors. In the "Case of", Wells was clearly identified as "that Monster of a Woman", and in an edited version which appeared a week later in the "<a href="Public%20Advertiser">Public Advertiser</a>" it was revealed that Canning had suffered a fit after being struck on the head. Squires was called an "old Gypsy Woman", who "robbed the girl of her stays; and then in a miserable naked Condition, because she would not become a common Prostitute, confined her in an old Back Room or loft". Although Squires was often referred to as a <a href="Names%20of%20the%20Romani%20people%23Gypsy">gypsy</a> this identification had, on occasion, been called into question. Being named a gypsy could carry certain legal penalties and although these were rarely applied, gypsies were nevertheless treated as pariahs. Moore (1994) described Squires as a "dark, tall, but stooping, elderly woman, with an estimated age ranging from sixty to eighty, sometimes depicted as exceptionally hearty", continuing "all accounts do agree that she was an exceptionally ugly woman, with a very large nose and a lower lip swollen and disfigured by <a href="scrofula">scrofula</a>."

Therefore, for a while, the public were firmly on Canning's side. An 18-year-old servant girl threatened with prostitution and held captive by a remarkably ugly old gypsy of bad repute, having escaped, emaciated, to return to her loving mother; it was a story that the vast bulk of general public as well as the gentry, found irresistible.

Fielding prided himself upon his fairness—no matter what the social standing of the witness—he subjected Hall to repeated questioning and, frustrated at her contradictory answers, threatened her with imprisonment. This had the desired effect because on 14 February Hall stated that John Squires (son of Mary) and another man had brought Canning to Wells's house early on the morning of 2 January. There, before the two kidnappers, Lucy Squires and Hall, the old woman had assaulted Canning and forced her upstairs, where she remained until her escape. Hall said that Fortune Natus and his wife Judith had been at the house for some weeks but were moved into the loft to make it appear as though they had stayed there throughout January. Hall's and Canning's evidence now tallied almost perfectly, and Fielding turned to Judith Natus. Although she corroborated Hall's claim that she and her husband had slept in Wells's loft throughout January, Fielding was unconvinced and urged her to reconsider her statement. Although not charged with any crime, Hall meanwhile was committed to the <a href="Gatehouse%20Prison">Gatehouse Prison</a> in <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>, her stay paid for by the Canningites. Fielding left London for a short while before returning to interview Squires, Wells and the others. Wells and Squires denied any knowledge of Canning or her travails, and strongly protested their innocence. This had little credence, due to the long-standing habit of the accused of breaking the law and lying about it.
The story as it had appeared in the "London Daily Advertiser" had already aroused the public's interest. Fielding had left London believing that he had "ended all the trouble which I thought it necessary for me to give myself in this affair", but on his return he learnt that during his brief absence, amongst others, several "Noble Lords" had attempted to contact him. On 15 February a reward was offered for the capture and conviction of John Squires and his unnamed associate. Also listed were the locations at which donations could be left, "either applied to the carrying on of the Prosecution, or given to the poor Girl as a Recompence for her Virtue, and Miseries she has gone through". A rather embellished account of the story was later sent to the press. George Squires could not be found.

Squires, charged with assault and theft, and Wells, with "well-knowing" what her accomplice had done, were tried on 21 February at the Session House of the <a href="Old%20Bailey">Old Bailey</a>. The Lord Mayor of London Sir <a href="Crisp%20Gascoyne">Crisp Gascoyne</a> presided over the court with a panel of other justices, including <a href="Martin%20Wright%20%28judge%29">Martin Wright</a> (<a href="Justice%20of%20the%20King%27s%20Bench">Justice of the King's Bench</a>), <a href="Nathaniel%20Gundry">Nathaniel Gundry</a> (<a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Common%20Pleas">Justice of the Common Pleas</a>), <a href="Richard%20Adams%20%28judge%29">Richard Adams</a> (<a href="Baron%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Baron of the Exchequer</a> since 1753; formerly <a href="Recorder%20of%20London">Recorder of London</a>), and <a href="William%20Moreton%20%28judge%29">William Moreton</a> (appointed Recorder of London in 1753). The gallery was packed with interested spectators. The charge of theft was extremely serious; the value of Canning's stays (about 10 shillings) meant that if she was found guilty, Squires would almost certainly be hanged at the <a href="Tyburn%20Tree">Tyburn Tree</a>.

As she arrived at the court Canning was cheered by the large crowd gathered outside the building. Inside, she testified that she was taken by two men "to the prisoner Wells's house" at about 4 am on the morning of 2 January. In the kitchen, the old woman (Squires) was sat in a chair and asked her "if I chose to go their way". Canning's refusal had prompted Squires to cut off her stays, slap her face, and push her up the stairs into a darkened room. She told the court she "saw nothing brought up[, but w]hen day-light appeared, I could see about the room; there was a fire-place and a grate in it, no bed nor bedstead, nothing but hay to lie upon; there was a black pitcher not quite full of water, and about twenty-four pieces of bread ... about a quartern loaf". She claimed to have escaped by removing a board from a window at the north end of the loft, climbing out, and jumping down to the soft clay below. She fled along a lane behind the house, through some fields, and on finding a road set out for London. When asked if she had seen or spoken to anyone on the way back, she replied that she had not, explaining that she had shied away from contact for fear of meeting somebody from the house she had escaped from. Canning was cross-examined by <a href="William%20Davy%20%28lawyer%29">William Davy</a>, who questioned her recollection of events in the house. Asked why she had not attempted escape earlier she replied: "Because I thought they might let me out; it never came into my head till that [Monday] morning." Squires, who had been quietly muttering to herself in the dock, shouted "I never saw that witness in my lifetime till this day three weeks".
Next to appear on the stand was Virtue Hall, who recounted much of her earlier statement to Fielding. Squires again interrupted, asking "What day was it that the young woman was robbed?" The answer came back, from the court: "She says on the morning of the 2nd of January", and Squires replied "I return thanks for telling me, for I am as innocent as the child unborn". Susannah Wells used the opportunity to ask how long Squires and her family were supposed to have been at the house, and was answered by Hall "They were there six or seven weeks in all; they had been there about a fortnight before the young woman was brought in". Amongst others, Thomas Colley and Mrs Canning also gave testimony. Canning's former employer, John Wintlebury, told the court how he had deduced that it was Wells's house where Canning had been held. Mary Myers and James Lord also claimed to have heard Canning say "Wills or Wells", as did Robert Scarrat, a <a href="hartshorn">hartshorn</a>-rasper and previously a servant in nearby <a href="Edmonton%2C%20London">Edmonton</a> who had visited Wells's house on previous occasions.

Although both were subpoenaed as witnesses neither Fortune nor Judith Natus were called to the stand, the attorney responsible later explaining that the mob outside may have intimidated several witnesses. Susannah Wells's neighbours were turned away by the mob and her daughter and half-brother were quickly recognised and stopped. However, three witnesses found in Dorset by George Squires, to testify for his mother, passed by unrecognised. The first, John Gibbons, said that the Squires had visited his house in <a href="Abbotsbury">Abbotsbury</a> "with handkerchiefs, lawns, muslins, and checks, to sell about town" from 1–9 January. This was corroborated by his neighbour, William Clarke. Squires's last witness, Thomas Greville, claimed that he had accommodated Mary and "her sister and her brother" under his roof in Coombe, on 14 January, where they sold "handkerchiefs, lawns, and such things". This was contradicted by John Iniser, a <a href="fishmonger">fishmonger</a> around <a href="Waltham%20Cross">Waltham Cross</a> and <a href="Theobalds">Theobalds</a>. Insier claimed he knew Squires by sight and that in the three weeks before her arrest he had seen her telling fortunes in the neighbourhood of Wells's house. Wells, whose witnesses had been unable to pass by the mob outside, was able to offer only two sentences in her defence. She told the court that she had not seen Canning before 1 February, and that "as to Squires, I never saw her above a week and a day before we were taken up." According to a contemporary report in the "<a href="London%20Daily%20Advertiser">London Daily Advertiser</a>", as the three witnesses left the court the mob, waiting in the yard, "beat them, kicked them rolled them in the Kennel and otherwise misused them before they suffered them to get from them".

Character witnesses in 18th-century English trials were, according to author Douglas Hay, "extremely important, and very frequently used ... in character testimony too, the word of a man of property had the greatest weight. Judges respected the evidence of employers, farmers and neighboring gentlemen, not mere neighbors and friends." The jury were apparently unimpressed by the defence's case and pronounced both defendants guilty. They were sentenced on 26 February; Wells would be <a href="Branding%20persons">branded</a> in her hand and spend six months in prison. For stealing Canning's stays, Squires was to be hanged. By March 1753 pamphlets on Canning's story were being read in the coffee-houses of London. There was widespread outrage over Squires' treatment of her, exacerbated when Little Jemmy, "a poor man who cries sticks about the streets" was supposedly robbed and then stamped on by five gypsies. Canning was celebrated by the mob and gentry, several of whom contributed to her purse, enabling her to move to better accommodation in the house of a Mr Marshall, a cheesemonger in Aldermanbury.

Not everybody was satisfied with the verdict. The trial judge Sir Crisp Gascoyne and some of his colleagues on the bench found Canning's story extremely unlikely. Gascoyne had been disgusted by Canning's supporters, who while outside the court had prevented witnesses from giving evidence, and he was particularly sympathetic to Mary Squires, whom he named "the poor creature". Then 52 years old, Gascoyne had started life as a <a href="Houndsditch">Houndsditch</a> <a href="Brewing">brewer</a> before he married the daughter of a wealthy physician. He had progressed through the ranks to become Master of the Brewer's Company, then served as Alderman of <a href="Vintry">Vintry Ward</a>, <a href="Sheriffs%20of%20the%20City%20of%20London">Sheriff of London</a>, and been <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Knighthood">knighted</a> after presenting an address to the king. He had argued on behalf of the city's orphans and was known for his benevolence in <a href="Essex">Essex</a>, where he owned large estates.

Gascoyne at once began a private enquiry and wrote to the Anglican minister at Abbotsville, James Harris. He thought it unlikely that the three witnesses found by George Squires would travel so far "to foreswear themselves on behalf of this miserable object" and Harris did not disappoint. The Reverend was able to corroborate Gibbons's testimony and offer new witnesses who could claim to have seen Squires well away from Enfield Wash. Gascoyne also thought that some of the Canningites doubted the girl's veracity and had colluded in her version of events to spite him; this, he thought, was a political attack on a public official and he refused to let the matter rest. He justified his activities by comparing his apparent compassion for the victim, Mary Squires, with his outrage for the deceit of her accuser, Elizabeth Canning, but his fervour was influenced in part by the attitudes of the time. He considered the behaviour of the Canningites inappropriate for their low station and was more impressed by the assurances of people such as Alderman Chitty and Reverend Harris, who as gentlemen and public advocates were presumed more reliable.

Gascoyne's colleague on the bench, Mr Justice Gundry, had written to the <a href="Undersheriff">Undersheriff</a> of Dorset, who knew John Gibbons and William Clarke. The Undersheriff wrote back claiming that they "would not have given evidence had it not been true". Clarke may have been in a relationship with Lucy Squires, and claimed that he had stayed with the Squires in Ridgeway. Fifteen prominent residents of Abbotsbury, including churchwardens, <a href="Overseer%20of%20the%20Poor">Overseers of the Poor</a>, a schoolmaster and a <a href="Tithing">tithing man</a> swore that the Squires were in Dorset in January and that their witnesses were trustworthy men. A further six Abbotsbury men walked to sign an affidavit corroborating their neighbours' evidence.

Fielding and Gascoyne had each issued contradictory pamphlets on the case, but it was Virtue Hall's testimony, fundamental in the prosecution of Squires and Wells, which became central to Gascoyne's investigation. Hall had given her testimony to Fielding under threat of imprisonment and when by chance the <a href="Grub%20Street">Grub Street</a> writer <a href="John%20Hill%20%28author%29">John Hill</a> heard from a Magistrate that she had showed signs of remorse, he was presented with a perfect opportunity to settle an old score. A prodigious writer and author of a renowned newspaper column, "The Inspector", Hill had squabbled with several of his peers, notably so in Fielding's case, as Fielding had closed that argument in his "<a href="The%20Covent-Garden%20Journal">Covent Garden Journal</a>" by stating that "this "hill" was only a paltry "dunghill", and had long before been levelled with the dirt."

Supported by the Canningites, Hall was by then staying at the <a href="Gatehouse%20Prison">Gatehouse Prison</a>, although still not charged with any crime. Hill immediately communicated his concerns to Gascoyne, who sent for the young woman. Accompanied by a contingent of Canningites, her answers were at first noncommittal, but once isolated from Canning's friends she soon admitted to Gascoyne that she had perjured herself. She was committed to the <a href="Poultry%20Compter">Poultry Compter</a>, where the Canningites continued to support her until they learnt that "particular persons only" were allowed to visit. Hall was again questioned on 7 March, by both Gascoyne and Canning's supporters. When asked why she had lied to the court, she said "when I was at Mr Fielding's I at first spoke the truth, but was told it was not the truth. I was terrified and threatened to be sent to Newgate, and prosecuted as a felon, unless I should speak the truth." She was asked by one of her supporters if she was still lying, but her replies were deemed inconclusive and having confessed to and denied most of the things about which she was questioned, each side began to see her as a liability.

Reverend Harris had several of his witnesses sent to London, where they were interviewed by Gascoyne. In <a href="Newgate%20Prison">Newgate Prison</a> on 9 March, Gascoyne also interviewed Susannah Wells, who confirmed Hall's new version of events. He then performed several interviews from 12–13 March, including Fortune and Judith Natus, and a witness who could cast doubt on John Iniser's testimony. Gascoyne also asked George and Lucy Squires about their travels early in 1753; George was unable to recall all the places they had visited, and so Gascoyne sent him to Dorset to help him remember. Gascoyne then met with Elizabeth Long (Wells's daughter), who had been prevented by the mob from testifying for her mother, and on 23 March three of Canning's former witnesses expressed to Gascoyne their doubts about the young maid's story. Another witness, who swore that Squires had been in Abbotsbury in January, was interviewed two days later. Gascoyne instructed him to visit Squires in Newgate, where the two recognised one another immediately.

Meanwhile, John Myles, who had replaced Salt and who now led the Canningites, had been gathering witnesses who could claim they had seen Mary Squires in the vicinity of Enfield Wash. One said he had seen two men dragging a woman towards Enfield early in January. Others told him they had on 29 January seen "a miserable poor wretch" travelling toward London. Myles found witnesses who claimed they had seen Squires at Enfield Wash in December and January. Myles unwittingly made Gascoyne aware of his investigation when he asked a John Cooper of <a href="Salisbury">Salisbury</a> his opinion of seven of Gascoyne's witnesses, who claimed they had seen Squires in Coombe. Cooper wrote back affirming the good character of Thomas Greville (who had testified for Squires at her trial), but later sent the same information to Gascoyne, offering his support.

At this point it appeared certain to Gascoyne that Canning had not told the truth. Through January, he thought, the Squires had very likely been travelling through Dorset, <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, and then <a href="London">London</a>, and had not been in Enfield Wash to kidnap Canning. On 13 March, he therefore ordered Canning arrested, for perjury.

Gascoyne's investigation caused a press frenzy. The output of the writers and publishers of Grub Street emboldened opinions about the case, and in some instances reinforced long-held stereotypes of "wicked Gypsies and a poor innocent girl refusing to yield her honour". The Canningites stirred up anti-gypsy sentiment with a range of pamphlets and advertisements, one of which named the now deeply unpopular Gascoyne "the King of the Gipsies". Reports began to emerge, of sinister goings-on; one such claimed that several men on horseback threatened that "they would burn all the people's houses, barns and corn thereabouts", should Squires be hanged.
Canning's honesty (or lack of it) and Fielding's handling of the case were raised in a deeply critical attack printed by "The London Daily Advertiser". On the same day that Gascoyne ordered Canning's arrest an advertisement appeared in the "Public Advertiser", asking its readers "to suspend their judgement in the Case of the Gypsy Woman till a full State of the whole, which is now being prepared by Mr. Fielding, is published." Fielding had learnt of Hall's questioning by Gascoyne and had brought Canning to his house in <a href="Bow%20Street">Bow Street</a>, to "sift the truth out of her, and to bring her to confession if she was guilty." Satisfied with her account, and unconcerned with Hall, his critique of Squires' supporters was published as "A Clear Statement of the Case of Elizabeth Canning", in which he espoused the virtuous nature of the young maid and attacked those her detractors. Copies sold so quickly that a second print run was ordered two days later. John Hill saw "A Clear Statement" as a direct attack on Gascoyne, and blasted Fielding with "The Story of Elizabeth Canning Considered", which ridiculed his enemy with such comments as: "Who Sir, are you, that are thus dictating unto the Government? Retire into yourself and know your station." Fielding, however, played little part in the saga from thereon, believing that Canning's supporters had begun to see him as an obstacle to their case.

About half of those condemned to death during the 18th century went not to the gallows, but to prison, or colonies abroad. Although pardons were not common, it was possible to bypass the Judge and petition the king directly, and although Gascoyne had some concerns about the character of the witnesses upon whom he was able to call, he nevertheless wrote to <a href="George%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George II</a> to request that Squires be pardoned. On 10 April 1753 therefore the king granted a stay of execution of six weeks, while new evidence on both sides of the case was sent to the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> <a href="Philip%20Yorke%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Hardwicke">Lord Hardwicke</a> and the Attorney and Solicitor-General. Squires would receive her pardon on 30 May 1753, but Wells was less fortunate; she served her sentence and was released from Newgate on 21 August.

While Squires's eventual pardon was being deliberated upon, Myles was busy building Canning's defence. He was far from complacent; on 20 April he was in <a href="Dorchester%2C%20Dorset">Dorchester</a> with a warrant for the arrest of Gibbons, Clark and Greville, the three Abbotsbury men who had testified for Squires. With a small armed party he captured Gibbons and Clarke at the local inn and took them back to Dorchester, but his warrant was incorrectly worded and Gibbons was released by the justice. Clarke was taken to London and interrogated by Myles at his house, for two days, but the cordwainer refused to cooperate. He was granted bail and returned to Abbotsbury.

The three were charged with "wilful corrupt perjury" and tried on 6 September 1753 at the Old Bailey. As Lord Mayor, and fearing accusations of bias, Gascoyne excused himself from the case. The defendants were represented by William Davy, who had earlier defended Squires and Wells. Over 100 people were present to testify on their behalf, but the Canningites stayed away; they were unaware of Gascoyne's withdrawal and feared an embarrassing release of evidence to the public from an appearance by Canning. They also kept their witnesses away; with the exception of one of Mrs Canning's neighbours, none were present. Myles had not been paid by his employers, and to delay proceedings, his brother Thomas sent a clerk to deliver to the court a selection of writs, but nevertheless Gibbons, Clark, and Greville were found not guilty, and released.

At this point Canning had not been seen publicly for some time, and she was proclaimed an outlaw. When in November 1753 a new Lord Mayor was installed she remained out of sight, but at the February Sessions in 1754 she reappeared at the Old Bailey and presented herself to the authorities.

Canning's trial began at the Old Bailey on Monday 29 April 1754, continuing on Wednesday 1 May, 3–4 May, 6–7 May and ending on 8 May—an unusually long trial for the time. During jury selection the defence objected to three potential jurors (much less than the Crown's 17 objections) but were too late to argue the choice of foreman, who, it was claimed, had publicly called Canning "a LYING B——H, a CHEAT, or an IMPOSTER". Presiding over the courtroom was the new Lord Mayor, <a href="Thomas%20Rawlinson%20%28Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London%201753%29">Thomas Rawlinson</a> (Crisp Gascoyne's successor <a href="Edward%20Ironside">Edward Ironside</a> having died in office in November 1753), with <a href="Edward%20Clive%20%28judge%29">Edward Clive</a> (Justice of the Common Pleas), <a href="Heneage%20Legge%20%28judge%29">Heneage Legge</a> (Baron of the Exchequer), William Moreton (Recorder of London), and <a href="Sir%20Samuel%20Fludyer%2C%201st%20Baronet">Samuel Fludyer</a>, alderman. Canning was represented by three attorneys, <a href="George%20Nares%20%28judge%29">George Nares</a>, John Morton and a Mr Williams. Prosecuting was Gascoyne's son <a href="Bamber%20Gascoyne%20%28senior%29">Bamber</a>, <a href="Edward%20Willes%20%281723%E2%80%931787%29">Edward Willes</a> and <a href="William%20Davy%20%28lawyer%29">William Davy</a>. After her indictment was read by the Clerk of Arraigns the story of Canning's supposed abduction and imprisonment was retold by Bamber Gascoyne. Then Davy spoke at length. He attacked Canning's story and told how Squires and her family had travelled through England with smuggled goods to sell. He offered new evidence to support Squires' alibi and rubbished Canning's description of her prison, before questioning her account of her escape. He concluded with Virtue Hall's recantation of her earlier testimony. Willes was the next to speak, picking over the discrepancies between the various accounts offered by Canning of her disappearance.
Canning's defence began with opening statements from Williams and Morton. The latter emphasised her misfortune at twice being subjected to such anguish, firstly for prosecuting her assailants and secondly for being punished for doing so. He complimented the jury and poured scorn on Davy's allegations, and seized upon the prosecution's unwillingness to call Virtue Hall to the stand. Morton highlighted how unlikely it was that Canning could so profoundly fool her supporters and countered the prosecution's complaint about Canning's description of the loft. The third attorney, George Nares, concentrated on the societal problems of prosecuting Canning for perjury, implying that other victims of crime would be less likely to pursue their assailants, for fear of being prosecuted themselves.

Morton questioned George Squires, who could not recall with absolute certainty the path he claimed his family took through the south of England while Canning was missing. His sister Lucy was not called to the stand, as she was considered "rather more stupid than her brother, and has not been on the road since their coming to Enfield Wash". Robert Willis, who had accompanied Squires to retrace the gypsy family's steps, was also called to testify; his evidence was judged as hearsay and ruled inadmissible. As in the trial of Squires and Wells, the reliability of the prosecutor's witnesses was considered dependent upon their character. Three men from <a href="Litton%20Cheney">Litton Cheney</a> testified that they had seen the Squires family enter the village on 30 December. The three Abbotsbury men then stepped up and gave their evidence. 39 witnesses for the prosecution were heard on the first day alone; most of them establishing briefly the Squires family's alibi.

At the end of the first day's proceedings the mob outside, expecting a short trial and a not guilty verdict, were presented not with the young maid but rather with Crisp Gascoyne. Infuriated, they threw dirt and stones at him, forcing him to retreat to a nearby inn, before returning to the court to escort Canning away from the building. On 1 May therefore the trial continued not with a resumption of the first day's examination, but with concern over the attack on Gascoyne. A guard was found to protect him and the jury, a member of Canning's defence was forced to apologise, and the Canningites later that day printed a notice appealing to the crowd to not interfere. Alderman Thomas Chitty was sworn in and, guided by Bamber Gascoyne, gave his account of his first meeting with Canning on 31 January 1753. Davy questioned several witnesses, who described the discrepancies in Canning's account of her prison. One of them told of his disgust at Virtue Hall's testimony against Squires. Along with several other witnesses including Sarah Howit, Fortune and Judith Natus testified that Canning had never been in the loft before 1 February and that it was in fact Howit and Virtue Hall who had been in the loft in January. The end of the day's proceedings was again overshadowed by the mob outside, and Gascoyne was accorded an escort of "a Body of Constables".

Friday saw yet more witnesses for the prosecution, bringing the total brought by Davy to about 60. The defence questioned several of those present at the original search of Wells's house. Canning's uncle, Thomas Colley, was cross-examined about what his niece ate on her visit of New Year's Day, the prosecution apparently seeking to establish whether or not she could have been sustained for a month by the bread she claimed to have been given. On the third day of the trial, Mrs Canning was brought to the stand. One possible line of defence for her daughter was simply that she was too stupid to have ever invented the tale, but under cross-examination by Davy Mrs Canning demonstrated that her daughter was capable of writing "a little". This, in Davy's view, was sufficient to demonstrate that she was certainly no imbecile. Scarrat was questioned next, and admitted that he had been to Wells's house before Canning had disappeared. Two of Canning's neighbours testified to her "deplorable condition". Her employer was questioned, as was her apothecary, who thought that Canning would have been quite able to survive on the pitcher of water and crusts of bread she claimed to have been given. The defence responded with three witnesses, who each believed that they had encountered a "poor, miserable wretch" at the end of January, when she claimed to have escaped.
On 6 May more witnesses for the prosecution were called. As Squires and her family watched, several of Wells's neighbours insisted they had, about the beginning of 1753, seen the old gypsy in the area. More witnesses claimed to have seen her in various places around Enfield Wash, including one woman who swore she had seen her on Old Christmas Day. Britain's calendar had in September 1752 changed from the old-style <a href="Julian%20calendar">Julian calendar</a>, to the <a href="Gregorian%20calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>, and the woman was unable to discern the exact day on which she claimed to have seen Squires. She was not alone; several of the defence's witnesses were also unable to manage the 11-day correction required by the calendar change. Others were illiterate, and struggled similarly. The court also heard from three witnesses present solely to discredit the testimony offered by the Natuses.

The final day's proceedings were taken up by Davy, who produced more prosecution witnesses, and proceeded to pick apart the testimony of those who claimed to have seen Squires in Enfield Wash, in January. He summarised the prosecution's case by telling the jury that Canning was guilty of "the most impious and detestable [crime] the human heart can conceive". The recorder, William Moreton, stated the defence's case, and asked the jury to consider if they thought that Canning had answered the charges against her to their satisfaction, and if it was possible she could have survived for almost a month on "no more than a quartern-loaf, and a pitcher of water".

The jury took almost two hours to find Canning "Guilty of perjury, but not wilful and corrupt." The recorder refused to accept the verdict as it was partial, and the jury then took a further 20 minutes to find her "Guilty of Wilful and Corrupt Perjury." Crisp Gascoyne was not present when the verdict was delivered; he had been advised to leave earlier, to avoid any trouble outside the court. The defence tried unsuccessfully for a retrial. Canning, held at Newgate prison, was sentenced on 30 May. By a majority of nine to eight, she was given a month's imprisonment, to be followed by seven years' <a href="Penal%20transportation">transportation</a>. According to the "State Trials", Canning spoke, and "hoped they would be favourable to her; that she had no intent of swearing the gypsey's life away; and that what had been done, was only defending herself; and desired to be considered unfortunate".
The verdict did nothing to assuage the ferocity of the debate. Transcripts of the trial were extremely popular, and portraits of the implacable young maid were offered for sale from shop windows. A reward was offered for information on anyone who had attacked Gascoyne, but mainly the Grub Street press concerned itself with the fallout from the affair. The "Gazeteer" was filled with satirical letters between such authors as Aristarchus, Tacitus, and T. Trueman, Esq. One such, a Canningite called Nikodemus, complained that without gypsies, "what would become of your young nobility and gentry, if there were no bawds to procure young girls of pleasure for them?" Those on Squires's side were not the only ones to come under such attacks; John Hill wrote a short song celebrating his and Gascoyne's role in the affair, and pictures of Canning in the loft, her bodice loosened to reveal her bosom, were readily available. Another showed Wells and Squires held aloft by a broomstick, an obvious allusion to <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a>.

Gascoyne had stood for Parliament during Canning's trial, but came bottom of the poll. To justify his pursuit of Canning, he wrote "An Address to the Liverymen of the City of London, from Sir Crisp Gascoyne", and suffered not only literary but physical attacks, as well as death threats. The Canningites published several responses to Gascoyne's thoughts, including "A liveryman's reply to Sir Crisp Gascoyne's address", and "A refutation of Sir Crisp Gascoyne's of his conduct in the cases of Elizabeth Canning and Mary Squires", the latter presenting the trial as the culmination of a Gascoyne vendetta against Canning.

Canning, held at Newgate, was reported to be in the presence of <a href="Methodists">Methodists</a>, an unfortunate accusation for her side. On the same day this report appeared, handbills were circulated asserting that the Rector of <a href="St%20Mary%20Magdalen%20Old%20Fish%20Street">St Mary Magdalen</a> had visited her and was satisfied that she was still a member of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>. Among her visitors was Mr Justice Ledinard, who had helped deliver Virtue Hall to Gascoyne. Ledinard asked Canning to confess but was told by Canning that "I have said the whole truth in court, and nothing but the truth; and I don't choose to answer any questions, unless it be in court again." Despite calls for clemency, she was taken to the convict ship "Tryal" for her voyage to <a href="British%20America">British America</a>. Several threats made by the ship's crew, however, meant she eventually sailed on board the "Myrtilla" in August 1754. Canning arrived in <a href="Wethersfield%2C%20Connecticut">Wethersfield, Connecticut</a>, and by arrangement with her supporters went to live with the Methodist Reverend <a href="Elisha%20Williams">Elisha Williams</a>. She was not employed as a servant, but was taken in as a member of Williams' family. Williams died in 1755, and Canning married John Treat (a distant relation of the former governor Robert Treat) on 24 November 1756, had a son (Joseph Canning Treat) in June 1758, and a daughter (Elizabeth) in November 1761. She had two more sons (John and Salmon), but died suddenly in June 1773.

For Georgian England, the story of Elizabeth Canning was fascinating. Little attention was paid in the trial to Squires's request for Canning to "go their way"; according to Moore (1994), overtly the saga questioned Canning's chastity, while covertly it questioned whether someone of her social standing had any right to be taken notice of (in view of the immense interest taken in the case, this last seems unlikely). The author Kristina Straub compares the case with the more general debate over the sexuality of female servants; Canning may have been either a "childlike innocent, victimized by brutally criminal outlaws", or "a wily manipulator of the justice system who uses innocent bystanders to escape the consequences of her own sexual misdeeds". "The Case of Elizabeth Canning Fairly Stated" posited that Canning either suffered imprisonment to protect her virtue, or lied to conceal "her own criminal Transactions in the Dark". Straub opines that the debate was not merely about Canning's guilt or innocence, but rather "the kinds of sexual identity that were attributable to women of her position in the social order." 

The partisan nature of the Canningites and the Egyptians ensured that the trial of Elizabeth Canning became one of the most notorious criminal mysteries in 18th-century English law. For years the case was a regular feature in such publications as "<a href="The%20Newgate%20Calendar">The Newgate Calendar</a>" and the "<a href="Malefactor%27s%20Registers">Malefactor's Registers</a>". Artist <a href="Allan%20Ramsay%20%28artist%29">Allan Ramsay</a> wrote "A Letter to the Right Honourable the Earl of  — Concerning the Affair of Elizabeth Canning", which was the inspiration for <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>'s "Histoire d'Elisabeth Canning, et de Jean Calas" (1762), who shared Ramsay's opinion that Canning had gone missing to hide a pregnancy. The case was revisited in 1820 by <a href="James%20Caulfield">James Caulfield</a>, who retold the story but with several glaring mistakes. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries several authors offered their own interpretations of the case. Caulfield's essay was followed in 1852 by <a href="John%20Paget%20%28barrister%29">John Paget</a>'s "Elizabeth Canning". Paget's apt summary of the case read: "in truth, perhaps, the most complete and most inexplicable Judicial Puzzle on record".

Canning's trial was marked by the prosecution's inability to find any evidence whatsoever that she had been anywhere but in Wells's home, and where Canning was in January 1753 remains unknown. Similarly, mystery surrounds the precise movements of the Squires family, when it was supposed they were travelling through Dorset early in 1753. The writer <a href="F.%20J.%20Harvey%20Darton">F. J. Harvey Darton</a> suspected that the family were <a href="smuggler">smuggler</a>s, and that it was significant they had passed through <a href="Eggardon%20Hill">Eggardon</a>, where <a href="Isaac%20Gulliver">Isaac Gulliver</a> operated (although Gulliver was, at the time, a child). The 18th-century artist <a href="Allan%20Ramsay%20%28artist%29">Allan Ramsay</a> claimed that Canning's initial story was "exceedingly stupid", and false. He viewed the lack of detail in her testimony as unsurprising to a more analytical mind. The US author <a href="Lillian%20de%20la%20Torre">Lillian Bueno McCue</a> theorised that she was an amnesiac, and that her former employer, John Wintlebury, was to blame for her imprisonment at the Wells house. Treherne (1989) considers this theory very unlikely however, and instead concludes that Canning was almost certainly at Enfield Wash, but was not kept prisoner at Wells's home. He suggests that Robert Scaratt implanted the suggestion that Canning had been held at the Wells's house, as a useful decoy, and that he had somehow been involved in an unwanted pregnancy. Treherne also suggests that Canning was suffering from partial amnesia, and that she may not have lied intentionally at the trial of Squires and Wells. He calls Canning "the first media product." Although some early authors adopted the same stance as Fielding or Hill, who actively took sides in the affair, most later writers believe that Canning did not tell the truth. Moore (1994), however, believes that Canning was probably innocent. Moore explains discrepancies between Canning and the Squires' testimonies as understandable omissions and modifications, and placing much emphasis on the ability of those men in power to follow their own pursuits—often at the expense of others.

Flight Unlimited

Flight Unlimited is a 1995 <a href="aerobatics">aerobatic</a> <a href="flight%20simulator">flight simulator</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed and published by <a href="Looking%20Glass%20Studios">Looking Glass Technologies</a>. It allows players to pilot reproductions of real-world <a href="Fixed-wing%20aircraft">aircraft</a> and to perform <a href="aerobatic%20maneuver">aerobatic maneuver</a>s. They may fly freely, race through floating rings against a timer or take lessons from a virtual <a href="flight%20instructor">flight instructor</a>. The instructor teaches basic and advanced techniques, ranging from <a href="rudder">rudder</a> turns to maneuvers such as the <a href="tailslide">tailslide</a>, <a href="Lomcov%C3%A1k">Lomcovák</a> and <a href="Immelmann%20turn">Immelmann turn</a>.

"Flight Unlimited" was the first self-published game released by Looking Glass Technologies. It was intended to establish the company as a <a href="video%20game%20publisher">video game publisher</a> and to compete with flight simulator franchises such as "<a href="Microsoft%20Flight%20Simulator">Microsoft Flight Simulator</a>". Project leader <a href="Seamus%20Blackley">Seamus Blackley</a>, a <a href="particle%20physics">particle physicist</a> and amateur pilot, conceived the game in 1992. He felt that other flight simulators failed to convey the experience of real flight, and he reacted by coding a simulated atmosphere for "Flight Unlimited" based on real-time <a href="computational%20fluid%20dynamics">computational fluid dynamics</a>. Aerobatic pilot <a href="Michael%20Goulian">Michael Goulian</a> endorsed the game and assisted the team in making it more true to life.

"Flight Unlimited" received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success; its sales exceeded 780,000 copies by 2002. Reviewers lauded its realism, flight instruction, graphics and sense of flight, but some criticized its high <a href="system%20requirements">system requirements</a>. The game was followed by two sequels: "<a href="Flight%20Unlimited%20II">Flight Unlimited II</a>" (1997) and "<a href="Flight%20Unlimited%20III">Flight Unlimited III</a>" (1999). A combat-oriented successor, "Flight Combat", was released in 2002 as "<a href="Jane%27s%20Attack%20Squadron">Jane's Attack Squadron</a>" after a series of setbacks. Soon after "Flight Unlimited"s completion, Blackley was fired from Looking Glass. He went on to design "" at <a href="DreamWorks%20Interactive">DreamWorks Interactive</a> and later spearhead the <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> project at <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>.

"Flight Unlimited" is a <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional</a> (3D) <a href="flight%20simulator">flight simulator</a> video game: its gameplay is a simulation of piloting real-world airplanes. Players may control the <a href="American%20Champion%20Decathlon">Bellanca Decathlon</a>, <a href="Extra%20EA-300">Extra 300S</a>, <a href="Pitts%20Special">Pitts Special S-2B</a>, <a href="Sukhoi%20Su-31">Sukhoi Su-31</a> and <a href="Grob%20G103a%20Twin%20II">Grob G103a Twin II</a> sailplane. The game begins at the <a href="Fixed-Base%20Operator">fixed-base operator</a> (FBO) interface—a traversable 3D room whose contents represent menu options. For example, the player interacts with a row of <a href="scale%20model">scale airplane models</a> to select an aircraft, and with a world globe to change airfield locations. Six settings are available, including <a href="Sedona%2C%20Arizona">Sedona, Arizona</a> and <a href="Springfield%2C%20Vermont">Springfield, Vermont</a>.

The player may choose to begin flight on a <a href="runway">runway</a> or <a href="taxiway">taxiway</a>, or in the air. Aircraft are controlled via <a href="Computer%20keyboard">keyboard</a>, <a href="joystick">joystick</a>, <a href="head-mounted%20display">head-mounted display</a> or specialized input devices such as <a href="Game%20controller%23Pedals">pedals</a>. During flight, several third- and first-person <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system">camera angles</a> may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places the camera in front of the plane as it flies past, while the first-person Three-Way View displays more information about the plane's position and speed than other angles. Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated <a href="flight%20instruments">flight instruments</a> such as an <a href="altimeter">altimeter</a>, <a href="airspeed%20indicator">airspeed indicator</a>, <a href="accelerometer">accelerometer</a>, <a href="variometer">variometer</a> and <a href="tachometer">tachometer</a>. The game is designed to allow players to perform <a href="aerobatic%20maneuver">aerobatic maneuver</a>s such as the <a href="Immelmann%20turn">Immelmann turn</a>, <a href="tailslide">tailslide</a>, <a href="Lomcevak">Lomcevak</a> and <a href="Cuban%20Eight">Cuban Eight</a>. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and <a href="fast%20forward">fast forward</a>. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.

The game contains lessons that cover basic and advanced flight techniques, ranging from <a href="rudder">rudder</a> turns to challenging aerobatic maneuvers. A simulated flight instructor offers real-time advice based on the player's performance. Certificates are earned by performing well during lessons. In Hoops courses, the player undertakes a <a href="time%20trial">time trial</a> through rings that float in the sky, with the option to enable a "<a href="Ghost%20%28video%20gaming%29">ghost plane</a>" of the highest score. Four types of Hoops courses are available: Basic, Challenge, Distance and Trick. The last is intended as a highly demanding test of the player's aerobatic ability. The game's sole non-powered aircraft, the Grob G103a Twin II sailplane, features its own game mode focused on energy management. The player attempts to use the direction of the wind, thermals—which realistically occur above areas that absorb more heat, such as plains and parking lots—and the <a href="orographic%20lift">orographic lift</a> caused by slopes to stay airborne for as long as possible.

The concept of "Flight Unlimited" originated from <a href="Looking%20Glass%20Studios">Looking Glass Technologies</a>' discontent with contemporary <a href="flight%20simulator">flight simulator</a>s. Company co-founders <a href="Paul%20Neurath">Paul Neurath</a> and <a href="Ned%20Lerner">Ned Lerner</a> wanted to develop an exceptional game in the genre, and Neurath considered the idea during the production of "" and "". In 1992, <a href="Seamus%20Blackley">Seamus Blackley</a>, who had been undertaking graduate studies in <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a> at the <a href="Fermilab">Fermilab</a> research facility, was hired through a <a href="classified%20advertising">want advertisement</a> that Lerner had placed on a bulletin board. At the company, Blackley programmed the physics modeling system for a racing game and designed a large number of standalone physics demonstrations. He became fascinated by physics programming. An amateur pilot and flight devotee, Blackley asked Lerner extensive questions about his earlier game "<a href="Chuck%20Yeager%27s%20Advanced%20Flight%20Trainer">Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer</a>", which Blackley held in high regard. In reaction to Blackley's enthusiasm, Neurath suggested that the company develop a "traditional <a href="List%20of%20Cessna%20models">Cessna</a> sim".

However, Blackley instead proposed an <a href="aerobatics">aerobatics</a> training simulation, which he had conceived while reading an aerobatics magazine on a <a href="Lexington%2C%20Massachusetts">Lexington, Massachusetts</a> bus. Collaborating with "Ultima Underworld II" programmer Greg Travis, he created a thirty page concept document that outlined the game. His core idea was to recreate the "yummy, visceral, fluid feeling that you get when flying a real airplane". He wanted the project to bear more resemblance to a <a href="playground">playground</a> than to a video game, and he sought to give it simple controls and realistic terrain to decrease the <a href="learning%20curve">learning curve</a> for beginners. Blackley assumed the role of project leader and then engaged the team in "flaming sessions" to generate ideas. According to programmer <a href="Doug%20Church">Doug Church</a>, Blackley's concept of the game was not fully developed, but he clearly expressed his thoughts and motivated the team. The first months of the project produced disparate prototypes that demonstrated prospective features. The company committed to full development of the game in early 1993, and production commenced in March.

Blackley's first objective was to code the game's simulated physics. He began by deciding on a programming method—in particular, he sought one that would allow aircraft to perform the "knife-edge spin" maneuver that he had witnessed at <a href="air%20show">air show</a>s. In 1995, he said that he had never played a flight simulator with an accurate sense of flight. He later described his belief that the genre had stagnated, and that flight games were evaluated "by [their] implementation of the standard feature set", rather than by their enjoyability. Blackley researched physics programming in contemporary flight simulators, and he discovered that many used large databases of <a href="wind%20tunnel">wind tunnel</a> and plane sensory equipment information to dictate how aircraft would operate in prerecorded scenarios. Higher-end simulators used a "<a href="Isaac%20Newton">Newtonian</a>" system, in which algebra-based measurements of <a href="Euclidean%20vector">force vectors</a> determine a plane's position in real-time. However, Blackley believed that neither system correctly simulated the experience of flight.

In reaction, he used his knowledge of particle physics to create a real-time <a href="computational%20fluid%20dynamics">computational fluid dynamics</a> (CFDs) model for "Flight Unlimited". The result is a simulated atmosphere: air acts as a fluid that automatically reacts to the shape of any object placed within it. Blackley gave the example that a <a href="garden%20furniture">lawn chair</a>, if placed within the game's real-time CFDs model, would fall merely because of its shape. The game's planes fly because the interaction of their architecture with the atmosphere creates <a href="Lift%20%28force%29">lift</a>, as with real-world aircraft. Changes in the plane's direction are caused by the interaction of their <a href="flight%20control%20surfaces">flight control surfaces</a> (<a href="aileron">aileron</a>s, <a href="elevator%20%28aircraft%29">elevator</a>s and rudders) with the simulated atmosphere. Because it simulates the dynamics of flight in real-time, the system allows for aerobatic maneuvers that were impossible in previous flight simulators. In 1994, Blackley said that it was possibly the first flight code designed for aerobatics. In constructing the CFDs model, Blackley and the team built from the <a href="Navier%E2%80%93Stokes%20equations">Navier–Stokes equations</a> of fluid motion, which Blackley described as "horrible, complicated <a href="partial%20differential%20equation">partial differential equation</a>s". According to "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>", Blackley did not seek to represent the equations with perfect accuracy, and he was satisfied when the results were consistent and the sensation that they generated was correct.

After programming a basic version of the CFDs model, Blackley used several programs to examine the simulated currents of air that flowed across a model of a flat plate. He adjusted the code until the plate fell realistically, and then constructed test models for a plane wing and <a href="fuselage">fuselage</a>. He eventually built a complete but dysfunctional plane by using data from "<a href="pseudoscience">pinhead</a> books". By reading aircraft design manuals, he discovered that the problems were caused by his plane's incorrect tail and <a href="Center%20of%20gravity%20of%20an%20aircraft">center of gravity</a>. Following this, he created an exact <a href="3D%20modeling">three-dimensional model</a> of the Extra 300S over roughly three days. As he had not yet simulated the physical attributes of its <a href="Propeller%20%28aircraft%29">propeller</a>, Blackley programmed the plane to be propelled from the rear. However, the accurate model performed properly in the simulated atmosphere.

Artists Mike Marsicano and Kurt Bickenbach played critical roles in the creation of the game's aircraft models, which were built in <a href="Autodesk%203ds%20Max">3D Studio</a>. As reference material, the team photographed real planes at several airfields, and they received <a href="blueprint">blueprint</a>s and <a href="datasheet">datasheet</a>s from aircraft manufacturers. The game's <a href="Grob%20G103a%20Twin%20II">Grob G103a Twin II</a> sailplane was based directly on the one that Blackley owned at the time. The sophistication of the real-time CFDs complicated the 3D modeling process, as the planes required accurate geometry to fly properly. While attempting to meet this goal, however, Bickenbach said that the models he created were overly detailed, which caused the team to struggle with performance issues related to the high number of <a href="polygonal%20modeling">polygons</a>. Reducing the number altered the plane's shape, which in turn reduced its flight realism; this necessitated a balance between performance and accuracy. To obtain audio for the planes, Greg LoPiccolo and Tom Streit—former bassist and road manager, respectively, of the band <a href="Tribe%20%28band%29">Tribe</a>—visited a Florida importer of Russian aerobatic aircraft. The two placed microphones inside the cockpits and next to the engines, and they flew each plane at multiple speeds while recording with a <a href="Digital%20Audio%20Tape">digital audio tape</a> machine. Combining this material with <a href="digital%20audio">digital recordings</a> of wind sounds, the team fashioned a physics-based sound system: sounds of the wind and engine are altered in real-time based on wind speed in the game.
The <a href="flight%20instructor">flight instructor</a> was created by programmer Andrew Grant and voiced by Tom Streit. It monitors the player's controller input during "each frame of animation". If a maneuver is attempted, the instructor "interpolates the initial control movements" and predicts which maneuver is being performed. The instructor then gives advice on how to complete the maneuver and offers guidance if a mistake is made. Grant believed that the code is sometimes "too picky", and he stated that it expects players to perform maneuvers more precisely than is humanly possible. The team initially planned to include an online <a href="multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> component, which would have allowed 64 planes to fly in the same area—thereby giving players the ability to compete with one another. However, the feature was not implemented into the final game. The staff members also sought to include aerobatic competitions in which the player could participate, but the idea was dropped because of difficulties with realism. Problems with <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificially intelligent</a> judges were also a factor in the feature's removal.

"Flight Unlimited"s terrain graphics were created with <a href="photogrammetry">stereophotogrammetry</a>. The team gathered <a href="aerial%20photography">aerial photographs</a> from locations in France and the United States. They combined two to three images of each area to create digital reproductions roughly in size. Each location in the game was based on two <a href="stereoscopy">stereoscopic</a> sets of photographs, which were processed for more than 72 hours by a "dedicated Pentium tucked away in a dark corner". From the contrasting images, the computer generated a terrain "data blanket" with 3D height variations. While the team had considered using satellite or <a href="surveillance%20aircraft">surveillance aircraft</a> images to create the game's terrain graphics, they found that the resolution was inadequate. Material from <a href="geographic%20information%20system">geographic information system</a>s was also studied, but associate producer Paul Schaffer said that it would have been "astronomically expensive" to obtain data with the necessary resolution.

After assembling a playable demo of "Flight Unlimited", the team requested assistance from then-US Aerobatic Team member <a href="Michael%20Goulian">Michael Goulian</a>, who worked as a flight instructor at the nearby <a href="Hanscom%20Field">Hanscom Field</a>. Because of the game's flight code, Goulian was able to execute aerobatic maneuvers within less than three minutes of playing the game; and he later performed his "entire basic aerobatic routine". Blackley told "<a href="PC%20Gamer%23PC%20Gamer%20US">PC Gamer US</a>" that, while Goulian disliked flight simulators, "When he flew "Flight Unlimited", he just said 'pretty cool.' I was so psyched". Goulian assisted the team during the next year of development: he co-designed the game's flight lessons and advised the team on adjustments to the plane models. Aerobatic pilot <a href="Patty%20Wagstaff">Patty Wagstaff</a> was also consulted. At one point, the team encountered problems while testing a maneuver in the game's <a href="Sukhoi%20Su-31">Sukhoi Su-31</a>, and Blackley was concerned that he would need to rework the game's physics code. However, Goulian phoned a colleague—a Russian pilot—who told them to compensate for the plane's abnormally large ailerons. Using his advice on flying the real-world plane, the team found that the maneuver worked correctly. Goulian endorsed "Flight Unlimited" and wrote the foreword to its official strategy guide.

The graphics and physics code increased the game's <a href="system%20requirements">system requirements</a>, and the team worked to optimize performance during development. They struggled to improve the game's memory usage: the process consumed nearly as much time as the creation of the physics model, according to Church. Programmer Eric Twietmeyer ran weekly tests of the game's performance by disabling certain parts of the code—such as the physics calculations—to isolate which parts used the most memory. By 1994, Blackley's physics code took up only 1% of <a href="CPU%20time">CPU time</a>, with the rest allocated to the terrain renderer. Blackley optimized his code by converting the mathematical calculations of air from the 3D game world into a "math-friendly space", during which time the Navier-Stokes equations are applied. Afterwards, the data is returned to 3D space. According to "Computer Gaming World", this method increased speed by "a factor of 100, with almost no loss in precision." The team had trouble with complex memory-related <a href="glitch">glitch</a>es during development. Church called them "crazy", and programmer Greg Travis noted that <a href="debugging">debugging</a> the terrain <a href="cache%20%28computing%29">cache</a> system was a "nightmare".

While leading the team, Blackley adopted a loose style of supervision. According to "Opening the Xbox" author Dean Takahashi, "Blackley [was not] ultra-organized. His idea of good management was to invite someone over for a gourmet dinner and have a casual conversation about work". However, Takahashi wrote that "Blackley worked hard to inspire his team", and he described artist James Dollar's belief that, "in contrast to other Looking Glass managers, he didn't take over tasks and make others feel stupid". During the first two years of production, the team was divided into small groups that worked on the game's elements separately. For example, Blackley programmed the game's physics, while Eric Twietmeyer and Tim Day created the terrain renderer. However, Doug Church later said that, while "the team [did] a bunch of very cool stuff, the FBO, the flight model, the instructor, the renderer, so on", the result "was almost like four separate programs, with no connection". Following the completion of the concurrently-developed "<a href="System%20Shock">System Shock</a>", a significant part of that game's team—including Church, <a href="Marc%20LeBlanc">Marc LeBlanc</a> and Rob Fermier—moved to "Flight Unlimited" to add connective material. At the time, Church said that it was difficult to meld the game's elements, but he later stated that they largely coalesced by the end.

"Flight Unlimited" was self-published by Looking Glass Technologies. Their previous games had been developed for other <a href="video%20game%20publisher">video game publisher</a>s, and had generated $90 million total earnings for those companies. However, Ronald Rosenberg of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" reported that Looking Glass was "no longer satisfied as a backroom player surviving on royalties". Doug Church later explained that the company wanted to self-publish in order to escape the "treadmill of waiting for advances", which would allow them to make long-term plans without needing to satisfy the immediate demands of a publisher. In late 1994, Looking Glass announced that <a href="venture%20capital">venture capital</a> investors, including <a href="Matrix%20Partners">Matrix Partners</a> and <a href="Institutional%20Venture%20Partners">Institutional Venture Partners</a>, had provided the company with $3.8 million. The sum was intended to fund the development and self-publication of "Flight Unlimited". According to Michael Humphreys of Matrix Partners and Ruthann Quindlen of Institutional Venture Partners, the decision was partly influenced by the past success of the company's co-founders, Paul Neurath and Ned Lerner.

Looking Glass intended "Flight Unlimited" as a gateway into the video game publishing industry. According to Lerner, the idea of self-publishing had been considered when the company was founded. In 1995, Looking Glass projected that sales of "Flight Unlimited" would increase royalty revenues to $10 million that year, up from $1.5 million in 1994. Jeffrey A. Kalowski, the company's vice president of finance and administration, expected that the game would recoup its development costs and make a return before the end of the year. He predicted that, over the following 12 to 18 months, the company's number of employees would increase from 52 to 82. The company's executive vice president and general manager, Jerry Wolosenko, told "The Boston Globe" that the company hoped to publish six games each year. According to Doug Church, the pressure for "Flight Unlimited" to succeed meant that the concurrently-developed "<a href="System%20Shock">System Shock</a>", which was not self-published, received little attention from the company's management.

"Flight Unlimited" was placed in direct competition with several major flight simulator franchises. Before the game's release, Shelby Bateman of "<a href="Next%20Generation%20Magazine">Next Generation Magazine</a>" wrote, "1995 is going to be a real dogfight in the flight-sim and aerial-combat categories, and LookingGlass is betting its bankroll ... that it can capture significant market share from the likes of Microsoft "Flight Simulator" and the debut of Spectrum HoloByte's "<a href="Falcon%204.0">Falcon 4.0</a>", among others." Describing the situation, Johnny L. Wilson of "Computer Gaming World" wrote, "The games that sell big are the ones that allow you to blow stuff up, so, if anything, that could be a problem for "Flight Unlimited"." Doug Church explained that, because the game did not feature combat and bore little resemblance to "Microsoft Flight Simulator", the team spent "many late nights" on marketing strategies. However, he noted that the game had a wide appeal among those who tested it during development, which he called "a really good sign". Talking to Bernie Yee of "<a href="PC%20Gamer%23PC%20Gamer%20US">PC Gamer US</a>", Paul Neurath said that he thought the game would sell well. Yee noted that Neurath "fully [expected] it to prove more popular than "Microsoft Flight Simulator"".

In January 1995, Looking Glass showed "Flight Unlimited" alongside "" at the Winter <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a>, under their "Immersive Reality" marketing label. In March 1995, the "Boston Globe" reported that the team was performing "11th hour checks" of the game to prepare it for shipment to a <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwestern United States</a> <a href="Compact%20Disc%20manufacturing">Compact Disc manufacturer</a>. According to the newspaper, Looking Glass planned to begin by shipping 100,000 units to retailers in <a href="Canada">Canada</a> and the United States. Another 100,000 copies were to be sent to <a href="France">France</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a> and the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> at a later date. However, upon the game's June 7, 1995 release for <a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>, 200,000 units were distributed simultaneously in the United States and Europe. The game's European releases were localized with German, French and English text and voice acting, which was made possible by "close coordination with international partners". Versions for <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> and <a href="Windows%2095">Windows 95</a> were later released; the former was shown at the <a href="Macworld">Macworld</a> Expo in April 1996.

"Flight Unlimited" was a commercial success. It debuted in twelfth place on a June 1995 sales chart compiled by <a href="NPD%20Group">NPD Group</a>, while "<a href="History%20of%20Microsoft%20Flight%20Simulator%23Flight%20Simulator%205.1">Microsoft Flight Simulator 5.1</a>" took first place. The game went on to sell more than 300,000 copies by 1997, and more than 780,000 by 2002. According to Constantine von Hoffman of the "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>", "Flight Unlimited" successfully competed with "Microsoft Flight Simulator". "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>"s Lee Buchanan wrote that it "soars above the pack of flight simulations", and he considered it to be "the most fun [he had] had in a computerized cockpit". Frank Vizard of "<a href="Popular%20Mechanics">Popular Mechanics</a>" hailed it as "the new top gun of flight simulators", and Doug Bailey of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" considered it to be the "first real serious challenge to Microsoft's dominance of the genre". "<a href="The%20Record%20%28Bergen%20County%29">The Record</a>"s David Noack believed that the game's physics and stereoscopic terrain set "a new standard in flight simulation". Writing for "Computer Gaming World", Bob and John Nolan stated, "If anything, you should at least take a look at this product, because you'll be looking at the future of simulations." 

The game was a finalist in the 12th Annual Awards for Technical Excellence held by "<a href="PC%20Magazine">PC Magazine</a>", whose staff called it "the simulator by which all others will be judged." It was named the best simulation of 1995 by "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Strategy Plus</a>" (tied with "<a href="Apache%20%28video%20game%29">Apache</a>"), and the best of 1996 by "<a href="Macworld">Macworld</a>", whose editor <a href="Steven%20Levy">Steven Levy</a> wrote that it "puts you in touch with what makes flying special." <a href="Inside%20Mac%20Games">Inside Mac Games</a> and "PC Gamer" both nominated "Flight Unlimited" as the simulation of the year, although it lost these awards to "<a href="A-10%20Cuba%21">A-10 Cuba!</a>" and "<a href="Apache%20%28video%20game%29">Apache</a>", respectively.

Vizard stated that "Flight Unlimited"s "very advanced computational fluid dynamics make [each] plane react according to spec". Buchanan lauded the fluid model for creating a "sensation of actual flight [that] is nothing short of magnificent", while "PC Magazine"s staff commented that it makes "planes behave more like real aircraft than any simulator we have seen". Bob and John Nolan called the game's physics programming "groundbreaking", and Chris Ware of the "<a href="Lexington%20Herald-Leader">Lexington Herald-Leader</a>" found the game to be the most accurate simulation of flight beyond "those multimillion-dollar flight simulators [used by] fighter pilots and astronauts". Noack agreed: he wrote that the game "is about as close to flying within going to the airport". In 1996, "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" presented "Flight Unlimited" with a Special Artistic Achievement Award For Physical Model. The magazine's staff praised Blackley's programming for pushing the genre "higher into the realm of simulation", and listed the game's sophisticated physics model as #5 on its list of "the 15 best ways to die in computer gaming".

Ware found "Flight Unlimited" approachable and noted its "simplicity of use and depth of instruction". Buchanan hailed the lesson mode as "a dream come true for any budding pilot". A writer for "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" called the game "[the] world's first truly easy-to-use flight simulator" and "a good entry product", in which "rank amateurs can just launch the program and start cruising immediately". "The Washington Post"s John Gaudiosi wrote that, while many games in the genre are overly complex, "Flight Unlimited" lets "those who aren't rocket scientists ... experience the thrills of stunt flying." He found its control scheme simple to understand. By contrast, Bailey found the game difficult and initially "frustrating": he complained that he had to play the lesson mode before even taking off. Denny Atkin of "Computer Gaming World" characterized the game's learning curve as steep, thanks to the accuracy of the physics programming, but he noted the scalable difficulty options. Bailey later recommended the game in a holiday shopping guide. He wrote that "it can be difficult to master. But once you're up, it's worth the trouble."

A writer for "The Washington Post" commented that "serious flight freaks will like the racing and advanced maneuvers". According to Gaudiosi, dedicated players will learn "all about aerodynamics and stunt flying"; he considered the latter to be "hard stuff, even with green hoops guiding you". Similarly, Buchanan characterized the Hoops courses as "incredibly demanding", and Atkin cited that mode's Trick <a href="Balance%20%28game%20design%29%23Difficulty%20level">difficulty level</a> as "amazingly tough". Bob and John Nolan wrote that people who "love to loop around the skies of "Flight Simulator 5" will go bananas for" the aerobatics; but the pair commented that <a href="combat%20flight%20simulator">combat flight simulator</a> players "might get a little edgy once the wow-power wears off." However, Atkin believed that only those "never happy without something to shoot at" could be disappointed by the lack of combat: other players will "be too busy choreographing aerial ballets, pulling off death-defying aerobatic stunts, or just enjoying a quiet soar down the ridge line to miss that stuff". Likewise, Ware called the non-violent gameplay "refreshing", and Buchanan wrote, "If [you are] a battle-weary veteran of air combat sims, "Flight Unlimited" might be just the sort of [rest and relaxation] you need."

Atkin found the cockpit and terrain graphics to look "almost real". He commented, "Every few years a sim comes along that lets reviewers use the 'sets new standards for graphics' cliché, and "Flight Unlimited" is the 1995 entry in this club." Bob and John Nolan called "Flight Unlimited" "the ultimate show off piece for your new Pentium", thanks to "unbelievable" graphics superior to those of any other computer game. Gaudiosi concurred: he characterized the visuals as "photo-sharp" and "better than any I have seen". "PC Magazine"s staff found the graphics "impressive" and "even more stunning than those in "Microsoft Flight Simulator"". Ware noted the "stunning 3-D photo-realistic scenery", while Bailey stated that the "graphics are brilliantly rendered and whiz by smoothly". Buchanan called "Flight Unlimited"s terrain "just superb" and Vizard described it as "amazingly real". Buchanan believed that "what you hear in "Flight Unlimited" is every bit as good as what you see", thanks to "utterly convincing" sound effects. Atkin praised the instructor as "one of the best uses of voice ever in a multimedia title".

Bailey wrote that the game needs "a real beefy machine" to run properly; Atkin stated that the "massive horsepower requirement will restrict many gamers to lower resolutions and detail levels". Bob and John Nolan similarly found that the game "hogs computing power". Buchanan wrote that the <a href="system%20requirements">system requirements</a> listed on the back of the game's box "must be a joke", and that a high-performance computer is necessary to run the game. In 1996, "PC Gamer US" presented the game with a "Special Achievement in Graphics" award. The editors wrote, "While it requires the most sophisticated computer hardware on the market to be enjoyed, "Flight Unlimited" rewards gamers with some of the most stunning scenery ever seen in a flight sim."

"Flight Unlimited" was the first of three self-published titles released by Looking Glass Technologies. However, the next two products, "" (1996) and "<a href="British%20Open%20Championship%20Golf">British Open Championship Golf</a>" (1997), were commercial failures. As a result, the company ceased self-publishing and was left in dire financial circumstances. Doug Church later explained that Looking Glass' attempt to publish came at a difficult time for the video game industry: "the other mid-sized publishers were mostly going out of business or getting bought". He believed that the company had been "overreaching itself" with the venture, and that it was "being a little overambitious and a little cocky".

"Flight Unlimited" was intended to be followed by a combat-oriented sequel, which was developed under the working title "Flight Combat". In 1995, Seamus Blackley told "PC Gamer US" that he wanted the game to "feel so real that pilots will be afraid. They'll "feel" the gun hits." Talking to "Computer Gaming World", he stated that the game would teach players the "same curriculum [as] the Air Force", and that it would feature competitive online play. However, a company manager, newly instated by venture capital investors who disliked Looking Glass' management style, instead demanded that Blackley create a direct sequel to "Flight Unlimited". The two argued regularly, and Blackley later accused the manager of "ripp[ing] the guts out of Looking Glass". In response to Blackley's refusal to create "Flight Unlimited II", the manager fired him. Blackley left the company in late 1995 with designer <a href="Austin%20Grossman">Austin Grossman</a>, and both were hired by <a href="DreamWorks%20Interactive">DreamWorks Interactive</a> to create "". He later spearheaded development of the <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> at <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>.

Constantine Hantzopoulos directed "<a href="Flight%20Unlimited%20II">Flight Unlimited II</a>", which was published by <a href="Eidos%20Interactive">Eidos Interactive</a> in 1997. The team could not continue using the real-time computational fluid dynamics of "Flight Unlimited" because, according to Hantzopoulos, it was "all black box <a href="spaghetti%20code">spaghetti code</a> from Seamus". The aerobatics focus of its predecessor was dropped in favor of general civilian aviation. The development of "Flight Combat" was hinted at during the production of "Flight Unlimited II". A third game, "<a href="Flight%20Unlimited%20III">Flight Unlimited III</a>", was published by <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a> in 1999; and it continued the focus on general aviation. That year, "Flight Combat" was officially announced as the <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>-themed, Electronic Arts-published "Flight Combat: Thunder Over Europe", but its name was eventually changed to "<a href="Jane%27s%20Attack%20Squadron">Jane's Attack Squadron</a>". The game was canceled as a consequence of Looking Glass Studios' closure in 2000. However, it was later finished by developer <a href="Mad%20Doc%20Software">Mad Doc Software</a> and released in 2002 by publisher <a href="Xicat%20Interactive">Xicat Interactive</a>.

Rufus Wilmot Griswold

Rufus Wilmot Griswold (February 13, 1815 – August 27, 1857) was an American <a href="anthology">anthologist</a>, editor, poet, and critic. Born in <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a>, Griswold left home when he was 15 years old. He worked as a journalist, editor, and critic in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, New York City, and elsewhere. He built up a strong literary reputation, in part due to his 1842 collection "<a href="The%20Poets%20and%20Poetry%20of%20America">The Poets and Poetry of America</a>". This anthology, the most comprehensive of its time, included what he deemed the best examples of <a href="poetry%20of%20the%20United%20States">American poetry</a>. He produced revised versions and similar anthologies for the remainder of his life, although many of the poets he promoted have since faded into obscurity. Many writers hoped to have their work included in one of these editions, although they commented harshly on Griswold's abrasive character. Griswold was married three times: his first wife died young, his second marriage ended in a public and controversial divorce, and his third wife left him after the previous divorce was almost repealed.

<a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, whose poetry had been included in Griswold's anthology, published a critical response that questioned which poets were included. This began a rivalry which grew when Griswold succeeded Poe as editor of "<a href="Graham%27s%20Magazine">Graham's Magazine</a>" at a higher salary than Poe's. Later, the two competed for the attention of poet <a href="Frances%20Sargent%20Osgood">Frances Sargent Osgood</a>. They never reconciled their differences and, after <a href="death%20of%20Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Poe's mysterious death</a> in 1849, Griswold wrote an unsympathetic obituary. Claiming to be Poe's chosen <a href="literary%20executor">literary executor</a>, he began a campaign to harm Poe's reputation that lasted until his own death eight years later.

Griswold considered himself an expert in American poetry and was an early proponent of its inclusion on the school curriculum. He also supported the introduction of <a href="copyright">copyright</a> legislation, speaking to Congress on behalf of the publishing industry, although he was not above <a href="Copyright%20infringement">infringing</a> the copyright of other people's work. A fellow editor remarked, "even while haranguing the loudest, [he] is purloining the fastest".

Griswold was born to Rufus and Deborah (Wass) Griswold on February 13, 1815, in <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a>, near <a href="Rutland%20%28city%29%2C%20Vermont">Rutland</a>, and raised a strict <a href="Calvinism">Calvinist</a> in the hamlet of <a href="Benson%2C%20Vermont">Benson</a>. He was the twelfth of fourteen children and his father was a farmer and shoemaker. In 1822, the family sold the Benson farm and moved to nearby <a href="Hubbardton%2C%20Vermont">Hubbardton</a>. As a child, Griswold was complex, unpredictable, and reckless. He left home when he was 15, calling himself a "solitary soul, wandering through the world, a homeless, joyless outcast".

Griswold moved to <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany, New York</a>, to live with a 22-year-old flute-playing journalist named George C. Foster, a writer best known for his work "New-York by Gas-Light". Griswold lived with Foster until he was 17, and the two may have had a romantic relationship. When Griswold moved away, Foster wrote to him begging him to return, signing his letter "come to me if you love me". Griswold attempted to enroll at the <a href="Rensselaer%20Polytechnic%20Institute">Rensselaer School</a> in 1830, but was not allowed to take any classes after he was caught attempting to play a prank on a professor.

After a brief spell as a printer's <a href="apprenticeship">apprentice</a>, Griswold moved to <a href="Syracuse%2C%20New%20York">Syracuse</a> where, with some friends, he started a newspaper called "The Porcupine". This publication purposefully targeted locals for what was later remembered as merely malicious critique.

He moved to New York City in 1836 and, in March of that year, was introduced to 19-year-old Caroline Searles, whom he later married. He was employed as an editor for various publications in the New York area. In October, he considered running for office as a <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig</a> but did not receive the party's support. In 1837 he was licensed as a <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> clergyman, although he never had a permanent congregation.

Griswold married Caroline on August 12, 1837, and the couple had two daughters. Following the birth of their second daughter, Griswold left his family behind in New York and moved to Philadelphia. His departure on November 27, 1840, was by all accounts abrupt, leaving his job with <a href="Horace%20Greeley">Horace Greeley</a>'s "<a href="New%20York%20Tribune">New York Tribune</a>", and his library of several thousand volumes. He joined the staff of Philadelphia's "Daily Standard" and began to build his reputation as a literary critic, becoming known for his savagery and vindictiveness.

On November 6, 1842, Griswold visited his wife in New York after she had given birth to their third child, a son. Three days later, after returning to Philadelphia, he was informed that both she and the infant had died. Deeply shocked, Griswold traveled by train alongside her coffin, refusing to leave her side for 30 hours. When fellow passengers urged him to try to sleep, he answered by kissing her dead lips and embracing her, his two children crying next to him. He refused to leave the cemetery after her funeral, even after the other mourners had left, until forced to do so by a relative. He wrote a long poem in blank verse dedicated to Caroline, "Five Days", which was printed in the "New York Tribune" on November 16, 1842. Griswold had difficulty believing she had died and often dreamed of their reunion. Forty days after her entombment, he entered her <a href="Burial%20vault%20%28tomb%29">vault</a>, cut off a lock of her hair, kissed her on the forehead and lips, and wept for several hours, staying by her side until a friend found him 30 hours later.

In 1842, Griswold released his 476-page anthology of <a href="Poetry%20of%20the%20United%20States">American poetry</a>, "The Poets and Poetry of America", which he dedicated to <a href="Washington%20Allston">Washington Allston</a>. Griswold's collection featured poems from over 80 authors, including 17 by <a href="Lydia%20Sigourney">Lydia Sigourney</a>, three by Edgar Allan Poe, and 45 by <a href="Charles%20Fenno%20Hoffman">Charles Fenno Hoffman</a>. Hoffman, a close friend, was allotted twice as much space as any other author. Griswold went on to oversee many other anthologies, including "Biographical Annual", which collected memoirs of "eminent persons recently deceased", "Gems from American Female Poets", "Prose Writers of America", and "Female Poets of America".

Between 1842 and 1845 while Griswold was collecting material for "Prose Writers of America" he discovered the identity of <a href="Horace%20Binney%20Wallace">Horace Binney Wallace</a>, who had been writing in various literary magazines at the time (including <a href="Burton%27s%20Magazine">Burton's</a>) under the pen name William Landor. Wallace declined to be included in the anthology but the two became friends, exchanging many letters over the years. Wallace eventually ghostwrote Griswold's "Napoleon and the Marshals of the Empire" (1847).

"Prose Writers of America", published in 1847, was prepared specifically to compete with a similar anthology by <a href="Cornelius%20Mathews">Cornelius Mathews</a> and <a href="Evert%20Augustus%20Duyckinck">Evert Augustus Duyckinck</a>. The prose collection earned Griswold a rivalry with the two men, which Griswold expected. As it was being published, Griswold wrote to Boston publisher <a href="James%20Thomas%20Fields">James Thomas Fields</a> that "<a href="Young%20America%20movement">Young America</a> will be rabid". In preparing his anthologies, Griswold would write to the living authors whose work he was including to ask their suggestions on which poems to include, as well as to gather information for a biographical sketch.

In 1843 Griswold founded <a href="The%20Opal%20%28annual%29">"The Opal"</a>, an annual <a href="gift%20book">gift book</a> that collected essays, stories, and poetry. <a href="Nathaniel%20Parker%20Willis">Nathaniel Parker Willis</a> edited its first edition, which was released in the fall of 1844. For a time, Griswold was editor of the "<a href="Saturday%20Evening%20Post">Saturday Evening Post</a>" and also published a collection of poetry, "The Cypress Wreath" (1844). His poems, with titles such as "The Happy Hour of Death", "On the Death of a Young Girl", and "The Slumber of Death", emphasized mortality and <a href="mourning">mourning</a>. Another collection of his poetry, "Christian Ballads and Other Poems", was published in 1844, and his nonfiction book, "The Republican Court or, American Society in the Days of Washington", was published in 1854. The book is meant to cover events during the presidency of <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>, though it mixes historical fact with apocryphal legend until one is indistinguishable from the other. During this period, Griswold occasionally offered his services at the pulpit delivering sermons and he may have received an <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary doctorate</a> from <a href="Shurtleff%20College">Shurtleff College</a>, a Baptist institution in Illinois, leading to his nickname the "Reverend Dr. Griswold".

On August 20, 1845, Griswold married Charlotte Myers, a Jewish woman; she was 42 and he was 33. Griswold had been pressured into the marriage by the woman's aunts, despite his concern about their difference in religious beliefs. This difference was strong enough that one of Griswold's friends referred to his wife only as "the little Jewess". On their wedding night, he discovered that she was, according to Griswold biographer Joy Bayless, "through some physical misfortune, incapable of being a wife" or, as Poe biographer <a href="Kenneth%20Silverman">Kenneth Silverman</a> explains, incapable of having sex. Griswold considered the marriage void and no more valid "than there would have been had the ceremony taken place between parties of the same sex, or where the sex of one was doubtful or ambiguous". Still, the couple moved together to <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>, Charlotte's home town, and lived under the same roof, albeit sleeping in separate rooms. Neither of the two was happy with the situation, and at the end of April 1846 she had a lawyer write up a contract "to separate, altogether and forever, ... which would in effect be a divorce". The contract forbade Griswold from remarrying and paid him $1,000 for expenses in exchange for his daughter Caroline staying with the Myers family. After this separation, Griswold immediately moved back to Philadelphia.

A few years later, Griswold moved back to New York City, leaving his younger daughter in the care of the Myers family and his elder daughter, Emily, with relatives on her mother's side. He had by now earned the nickname "Grand Turk", and in the summer of 1847 made plans to edit an anthology of poetry by American women. He believed that women were incapable of the same kind of "intellectual" poetry as men and believed they needed to be divided: "The conditions of aesthetic ability in the two sexes are probably distinct, or even opposite", he wrote in his introduction. The selections he chose for "The Female Poets of America" were not necessarily the greatest examples of poetry but instead were chosen because they emphasized traditional morality and values. That same year, Griswold began working on what he considered "the "maximum opus" of his life", an extensive biographical dictionary. Although he worked on it for several years and even advertised for it, it was never produced. He also helped <a href="Elizabeth%20F.%20Ellet">Elizabeth F. Ellet</a> publish her book "Women of the American Revolution", and was angered when she did not acknowledge his assistance in the book. In July 1848, he visited poet <a href="Sarah%20Helen%20Whitman">Sarah Helen Whitman</a> in <a href="Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Providence, Rhode Island</a>, although he had been suffering with <a href="vertigo%20%28medical%29">vertigo</a> and exhaustion, rarely leaving his apartment at <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>, and was unable to write without taking <a href="opium">opium</a>. In autumn of that year, he had an <a href="epilepsy">epileptic fit</a>, the first of many he would suffer for the remainder of his life. One fit caused him to fall out of a ferry in Brooklyn and nearly drown. He wrote to publisher James T. Fields: "I am in a terrible condition, physically and mentally. I do not know what the end will be ... I am exhausted—betwixt life and death—and heaven and hell." In 1849, he was further troubled when Charles Fenno Hoffman, with whom he had become good friends, was committed to an insane asylum.

Griswold continued editing and contributing literary criticism for various publications, both full-time and freelance, including 22 months from July 1, 1850, to April 1, 1852, with "The International Magazine". There, he worked with contributors including <a href="Elizabeth%20Oakes%20Smith">Elizabeth Oakes Smith</a>, <a href="Mary%20E.%20Hewitt">Mary E. Hewitt</a> and <a href="John%20R.%20Thompson">John R. Thompson</a>. In the November 10, 1855, issue of "The Criterion", Griswold anonymously reviewed the first edition of <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>'s "<a href="Leaves%20of%20Grass">Leaves of Grass</a>", declaring: "It is impossible to image how any man's fancy could have conceived such a mass of stupid filth". Griswold charged that Whitman was guilty of "the vilest imaginings and shamefullest license", a "degrading, beastly sensuality." Referring to Whitman's poetry, Griswold said he left "this gathering of muck to the laws which ... must have the power to suppress such gross obscenity." Whitman later included Griswold's review in a new edition of "Leaves of Grass". He ended his review with a phrase in Latin referring to "that horrible sin, among Christians not to be named", the stock phrase long associated with Christian condemnations of sodomy. Griswold was the first person in the 19th century to publicly point to and stress the theme of erotic desire and acts between men in Whitman's poetry. More attention to that aspect of Whitman's poetry would only surface late in the 19th century.

After a brief flirtation with poet <a href="Alice%20Cary">Alice Cary</a>, Griswold pursued a relationship with Harriet McCrillis. He originally did not want to divorce Charlotte Myers because he "dreaded the publicity" and because of her love for his daughter. He applied for divorce at the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia on March 25, 1852. Elizabeth Ellet and <a href="Ann%20S.%20Stephens">Ann S. Stephens</a> wrote to Myers urging her not to grant the divorce, and to McCrillis not to marry him. To convince Myers to agree to the divorce, Griswold allowed her to keep his daughter Caroline if she signed a statement that she had deserted him. She agreed and the divorce was made official December 18; he likely never saw Myers or his daughter again. McCrillis and Griswold were married shortly thereafter on December 26, 1852, and settled at 196 West Twenty-third Street in New York. Their son, William, was born on October 9, 1853.

Ellet and Stephens continued writing to Griswold's ex-wife, urging her to have the divorce repealed. Myers was finally convinced and filed in Philadelphia on September 23, 1853. The court, however, had lost records of the divorce and had to delay the appeal. Adding to Griswold's troubles, that fall, a gas leak in his home caused an explosion and a fire. He was severely burned, losing his eyelashes, eyebrows, and seven of his finger nails. That same year, his 15-year-old daughter, Emily, nearly died in Connecticut. <a href="Norwalk%20rail%20accident">A train</a> she was riding on had fallen off a drawbridge into a river. When Griswold arrived he saw 49 corpses in a makeshift morgue. Emily had been pronounced dead when pinned underwater but a doctor was able to revive her. On February 24, 1856, the divorce appeal went to court, with Ellet and Stephens providing lengthy testimony against Griswold's character. Neither Griswold nor Myers attended and the appeal was dismissed. Embarrassed by the ordeal, McCrillis left Griswold in New York and moved in with family in <a href="Bangor%2C%20Maine">Bangor, Maine</a>.

Griswold died of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> in New York City on August 27, 1857. Sarah Anna Lewis, a friend and writer, suggested that the interference of Elizabeth Ellet had exacerbated Griswold's condition and that she "goaded Griswold to his death". At the time of his death, the sole decorations found in his room were portraits of himself, Frances Osgood, and Poe. A friend, <a href="Charles%20Godfrey%20Leland">Charles Godfrey Leland</a>, found in Griswold's desk several documents attacking a number of authors which Griswold was preparing for publication. Leland decided to burn them.

Griswold's funeral was held on August 30. His <a href="pallbearer">pallbearer</a>s included Leland, <a href="Charles%20Frederick%20Briggs">Charles Frederick Briggs</a>, <a href="George%20Henry%20Moore%20%28author%29">George Henry Moore</a>, and <a href="Richard%20Henry%20Stoddard">Richard Henry Stoddard</a>. His remains were left for eight years in the receiving tomb of <a href="Green-Wood%20Cemetery">Green-Wood Cemetery</a> before being buried on July 12, 1865, without a headstone. Although his library of several thousand volumes was auctioned off, raising over $3,000 to be put towards a monument, none was ever commissioned.

Griswold's anthology "The Poets and Poetry of America" was the most comprehensive of its kind to date. As critic <a href="Lewis%20Gaylord%20Clark">Lewis Gaylord Clark</a> said, it was expected Griswold's book would "become incorporated into the permanent undying literature of our age and nation". The anthology helped Griswold build up a considerable reputation throughout the 1840s and 1850s and its first edition went through three printings in only six months. His choice of authors, however, was occasionally questioned. A British editor reviewed the collection and concluded, "with two or three exceptions, there is not a poet of mark in the whole Union" and referred to the anthology as "the most conspicuous act of martyrdom yet committed in the service of the transatlantic muses". Even so, the book was popular and was even continued in several editions after Griswold's death by Richard Henry Stoddard.

In more modern times, "The Poets and Poetry of America" has been nicknamed a "graveyard of poets" because its anthologized writers have since passed into obscurity to become, as literary historian Fred Lewis Pattee wrote, "dead ... beyond all resurrection". Pattee also called the book a "collection of poetic trash" and "voluminous worthlessness".

Within the contemporary American literary scene Griswold became known as erratic, dogmatic, pretentious, and vindictive. As historian <a href="Perry%20Miller">Perry Miller</a> wrote, "Griswold was about as devious as they came in this era of deviousness; did not ample documentation prove that he actually existed, we might suppose him ... one of the less plausible inventions of <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>". Later anthologies such as "Prose Writers of America" and "Female Poets of America" helped him become known as a literary dictator, whose approval writers sought even while they feared his growing power. Even as they tried to impress him, however, several authors voiced their opinion on Griswold's character. Ann S. Stephens called him two-faced and "constitutionally incapable of speaking the truth". Even his friends knew him as a consummate liar and had a saying: "Is that a Griswold or a fact?" Another friend once called him "one of the most irritable and vindictive men I ever met". Author <a href="Cornelius%20Mathews">Cornelius Mathews</a> wrote in 1847 that Griswold fished for writers to exploit, warning "the poor little innocent fishes" to avoid his "Griswold Hook". A review of one of Griswold's anthologies, published anonymously in the Philadelphia "Saturday Museum" on January 28, 1843, but believed to have been written by Poe, asked: "What will be [Griswold's] fate? Forgotten, save only by those whom he has injured and insulted, he will sink into oblivion, without leaving a landmark to tell that he once existed; or if he is spoken of hereafter, he will be quoted as the unfaithful servant who abused his trust."

<a href="James%20Russell%20Lowell">James Russell Lowell</a>, who had privately called Griswold "an ass and, what's more, a knave", composed a verse on Griswold's temperament in his satirical "<a href="A%20Fable%20for%20Critics">A Fable for Critics</a>":

Griswold was one of the earliest proponents of teaching schoolchildren American poetry in addition to English poetry. One of his anthologies, "Readings in American Poetry for the Use of Schools", was created specifically for that purpose. His knowledge in American poetry was emphasized by his claim that he had read every American poem published before 1850—an estimated 500 volumes. "He has more literary patriotism, if the phrase be allowable ... than any person we ever knew", wrote a contributor to "Graham's". "Since the Pilgrims landed, no man or woman has written anything on any subject which has escaped his untiring research." <a href="Oliver%20Wendell%20Holmes%2C%20Sr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.</a> noted that Griswold researched literature like "a kind of naturalist whose subjects are authors, whose memory is a perfect fauna of all flying and creeping things that feed on ink."

<a href="Evert%20Augustus%20Duyckinck">Evert Augustus Duyckinck</a> commented that "the thought [of a national literature] seems to have entered and taken possession of [Griswold's] mind with the force of <a href="monomania">monomania</a>". Poet <a href="Philip%20Pendleton%20Cooke">Philip Pendleton Cooke</a> questioned Griswold's sincerity, saying he "should have loved [it] ... better than to say it". By the 1850s, Griswold's literary nationalism had subsided somewhat, and he began following the more popular contemporary trend of reading literature from England, France, and Germany. He disassociated himself from the "absurd notion ... that we are to create an entirely new literature".

Publicly, Griswold supported the establishment of international copyright, although he himself often duplicated entire works during his time as an editor, particularly with "The Brother Jonathan." A contemporary editor said of him, "He takes advantage of a state of things which he declares to be 'immoral, unjust and wicked,' and even while <a href="wikt%3Aharangue">haranguing</a> the loudest, is <a href="wikt%3Apurloin">purloining</a> the fastest." Even so, he was chosen to represent the publishing industry before Congress in the spring of 1844 to discuss the need for copyright law.

Griswold first met <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> in May 1841 while working for the "Daily Standard". At the outset, their relationship was cordial, at least superficially. In a letter dated March 29, 1841, Poe sent Griswold several poems for "The Poets and Poetry of America" anthology, writing that he would be proud to see "one or two of them in the book". Griswold included three of these poems: "Coliseum", "<a href="The%20Haunted%20Palace%20%28poem%29">The Haunted Palace</a>", and "The Sleeper". In November of that year, Poe, who had previously praised Griswold in his "Autography" series as "a gentleman of fine taste and sound judgment", wrote a critical review of the anthology, on Griswold's behalf. Griswold paid Poe for the review and used his influence to have it published in a <a href="Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Boston</a> periodical. The review was generally favorable, although Poe questioned the inclusion of certain authors and the omission of others. Poe also said that Griswold "unduly favored" <a href="New%20England">New England</a> writers. Griswold had expected more praise and Poe privately told others he was not particularly impressed by the book, even calling it "a most outrageous <a href="humbug">humbug</a>" in a letter to a friend. In another letter, this time to fellow writer Frederick W. Thomas, Poe suggested that Griswold's promise to help get the review published was actually a bribe for a favorable review, knowing Poe needed the money.

Making the relationship even more strained, only months later, Griswold was hired by <a href="George%20Rex%20Graham">George Rex Graham</a> to take up Poe's former position as editor of "Graham's Magazine". Griswold, however, was paid more and given more editorial control of the magazine than Poe. Shortly after, Poe began presenting a series of lectures called "The Poets and Poetry of America", the first of which was given in Philadelphia on November 25, 1843. Poe openly attacked Griswold in front of his large audience and continued to do so in similar lectures. Graham said that during these lectures, Poe "gave Mr. Griswold some raps over the knuckles of force sufficient to be remembered". In a letter dated January 16, 1845, Poe tried to reconcile with Griswold, promising him that his lecture now omitted all that Griswold found objectionable.

Another source of animosity between the two men was their competition for the attention of the poet <a href="Frances%20Sargent%20Osgood">Frances Sargent Osgood</a> in the mid to late 1840s. While both she and Poe were still married to their respective spouses, the two carried on a public flirtation that resulted in much gossip among the literati. Griswold, who was smitten with Osgood, escorted her to literary salons and became her staunchest defender. "She is in all things the most admirable woman I ever knew", he wrote to publisher James T. Fields in 1848. Osgood responded by dedicating a collection of her poetry to Griswold, "as a souvenir of admiration for his genius, of regard for his generous character, and of gratitude for his valuable literary counsels".

After <a href="Death%20of%20Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Poe's death</a>, Griswold prepared an obituary signed with the pseudonym "Ludwig". First printed in the October 9, 1849, issue of the "New York Tribune", it was soon republished many times. Here he asserted that "few will be grieved" by Poe's death as he had few friends. He claimed that Poe often wandered the streets, either in "madness or melancholy", mumbling and cursing to himself, was easily irritated, was envious of others, and that he "regarded society as composed of villains". Poe's drive to succeed, Griswold wrote, was because he sought "the right to despise a world which galled his self-conceit". Much of this characterization of Poe was copied almost verbatim from that of the fictitious Francis Vivian in "<a href="The%20Caxtons">The Caxtons</a>" by <a href="Edward%20Bulwer-Lytton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Lytton">Edward Bulwer-Lytton</a>.

Griswold biographer Joy Bayless wrote that Griswold used a pseudonym not to conceal his relationship to the obituary but because it was his custom never to sign his newspaper and his magazine contributions. Regardless, Griswold's true identity was soon revealed. In a letter to <a href="Sarah%20Helen%20Whitman">Sarah Helen Whitman</a> dated December 17, 1849, he admitted his role in writing Poe's death notice. "I was not his friend, nor was he mine", he wrote.

Griswold claimed that "among the last requests of Mr. Poe" was that he become his <a href="literary%20executor">literary executor</a> "for the benefit of his family". Griswold claimed that Poe's aunt and mother-in-law Maria Clemm said Poe had made such a statement on June 9, 1849, and that she herself released any claim to Poe's works. And indeed a document exists in which Clemm transfers <a href="power%20of%20attorney">power of attorney</a> to Griswold, dated October 20, 1849, although there are no signed witnesses. Clemm, however, had no right to make such a decision; Poe's younger sister Rosalie was his closest next of kin. Although Griswold had acted as a literary agent for other American writers, it is unclear if Poe really appointed Griswold his executor (perhaps as part of his "<a href="The%20Imp%20of%20the%20Perverse">Imp of the Perverse</a>"), if it were a trick on Griswold's part, or a mistake on Maria Clemm's. It is also possible that Osgood persuaded Poe to name Griswold as his executor.

In any case, Griswold, along with James Russell Lowell and <a href="Nathaniel%20Parker%20Willis">Nathaniel Parker Willis</a>, edited a posthumous collection of Poe's works published in three volumes starting in January 1850. He did not share the profits of his edition with Poe's surviving relatives. This edition included a biographical sketch titled "Memoir of the Author" which has become notorious for its inaccuracy. The "Memoir" depicts Poe as a madman, addicted to drugs and chronically drunk. Many elements were fabricated by Griswold using forged letters as evidence and it was denounced by those who knew Poe, including <a href="Sarah%20Helen%20Whitman">Sarah Helen Whitman</a>, <a href="Charles%20Frederick%20Briggs">Charles Frederick Briggs</a>, and George Rex Graham. In March, Graham published a notice in his magazine accusing Griswold of betraying trust and taking revenge on the dead. "Mr. Griswold", he wrote, "has allowed old prejudices and old enmities to steal ... into the coloring of his picture." <a href="Thomas%20Holley%20Chivers">Thomas Holley Chivers</a> wrote a book called "New Life of Edgar Allan Poe" which directly responded to Griswold's accusations. He said that Griswold "is not only incompetent to Edit any of [Poe's] works, but totally unconscious of the duties which he and every man who sets himself up as a Literary Executor, owe the dead".

Today Griswold's name is usually associated with Poe's as a <a href="character%20assassination">character assassin</a>, although not all believe that Griswold deliberately intended to cause harm. Some of the information that Griswold asserted or implied was that Poe was expelled from the <a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a> and that Poe had tried to seduce his guardian John Allan's second wife. Even so, Griswold's attempts only drew attention to Poe's work; readers were thrilled at the idea of reading the works of an "evil" man. Griswold's characterization of Poe and the false information he originated appeared consistently in Poe biographies for the next two decades.

Nathaniel Parker Willis

Nathaniel Parker Willis (January 20, 1806 – January 20, 1867), also known as N. P. Willis, was an American author, poet and editor who worked with several notable American writers including <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> and <a href="Henry%20Wadsworth%20Longfellow">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>. He became the highest-paid magazine writer of his day. For a time, he was the employer of former slave and future writer <a href="Harriet%20Jacobs">Harriet Jacobs</a>. His brother was the composer <a href="Richard%20Storrs%20Willis">Richard Storrs Willis</a> and his sister Sara wrote under the name <a href="Fanny%20Fern">Fanny Fern</a>.

Born in <a href="Portland%2C%20Maine">Portland</a>, <a href="Maine">Maine</a>, Willis came from a family of publishers. His grandfather <a href="Nathaniel%20Willis%20%281755%E2%80%931831%29">Nathaniel Willis</a> owned newspapers in Massachusetts and Virginia, and his father <a href="Nathaniel%20Willis%20%281780%E2%80%931870%29">Nathaniel Willis</a> was the founder of "<a href="Youth%27s%20Companion">Youth's Companion</a>", the first newspaper specifically for children. Willis developed an interest in literature while attending <a href="Yale%20College">Yale College</a> and began publishing poetry. After graduation, he worked as an overseas correspondent for the "<a href="New%20York%20Mirror">New York Mirror</a>". He eventually moved to New York and began to build his literary reputation. Working with multiple publications, he was earning about $100 per article and between $5,000 and $10,000 per year. In 1846, he started his own publication, the "Home Journal", which was eventually renamed "<a href="Town%20%26amp%3B%20Country%20%28magazine%29">Town & Country</a>". Shortly after, Willis moved to a home on the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a> where he lived a semi-retired life until his death in 1867.

Willis embedded his own personality into his writing and addressed his readers personally, specifically in his <a href="travel%20writing">travel writing</a>s, so that his reputation was built in part because of his character. Critics, including his sister in her novel "<a href="Ruth%20Hall%20%28novel%29">Ruth Hall</a>", occasionally described him as being effeminate and Europeanized. Willis also published several poems, tales, and a play. Despite his intense popularity for a time, at his death Willis was nearly forgotten.

Nathaniel Parker Willis was born on January 20, 1806, in Portland, Maine. His father Nathaniel Willis was a newspaper proprietor there and his grandfather owned newspapers in Boston, Massachusetts and western Virginia. His mother was Hannah Willis ("née" Parker) from <a href="Holliston%2C%20Massachusetts">Holliston, Massachusetts</a> and it was her husband's offer to edit the "Eastern Argus" in Maine that caused their move to Portland. Willis's younger sister was Sara Willis Parton, who would later become a writer under the pseudonym <a href="Fanny%20Fern">Fanny Fern</a>. His brother, <a href="Richard%20Storrs%20Willis">Richard Storrs Willis</a>, became a musician and music journalist known for writing the melody for "<a href="It%20Came%20Upon%20the%20Midnight%20Clear">It Came Upon the Midnight Clear</a>". His other siblings were Lucy Douglas (born 1804), Louisa Harris (1807), Julia Dean (1809), Mary Perry (1813), Edward Payson (1816), and Ellen Holmes (1821).

In 1816, the family moved to Boston, where Willis's father established the "Boston Recorder" and, nine years later, the "<a href="Youth%27s%20Companion">Youth's Companion</a>", the world's first newspaper for children. The elder Willis's emphasis on religious themes earned him the nickname "Deacon" Willis. After attending a Boston grammar school and <a href="Phillips%20Academy">Phillips Academy</a> at <a href="Andover%2C%20Massachusetts">Andover</a>, Nathaniel Parker Willis entered <a href="Yale%20College">Yale College</a> in October 1823 where he roomed with <a href="Horace%20Bushnell">Horace Bushnell</a>. Willis credited Bushnell with teaching him the proper technique for sharpening a razor by "drawing it from heel to point both ways ... the two cross frictions correct each other". At Yale, he further developed an interest in literature, often neglecting his other studies. He graduated in 1827 and spent time touring parts of the United States and Canada. In <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, he met <a href="Chester%20Harding%20%28painter%29">Chester Harding</a>, with whom he would become a lifelong friend. Years later, Harding referred to Willis during this period as "the 'lion' of the town". Willis began publishing poetry in his father's "Boston Periodical", often using one of two literary personalities under the pen names "Roy" (for religious subjects) and "Cassius" (for more secular topics). The same year, Willis published a volume of poetical "Sketches".

In the latter part of the 1820s, Willis began contributing more frequently to magazines and periodicals. In 1829, he served as editor for the <a href="gift%20book">gift book</a> "<a href="The%20Token%20and%20Atlantic%20Souvenir">The Token</a>", making him the only person to be editor in the book's 15-year history besides its founder, <a href="Samuel%20Griswold%20Goodrich">Samuel Griswold Goodrich</a>. That year, Willis founded the "American Monthly Magazine", which began publishing in April 1829 until it was discontinued in August 1831. He blamed its failure on the "tight purses of Boston culture" and moved to Europe to serve as foreign editor and correspondent of the "<a href="New%20York%20Mirror">New York Mirror</a>". In 1832, while in <a href="Florence%2C%20Italy">Florence, Italy</a>, he met <a href="Horatio%20Greenough">Horatio Greenough</a>, who sculpted a bust of the writer. Between 1832 and 1836, Willis contributed a series of letters for the "Mirror", about half of which were later collected as "Pencillings by the Way", printed in London in 1835. The romantic descriptions of scenes and modes of life in Europe sold well despite the then high price tag of $7 a copy. The work became popular and boosted Willis's literary reputation enough that an American edition was soon issued.

Despite this popularity, he was censured by some critics for indiscretion in reporting private conversations. At one point he fought a bloodless duel with Captain <a href="Frederick%20Marryat">Frederick Marryat</a>, then editor of the "Metropolitan Magazine", after Willis sent a private letter of Marryat's to <a href="George%20Pope%20Morris">George Pope Morris</a>, who had it printed. Still, in 1835 Willis was popular enough to introduce <a href="Henry%20Wadsworth%20Longfellow">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a> to important literary figures in England, including <a href="Ada%20Lovelace">Ada Byron</a>, daughter of <a href="George%20Gordon%20Byron%2C%206th%20Baron%20Byron">Lord Byron</a>.

While abroad, Willis wrote to a friend, "I should like to marry in England". He soon married Mary Stace, daughter of General William Stace of <a href="Woolwich">Woolwich</a>, on October 1, 1835, after a month-long engagement. The couple took a two-week honeymoon in Paris. The couple moved to London where, in 1836, Willis met <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, who was working for the "Morning Chronicle" at the time.

In 1837, Willis and his wife returned to the United States and settled at a small estate on <a href="Owego%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">Owego Creek</a> in New York, just above its junction with the <a href="Susquehanna%20River">Susquehanna River</a>. He named the home Glenmary and the rural setting inspired him to write "Letters from under a Bridge". On October 20, 1838, Willis began a series of articles called "A New Series of Letters from London", one of which suggested an illicit relationship between writer <a href="Letitia%20Elizabeth%20Landon">Letitia Elizabeth Landon</a> and editor William Jordan. The article caused some scandal, for which Willis's publisher had to apologize.

On June 20, 1839, Willis's play "Tortesa, the Usurer" premiered in Philadelphia at the Walnut Street Theatre. <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> called it "by far the best play from the pen of an American author". That year, he was also editor of the short-lived periodical "The Corsair", for which he enlisted <a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackery">William Makepeace Thackery</a> to write short sketches of France. Another major work, "Two Ways of Dying for a Husband", was published in England during a short visit there in 1839–1840. Shortly after returning to the United States, his personal life was touched with grief when his first child was <a href="stillbirth">stillborn</a> on December 4, 1840. He and Stace had a second daughter, Imogen, who was born June 20, 1842.

Later that year, Willis attended a ball in honor of Charles Dickens in New York. After dancing with Dickens's wife, Willis and Dickens went out for "<a href="hot%20toddy">rum toddy</a> and broiled oysters". By this time, his fame had grown enough that he was often invited to lecture and recite poetry, including his presentation to the <a href="Linonian%20Society">Linonian Society</a> at Yale on August 17, 1841. Willis was invited to submit a column to the each weekly issue of "Brother Johnathan", a publication from New York with 20,000 subscribers, which he did until September 1841. By 1842, Willis was earning the unusually high salary of $4,800 a year. As a later journalist remarked, this made Willis "the first magazine writer who was tolerably well paid".

In 1842, Willis employed <a href="Harriet%20Jacobs">Harriet Jacobs</a>, an escaped slave from <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, as a house servant and nanny. When her owners sought to have her returned to their plantation, Willis's wife bought her freedom for $300. Nearly two decades later, Jacobs would write in her pseudonymized autobiography "<a href="Incidents%20in%20the%20Life%20of%20a%20Slave%20Girl">Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</a>", which she began composing while working for the Willis family, that she "was convinced that ... Nathaniel Parker Willis was proslavery". Willis is depicted as "Mr. Bruce", an unattractive Southern sympathizer in the book. One of Willis's tales, "The Night Funeral of a Slave", featured an abolitionist who visits the South and regrets his anti-slavery views; <a href="Frederick%20Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a> later used the work to criticize Northerners who were pro-slavery.

Returning to New York City, Willis reorganized, along with George Pope Morris, the weekly "New York Mirror" as the daily "Evening Mirror" in 1844 with a weekly supplement called the "Weekly Mirror", in part due to the rising cost of <a href="mail">postage</a>. By this time, Willis was a popular writer (a joke was that <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a> was Germany's version of N. P. Willis) and one of the first commercially successful magazine writers in America. In the fall of that year, he also became the first editor of the annual gift book <a href="The%20Opal%20%28annual%29">"The Opal"</a> founded by <a href="Rufus%20Wilmot%20Griswold">Rufus Wilmot Griswold</a>. During this time, he became the highest-paid magazine writer in America, earning about $100 per article and $5,000 per year, a number which would soon double. Even the popular poet Longfellow admitted his jealousy of Willis's salary.

As a critic, Willis did not believe in including discussions of personalities of writers when reviewing their works. He also believed that, though publications should discuss political topics, they should not express party opinions or choose sides. The "Mirror" flourished at a time when many publications were discontinuing. Its success was due to the shrewd management of Willis and Morris and the two demonstrated that the American public could support literary endeavors. Willis was becoming an expert in American literature and so, in 1845, Willis and Morris issued an anthology, "The Prose and Poetry of America".

While Willis was editor of the "Evening Mirror", its issue for January 29, 1845, included the first printing of Poe's poem "<a href="The%20Raven">The Raven</a>" with his name attached. In his introduction, Willis called it "unsurpassed in English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification, and consistent, sustaining of imaginative lift ... It will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it". Willis and Poe were close friends, and Willis helped Poe financially during his wife <a href="Virginia%20Eliza%20Clemm%20Poe">Virginia's</a> illness and while Poe was suing <a href="Thomas%20Dunn%20English">Thomas Dunn English</a> for <a href="slander%20and%20libel">libel</a>. Willis often tried to persuade Poe to be less destructive in his criticism and concentrate on his poetry. Even so, Willis published many pieces of what would later be referred to as "The Longfellow War", a literary battle between Poe and the supporters of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, whom Poe called overrated and guilty of <a href="plagiarism">plagiarism</a>. Willis also introduced Poe to <a href="Frances%20Sargent%20Osgood">Fanny Osgood</a>; the two would later carry out a very public literary flirtation.

Willis's wife Mary Stace died in childbirth on March 25, 1845. Their daughter, Blanche, died as well and Willis wrote in his notebook that she was "an angel without fault or foible". He brought his surviving daughter Imogen to England to be with her mother's family and left her behind when he returned to the United States. In October 1846, he married Cornelia Grinnell, a wealthy Quaker from New Bedford and the adopted daughter of a local Congressman. She was two decades younger than Willis at the time and vocally disliked slavery, unlike her new husband. After the marriage, Willis's daughter Imogen came to live with the newlyweds in New York.

In 1846, Willis and Morris left the "Evening Mirror" and attempted to edit a new weekly, the "National Press", which was renamed the "Home Journal" after eight months. Their prospectus for the publication, published November 21, 1846, announced their intentions to create a magazine "to circle around the family table". Willis intended the magazine for the middle and lower classes and included the message of upward social mobility, using himself as an example, often describing in detail his personal possessions. When discussing his own social climbing, however, he emphasized his frustrations rather than his successes, endearing him to his audience. He edited the "Home Journal" until his death in 1867. It was renamed "<a href="Town%20%26amp%3B%20Country%20%28magazine%29">Town & Country</a>" in 1901, and it is still published under that title as of 2011. During Willis's time at the journal, he especially promoted the works of women poets, including <a href="Frances%20Sargent%20Osgood">Frances Sargent Osgood</a>, <a href="Anne%20Lynch%20Botta">Anne Lynch Botta</a>, <a href="Sara%20Jane%20Lippincott">Grace Greenwood</a>, and <a href="Julia%20Ward%20Howe">Julia Ward Howe</a>. Willis and his editors favorably reviewed many works now considered important today, including <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau's</a> "<a href="Walden">Walden</a>" and <a href="Nathaniel%20Hawthorne">Nathaniel Hawthorne's</a> "<a href="The%20Blithedale%20Romance">The Blithedale Romance</a>".

In 1846, Willis settled near the banks of Canterbury Creek near the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a> in New York and named his new home Idlewild. When Willis first visited the property, the owners said it had little value and that it was "an idle wild of which nothing could ever be made". He built a fourteen-room "cottage", as he called it, at the edge of a plateau by <a href="Moodna%20Creek">Moodna Creek</a> next to a sudden drop into a gorge. Willis worked closely with the architect, <a href="Calvert%20Vaux">Calvert Vaux</a>, to carefully plan each gable and piazza to fully take advantage of the dramatic view of the river and mountains.

Because of failing health Willis spent the remainder of his life chiefly in retirement at Idlewild. His wife Cornelia was also recovering from a difficult illness after the birth of their first child together, a son named Grinnell, who was born April 28, 1848. They had four other children: Lilian (born April 27, 1850), Edith (born September 28, 1853), <a href="Bailey%20Willis">Bailey</a> (born May 31, 1857), and a daughter who died only a few minutes after her birth on October 31, 1860. Harriet Jacobs was re-hired by Willis to work for the family.

During these last years at Idlewild, Willis continued contributing a weekly letter to the "Home Journal". In 1850 he assisted <a href="Rufus%20Wilmot%20Griswold">Rufus Wilmot Griswold</a> in preparing an anthology of the works of Poe, who had <a href="Death%20of%20Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">died mysteriously</a> the year before. Griswold also wrote the first biography of Poe in which he purposely set out to ruin the dead author's reputation. Willis was one of the most vocal of Poe's defenders, writing at one point: "The indictment (for it deserves no other name) is not true. It is full of cruel misrepresentations. It deepens the shadows unto unnatural darkness, and shuts out the rays of sunshines that ought to relieve them".

Willis was involved in the 1850 divorce suit between the actor <a href="Edwin%20Forrest">Edwin Forrest</a> and his wife <a href="Catherine%20Norton%20Sinclair">Catherine Norton Sinclair</a> Forrest. In January 1849, Forrest had found a <a href="love%20letter">love letter</a> to his wife from fellow actor <a href="George%20W.%20Jamieson">George W. Jamieson</a>. As a result, he and Catherine separated in April 1849. He moved to Philadelphia and filed for divorce in February 1850 though the Pennsylvania legislature denied his application. Catharine went to live with the family of <a href="Parke%20Godwin%20%28journalist%29">Parke Godwin</a> and the separation became a public affair, with newspapers throughout New York reporting on supposed infidelities and other gossip.

Willis defended Catharine, who maintained her innocence, in the "Home Journal" and suggested that Forrest was merely jealous of her intellectual superiority. On June 17, 1850, shortly after Forrest had filed for divorce in the New York Supreme Court, Forrest beat Willis with a <a href="gutta-percha">gutta-percha</a> <a href="whip">whip</a> in New York's <a href="Washington%20Square%20Park%2C%20New%20York">Washington Square</a>, shouting "this man is the seducer of my wife". Willis, who was recovering from a <a href="rheumatic%20fever">rheumatic fever</a> at the time, was unable to fight back. His wife soon received an anonymous letter with an accusation that Willis was in an adulterous relationship with Catherine Forrest. Willis later sued Forrest for assault and, by March 1852, was awarded $2,500 plus court costs. Throughout the Forrest divorce case, which lasted six weeks, several witnesses made additional claims that Catherine Forrest and Nathaniel Parker Willis were having an affair, including a waiter who claimed he had seen the couple "lying on each other". As the press reported, "thousands and thousands of the anxious public" awaited the court's verdict; ultimately, the court sided with Catherine Forrest and Willis's name was cleared.

Willis arbitrarily refused to print the work of his sister Sara Willis ("<a href="Fanny%20Fern">Fanny Fern</a>") after 1854, though she previously had contributed anonymous book reviews to the "Home Journal". She had recently been widowed, became destitute, and was publicly denounced by her abusive second husband. Criticizing what he perceived as her restlessness, Willis once made her the subject of his poem "To My Wild Sis". As Fanny Fern, she had published "Fern Leaves", which sold over 100,000 copies the year before. Willis, however, did not encourage his sister's writings. "You overstrain the pathetic, and your humor runs into dreadful vulgarity sometimes ... I am sorry that any editor knows that a sister of mine wrote some of these which you sent me", he wrote. In 1854 she published "<a href="Ruth%20Hall%20%28novel%29">Ruth Hall, a Domestic Tale of the Present Time</a>", a barely concealed semi-autobiographical account of her own difficulties in the literary world. Nathaniel Willis was represented as "Hyacinth Ellet", an effeminate, self-serving editor who schemes to ruin his sister's prospects as a writer. Willis did not publicly protest but in private he asserted that, despite his fictitious equivalent, he had done his best to support his sister during her difficult times, especially after the death of her first husband.

Among his later works, following in his traditional sketches about his life and people he has met, were "Hurry-Graphs" (1851), "Out-Doors at Idlewild" (1854), and "Ragbag" (1855). Willis had complained that his magazine writing prevented him from writing a longer work. He finally had the time in 1856, and he wrote his only novel, "Paul Fane", which was published a year later. The character Bosh Blivins, who served as <a href="comic%20relief">comic relief</a> in the novel, may have been based on painter Chester Harding. His final work was "The Convalescent" (1859), which included a chapter on his time spent with <a href="Washington%20Irving">Washington Irving</a> at <a href="Sunnyside%20%28Tarrytown%2C%20New%20York%29">Sunnyside</a>.

In July 1860, Willis took his last major trip. Along with his wife, he stopped in Chicago and <a href="Yellow%20Springs%2C%20Ohio">Yellow Springs, Ohio</a>, as far west as <a href="Madison%2C%20Wisconsin">Madison, Wisconsin</a>, and also took a steamboat down the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> to <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>, and returned through <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, Ohio and <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, Pennsylvania. In 1861, Willis allowed the "Home Journal" to break its pledge to avoid taking sides in political discussions when the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a> was established, calling the move a purposeful act to bring on war. On May 28, 1861, Willis was part of a committee of literary figures—including <a href="William%20Cullen%20Bryant">William Cullen Bryant</a>, <a href="Charles%20Anderson%20Dana">Charles Anderson Dana</a>, and <a href="Horace%20Greeley">Horace Greeley</a>—to invite <a href="Edward%20Everett">Edward Everett</a> to speak in New York on behalf of maintaining the Union. The "Home Journal" lost many subscribers during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, Morris died in 1864, and the Willis family had to take in boarders and for a time turned Idlewild into a girls' school for income.

Willis was very sick in these final years: he suffered from violent <a href="epileptic%20seizure">epileptic seizure</a>s and, early in November 1866, fainted in the streets, prompting Harriet Jacobs to return to help his wife. Willis died on his 61st birthday, January 20, 1867, and was buried in <a href="Mount%20Auburn%20Cemetery">Mount Auburn Cemetery</a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Four days later, the day of his funeral, all bookstores in the city were closed as a token of respect. His pallbearers included Longfellow, <a href="James%20Russell%20Lowell">James Russell Lowell</a>, <a href="Oliver%20Wendell%20Holmes%2C%20Sr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Gridley%20Howe">Samuel Gridley Howe</a>, and <a href="James%20Thomas%20Fields">James Thomas Fields</a>.

Throughout his literary career, Willis was well liked and known for his good nature amongst friends. Well traveled and clever, he had a striking appearance at six feet tall and was typically dressed elegantly. Many, however, remarked that Willis was effeminate, Europeanized, and guilty of "Miss Nancyism". One editor called him "an impersonal passive verb—a pronoun of the feminine gender". A contemporary <a href="caricature">caricature</a> depicted him wearing a fashionable beaver hat and tightly closed coat and carrying a cane, reflecting Willis's wide reputation as a "<a href="dandy">dandy</a>". Willis put considerable effort into his appearance and his fashion sense, presenting himself as a member of an upcoming American aristocracy. As <a href="Oliver%20Wendell%20Holmes%2C%20Sr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.</a> once said, Willis was "something between a remembrance of <a href="Alfred%20Guillaume%20Gabriel%2C%20Count%20D%27Orsay">Count D'Orsay</a> and an anticipation of <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>". Publisher <a href="Charles%20Frederick%20Briggs">Charles Frederick Briggs</a> once wrote that "Willis was too Willisy". He described his writings as the "novelty and gossip of the hour" and was not necessarily concerned about facts but with the "material of conversation and speculation, which may be mere rumor, may be the truth". Willis's behavior in social groups annoyed fellow poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. "He is too artificial", Longfellow wrote to his friend <a href="George%20Washington%20Greene">George Washington Greene</a>. "And his poetry has now lost one of its greatest charms for me—its sincerity". E. Burke Fisher, a journalist in <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, wrote that "Willis is a kind of national pet and we must regard his faults as we do those of a spoiled stripling, in the hope that he will amend".

Willis built up his reputation in the public at a time when readers were interested in the personal lives of writers. In his writings, he described the "high life" of the "<a href="Upper%20ten%20thousand">Upper Ten Thousand</a>", a phrase he coined. His travel writings in particular were popular for this reason as Willis was actually living the life he was describing and recommending to readers. Even so, he manufactured a humble and modest persona, questioned his own literary merit, and purposely used titles, such as "Pencillings by the Way" and "Dashes at Life With Free Pencil", which downplayed their own quality. His informally toned editorials, which covered a variety of topics, were also very successful. Using whimsicality and humor, he was purposely informal to allow his personality to show in his writing. He addressed his readers personally, as if having a private conversation with them. As he once wrote: "We would have you ... indulge us in our innocent egotism as if it were all whispered in your private ear and over our iced "<a href="Margaux">Margaux</a>"". When women poets were becoming popular in the 1850s, he emulated their style and focused on sentimental and moral subjects.

In the publishing world, Willis was known as a shrewd magazinist and an innovator who focused on appealing to readers' special interests while still recognizing new talent. In fact, Willis became the standard by which other magazinists were judged. According to writer <a href="George%20William%20Curtis">George William Curtis</a>, "His gayety [sic] and his graceful fluency made him the first of our proper 'magazinists'". For a time, it was said that Willis was the "most-talked-about author" in the United States. Poe questioned Willis's fame, however. "Willis is "no" genius–a graceful trifler–no more", he wrote in a letter to James Russell Lowell. "In me, at least, he never excites an emotion." Minor Southern writer Joseph Beckham Cobb wrote: "No sane person, we are persuaded, can read his poetry". Future senator <a href="Charles%20Sumner">Charles Sumner</a> reported: "I find Willis is much laughed at for his sketches". Even so, most contemporaries recognized how prolific he was as a writer and how much time he put into all of his writings. <a href="James%20Parton">James Parton</a> said of him:

By 1850 and with the publication of "Hurry-Graphs", Willis was becoming a forgotten celebrity. In August 1853, future <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a> discussed Willis's declining popularity in his diary: "Willis is said to be a <a href="wikt%3Alicentious">licentious</a> man, although an unrivaled poet. How strange that such men should go to ruin, when they might soar perpetually in the heaven of heavens". After Willis's death, obituaries reported that he had outlived his fame. One remarked, "the man who withdraws from the whirling currents of active life is speedily forgotten". This obituary also stated that Americans "will ever remember and cherish Nathaniel P. Willis as one worthy to stand with <a href="James%20Fenimore%20Cooper">Fenimore Cooper</a> and Washington Irving". In 1946, the centennial issue of "Town & Country" reported that Willis "led a generation of Americans through a gate where weeds gave way to horticulture". More modern scholars have dismissed Willis's work as "sentimental prattle" or refer to him only as an obstacle in the progress of his sister as well as Harriet Jacobs. As biographer Thomas N. Baker wrote, Willis is today only referred to as a footnote in relation to other authors.

Like a Rolling Stone

"Like a Rolling Stone" is a 1965 song by the American singer-songwriter <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>. Its confrontational lyrics originated in an extended piece of verse Dylan wrote in June 1965, when he returned exhausted from a grueling <a href="Bob%20Dylan%20UK%20Tour%201965">tour of England</a>. Dylan distilled this draft into four verses and a chorus. "Like a Rolling Stone" was recorded a few weeks later as part of the sessions for the forthcoming album "<a href="Highway%2061%20Revisited">Highway 61 Revisited</a>".

During a difficult two-day preproduction, Dylan struggled to find the essence of the song, which was demoed without success in <a href="Triple%20time">time</a>. A breakthrough was made when it was tried in a <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a> format, and rookie session musician <a href="Al%20Kooper">Al Kooper</a> improvised the <a href="Organ%20%28music%29">organ</a> riff for which the track is known. However, <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> was unhappy with both the song's length at over six minutes and its heavy electric sound, and was hesitant to release it. It was only when a month later a copy was leaked to a new popular music club and heard by influential DJs that the song was put out as a single. Although radio stations were reluctant to play such a long track, "Like a Rolling Stone" reached No. 2 in the US "Billboard" charts (No. 1 in "Cashbox") and became a worldwide hit.

Critics have described the track as revolutionary in its combination of different musical elements, the youthful, cynical sound of Dylan's voice, and the directness of the question "How does it feel?" "Like a Rolling Stone" completed the transformation of Dylan's image from folk singer to rock star, and is considered one of the most influential compositions in postwar popular music. According to review aggregator <a href="Acclaimed%20Music">Acclaimed Music</a>, "Like a Rolling Stone" is the statistically most acclaimed song of all time. "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine listed the song at No. 1 in their "<a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a>" list. The song has been covered by numerous artists, from <a href="The%20Jimi%20Hendrix%20Experience">The Jimi Hendrix Experience</a> and <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">The Rolling Stones</a> to <a href="Bob%20Marley%20and%20the%20Wailers">The Wailers</a> and <a href="Green%20Day">Green Day</a>. At an auction in 2014, Dylan's handwritten lyrics to the song fetched $2 million, a world record for a popular music manuscript.

In the spring of 1965, after returning from the tour of England documented in the film "<a href="Dont%20Look%20Back">Dont Look Back</a>", Dylan was unhappy with the public's expectations of him, as well as the direction his career was taking, and seriously considered quitting the music business. In a 1966 "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>" interview, he described his dissatisfaction: "Last spring, I guess I was going to quit singing. I was very drained, and the way things were going, it was a very draggy situation ... But 'Like a Rolling Stone' changed it all. I mean it was something that I myself could dig. It's very tiring having other people tell you how much they dig you if you yourself don't dig you."

The song grew out of an extended piece of verse. In 1966, Dylan described its genesis to journalist <a href="Jules%20Siegel">Jules Siegel</a>:

During 1965, Dylan composed prose, poems, and songs by typing incessantly. Footage in "Dont Look Back" of Dylan in his suite at London's <a href="Savoy%20Hotel">Savoy Hotel</a> captures this process. However, Dylan told two interviewers that "Like a Rolling Stone" began as a long piece of "vomit" (10 pages long according to one account, 20 according to another) that later acquired musical form. Dylan has never publicly spoken of writing any other major composition in this way. In an interview with <a href="CBC%20radio">CBC radio</a> in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, Dylan called the creation of the song a "breakthrough", explaining that it changed his perception of where he was going in his career. He said that he found himself writing "this long piece of vomit, 20 pages long, and out of it I took 'Like a Rolling Stone' and made it as a single. And I'd never written anything like that before and it suddenly came to me that was what I should do ... After writing that I wasn't interested in writing a novel, or a play. I just had too much, I want to write songs."

From the extended version on paper, Dylan crafted four verses and the chorus in <a href="Woodstock%2C%20New%20York">Woodstock</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>. In 2014, when the handwritten lyrics were put up for auction, the four-page manuscript revealed that the full refrain of the chorus does not appear until the fourth page. A rejected third line, "like a dog without a bone" gives way to "now you're unknown". Earlier, Dylan had considered working the name <a href="Al%20Capone">Al Capone</a> into the rhyme scheme, and he attempted to construct a rhyme scheme for "how does it feel?", penciling in "it feels real", "does it feel real", "shut up and deal", "get down and kneel" and "raw deal". The song was written on an upright piano in the key of A flat and was changed to C on the guitar in the recording studio.

For the recording session, Dylan invited <a href="Mike%20Bloomfield">Mike Bloomfield</a> from the <a href="Paul%20Butterfield">Paul Butterfield Blues Band</a> to play lead guitar. Invited to Dylan's Woodstock home for the weekend to learn new material, Bloomfield recalled, "The first thing I heard was 'Like a Rolling Stone'. I figured he wanted blues, string bending, because that's what I do. He said, 'Hey, man, I don't want any of that <a href="B.B.%20King">B.B. King</a> stuff'. So, OK, I really fell apart. What the heck does he want? We messed around with the song. I played the way that he dug, and he said it was groovy."

The recording sessions were produced by <a href="Tom%20Wilson%20%28record%20producer%29">Tom Wilson</a> on June 15–16, 1965, in Studio A of <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>, 799 Seventh Avenue, in New York City. This would be the last song Wilson would produce for Dylan. In addition to Bloomfield, the musicians enlisted were <a href="Paul%20Griffin%20%28musician%29">Paul Griffin</a> on piano, Joe Macho, Jr. on bass, <a href="Bobby%20Gregg">Bobby Gregg</a> on drums, and <a href="Bruce%20Langhorne">Bruce Langhorne</a> on tambourine, all booked by Wilson. Gregg, Griffin, and Langhorne had previously worked with Dylan and Wilson on "<a href="Bringing%20It%20All%20Back%20Home">Bringing It All Back Home</a>".
In the first session, on June 15, five takes of the song were recorded in a markedly different style ( waltz time, with Dylan on piano) from the eventual release. The lack of sheet music meant the song had to be played by ear. However, its essence was discovered in the course of the chaotic session. The musicians did not reach the first chorus until the fourth take, but after the following harmonica fill Dylan interrupted, saying, "My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?" This take was subsequently released on "<a href="The%20Bootleg%20Series%20Volumes%201%E2%80%933%20%28Rare%20%26amp%3B%20Unreleased%29%201961%E2%80%931991">The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991</a>". The session ended shortly afterward.

When the musicians reconvened the following day, June 16, <a href="Al%20Kooper">Al Kooper</a> joined the proceedings. Kooper, at that time a 21-year-old session guitarist, was not originally supposed to play but was present in the studio as Wilson's guest. When Wilson stepped out, Kooper sat down with his guitar with the other musicians, hoping to take part in the recording session. By the time Wilson returned, Kooper, who had been intimidated by Bloomfield's guitar playing, was back in the control room. After a couple of rehearsal takes, Wilson moved Griffin from <a href="Hammond%20organ">Hammond organ</a> to piano. Kooper approached Wilson and told him he had a good part for the organ. Wilson belittled Kooper's organ skills but did not forbid him to play. As Kooper later put it, "He just sort of scoffed at me ... He didn't say 'no'—so I went out there." Wilson was surprised to see Kooper at the organ but allowed him to play on the track. When Dylan heard a playback of the song, he insisted that the organ be turned up in the mix, despite Wilson's protestations that Kooper was "not an organ player."

There were 15 recorded takes on June 16. By now the song had evolved into its familiar form, in time with Dylan on electric guitar. After the fourth take—the master take that was released as a single—Wilson happily commented, "That sounds good to me." Despite this, Dylan and the band recorded the song 11 more times.

The complete recording sessions that produced "Like a Rolling Stone", including all 20 takes and the individual "stems" that comprise the four-track master, were released in November 2015 on the 6-disc and 18-disc versions of "".

According to Shaun Considine, release coordinator for <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> in 1965, "Like a Rolling Stone" was first relegated to the "graveyard of canceled releases" because of concerns from the sales and marketing departments over its unprecedented six-minute length and "raucous" rock sound. In the days following the rejection, Considine took a discarded <a href="acetate%20disc">acetate</a> of the song to the New York club Arthur—a newly opened disco popular with celebrities and the media—and asked a DJ to play it. At the crowd's insistence, the demo was played repeatedly, until finally it wore out. The next morning, a disc jockey and a programming director from the city's leading top 40 stations called Columbia and demanded copies. Shortly afterward, on July 20, 1965, "Like a Rolling Stone" was released as a single with "<a href="Gates%20of%20Eden%20%28song%29">Gates of Eden</a>" as its B-side.

Despite its length, the song is Dylan's most commercially successful release, remaining in the US charts for 12 weeks, where it reached number 2 behind <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>' "<a href="Help%21%20%28song%29">Help!</a>". The promotional copies released to disc jockeys on July 15 had the first two verses and two refrains on one side of the disk, and the remainder of the song on the other. DJs wishing to play the entire song would simply flip the vinyl over. While many radio stations were reluctant to play "Like a Rolling Stone" in its entirety, public demand eventually forced them to air it in full. This helped the single reach its number 2 peak, several weeks after its release. It was a Top 10 hit in other countries, including <a href="RPM%20%28magazine%29">Canada</a>, <a href="Irish%20Singles%20Chart">Ireland</a>, the <a href="Dutch%20Top%2040">Netherlands</a>, and the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">United Kingdom</a>.


Unlike conventional chart hits of the time, "Like a Rolling Stone" featured lyrics that were interpreted as expressions of resentment rather than love. Author Oliver Trager characterizes the lyrics as: "Dylan's sneer at a woman who has fallen from grace and is reduced to fending for herself in a hostile, unfamiliar world." The song's subject, "Miss Lonely," previously opted for easy options in life—she attended the finest schools and enjoyed high-placed friends—but now that her situation has become difficult, it appears that she has no meaningful experiences to define her character. The opening lines of the song establish the character's former condition:

And the first verse ends with lines that seemingly deride her current condition:

Despite the obvious vitriol, the song's narrator also seems to show compassion for Miss Lonely, and expresses joy for her in the freedom in losing everything. <a href="Jann%20Wenner">Jann Wenner</a> commented: "Everything has been stripped away. You're on your own, you're free now ... You're so helpless and now you've got nothing left. And you're invisible—you've got no secrets—that's so liberating. You've nothing to fear anymore." The final verse ends with the lines:

The <a href="refrain">refrain</a> seems to emphasize these themes:

Dylan biographer <a href="Robert%20Shelton%20%28critic%29">Robert Shelton</a> gave this interpretation: "A song that seems to hail the dropout life for those who can take it segues into compassion for those who have dropped out of bourgeois surroundings. 'Rolling Stone' is about the loss of innocence and the harshness of experience. Myths, props, and old beliefs fall away to reveal a very taxing reality."

Dylan humorously commented on the song's moral perspective at a press conference at <a href="KQED%20%28TV%29">KQED</a> television studio on December 3, 1965. When a reporter, suggesting that the song adopted a harsh perspective on a girl, asked Dylan, "Are you hard on [people in your songs] because you want to torment them? Or to change their lives and make them know themselves?", Dylan replied while laughing, "I want to needle them."

Commentators attempted to tie the characters in the song to specific people in Dylan's personal life in 1965. In his book "", <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> recalled that some people in his circle believed that "Like a Rolling Stone" contained hostile references to him; he was told, "Listen to 'Like a Rolling Stone'—I think you're the diplomat on the chrome horse, man." The reason behind Dylan's alleged hostility to Warhol was supposedly Warhol's treatment of actress and model <a href="Edie%20Sedgwick">Edie Sedgwick</a>. It has been suggested that Sedgwick is the basis of the Miss Lonely character. Sedgwick was briefly involved with Dylan in late 1965 and early 1966, around which time there was some discussion of the two making a movie together. According to Warhol's collaborator <a href="Paul%20Morrissey">Paul Morrissey</a>, Sedgwick may have been in love with Dylan, and was shocked when she found out that Dylan had secretly married <a href="Sara%20Lownds">Sara Lownds</a> in November 1965. However, in "<a href="The%20Bob%20Dylan%20Encyclopedia">The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia</a>", <a href="Michael%20Gray%20%28author%29">Michael Gray</a> argues that Sedgwick had no connection with "Like a Rolling Stone", but states "there's no doubt that the ghost of Edie Sedgwick hangs around "<a href="Blonde%20on%20Blonde">Blonde on Blonde</a>"".

<a href="Greil%20Marcus">Greil Marcus</a> alluded to a suggestion by art historian <a href="Thomas%20E.%20Crow">Thomas E. Crow</a> that Dylan had written the song as a comment on Warhol's scene:
I heard a lecture by Thomas Crow ... about "Like a Rolling Stone" being about Edie Sedgwick within Andy Warhol's circle, as something that Dylan saw from the outside, not being personally involved with either of them, but as something he saw and was scared by and saw disaster looming and wrote a song as a warning, and it was compelling.

<a href="Joan%20Baez">Joan Baez</a>, <a href="Marianne%20Faithfull">Marianne Faithfull</a> and <a href="Bob%20Neuwirth">Bob Neuwirth</a> have also been suggested as possible targets of Dylan's scorn. Dylan's biographer <a href="Howard%20Sounes">Howard Sounes</a> warned against reducing the song to the biography of one person, and suggested "it is more likely that the song was aimed generally at those [Dylan] perceived as being 'phony. Sounes adds, "There is some irony in the fact that one of the most famous songs of the <a href="folk-rock">folk-rock</a> era—an era associated primarily with ideals of peace and harmony—is one of vengeance."

<a href="Mike%20Marqusee">Mike Marqusee</a> has written at length on the conflicts in Dylan's life during this time, with its deepening alienation from his old folk-revival audience and clear-cut leftist causes. He suggests that the song is probably self-referential: "The song only attains full poignancy when one realises it is sung, at least in part, to the singer himself: he's the one 'with no direction home. Dylan himself has noted that, after his motorcycle accident in 1966, he realized that "when I used words like 'he' and 'it' and 'they,' and talking about other people, I was really talking about nobody but me."

In November 2013, 48 years after the release of the song, Dylan's website released an official music video for "Like a Rolling Stone". Created by digital agency Interlude, the video is interactive, allowing viewers to use their keyboards to flip through 16 channels that imitate TV formats, including game shows, shopping networks and reality series. People on each channel appear to lip-sync the song's lyrics. Video director <a href="Vania%20Heymann">Vania Heymann</a> stated, "I'm using the medium of television to look back right at us — you're flipping yourself to death with switching channels [in real life]." The video contains an hour and 15 minutes worth of content in all and features appearances from comedian <a href="Marc%20Maron">Marc Maron</a>, rapper <a href="Danny%20Brown%20%28rapper%29">Danny Brown</a>, "<a href="The%20Price%20Is%20Right%20%28U.S.%20game%20show%29">The Price Is Right</a>" host <a href="Drew%20Carey">Drew Carey</a>, "<a href="SportsCenter">SportsCenter</a>" anchor <a href="Steve%20Levy">Steve Levy</a>, Jonathan and Drew Scott of "<a href="Property%20Brothers">Property Brothers</a>", and "<a href="Pawn%20Stars">Pawn Stars</a>" cast members <a href="Rick%20Harrison">Rick Harrison</a> and <a href="Chumlee">Austin "Chumlee" Russell</a>. The video was released to publicize the release of a 35 album box set, "", containing Dylan's 35 official studio albums and 11 live albums. The "<a href="Guinness%20Book%20of%20World%20Records">Guinness Book of World Records</a>" recorded it as the longest wait for an official music video.

Dylan performed the song live for the first time within days of its release, when he appeared at the <a href="Newport%20Folk%20Festival">Newport Folk Festival</a> on July 25, 1965 in Newport, Rhode Island. Many of the audience's folk enthusiasts objected to <a href="Electric%20Dylan%20controversy">Dylan's use of electric guitars</a>, looking down on rock 'n roll, as Bloomfield put it, as popular amongst "greasers, heads, dancers, people who got drunk and boogied." According to Dylan's friend, music critic <a href="Paul%20Nelson%20%28critic%29">Paul Nelson</a>, "The audience [was] booing and yelling 'Get rid of the electric guitar, while Dylan and his backing musicians gave an uncertain rendition of their new single.

"Highway 61 Revisited" was issued at the end of August 1965. When Dylan went on tour that fall he asked the future members of <a href="The%20Band">The Band</a> to accompany him in performing the electric half of the concerts. "Like a Rolling Stone" took the closing slot on his setlist and held it, with rare exceptions, through the end of his 1966 "world tour." On May 17, 1966, during the last leg of the tour, Dylan and his band performed at Free Trade Hall in <a href="Manchester%2C%20England">Manchester, England</a>. Just before they started to play the track, an audience member yelled "Judas!", apparently referring to Dylan's supposed "betrayal" of folk music. Dylan responded, "I don't believe you. You're a liar!" With that, he turned to the band, ordering them to "play it fucking loud".

Since then, "Like a Rolling Stone" has remained a staple in Dylan's concerts, often with revised arrangements. It was included in his 1969 <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a> show and in both his reunion tour with <a href="The%20Band">The Band</a> in 1974 and the <a href="Rolling%20Thunder%20Revue">Rolling Thunder Revue</a> tour in 1975–76.

The song's sound has been described as revolutionary in its combination of electric guitar licks, organ chords, and Dylan's voice, at once young and jeeringly cynical. Critic <a href="Michael%20Gray%20%28author%29">Michael Gray</a> described the track as "a chaotic amalgam of blues, impressionism, allegory, and an intense directness in the central chorus: 'How does it feel. The song had an enormous impact on popular culture and rock music. Its success made Dylan a pop icon, as <a href="Paul%20Williams%20%28Crawdaddy%21%20creator%29">Paul Williams</a> notes:

<a href="Paul%20Rothchild">Paul Rothchild</a>, producer of <a href="The%20Doors">The Doors</a>' first five albums, recalled the elation that an American musician had made a record that successfully challenged the primacy of the <a href="British%20Invasion">British Invasion</a> groups. He said, "What I realized when I was sitting there is that one of US—one of the so-called <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Village</a> hipsters—was making music that could compete with THEM—<a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>, and <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">the Stones</a>, and the <a href="Dave%20Clark%20Five">Dave Clark Five</a>—without sacrificing any of the integrity of folk music or the power of rock'n'roll."

The song had a huge impact on <a href="Bruce%20Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>, who was 15 years old when he first heard it. Springsteen described the moment during his speech inducting Dylan into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in 1988 and also assessed the long-term significance of "Like a Rolling Stone":

Dylan's contemporaries in 1965 were both startled and challenged by the single. <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> remembered going around to <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a>'s house in <a href="Weybridge">Weybridge</a> to hear the song. According to McCartney, "It seemed to go on and on forever. It was just beautiful ... He showed all of us that it was possible to go a little further." <a href="Frank%20Zappa">Frank Zappa</a> had a more extreme reaction: "When I heard 'Like a Rolling Stone', I wanted to quit the music business, because I felt: 'If this wins and it does what it's supposed to do, I don't need to do anything else ...' But it didn't do anything. It sold but nobody responded to it in the way that they should have." Nearly forty years later, in 2003, <a href="Elvis%20Costello">Elvis Costello</a> commented on the innovative quality of the single. "What a shocking thing to live in a world where there was <a href="Manfred%20Mann">Manfred Mann</a> and <a href="the%20Supremes">the Supremes</a> and <a href="Engelbert%20Humperdinck%20%28singer%29">Engelbert Humperdinck</a> and here comes 'Like a Rolling Stone'".

Although CBS tried to make the record more "radio friendly" by cutting it in half and spreading it over both sides of the vinyl, both Dylan and fans demanded that the full duration of the recording should be placed on one side and that radio stations play the song in its entirety. The success of "Like a Rolling Stone" was influential in changing the music business convention regarding the length of singles, whereby they were restricted to durations of less than three minutes. In the words of "Rolling Stone" magazine, "No other pop song has so thoroughly challenged and transformed the commercial laws and artistic conventions of its time, for all time." Richard Austin, of <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a> auction house, said: "Before the release of Like a Rolling Stone, music charts were overrun with short and sweet love songs, many clocking in at three minutes or less. By defying convention with six and a half minutes of dark, brooding poetry, Dylan rewrote the rules for pop music."

In 1966, Dylan told <a href="Ralph%20Gleason">Ralph Gleason</a>: Rolling Stone's the best song I wrote." In 2004, speaking to <a href="Robert%20Hilburn">Robert Hilburn</a>, Dylan still felt that the song had a special place in his work: "It's like a ghost is writing a song like that, it gives you the song and it goes away. You don't know what it means. Except that the ghost picked me to write the song."

More than 50 years since its release, "Like a Rolling Stone" remains highly regarded, as measured by polls of reviewers and fellow songwriters. A 2002 ranking by "<a href="Uncut%20%28magazine%29">Uncut</a>" and a 2005 poll in "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>" both rated it as Dylan's number one song. As for his personal views on such polls, Dylan told <a href="Ed%20Bradley">Ed Bradley</a> in a 2004 interview on "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>" that he never pays attention to them, because they change frequently. Dylan's point was illustrated in the "100 Greatest Songs of All Time poll" by "Mojo" in 2000, which included two Dylan singles, but not "Like a Rolling Stone". Five years later, the magazine named it his number one song. "Rolling Stone" picked "Like a Rolling Stone" as the number two single of the past 25 years in 1989, and then in 2004 placed the song at number one on its list of "<a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a>". In 2010, "Rolling Stone" again placed "Like a Rolling Stone" at the top of their list of "500 Greatest Songs Of All Time". In 2006, <a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a> placed it at number 4 on their list of "The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s".

On June 24, 2014, <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a> sold Dylan's original hand-written lyrics of "Like a Rolling Stone" at a New York auction devoted to rock memorabilia. The lyrics were sold for $2 million, a record price for a popular music manuscript.

Elizabeth David

Elizabeth David, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> (born Elizabeth Gwynne, 26 December 1913 – 22 May 1992) was a British cookery writer. In the mid-20th century she strongly influenced the revitalisation of home cookery in her native country and beyond with articles and books about <a href="European%20cuisine">European cuisine</a>s and traditional <a href="British%20cuisine">British dishes</a>.

Born to an upper-class family, David rebelled against social norms of the day. In the 1930s she studied art in Paris, became an actress, and ran off with a married man with whom she sailed in a small boat to Italy, where their boat was confiscated. They reached Greece, where they were nearly trapped by the <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">German invasion in 1941</a>, but escaped to Egypt, where they parted. She then worked for the British government, running a library in Cairo. While there she married, but she and her husband separated soon after and subsequently divorced.

In 1946 David returned to England, where <a href="Rationing%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">food rationing</a> imposed during the Second World War remained in force. Dismayed by the contrast between the bad food served in Britain and the simple, excellent food to which she had become accustomed in France, Greece and Egypt, she began to write magazine articles about Mediterranean cooking. They attracted favourable attention, and in 1950, at the age of 36, she published "<a href="A%20Book%20of%20Mediterranean%20Food">A Book of Mediterranean Food</a>". Her recipes called for ingredients such as <a href="Eggplant">aubergines</a>, basil, figs, garlic, olive oil and saffron, which at the time were scarcely available in Britain. Books on French, Italian and, later, English cuisine followed. By the 1960s David was a major influence on British cooking. She was deeply hostile to anything second-rate, and to over-elaborate cooking and bogus substitutes for classic dishes and ingredients. In 1965 she opened a shop selling kitchen equipment, which continued to trade under her name after she left it in 1973.

David's reputation rests on her articles and her books, which have been continually reprinted. Between 1950 and 1984 she published eight books; after her death her literary executor completed a further four that she had planned and worked on. David's influence on British cooking extended to professional as well as domestic cooks, and chefs and restaurateurs of later generations such as <a href="Terence%20Conran">Terence Conran</a>, <a href="Simon%20Hopkinson">Simon Hopkinson</a>, <a href="Prue%20Leith">Prue Leith</a>, <a href="Jamie%20Oliver">Jamie Oliver</a>, <a href="Tom%20Parker%20Bowles">Tom Parker Bowles</a> and <a href="Rick%20Stein">Rick Stein</a> have acknowledged her importance to them. In the US, cooks and writers including <a href="Julia%20Child">Julia Child</a>, <a href="Richard%20Olney%20%28food%20writer%29">Richard Olney</a> and <a href="Alice%20Waters">Alice Waters</a> have written of her influence.

David was born Elizabeth Gwynne, the second of four children, all daughters, of <a href="Rupert%20Gwynne">Rupert Sackville Gwynne</a> and his wife, the Hon Stella Gwynne, daughter of the <a href="Matthew%20White%20Ridley%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Ridley">1st Viscount Ridley</a>. Both parents' families had considerable fortunes, the Gwynnes from engineering and land speculation and the Ridleys from coal mining. Through the two families, David was of English, Scottish and Welsh or Irish descent and, through an ancestor on her father's side, also Dutch and <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>n. She and her sisters grew up at <a href="Wootton%20Manor">Wootton Manor</a> in <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a>, a seventeenth-century manor house with extensive, early twentieth-century additions by <a href="Detmar%20Blow">Detmar Blow</a>. Her father, despite having a weak heart, insisted on pursuing a demanding political career, becoming <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> <a href="Member%20of%20parliament%23United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Northern%20Ireland">MP</a> for <a href="Eastbourne%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Eastbourne</a>, and a junior minister in <a href="Bonar%20Law">Bonar Law</a>'s government. Overwork, combined with his vigorous recreational pastimes, chiefly racing, riding, and womanising, brought about his death in 1924, aged 51.

The widowed Stella Gwynne was a dutiful mother, but her relations with her daughters were distant rather than affectionate. Elizabeth and her sisters, Priscilla, Diana and Felicité were sent away to boarding schools. Having been a pupil at Godstowe <a href="Preparatory%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">preparatory school</a> in <a href="High%20Wycombe">High Wycombe</a>, Elizabeth was sent to St Clare's Private School for Ladies, <a href="Tunbridge%20Wells">Tunbridge Wells</a>, which she left at the age of sixteen. The girls grew up knowing nothing of cooking, which in upper-class households of the time was the exclusive province of the family's <a href="Cook%20%28domestic%20worker%29">cook</a> and her kitchen staff.

As a teenager David enjoyed painting, and her mother thought her talent worth developing. In 1930 she was sent to Paris, where she studied painting privately and enrolled at the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">Sorbonne</a> for a course in French civilisation which covered history, literature and architecture. She found her Sorbonne studies arduous and in many ways uninspiring, but they left her with a love of French literature and a fluency in the language that remained with her throughout her life. She lodged with a Parisian family, whose fanatical devotion to the pleasures of the table she portrayed to comic effect in her "<a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23French%20Provincial%20Cooking%20%281960%29">French Provincial Cooking</a>" (1960). Nevertheless, she acknowledged in retrospect that the experience had been the most valuable part of her time in Paris: "I realized in what way the family had fulfilled their task of instilling French culture into at least one of their British charges. Forgotten were the Sorbonne professors. ... What had stuck was the taste for a kind of food quite ideally unlike anything I had known before." Stella Gwynne was not eager for her daughter's early return to England after qualifying for her Sorbonne diploma, and sent her from Paris to Munich in 1931 to study German.

After returning to England in 1932 David unenthusiastically went through the social rituals for upper-class young women of presentation at court as a <a href="Debutante%23United%20Kingdom">débutante</a> and the associated <a href="Ball%20%28dance%20party%29">balls</a>. The respectable young Englishmen she met at the latter did not appeal to her. David's biographer Lisa Chaney comments that with her "delicately smouldering looks and her shyness shielded by a steely coolness and barbed tongue" she would have been a daunting prospect for the young upper-class men she encountered. David decided that she was not good enough as a painter and, to her mother's displeasure, became an actress. She joined <a href="J.%20B.%20Fagan">J. B. Fagan</a>'s company at the <a href="Oxford%20Playhouse">Oxford Playhouse</a> in 1933. Her fellow performers included <a href="Joan%20Hickson">Joan Hickson</a>, who decades later recalled having to show her new colleague how to make a cup of tea, so unaware of the kitchen was David in those days.
From Oxford, David moved to the <a href="Open%20Air%20Theatre%2C%20Regent%27s%20Park">Open Air Theatre</a> in <a href="Regent%27s%20Park">Regent's Park</a>, London, the following year. She rented rooms in a large house near the park, spent a generous 21st birthday present on equipping the kitchen, and learned to cook. A gift from her mother of "The Gentle Art of Cookery" by <a href="Hilda%20Leyel">Hilda Leyel</a> was her first cookery book. She later wrote, "I wonder if I would have ever learned to cook at all if I had been given a routine <a href="Isabella%20Beeton">Mrs Beeton</a> to learn from, instead of the romantic Mrs Leyel with her rather wild, imagination-catching recipes."

At Regent's Park David made little professional progress. The company was distinguished, headed by <a href="Nigel%20Playfair">Nigel Playfair</a> and <a href="Jack%20Hawkins">Jack Hawkins</a>, and, in the leading female roles, <a href="Anna%20Neagle">Anna Neagle</a> and <a href="Margaretta%20Scott">Margaretta Scott</a>. David was restricted to <a href="bit%20parts">bit parts</a>. Among her colleagues in the company was an actor nine years her senior, Charles Gibson Cowan. His disregard for social conventions appealed strongly to her, and she also found him sexually irresistible. His being married did not daunt either of them, and they began an affair that outlasted her stage career. Chaney comments, "Cowan was the ultimate outsider. He was working class, left wing, Jewish, an actor, a pickpocket, a vagabond, who lived in caves in Hastings for a time. Her mother called him a 'pacifist worm'. He was a sexual presence, and slept with anything that moved." David's mother strongly disapproved, and tried to put a stop to the affair. She arranged for her daughter to spend several weeks holidaying with family and friends in Malta in the first half of 1936 and in Egypt later in the same year, but in her 1999 biography <a href="Artemis%20Cooper">Artemis Cooper</a> comments that David's lengthy absence failed to detach her from her involvement with Cowan. During her stay in Malta, David was able to spend time learning from her hostess's cook, Angela, who was happy to pass on her expertise. Although she could produce elaborate grand dinners when required, the most important lesson she taught David was to work day in, day out, with all available ingredients, showing her how to make an old bird or a stringy piece of meat into a good dish.

After her return to London in early 1937, David recognised that she was not going to be a success on the stage, and abandoned thoughts of a theatrical career. Later in the year she took a post as a junior assistant at the fashion house of <a href="House%20of%20Worth">Worth</a>, where elegant young women from upper-class backgrounds were sought after as recruits. She found the subservience of retail work irksome, and resigned in early 1938. Over the next few months she spent time holidaying in the south of France and on <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a>, where she was greatly taken with the outgoing nature of the people she stayed with and the simple excellence of their food. After returning to London, and disenchanted with life there, she joined Cowan in buying a small boat—a <a href="yawl">yawl</a> with an engine—with the intention of sailing it to Greece. They crossed the Channel in July 1939 and navigated the boat through the canal system of France to the Mediterranean coast.

The outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 halted their progress. After stopping briefly at <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a> they sailed on to <a href="Antibes">Antibes</a>, where they remained for more than six months, unable to gain permission to leave. There David met and became greatly influenced by the ageing writer <a href="Norman%20Douglas">Norman Douglas</a>, about whom she later wrote extensively. He inspired her love of the Mediterranean, encouraged her interest in good food, and taught her to "search out the best, insist on it, and reject all that was bogus and second-rate". Cooper describes him as David's most important mentor.

David and Cowan finally left Antibes in May 1940, sailing to Corsica and then towards <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>. They had reached the <a href="Strait%20of%20Messina">Strait of Messina</a> when Italy entered the war on 10 June. They were suspected of spying and were interned. After 19 days in custody in various parts of Italy, they were allowed to cross the border into <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, which at that point remained neutral and non-combatant. They had lost almost everything they owned—the boat, money, manuscripts, notebooks, and David's cherished collection of recipes. With the help of the British Consul in <a href="Zagreb">Zagreb</a>, they crossed into Greece, and arrived in Athens in July 1940. By this time, David was no longer in love with her partner but remained with him from necessity. Cowan found a job teaching English on the island of <a href="Syros">Syros</a>, where David learnt to cook with the fresh ingredients available locally. When the Germans invaded Greece in April 1941, the couple managed to leave on a civilian convoy to Egypt.

Able to speak excellent French and good German, David secured a job in the naval <a href="cipher">cipher</a> office in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. She was quickly rescued from temporary refugee accommodation, having met an old English friend who had an "absurdly grandiose" flat in the city and invited her to keep house for him. She and Cowan amicably went their separate ways, and she moved into the grand flat. She engaged a cook, Kyriacou, a Greek refugee, whose eccentricities (sketched in a chapter of "<a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23Is%20There%20a%20Nutmeg%20in%20the%20House%3F%20%282000%29">Is There a Nutmeg in the House?</a>") did not prevent him from producing magnificent food: "The flavour of that octopus stew, the rich wine dark sauce and the aroma of mountain herbs was something not easily forgotten." In 1942 she caught an infection that affected her feet. She spent some weeks in hospital and felt obliged to give up her job in the cipher office. She then moved to Cairo, where she was asked to set up and run a reference library for the British <a href="Ministry%20of%20Information%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Information</a>. The library was open to everyone and was much in demand by journalists and other writers. Her circle of friends in this period included <a href="Alan%20Moorehead">Alan Moorehead</a>, <a href="Freya%20Stark">Freya Stark</a>, <a href="Bernard%20Spencer">Bernard Spencer</a>, <a href="Patrick%20Kinross">Patrick Kinross</a>, <a href="Olivia%20Manning">Olivia Manning</a> and <a href="Lawrence%20Durrell">Lawrence Durrell</a>. At her tiny flat in the city, she employed Suleiman, a Sudanese "suffragi" (a cook-housekeeper). She recalled:
Cooper comments on this period of David's life, "Pictures of her at the time show a quintessential librarian, dressed in a dark cardigan over a white shirt with a prim little collar buttoned up to the neck: but at night, dressed in exotic spangled caftans, she was a different creature: drinking at Hedjaki's bar, eating at the P'tit Coin de France, dancing on the roof of the Continental and then going on to Madame Badia's nightclub or the glamorous Auberge des Pyramides." In her years in Cairo, David had a number of affairs. She enjoyed them for what they were, but only once fell in love. That was with a young officer, Peter Laing, but the relationship came to an end when he was seriously wounded and returned to his native Canada. Several other of her young men fell in love with her; one of them was <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant-Colonel</a> Anthony David (1911–1967). By now aged thirty, she weighed the advantages and disadvantages of remaining unmarried until such time as the ideal husband might appear, and with considerable misgivings she finally accepted Tony David's proposal of marriage.

The couple were married in Cairo on 30 August 1944. Within a year, Tony David was posted to India. His wife followed him there in January 1946, but she found life as the wife of an officer of the <a href="British%20Raj">British Raj</a> tedious, the social life dull, and the food generally "frustrating". Later in life she came to appreciate the cuisine more, and wrote about a few Indian dishes and recipes in her articles and books. In June 1946, she suffered severe <a href="sinusitis">sinusitis</a> and was told by her doctors that the condition would persist if she remained in the summer heat of <a href="New%20Delhi">Delhi</a>. Instead, she was advised to go back to England. She did so; Cooper observes, "She had been away from England for six years, and in that time she, and England, had changed beyond recognition."

Returning after her years of Mediterranean warmth and access to a profusion of fresh ingredients, David found her native country in the post-war period grey and daunting, with <a href="Rationing%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Post-Second%20World%20War">food rationing</a> still in force. She encountered terrible food: "There was flour and water soup seasoned solely with pepper; bread and <a href="Hyaline%20cartilage">gristle</a> <a href="Rissole%23Australia%2C%20Britain%20and%20New%20Zealand">rissoles</a>; dehydrated onions and carrots; corned beef <a href="toad%20in%20the%20hole">toad in the hole</a>. I need not go on." In London, she met George Lassalle, a former lover of hers from Cairo days, and their affair was rekindled. The couple went to <a href="Ross-on-Wye">Ross-on-Wye</a> in November 1946 for a week's break, but were stranded in the town by the <a href="Winter%20of%201946%E2%80%9347%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">season's inclement weather</a>. Frustrated by the poor food provided by the hotel, she was encouraged by Lassalle to put her thoughts on paper.

Hardly knowing what I was doing ... I sat down and started to work out an agonized craving for the sun and a furious revolt against that terrible cheerless, heartless food by writing down descriptions of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cooking. Even to write words like apricot, olives and butter, rice and lemons, oil and almonds, produced assuagement. Later I came to realize that in the England of 1947, those were dirty words I was putting down.

When her husband returned from India in 1947, David immediately separated from Lassalle and resumed the role of wife. With the aid of Stella Gwynne, David and her husband bought a house in <a href="Chelsea%2C%20London">Chelsea</a>, which remained her home for the rest of her life. Tony David proved ineffectual in civilian life, unable to find a suitable job; he ran up debts, partly from a failed business venture. What remained of the spark in the relationship soon died, and they were living separately by 1948.

Veronica Nicholson, a friend with connections in the publishing trade, persuaded David to continue writing, with the aim that she write a book. She showed some of David's work to <a href="Anne%20Scott-James">Anne Scott-James</a>, the editor of the British edition of "<a href="Harper%27s%20Bazaar">Harper's Bazaar</a>", who thought the writing showed a widely travelled person with an independent mind. She offered David a contract, and David's work began appearing in the publication from March 1949.

David told Scott-James that she planned to publish the articles as a book, and was allowed to retain the copyright by the magazine. Even before all the articles had been published, she had assembled them into a typescript volume called "<a href="A%20Book%20of%20Mediterranean%20Food">A Book of Mediterranean Food</a>"; many of the recipes ignored the restrictions of rationing in favour of authenticity, and in several cases the ingredients were not available in British shops. David submitted her manuscript to a series of publishers, all of whom turned it down. One of them explained that a collection of unconnected recipes needed linking text. David took this advice, but conscious of her inexperience as a writer she kept her own prose short and quoted extensively from established authors whose views on the Mediterranean might carry more weight. She submitted the revised typescript to <a href="John%20Lehmann">John Lehmann</a>, a publisher more associated with poetry than cookery; he accepted it and agreed to an advance payment of £100. "A Book of Mediterranean Food" was published in June 1950.

"A Book of Mediterranean Food" was illustrated by <a href="John%20Minton%20%28artist%29">John Minton</a>; writers including <a href="Cyril%20Ray">Cyril Ray</a> and <a href="John%20Arlott">John Arlott</a> commented that the drawings added to the attractions of the book. Martin Salisbury, the professor of illustration at the <a href="Cambridge%20School%20of%20Art">Cambridge School of Art</a>, writes that Minton's "brilliant, neo-romantic designs perfectly complement the writing". David placed great importance on the illustration of books, and described Minton's jacket design as "stunning". She was especially taken with "his beautiful Mediterranean bay, his tables spread with white cloths and bright fruit" and the way that "pitchers and jugs and bottles of wine could be seen far down the street"; she considered the cover design aided the success of the book, but was less convinced by his black and white drawings.

The book was well received by reviewers. Elizabeth Nicholas, writing for "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>", thought David a "gastronome of rare integrity" who "refuses ... to make any ignoble compromises with expediency". Although John Chandos, writing in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", pointed out that "Let no one eating in London—with whatever abandon—imagine that he is eating Mediterranean food in the absence of Mediterranean earth and air", he finished his review by saying that the book "deserves to become the familiar companion of all who seek uninhibited excitement in the kitchen".

The success of the book led to offers of work from "The Sunday Times"—for which she was paid an advance of 60 <a href="Guinea%20%28coin%29%23Replacement%20by%20the%20pound">guineas</a>—"Go", a travel magazine owned by the newspaper, and "Wine and Food", the journal of the <a href="Wine%20and%20Food%20Society">Wine and Food Society</a>. In August 1950 David and her husband went on their final holiday together with the money from the new contracts, although they had trouble with the car they were using for touring and the holiday was unsuccessful. On her return she invited Felicité, her youngest sister, to move into the top flat in her house. David was a reluctant and unskilful typist—she preferred the feel of writing with a pen—and in exchange for a low rent, Felicité expertly typed her articles and books, and later acted as her principal researcher.

"A Book of Mediterranean Food" was successful enough for Lehmann to commission David to write a sequel, to show the <a href="French%20cuisine">dishes of rural France</a>. This was "<a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23French%20Country%20Cooking%20%281951%29">French Country Cooking</a>", which David finished writing in October 1950. Minton was employed to illustrate the work, and David gave him detailed instructions about the type of drawings; she was more pleased with them than those for her first work. Despite their difficult relationship, David dedicated the book to her mother. Before the book was published, David left England to live for a short time in France. She was motivated by a desire to gain a wider knowledge of life in the French countryside, and to put distance between her and her husband. She left London in March 1951 for <a href="M%C3%A9nerbes">Ménerbes</a>, <a href="Provence">Provence</a>. She spent three months in Provence; although the weather was initially cold and wet, it soon turned warmer and she enjoyed herself so much that she considered buying a house there. In June 1951 she left Ménerbes and travelled to the island of <a href="Capri">Capri</a> to visit Norman Douglas. When she left in late August, she toured briefly around the <a href="Italian%20Riviera">Italian Riviera</a> researching for an article for "Go", before returning to London.

In September, shortly after her return, "French Country Cooking" was published. It was warmly reviewed by critics, although Lucie Marion, writing in "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>", considered that "I cannot think that Mrs David has tried actually to make many of the dishes for which she gives recipes". David wrote to the paper to set the record straight, saying that it would have been "irresponsible and mischievous" if she had not tested them all.

Lehmann and David agreed that her next book should be about <a href="Italian%20cuisine">Italian food</a>; at the time, little was known in Britain about Italian cuisine and interest in the country was on the rise. She received an advance of £300 for the book. She planned to visit Italy for research, and wanted to see Douglas in Capri again, but received news of his death in February 1952, which left her deeply saddened.

David left London in March, arriving in Rome just before the <a href="Easter">Easter</a> celebrations. She toured the country, watching cooks at home and in restaurants and making extensive notes on the regional differences in the cuisine. While in Rome she met the painter <a href="Renato%20Guttuso">Renato Guttuso</a>; deeply impressed by his work, particularly his <a href="still%20life">still life</a>s, she asked if he would illustrate her book. To her surprise he agreed and, while considering the fee of £60 absurdly low, he kept to his word and produced a series of illustrations.

Arriving back in London in October 1952, David began a relationship with an old flame from India, Peter Higgins, a divorced stockbroker; it was the beginning of the happiest period of her life. She spent the following months writing the book, recreating the recipes to work out the correct measurements. She felt less emotionally connected to Italy than with Greece and southern France and found the writing "uncommonly troublesome", although "as recipe after recipe came out ... I realized how much I was learning, and how enormously these dishes were enlarging my own scope and enjoyment". "<a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23Italian%20Food%20%281954%29">Italian Food</a>" was published in November 1954. At the time, many of the ingredients used in the recipes were still difficult to obtain in Britain. Looking back in 1963, David wrote:

In <a href="Soho">Soho</a> but almost nowhere else, such things as Italian "pasta", and Parmesan cheese, olive oil, "salame", and occasionally Parma ham were to be had. ... With southern vegetables such as aubergines, red and green peppers, fennel, the tiny marrows called by the French "courgettes" and in Italy "zucchini", much the same situation prevailed.
"Italian Food" was warmly received by reviewers and the public, and the first print run sold out within three weeks. "<a href="The%20Times%20Literary%20Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</a>"'s reviewer wrote, "More than a collection of recipes, this book is in effect a readable and discerning dissertation on Italian food and regional dishes, and their preparation in the English kitchen." Freya Stark, reviewing for "The Observer", remarked, "Mrs David ... may be counted among the benefactors of humanity." In "The Sunday Times", <a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a> named "Italian Food" as one of the two books that had given him the most pleasure in 1954.

By the time she completed "Italian Food", Lehmann's publishing firm had been closed down by its parent company, and David found herself under contract to Macdonald, another imprint within the same group. She intensely disliked the company and wrote a most unflattering portrait of it in a 1985 article. Disapproving of the approach to her books that the company took, her agent, <a href="Paul%20Scott%20%28novelist%29">Paul Scott</a>, persuaded Macdonald to relinquish their <a href="Option%20contract">option</a> on the next book. David signed instead with the publisher <a href="Museum%20Press">Museum Press</a> for her next book, "<a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23Summer%20Cooking%20%281955%29">Summer Cooking</a>", which was published in 1955.

"Summer Cooking" was illustrated by David's friend, the artist <a href="Adrian%20Daintrey">Adrian Daintrey</a>. He would visit her at home and sketch her in the kitchen while she cooked a lunch for them both. Unconstrained by the geographical agendas of her first three books, David wrote about dishes from Britain, India, <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, Russia, Spain and Turkey, as well as France, Italy and Greece. The book reflected her strong belief in eating food in season; she loved "the pleasure of rediscovering each season's vegetables" and thought it "rather dull to eat the same food all year round". She said that her aim was to put:

emphasis on two aspects of cookery which are increasingly disregarded: the suitability of certain foods to certain times of the year, and the pleasures of eating the vegetables, fruits, poultry, meat or fish which is in season, therefore at its best, most plentiful, and cheapest.

Soon after the publication of "Summer Cooking", David was wooed away from her regular column in "Harper"s by "<a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">Vogue</a>" magazine, which offered her more money and more prominence—a full central page with a continuing column following, and a full page photograph. The new contract meant she also wrote for "Vogue"s sister magazine "<a href="House%20%26amp%3B%20Garden%20%28magazine%29%23U.K.%20edition">House & Garden</a>". <a href="Audrey%20Withers">Audrey Withers</a>, the editor of "Vogue", wanted David to write more personal columns than she had done for "Harper's", and paid her £20 a month for food ingredients and from time to time £100 for research trips to France.

David visited several areas of France, completing her research for her next book, "<a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23French%20Provincial%20Cooking%20%281960%29">French Provincial Cooking</a>", which was "the culmination and synthesis of a decade of work and thought". Published in 1960, it is, according to Cooper in the "<a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>", the book for which she would be best remembered. David's agent negotiated contracts with a new publisher, Michael Joseph, and a new illustrator, Juliet Renny.

Reviews of the new book were as complimentary as those for its predecessors. "The Times Literary Supplement" wrote, ""French Provincial Cooking" needs to be read rather than referred to quickly. It discourses at some length on the type and origin of the dishes popular in various French regions, as well as the culinary terms, herbs and kitchen equipment used in France. But those who can give the extra time to this book will be well repaid by dishes such as "La Bourride de Charles Bérot" and "Cassoulet Colombié"." "The Observer" said that it was difficult to think of any home that could do without the book and called David "a very special kind of genius".

"French Provincial Cooking" was dedicated to Peter Higgins, still her lover. David's estranged husband had lived in Spain since 1953 and, to his wife's embarrassment, he was named in a divorce case which was reported in the gossip column of "The Daily Express". In an interview published in the newspaper, Tony had referred to David as "my ex-wife"; she filed for divorce, and the process was finalised in 1960.

In 1960 David stopped writing for "The Sunday Times", as she was unhappy about editorial interference with her copy; soon afterwards she also left "Vogue" as the change in direction of the magazine did not suit the style of her column. She joined the weekly publications "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>", "<a href="Sunday%20Dispatch">Sunday Dispatch</a>" and "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Telegraph">The Sunday Telegraph</a>". Her books were now reaching a wide public, having been reprinted in paperback by the mass-market publisher <a href="Penguin%20Books">Penguin Books</a>, where they sold more than a million copies between 1955 and 1985. Her work also had an impact on British food culture: the historian <a href="Peter%20Clarke%20%28historian%29">Peter Clarke</a> considers that "The seminal influence of Elizabeth David's "French Provincial Cooking" (1960), with its enormous sales as a Penguin paperback, deserves historical recognition." Cooper considers that David's "professional career was at its height. She was hailed not only as Britain's foremost writer on food and cookery, but as the woman who had transformed the eating habits of middle-class England."

David's private life was less felicitous. In April 1963 her affair with Higgins came to an end when he remarried. For a period she drank too much brandy and resorted too often to sleeping pills. Probably as a result of these factors and overwork, in 1963, when she was 49, David suffered a <a href="cerebral%20haemorrhage">cerebral haemorrhage</a>. She kept the news of the event within her close circle of friends—none of the editors of the publications she worked for were aware of the collapse—as she did not want her reputation as a hard worker to be damaged. She recovered, but her confidence was badly shaken and her sense of taste was temporarily affected; for a period she could not taste salt, or the effect salt had on what she was cooking, but her sense of the smell of frying onions was so enhanced as to be unpleasant for her.

In November 1965, together with four business partners, David opened Elizabeth David Ltd, a shop selling kitchen equipment, at 46 Bourne Street, <a href="Pimlico">Pimlico</a>. The partners were spurred on by the closure of a professional kitchenware shop in Soho on the retirement of its owner, and the recent success of <a href="Terence%20Conran">Terence Conran</a>'s <a href="Habitat%20%28retailer%29">Habitat</a> shops, which sold among much else imported kitchen equipment for which there was evidently a market. Among her customers were <a href="Albert%20Roux">Albert</a> and <a href="Michel%20Roux">Michel Roux</a>, who shopped there for equipment that they would otherwise have had to buy in France.

David, who selected the stock, was uncompromising in her choice of merchandise; despite its large range of kitchen implements, the shop did not stock either wall-mounted <a href="knife%20sharpener">knife sharpener</a>s or <a href="garlic%20press">garlic press</a>es. David wrote an article called "Garlic Presses are Utterly Useless", refused to sell them, and advised customers who demanded them to go elsewhere. Not available elsewhere, by contrast, were booklets by David printed specially for the shop. Some of them were later incorporated into the collections of her essays and articles, "An Omelette and a Glass of Wine" and "Is There a Nutmeg in the House?" The shop was described in "The Observer" as:

... starkly simple. Pyramids of French coffee cups and English pot-bellied iron pans stand in the window. ... Iron shelves hold tin moulds and cutters of every description, glazed and unglazed earthenware pots, bowls and dishes in traditional colours, plain pots and pans in thick aluminium, cast-iron, vitreous enamel and fireproof porcelain, unadorned crockery in classic shapes and neat rows of cooks' knives, spoons and forks.

David reduced her writing commitments to concentrate on running the shop, but contributed some articles to magazines, and began to focus more on English cuisine. She still included many recipes but increasingly wrote about places—markets, "<a href="wikt%3Aauberge">auberges</a>", farms—and people, including profiles of famous chefs and gourmets such as <a href="Marcel%20Boulestin">Marcel Boulestin</a> and <a href="%C3%89douard%20de%20Pomiane">Édouard de Pomiane</a>. In her later articles, she expressed strongly held views on a wide range of subjects; she abominated the word "crispy", demanding to know what it conveyed that "crisp" did not; she confessed to an inability to refill anybody's wineglass until it was empty; she insisted on the traditional form "<a href="Welsh%20rarebit">Welsh rabbit</a>" rather than the modern invention "Welsh rarebit"; she poured scorn on the "<a href="Michelin%20Guide">Guide Michelin's</a>" standards; she deplored "fussy garnish ... distract[ing] from the main flavours"; she inveighed against the "ersatz": "anyone depraved enough to invent a dish consisting of a wedge of steam-heated bread spread with tomato paste and a piece of synthetic Cheddar can call it a pizza."

While running the shop, David wrote another full-length book, "<a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23Spices%2C%20Salt%20and%20Aromatics%20in%20the%20English%20Kitchen%20%281970%29">Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen</a>" (1970). It was her first book in a decade and the first of a projected series on English cookery to be called "English Cooking, Ancient and Modern". She had decided to concentrate on the subject while recuperating from her cerebral haemorrhage in 1963. The book was a departure from her earlier works and contained more <a href="food%20history">food history</a> about what she called "the English preoccupation with the spices and the scents, the fruit, the flavourings, the sources and the condiments of the <a href="orient">orient</a>, <a href="Middle%20East">near</a> and <a href="Far%20East">far</a>".

Elizabeth David Ltd was never more than modestly profitable, but David would not lower her standards in search of a commercial return. A new manager was brought in to run the shop and David fought against many of his changes, but she was always in the minority against her fellow directors. The stress of disagreements over company policy—and the deaths of her sister Diana in March 1971 and her mother in June 1973—contributed to health problems and she suffered from chronic fatigue and swollen, ulcerous legs. Gradually her business partners found her commercial approach unsustainable, and in 1973 she left the company. To her annoyance, the shop continued to trade under her name, although she tried periodically to persuade her former colleagues to change it.

David's second book on English food was "<a href="English%20Bread%20and%20Yeast%20Cookery">English Bread and Yeast Cookery</a>", which she spent five years researching and writing. The work covered the history of bread-making in England and an examination of each ingredient used. She was angered by the standard of bread in Britain and wrote:

What is utterly dismaying is the mess our milling and baking concerns succeed in making with the dearly bought grain that goes into their grist. Quite simply it is wasted on a nation that cares so little about the quality of its bread that it has allowed itself to be mesmerized into buying the equivalent of eight and a quarter million large white factory-made loaves every day of the year.

In 1977 David was badly injured in a car accident—sustaining a fractured left elbow and right wrist, a damaged knee cap and a broken jaw—from which she took a long time to recover. While she was in hospital, "English Bread and Yeast Cookery" was published. Its scholarship won high praise, and <a href="Jane%20Grigson">Jane Grigson</a>, writing in "The Times Literary Supplement", suggested that a copy of the book should be given to every marrying couple, while <a href="Hilary%20Spurling">Hilary Spurling</a>, reviewing for "The Observer", thought that not only was it "a scathing indictment of the British bread industry", but one done with "orderliness, authority, phenomenal scope and fastidious attention to detail".

Some of the research David undertook for "English Bread and Yeast Cookery" was done with <a href="Jill%20Norman">Jill Norman</a>, her friend and publisher. The pair decided that they should produce two further books: "Ice and Ices" and a collection of David's early journalism. Like her book on bread, the scope for "Ice and Ices" grew the more David researched the subject. The compilation of existing essays and press articles took less time, and in 1984 "<a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23An%20Omelette%20and%20a%20Glass%20of%20Wine%20%281984%29">An Omelette and a Glass of Wine</a>" was published, edited by Norman who became David's literary executor and edited further David works after the author's death.

The death in 1986 of her younger sister Felicité, who had lived in the top floor of her house for thirty years, was a severe blow to David. She began to suffer from <a href="Depression%20%28mood%29">depression</a> and went to the doctor after suffering chest pains; he diagnosed <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> and she was hospitalised. After an uncomfortable time over a three-month stay in hospital, where the drugs she was prescribed had side-effects that affected her clarity of thinking, her friend, the wine importer and writer <a href="Gerald%20Asher">Gerald Asher</a>, arranged for her to stay with him in <a href="California">California</a> to recuperate.

David made several visits to California, which she much enjoyed, but her health began to fail. Because her legs had been troublesome for some time, she suffered a succession of falls which resulted in several spells in hospital. She became increasingly reclusive but, despite spending periods in bed at home, she continued to work on "Ice and Ices". She realised that she would not be able to finish the work, and asked Norman to complete it for her. It was published in 1994, under the title "<a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23Harvest%20of%20the%20Cold%20Months%20%281994%29">Harvest of the Cold Months</a>".

In May 1992 David suffered a stroke followed two days later by another, which was fatal; she died at her Chelsea home on 22 May 1992, aged 78. She was buried on 28 May at the family church of <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Peter%20ad%20Vincula%2C%20Folkington">St Peter ad Vincula, Folkington</a>. That September a memorial service was held at <a href="St%20Martin-in-the-Fields">St Martin-in-the-Fields</a>, London, followed by a memorial picnic at the <a href="Institute%20of%20Contemporary%20Arts">Institute of Contemporary Arts</a>. In February 1994 David's possessions were put up for auction. Many of those who attended—and who bid—were fans of David's work, rather than professional dealers. Prue Leith paid £1,100 for David's old kitchen table because it was "where she cooked her omelettes and wrote most of her books". The auction's total receipts were three times the expected value.

From 1950 onwards David was well known for her magazine articles and, in the 1960s and '70s, for her kitchen shop, but her reputation rested and still rests principally on her books. The first five, published between 1950 and 1960, cover the cuisine of continental Europe and beyond. In the 1970s David wrote two books about English cooking. The last of her books published in her lifetime was a collection of previously-printed essays and articles. From the extensive notes and archives left by the author, her literary executor, Jill Norman, edited and completed four more books that David had planned. Six other books published since the author's death have been compilations drawn from her existing works.

On the advice of her publisher, David constructed her early books to intersperse recipes with relevant excerpts of travel writing and scene-painting by earlier writers, and, as her confidence and reputation grew, by herself. "<a href="A%20Book%20of%20Mediterranean%20Food">A Book of Mediterranean Food</a>" (1950) draws on nine authors, from <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a> to <a href="Th%C3%A9ophile%20Gautier">Théophile Gautier</a>, in between eleven sections of recipes. Reviewers commented that David's books possessed literary merit as well as practical instruction.

Some critics, used to more prescriptive cookery writers, thought her approach assumed too much knowledge on the part of the reader. In her view, "The ideal cookery writer is one who makes his readers want to cook as well as telling them how it is done; he should leave something, not too much perhaps, but a little, unsaid: people must make their own discoveries, use their own intelligence, otherwise they will be deprived of part of the fun." In "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" <a href="Craig%20Claiborne">Craig Claiborne</a> wrote admiringly of David, but remarked that because she assumed her readers already knew the basics of cooking she would be "valued more by those with a serious regard for food than by those with a casual interest". The writer <a href="Julian%20Barnes">Julian Barnes</a> commented that as an amateur cook he found David's terse instructions intimidating: of a recipe in "<a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23Italian%20Food%20%281954%29">Italian Food</a>" he wrote, "E.D.'s first sentence reads like this: 'Melt 1½ lbs (675 g) chopped and skinned tomatoes in olive oil' ... "Melt? Melt a tomato?" ... Could it be that Elizabeth David was too good a writer to be a food writer?". A later cook, <a href="Tom%20Parker%20Bowles">Tom Parker Bowles</a>, observes, "You don't turn to Elizabeth David for nannying, step-by-step instruction, or precise amounts and timing. She assumes you know the basics, and is a writer who offers inspiration, and wonderful, opinionated prose. Her recipes are timeless, and all her books wonderful works of reference (and tirelessly researched) as well as beautiful reads."

The eight books and eight booklets by David published in her lifetime cover the food of France; Italy; the rest of the Mediterranean and beyond, into Asia; and England.

Two of David's best-known books focus on the cuisine of France: "<a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23French%20Country%20Cooking%20%281951%29">French Country Cooking</a>" (1951) and "<a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23French%20Provincial%20Cooking%20%281960%29">French Provincial Cooking</a>" (1960); France features prominently, though not exclusively, in another two: "A Book of Mediterranean Food" (1950) and "<a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23Summer%20Cooking%20%281955%29">Summer Cooking</a>" (1955). She set the pattern for her books by grouping recipes by category, with sections linked by her chosen passages from literature. In her first book, "Mediterranean Food", David presented chapters on soups; eggs and luncheon dishes; fish; meat; substantial dishes; poultry and game; vegetables; cold food and salads; sweets; jams, chutneys and preserves; and sauces. She broadly followed this pattern in her next four books.
David's view on the place of French cooking in the hierarchy of world cuisine is set out in her introduction to "French Country Cooking": "French regional and peasant cookery ... at its best, is the most delicious in the world; cookery which uses raw materials to the greatest advantage without going to the absurd lengths of the complicated and so-called "Haute Cuisine"." She was a firm believer in the traditional French approach to buying and preparing food:

Though not neglecting elaborate dishes—she devoted six pages to the choice of ingredients for and cooking of <a href="pot-au-feu">pot-au-feu</a> or lièvre à la Royale (a <a href="salmis">salmis</a> of <a href="hare">hare</a>)—David regarded simple everyday cooking as in some ways more demanding, and gave many recipes for "the kind of food which is eaten frequently in thrifty French households, and it is very good".

David emphasised the importance to cooks of careful and knowledgeable shopping for ingredients. She wrote chapters about French markets such as those at <a href="Cavaillon">Cavaillon</a>, <a href="Yvetot">Yvetot</a>, <a href="Montpellier">Montpellier</a>, <a href="Martigues">Martigues</a> and <a href="Valence%2C%20Dr%C3%B4me">Valence</a>. Despite a widespread perception that her view of food was essentially Mediterranean, "French Provincial Cooking", by far her longest book to date, surveyed the cuisine of France from <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> and the <a href="%C3%8Ele-de-France">Île-de-France</a> to <a href="Alsace">Alsace</a>, <a href="Burgundy">Burgundy</a>, the <a href="Loire-Atlantique">Loire</a>, <a href="Gironde">Bordeaux</a> and the <a href="French%20Basque%20Country">Basque Country</a>, as well as the south. Looking at the entire field of cookery books, <a href="Jane%20Grigson">Jane Grigson</a> regarded this as "the best and most stimulating of them all".

Unlike its two predecessors, "Mediterranean Food" and "French Country Cooking", David's "<a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23Italian%20Food%20%281954%29">Italian Food</a>" (1954) drew little from anything she had already written. She spent many months in Italy researching it before starting work on the manuscript. With two successful books already published, David felt less in need of extracts from earlier writers to bolster her prose, and interspersed the recipes with her own essays and introductions to the various sections. The book begins with a chapter on "The Italian store cupboard", giving British cooks, who at that time were generally unacquainted with most of Italy's cuisine and methods, an insight into Italian herbs, spices, tinned, bottled or dried staples including anchovies, tuna, "", <a href="prosciutto">prosciutto</a>, and chickpeas, and Italian essentials such as garlic and olive oil, both seldom seen in Britain in the early 1950s. The rest of the book follows the basic pattern of the earlier works, with chapters on soups, fish, meat, vegetables and sweets, with the addition of extra subjects relevant to Italian food, pasta asciuta, ravioli and <a href="gnocchi">gnocchi</a>, rice, and Italian wine.

In addition to those in "Italian Food", there are many Italian recipes and descriptions of the land and the people in David's other works. The first recipe in her first book, "Mediterranean Food"—soupe au Pistou—is of Genoese origin. Also in that book are recipes for bocconcini, <a href="osso%20bucco">osso bucco</a>, and several Italian pasta and chicken dishes. Among the recipes in "Summer Cooking" is peperonata (<a href="pimentos">pimentos</a> or <a href="Bell%20pepper">sweet peppers</a> cooked with tomatoes in olive oil and butter) which was reprinted as the title article in a later selection from David's works. In "<a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23An%20Omelette%20and%20a%20Glass%20of%20Wine%20%281984%29">An Omelette and a Glass of Wine</a>", David printed Italian recipes including soups and omelettes made with <a href="hops">hops</a> (zuppa di lupolli and frittata con i loertis). Also in that book are substantial essays on Italian people and places. "<a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23Is%20There%20a%20Nutmeg%20in%20the%20House%3F%20%282000%29">Is There a Nutmeg in the House?</a>" includes a six-page article on vegetable dishes from <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a>, and another of similar length on the variations of pizza in Italy and beyond.

When David's first book, "Mediterranean Food", was published in 1950 the British public was still enduring food rationing after the Second World War. Her evocation of the everyday plenty and excellence of <a href="Mediterranean%20cuisine">Mediterranean food</a> was revelatory, and although she did not reach a wide public until cheap paperback editions of her books came out in the mid 1950s, reviewers immediately spotted her importance.

In the introduction to "Mediterranean Food" David set out her basic premise: "The cooking of the Mediterranean shores, endowed with all the natural resources, the colour and flavour of the South, is a blend of tradition and brilliant improvisation. The Latin genius flashes from the kitchen pans. It is honest cooking, too; none of the sham Grande Cuisine of the International Palace Hotel." She conceded, nevertheless, that the food culture of the Mediterranean was not exclusively Latin, and flowered in "the mainland of Greece and the much-disputed territories of Syria, the Lebanon, Constantinople and Smyrna". She described the ever-recurring elements in the food throughout these countries as:

In her other books David gives recipes from around the Mediterranean, including <a href="gazpacho">gazpacho</a> and <a href="tortilla">tortilla</a>s from Spain; <a href="dolmas">dolmádés</a>, and eggs with <a href="skordalia">skordalia</a> from Greece, mutton-stuffed aubergines, yoghurt soup, and a stew of carrots and rice from Turkey; and a Syrian dish of chicken with almonds and cream. From further afield she includes Mauritian prawn chutney; iced cucumber and beetroot soup from Russia; a Persian <a href="Maqluba">maqlub</a> of aubergines, rice and mutton; Sikh kebabs and <a href="garam%20masala">garam masala</a> from India; and Armenian pizza, claimed to be older than the Italian version.

In a 2012 survey for the Australasian Universities Language and Literature Association, Carody Culver writes, "It is David's language, particularly her use of description that most strongly enforces the narrative and literary quality of "Mediterranean Food". Her imagery, anecdotes, and literary quotes transform her recipes into stories of experience and memory. ... Ingredients and dishes are not just given as part of a list of instructions, but represented as part of a specific culture."

"<a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23Spices%2C%20Salt%20and%20Aromatics%20in%20the%20English%20Kitchen%20%281970%29">Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen</a>" (1970) and "<a href="English%20Bread%20and%20Yeast%20Cookery">English Bread and Yeast Cookery</a>" (1977) include a few British dishes from outside England, such as Scottish <a href="Arbroath%20smokie">Arbroath smokie</a>s and <a href="Bannock%20%28food%29">bannocks</a>; and Welsh salt duck and <a href="bara%20brith">bara brith</a>. David, like many of her generation and class, used the terms "England" and "English" to refer to the whole of Britain.

Some writers have believed David neglected the <a href="English%20cuisine">cooking of her own country</a> in favour of Mediterranean cuisine. In the humorous magazine "<a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>", <a href="Humphrey%20Lyttelton">Humphrey Lyttelton</a> held that she preferred "inaccessible and often indigestible "saucissons"" to "the splendid Cumberland sausage". More recently a British journalist, <a href="Tim%20Hayward">Tim Hayward</a>, accused her of "wide-eyed romantic twaddle", excessively focused on France and the Mediterranean. Chaney comments that when "Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen" was published in 1970, some of David's most ardent admirers were taken aback to find her extolling the British culinary tradition, "at its best ... as rich and rewarding as that of the Mediterranean". Cooper writes that although the change of focus from French and Mediterranean food to English surprised the public, David had been moving towards it for some time.

David treated her English topics in considerable detail: "Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen" is longer than "Mediterranean Food", "French Country Cooking" or "Summer Cooking". She intended it to be the first in a series of three or even five books on English cookery: "It depends how much time I have ... Later volumes will deal with bread, yeast, cakes, creams and cheeses and egg dishes, and meat and game". They were never written, except for "English Bread and Yeast Cookery", which is by nearly 100 pages the longest of all David's works.

David consciously followed in the path of <a href="Hilda%20Leyel">Hilda Leyel</a> and <a href="Dorothy%20Hartley">Dorothy Hartley</a> in researching British ingredients and dishes. Like them, she looked back into regional history to find what she saw as "the traditions of a culture rooted to the soil" before "the ravages of the Industrial Revolution". She did not romanticise Britain's culinary past: "Farm and factory labourers, artisans and clerical workers, still lived on a very restricted diet ... their cooking facilities were so primitive and their equipment so scanty that only the most basic forms of cookery could be attempted". But her constant benchmarks were honest ingredients and uncomplicated cooking. She condemned—and explained the alternatives to—the artificial, the ersatz, the "notorious <a href="Chorleywood%20bread%20process">Chorleywood</a> bread", and "all synthetic aids to flavouring ... Nobody has ever been able to find out why the English regard a glass of wine added to a soup or stew as a reckless extravagance and at the same time spend pounds on bottled sauces, gravy powders, soup cubes, ketchups and artificial flavourings".

Both the English books are in two parts. The first section is historical, putting the subject into context for the modern reader. In "Spices, Salt and Aromatics" David writes about the background of the herbs and spices and condiments that came into use in British kitchens over the previous centuries, and sketches the history of their adoption from Asia and continental Europe. "The Times Literary Supplement" called this part of the book "as difficult to put down as a good thriller". David follows a similar path in "English Bread and Yeast Cookery"; reviewing the book <a href="Hilary%20Spurling">Hilary Spurling</a> wrote that it contained "a history of virtually every development since Stone Age crops and querns". The second, longer, sections of the two books contain the recipes and descriptions.

Although David had drawn on her many magazine articles for material in her earlier books, "An Omelette and Glass of Wine" (1984) was the first straightforward anthology of her work. Compiled with the assistance of Jill Norman, it consists of David's selections from her essays and articles published since 1949.

The article from which the book takes its title is an essay on "the almost primitive and elemental meal evoked by the words: 'Let's just have an omelette and a glass of wine. Among the other subjects are profiles of people including Norman Douglas, <a href="Marcel%20Boulestin">Marcel Boulestin</a>, <a href="Mrs%20Beeton">Mrs Beeton</a>, and "A gourmet in Edwardian London", Colonel <a href="Nathaniel%20Newnham-Davis">Nathaniel Newnham-Davis</a>. Several sections are devoted to descriptions of the markets of French country towns, and unpretentious restaurants and hotels in France. There are articles on lemons, potted meat, mayonnaise, pizza, syllabubs, truffles, and on the cuisines of Spain and Morocco. For most of the articles David provided either an introduction or an afternote, or both.

David had intended to publish a second such volume, and eight years after the author's death, Norman, her literary executor, published a sequel, "Is There a Nutmeg in the House?" (2000). Like its predecessor, it was drawn from magazine articles, essays and other earlier writings, to which Norman added articles written by David in the 1980s. The first section of the book is a short autobiographical piece, a rarity from David, who guarded her privacy carefully. David's interest in the historical aspects of cuisine is given scope in essays on the history of <a href="Oxo%20%28food%29">Oxo</a> and <a href="Bovril">Bovril</a>, <a href="Alexis%20Soyer">Alexis Soyer</a> and the potato. Articles aimed at the domestic cook include "Do not Despair over Rice", "Making Ice Cream", and one propounding a view for which she was famous: "Garlic Presses are Utterly Useless". "The New York Times" called the book "this very appealing, completely absorbing miscellany. ... This is a book good enough to eat—and, in a way, you can."

David wrote eight booklets on individual topics. The first two, "The Use of Wine in Fine Cooking" (1950) and "The Use of Wine in Italian Cooking" (1952), were commissioned and published by the wine merchants Saccone and Speed. David reused the first as a chapter in "French Country Cooking".

For her kitchen equipment shop, David wrote "Dried Herbs, Aromatics and Condiments" (1967); "English Potted Meats and Fish Pastes" (1968); "The Baking of an English Loaf" (1969); "Syllabubs and Fruit Fools" (1969), and "Green Pepper Berries" (1972). Some of the content was taken from her previously-published magazine articles, and some was further reused and expanded in her later books.

David's last booklet was "Cooking with Le Creuset" (1989) written for the French manufacturers of <a href="Le%20Creuset">Le Creuset</a> cooking ware.

In addition to "Is There a Nutmeg in the House?" three further books planned by David were completed and edited by Norman after the author died.

<a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23Harvest%20of%20the%20Cold%20Months%20%281994%29">"Harvest of the Cold Months"</a> (1994) is subtitled "A social history of ice and ices". David had been working on it intermittently for several years before her last illnesses. The book traces the history of ice in the cuisines of Europe from mediaeval times, when it had to be brought from the mountains and kept in ice houses. "The Independent"s reviewer described it as "not a cookery book but an awe-inspiring feat of detective scholarship ... sumptuous and stately". Reviewing the book in "The Times", <a href="Nigella%20Lawson">Nigella Lawson</a> wrote that although it deserved a place on the shelves of anyone who cared about food, it revealed a waning of the author's energies, and "lacks her customary, high-spirited, if fierce, readability".

<a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23South%20Wind%20Through%20the%20Kitchen%20%281997%29">"South Wind Through the Kitchen"</a> (1997) was the completion of one of the projects of David's later years on which she worked with Norman: a single-volume collection of the best of her extensive writings. Norman invited chefs, writers and David's friends to choose their favourite of her articles and recipes. Many of the contributors, such as the chef <a href="Simon%20Hopkinson">Simon Hopkinson</a>, contributed an introduction or afterword to the pieces they chose. The extracts and recipes are taken from all David's books published by 1996. There are more than 200 recipes, organised in the customary way with sections on courses and ingredients—eggs and cheese, fish and shellfish, meat, poultry and game, vegetables, pasta, pulses and grains, sauces, sweet dishes and cakes, preserves, and bread—interspersed, as in David's earlier works, with articles and essays. The title of the book comes from an essay published in 1964 and reprinted in "An Omelette and a Glass of Wine", and is a reference to "<a href="South%20Wind%20%28novel%29">South Wind</a>", the best-known novel by David's mentor Norman Douglas.

The last of the books planned by David was <a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23Elizabeth%20David%27s%20Christmas%20%282003%29">"Elizabeth David's Christmas"</a> (2003). She and Norman had discussed such a book as early as the 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out the author's papers that David had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. The Christmas recipes David had most often been asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from "Mediterranean Food", "French Provincial Cooking", and "Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen", and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page work. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, cakes and drinks. The book reprints one of David's most quoted sentences, first printed in "Vogue" in 1959, and included in "Is there a Nutmeg in the House" in 2000: "If I had my way—and I shan't—my Christmas Day eating and drinking would consist of an omelette and cold ham and a nice bottle of wine at lunchtime, and a smoked salmon sandwich with a glass of champagne on a tray in bed in the evening."

Between 1995 and 2011 Penguin Books issued four paperback selections from David's books: <a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23I%27ll%20be%20with%20You%20in%20the%20Squeezing%20of%20a%20Lemon%20%281995%29">"I'll be with You in the Squeezing of a Lemon"</a> (1995), <a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23Peperonata%20and%20Other%20Italian%20Dishes%20%281996%29">"Peperonata and Other Italian Dishes"</a> (1996), <a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23Of%20Pageants%20and%20Picnics%20%282005%29">"Of Pageants and Picnics"</a> (2005), and <a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23A%20Taste%20of%20the%20Sun%20%282011%29">"A Taste of the Sun"</a> (2011).
Two further hardback selections of David's writings were published, with Norman as editor. <a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23At%20Elizabeth%20David%27s%20Table%20%282010%29">"At Elizabeth David's Table"</a> (2010) was published to mark the 60th anniversary of David's first book. With prefatory contributions from several prominent British chefs including Hopkinson, <a href="Hugh%20Fearnley-Whittingstall">Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</a>, <a href="Rose%20Gray">Rose Gray</a> and <a href="Jamie%20Oliver">Jamie Oliver</a>, it comprises recipes and essays from David's previously published works. There are twelve chapters, covering the various courses of a dinner from soups to desserts, and other topics such as baking, cooking "fast and fresh", and David's descriptions of French and Italian markets. <a href="Elizabeth%20David%20bibliography%23Elizabeth%20David%20on%20Vegetables%20%282013%29">"Elizabeth David on Vegetables"</a> (2013) was drawn principally from "Mediterranean Food, Italian Food, French Provincial Cooking" and "An Omelette and a Glass of Wine". There are sections on soups; small dishes; salads; pasta; gnocchi and <a href="polenta">polenta</a>; rice; beans and lentils; main dishes; breads; and desserts.

David won the <a href="Glenfiddich%20Food%20and%20Drink%20Awards">Glenfiddich</a> Writer of the Year award in 1978 for "English Bread and Yeast Cookery". She was also awarded honorary doctorates by the Universities of <a href="University%20of%20Essex">Essex</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Bristol">Bristol</a>, and the award of a <a href="Order%20of%20Agricultural%20Merit">Chevalier de l'Ordre du Mérite Agricole</a>. She was appointed Officer of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Order of the British Empire</a> (OBE) in 1976 and promoted to Commander of the Order (CBE) in 1986. The honour that most pleased her, however, was being made a Fellow of the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Literature">Royal Society of Literature</a> in 1982 in recognition of her skills as a writer.

In 2012, to mark the <a href="Diamond%20Jubilee%20of%20Elizabeth%20II">Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II</a>, David was chosen by BBC Radio 4 as one of the 60 Britons who have been most influential during the 60 years of the Queen's reign. In 2013 her portrait was one of a series of first-class stamps issued to celebrate the centenary of ten "Great Britons". In 2016 an <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a> was erected on her former home at 24 Halsey Street, Chelsea, where she had lived for 45 years; she was the first food writer to receive this form of recognition.

The obituaries for David were warm and full of praise for her work and legacy. In "The Guardian", the food writer Christopher Driver called her "this century's most influential cookery writer and scholar in English", while the obituarist for "The Times" wrote:

Elizabeth David was the doyenne of English cookery writers. She influenced the generations who came after her, whether they, too, were intending to be culinary experts or merely taking a well-thumbed Elizabeth David Penguin from the kitchen shelf for the next day's dinner party. "Elizabeth David says ..." was the regular way of resolving how much spice—and which spices—should be added to a stew and how much garlic should be put in a dressing. At its best, her prose was as precise as her instructions, unlike that of some of her predecessors who sometimes wrapped up advice on what to do in the kitchen with impenetrable sentences. She was a pleasure to read, a stylist of true distinction. Perhaps only in Britain would she have been classified as a "food writer", too often rather a damning phrase. Elizabeth David combined a scholar's feeling for history with the traveller-aesthete's gift of conveying a sense of place.

David's writing influenced the cultural approach of the British towards food. According to the food journalist <a href="Joanna%20Blythman">Joanna Blythman</a>, she "performed both a cultural and gastronomic miracle in post-war Britain by introducing the nation to a vision of fresh Continental food", while the writer <a href="Rose%20Prince%20%28writer%29">Rose Prince</a> considers that David "changed for ever the way British people cook". Janet Floyd, professor of American Literature at <a href="King%27s%20College%20London">King's College London</a>, argues that David was not a driver of change, but came to epitomise that change. The literary historian Nicola Humble observes that "the food revolution of the post-war years would probably have happened without Elizabeth David, though in her absence it would have happened very differently".

Floyd comments that David "showed little interest in appealing to or engaging with an audience outside a social elite"; Cooper addresses the same point, although highlights a positive review of "French Provincial Cooking" in "<a href="Morning%20Star%20%28British%20newspaper%29">The Daily Worker</a>"—a newspaper that represented the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">Communist Party of Great Britain</a>—as evidence that David had a broader readership than some give her credit for.

David has appeared in fictional form at least twice. In 2000 a novel, "Lunch with Elizabeth David" by Roger Williams, was published by Carroll & Graf, and in 2006 the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> broadcast "", a film starring <a href="Catherine%20McCormack">Catherine McCormack</a> as David and <a href="Greg%20Wise">Greg Wise</a> as Peter Higgins. In 1998 Lisa Chaney published a biography of David; the journalist <a href="Paul%20Levy%20%28journalist%29">Paul Levy</a> found it "hasty, botched", although in "The New York Times" Laura Shapiro considered it "comprehensive". The following year an authorised biography, "Writing at the Kitchen Table", was published by <a href="Artemis%20Cooper">Artemis Cooper</a>. She also wrote the entry for David in the "Dictionary of National Biography" in 2004 (updated in 2011). David's papers are at the <a href="Schlesinger%20Library">Schlesinger Library</a> at the <a href="Radcliffe%20Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study</a>, <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>.

David's passion for cookware proved influential on the style of the time. Conran acknowledges that her work "formed an important part of the learning process that led to Habitat", and the success of the Elizabeth David Ltd outlet contributed to a demand for French provincial cookware. David went to great lengths to ensure the illustrators of her books got small details right—in a draft introduction for "French Provincial Cooking", she wrote: "I was anxious that such details should be put on record because some of these regional cooking pots are already becoming very hard to find in France, so that in some sense Juliet Renny's drawings constitute a little historical record in their own right."

David's ongoing campaign against the mass-production and standardisation of food was ahead of her time, although Chaney describes her thoughts as "instinctive and unarticulated". One of David's passions, the premise of buying local produce in season and preparing it simply, is a message continued by Stein, Slater and Fearnley-Whittingstall.

Fellow cooks and chefs have acknowledged David's influence on their own and their colleagues' works; her contemporary Jane Grigson wrote in 1967 "Nobody can produce a cookery book these days without a deep appreciation of Elizabeth David's work." Grigson later wrote:

Basil was no more than the name of bachelor uncles, courgette was printed in italics as an alien word, and few of us knew how to eat spaghetti or pick a globe artichoke to pieces. ... Then came Elizabeth David like sunshine, writing with brief elegance about good food, that is, about food well contrived, well cooked. She made us understand that we could do better with what we had.

<a href="Rick%20Stein">Rick Stein</a>, a more recent chef, says that David was such an influence on his early work that he used one of Minton's illustrations from "A Book of Mediterranean Food" on his menus when he first opened a restaurant. Others, including <a href="Nigel%20Slater">Nigel Slater</a>, <a href="Gordon%20Ramsay">Gordon Ramsay</a>, Jamie Oliver, <a href="Prue%20Leith">Prue Leith</a> and <a href="Clarissa%20Dickson%20Wright">Clarissa Dickson Wright</a>, have been influenced by David; Dickson Wright said that David "taught me that food is more than cooking; it is poetry and passion as well. She also taught me never to settle for culinary second-best". Norman quotes Leith as being quite shocked when she asked students at a catering college how many of them had read David's books, and not a single one raised a hand. "But the books do sell—I see the royalty statements—and you see her influence in the cooking of <a href="Jeremy%20Lee">Jeremy Lee</a>, Shaun Hill and <a href="Rowley%20Leigh">Rowley Leigh</a>".

David's influence travelled further afield than Britain, and <a href="Marian%20Burros">Marian Burros</a>, in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote in 1992 that "Dozens of the young chefs who have brought glory to American cooking over the last two decades are indebted to Mrs David." The same year, the journalist Susan Parsons wrote in "<a href="The%20Canberra%20Times">The Canberra Times</a>" that "Every leading Australian chef over the age of 40 pays tribute to Elizabeth David as a major influence on their approach to food". More modern Australian cooks, such as <a href="Kylie%20Kwong">Kylie Kwong</a>, have also cited David as a continuing influence on their work.

Michael Bateman, the food critic for "The Independent", considered that David "will be remembered as a far greater influence on English food than Mrs Beeton"; the writer <a href="Auberon%20Waugh">Auberon Waugh</a> wrote that if asked to name the woman who had brought about the greatest improvement in English life in the 20th century, "my vote would go to Elizabeth David." David's biographer Cooper concludes her "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography" article thus:

Phillip Davey

Phillip Davey, (10 October 1896 – 21 December 1953) was an <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20Victoria%20Cross%20recipients">Australian recipient</a> of the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, the highest award for <a href="courage">gallantry</a> in battle that can be awarded to a member of the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian armed forces</a>. Davey enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> in December 1914, and joined his unit, the <a href="10th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">10th Battalion</a>, on the island of <a href="Lemnos">Lemnos</a> on 10 April 1915. Along with his battalion, he <a href="Landing%20at%20Anzac%20Cove">landed at Anzac Cove</a>, <a href="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a>, on 25 April. He fought at Anzac until he was evacuated sick in early November, returning to Australia the following January.

Davey embarked for England in June 1916, and rejoined his battalion on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in October. In January 1918 he was awarded the <a href="Military%20Medal">Military Medal</a> for bravery in rescuing a wounded man under fire. He was promoted to <a href="corporal">corporal</a> in April. In the lead-up to the capture of <a href="Merris">Merris</a> in June, he killed an eight-man German machine-gun crew, saving his <a href="platoon">platoon</a> from annihilation, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. During this action he was severely wounded. He returned to Australia to be discharged, and was employed by <a href="South%20Australian%20Railways">South Australian Railways</a> over many years before dying in 1953, having suffered for years with <a href="bronchitis">bronchitis</a> and <a href="Chronic%20obstructive%20pulmonary%20disease">emphysema</a>.

His medals are displayed in the Hall of Valour at the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a>.

Phillip Davey was born on 10 October 1896 at <a href="Unley%2C%20South%20Australia">Unley, South Australia</a>, to William George Davey, a carpenter, and his wife Elizabeth O'Neill; he was one of five sons of the couple who would see service in World War I. Phillip attended Flinders Street Model School and <a href="Goodwood%20Primary%20School">Goodwood Public School</a>. After his schooling, he was involved in <a href="Borehole">well boring</a> and <a href="Opal">opal mining</a> in <a href="Central%20Australia">Central Australia</a>; at the outbreak of war he was a horse driver.

On 22 December 1914, aged 18, Davey enlisted as a <a href="private%20%28rank%29">private</a> in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) and was posted to the 2nd reinforcements to the <a href="10th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">10th Battalion</a>. He sailed for Egypt from <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> on 2 February 1915. He joined the <a href="3rd%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">3rd Brigade</a>'s 10th Battalion on board the in the port of <a href="Mudros">Mudros</a> on the island of <a href="Lemnos">Lemnos</a> in the northeastern <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> on 10 April 1915. The 3rd Brigade had been chosen as the <a href="covering%20force">covering force</a> for the <a href="landing%20at%20Anzac%20Cove">landing at Anzac Cove</a>, <a href="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a>, on 25 April. The brigade embarked on the battleship and the destroyer , and after transferring to strings of rowing-boats initially towed by <a href="Pinnace%20%28ship%27s%20boat%29%23Steam%20pinnace">steam pinnaces</a>, the battalion began rowing ashore at about 4:30am.

Davey participated in the heavy fighting at the landing and subsequent trench warfare defending the <a href="beachhead">beachhead</a>. After several bouts of illness, he was evacuated to Egypt with <a href="Typhoid%20fever">enteric fever</a> in early November. In January 1916 he was repatriated to Australia to recover his health. He re-embarked at Melbourne in June, arrived in the United Kingdom in August, and embarked for France the following month. While he had been recuperating, the infantry formations of the AIF had been withdrawn from Gallipoli to Egypt, then transferred to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in France and Belgium. Davey rejoined the 10th Battalion in early October.

From the time Davey returned, the 10th Battalion rotated through front-line, reserve, training and <a href="Fatigue%20duty">fatigue duties</a>, mainly in the <a href="Somme%20%28river%29">Somme river</a> sector. In February 1917, it participated in an operation at Le Barque, southwest of <a href="Bapaume">Bapaume</a>. On 15 March, Davey was accidentally wounded by a <a href="hand%20grenade">hand grenade</a> while the battalion was in camp, but returned to duty less than a month later, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29">Battle of Arras</a>. He was promoted to <a href="lance%20corporal">lance corporal</a> in early May, at which time the battalion was fighting in a support role at <a href="Bullecourt">Bullecourt</a>. In September, the battalion was committed to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Menin%20Road">Battle of Menin Road</a> at <a href="Battle%20of%20Polygon%20Wood">Polygon Wood</a>. The following month Davey was <a href="Chemical%20warfare">gassed</a> while the 10th Battalion was relieving troops in the front-line near Westhoek Ridge; he returned to his unit in early November.

Through the winter of 1917/1918, the battalion rotated through various duties, in and out of the front-line. On 3 January 1918, Davey rescued a wounded soldier under heavy fire, and was awarded the <a href="Military%20Medal">Military Medal</a> for bravery in the field. The recommendation read: 

Davey was promoted to <a href="corporal">corporal</a> on 24 April 1918, and that night the 10th Battalion conducted an operation near <a href="M%C3%A9teren">Méteren</a>. The following month he was detached to <a href="Tidworth">Tidworth</a> in England as an instructor, but returned to his unit at his own request on 23 June. Five days later, he was with his battalion during a "<a href="peaceful%20penetration">peaceful penetration</a>" operation near <a href="Merris">Merris</a>. His actions in single-handedly eliminating a German machine gun post resulted in the award of the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, the highest award for <a href="courage">gallantry</a> in battle that can be awarded to a member of the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian armed forces</a>. The citation read: 

Davey's platoon was soon relieved by a reserve platoon that re-established the post. The 10th Battalion operation had seized of the German front line, along with thirty-five prisoners, six machine guns and two "<a href="Minenwerfer">Minenwerfer</a>" trench mortars, for the loss of fifty casualties. Davey had sustained wounds to his back, abdomen and legs, and was evacuated to England. After he had recovered sufficiently he received his Victoria Cross at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> on 12 September, and was then embarked to return to Australia the following month. He was discharged from the AIF on 24 February 1919. A fellow VC recipient, <a href="Arthur%20Blackburn">Arthur Blackburn</a> later said, "I think all agree that no VC was ever better earned than Phil Davey's". Four of Davey's brothers had also enlisted, Claude, Richard, Joseph and Arthur, one of them reportedly being under the age of fifteen when he joined up. His brothers Claude and Richard were also awarded the Military Medal during World War I, Claude being killed in action in 1917.

After returning from the war, Davey worked for <a href="South%20Australian%20Railways">South Australian Railways</a> as a labourer and linesman over three periods between 1926 and 1946: 27 April 1926 to 4 October 1938; 6 March 1939 to 12 February 1942; and 17 December 1943 to 22 February 1946. He married Eugene Agnes Tomlinson on 25 August 1928; they had no children. After suffering for many years with <a href="bronchitis">bronchitis</a> and <a href="Chronic%20obstructive%20pulmonary%20disease">emphysema</a>, Davey died on 21 December 1953 of a <a href="coronary%20occlusion">coronary occlusion</a>. He was buried at the <a href="West%20Terrace%20Cemetery">West Terrace AIF Cemetery</a>, Adelaide, with full military honours.

As well as the Victoria Cross, Military Medal, <a href="1914%E2%80%9315%20Star">1914–15 Star</a>, <a href="British%20War%20Medal">British War Medal</a> and <a href="Victory%20Medal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Victory Medal</a> for his service in World War I, Davey was later awarded the <a href="King%20George%20VI%20Coronation%20Medal">King George VI Coronation Medal</a> and <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II%20Coronation%20Medal">Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal</a>. His medal set, including his Victoria Cross, was presented to the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> in 1967, and is displayed in the Hall of Valour.

Thomas Crisp

<a href="Skipper%20%28boating%29">Skipper</a> Thomas Crisp <a href="Victoria%20Cross">VC</a>, <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">DSC</a>, <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Reserve">RNR</a> (28 April 1876 – 15 August 1917) was an <a href="England">English</a> posthumous recipient of the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>. Crisp, in civilian life a commercial fisherman operating from <a href="Lowestoft">Lowestoft</a> in <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>, earned his award after being killed during the defence of his vessel, the armed naval <a href="Smack%20%28ship%29">smack</a> His Majesty's Smack "Nelson", in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> against an attack from a German <a href="submarine">submarine</a> in 1917.

Thomas Crisp's self–sacrifice in the face of this "unequal struggle" was used by the government to bolster morale during some of the toughest days of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> for Britain, the summer and autumn of 1917, during which Britain was suffering heavy losses at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Battle of Passchendaele</a>. His exploit was read aloud by <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a> in the <a href="Houses%20of%20Parliament">Houses of Parliament</a> and made headline news for nearly a week.

Thomas Crisp was born into a family of shipwrights and fishermen in <a href="Lowestoft">Lowestoft</a>, one of ten children to William and Mary Anne Crisp. Although his father was the owner of a successful boatbuilding firm and thus could afford an education for his children, Thomas did not enjoy school, instead showing a "marked preference for quayside adventure to school routine". Leaving school, Thomas took to the sea, spending several years as a <a href="herring">herring</a> fisherman before joining a <a href="fishing%20trawler">fishing trawler</a> out of Lowestoft. He was a natural to the work, being a remarkably good sailor, but tired of it quickly and joined the Atlantic steamship SS "Mobile", becoming her quartermaster and making several trans–Atlantic voyages.

In 1895, aged 19, he met and married Harriet Elizabeth Alp and settled with her at 48 Staithe Road in <a href="Burgh%20St.%20Peter">Burgh St. Peter</a> near Lowestoft, where they had two sons and a daughter, including Thomas Crisp Jr., who would be with his father on the day he won the Victoria Cross. Establishing himself as a fisherman, Thomas Sr. achieved his mate and then skipper qualifications, entitling him to captain a fishing vessel sailing from the port. In 1902 he was taken on by Chambers, one of the largest boat owning families in Lowestoft, to crew and then captain their <a href="ketch">ketch</a> "George Borrow", in which he remained for thirteen years. In 1907 the family moved to Lowestoft while Crisp continued his work at sea, proving one of the most popular fishing captains in Lowestoft and joined on his ketch by his son in 1913.

When the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> began in July 1914, Crisp was at sea. Unaware of the outbreak of war, he remained in the North Sea for several days, and was surprised on his return to learn that enemy submarines were expected off the port at any moment. When this threat failed to materialise, Thomas Crisp returned to fishing, considered too old for military service and in an occupation vital to Britain's food supplies. In late September, "George Borrow" passed , and just hours before they were all sunk with over a thousand lives by German <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a> . Tom Crisp Jr. later wrote of finding bodies in their fishing nets for weeks afterwards.

In the spring of 1915, Tom Crisp Jr. left the vessel to join the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. A few weeks later the U–boat threat expected so many months before arrived, as submarines surfaced among the undefended fishing fleets and used dynamite to destroy dozens of them after releasing the crews in small boats. This offensive was part of a wider German strategy to denude Britain of food supplies and took a heavy toll on the fishing fleets of the North Sea. "George Borrow" was among the victims, sunk in August, although it is not known if Tom Crisp (father) was aboard at the time. While temporarily working in a net factory following the loss of his vessel, he was scouted by a Navy officer recruiting experienced local fishing captains to command a flotilla of tiny fishing vessels, which were to be secretly armed. The boats were intended to be working fishing vessels fitted with a small artillery piece with which to sink enemy submarines as they surfaced alongside. In this manner it was hoped they would protect the fishing fleets without the diversion of major resources from the regular fleet, in the same manner as <a href="Q-ship">Q-ship</a>s deployed in the commercial sea lanes.

Agreeing to this proposal, Crisp became first a Seaman and by the summer of 1916 a Skipper in the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Reserve">Royal Naval Reserve</a>, arranging for his son to join the crew of his boat, the HM Armed Smack "I'll Try", armed with a 3–pounder gun. On 1 February 1917 in the North Sea, "I'll Try" had its first confrontation with the enemy when two submarines surfaced close to the smack and her companion the larger "Boy Alfred". Despite near misses from enemy torpedoes, both smacks scored hits on their larger opponents and reported them as probable sinkings, although post–war German records show that no submarines were lost on that date. Both skippers were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and a present of £200 for this action, and Crisp was offered a promotion and transfer to an ocean–going Q-ship. He was forced to turn down this offer due to his wife's sudden and terminal illness. She died in June 1917.

In July, "I'll Try" was renamed "Nelson" and "Boy Alfred" became "Ethel & Millie", in an effort to maintain their cover. The boats continued to operate together and Crisp's crew was augmented with two regular seamen and a <a href="Royal%20Marine">Royal Marine</a> rifleman, providing "Nelson" with a crew of ten, including Crisp and his son. The smacks set out as usual on 15 August and pulled in a catch during the morning before making a sweep near the <a href="Jim%20Howe%20Bank">Jim Howe Bank</a> in search of cruising enemies. At 2.30 pm, Crisp spotted a German U-boat on the surface away. The U-boat also sighted the smack and both vessels began firing at once, the U-boat's weapon scoring several hits before "Nelson"s could be brought to bear. By this stage in the war, German submarine captains were aware of the decoy ship tactics and no longer stopped British merchant shipping, preferring to sink them from a distance with gunfire.

With such a heavy disparity in armament between the smack's 3-pounder and the submarine's 88 mm deck gun the engagement was short lived, the submarine firing eight shots before the "Nelson" could get within range of her opponent. The fourth shot fired by the U-boat holed the smack, and the seventh tore off both of Crisp's legs from underneath him. Calling for the confidential papers to be thrown overboard, Crisp dictated a message to be sent by the boat's four <a href="carrier%20pigeons">carrier pigeons</a>: like many small ships of the era, "Nelson" did not possess a radio set.

"Nelson being attacked by submarine. Skipper killed. Jim Howe Bank. Send assistance at once."

The sinking smack was abandoned by the nine unwounded crew, who attempted to remove their captain, who ordered that he should be thrown overboard rather than slow them down. The crew refused to do so, but found they were unable to move him and left him where he lay. He died in his son's arms a few minutes later. It is said that he was smiling as he died and remained so as the ship sank underneath him."Ethel & Millie" had just arrived on the scene as "Nelson" sank, and her captain Skipper Charles Manning called for "Nelson"s lifeboat to come alongside. Realising that this would greatly overcrowd the second boat, the survivors refused and Manning sailed onwards towards the submarine, coming under lethal fire as he did so. His vessel was soon badly damaged and began to sink.

The crew of "Ethel & Millie" then abandoned their battered boat and were hauled aboard the German submarine, where the "Nelson" survivors last saw them standing in line being addressed by a German officer. The seven British sailors of "Ethel & Millie" were never seen again, and much controversy exists surrounding their disappearance. Prevailing opinion at the time was that they were murdered and dumped overboard by the German crew or abandoned at sea without supplies, but these scenarios cannot be substantiated. Another theory is that they were taken prisoner aboard the boat and killed when the submarine was itself sunk. The son of Arthur Soanes, a sailor who disappeared in this incident, later claimed to have contacted his father through his powers as a <a href="spiritual%20medium">spiritual medium</a>, reporting that he had died on board the German vessel. UC 63 has been named as the submarine that sank both vessels.

The survivors of "Nelson" drifted for nearly two days until they arrived at the <a href="Jim%20Howe%20Buoy">Jim Howe Buoy</a>, where they were rescued by the fishery protection vessel "Dryad". A pigeon named "Red Cock" had reached the authorities in Lowestoft with news of the fate of the boats and caused the "Dryad" to be despatched to search for survivors.

A court of enquiry praised the surviving crew and their dead captain and authorised the award of the Victoria Cross posthumously to Thomas Crisp and <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Medal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Service Medals</a> to his son and another member of the crew. On 29 October 1917, David Lloyd George made an emotional speech in the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> citing Crisp's sacrifice as representative of the Royal Navy's commitment "from the icy waters of the Arctic Ocean to the stormy floods of Magellan", which promoted Crisp into an overnight celebrity whose story ran in all the major London papers for nearly a week, containing as it did a story of personal sacrifice, filial devotion and <a href="Anti-German%20sentiment%23World%20War%20I">perceived German barbarity</a>. The medal presentation was made to Tom Crisp Jr. at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> on 19 December 1917.

Thomas Crisp, VC, DSC, is memorialized on his wife's gravestone in <a href="Lowestoft%20Cemetery">Lowestoft Cemetery</a>.

After the war, a small display to the memory of Thomas Crisp Sr. was set up in Lowestoft free library and another in <a href="Lowestoft%20Maritime%20Museum">Lowestoft Maritime Museum</a>. The former contained a specially commissioned painting and parts of the sunken "Nelson", which were dredged up years later. This display was destroyed during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> when the building was gutted in <a href="the%20Blitz">the Blitz</a>. A new display featuring a replica of the Victoria Cross awarded to Tom Crisp currently stands in Lowestoft town hall. The original is held secure by the local council after the family of Skipper Crisp felt his interests would not be served if the medal were held privately. It can be viewed on request of Waveney District Council's Chief Executive. Thomas Crisp's name is inscribed on the <a href="Chatham%20Naval%20Memorial">Chatham Naval Memorial</a> for those lost at sea during the First World War, as well as two church memorials in Lowestoft to the town's war dead, St. John's and St. Margaret's. The latter church also contains a "VC Bell" dedicated to Thomas Crisp's memory. Tom Crisp Way, a street in his native Lowestoft, is named in his honour.

In a footnote to the action, the pigeon "Red Cock", which brought news of the engagement to the authorities, was stuffed upon his death and was mounted in the Thomas Crisp display at <a href="Lowestoft%23Town%20Hall">Lowestoft Town Hall</a> for many years before being reportedly relocated to a museum in <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a>.

I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings

I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is a 1969 <a href="autobiography">autobiography</a> describing the early years of American writer and poet <a href="Maya%20Angelou">Maya Angelou</a>. The first in a seven-volume series, it is a <a href="Bildungsroman">coming-of-age story</a> that illustrates how strength of character and a love of literature can help overcome <a href="racism">racism</a> and <a href="Psychological%20trauma">trauma</a>. The book begins when three-year-old Maya and her older brother are sent to <a href="Stamps%2C%20Arkansas">Stamps, Arkansas</a>, to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a mother at the age of 16. In the course of "Caged Bird", Maya transforms from a victim of racism with an <a href="inferiority%20complex">inferiority complex</a> into a self-possessed, dignified young woman capable of responding to prejudice.

Angelou was challenged by her friend, author <a href="James%20Baldwin">James Baldwin</a>, and her editor, <a href="Robert%20Loomis">Robert Loomis</a>, to write an autobiography that was also a piece of literature. Reviewers often categorize "Caged Bird" as <a href="Biography%20in%20literature">autobiographical fiction</a> because Angelou uses thematic development and other techniques common to fiction, but the prevailing critical view characterizes it as an autobiography, a genre she attempts to critique, change, and expand. The book covers topics common to autobiographies written by Black American women in the years following the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>: a celebration of Black motherhood; a critique of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition.

Angelou uses her autobiography to explore subjects such as <a href="Cultural%20identity">identity</a>, <a href="rape">rape</a>, racism, and <a href="literacy">literacy</a>. She also writes in new ways about women's lives in a male-dominated society. Maya, the younger version of Angelou and the book's central character, has been called "a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America". Angelou's description of being raped as an eight-year-old child overwhelms the book, although it is presented briefly in the text. Another metaphor, that of a bird struggling to escape its cage, is a central image throughout the work, which consists of "a sequence of lessons about resisting racist oppression". Angelou's treatment of racism provides a thematic unity to the book. Literacy and the power of words help young Maya cope with her bewildering world; books become her refuge as she works through her trauma.

"Caged Bird" was nominated for a <a href="National%20Book%20Award">National Book Award</a> in 1970 and remained on <a href="New%20York%20Times%20bestseller%20list">"The New York Times" paperback bestseller list</a> for two years. It has been used in educational settings from high schools to universities, and the book has been celebrated for creating new literary avenues for the American memoir. However, the book's graphic depiction of childhood rape, racism, and sexuality has caused it to be challenged or banned in some schools and libraries.

Before writing "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" at the age of forty, Angelou had a long and varied career, holding jobs such as composer, singer, actor, civil rights worker, journalist, and educator. In the late 1950s, she joined the <a href="Harlem%20Writers%20Guild">Harlem Writers Guild</a>, where she met a number of important African-American authors, including her friend and mentor <a href="James%20Baldwin%20%28writer%29">James Baldwin</a>. After hearing civil rights leader <a href="Dr.%20Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> speak for the first time in 1960, she was inspired to join the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>. She organized several benefits for him, and he named her Northern Coordinator of the <a href="Southern%20Christian%20Leadership%20Conference">Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a>. She worked for several years in <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, West Africa, as a journalist, actress, and educator. She was invited back to the US by <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a> to work for him shortly before his assassination in 1965. In 1968, King asked her to organize a march, but he too was <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.%20assassination">assassinated</a> on April 4, which also happened to be her birthday. For many years, Angelou responded to King's murder by not celebrating her birthday, instead choosing to meet with, call, or send flowers to his widow, <a href="Coretta%20Scott%20King">Coretta Scott King</a>.

Angelou was deeply depressed in the months following King's assassination, so to help lift her spirits, Baldwin brought her to a dinner party at the home of cartoonist <a href="Jules%20Feiffer">Jules Feiffer</a> and his wife Judy in late 1968. The guests began telling stories of their childhoods and Angelou's stories impressed Judy Feiffer. The next day she called <a href="Robert%20Loomis">Robert Loomis</a> at <a href="Random%20House">Random House</a>, who became Angelou's editor throughout her long writing career until he retired in 2011, and "told him that he ought to get this woman to write a book". At first, Angelou refused, since she thought of herself as a poet and playwright. According to Angelou, Baldwin had a "covert hand" in getting her to write the book, and advised Loomis to use "a little reverse psychology", and reported that Loomis tricked her into it by daring her: "It's just as well", he said, "because to write an autobiography as literature is just about impossible". Angelou was unable to resist a challenge, and she began writing "Caged Bird." After "closeting herself" in London, it took her two years to write it. She shared the manuscript with her friend, writer <a href="Jessica%20Mitford">Jessica Mitford</a>, before submitting it for publication.

Angelou subsequently wrote six additional autobiographies, covering a variety of her young adult experiences. They are distinct in style and narration, but unified in their themes and stretch from Arkansas to Africa, and back to the US, from the beginnings of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> to King's assassination. Like "Caged Bird", the events in these books are episodic and crafted as a series of short stories, yet do not follow a strict chronology. Later books in the series include "<a href="Gather%20Together%20in%20My%20Name">Gather Together in My Name</a>" (1974), "<a href="Singin%27%20and%20Swingin%27%20and%20Gettin%27%20Merry%20Like%20Christmas">Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas</a>" (1976), "<a href="The%20Heart%20of%20a%20Woman">The Heart of a Woman</a>" (1981), "<a href="All%20God%27s%20Children%20Need%20Traveling%20Shoes">All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes</a>" (1986), "<a href="A%20Song%20Flung%20Up%20to%20Heaven">A Song Flung Up to Heaven</a>" (2002), and "<a href="Mom%20%26amp%3B%20Me%20%26amp%3B%20Mom">Mom & Me & Mom</a>" (2013, at the age of 85). Critics have often judged Angelou's later autobiographies "in light of the first", and "Caged Bird" generally receives the highest praise.

Beginning with "Caged Bird", Angelou used the same "writing ritual" for many years. She would get up at five in the morning and check into a hotel room, where the staff were instructed to remove any pictures from the walls. She wrote on yellow legal pads while lying on the bed, with a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play <a href="solitaire">solitaire</a>, "<a href="Roget%27s%20Thesaurus">Roget's Thesaurus</a>", and the Bible, and left by the early afternoon. She averaged 10–12 pages of material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening. Lupton stated that this ritual indicated "a firmness of purpose and an inflexible use of time". Angelou went through this process to give herself time to turn the events of her life into art, and to "enchant" herself; as she said in a 1989 interview with the <a href="British%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">BBC</a>, to "relive the agony, the anguish, the "<a href="Sturm%20und%20Drang">Sturm und Drang</a>"". She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even during traumatic experiences like her rape in "Caged Bird", to "tell the human truth" about her life. Critic Opal Moore says about "Caged Bird": "...Though easily read, [it] is no 'easy read'". Angelou stated that she played cards to reach that place of enchantment, to access her memories more effectively. She has stated, "It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it—ha! It's so delicious!" She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in "telling the truth".

When selecting a title, Angelou turned to <a href="Paul%20Laurence%20Dunbar">Paul Laurence Dunbar</a>, an Afro-American poet whose works she had admired for years. <a href="Jazz">Jazz</a> vocalist and civil rights activist <a href="Abbey%20Lincoln">Abbey Lincoln</a> suggested the title. According to Lyman B. Hagen, the title pulls Angelou's readers into the book while reminding them that it is possible to both lose control of one's life and to have one's freedom taken from them. Angelou has credited Dunbar, along with <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, with forming her "writing ambition". The title of the book comes from the third stanza of Dunbar's poem "Sympathy":

I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,When he beats his bars and would be free;It is not a carol of joy or glee,But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings – I know why the caged bird sings. 

"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" follows Marguerite's (called "My" or "Maya" by her brother) life from the age of three to seventeen and the struggles she faces – particularly with <a href="racism">racism</a> – in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern United States</a>. Abandoned by their parents, Maya and her older brother Bailey are sent to live with their paternal grandmother (Momma) and crippled uncle (Uncle Willie) in <a href="Stamps%2C%20Arkansas">Stamps, Arkansas</a>. Maya and Bailey are haunted by their parents' abandonment throughout the book – they travel alone and are labeled like baggage.
Many of the problems Maya encounters in her childhood stem from the overt racism of her white neighbors. Although Mamma is relatively wealthy because she owns the general store at the heart of Stamps' Black community, the white children of their town hassle Maya's family relentlessly. One of these "powhitetrash" girls, for example, reveals her pubic hair to Momma in a humiliating incident. Early in the book, Momma hides Uncle Willie in a vegetable bin to protect him from <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> raiders. Maya has to endure the insult of her name being changed to Mary by a racist employer. A white speaker at her eighth grade graduation ceremony disparages the Black audience by suggesting that they have limited job opportunities. A white dentist refuses to treat Maya's rotting tooth, even when Momma reminds him that she had loaned him money during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Depression</a>. The Black community of Stamps enjoys a moment of racial victory when they listen to the radio broadcast of <a href="Joe%20Louis">Joe Louis</a>'s championship fight, but generally, they feel the heavy weight of racist oppression.

A turning point in the book occurs when Maya and Bailey's father unexpectedly appears in Stamps. He takes the two children with him when he departs, but leaves them with their mother in <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>. Eight-year-old Maya is sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, Mr. Freeman. He is found guilty during the trial, but escapes jail time and is murdered, presumably by Maya's uncles. Maya feels guilty and withdraws from everyone but her brother. Even after returning to Stamps, Maya remains reclusive and nearly mute until she meets Mrs. Bertha Flowers, "the aristocrat of Black Stamps", who encourages her through books and communication to regain her voice and soul. This coaxes Maya out of her shell.

Later, Momma decides to send her grandchildren to their mother in <a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California">San Francisco, California</a>, to protect them from the dangers of racism in Stamps. Maya attends <a href="George%20Washington%20High%20School%20%28San%20Francisco%29">George Washington High School</a> and studies dance and drama on a scholarship at the <a href="California%20Labor%20School">California Labor School</a>. Before graduating, she becomes the first Black female <a href="streetcar">streetcar</a> conductor in San Francisco. While still in high school, Maya visits her father in southern California one summer and has some experiences pivotal to her development. She drives a car for the first time when she must transport her intoxicated father home from an excursion to Mexico. She experiences homelessness for a short time after a fight with her father's girlfriend.

During Maya's final year of high school, she worries that she might be a <a href="lesbian">lesbian</a> (which she confuses due to her sexual inexperience with the belief that lesbians are also <a href="hermaphrodites">hermaphrodites</a>). She ultimately initiates sexual intercourse with a teenage boy. She becomes pregnant, which on the advice of her brother, she hides from her family until her eighth month of pregnancy in order to graduate from high school. Maya gives birth at the end of the book.

Angelou's prose works, while presenting a unique interpretation of the <a href="autobiography">autobiographical form</a>, can be placed in the long tradition of African-American autobiography. Her use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and thematic development, however, often lead reviewers to categorize her books, including "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings", as <a href="autobiographical%20fiction">autobiographical fiction</a>. Other critics, like Lupton, insist that Angelou's books should be categorized as autobiographies because they conform to the genre's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme. In a 1983 interview with African-American literature critic <a href="Claudia%20Tate">Claudia Tate</a>, Angelou calls her books autobiographies.

At first, Angelou intended to return to poetry and play-writing after completing "Caged Bird" and write no more autobiographies, but she chose the genre as her primary mode of expression because of its challenge and so that she could "change it, to make it bigger, richer, finer, and more inclusive in the twentieth century". In a 1989 interview, she stated, "I think I am the only serious writer who has chosen the autobiographical form to carry my work, my expression". As she told journalist <a href="George%20Plimpton">George Plimpton</a> during a 1990 interview, "Autobiography is awfully seductive; it’s wonderful". She also told Plimpton that like the tradition begun by <a href="Frederick%20Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a> in <a href="slave%20narratives">slave narratives</a>, she used the literary technique of "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'". As critic Susan Gilbert states, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's. Scholar <a href="Selwyn%20R.%20Cudjoe">Selwyn R. Cudjoe</a> agrees, and sees Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people.

Scholar Joanne M. Braxton sees "Caged Bird" as "the fully developed black female autobiographical form that began to emerge in the 1940s and 1950s". The book presents themes that are common in autobiography by Black American women: a celebration of Black motherhood; a criticism of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition. Angelou introduces a unique point of view in American autobiography by revealing her life story through a narrator who is a Black female from the South, at some points a child, and other points a mother. Writer <a href="Hilton%20Als">Hilton Als</a> calls Angelou one of the "pioneers of self-exposure", willing to focus honestly on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices. For example, Angelou was worried about her readers' reactions to her disclosure in her second autobiography, "<a href="Gather%20Together%20in%20My%20Name">Gather Together in My Name</a>", that she was a prostitute. She went through with it, anyway, after her husband Paul Du Feu advised her to be honest about it.

Angelou has recognized that there are fictional aspects to her books, and that she tends to "diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth". Angelou discussed her writing process with Plimpton, and when asked if she changed the truth to improve her story, she admitted that she had. She stated, "Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite of three or four people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about." Although Angelou has never admitted to changing the facts in her stories, she has used these facts to make an impact with the reader. As Hagen states, "One can assume that 'the essence of the data' is present in Angelou's work". Hagen also states that Angelou "fictionalizes, to enhance interest". For example, Angelou uses the <a href="First-person%20narrative">first-person narrative voice</a> customary with autobiographies, told from the perspective of a child that is "artfully recreated by an adult narrator".

Angelou uses two distinct voices, the adult writer and the child who is the focus of the book, whom Angelou calls "the Maya character". Angelou reports that maintaining the distinction between herself and the Maya character is "damned difficult", but "very necessary". Scholar Liliane Arensberg suggests that Angelou "retaliates for the tongue-tied child's helpless pain" by using her adult self's <a href="irony">irony</a> and wit. As such, "Caged Bird" has been called a "<a href="Bildungsroman">Bildungsroman</a>" or coming-of-age story; critic Mary Jane Lupton compares it to other "Bildungsromans" like <a href="George%20Eliot">George Eliot</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Mill%20on%20the%20Floss">The Mill on the Floss</a>". According to Lupton, the two books share the following similarities: a focus on young strong-willed heroines who have solid relationships with their brothers, an examination of the role of literature in life, and an emphasis on the importance of family and community life.

When Angelou wrote "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" at the end of the 1960s, one of the necessary and accepted features of literature, according to critic Pierre A. Walker, was thematic unity. One of Angelou's goals was to create a book that satisfied this criterion, in order to achieve her political purposes, which were to demonstrate how to resist racism in America. The structure of the text, which resembles a series of short stories, is not chronological but rather thematic. Walker, in his 1993 article about "Caged Bird", "Racial Protest, Identity, Words, and Form", focuses on the book's structure, and describes how it supports her presentation of racism. According to Walker, critics had neglected analyzing its structure, choosing to focus instead on its themes, which he feels neglects the political nature of the book. He states, "One serves Angelou and "Caged Bird" better by emphasizing how form and political content work together". Angelou structures her book so that it presents a series of lessons about how to resist racism and oppression. The progression Maya goes through thematically unifies the book, something that "stands in contrast to the otherwise episodic quality of the narrative". The way in which Angelou constructs, arranges, and organizes her vignettes often undermined the chronology of her childhood by "juxtaposing the events of one chapter with the events of preceding and following ones so that they too comment on each other".

For example, the incident with the "powhitetrash" girls takes place in chapter 5, when Maya was ten years old, well before Angelou's recounting of her rape in chapter 12, which occurred when Maya was 8. Walker explains that Angelou's purpose in placing the vignettes in this way is that it followed her thematic structure. Angelou's editor, <a href="Robert%20Loomis">Robert Loomis</a>, agrees, stating that Angelou could rewrite any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader. Hagen sees Angelou's structure somewhat differently, focusing on Maya's journey "to establish a worthwhile self-concept", and states that she structures the book into three parts: arrival, sojourn, and departure, which occur both geographically and psychologically. However, Hagen notes that instead of beginning "Caged Bird" chronologically, with Maya and Bailey's arrival in Stamps, Angelou begins the book much later chronologically by recounting an embarrassing experience at church, an incident that demonstrates Maya's diminished sense of self, insecurity, and lack of status. Hagen explains that Angelou's purpose is to demonstrate Maya's journey from insecurity to her feelings of worth gained by becoming a mother at the end of the book.

In the course of "Caged Bird", Maya, who has been described as "a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America", goes from being a victim of racism with an inferiority complex to a self-aware individual who responds to racism with dignity and a strong sense of her own identity. <a href="Feminist%20literary%20criticism">Feminist scholar</a> Maria Lauret states that the "formation of female cultural identity" is woven into the book's narrative, setting Maya up as "a role model for Black women". Scholar Liliane Arensberg calls this presentation Angelou's "identity theme" and a major motif in Angelou's narrative. Maya's unsettled life in "Caged Bird" suggests her sense of self "as perpetually in the process of becoming, of dying and being reborn, in all its ramifications". African-American literature scholar Dolly McPherson agrees, stating that Angelou creatively uses Christian mythology and theology to present the Biblical themes of death, regeneration, and rebirth.

As Lauret indicates, Angelou and other female writers in the late 1960s and early 1970s used autobiography to reimagine ways of writing about women's lives and identities in a male-dominated society. Up until this time, Black women were not depicted realistically in African-American fiction and autobiography, meaning that Angelou was one of the first Black autobiographers to present, as Cudjoe put it, "a powerful and authentic signification of [African-American] womanhood in her quest for understanding and love rather than for bitterness and despair". Lauret sees a connection between Angelou's autobiographies, which Lauret calls "fictions of subjectivity" and "feminist first-person narratives", and fictional first-person narratives (such as "<a href="The%20Women%27s%20Room">The Women's Room</a>" by <a href="Marilyn%20French">Marilyn French</a> and "<a href="The%20Golden%20Notebook">The Golden Notebook</a>" by <a href="Doris%20Lessing">Doris Lessing</a>) written during the same period. As French and Lessing do in their novels, Angelou employs the narrator as <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a> and depends upon "the illusion of presence in their mode of signification".

As a displaced girl, Maya's pain is worsened by an awareness of her displacement. She is "the forgotten child", and must come to terms with "the unimaginable reality" of being unloved and unwanted; she lives in a hostile world that defines beauty in terms of whiteness and that rejects her simply because she is a Black girl. Maya internalizes the rejection she has experienced – her belief in her own ugliness was "absolute". McPherson believes that the concept of family, or what she calls "kinship concerns", in Angelou's books must be understood in the light of the children's displacement at the beginning of "Caged Bird". Being sent away from their parents was a psychological rejection, and resulted in a quest for love, acceptance, and self-worth for both Maya and Bailey.

Angelou uses her many roles, incarnations, and identities throughout her books to illustrate how oppression and personal history are interrelated. For example, in "Caged Bird", Angelou demonstrates the "racist habit" of renaming African Americans, as shown when her white employer insists on calling her "Mary". Angelou describes the employer's renaming as the "hellish horror of being 'called out of [one's] name'". Scholar Debra Walker King calls it a racist insult and an assault against Maya's race and self-image. The renaming emphasizes Maya's feelings of inadequacy and denigrates her identity, individuality, and uniqueness. Maya understands that she is being insulted and rebels by breaking Mrs. Cullinan's favorite dish, but feels vindicated when, as she leaves her employer's home, Mrs. Cullinan finally gets her name right. Another incident in the book that solidifies Maya's identity is her trip to Mexico with her father, when she has to drive a car for the first time. Contrasted with her experience in Stamps, Maya is finally "in control of her fate". This experience is central to Maya's growth, as is the incident that immediately follows it, her short period of homelessness after arguing with her father's girlfriend. These two incidents give Maya a knowledge of self-determination and confirm her self-worth.

Scholar Mary Burgher believes that female Black autobiographers like Angelou have debunked the stereotypes of African-American mothers as "breeder[s] and matriarch[s]", and have presented them as having "a creative and personally fulfilling role". Lupton believes that Angelou's plot construction and character development were influenced by the same mother/child motif as is found in the work of <a href="Harlem%20Renaissance">Harlem Renaissance</a> poet <a href="Jessie%20Fauset">Jessie Fauset</a>. For the first five years of her life, Maya thinks of herself as an orphan and finds comfort in the thought that her mother is dead. Maya's feelings for and relationship with her own mother, whom she blames for her abandonment, express themselves in ambivalence and "repressed violent aggression". For example, Maya and her brother destroy the first Christmas gifts sent by their mother. These strong feelings are not resolved until the end of the book, when Maya becomes a mother herself, and her mother finally becomes the nurturing presence for which Maya has longed. The two main maternal influences on Maya's life change as well; Vivian becomes a more active participant, while Momma becomes less effective as Maya, by becoming a mother herself, moves from childhood to adulthood.

Stamps, Arkansas, as depicted in "Caged Bird", has very little "social ambiguity": it is a racist world divided between Black and white, male and female. Als characterizes the division as "good and evil", and notes how Angelou's witness of the evil in her society, which was directed at Black women, shaped Angelou's young life and informed her views into adulthood. Angelou uses the metaphor of a bird struggling to escape its cage, described in <a href="Paul%20Laurence%20Dunbar">Paul Laurence Dunbar's</a> poem, as a prominent symbol throughout her series of autobiographies. Like elements within a prison narrative, the caged bird represents Angelou's confinement resulting from racism and oppression. The caged bird metaphor also invokes the "supposed contradiction of the bird singing in the midst of its struggle". Scholar Ernece B. Kelley calls "Caged Bird" a "gentle indictment of white American womanhood"; Hagen expands it further, stating that the book is "a dismaying story of white dominance".

"Caged Bird" has been called "perhaps the most aesthetically satisfying autobiography written in the years immediately following the Civil Rights era". Critic Pierre A. Walker expresses a similar sentiment, and places it in the African-American literature tradition of political protest. Angelou demonstrates, through her involvement with the Black community of Stamps, as well as her presentation of vivid and realistic racist characters and "the vulgarity of white Southern attitudes toward African Americans", her developing understanding of the rules for surviving in a racist society. Angelou's autobiographies, beginning with "Caged Bird", contain a sequence of lessons about resisting oppression. The sequence she describes leads Angelou, as the protagonist, from "helpless rage and indignation to forms of subtle resistance, and finally to outright and active protest".

Walker insists that Angelou's treatment of racism is what gives her autobiographies their thematic unity and underscores one of their central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it. For example, in Angelou's depiction of the "powhitetrash" incident, Maya reacts with rage, indignation, humiliation, and helplessness, but Momma teaches her how they can maintain their personal dignity and pride while dealing with racism, and that it is an effective basis for actively protesting and combating racism. Walker calls Momma's way a "strategy of subtle resistance" and McPherson calls it "the dignified course of silent endurance".

Angelou portrays Momma as a realist whose patience, courage, and silence ensured the survival and success of those who came after her. For example, Maya responds assertively when subjected to demeaning treatment by Mrs. Cullinan, her white employer, and, later on in the book, breaks the race barrier to become the first black streetcar operator in San Francisco. In addition, Angelou's description of the strong and cohesive black community of Stamps demonstrates how African Americans subvert repressive institutions to withstand racism. Arensberg insists that Angelou demonstrates how she, as a Black child, evolves out of her "racial hatred", common in the works of many contemporary Black novelists and autobiographers. At first Maya wishes that she could become white, since growing up Black in white America is dangerous; later she sheds her self-loathing and embraces a strong racial identity.

Angelou's description of being raped as an eight-year-old child overwhelms the autobiography, although it is presented briefly in the text. Scholar Mary Vermillion compares Angelou's treatment of rape to that of <a href="Harriet%20Jacobs">Harriet Jacobs</a> in her autobiography "<a href="Incidents%20in%20the%20Life%20of%20a%20Slave%20Girl">Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</a>". Jacobs and Angelou both use rape as a metaphor for the suffering of African Americans; Jacobs uses the metaphor to critique slaveholding culture, while Angelou uses it to first internalize, then challenge, twentieth-century racist conceptions of the Black female body (namely, that the Black female is physically unattractive). Rape, according to Vermillion, "represents the black girl's difficulties in controlling, understanding, and respecting both her body and her words".

Arensberg notes that Maya's rape is connected to the theme of death in "Caged Bird", as Mr. Freeman threatens to kill Maya's brother Bailey if she tells anyone about the rape. After Maya lies during Freeman's trial, stating that the rape was the first time he touched her inappropriately, Freeman is murdered (presumably by one of Maya's uncles) and Maya sees her words as a bringer of death. As a result, she resolves never to speak to anyone other than Bailey. Angelou connects the violation of her body and the devaluation of her words through the depiction of her self-imposed, five-year-long silence. As Angelou later stated, "I thought if I spoke, my mouth would just issue out something that would kill people, randomly, so it was better not to talk".

African-American literature scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe calls Angelou's depiction of the rape "a burden" of "Caged Bird": a demonstration of "the manner in which the Black female is violated in her tender years and ... the 'unnecessary insult' of Southern girlhood in her movement to adolescence". Vermillion goes further, maintaining that a Black woman who writes about her rape risks reinforcing negative stereotypes about her race and gender. When asked decades later how she was able to survive such trauma, Angelou explained it by stating, "I can't remember a time when I wasn't loved by somebody." When asked by the same interviewer why she wrote about the experience, she indicated that she wanted to demonstrate the complexities of rape. She also wanted to prevent it from happening to someone else, so that anyone who had been raped might gain understanding and not blame herself for it.

As Lupton points out, all of Angelou's autobiographies, especially "Caged Bird" and its immediate sequel "<a href="Gather%20Together%20in%20My%20Name">Gather Together in My Name</a>", are "very much concerned with what [Angelou] knew and how she learned it". Lupton compares Angelou's informal education with the education of other Black writers of the twentieth century, who did not earn official degrees and depended upon the "direct instruction of African American cultural forms". Angelou's quest for learning and literacy parallels "the central myth of black culture in America": that freedom and literacy are connected. Angelou is influenced by writers introduced to her by Mrs. Flowers during her self-imposed muteness, including <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> and <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>. Angelou states, early in "Caged Bird", that she, as the Maya character, "met and fell in love with William Shakespeare". Critic Mary Vermillion sees a connection between Maya's rape and Shakespeare's "<a href="The%20Rape%20of%20Lucrece">The Rape of Lucrece</a>", which Maya memorizes and recites when she regains her speech. Vermillion maintains that Maya finds comfort in the poem's identification with suffering. Maya finds novels and their characters complete and meaningful, so she uses them to make sense of her bewildering world. She is so involved in her fantasy world of books that she even uses them as a way to cope with her rape, writing in "Caged Bird", "...I was sure that any minute my mother or Bailey or the <a href="The%20Green%20Hornet">Green Hornet</a> would bust in the door and save me".

According to Walker, the power of words is another theme that appears repeatedly in "Caged Bird". For example, Maya chooses to not speak after her rape because she is afraid of the destructive power of words. Mrs. Flowers, by introducing her to classic literature and poetry, teaches her about the positive power of language and empowers Maya to speak again. The importance of both the spoken and written word also appears repeatedly in "Caged Bird" and in all of Angelou's autobiographies. Referring to the importance of literacy and methods of effective writing, Angelou once advised <a href="Oprah%20Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> in a 1993 interview to "do as West Africans do ... listen to the deep talk", or the "utterances existing beneath the obvious". McPherson says, "If there is one stable element in Angelou's youth it is [a] dependence upon books". The public library is a "quiet refuge" to which Maya retreats when she experiences crisis. Hagen describes Angelou as a "natural story-teller", which "reflect[s] a good listener with a rich oral heritage". Hagen also insists that Angelou's years of muteness provided her with this skill.

Angelou was also powerfully affected by <a href="slave%20narratives">slave narratives</a>, <a href="spirituals">spirituals</a>, poetry, and other autobiographies. Angelou read through the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> twice as a young child, and memorized many passages from it. African-American spirituality, as represented by Angelou's grandmother, has influenced all of Angelou's writings, in the activities of the church community she first experiences in Stamps, in the sermonizing, and in scripture. Hagen goes on to say that in addition to being influenced by rich literary form, Angelou has also been influenced by oral traditions. In "Caged Bird", Mrs. Flowers encourages her to listen carefully to "Mother Wit", which Hagen defines as the collective wisdom of the African-American community as expressed in <a href="folklore">folklore</a> and humor.

Angelou's humor in "Caged Bird" and in all her autobiographies is drawn from Black folklore and is used to demonstrate that in spite of severe racism and oppression, Black people thrive and are, as Hagen states, "a community of song and laughter and courage". Hagen states that Angelou is able to make an indictment of institutionalized racism as she laughs at her flaws and the flaws of her community and "balances stories of black endurance of oppression against white myths and misperceptions". Hagen also characterize "Caged Bird" as a "blues genre autobiography" because it uses elements of <a href="blues%20music">blues music</a>. These elements include the act of testimony when speaking of one's life and struggles, ironic understatement, and the use of natural metaphors, rhythms, and intonations. Hagen also sees elements of African American sermonizing in "Caged Bird". Angelou's use of African-American oral traditions creates a sense of community in her readers, and identifies those who belong to it.

"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" is the most highly acclaimed of Angelou's autobiographies. The other volumes in her series of seven autobiographies are judged and compared to "Caged Bird." It became a bestseller immediately after it was published. Angelou's friend and mentor, <a href="James%20Baldwin%20%28writer%29">James Baldwin</a>, maintained that her book "liberates the reader into life" and called it "a Biblical study of life in the midst of death". According to Angelou's biographers, "Readers, especially women, and in particular Black women, took the book to heart".
By the end of 1969, critics had placed Angelou in the tradition of other Black autobiographers. Poet James Bertolino asserts that "Caged Bird" "is one of the essential books produced by our culture". He insists that "[w]e should all read it, especially our children". It was nominated for a <a href="National%20Book%20Award">National Book Award</a> in 1970, has never been out of print, and has been published in many languages. It has been a Book of the Month Club selection and an Ebony Book Club selection. In 2011, "Time Magazine" placed the book in its list of 100 best and most influential books written in English since 1923.

Critic Robert A. Gross called "Caged Bird" "a "tour de force" of language". Edmund Fuller insisted that Angelou's intellectual range and artistry were apparent in how she told her story. "Caged Bird" catapulted Angelou to international fame and critical acclaim, was a significant development in Black women's literature in that it "heralded the success of other now prominent writers". Other reviewers have praised Angelou's use of language in the book, including critic E. M. Guiney, who reported that "Caged Bird" was "one of the best autobiographies of its kind that I have read". Critic R. A. Gross praised Angelou for her use of rich and dazzling images.

By the mid-1980s, "Caged Bird" had gone through 20 hardback printings and 32 paperback printings. The week after Angelou recited her poem "<a href="On%20the%20Pulse%20of%20Morning">On the Pulse of Morning</a>" at President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>'s 1993 inauguration, sales of the paperback version of "Caged Bird" and her other works rose by 300–600 percent. "Caged Bird" had sold steadily since its publication, but it increased by 500 percent. The 16-page publication of "On the Pulse of Morning" became a best-seller, and the recording of the poem was awarded a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>. The Bantam Books edition of "Caged Bird" was a bestseller for 36 weeks, and they had to reprint 400,000 copies of her books to meet demand. <a href="Random%20House">Random House</a>, which published Angelou's hardcover books and the poem later that year, reported that they sold more of her books in January 1993 than they did in all of 1992, marking a 1,200 percent increase.

The book's reception has not been universally positive; for example, author <a href="Francine%20Prose">Francine Prose</a> considers its inclusion in the high school curriculum as partly responsible for the "dumbing down" of American society. Prose calls the book "manipulative melodrama", and considers Angelou's writing style an inferior example of poetic prose in memoir. She accuses Angelou of combining a dozen metaphors in one paragraph and for "obscuring ideas that could be expressed so much more simply and felicitously". Many parents throughout the U.S. have sought to ban the book from schools and libraries for being inappropriate for younger high school students, for promoting premarital sex, homosexuality, cohabitation, and pornography, and for not supporting traditional values. Parents have also objected to the book's use of profanity and to its graphic and violent depiction of rape and racism.

When "Caged Bird" was published in 1969, Angelou was hailed as a new kind of memoirist, one of the first African-American women who was able to publicly discuss her personal life. Up to that point, Black women writers were marginalized to the point that they were unable to present themselves as central characters. Writer Julian Mayfield, who called "Caged Bird" "a work of art that eludes description", has insisted that Angelou's autobiographies set a precedent for African-American autobiography as a whole. Als insisted that "Caged Bird" marked one of the first times that a Black autobiographer could, as Als put it, "write about blackness from the inside, without apology or defense". Through the writing of her autobiography, Angelou became recognized as a respected spokesperson for blacks and women. "Caged Bird" made her "without a doubt ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer". Although Als considers "Caged Bird" an important contribution to the increase of Black <a href="feminist">feminist</a> writings in the 1970s, he attributes its success less to its originality than to "its resonance in the prevailing <a href="Zeitgeist">Zeitgeist</a>" of its time, at the end of the American Civil Rights Movement. Angelou's writings, more interested in self-revelation than in politics or feminism, freed many other women writers to "open themselves up without shame to the eyes of the world".

Angelou's autobiographies, especially the first volume, have been used in narrative and multicultural approaches to <a href="teacher%20education">teacher education</a>. Jocelyn A. Glazier, a professor at <a href="George%20Washington%20University">George Washington University</a>, has used "Caged Bird" and "<a href="Gather%20Together%20in%20My%20Name">Gather Together in My Name</a>" when training teachers to appropriately explore racism in their classrooms. Angelou's use of understatement, self-mockery, humor, and irony causes readers of Angelou's autobiographies to wonder what she "left out" and to be unsure how to respond to the events Angelou describes. These techniques force white readers to explore their feelings about race and their privileged status in society. Glazier found that although critics have focused on where Angelou fits within the genre of African-American autobiography and her literary techniques, readers react to her storytelling with "surprise, particularly when [they] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography".

Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book "Stories of Resilience in Childhood", analyzed the events in "Caged Bird" to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used "Caged Bird" to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of <a href="child%20development">child development</a> topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.

"Caged Bird" has been criticized by many parents, causing it to be removed from school curricula and library shelves. The book was approved to be taught in public schools and was placed in public school libraries through the U.S. in the early-1980s, and was included in <a href="advanced%20placement">advanced placement</a> and <a href="Intellectual%20giftedness">gifted student</a> curricula, but attempts by parents to censor it began in 1983. It has been challenged in fifteen U.S. states. Educators have responded to these challenges by removing it from reading lists and libraries, by providing students with alternatives, and by requiring parental permission from students. Some have been critical of its sexually explicit scenes, use of language, and irreverent religious depictions.

"Caged Bird" appeared third on the <a href="American%20Library%20Association">American Library Association</a> (ALA) list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000, sixth on the ALA's 2000–2009 list, and one of the ten books most frequently banned from high school and junior high school libraries and classrooms.

A <a href="Television%20movie">made-for-TV movie</a> version of "<a href="I%20Know%20Why%20the%20Caged%20Bird%20Sings%20%281979%20Film%29">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</a>" was filmed in Mississippi and aired on April 28, 1979 on <a href="CBS">CBS</a>. Angelou and Leonora Thuna wrote the screenplay; the movie was directed by <a href="Fielder%20Cook">Fielder Cook</a>. Constance Good played young Maya. Also appearing were actors <a href="Esther%20Rolle">Esther Rolle</a>, <a href="Roger%20E.%20Mosley">Roger E.

Two scenes in the movie differed from events described in the book. Angelou added a scene between Maya and Uncle Willie after the <a href="Joe%20Louis">Joe Louis</a> fight; in it, he expresses his feelings of redemption and hope after Louis defeats a white opponent. Angelou also presents her eighth grade graduation differently in the film. In the book, Henry Reed delivers the valedictory speech and leads the Black audience in the <a href="Lift%20Every%20Voice%20and%20Sing">Negro national anthem</a>. In the movie, Maya conducts these activities.

Smyth Report

The Smyth Report is the common name of an administrative history written by American <a href="physicist">physicist</a> <a href="Henry%20DeWolf%20Smyth">Henry DeWolf Smyth</a> about the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>, the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> effort to develop <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>s during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The full title of the report is A General Account of the Development of Methods of Using Atomic Energy for Military Purposes. It was released to the public on August 12, 1945, just days after the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> on August 6 and 9.

Smyth was commissioned to write the report by <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves%2C%20Jr.">Leslie R. Groves, Jr.</a>, the director of the Manhattan Project. The Smyth Report was the first official account of the development of the atomic bombs and the basic physical processes behind them. It also served as an indication as to what information was <a href="Declassification">declassified</a>; anything in the Smyth Report could be discussed openly. For this reason, the Smyth Report focused heavily on information, such as basic <a href="nuclear%20physics">nuclear physics</a>, which was either already widely known in the scientific community or easily deducible by a competent scientist, and omitted details about <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>, <a href="metallurgy">metallurgy</a>, and <a href="weapon">ordnance</a>. This would ultimately give a false impression that the Manhattan Project was all about physics.

The Smyth Report sold almost 127,000 copies in its first eight printings, and was on "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" best-seller list from mid-October 1945 until late January 1946. It has been translated into over 40 languages.

<a href="Henry%20D.%20Smyth">Henry D. Smyth</a> was a professor of physics and chairman of the physics department of <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> from 1935 to 1949. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, he was involved in the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> from early 1941, initially as a member of the <a href="National%20Defense%20Research%20Committee">National Defense Research Committee</a>’s <a href="S-1%20Executive%20Committee">Committee on Uranium</a>, and later as an associate director of the <a href="Metallurgical%20Laboratory">Metallurgical Laboratory</a> in Chicago. In late 1943, the <a href="President%20of%20Princeton%20University">President of Princeton University</a>, <a href="Harold%20W.%20Dodds">Harold W. Dodds</a>, began insisting that Smyth work part-time at Princeton, where there was a shortage of physicists because so many of them were engaged in war work. Princeton had commitments to teach army and navy personnel, and he needed physicists like Smyth to meet those commitments. Smyth therefore became a consultant at Chicago, where he was in charge of designing a <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a> that used <a href="heavy%20water">heavy water</a> as a <a href="neutron%20moderator">neutron moderator</a>, and commuted from Princeton, working in Chicago on alternate weeks.

In early 1944, Smyth raised the possibility of producing an unclassified report for the general public on the achievements of the Manhattan Project. The director of the Metallurgical Laboratory, <a href="Arthur%20Compton">Arthur Compton</a>, supported the idea. He arranged a meeting with <a href="James%20B.%20Conant">James B. Conant</a>, the <a href="President%20of%20Harvard%20University">President of Harvard University</a> and one of the senior administrators of the Manhattan Project, who had similar thoughts. Conant took up the matter with the Manhattan Project's director, <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves%2C%20Jr.">Leslie R. Groves, Jr.</a>. In April, Smyth received a formal letter from Groves asking him to write such a report. Both the report and the choice of Smyth as its author were approved by the Manhattan Project’s governing body, the Military Policy Committee, in May 1944.

The Report was to serve two functions. First, it was to be the public and official U.S. government account of the development of the atomic bombs, outlining the development of the then-secret laboratories and production sites at <a href="Los%20Alamos%2C%20New%20Mexico">Los Alamos, New Mexico</a>, <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>, and <a href="Hanford%20site">Hanford, Washington</a>, and the basic physical processes responsible for the functioning of nuclear weapons, in particular <a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a> and the <a href="nuclear%20chain%20reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a>. Second, it served as a reference for other scientists as to what information was <a href="declassified">declassified</a>—anything said in the Smyth Report could be said freely in open literature. For this reason, the Smyth Report focused heavily on information already available in declassified literature, such as much of the basic <a href="nuclear%20physics">nuclear physics</a> used in weapons, which was either already widely known in the scientific community or could have been easily deduced by a competent scientist.

Smyth stated the purpose of the Smyth Report in the Preface:
This contrasted somewhat with what Groves wrote in the foreword:

Smyth possessed security clearances necessary to visit project sites, access documents and to discuss the work with the research personnel. Groves approved Smyth's request to hire another Princeton physicist, Lincoln G. Smith, as a research assistant. A letter to the Manhattan Project's senior managers, <a href="Kenneth%20Nichols">Kenneth Nichols</a>, <a href="Robert%20Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a>, <a href="Ernest%20Lawrence">Ernest Lawrence</a>, <a href="Harold%20Urey">Harold Urey</a>, and <a href="Franklin%20Matthias">Franklin Matthias</a>, explained:

Since Smyth still had his commitments at Princeton and Chicago, he could only work on the report part-time. He wrote the report in his office in Princeton's Palmer Laboratory. Bars were installed on the windows of Smyth's office and the one adjacent to it. The hallway door to his office was locked and blocked by a large safe so that the only access was through the adjacent office, where there was an armed guard. The guards worked in eight-hour shifts, and one was present around the clock. When Smyth sent papers to Groves in Washington, D.C., they went by military courier.

Smyth sent an outline and rough draft of the report to Groves for approval in August 1944, followed in February 1945 by drafts of the first twelve chapters, leaving only the final chapter to be completed. Groves and Conant reviewed the drafts, and made several criticisms. They felt that it was too technical for general readers, did not mention the names of enough participants, and dwelt too much on the activities at the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a>. Groves was particularly anxious that deserving people be mentioned, as he felt that this would lessen the danger of security breaches. After Smyth made a series of changes in response to this, Groves sent the manuscript to his scientific adviser, <a href="Richard%20Tolman">Richard Tolman</a>. Tolman was assisted by two physicists who were working in his office at the National Defense Research Committee as technical aides, Paul C. Fine from the <a href="University%20of%20Texas">University of Texas</a>, and <a href="William%20Shurcliff">William Shurcliff</a> from <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>. They had the dual task of editing and censoring the manuscript.

Smyth and Tolman accepted a set of criteria, agreeing that information could be released under the conditions: 

Writing to Oppenheimer in April 1945, Smyth noted that 
Tolman and his assistants finished making their changes in July 1945, and Groves had copies sent out by courier to selected personnel. Each submitted a written report, which was returned with the courier and the manuscript. These were busy people who sometimes only had a few days or even hours to look at the manuscript. Many, but not all, merely signed a statement saying that they were happy with it. Nichols, the commander of the Manhattan District, sent back a detailed review. He had concerns about the amount of credit being given to different people and organizations, and recommended that "full credit be given to H. D. Smyth for preparing it and that the statement be made that the Army has no responsibility for the report except for asking him to do it." Smyth was given credit, but no such statement was issued. To prepare the final draft for the printer, Groves brought typists with the required security clearances to Washington, D.C., from the Manhattan District's headquarters in Oak Ridge.

Because the Manhattan Project was an Allied endeavor, Groves had to obtain permission from the British and American governments to publish the Smyth Report. A meeting was held on August 2, 1945 in the office of the <a href="Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a>, <a href="Henry%20Stimson">Henry Stimson</a>. Accompanying Stimson were his two assistants, <a href="Harvey%20Bundy">Harvey Bundy</a> and <a href="George%20L.%20Harrison">George L. Harrison</a>, and his military aide, Colonel William H. Kyle. Groves, Conant, and Tolman represented the Manhattan Project. <a href="James%20Chadwick">James Chadwick</a>, the head of the <a href="British%20contribution%20to%20the%20Manhattan%20Project">British scientific mission to the Manhattan Project</a>, and <a href="Roger%20Makins%2C%201st%20Baron%20Sherfield">Roger Makins</a> from the British Embassy represented Britain. The meeting went on for two hours, as Groves and Conant sought to reassure Stimson that the report would not give vital secrets away to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>.

For his part, Chadwick, who had not yet read the manuscript, could not fathom why the Americans wanted to publish such a document. When he did read it, he became quite alarmed. His concerns were addressed in a meeting with Groves and Conant, and he accepted their point of view. "I am now convinced," he wrote, "that the very special circumstances arising from the nature of the project, and of its organization, demand special treatment, and a report of this kind may well be necessary to maintain security of the really essential facts of the project."

A thousand copies of the report were printed by <a href="lithography">lithography</a> at <a href="the%20Pentagon">the Pentagon</a>, and deposited in Groves's office in the <a href="Harry%20S%20Truman%20Building">New War Department Building</a> in Washington, DC, where they were kept securely locked away. Final approval was sought from the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a>, <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a>, in a meeting at the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> on August 9, 1945, three days after the <a href="bombing%20of%20Hiroshima">bombing of Hiroshima</a>. Stimson, Harrison, Groves, Conant, <a href="Vannevar%20Bush">Vannevar Bush</a>, and <a href="Fleet%20Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Fleet Admiral</a> <a href="William%20D.%20Leahy">William D. Leahy</a> presented their views, and Truman authorized the immediate release of the report. The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a> released the thousand copies of the report that had been kept in Groves's office to the media for use by the radio broadcasters with an embargo time of 9:00 pm on August 11, 1945, and for the newspapers of August 12.
The original title of the report, before it was published in book form, was "Nuclear Bombs: A General Account of the Development of Methods of Using Nuclear Energy for Military Purposes Under the Auspices of the United States Government, 1940–1945". The word "nuclear" was changed to "atomic" because while the former was favoured by physicists, it was not in common use by the general public at that time. This was the title used on the copyright certificate. The book was copyrighted to Smyth but issued with the statement that "reproduction in whole or in part is authorized and permitted". Groves had the report copyrighted by Smyth in order to prevent someone else from copyrighting it.

Groves was concerned about the security implications of the title, so instead of having "Atomic Bombs" on the cover, it was left blank, and a <a href="rubber%20stamp">rubber stamp</a> was made. The intention was for this to be used on each copy before it was distributed. This was done for the copyright deposit copies, but not those given to the press or the public. The lumbering subtitle therefore became the title. A side effect of this was that it became generally known as the "Smyth Report". Over the years, the term "nuclear" gradually gained traction, and by 1960 it had become more common than "atomic".

In mid-1945, Smyth approached Datus C. Smith, the director of <a href="Princeton%20University%20Press">Princeton University Press</a>, about the possibility of renting his printing plant to the government during a two-week summer shutdown so that Smyth could produce 5,000 copies of a top secret report. Smith’s response was that he found it hard to imagine anyone needing to print 5,000 copies of a top secret report. He found it much easier to imagine delays due to unexpected printing problems, and his workers returning from summer vacation to find themselves locked out of a plant filled with top secret material. Under the circumstances, he felt that he could not risk this.

After the Smyth Report was officially released, Smith immediately offered to publish it. Smyth patiently explained that anyone was free to publish it, but Princeton University Press was only willing to do so on the understanding that this would be "Smyth's edition". Meanwhile, Smyth approached <a href="McGraw%20Hill%20Financial">McGraw-Hill</a> about publishing it. The editors at McGraw-Hill found the manuscript dull and somewhat technical for a general audience and suggested a rewrite. Smyth balked at this, as it would have meant going through the censorship process again. James S. Thompson, the president of McGraw-Hill, pointed out the <a href="U.S.%20Government%20Printing%20Office">U.S. Government Printing Office</a> would be putting out an edition, probably more cheaply than he could, and there would likely be little profit in a McGraw-Hill edition. Smyth then turned back to Princeton University Press. He had only one condition: that he receive no royalties. Princeton University Press agreed, but added a stipulation of its own: that Groves's approval be secured. Smyth obtained this in a letter dated August 25, 1945.
Princeton University Press received a copy of the typescript lithograph edition with hand corrections from Smyth on August 17, 1945. The <a href="typographer">typographer</a>s had already started work from another copy. Maple Press of <a href="York%2C%20Pennsylvania">York, Pennsylvania</a>, was lined up to do the printing. Because of wartime shortages, one of a publisher’s biggest worries was finding adequate supplies of paper. Smith approached Manny and Leonard Relles from Central Paper, told them about the Smyth Report and its significance, and asked them if they could deliver of paper to Maple Press in twelve days. They found a <a href="Goods%20wagon">carload</a> of paper on a <a href="Siding%20%28rail%29">siding</a> in New England and sent it to York, providing enough paper for 30,000 copies, only half what Princeton University Press wanted. The first edition of 30,000 copies was printing when word was received that paper had been found for another 30,000 copies. The presses were held for three hours while the train made its way to a siding in York, where the paper was unloaded and brought to the printing plant by trucks.

There were minor differences between the original text and the version published by Princeton. In the Princeton publication, first and middle names were added instead of the previous use of abbreviations. In response to public concerns about radioactivity, Groves had text added to paragraph 12.18 explaining how the height of the explosions over Hiroshima and Nagasaki reduced <a href="fallout">fallout</a> and allowed <a href="fission%20products">fission products</a> to be drawn up into the upper atmosphere. He also had a one-sentence allusion to a <a href="neutron%20poison">poisoning effect</a> of fission products in the production reactors redacted. This deletion was soon noticed by the Russian translators, and only served to highlight its importance to the <a href="Soviet%20atomic%20bomb%20project">Soviet atomic bomb project</a>.

Later editions also incorporated changes. Four typographical errors were found, and the word "<a href="photon">photon</a>" in paragraph 1.44 aroused so much correspondence from readers who mistakenly believed that it should be "<a href="proton">proton</a>" that it was decided to re-word the paragraph. The British government became concerned that the Smyth report did not cover the British part in the project, and issued its own 40-page report, which was incorporated into the fifth printing in November 1945 as Appendix 7. A two-page report by the Canadian government was added as Appendix 8.

The Smyth Report was translated into over 40 different languages. In addition to Princeton University Press, it was also published by the Government Printing Office, the "Infantry Journal", and <a href="His%20Majesty%27s%20Stationery%20Office">His Majesty's Stationery Office</a>, and was reprinted in the October 1945 issue of "<a href="Reviews%20of%20Modern%20Physics">Reviews of Modern Physics</a>".

The first copies were delivered to bookstores on September 10. Many were wary of it, due to its technical nature, and feared that sales would be low. An exception was <a href="Scribner%27s%20Bookstores">Scribner's Bookstores</a>, which placed large early orders. At Oak Ridge, the Manhattan Project's major production site, 8,000 copies were sold through the employee welfare organization. Similar arrangements were made for Los Alamos and Richland, which were located in areas where bookstores were scarce.

The Smyth Report was on "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" <a href="bestseller">bestseller</a> list from October 14, 1945, until January 20, 1946. Between 1946 and when the Smyth Report went out of print in 1973, it went through eight printings, and Princeton University Press sold 62,612 paperback and 64,129 hardback copies.

Groves did not intend the Smyth Report to be the last word on the project. It formed an addendum to the "Manhattan District History", the official history of the project. This eventually consisted of 35 volumes with 39 appendices or supplements. It was written in the immediate postwar years by the chemists, metallurgists, physicists, and administrators who had worked on the project. Since there were no security restrictions, it covered every aspect of the Manhattan Project, but was itself classified. Most of it was declassified in the 1960s and 1970s and became available to scholars, except for some technical details on the construction of the bombs.

In her 2008 <a href="PhD">PhD</a> dissertation, Rebecca Schwartz argued that Smyth's academic background and the Smyth Report's security-driven focus on physics at the expense of chemistry, metallurgy, and ordnance promoted a public perception of the Manhattan Project as primarily the achievement of physics and physicists. According to Schwartz, postwar histories and popular writing tended to follow the Smyth report in this regard, creating a lasting historiographical legacy. "Ever since", wrote Jon Agar, "the atomic bomb has been seen as an achievement of physics." In particular, the prominence given to Einstein's <a href="mass%E2%80%93energy%20equivalence">mass–energy equivalence</a> equation indelibly associated it with the Manhattan Project. The Smyth Report, wrote <a href="Robert%20P.%20Crease">Robert P. Crease</a>, "more than any other single document made an emblem of atomic energy and weaponry."

Groves felt that:

Bill Newton

William Ellis (Bill) Newton, <a href="Victoria%20Cross">VC</a> (8 June 1919 – 29 March 1943) was an <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20Victoria%20Cross%20recipients">Australian recipient</a> of the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, the highest decoration for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to a member of the <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> and <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> armed forces. He was honoured for his actions as a bomber pilot in <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a> during March 1943 when, despite intense <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft fire</a>, he pressed home a series of attacks on the <a href="Salamaua">Salamaua Isthmus</a>, the last of which saw him forced to <a href="Water%20landing">ditch</a> his aircraft in the sea. Newton was still officially posted as missing when the award was made in October 1943. It later emerged that he had been taken captive by the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a>, and executed by <a href="beheading">beheading</a> on 29 March.

Raised in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, Newton excelled at sport, playing cricket at youth state level. He joined the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Citizen Military Forces</a> in 1938, and enlisted in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) in February 1940. Described as having the dash of "an <a href="Errol%20Flynn">Errol Flynn</a> or a <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a>", Newton served as a <a href="Flight%20instructor">flying instructor</a> in Australia before being posted to <a href="No.%2022%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 22 Squadron</a>, which began operating <a href="Douglas%20A-20%20Havoc">Boston</a> light bombers in New Guinea late in 1942. Having just taken part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bismarck%20Sea">Battle of the Bismarck Sea</a>, he was on his fifty-second mission when he was shot down and captured. Newton was the only Australian airman to receive a Victoria Cross for action in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">South West Pacific theatre of World War II</a>, and the sole Australian to be so decorated while flying with an RAAF squadron.

Born in the <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> suburb of <a href="St%20Kilda%2C%20Victoria">St Kilda</a> on 8 June 1919, Bill Newton was the youngest child of dentist Charles Ellis Newton and his second wife Minnie. His three older half-siblings from Charles' earlier marriage included two brothers, John and Lindsay, and a sister, Phyllis. Bill entered <a href="Melbourne%20Grammar%20School">Melbourne Grammar School</a> in 1929, but two years later switched to the nearby St Kilda Park Central School as the family income was reduced through the impact of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. In 1934, aged fifteen, he was able to return to Melbourne Grammar where, despite struggling with his schoolwork, he completed his <a href="Intermediate%20Certificate%20%28Australia%29">Intermediate certificate</a>. He gave up further study when his father died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of fifty-one, and began working in a silk warehouse.

Considered while at school to be a future leader in the community, Newton was also a talented all-round sportsman, playing <a href="cricket">cricket</a>, <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">Australian rules football</a>, golf and water polo. A <a href="fast%20bowling">fast bowler</a> in cricket, he was friends with <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a>, and collected the <a href="Cricket%20Victoria">Victorian Cricket Association</a> (VCA) <a href="VCA%20Colts%20cricket%20team">Colts</a> bowling trophy for 1937–38, while Miller collected the equivalent batting prize. In January 1938, Newton dismissed <a href="Test%20cricket">Test</a> batsman <a href="Bill%20Ponsford">Bill Ponsford</a>—still the only Australian to twice score 400 in a <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class innings</a>—for four in a Colts game at the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a>. The following year, he gained selection in the <a href="Victorian%20cricket%20team">Victorian Second XI</a>. He opened the bowling against the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales Second XI</a>—his first and only match—taking a total of 3/113 including the wickets of <a href="Ron%20Saggers">Ron Saggers</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> who, like Miller, went on to become members of the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">"Invincibles"</a>.

Newton had been a <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a> in his <a href="Australian%20Army%20Cadets">cadet corps</a> at school, and joined the <a href="Citizens%20Military%20Force">Citizens Military Force</a> on 28 November 1938, serving as a <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a> in the machine-gun section of the <a href="6th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29%23Inter%20war%20years">6th Battalion, Royal Melbourne Regiment</a>. Still employed in the silk warehouse when World War II broke out in September 1939, he resigned to join the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) on 5 February 1940. He had earlier attempted to enlist when he turned eighteen in 1937, but his mother refused to give her permission; with Australia now at war, she acquiesced. His brothers—dentists by profession, like their father—also enlisted in the armed forces, John as a <a href="Lieutenant">surgeon lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> and Lindsay as a <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Army%20Medical%20Corps">Army Medical Corps</a>.
Newton undertook his initial training with <a href="No.%201%20Elementary%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Elementary Flying Training School</a> in <a href="Parafield%20Airport">Parafield</a>, South Australia, flying <a href="De%20Havilland%20Tiger%20Moth">De Havilland Tiger Moth</a>s, and with <a href="No.%2021%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 21 (City of Melbourne) Squadron</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Station Laverton</a>, Victoria, flying <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">CAC Wirraway</a>s. He was awarded his <a href="Aircrew%20brevet">wings</a> and commissioned as a <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> on 28 June 1940. Following advanced training on <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s with <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Service Flying Training School</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">RAAF Point Cook</a> in September, he was selected to become a <a href="flight%20instructor">flight instructor</a>. He completed the requisite course at <a href="Central%20Flying%20School%20RAAF">Central Flying School</a> in <a href="Camden%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Camden</a>, New South Wales, and was promoted to <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> on 28 December. He subsequently began training students under the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a> at <a href="No.%202%20Service%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 2 Service Flying Training School</a> near <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Wagga">Wagga Wagga</a>, under the command of Group Captain <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Frederick Scherger</a>.

In October 1941, Newton transferred to <a href="No.%205%20Service%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 5 Service Flying Training School</a> at <a href="Uranquinty">Uranquinty</a>. He found instruction frustrating, as he longed for a combat assignment. His fortunes changed in February 1942, when he was selected for the navigation course on Ansons at the General Reconnaissance School based at Laverton. From there he was sent to <a href="No.%201%20Operational%20Training%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 1 Operational Training Unit</a> at <a href="Sale%2C%20Victoria">Sale</a>, Victoria, for conversion to <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a> twin-engined light bombers during March and April.

Promoted to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> on 1 April 1942, Newton was posted the following month to <a href="No.%2022%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 22 (City of Sydney) Squadron</a>, based at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a>, New South Wales. Previously equipped with Hudsons, the unit had just begun converting to the more advanced <a href="Douglas%20A-20%20Havoc">Douglas Boston</a> when Newton arrived. A comrade described him as a "big brash, likeable man who could drink most of us under the table, was a good pilot, good at sports, and had a way with girls". No. 22 Squadron was engaged in <a href="Convoy">convoy escort</a> and <a href="anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine patrols</a> off <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> from July to September, before moving north to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Townsville">Townsville</a>, Queensland. In November, it was deployed to <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a> in Papua New Guinea, under the control of <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B9%20Operational%20Group%20RAAF">No. 9 Operational Group RAAF</a>.

Newton undertook the first of his fifty-two operational <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s on 1 January 1943, under the leadership of his commanding officer, <a href="Squadron%20Leader">Squadron Leader</a> Keith Hampshire. During February, Newton flew low-level missions through <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a> conditions and hazardous mountain terrain, attacking Japanese forces ranged against Allied troops in the <a href="Morobe%20Province">Morobe</a> province. In early March, he took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bismarck%20Sea">Battle of the Bismarck Sea</a>, one of the key engagements in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific theatre</a>, bombing and strafing <a href="Lae">Lae</a> airfield to prevent its force of enemy fighters taking off to intercept Allied aircraft attacking the Japanese fleet. Newton gained a reputation for driving straight at his targets without evasive manoeuvre, and always leaving them in flames; this earned him the nickname "The Firebug". The Japanese gunners, however, reportedly knew him as "Blue Cap", from his habit of wearing an old blue cricket cap on operations. In spite of the hazards of the air war in New Guinea, he was quoted as saying, "The troops on the ground should get two medals each, before any airman gets one".

On 16 March 1943, Newton led a sortie on the <a href="Salamaua">Salamaua Isthmus</a> in which his Boston was hit repeatedly by Japanese anti-aircraft fire, damaging fuselage, wings, fuel tanks and undercarriage. In spite of this he continued his attack and dropped his bombs at low level on buildings, ammunition dumps and fuel stores, returning for a second pass at the target in order to strafe it with machine-gun fire. Newton managed to get his crippled machine back to base, where it was found to be marked with ninety-eight bullet holes. Two days later, he and his two-man crew made a further attack on Salamaua with five other Bostons. As he bombed his designated target, Newton's plane was seen to burst into flames, raked by cannon fire from the ground. Attempting to keep his aircraft aloft as long as possible to get his crew away from enemy lines, he was able to <a href="Water%20landing">ditch</a> in the sea approximately offshore.

The Boston's <a href="navigator">navigator</a>, Sergeant Basil Eastwood, was killed in the forced landing but Newton and his <a href="Radio">wireless operator</a>, <a href="Flight%20Sergeant">Flight Sergeant</a> John Lyon, survived and managed to swim ashore. Several of the other aircraft in the flight circled the area; one returned to base straight away to inform Hampshire, and the remainder were later forced to depart through lack of fuel. Newton and Lyon originally made their way inland with the help of natives, aiming to contact an Australian <a href="Coastwatchers">Coastwatcher</a>, but subsequently returned to the coast. There they were captured by a Japanese patrol of No. 5 Special Naval Landing Force. The two airmen were taken to Salamaua and interrogated until 20 March, before being moved to Lae where Lyon was <a href="bayonet">bayonet</a>ed to death on the orders of <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> Ruitaro Fujita, the senior Japanese commander in the area. Newton was taken back to Salamaua where, on 29 March 1943, he was ceremonially beheaded with a <a href="Katana">Samurai sword</a> by <a href="Sub-Lieutenant">Sub-Lieutenant</a> Uichi Komai, the naval officer who had captured him. Komai was killed in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> soon after, and Fujita committed suicide at the end of the war.

It was initially believed that Newton had failed to escape from the Boston after it ditched into the sea, and he was posted as missing. Squadron Leader Hampshire had immediately dispatched a sortie to recover the pair that were last seen swimming for shore, but no sign of them was found. Two weeks later, he wrote a letter to Newton's mother in which he described her son's courage and expressed the hope that he might yet be found alive. Hampshire concluded, "Bill is one of those rare fellows I shall miss for a long time, and if it is to be, remember for an age". The details of his capture and execution were only revealed later that year in a diary found on a Japanese soldier. Newton was not specifically named, but circumstantial evidence clearly identified him, as the diary entry recorded the beheading of an Australian flight lieutenant who had been shot down by anti-aircraft fire on 18 March 1943 while flying a Douglas aircraft. The Japanese observer described the prisoner as "composed" in the face of his impending execution, and "unshaken to the last". After the decapitation, a seaman slashed open the dead man's stomach, declaring "Something for the other day. Take that."

General Headquarters South West Pacific Area, while releasing details of the execution on 5 October, initially refused to name Newton. Aside from the lack of absolute certainty as to identification, Air Vice Marshal <a href="William%20Bostock">Bill Bostock</a>, Air Officer Commanding <a href="RAAF%20Command">RAAF Command</a>, contended that naming him would change the impact of the news upon Newton's fellow No. 22 Squadron members "from the impersonal to the closely personal" and hence "seriously affect morale". News of the atrocity provoked shock in Australia. In an attempt to alleviate anxiety among the families of other missing airmen, the Federal government announced on 12 October that the relatives of the slain man had been informed of his death.

Newton was awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> for his actions on 16–18 March, becoming the only Australian airman to earn the decoration in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II, and the only one while flying with an RAAF squadron. The citation, which incorrectly implied that he was shot down on 17 March rather than the following day, and as having failed to escape from his sinking aircraft, was promulgated in the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 19 October 1943:

Buried initially in an unmarked bomb crater in Salamaua, Newton's body was recovered and re-interred in <a href="Lae%20War%20Cemetery">Lae War Cemetery</a> after Salamaua's capture by Allied troops in September 1943. In early 1944, the recently constructed No. 4 Airfield in <a href="Nadzab">Nadzab</a> was renamed Newton Field in his honour. For many years, the story of Newton's death was intertwined with that of an <a href="Australian%20commandos%23M%20%26amp%3B%20Z%20Special%20Units">Australian commando</a>, Sergeant <a href="Leonard%20Siffleet">Len Siffleet</a>, who had also been captured in New Guinea. A famous photograph showing Siffleet about to be executed with a <a href="katana">katana</a> was discovered by American troops in April 1944 and was thought to have depicted Newton in Salamaua. However, no photograph of the airman's execution is known to exist.

Newton's mother Minnie was presented with her son's Victoria Cross by the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General</a>, the <a href="Prince%20Henry%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Duke of Gloucester</a>, on 30 November 1945. She donated it to the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a>, Canberra, where it remains on display with his other medals. Newton is also commemorated on Canberra's <a href="Remembrance%20Driveway%20%28Australia%29">Remembrance Driveway</a>. In the 1990s, his friend Keith Miller successfully fought to ensure that the <a href="Victoria%20Racing%20Club">Victoria Racing Club</a> abandoned a plan to rename the William Ellis Newton Steeplechase—run on <a href="Anzac%20Day">Anzac Day</a>—after a commercial sponsor. Later in the decade, Miller also publicly questioned <a href="Australia%20Post">Australia Post</a>'s exclusion of Newton from a series of stamps featuring notable Australians such as cricketer <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Sir Donald Bradman</a>. A plaque dedicated to No. 22 Squadron was unveiled at the Australian War Memorial by the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of Air Force</a>, Air Marshal <a href="Angus%20Houston">Angus Houston</a>, on 16 March 2003, the sixtieth anniversary of Newton's attack on Salamaua.

United States v. Washington

United States v. Washington, 384 F. Supp. 312 (W.D. Wash. 1974), aff'd, 520 F.2d 676 (9th Cir. 1975), commonly known as the Boldt Decision (from the name of the trial court judge, <a href="George%20Hugo%20Boldt">George Hugo Boldt</a>), was a 1974 case heard in the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Western%20District%20of%20Washington">United States District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Ninth%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a>. It reaffirmed the reserved right of <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">American Indian</a> tribes in the <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">State of Washington</a> to act alongside the state as co-managers of <a href="salmon">salmon</a> and other fish, and to continue harvesting them in accordance with the various treaties that the United States had signed with the tribes. The tribes of Washington had ceded their land to the United States but had reserved the right to fish as they had always done, including fishing at their traditional locations that were off the designated <a href="Indian%20reservation">reservations</a>.

Over time, the state of Washington had infringed on the treaty rights of the tribes despite losing a series of court cases on the issue. Those cases provided the Indians a right of access through private property to their fishing locations, and said that the state could neither charge Indians a fee to fish nor discriminate against the tribes in the method of fishing allowed. Those cases also provided for the Indians' rights to a fair and equitable share of the harvest. The Boldt decision further defined that reserved right, holding that the tribes were entitled to half the fish harvest each year.

In 1975 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Judge Boldt's ruling. The <a href="U.S.%20Supreme%20Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> declined to hear the case. After the state refused to enforce the court order, Judge Boldt ordered the <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> and federal law enforcement agencies to enforce his rulings. On July 2, 1979, the Supreme Court rejected a <a href="collateral%20attack">collateral attack</a> on the case, largely endorsing Judge Boldt's ruling and the opinion of the Ninth Circuit. In "<a href="Washington%20v.%20Washington%20State%20Commercial%20Passenger%20Fishing%20Vessel%20Ass%27n">Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Ass'n</a>", Justice <a href="John%20Paul%20Stevens">John Paul Stevens</a> wrote that "[b]oth sides have a right, secured by treaty, to take a fair share of the available fish." The Supreme Court also endorsed Boldt's orders to enforce his rulings by the use of federal law enforcement assets and the Coast Guard.

The American Indians of the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> had long depended on the salmon harvest, a resource which allowed them to become the wealthiest North American tribes. The salmon harvest for the <a href="Columbia%20River%20Drainage%20Basin">Columbia River basin</a> was estimated at annually, which not only provided sufficient salmon for the tribes' needs, but also enough to trade with others. By the 1840s, tribes were trading salmon to the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> which shipped the fish to New York, Great Britain, and other locations around the world.

In the 1850s, the United States government entered into a series of treaties with the American Indian tribes of the Pacific Northwest. In the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Olympia">Treaty of Olympia</a>, territorial governor <a href="Isaac%20I.%20Stevens">Isaac I. Stevens</a> agreed that the tribes had rights including:

The right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed grounds and stations is secured to said Indians in common with all citizens of the Territory, and of erecting temporary houses for the purpose of curing the same; together with the privilege of hunting, gathering roots and berries, and pasturing their horses on all open and unclaimed lands. Provided, however, That they shall not take shell-fish from any beds staked or cultivated by citizens; and provided, also, that they shall alter all stallions not intended for breeding, and keep up and confine the stallions themselves.

Other agreements with area tribes included the treaties of <a href="Treaty%20of%20Medicine%20Creek">Medicine Creek</a>, <a href="Treaty%20of%20Point%20Elliott">Point Elliott</a>, <a href="Treaty%20of%20Neah%20Bay">Neah Bay</a>, and <a href="Treaty%20of%20Point%20No%20Point">Point No Point</a>. All of these had similar language on the rights of the Indians to fish outside the reservation. While the tribes agreed to part with their land, they insisted on protecting their fishing rights throughout the <a href="Washington%20territory">Washington territory</a>.

Initially, the federal government honored its treaties with the tribes, but with increasing numbers of white settlers moving into the area, the settlers began to infringe upon the fishing rights of the native tribes. By 1883, whites had established more than forty salmon canneries. In 1894, there were three canneries in the <a href="Puget%20Sound">Puget Sound</a> area; by 1905 there were twenty-four. The whites also began to use new techniques that prevented a significant portion of the salmon from reaching the tribal fishing areas. When Washington Territory became a state in 1889, the legislature passed "laws to curtail tribal fishing in the name of 'conservation' but what some scholars described as being designed to protect white fisheries". The state legislature, by 1897, had banned the use of <a href="weirs">weirs</a>, which were customarily used by Indians. The tribes turned to the courts for enforcement of their rights under the treaties.

In one of the earliest of these enforcement cases, decided in 1887, the United States <a href="Indian%20Agent">Indian Agent</a> and several members of the <a href="Yakima%20tribe">Yakima tribe</a> filed suit in territorial court to enforce their right of access to off-reservation fishing locations. Frank Taylor, a non-Indian settler, had obtained land from the United States and had fenced off the land, preventing access by the Yakima to their traditional fishing locations. Although the trial court ruled in Taylor's favor, the Supreme Court of the <a href="Washington%20Territory">Territory of Washington</a> reversed and held that the tribe had reserved its own rights to fish, thereby creating an <a href="easement">easement</a> or an <a href="equitable%20servitude">equitable servitude</a> of the land that was not extinguished when Taylor obtained title.

Within ten years, another case arose, which dealt with fishing rights at <a href="Celilo%20Falls">Celilo Falls</a>, a traditional Indian fishing location. Two brothers, Lineas and Audubon Winans, owned property on both sides of the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> and obtained licenses from the state of Washington to operate four <a href="fish%20wheel">fish wheel</a>s. The wheels prevented a significant number of salmon from passing the location. Additionally, the Winans prohibited anyone, whether an Indian with treaty rights or otherwise, from crossing their land to get to the falls.

The <a href="United%20States%20Attorney">United States Attorney</a> for Washington then filed a suit to enforce the treaty rights of the tribe. The trial court held that the property rights of the Winans allowed them to exclude others from the property, including the Indians. In 1905, the United States Supreme Court reversed that decision, holding that the tribe had reserved fishing rights when they ceded the property to the United States. Since the tribes had the right to fish reserved in the treaties, the federal government and subsequent owners had no greater property rights than were granted by the treaties.

In 1914, the United States sued again, this time against the Seufert Brothers Company which had prevented Yakima Indians including Sam Williams from fishing on the Oregon side of the Columbia River near the Celilo Falls. After the United States sued on behalf of Williams, the United States District Court in Oregon issued an injunction which the Supreme Court affirmed, again holding that the treaties created a servitude that ran with the land. This decision was significant in that it expanded the hunting and fishing rights outside the territory ceded by the tribes when it was shown that the tribe used the area for hunting and fishing.

In "<a href="Tulee%20v.%20Washington">Tulee v. Washington</a>", the United States Supreme Court once again ruled on the treaty rights of the Yakima tribe. In 1939, Sampson Tulee, a Yakima, was arrested for fishing without a state fishing license. The United States government immediately filed for a writ of "<a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>" on Tulee's behalf, which was denied on procedural grounds because he had not yet been tried in state court and had not exhausted his appeals. Tulee was convicted in state court, which was upheld by the <a href="Washington%20Supreme%20Court">Washington Supreme Court</a> on the grounds that the state's sovereignty allowed it to impose a fee on Indians who were fishing outside the reservation. The United States Supreme Court reversed, stating "we are of the opinion that the state is without power to charge the Yakimas a fee for fishing".

Following the "Tulee" decision, there were three United States Supreme Court decisions involving the <a href="Puyallup%20tribe">Puyallup tribe</a>. The first was "<a href="Puyallup%20Tribe%20v.%20Department%20of%20Game%20of%20Washington">Puyallup Tribe v. Department of Game of Washington</a>," ("Puyallup I") which involved a state ban on the use of nets to catch <a href="Rainbow%20trout">steelhead trout</a> and salmon. Despite the ban, the tribes continued to use nets based on their treaty rights. Justice <a href="William%20O.%20Douglas">William Douglas</a> delivered the opinion of the Court which said that the treaty did not prevent state regulations that were reasonable and necessary under a fish conservation scheme, provided the regulation was not discriminatory.

After being remanded to determine if the regulations were not discriminatory, the case returned to the United States Supreme Court in "<a href="Department%20of%20Game%20of%20Washington%20v.%20Puyallup%20Tribe">Department of Game of Washington v. Puyallup Tribe</a>" ("Puyallyp II"). Again, Justice Douglas wrote the opinion for the Court, but this time he struck down the state restrictions as discriminatory. Douglas noted that the restrictions for catching steelhead trout with nets had remained, and was a method used only by the Indians, whereas hook and line fishing was allowed but was used only by non-Indians. As such, the effect of the regulation allocated all of the steelhead trout fishing to sport anglers, and none to the tribes.

The third case, "<a href="Puyallup%20Tribe%2C%20Inc.%20v.%20Department%20of%20Game%20of%20Washington">Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of Washington</a>" ("Puyallup III"), was decided in 1977. Members of the Puyallup Tribe filed suit, arguing that under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, Washington state courts lacked jurisdiction to regulate fishing activities on tribal reservations. Writing for a majority of the Court, Justice <a href="John%20Paul%20Stevens">John Paul Stevens</a> held that, despite the tribe's <a href="sovereign%20immunity">sovereign immunity</a>, the state could regulate the harvest of steelhead trout in the portion of the river that ran through the <a href="Puyallup%20Reservation">Puyallup Reservation</a> as long as the state could base its decision and apportionment on conservation grounds.

One year after the "Puyallup I" decision, Judge <a href="Robert%20C.%20Belloni">Robert C. Belloni</a> issued an order in "<a href="Sohappy%20v.%20Smith">Sohappy v. Smith</a>", a treaty fishing case involving the Yakima tribe and the state of Oregon. In this case, Oregon had discriminated against the Indians in favor of sports and commercial fishermen, allocating almost nothing to the tribes at the headwaters of the river. Oregon argued that the treaties only gave the Indians the same rights as every other citizen, and Belloni noted that "[s]uch a reading would not seem unreasonable if all history, anthropology, biology, prior case law and the intention of the parties to the treaty were to be ignored". Belloni also found that:

The state may regulate fishing by non-Indians to achieve a wide variety of management or "conservation" objectives. Its selection of regulations to achieve these objectives is limited only by its own organic law and the standards of reasonableness required by the Fourteenth Amendment. But when it is regulating the federal right of Indians to take fish at their usual and accustomed places it does not have the same latitude in prescribing the management objectives and the regulatory means of achieving them. The state may not qualify the federal right by subordinating it to some other state objective or policy. It may use its police power only to the extent necessary to prevent the exercise of that right in a manner that will imperil the continued existence of the fish resource.

Belloni issued a final ruling that the tribes were entitled to a fair and equitable portion of the fish harvest. The court retained <a href="continuing%20jurisdiction">continuing jurisdiction</a>, and his order was not appealed.

Although the Belloni decision established the rights of the Indians to exercise their treaty fishing rights, the states of Oregon and Washington continued to arrest Indians for violations of state law and regulations that infringed on those rights. In September 1970, the United States Attorney filed an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington alleging that the state of Washington had infringed on the treaty rights of the <a href="Hoh%20Indian%20Tribe%20of%20the%20Hoh%20Indian%20Reservation">Hoh</a>, <a href="Makah">Makah</a>, <a href="Muckleshoot">Muckleshoot</a>, <a href="Nisqually%20Indian%20Tribe%20of%20the%20Nisqually%20Reservation">Nisqually</a>, Puyallup, <a href="Quileute">Quileute</a>, and <a href="Skokomish%20Indian%20Tribe">Skokomish</a> tribes. Later, the <a href="Lummi">Lummi</a>, <a href="Quinault%20people">Quinault</a>, <a href="Sauk-Suiattle%20Indian%20Tribe%20of%20Washington">Sauk-Suiattle</a>, <a href="Squaxin%20Island%20Tribe">Squaxin Island</a>, <a href="Stillaguamish%20Tribe%20of%20Indians%20of%20Washington">Stillaguamish</a>, <a href="Upper%20Skagit%20Indian%20Tribe">Upper Skagit</a>, and <a href="Yakama%20Indian%20Reservation">Yakima</a> tribes <a href="Intervention%20%28law%29">intervened</a> in the case. Defendants were the state of Washington, the Washington Department of Fisheries, the Washington Game Commission, and the Washington Reef Net Owners Association.

The first phase of the case took three years, mainly in preparation for trial. During the trial, Boldt heard testimony from about fifty witnesses and admitted 350 exhibits. The evidence showed that the state had shut down many sites used by Indians for net fishing while allowing commercial net fishing elsewhere on the same run. At most, the tribes took only about two percent (2%) of the total harvest. There was no evidence presented by the state that showed any detrimental actions by Indians toward the harvest. Both expert testimony and cultural testimony was presented, with tribal members relating the oral history dealing with the treaties and fishing rights. Additionally, Boldt found that the tribe's witnesses were more credible than those of the state, finding that the tribe's expert witnesses were "exceptionally well researched".

The court held that, when the tribes conveyed millions of acres of land in Washington State through a series of treaties signed in 1854 and 1855, they reserved the <a href="Treaty%20rights">right</a> to continue fishing. The court looked at the <a href="minutes">minutes</a> of the treaty negotiations to interpret the meaning of the treaty language "<a href="Concurrent%20estate%23Tenancy%20in%20common">in common with</a>" as the United States described it to the Tribes, holding that the United States intended for there to be an equal sharing of the fish resource between the Tribes and the settlers. As the court stated, the phrase means "sharing equally the opportunity to take fish ... therefore, nontreaty fishermen shall have the opportunity to take up to 50% of the harvestable number of fish ... and treaty right fishermen shall have the opportunity to take up to the same percentage". The formula used by Boldt gave the tribes forty-three percent (43%) of the Puget Sound harvest, which was equivalent to eighteen percent (18%) of the statewide harvest. The order required the state to limit the amount of fish taken by non-Indian commercial fishermen, causing a drop in their income from about $15,000–20,000 to $500–2,000.

Furthermore, the court also held the state could regulate the Indians' exercise of their treaty rights, but only to ensure the "perpetuation of a run or of a species of fish". To regulate the Indians, the state must be able to show that conservation could not be achieved by regulating only the non-Indians, must not discriminate against the Indians, and must use appropriate <a href="due%20process">due process</a>.

After the District Court issued its ruling, both sides submitted appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Washington argued that the district court had no power to invalidate state fishing regulations, while the tribes argued "the state may not regulate their fishing activities at treaty locations for any reason". Writing for a majority of the court, Circuit Court Judge <a href="Herbert%20Choy">Herbert Choy</a> affirmed Judge Boldt's opinion "in all respects", but clarified that Judge Boldt's "equitable apportionment" of harvestable fish did not apply to "fish caught by non-Washington citizens outside the state's jurisdiction".

In his majority opinion, Judge Choy emphasized that states may not enact regulations that are "in conflict with treaties in force between the United States and the Indian nations". Consequently, he concluded that the treaties signed in the 1850s expressly preempted Washington's regulations and that non-Indians had "only a limited right to fish at treaty places." Judge Choy also emphasized that the tribes were "entitled to an equitable apportionment of the opportunity to fish in order to safeguard their federal treaty rights" and that the Ninth Circuit should grant the district court a "great amount of discretion as a court of equity" when apportioning rights to fisheries. He held that the district court's apportionment "was well within its discretion", but clarified that tribes were not entitled to compensation for "unanticipated heavy fishing" that occurred off Washington's coast. Judge Choy also clarified that the district court's equitable remedy should attempt to minimize hardships for white reef net fishermen.

District court judge <a href="James%20M.%20Burns%20%28judge%29">James M. Burns</a>, sitting by designation, wrote a separate concurring opinion in which he criticized the "recalcitrance of Washington State officials" in their management of the state's fisheries. Judge Burns argued that Washington's recalcitrance forced Judge Boldt to act as "perpetual fishmaster" and noted that he "deplore[d]" situations in which district court judges are forced to act as "enduring managers of the fisheries, forests, and highways". In his concluding remarks, Judge Burns argued that Washington's responsibility to manage its natural resources "should neither escape notice nor be forgotten."

After the Ninth Circuit issued its ruling in the direct appeal, the case was <a href="Remand%20%28court%20procedure%29">remanded</a> to the district court for further proceedings. Washington submitted an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, but the Supreme Court denied the state's petition for certiorari and subsequent petition for rehearing. Despite these rulings, the parties in the original case continued to litigate issues relating to apportionment of the fisheries and subsequent rulings have been issued as recently as May 2015.

After Boldt's decision, the Washington Department of Fisheries issued new regulations in compliance with the decision. The Puget Sound Gillnetters Association and the Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association both filed lawsuits in state court to block the new regulations. These private concerns won at both the trial court and at the Washington Supreme Court. <a href="Washington%20Attorney%20General">Washington Attorney General</a> <a href="Slade%20Gorton">Slade Gorton</a>, representing the state of Washington, supported the position of the private concerns and opposed the position of the United States and the tribes. The United States Supreme Court granted "certiorari" and <a href="Vacated%20judgment">vacated</a> the decision of the Washington Supreme Court.

Justice John Paul Stevens announced the decision of the Court, which upheld Judge Boldt's order and overturned the rulings of the state courts. Stevens made it explicitly clear that Boldt could issue the orders he did, stating "[t]he federal court unquestionably has the power to enter the various orders that state official and private parties have chosen to ignore, and even to displace local enforcement of those orders if necessary to remedy the violations of federal law found by the court."

When the state would not enforce his order to reduce the catch of non-Indian commercial fishermen, Boldt took direct action, placing the matter under federal supervision. The <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> and the <a href="National%20Marine%20Fisheries%20Service">National Marine Fisheries Service</a> were ordered to enforce the ruling and soon had boats in the water confronting violators. Some of the protesters rammed Coast Guard boats and at least one member of the Coast Guard was shot. Those whom the officers caught breaking the court's orders were taken before federal magistrates and fined for contempt, and the illegal fishing as a protest stopped. The United States District Court continued to exercise jurisdiction over the matter, determining traditional fishing locations and compiling major orders of the court.

The case continued to have issues brought up before the district court. In what became known as "Phase II", District Judge <a href="William%20H.%20Orrick%2C%20Jr.">William H. Orrick, Jr.</a> heard the issues presented by the United States on behalf of the tribes. Following the hearing, Orrick enjoined the state of Washington from damaging the fishes' habitat, and included hatchery-raised fish in the allocation to Indians. The state of Washington appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed in part and reversed in part, allowing the hatchery fish to remain in the allocation, but leaving the habitat issue open.

In 2001, twenty-one northwest Washington tribes, joined by the United States filed a Request for Determination in U.S. District Court, asking the court to find that the State of Washington has a treaty-based duty to preserve fish runs and habitat sufficiently for the tribes to earn a "moderate living," and sought to compel the state to repair or replace culverts that impede salmon migration. On August 22, 2007, the district court issued a summary judgment order, holding that while culverts impeding andromadous fish migration are not the only factor diminishing their upstream habitat, in building and maintaining culverts that impede salmon migration, Washington State had diminished the size of salmon runs within the case area and thereby violated its obligation under the Stevens Treaties. On March 29, 2013, the court issued an injunction ordering the state to significantly increase the effort for removing state-owned culverts that block habitat for salmon and steelhead, and to replace the state-owned culverts that have the greatest adverse impact on the habitat of andromadous fish by 2030.

The State of Washington appealed the district court's decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On June 27, 2016, a three judge panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision and upheld the injunction. Washington State has estimated it will need to fix an average of 30 to 40 culverts a year to comply with the injunction.

Scholars consider the Boldt decision to be a landmark case in American Indian law, in the area of cooperative management of resources, for Indian treaty rights, internationally for aboriginal treaty rights, and tribal civil rights.

The decision caused an immediate negative reaction from some citizens of Washington. Bumper stickers reading "Can Judge Boldt, Not Salmon" appeared, and Boldt was hung in effigy at the federal courthouse. Non-Indian commercial fishermen ignored the ruling and the state was reluctant (or at times refused) to enforce the law. By 1978, Congressman <a href="John%20E.%20Cunningham">John E. Cunningham</a> tried to get a bill passed to abrogate the treaties, to break up Indian holdings, and stop giving the tribes "special consideration", but the effort failed. In 1984, Washington voters passed an <a href="initiative">initiative</a> ending "special rights" for Indians, but the state refused to enforce it as being preempted by federal law.

"United States v. Washington" was a landmark case in terms of <a href="Native%20American%20civil%20rights">Native American civil rights</a> and evoked strong emotions. According to former U.S. Representative <a href="Lloyd%20Meeds">Lloyd Meeds</a> of <a href="Everett%2C%20Washington">Everett</a>, "the fishing issue was to Washington state what busing was to the East" for <a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a> during the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>.

The tribes involved benefited greatly from the decision. Prior to Boldt's ruling, Indians collected less than five percent (5%) of the harvest, but by 1984, they were collecting forty-nine percent (49%). Tribal members became successful commercial fishermen, even expanding to marine fishing as far away as <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>. The tribes became co-managers of the fisheries along with the state, hiring fish biologists and staff to carry out those duties. The Makah tribe, based on the terms of the Neah Bay Treaty and the Boldt decision, took their first <a href="Gray%20whale">California gray whale</a> in over seventy years in 1999. Following a lawsuit by various animal rights activists, the tribe was allocated the right to take up to five whales a year for the 2001 and 2002 seasons.

Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway

The Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway (CL&N) was a local <a href="passenger%20railroad">passenger</a> and <a href="freight%20railroad">freight</a>-carrying <a href="railroad">railroad</a> in the southwestern part of the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, connecting <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a> to <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton</a> via <a href="Lebanon%2C%20Ohio">Lebanon</a>. It was built in the late 19th century to give the town of Lebanon and <a href="Warren%20County%2C%20Ohio">Warren County</a> better transportation facilities. The railroad was locally known as the "Highland Route", since it followed the ridge between the <a href="Little%20Miami%20River">Little</a> and <a href="Great%20Miami%20River">Great Miami</a> rivers, and was the only line not affected by floods such as the <a href="Great%20Dayton%20Flood">Great Dayton Flood</a> of 1913.

The line was completed in 1881, and the CL&N was formed in 1885. The company went through multiple <a href="bankruptcies">bankruptcies</a> until the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> gained control in 1896. CL&N continued its own operations until 1921, and existed until 1926, when the parent company merged CL&N and other smaller companies. Except for several years in the mid-1880s, when the line was under control of the <a href="Narrow%20gauge%20railway">narrow gauge</a> <a href="Toledo%2C%20Cincinnati%20and%20St.%20Louis%20Railroad">Toledo, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railroad</a>, it was not a major line, in part due to its steep approach to <a href="downtown%20Cincinnati">downtown Cincinnati</a>. For this reason, portions of the line have been abandoned, beginning in 1952 with a segment north of Lebanon.

Passenger service was eliminated entirely in 1934. <a href="Conrail">Conrail</a>, the Pennsylvania Railroad's successor, sold the remaining trackage in the 1980s to the <a href="Indiana%20and%20Ohio%20Railway">Indiana and Ohio Railway</a>, a <a href="short%20line%20railroad">short line</a> now owned by <a href="RailAmerica">RailAmerica</a>. That company continues to provide local freight service on the ex-CL&N, and the <a href="Lebanon%20Mason%20Monroe%20Railroad">Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad</a> operates <a href="tourist%20train">tourist train</a>s on a portion of the line near Lebanon.

The town of <a href="Lebanon%2C%20Ohio">Lebanon, Ohio</a>, laid out in 1802, was bypassed by the <a href="Miami%20and%20Erie%20Canal">Miami and Erie Canal</a> in 1830; the branch <a href="Warren%20County%20Canal">Warren County Canal</a> to Lebanon was wrecked by flooding in 1848. The <a href="Little%20Miami%20Railroad">Little Miami Railroad</a> (1846, later a <a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Pennsylvania</a> line) and <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Hamilton%20and%20Dayton%20Railroad">Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad</a> (1851, later a <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">B&O</a> line) followed the valleys of the <a href="Little%20Miami%20River">Little</a> and <a href="Great%20Miami%20River">Great Miami</a> rivers (the M&E Canal had used the latter), also bypassing the highlands on which Lebanon lay. Residents of the town obtained a legislative charter in March 1850 for the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Xenia Railroad (CL&X), which would extend from <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a> northeast through Lebanon to <a href="Xenia%2C%20Ohio">Xenia</a>. At the latter town, the incorporators decided the most likely connection would be the <a href="New%20York%20and%20Erie%20Railroad">New York and Erie Railroad</a>, which was planning on extending into Ohio. Thus the line was planned to use the Erie's <a href="broad%20gauge">broad gauge</a>.
To enter the city of Cincinnati, the CL&X would join the <a href="Dayton%20and%20Cincinnati%20Railroad">Dayton and Cincinnati Railroad</a> (D&C), which was planning the double-track <a href="Deer%20Creek%20Tunnel">Deer Creek Tunnel</a> through the <a href="Walnut%20Hills%2C%20Cincinnati">Walnut Hills</a>, at <a href="Sharonville%2C%20Ohio">Sharonville</a> (then known as Sharon). Tunnel construction began in late 1852, and the CL&X was finally organized under the charter in November. The CL&X located right-of-way, and began construction in about April 1853, but was forced to stop work by the end of 1855 due to lack of funds. Only grading between Sharon and Lebanon, mostly north of <a href="Mason%2C%20Ohio">Mason</a>, had been completed. (The tunnel project also failed, and was eventually acquired by the CL&N.) In July 1861, the courts appointed a <a href="Receiver%20%28legal%29">receiver</a> for the CL&X, who in March 1869 sold the unfinished railroad, which had cost $83,885, to 40 area residents for $4,000. Five trustees would ensure that the property was not sold without a majority of its owners consenting. Twenty years after its canal connection was destroyed, Lebanon was still without a modern connection to the outside world, and its economy continued to stagnate.

The 1870s fad of the <a href="narrow%20gauge%20railway">narrow gauge railway</a>, which was cheaper than broader gauges to build and operate (for low volumes of traffic), presented a new possibility. The <a href="Dayton%20and%20South%20Eastern%20Railroad">Dayton and South Eastern Railroad</a> (D&SE, later a <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">B&O</a> line) was planning a <a href="Narrow%20gauge%20railway">narrow gauge</a> line from the <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20OH">Jackson County</a> mines through Xenia to <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton</a>, and a branch from Xenia through Lebanon would connect to the markets at Cincinnati. The editors of the local newspaper, "<a href="The%20Western%20Star%20%28Ohio%29">The Western Star</a>", encouraged citizens to support the project, but by taking a more active role and organizing a locally owned railroad company to ensure its completion. Editorials likened the situation to <a href="Aesop%27s%20fable">Aesop's fable</a> of <a href="Hercules%20and%20the%20Carter">Hercules and the Carter</a>, where <a href="Hercules">Hercules</a> tells a stuck <a href="wikt%3Acarter">carter</a> that he will not assist unless the carter himself is willing to help. In November 1874, residents of Lebanon and the surrounding area organized the narrow gauge Miami Valley Narrow Gauge Railway (renamed Miami Valley Railway in October 1876), which would complete the unfinished CL&X as a branch of the D&SE.

Slow stock subscriptions delayed surveying until June 1875, when a line was located between Xenia and the <a href="Marietta%20and%20Cincinnati%20Railroad">Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad</a> (M&C, later a <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">B&O</a> line) west of <a href="Norwood%2C%20Ohio">Norwood</a>. Property owners in the villages of Norwood and <a href="Pleasant%20Ridge%2C%20Cincinnati">Pleasant Ridge</a>, wishing to develop their land as <a href="suburb">suburb</a>s, put forward a proposition to relocate the line to the east through their land in exchange for free right-of-way, and to build a <a href="steam%20dummy">steam dummy</a> line between Norwood and the <a href="horse%20car">horse car</a> lines in <a href="Walnut%20Hills%2C%20Cincinnati">Walnut Hills</a>, which would provide Miami Valley passengers with a more direct entrance to downtown Cincinnati than the circuitous M&C. However, in August, an even more direct route south of Norwood, through the rugged <a href="Deer%20Creek%20Valley">Deer Creek Valley</a>, was suggested, by which the Miami Valley could obtain its own access to Cincinnati. After imposing heavy restrictions, which would require the construction of several <a href="trestle">trestle</a>s and a tunnel, the Cincinnati City Council granted the right-of-way through the valley, including <a href="Eden%20Park%20%28Cincinnati%29">Eden Park</a>, to the railroad company. The owners of the old CL&X grade sold it in April 1876 for $8,000 in stock of the new company, and most of the land outside Cincinnati had been bought by that summer. The Miami Valley resolved in May 1876 to build only north to <a href="Waynesville%2C%20Ohio">Waynesville</a>, a village southwest of Xenia, where the projected <a href="Waynesville%2C%20Port%20William%20and%20Jeffersonville%20Railroad">Waynesville, Port William and Jeffersonville Railroad</a> and <a href="Jeffersonville%2C%20Mt.%20Sterling%20and%20Columbus%20Railroad">Jeffersonville, Mt. Sterling and Columbus Railroad</a> would extend to <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus</a>, crossing the D&SE at <a href="Octa%2C%20Ohio">Octa</a>. (The former completed most of its line, but abandoned it in 1887; the latter was only able to grade a portion.)

President <a href="Seth%20S.%20Haines">Seth S. Haines</a> of Waynesville <a href="groundbreaking">broke ground</a> in Eden Park on September 1, 1876, although most early work was done outside Cincinnati. The company continued to be plagued by lack of funds, and, despite completion of the grade between Norwood and Waynesville within a year, work soon slowed and eventually stopped in late 1878. Contractor John B. Benedict brought a <a href="lawsuit">suit</a> in December for <a href="breach%20of%20contract">breach of contract</a>, alleging that he was not properly paid. During the trial, two embarrassing facts came to light: Haines and Benedict had signed a "secret contract" giving Haines a portion of the bonds paid to Benedict, and the price of the line south of Norwood had been artificially inflated so that the connecting <a href="Cincinnati%20and%20Eastern%20Railway">Cincinnati and Eastern Railway</a> (C&E, later a <a href="Norfolk%20and%20Western%20Railway">N&W</a> line) would have to pay more for <a href="trackage%20rights">trackage rights</a> into Cincinnati. However, it was nonpayment of interest on bonds that forced the Miami Valley into receivership in January and <a href="foreclosure">foreclosure</a> in March 1880. Another decade had passed and Lebanon still lacked a railroad.

The <a href="Toledo%2C%20Delphos%20and%20Burlington%20Railroad">Toledo, Delphos and Burlington Railroad</a> (TD&B), a growing <a href="Narrow%20gauge%20railway">narrow gauge</a> system with roots in the town of <a href="Delphos%2C%20Ohio">Delphos</a>, would finally give Lebanon its rail line. Together with a group of suburban Cincinnati investors, the TD&B bought the unfinished grade at the foreclosure sale for $61,000 and incorporated the <a href="Narrow%20gauge%20railway">narrow gauge</a> Cincinnati Northern Railway as its successor on June 8, 1880. (The TD&B would also acquire the Dayton and South Eastern in February 1881.) At first the TD&B and Cincinnati-area residents shared stock and management equally, but soon this was changed so that the former party would control all the stock for ease in future consolidation, and the latter would locally manage the road. As the TD&B was in the process of building into Dayton from the north, it was decided that the new company would not use the grade all the way to Waynesville. Instead, the TD&B would construct a connection from the D&SE at a point they called Lebanon Junction, now inside Dayton near the intersection of Woodman and Rainier Drives, to the small village of <a href="Dodds%2C%20Ohio">Dodds</a>. There the Cincinnati Northern would begin, following the Miami Valley's route through Lebanon to Cincinnati. Construction resumed in late 1880, and proceeded rapidly thanks to funding from Ohio and <a href="Northeastern%20U.S.">Northeastern</a> capitalists. <a href="Mixed%20train">Mixed train</a> operations between Lebanon and Norwood, where connections could be made with the M&C, began on May 30, 1881, and on September 5 the line was opened south to a streetcar connection at Oak Street, just north of the tunnel. Service was extended through the tunnel to the Eden Park entrance on January 12, 1882, and on February 13 a temporary Cincinnati depot opened just north of Court Street. With the completion of the TD&B's branch from Lebanon Junction to Dodds in December 1881, the Cincinnati-Dayton line was finally complete; <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Ohio">Jackson County</a> coal was first shipped over it in February 1882. Two short branches to the suburbs of <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Ohio">Montgomery</a> and <a href="Avondale%2C%20Cincinnati">Avondale</a>—the latter built separately as the <a href="Spring%20Grove%2C%20Avondale%20and%20Cincinnati%20Railway">Spring Grove, Avondale and Cincinnati Railway</a> (SGA&C)—opened on November 14, 1881 and July 1, 1882, respectively. C&E operations to Court Street began by April 1882, using the Cincinnati Northern south of a junction at <a href="Idlewild%2C%20Ohio">Idlewild</a>, and in October the Cincinnati Northern laid tracks across that street into its permanent depot at the southeast corner of the Broadway Street intersection.
The TD&B absorbed its subsidiary, the <a href="Toledo%2C%20Cincinnati%20and%20St.%20Louis%20Railroad">Toledo, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railroad</a> (TC&StL), in March 1882, and took its name as more descriptive of the growing system, which hoped to become part of a nationwide narrow gauge network stretching southwest to <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>. One year later, in May 1883, the Cincinnati Northern and the SGA&C were consolidated into the TC&StL. However, the TC&StL was constructed cheaply, with poor drainage and little <a href="Track%20ballast">ballast</a>. While the Cincinnati Northern had been built to better standards, the connecting line between Lebanon Junction and Dodds was just as bad. The inadequate facilities and equipment, as well as difficulties in interchanging equipment with lines, contributed to its entering receivership in August 1883. The TC&StL had six divisions at this time. Four of the five TC&StL divisions south of Delphos were sold to their bondholders at auction in June 1884, and separate companies were soon organized for three of those: the <a href="Dayton%20and%20Toledo%20Railroad">Dayton and Toledo Railroad</a>, <a href="Dayton%20and%20Ironton%20Railroad">Dayton and Ironton Railroad</a>, and <a href="Iron%20Railway">Iron Railway</a> (named "<a href="Iron%20Railroad">Iron Railroad</a>" prior to TC&StL receivership). The Toledo-St. Louis line was sold in December 1885 and reorganized as the <a href="Toledo%2C%20St.%20Louis%20and%20Kansas%20City%20Railroad">Toledo, St. Louis and Kansas City Railroad</a>, commonly known as the Clover Leaf Route. In July, <a href="George%20Hafer">George Hafer</a> of Avondale replaced William J. Craig of Toledo as receiver of the Cincinnati Northern Division, allowing it to recover from Craig's <a href="deferred%20maintenance">deferred maintenance</a>. Hafer obtained a short-term lease from the trustees of the Dodds-Lebanon Junction line (officially the Cincinnati Division), allowing continued access to Dayton. Finally, on June 27, 1885, the Cincinnati Northern Division was sold for $200,000 to its bondholders, who incorporated the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway, with Hafer as president, on July 14 and transferred operations on August 1, 1885. The narrow gauge movement of the 1870s had failed, and all of the ex-TC&StL lines were converted to standard gauge within the next ten years.

The newly organized CL&N initially operated a main line from Court Street in Cincinnati to Dayton, leasing the track from Dodds to Lebanon Junction from the Cincinnati Division trustees, and <a href="trackage%20rights">trackage rights</a> over the <a href="Dayton%20and%20Ironton%20Railroad">Dayton and Ironton Railroad</a> (the old <a href="Narrow%20gauge%20railway">narrow gauge</a> D&SE line) into Dayton. But the latter was converted to in April 1887, and CL&N service was cut back to Dodds, since the operations north of there were unprofitable even when it was able to reach Dayton. (The line from Lebanon to Dodds was leased in 1892 to the company organized to operate north of Dodds.) <a href="Avondale%20Branch">Avondale Branch</a> operations were discontinued in August 1889, due to competition from the cheaper <a href="Mt.%20Auburn%20Cable%20Railway">Mt. Auburn Cable Railway</a>. Under Hafer's leadership, new passenger and freight depots opened on the north side of Court Street in December 1885. In preparation for conversion to standard gauge, the CL&N relaid rail and replaced bridges, including a straight <a href="trestle">trestle</a> in the Deer Creek Valley, completed in January 1889, in place of a curving old narrow gauge structure. The first standard gauge rails were laid by August 1889 as part of a <a href="dual%20gauge">dual gauge</a> setup south of Idlewild, when the <a href="Ohio%20and%20North%20Western%20Railroad">Ohio and North Western Railroad</a> (O&NW, successor to the C&E), which had converted its line to standard gauge, moved its trains from the <a href="Little%20Miami%20Railroad">Little Miami Railroad</a> (<a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> system) back to the CL&N. Several months later, a third rail was laid north to East Norwood, allowing the O&NW to connect with the <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Southwestern%20Railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern Railroad</a> (successor to the M&C). After undertaking more improvements to the alignment, the company completed the conversion of the main line to Lebanon to standard gauge on September 16, 1894, although, until it acquired a full set of standard gauge equipment, much of the commuter service to <a href="Blue%20Ash%2C%20Ohio">Blue Ash</a> continued to use the narrow gauge tracks.
Throughout the CL&N's independence, various larger companies were looking to acquire it, mainly for the valuable Court Street terminal property. The most persistent rumor was that the <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Jackson%20and%20Mackinaw%20Railroad">Cincinnati, Jackson and Mackinaw Railroad</a> (CJ&M, later a <a href="New%20York%20Central%20Railroad">NYC</a> line) would buy the CL&N as an entrance to Cincinnati. The CJ&M had built south from <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> to <a href="Carlisle%2C%20Ohio">Carlisle, Ohio</a> in 1887, and initially acquired <a href="trackage%20rights">trackage rights</a> over the CH&D to reach Cincinnati. Negotiations between the CL&N and CJ&M convinced the CH&D that the latter was capable of becoming a strong competitor, despite its poor financial state, and the CH&D attempted to acquire the CJ&M in 1892. But the CL&N stopped the consolidation based on Ohio's laws prohibiting such <a href="anti-competitive">anti-competitive</a> practices, and the CJ&M continued to look at the CL&N as a possible part of its line. After the CL&N's conversion to standard gauge was completed in 1894, the CJ&M secured trackage rights over the CL&N into Court Street, beginning service on January 27, 1896 via an extension from Carlisle to <a href="Franklin%2C%20Ohio">Franklin</a>, the <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Cincinnati%2C%20Chicago%20and%20St.%20Louis%20Railway">Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway</a> (Big Four, later a NYC line) to <a href="Middletown%2C%20Ohio">Middletown</a>, and the recently opened <a href="Middletown%20and%20Cincinnati%20Railroad">Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad</a> to the CL&N at <a href="Hageman%2C%20Ohio">Hageman</a>. The CJ&M also acquired the long-dormant <a href="Deer%20Creek%20Tunnel">Deer Creek Tunnel</a> project in an attempt to construct its own route into the city, tired of dealing with Hafer and the CL&N. The <a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a>, owner of the <a href="Little%20Miami%20Railroad">Little Miami Railroad</a> that had been constructed east of Lebanon in the 1840s, entered the negotiations in 1896 to protect its Cincinnati-area interests, and in March it (through the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Company">Pennsylvania Company</a>) acquired a majority of the CL&N's stock. Pennsylvania officials took over management in May, and in 1902 the CL&N acquired the tunnel property and some terminal property near Court Street from the <a href="Cincinnati%20Northern%20Railroad%20%281894-1938%29">Cincinnati Northern Railroad</a>, successor to the CJ&M, which had become part of the Big Four and terminated its use of the CL&N in 1901.

As a part of the Pennsylvania system, the CL&N continued to operate its own property (which included the line north of Dodds after 1914) until January 1, 1921, when it was leased to the Pennsylvania. Starting at the end of 1918, the <a href="Interstate%20Commerce%20Commission">Interstate Commerce Commission</a> classified the CL&N as a <a href="Class%20I%20railroad">Class I railroad</a>, meaning that it made at least $1 million per year in operating revenue. (This designation was dropped in 1921 when the CL&N was leased.) However, net operating income, revenue minus costs, which had steadily climbed from the 1890s, began falling in 1916, becoming a deficit in 1920. Subsequently, effective January 1, 1926, the Pennsylvania merged the CL&N with several other small companies—the <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Akron%20and%20Cincinnati%20Railway">Cleveland, Akron and Cincinnati Railway</a>, <a href="Manufacturers%20Railway%20%28Toledo%2C%20Ohio%29">Manufacturers Railway</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania-Detroit%20Railroad">Pennsylvania-Detroit Railroad</a>, and <a href="Toledo%2C%20Columbus%20and%20Ohio%20River%20Railroad">Toledo, Columbus and Ohio River Railroad</a>—to create the <a href="Pennsylvania%2C%20Ohio%20and%20Detroit%20Railroad">Pennsylvania, Ohio and Detroit Railroad</a>, a <a href="non-operating%20subsidiary">non-operating subsidiary</a>. That company was merged into the <a href="Connecting%20Railway">Connecting Railway</a>, previously a short link in <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20PA">Philadelphia</a>, in 1956, and its lessee merged with the <a href="New%20York%20Central%20Railroad">New York Central Railroad</a> in 1968 to form <a href="Penn%20Central%20Transportation">Penn Central Transportation</a>.

The line north of Dodds, built by the TD&B to connect the Cincinnati Northern to the D&SE at Lebanon Junction, was sold separately at the June 1884 foreclosure sale, to its first-mortgage bondholders for $20,000. Initially operated under lease by the CL&N, service was discontinued in April 1887 when the ex-D&SE was converted from narrow gauge to . With its northern connection gone, and no on-line sources of revenue, there was no profit in operating the line. However, one such source would soon be created, when local businessman Henry Lewis decided to purchase nearby "<a href="Dayton%20limestone">Dayton limestone</a>" <a href="quarries">quarries</a> at <a href="Centerville%2C%20Ohio">Centerville</a>. He bought the abandoned rail line from the bondholders' trustees for $40,000 in December 1888, and in January 1889 organized the Dayton, Lebanon and Cincinnati Railroad (DL&C). Extensions on both ends were planned, north into downtown Dayton and south to a standard gauge connection. Lewis finished converting the <a href="Narrow%20gauge%20railway">narrow gauge</a> line to standard gauge in January 1891, and initially leased it to the <a href="Dayton%2C%20Fort%20Wayne%20and%20Chicago%20Railway">Dayton, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway</a>, successor to the D&SE. He leased in 1890 and later bought land in Dayton for the proposed terminal, and in early 1892 he acquired the quarries at Centerville, giving the line its source of traffic. The DL&C bought the line from Lewis in March 1892 for $189,000 in stock, and in June it acquired a lease on the CL&N's line between Dodds and Lebanon. After converting the track to standard gauge, the DL&C began operations into Lebanon in late December 1892. However, it was unable to negotiate <a href="trackage%20rights">trackage rights</a> with the <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Dayton%20and%20Ironton%20Railroad">Cincinnati, Dayton and Ironton Railroad</a> (the latest name for the ex-D&SE), and only operated north to Lebanon Junction, where passengers could transfer to that company's trains into Dayton. Throughout its life, the DL&C competed with the CL&N wherever possible; for example, the CL&N advertised (along with the <a href="Middletown%20and%20Cincinnati%20Railroad">Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad</a> and Big Four) a faster route between Lebanon and Dayton via <a href="Hageman%2C%20Ohio">Hageman</a> and <a href="Middletown%2C%20Ohio">Middletown</a>.
Lewis died in 1893, and in the next decade the DL&C built no new lines. However, a group of investors bought the company, including the Dayton terminal property, in 1901 for $250,000 from Lewis's heirs. The first segment of the line into downtown Dayton was completed in late 1902, branching off the main line at <a href="Hempstead%2C%20Ohio">Hempstead</a> and ending at <a href="Lambeth%2C%20Ohio">Lambeth</a>, site of the <a href="Dayton%20State%20Hospital">Dayton State Hospital</a>. Unable to obtain a <a href="government-granted%20monopoly">franchise</a> from Dayton, and still unprofitable, the DL&C entered receivership in January 1905, and was sold at foreclosure in April 1907 and reorganized in May as the Dayton, Lebanon and Cincinnati Railroad and Terminal Company. The bondholders who had organized the new company succeeded in obtaining the franchise, and sold the stock to a new group of investors in January 1909. Construction was restarted in April, and in November the branch reached the intersection of Brown and Caldwell Streets and the <a href="National%20Cash%20Register">National Cash Register</a> plant. Finally, after completing the <a href="cuts%20and%20fills">cuts and fills</a> required along the east bank of the <a href="Great%20Miami%20River">Great Miami River</a>, the DL&C opened its new main line in 1912, to a passenger depot on the north side of Washington Street, several blocks south and west of the city's main <a href="Union%20Station%20%28Dayton%2C%20Ohio%29">Union Station</a>. A freight depot was located just to the north, at Eaker Street, and just beyond was an interchange track (not part of the original line) connecting to the <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Hamilton%20and%20Dayton%20Railway%20%281895%E2%80%931917%29">Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway</a> (<a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">B&O</a> system) and, via that line, the <a href="Pittsburgh%2C%20Cincinnati%2C%20Chicago%20and%20St.%20Louis%20Railway">Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway</a> (Panhandle Route, part of the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Pennsylvania</a> system).

The other line eventually acquired by the CL&N was the <a href="Middletown%20and%20Cincinnati%20Railway">Middletown and Cincinnati Railway</a> (M&C, not to be confused with the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad discussed earlier). <a href="Paul%20J.%20Sorg">Paul J. Sorg</a>, owner of a <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a> plant east of <a href="Middletown%2C%20OH">Middletown</a>, was unhappy with the service provided by the <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Hamilton%20and%20Dayton%20Railroad">Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad</a> (then independent) and <a href="Cincinnati%20and%20Springfield%20Railway">Cincinnati and Springfield Railway</a> (<a href="CCC%26amp%3BStL">Big Four</a> system), both of which bypassed the center of town. Sorg and associates incorporated the M&C in early 1890, and surveyed a line from Middletown, which lay in the <a href="Great%20Miami%20River">Great Miami River</a> valley, southeast to a point that would be known as <a href="Middletown%20Junction%2C%20Ohio">Middletown Junction</a> on the <a href="Little%20Miami%20Railroad">Little Miami Railroad</a> (Pennsylvania system). Construction on the majority of the route, which crossed the CL&N at <a href="Hageman%2C%20OH">Hageman</a>, was complete by September 1891, and a <a href="truss%20bridge">truss bridge</a> over the <a href="Little%20Miami%20River">Little Miami River</a> opened in early 1892, linking the line to the Pennsylvania. Access into central Middletown was delayed until December, when it was finally able to cross the CH&D to its depot. As opposed to the CL&N and DL&C, the M&C was straight and flat, giving a smooth ride, and turned a reasonable profit. The revenue was not enough, however, to pay off the bonds, and the M&C entered receivership in July 1894. The holders of liens against the property bought the line at foreclosure in October for $335,000, incorporated the Middletown and Cincinnati "Railroad" in December, and elected Sorg president.

Sorg died on May 28, 1902, and six days later the CL&N, owned by the Pennsylvania since 1896, bought its property for $400,000 and began operating it as a branch. The DL&C would be acquired twelve years later, after the <a href="Great%20Dayton%20Flood">Great Dayton Flood</a> of 1913. The CL&N and DL&C, built on the highlands between the river valleys, combined to provide the only access into Dayton during the disaster. The Pennsylvania realized that the DL&C would make a good acquisition in the event of future flooding, and had the CL&N buy and begin operating the DL&C for about $700,000 in December 1914. (Through service between Cincinnati and Dayton had begun that summer.) The DL&C built a short connection from Lebanon Junction to the Panhandle Route at <a href="Clement%2C%20Ohio">Clement</a> in early 1915, and on July 1 its property became that of the CL&N.

Competition from <a href="interurban">interurban</a>s, specifically the Cincinnati-Lebanon <a href="Interurban%20Railway%20and%20Terminal%20Company">Interurban Railway and Terminal Company</a>, took away passengers from the CL&N beginning in 1903. But the interurban began to decline, going out of business in 1922, and it was <a href="motor%20vehicle">motor vehicle</a>s that would kill the CL&N's passenger service. The first line to go was the Middletown Branch, discontinued in 1917; the short branch to Montgomery became freight-only in 1926. All service north of Lebanon ended in 1928, and in 1931 only one <a href="mixed%20train">mixed train</a> between Court Street and Lebanon was left on the schedule. The less-convenient <a href="Cincinnati%20Union%20Terminal">Cincinnati Union Terminal</a> replaced Court Street in 1933, as agreed upon by all railroads participating in its construction. CL&N trains reached the station via <a href="trackage%20rights">trackage rights</a> on the <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a> (ex-M&C) south of East Norwood. This was never popular among CL&N riders, and the last scheduled passenger train on the former CL&N ran on January 31, 1934. With passenger service gone, and several cross-connections to other Pennsylvania lines, the CL&N was no longer needed as a through route. Several years after the Montgomery Branch was fully abandoned in 1933, the Pennsylvania discontinued freight service between <a href="Blue%20Ash%2C%20Ohio">Blue Ash</a> and <a href="Mason%2C%20Ohio">Mason</a> and between Lebanon and <a href="Lytle%2C%20Ohio">Lytle</a>; trains continued to reach Lebanon via the <a href="Little%20Miami%20Railroad">Little Miami Railroad</a> and Middletown Branch. Service was resumed on the entire line during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, but the Lebanon-Lytle segment was torn up in 1952. After the Pennsylvania merged into Penn Central in 1968, a piece north from <a href="Brecon%2C%20Ohio">Brecon</a> was again abandoned, as was the short piece of the Middletown Branch east of the main line at <a href="Hageman%2C%20Ohio">Hageman</a>, with Lebanon service now coming from the ex-New York Central at Middletown. The line through the Deer Creek Valley into Court Street was also abandoned, and the old freight depot was torn down in 1975.

When the <a href="Consolidated%20Rail%20Corporation">Consolidated Rail Corporation</a> (Conrail) acquired the assets of the bankrupt Penn Central in 1976, it was allowed to choose which lines to keep and which to abandon. The line between <a href="Avondale%2C%20Cincinnati">Avondale</a> and Brecon still saw heavy freight traffic, and there would still be a reasonable amount of traffic to Mason and <a href="Hempstead%2C%20Ohio">Hempstead</a>. Thus Conrail bought about half of the ex-CL&N, including the main line from Cincinnati to Brecon (Blue Ash Secondary Track), Mason to Hageman (Mason Secondary Track), Hempstead to <a href="Pasadena%2C%20Ohio">Pasadena</a> (Kettering Running Track), and Patterson Road to Dayton (DP&L Industrial Track), as well as Middletown to Hageman (Middletown Secondary) and Hempstead to Clement (Clement Running Track). Ownership of the remaining lines—Brecon to Mason, Hageman to Lebanon, Lytle to Hempstead, Pasadena to Patterson Road, and Hageman to Middletown Junction—remained with the Penn Central trustees, although, with local funding, Conrail operated the two segments from Hageman to Lebanon and <a href="Centerville%2C%20OH">Centerville</a> to Hempstead as "<a href="light%20density%20line%20%28Conrail%29">light density line</a>s". Tracks between Lytle and Centerville were torn up in 1979. Since then, several more segments have been abandoned, including Avondale to <a href="McCullough%2C%20Ohio">McCullough</a> and Centerville to <a href="Kettering%2C%20OH">Kettering</a>. <a href="Short%20line%20railway">Short line</a> <a href="Indiana%20and%20Ohio%20Railway">Indiana and Ohio Railway</a> (IORY) acquired most of the remainder in the 1980s, beginning operations from <a href="Monroe%2C%20OH">Monroe</a> (near Middletown) to Mason and Lebanon in March 1985, and McCullough to Brecon in December 1986. The city of Lebanon has bought the Hageman-Lebanon segment, initially owned by the Penn Central trustees, and the <a href="Southwest%20Ohio%20Regional%20Transit%20Authority">Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority</a> acquired the property between McCullough and Brecon in 1997 for a proposed <a href="public%20transit">public transit</a> line. (IORY continues to operate freight on both of these segments.) The IORY began running <a href="tourist%20train">tourist train</a>s on the Lebanon segment in 1985. The passenger operations were split in 1996, going through several renamings to Turtle Creek Valley Railway, Turtle Creek and Lebanon Railway, and finally <a href="Lebanon%20Mason%20Monroe%20Railroad">Lebanon Mason Monroe Railroad</a>. Three short segments of line at Middletown and Dayton remained with Conrail until its 1999 breakup, when the <a href="Norfolk%20Southern%20Railway">Norfolk Southern Railway</a> acquired Conrail's assets in southwestern Ohio.

Lying on the highlands between the <a href="Little%20Miami%20River">Little</a> and <a href="Great%20Miami%20River">Great Miami River</a>s, the CL&N was commonly known as the "Highland Route". While it normally received only local traffic, its location was a distinct advantage during floods. This was first demonstrated during the <a href="Flood%20of%201884">Flood of 1884</a>, when the rising <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> cut off all other railroads from downtown Cincinnati. But the load was too much for the <a href="Narrow%20gauge%20railway">narrow gauge</a> TC&StL, and several companies switched to <a href="Miami%20and%20Erie%20Canal">Miami and Erie Canal</a> boats to make the connections until the waters subsided. Similar Cincinnati floods happened in 1883, 1897, 1898, 1907, and 1937, but in 1913 the <a href="Great%20Dayton%20Flood">Great Dayton Flood</a> inundated that city, then lying at the north end of the independent DL&C. That company had just completed its line into downtown Dayton, when, less than a year later, the <a href="Loramie%20Reservoir">Loramie Reservoir</a> broke through its levees and sent a swell of water through down the Great Miami River and into the city. As with the Cincinnati floods, only the CL&N and DL&C were unaffected, and relief supplies were sent north from Cincinnati via Lebanon to the <a href="National%20Cash%20Register">National Cash Register</a> plant.
The line began on the east side of downtown Cincinnati, at the corner of Eggleston Avenue and Court Street. The site of the brick freight depot, closed in 1969 and demolished in 1975, is now owned by <a href="Greyhound%20Lines">Greyhound Lines</a>, which uses it as an <a href="intercity%20bus">intercity bus</a> <a href="Bus%20station">terminal</a>. A track built in 1887 crossed Court Street, connecting with the <a href="Little%20Miami%20Railroad">Little Miami Railroad</a>'s <a href="Eggleston%20Avenue%20Connection">Eggleston Avenue Connection</a> for freight transfer. The line began by climbing the <a href="Deer%20Creek%20Valley">Deer Creek Valley</a>, the only feasible rail entrance to downtown Cincinnati that did not follow a river valley. When the railroad was built in the late 1870s, the valley was used by the city as a <a href="Landfill">dump</a>. An 1852 city ordinance provided for raising the ground level, beginning with the raising of Court Street by as much as . To follow the eventual surface level and avoid the steep hillsides, the railroad was built on <a href="trestle">trestle</a>s for much of its ascent, with a maximum <a href="grade%20%28slope%29">grade</a> of 3.5%. After leaving the depot, the line traversed an S-shaped trestle to the east side of the valley, before crossing Elsinore Place and Eden Park Drive <a href="at-grade%20crossing">at grade</a>, with a second trestle between these streets. (The former was replaced in January 1889 with a straighter single-track trestle.) A bridge took the line over Florence Avenue, and it then passed through the neighborhood of <a href="Mount%20Auburn%20Historic%20District">Mount Auburn</a> before passing under the summit through the <a href="cut-and-cover">cut-and-cover</a> <a href="Oak%20Street%20Tunnel">Oak Street Tunnel</a> north of McMillan Street. The line started its gradual descent as it left the tunnel, generally following the existing ground level and crossing streets at grade.
Double tracks initially stretched from Court Street to near Fredonia Avenue, where the <a href="Avondale%20Branch">Avondale Branch</a> split for the <a href="Cincinnati%20Zoo">Cincinnati Zoo</a>. When the line was converted to in 1894, the tunnel and McMillan Street underpass were not wide enough for a double-track line, yet two standard gauge tracks were laid side-by-side. After an accident in 1916, the tracks were relaid as a <a href="gauntlet%20track">gauntlet track</a>. The trestles were rebuilt as single-track in 1888 and 1889, after which double track only extended from Eden Park Drive to Avondale. Due to increased passenger traffic, the line was re-widened not only south to Court Street but also north to <a href="Norwood%2C%20Ohio">Norwood</a> from 1902 to 1904, once the valley had been filled in. Beyond <a href="Avondale%2C%20Cincinnati">Avondale</a>, the CL&N descended through <a href="Idlewild%2C%20Ohio">Idlewild</a>, where two <a href="Norfolk%20and%20Western%20Railway">Norfolk and Western Railway</a> lines diverged—the <a href="Cincinnati%20and%20Eastern%20Railway">Cincinnati and Eastern Railway</a> east to <a href="Portsmouth%2C%20Ohio">Portsmouth</a> and the <a href="Cincinnati%20Connecting%20Belt%20Railroad">Cincinnati Connecting Belt Railroad</a> northwest to a junction near <a href="Elmwood%20Place%2C%20Ohio">Elmwood Place</a>. The railway began to climb again at <a href="East%20Norwood%2C%20Ohio">East Norwood</a>, where it crossed the <a href="Marietta%20and%20Cincinnati%20Railroad">Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad</a> (<a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a>), reaching the flat highlands at <a href="Deer%20Park%2C%20Ohio">Deer Park</a>. In the late 1880s, the CL&N, with its frequent <a href="commuter%20rail">commuter service</a>, contributed to the development of <a href="suburb">suburb</a>s along its line including Idlewild, East Norwood, <a href="Silverton%2C%20Ohio">Silverton</a>, Deer Park, and <a href="Hazelwood%2C%20Ohio">Hazelwood</a>. At Hopkins Avenue in Norwood, commuters unsatisfied with the bare platform built by the railroad company raised $1500 to build a station building, which opened on August 1, 1888, and was owned by the Hopkins Avenue Depot Company until service ended in the 1930s. It was later used as a <a href="gas%20station">gas station</a>, and now houses a <a href="chiropractor">chiropractor</a>. As part of its <a href="U.S.%20bicentennial">bicentennial</a> celebration, the city of Silverton built a replica of its former CL&N station with a museum inside.

Just beyond East Norwood, the Pennsylvania built <a href="McCullough%20Yard">McCullough Yard</a> in 1927, improving switching operations for the growing industrial base in Norwood. A connection was included to the Pennsylvania's <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>-bound <a href="Richmond%20Branch">Richmond Branch</a>, which the CL&N crossed over north of the yard. In <a href="Butler%20County%2C%20Ohio">Butler County</a>, north of <a href="Brecon%2C%20Ohio">Brecon</a>, the CL&N curved abruptly northeast onto the original line, partially graded in the 1850s between <a href="Sharonville%2C%20Ohio">Sharonville</a> and Lebanon. Just beyond, it began to descend slowly through <a href="Mason%2C%20Ohio">Mason</a> to <a href="Hageman%2C%20Ohio">Hageman</a>, where it crossed the <a href="Middletown%20Branch">Middletown Branch</a>, and then rose slightly, alongside <a href="Turtle%20Creek%20%28Little%20Miami%20River%29">Turtle Creek</a>, to Lebanon. The Pennsylvania tore down the original Lebanon passenger station in 1960, replacing it (for freight purposes) with a smaller building from <a href="Kings%20Mills%2C%20Ohio">Kings Mills</a> on the <a href="Little%20Miami%20Railroad">Little Miami Railroad</a>. The Lebanon Council of Garden Clubs acquired the land in 1972, tore down the freight depot, and erected a replica of the old passenger depot in its place, with a <a href="gift%20shop">gift shop</a> inside.

Leaving Lebanon, the line ascended a small gully and then headed north-northeasterly across the highlands to <a href="Dodds%2C%20Ohio">Dodds</a>. The never-used grade from Dodds to <a href="Waynesville%2C%20Ohio">Waynesville</a> descended into the <a href="Little%20Miami%20River">Little Miami River</a> valley via <a href="Newman%20Run">Newman Run</a> before turning north and ending at the latter village. Portions of the right-of-way and stone <a href="abutment">abutment</a>s for several never-built bridges remain on what is now farmland. The line as completed turned north at Dodds, and required several <a href="cuts%20and%20fills">cuts and fills</a> to traverse the rolling terrain. At <a href="Hempstead%2C%20Ohio">Hempstead</a>, just north of Hempstead Road, the line split. The original route continued north, parallel to Woodman Drive, to the old <a href="Dayton%20and%20South%20Eastern%20Railroad">Dayton and South Eastern Railroad</a> (now the <a href="Iron%20Horse%20Trail%20%28Ohio%29">Iron Horse Trail</a>) at Lebanon Junction. A 1915 extension was built parallel to the ex-D&SE, and ended at the <a href="Panhandle%20Route">Panhandle Route</a> (now the <a href="Creekside%20Trail">Creekside Trail</a> to the east) at <a href="Clement%2C%20Ohio">Clement</a>. Part of this line is still operated by the <a href="Norfolk%20Southern%20Railway">Norfolk Southern Railway</a>, and to the south the right-of-way is being used for an extension of the Iron Horse Trail. The other branch headed northwesterly into downtown Dayton, steadily descending as it passed south of the <a href="University%20of%20Dayton">University of Dayton</a> and alongside the <a href="Great%20Miami%20River">Great Miami River</a>. The main passenger and freight depots were at Washington Street, which the CL&N passed over on the first such <a href="grade%20separation">grade separation</a> in Dayton. The first freight depot opened with the line in 1912, and was replaced in 1930 by a larger structure, itself torn down in 1966.

<a href="Joseph%20Wood%20%28Pennsylvania%20Railroad%29">Joseph Wood</a> was the first of at least two Pennsylvania Railroad men elected president after that company gained control in 1896.

When the CL&N converted to in 1894, it initially mounted its <a href="Narrow%20gauge%20railway">narrow gauge</a> <a href="passenger%20car%20%28rail%29">passenger cars</a> on standard gauge trucks. These were replaced with standard gauge cars after the Pennsylvania acquisition in 1896.

The first <a href="locomotive">locomotive</a> on the line, a <a href="Baldwin%20Locomotive%20Works">Baldwin</a> <a href="4-4-0">4-4-0</a> named "Warren County No. 1", was bought in 1877 by the Miami Valley Railway. In all, the CL&N and predecessors had nine narrow gauge locomotives, bought from four different manufacturers. Two were disposed of in the 1880s, and, of the seven remaining into the 1890s, six provided main line service and one was used as a <a href="switching%20%28railroad%29">switching</a> and <a href="helper%20locomotive">helper locomotive</a>.
Standard gauge operations began in 1894 with five locomotives, and the narrow gauge equipment was kept temporarily for commuter runs to <a href="Blue%20Ash%2C%20OH">Blue Ash</a>. Later acquisitions, as well as consolidations with other companies, raised the number to 23 in 1920, its final year of independent operation.

John Wark

John Wark (born 4 August 1957) is a Scottish former <a href="association%20football">footballer</a> who spent most of his playing time with <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>. He won a record four <a href="List%20of%20Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20Players%20of%20the%20Year">Player of the Year</a> awards before becoming one of the four inaugural members of the club's <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a>. Wark had long spells at the club, which bookended his career, and a third, brief interlude dividing his briefer periods at <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> and <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a>. A versatile player, Wark played most of his professional games as a <a href="midfielder">midfielder</a>, although he sometimes played as a <a href="Defender%20%28association%20football%29%23Centre-back">central defender</a> and on occasion as a <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29%23Striker">striker</a>.

Born in <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, Wark represented <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team">Scotland</a> in international football, winning 29 caps and scoring seven goals. This included selection for Scotland in the <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1982 FIFA World Cup</a> in which he made three appearances and scored twice.

During his playing career, Wark appeared in the film "<a href="Escape%20to%20Victory">Escape to Victory</a>". Since retiring as a professional player in 1996, he has continued to work for Ipswich Town—since September 2008 in the corporate hospitality department. His autobiography, "Wark On", was published in 2009.

Wark was born on 4 August 1957, in <a href="Princess%20Royal%20Maternity%20Hospital">Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital</a> to parents Alex and Helen. The third of four children, he has an older sister Wilma, older brother Alex and younger brother Andrew. The family lived in a four-storey <a href="Apartment%20building%23Scotland">tenement block</a> in <a href="Partick">Partick</a>. The family was impoverished: Wark's parents could not afford a cot and as a small child, he slept in a drawer from a <a href="sideboard">sideboard</a>. Although <a href="Infant%20baptism">christened</a> John, Wark was soon referred to by his family as Johnny, a diminutive that stuck throughout his footballing career.

In the early 1960s, the family moved to another tenement block, this time in <a href="Scotstoun">Scotstoun</a>, and Wark's father secured employment at nearby <a href="Albion%20Motors">Albion Motors</a>. The new home accommodated a back yard in which Wark played football from the age of six. He said "[f]ootball seemed to occupy 99 per cent of my time as a youngster" as he tried to emulate his brother Alex, who had become a professional at <a href="St%20Mirren%20F.C.">St Mirren</a>. Wark attended <a href="Scotstoun%20Primary%20School">Scotstoun Primary School</a>, where he became captain of the football team. On moving to secondary school, he was selected for the Glasgow Schools representative team. He also played for <a href="Drumchapel%20Amateur%20F.C.">Drumchapel Amateurs</a> at the under-14 level, where he was, for a period, managed by <a href="David%20Moyes">David Moyes</a>' father, also named David.

During Wark's time at Drumchapel, he attracted the attention of <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a>. He trained with the club at their <a href="Celtic%20Park">Parkhead</a> ground, before receiving an invitation to sign schoolboy forms for the club. As a lifelong <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> fan with whom Celtic have a <a href="Old%20Firm">notable rivalry</a> and with interest from "several English clubs", including <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a>, <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> and <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>, Wark stalled on the offer. He trialled with both Ipswich Town and Manchester City, and selected Ipswich when the latter remained non-committal. On arrival at <a href="Portman%20Road">Portman Road</a>, Town manager <a href="Bobby%20Robson">Bobby Robson</a>, later described by Wark as the person in football "who had the single biggest influence on [him]", personally welcomed him and Wark signed with the club as an apprentice.

Wark started his career at Ipswich in the youth team, initially playing at <a href="left%20back">left back</a> before moving to the centre of defence and occasionally occupying the <a href="right%20back">right back</a> position. He signed up as a professional for the club on his 17th birthday. Selected for the senior squad as a replacement for the injured <a href="Kevin%20Beattie">Kevin Beattie</a>, Wark made his first-team debut on 27 March 1975 in the 3–2 <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> 6th round (3rd replay) victory over <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>; the game was played at <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City's</a> <a href="Filbert%20Street">Filbert Street</a>. A nervous and homesick Wark was reassured by manager Robson:
"My debut was in the quarter-final of the FA Cup against the Leeds team of <a href="Johnny%20Giles">Giles</a> and <a href="Billy%20Bremner">Bremner</a>. He [Robson] said, 'I wouldn't put you in the team if I didn't think you were good enough'. He was a father figure as well because I was homesick. If it hadn't been for the boss I would have been straight back to Glasgow."
Making four more first-team appearances in place of injured regulars, Wark ended the season still on the youth team, and experienced success in the final of the <a href="FA%20Youth%20Cup">FA Youth Cup</a>, defeating <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> 5–1. He spent much of the 1975–76 season playing for the reserves, and was presented with the club's Young Player of the Year award, despite making just four appearances for the senior team. Moving into <a href="midfield">midfield</a>, Wark made over 30 appearances in the 1976–77 season, scoring his first goals for the club, (10, in all) taking over <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty kick</a>ing duty; he also received his first <a href="Red%20card%20%28sports%29">red card</a>.

In the June 1977, Wark was selected for <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team">the Scotland squad</a> for the first time, for a friendly match against <a href="East%20Germany%20national%20football%20team">East Germany</a>; however, a torn hamstring sustained in <a href="Preseason">pre-season training</a> ended any chance of an international debut. The injury also kept him out of first-team football until January 1978, when he returned for a match against <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> in the third round of the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20FA%20Cup">1977–78 FA Cup</a>.
Indifferent league performances that season meant that Ipswich finished just three points above the <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegation zone</a>, but the season ended in <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20FA%20Cup">success in the FA Cup</a>. Wark scored in a 3–1 victory over <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> in the semi-final, and appeared in the <a href="1978%20FA%20Cup%20Final">final</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a> as part of a side that surprised favourites <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>, winning the game 1–0. Wark remarked, "We were underdogs but on the day we hammered them." Wark did not touch the ball for the first 18 minutes of the match, and as the players left the pitch at half-time, <a href="David%20Geddis">David Geddis</a> said to Wark, "Make sure you hit it between the <a href="goalpost">posts</a> in the second-half. Avoid the white bits." In the second half of the game, Wark "ignored Geddis' advice and hit <a href="Pat%20Jennings">Pat Jennings</a>' right post twice with almost identical swerving right-foot shots from outside the penalty area".

Twice in the three seasons that followed, Ipswich came within one game of winning the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">League championship</a>, but finished as runners-up to Liverpool and <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, respectively. However, Ipswich did win the club's only <a href="UEFA">European trophy</a> when they lifted the <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20UEFA%20Cup">1980–81 UEFA Cup</a>. Wark set a competition record by scoring 14 goals—including two, one in each leg—in the <a href="1981%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">final</a> as Ipswich overcame Dutch side <a href="AZ%20Alkmaar">AZ 67 Alkmaar</a> 5–4 on <a href="Aggregate%20score">aggregate</a>. Wark's record equalled the long-standing scoring record in a European competition, set by <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Altafini">José Altafini</a> of <a href="A.C.%20Milan">A.C. Milan</a> in the <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20European%20Cup">1962–63 European Cup</a>. Wark's personal triumph that year was to win a European accolade, Young Player of the Year, and gain the acclaim of his fellow professionals in England to earn the <a href="PFA%20Players%27%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">PFA Player of the Year</a> award. He ended the 1980–81 season with 36 goals.

Wark continued to play for Ipswich, but after Robson left to become <a href="England%20national%20football%20team%20manager">England manager</a> in 1982, the side was gradually broken up by new manager <a href="Bobby%20Ferguson%20%28footballer%20born%201938%29">Bobby Ferguson</a>. Following a rejected demand for a wage increase, Wark submitted a <a href="transfer%20request">transfer request</a>, which was accepted. He signed for <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> for £450,000 on 10 March 1984. At the time, Liverpool had won the league title six times, the European Cup three times and the League Cup three times in the preceding eight seasons.

Wark's final full season at <a href="Portman%20Road">Portman Road</a>, <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20in%20English%20football">1982–83</a>, had seen him record the highest league goals tally of his career. He scored 20 goals in 42 league games, though it was not enough to prevent Ipswich from slipping to ninth place in the final table – their lowest position since finishing 18th in 1978.

The <a href="Transfer%20%28football%29%23Medical%20examination">medical examination</a> for Wark's transfer somewhat surprised him:

"I was rather taken aback when the doctor entered the Anfield <a href="The%20Boot%20Room">boot room</a>", Wark said. "He was small in stature and I could not help but detect the smell of alcohol on his breath as he introduced himself to me. I was even more surprised when he announced we would stay put to conduct the medical examination. "He took my <a href="blood%20pressure">blood pressure</a>, looked at the reading and muttered 'that's fine'. Then something happened that to this day I still cannot get over. He asked me to bend down and touch my toes. "Trying not to show my surprise, I did exactly as he asked and as I lifted my head he spoke again, this time to announce 'you've passed'. That was it, my Liverpool medical."

Wark made his debut for the club on 31 March 1984 in a 2–0 league win against <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a> at <a href="Vicarage%20Road">Vicarage Road</a>, and scored Liverpool's opening goal in the 58th minute. Liverpool won the English league title <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20in%20English%20football">that season</a>, and Wark made sufficient appearances to earn himself a medal. His unusual ability as a goalscoring midfielder was on display when he finished the <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20in%20English%20football">1984–85 season</a> as the club's top goalscorer, ahead of prolific striker <a href="Ian%20Rush">Ian Rush</a>, with a tally of 27 goals in 62 appearances—a goal every 2.3 games. Wark's season included three <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a>s, one each in the League, the FA Cup and the European Cup. Liverpool qualified for the <a href="1985%20European%20Cup%20Final">1985 European Cup Final</a> but the match was overshadowed by the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20Disaster">Heysel Stadium Disaster</a>, a tragedy Wark remembers as "a nightmare memory".

In the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20in%20English%20football">1985–86</a> season, Wark made 18 appearances, scoring six times, but missed out on the club's run-in to their League and FA Cup "<a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29%23England">double</a>", due to a broken ankle suffered just after the turn of 1986, followed by an <a href="Achilles%20tendon">Achilles tendon</a> injury. He eventually regained his fitness but struggled to regain his place in the Liverpool team until injury to <a href="Steve%20McMahon%20%28footballer%29">Steve McMahon</a> allowed him back in. Wark came on as a late substitute (but according to him, never touched the ball) when Liverpool lost the <a href="1987%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1987 League Cup Final</a> to Arsenal. No longer a part of manager <a href="Kenny%20Dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a>'s plans following the arrival of new midfielders including <a href="John%20Barnes%20%28footballer%29">John Barnes</a>, Wark was sold back to Ipswich on 4 January 1988 for £100,000. In spite of more financially lucrative offers from both <a href="Watford%20F.C">Watford</a> and <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry City</a>, he followed Bobby Robson's advice: "Money isn't everything—go where you will be happiest." Wark left the <a href="Merseyside">Merseyside</a> club with a record of 42 goals in 108 appearances, a goal every 2.6 games.

Ipswich had been relegated 18 months before Wark's return to the club and were still playing in the <a href="Football%20League%20Division%20Two">second tier of English football</a>. During this second spell at Ipswich, Wark was close to being an ever-present in the side: he missed just two games in two seasons. He was the club's equal top-scorer in the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">1988–89 season</a>, sharing the achievement with <a href="Striker%20%28football%29">forwards</a> <a href="Dalian%20Atkinson">Dalian Atkinson</a> and <a href="Jason%20Dozzell">Jason Dozzell</a>.

Following three seasons of mid-table finishes, manager <a href="John%20Duncan%20%28footballer%29">John Duncan</a> was sacked and replaced by <a href="John%20Lyall">John Lyall</a>. With his contract expiring, Wark received what he considered to be a "derisory" offer from Lyall, which he declined. Once he became a <a href="free%20agent">free agent</a>, Wark signed on a <a href="free%20transfer%20%28football%29">free transfer</a> for Second Division rivals <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> in August 1990. In his two additional seasons with Ipswich, Wark had scored 20 goals, and won the club's <a href="List%20of%20Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20Players%20of%20the%20Year">Player of the Year award</a> in both seasons.

Wark signed for Middlesbrough, the first club to show "a definite interest" in him, on a two-year contract, moving back to play in the centre of defence. He made regular appearances and helped the team to seventh place by the end of the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20in%20English%20football">season</a> and qualification for the <a href="Football%20League%20One%20play-offs">Second Division play-offs</a>. Following a 1–1 draw with <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a> at <a href="Ayresome%20Park">Ayresome Park</a>, Wark was informed by manager <a href="Colin%20Todd">Colin Todd</a> that he would not be selected for the second leg. Wark was outraged; Middlesbrough lost the second leg 1–0. Todd departed from the club and was replaced by <a href="Lennie%20Lawrence">Lennie Lawrence</a>, who insisted that all players live "within an hour of Ayresome Park". Wark was still living in Ipswich at the time and following a "sensible agreement" with Lawrence, Wark's contract was terminated and he became a free agent again.

Remaining without a club before the start of the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20in%20English%20football">1991–92 season</a>, Wark trained with Ipswich to keep fit, and rejected interest in his services from <a href="Leyton%20Orient%20F.C.">Leyton Orient</a>, <a href="Colchester%20United%20F.C.">Colchester United</a> and <a href="Falkirk%20F.C.">Falkirk</a>. When Ipswich suffered a succession of injuries among their defenders, they offered him a contract, initially on a week-by-week basis, before securing a year-long deal. Wark made 43 appearances in the first season of his third spell with the club. Early results in the season were excellent; the club won seven of their first 11 matches in the league. In the FA Cup, Ipswich progressed to a fifth round encounter against Liverpool; when the tie went to a replay at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a>, Wark received a standing ovation from both sets of fans. Ipswich lost the match 3–2 after extra time, having led 2–1 in the first period. Ipswich went on to finish strongly in their league campaign and were crowned Second Division champions and promoted into the newly formed <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>. Wark ended the season as the club's Player of the Year for the third time.

Wark agreed to a new one-year contract for the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20in%20English%20football">1992–93 season</a> and was asked to feature in a <a href="Sky%20Sports">Sky Sports</a> advertisement to promote the inaugural Premier League competition. Ipswich were the only Premier League club to remain unbeaten after eight games (a sequence that included Wark's first Premier League goal in a 1–1 draw with <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>). Ipswich went fourth in February and there was talk of finally winning that title that had eluded them more than once during Wark's first spell there, but 13 consecutive games without a win resulted a 16th-place finish in the table, just three points above the relegation zone, and only a win on the final day of the season made sure of their survival. Wark, now aged 37, secured yet another one-year contract shortly before the end of the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20in%20English%20football">1993–94 season</a>. Ipswich were saved from relegation in the last round of matches (for the second season running, another good start had given way to a late season slump), courtesy of an <a href="injury%20time">injury time</a> winning goal scored by <a href="Mark%20Stein%20%28footballer%29">Mark Stein</a> of <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> at <a href="Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29">Stamford Bridge</a>, which ensured that Ipswich's fellow strugglers <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> went down. Wark went on to be voted the club's Player of the Year for a record fourth time.

Ipswich and Wark fared worse in the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20in%20English%20football">1994–95 season</a>. The club lost 9–0 to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> during a season in which Ipswich "recorded fewer victories and suffered more defeats than in any campaign in the club's history". He was sent off in the away game at Norwich, where the team lost 3–0. Wark made fewer than 20 appearances in the following season, primarily because of a persistent foot injury. Despite his appearance in three more matches in the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20in%20English%20football">1996–97 season</a>, and a <a href="Testimonial%20match">testimonial</a> against <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> at Portman Road, Wark played his last professional match against <a href="Tranmere%20Rovers%20F.C.">Tranmere Rovers</a> on 30 November 1996 at the age of 39. By this stage, he was the club's oldest player. Of a total 826 league matches played by Wark as a professional, he made 679 appearances for Ipswich. , he is Ipswich Town's third-highest all-time scorer, with 179 goals scored for the club, despite rarely appearing as a striker.

From 1979, Wark was selected to play for his country, usually as a defender, eventually winning 29 caps for <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team">Scotland</a> and scoring seven goals. <a href="Jock%20Stein">Jock Stein</a> was the Scotland manager who gave him his debut, in a game held on 19 May 1979, a <a href="1979%20British%20Home%20Championship">British Home Championship</a> match against <a href="Wales%20national%20football%20team">Wales</a> at <a href="Ninian%20Park">Ninian Park</a>; Scotland lost 3–0. Wark scored his first international goal a week later on 26 May, again in a British Home Championship game, this time against <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a>. Wark's opening effort was not enough, as Scotland were defeated 3–1. A week later Wark played for Scotland in a friendly against <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentina</a> at <a href="Hampden%20Park">Hampden Park</a>. However, the game is best remembered for the performance of <a href="Diego%20Maradona">Diego Maradona</a> who scored his first international goal and whose performance led Argentina to a comfortable 3–1 win over the Scots.

After a 3–1 home defeat by <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team">Belgium</a> in December 1979, Wark was not selected again for his country until February 1981 for the <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1982 World Cup</a> qualifying match away against <a href="Israel%20national%20football%20team">Israel</a>. Following a successful qualification campaign, Wark was included in the Scotland squad that went to the World Cup in Spain under Stein's leadership. Wark played three games and scored two goals, both of which were Scotland's opening match against <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20football%20team">New Zealand</a>, a game Scotland won 5–2. Scotland were knocked out in the group stage.

Wark's final appearance for Scotland came in September 1984, under Stein; he was replaced in favour of <a href="Paul%20McStay">Paul McStay</a> at half-time in a 6–1 victory over <a href="Yugoslavia%20national%20football%20team">Yugoslavia</a>.

Wark has married twice—first to Toula, on 1 July 1981, with whom he has a son, Andrew, born in June 1983. He married Karen at <a href="Gretna%20Green">Gretna Green</a> in April 2009. They live in <a href="Onehouse">Onehouse</a> near <a href="Stowmarket">Stowmarket</a> in Suffolk.

In 1981, Wark was one of several Ipswich players who appeared alongside stars including <a href="Bobby%20Moore">Bobby Moore</a> and <a href="Pel%C3%A9">Pelé</a> in the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> football film "<a href="Escape%20to%20Victory">Escape to Victory</a>", which starred <a href="Sylvester%20Stallone">Sylvester Stallone</a>, <a href="Michael%20Caine">Michael Caine</a> and <a href="Max%20von%20Sydow">Max von Sydow</a>. Wark played a character called Arthur Hayes, but his only line was dubbed due to his broad Glaswegian accent.

Following his retirement from playing football professionally, Wark continued to live in Suffolk, like many other ex-Ipswich players, including <a href="Allan%20Hunter%20%28footballer%29">Allan Hunter</a>, <a href="Mick%20Mills">Mick Mills</a>, <a href="Roger%20Osborne">Roger Osborne</a> and <a href="Mick%20Lambert">Mick Lambert</a>. Despite his retirement from the professional ranks, Wark continued playing football as an amateur, and signed for <a href="Woodbridge%20Town%20F.C.">Woodbridge Town</a> in 1999 alongside former Ipswich team-mate <a href="Paul%20Mason%20%28footballer%29">Paul Mason</a>. He also played veterans football for Windsor and Eton, played with <a href="Soccer%20AM">Soccer AM</a>'s "Badgers" team at the <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a>, and has represented the Liverpool veterans in the Sky Sports <a href="Masters%20Football">Masters</a> series.

In 2005, Wark was voted as the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> television programme <a href="Football%20Focus">Football Focus</a> "all-time cult hero" by Ipswich Town fans. In 2008 <a href="Radio%20Suffolk">Radio Suffolk</a> announced that he would join their commentary team as a summariser, alongside former team-mates <a href="Kevin%20Beattie">Kevin Beattie</a> and <a href="Bryan%20Hamilton">Bryan Hamilton</a>. Wark was working in the corporate hospitality department at Ipswich Town in September 2008. As of March 2014, he remains in that job.

Wark's autobiography "Wark On" was published on 9 April 2009. The book contained material that gained media interest. Wark stated that he made "a small fortune by <a href="sales">flogging</a> tickets for the FA Cup Final to a <a href="black%20market">shady underworld ticket tout</a>". "Wark used his share of the cash to help pay for his wedding while a team-mate bankrolled a house extension. He added: "Other teams had done it, so why shouldn’t we? Nowadays it's illegal but in those days it was regarded as a perk." The report also highlighted Wark's "dig" at the current "crop of stars" at Anfield. He said: "None of that lot would have been good enough in my time at Anfield."

Wark played as a central defender, midfielder and, occasionally, as a striker. Wark was an unusual player; he was able to play as a defensive midfielder yet break forward to score. According to former team-mate <a href="Terry%20Butcher">Terry Butcher</a>, this was because his colleagues would drop back to cover for him: "I played with John Wark, who was a sitting midfielder but was one of the top scorers in England and Europe. If you see it, then do it, as long as the others spot it and cover for you."

Wark was not a "supremely talented" player, but, according to football journalist <a href="Jim%20White%20%28journalist%29">Jim White</a>, one who espoused team-work and team spirit: "There is no question that the 'one-for-all, all-for-one' mentality generated in the Anfield dressing room was the engine that drove the great team. With players such as <a href="Alan%20Kennedy">Alan Kennedy</a>, John Wark, <a href="Sammy%20Lee%20%28footballer%29">Sammy Lee</a> and <a href="Craig%20Johnston">Craig Johnston</a>, nobody could claim this was a collection of top-notch operators in the manner, say, of the current <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>. Every week, they played as an entity greater than the sum of its parts." He has been described as "a defensive midfielder with an astonishing goalscoring record".

Over the years, Wark has become closely associated with his moustache. <a href="Owen%20Slot">Owen Slot</a> described the player as "Ipswich's immortal moustache", while Wark himself notes "... it is something of a trademark, even if people are always calling me <a href="Bruce%20Grobbelaar">Bruce</a> ..."

In 2006 Wark gained the final place in the poll <a href="100%20Players%20Who%20Shook%20the%20Kop">100 Players Who Shook the Kop</a>, conducted by the liverpoolfc.tv website. The list was compiled as a result of a fan survey: "Over 110,000 supporters all nominated their own personal Top 10 players in order of impact made".
In 2007, the <a href="Professional%20Footballers%27%20Association">Professional Footballers' Association</a> polled fans of all Football League clubs, as to "their No 1 player" as part of the "centenary celebrations of the players' union"; Wark was the choice of Ipswich fans. In the same year, Wark was one of four Ipswich Town players to be inducted into the club's Hall of Fame.

Battle of Khafji

The Battle of Khafji was the first major ground engagement of the <a href="Gulf%20War">Persian Gulf War</a>. It took place in and around the Saudi Arabian city of <a href="Khafji">Khafji</a>, from 29 January to 1 February 1991 and marked the culmination of the <a href="Coalition%20of%20the%20Gulf%20War">Coalition</a>'s <a href="Gulf%20War%20air%20campaign">air campaign</a> over <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> and <a href="Ba%27athist%20Iraq">Iraq</a>, which had begun on 17 January 1991.

Iraqi leader <a href="Saddam%20Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, who had already tried and failed to draw Coalition troops into costly ground engagements by shelling Saudi Arabian positions and oil storage tanks and firing <a href="Scud">Scud</a> surface-to-surface missiles at <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, ordered the invasion of Saudi Arabia from southern Kuwait. The <a href="1st%20Division%20%28Iraq%29">1st</a> and <a href="5th%20Division%20%28Iraq%29">5th Mechanized Division</a>s and <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28Iraq%29">3rd Armored Division</a> were ordered to conduct a multi-pronged invasion toward Khafji, engaging Saudi Arabian, <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>i, and U.S. forces along the coastline.

These three divisions, which had been heavily damaged by Coalition aircraft in the preceding days, attacked on 29 January. Most of their attacks were repulsed by <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">U.S. Marines</a> as well as <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Rangers">U.S. Army Rangers</a> and Coalition aircraft, but one of the Iraqi columns occupied Khafji on the night of 29–30 January. Between 30 January and 1 February, two <a href="Saudi%20Arabian%20National%20Guard">Saudi Arabian National Guard</a> battalions and two Kuwaiti tank companies attempted to retake control of the city, aided by Coalition aircraft and U.S. artillery. By 1 February, the city had been recaptured at the cost of 43 Coalition servicemen dead and 52 wounded. Iraqi Army fatalities numbered between 60 and 300, while an estimated 400 were captured as <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a>.

Although the invasion of Khafji was initially a propaganda victory for the <a href="Ba%27ath%20Party%20%28Iraq%29">Ba'athist</a> <a href="Ba%27athist%20Iraq">Iraq</a>i regime, it was swiftly recaptured by Saudi Arabian ground forces. The battle serves as a modern demonstration that air power in a supporting role to ground forces can be of great assistance in halting and defeating a major ground operation.

On 2 August 1990, the <a href="Iraqi%20Army">Iraqi Army</a> invaded and occupied the neighboring state of <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>. The invasion, which followed the inconclusive <a href="Iran%E2%80%93Iraq%20War">Iran–Iraq War</a> and three decades of political conflict with Kuwait, offered Saddam Hussein the opportunity to distract political dissent at home and add Kuwait's oil resources to Iraq's own, a boon in a time of declining petroleum prices.

In response, the United Nations began to pass a series of resolutions demanding the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Afraid that <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> would be invaded next, the Saudi Arabian government requested immediate military aid. As a result, the United States began marshalling forces from a variety of nations, styled the <a href="Coalition%20of%20the%20Gulf%20War">Coalition</a>, on the <a href="Arabian%20peninsula">Arabian peninsula</a>. Initially, Saddam Hussein attempted to deter Coalition military action by threatening Kuwait's and Iraq's petroleum production and export. In December 1990, Iraq experimented with the use of explosives to destroy wellheads in the area of the Ahmadi loading complex, developing their capability to destroy Kuwait's petroleum infrastructure on a large scale. On 16 January, Iraqi artillery destroyed an oil storage tank in Khafji, Saudi Arabia, and on 19 January the pumps at the Ahmadi loading complex were opened, pouring crude oil into the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>. The oil flowed into the sea at a rate of 200,000 barrels a day, becoming one of the worst ecological disasters to that date.

Despite these Iraqi threats, the Coalition launched a 38-day aerial campaign on 17 January 1991. Flying an estimated 2,000 sorties a day, Coalition aircraft rapidly crippled the Iraqi air defense systems and effectively destroyed the <a href="Iraqi%20Air%20Force">Iraqi Air Force</a>, whose daily sortie rate plummeted from a prewar level of an estimated 200 per day to almost none by 17 January. On the third day of the campaign, many Iraqi pilots fled across the Iranian border in their aircraft rather than be destroyed. The air campaign also targeted command-and-control sites, bridges, railroads, and petroleum storage facilities.

Saddam Hussein, who is believed to have said, "The air force has never decided a war," nevertheless worried that the air campaign would erode Iraq's national morale. The Iraqi leader also believed that the United States would not be willing to lose many troops in action, and therefore sought to draw Coalition ground troops into a decisive battle. In an attempt to provoke a ground battle, he directed Iraqi forces to launch <a href="Scud">Scud</a> missiles against <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, while continuing to threaten the destruction of oilfields in Kuwait. These efforts were unsuccessful in provoking a large ground battle, so Saddam Hussein decided to launch a limited offensive into Saudi Arabia with the aim of inflicting heavy losses on the Coalition armies.

As the air campaign continued, the Coalition's expectations of an Iraqi offensive decreased. As a result, the United States redeployed the <a href="XVIII%20Airborne%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">XVIII Airborne Corps</a> and the <a href="VII%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">VII Corps</a> 480 kilometers (300 mi) to the west. The Coalition's leadership believed that should an Iraqi force go on the offensive, it would be launched from the al-Wafra oil fields, in Southern Kuwait.

The Iraqi Army had between 350,000 and 500,000 soldiers in theater, organized into 51 divisions, including eight <a href="Iraqi%20Republican%20Guard">Republican Guard</a> divisions. Republican Guard units normally received the newest equipment; for example, most of the estimated 1,000 <a href="T-72">T-72</a> tanks in the Iraqi Army on the eve of the war were in Republican Guard divisions. The Iraqi Army in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations (KTO) also included nine heavy divisions, composed mostly of professional soldiers, but with weapons of a generally lesser grade than those issued to the Republican Guard.

Most non-Republican Guard armored units had older tank designs, mainly the <a href="T-54/55">T-55</a> or its Chinese equivalents, the <a href="Type%2059%20tank">Type 59</a> and <a href="Type%2069">Type 69</a>. The remaining 34 divisions were composed of poorly trained conscripts. These divisions were deployed to channel the Coalition's forces through a number of break points along the front, allowing the Iraqi Army's heavy divisions and the Republican Guard units to isolate them and counterattack. However, the Iraqis left their western flank open, failing to account for tactics made possible by the <a href="Global%20Positioning%20System">Global Positioning System</a> and other new technologies.

In Saudi Arabia, the Coalition originally deployed over 200,000 soldiers, 750 aircraft and 1,200 tanks. This quickly grew to 3,600 tanks and over 600,000 personnel, of whom over 500,000 were from the United States.

Earmarked for the offensive into Saudi Arabia was the Iraqi Third Corps, the <a href="1st%20Division%20%28Iraq%29">1st Mechanized Division</a> from Fourth Corps and a number of commando units. Third Corps, commanded by Major General Salah Aboud Mahmoud (who would also command the overall offensive), had <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28Iraq%29">3rd Armored Division</a> and <a href="5th%20Division%20%28Iraq%29">5th Mechanized Division</a>, as well as a number of infantry divisions. Fourth Corps' commander was Major General Yaiyd Khalel Zaki. The 3rd Armored Division had a number of T-72 tanks, the only non-Republican Guard force to have them, while the other armored battalions had <a href="T-62">T-62</a>s and T-55s, a few of which had an Iraqi appliqué armor similar to the Soviet <a href="Reactive%20armour%23Non-explosive%20and%20non-energetic%20reactive%20armour">bulging armor</a> also known as "brow" laminate armor or BDD.

During the battle of Khafji, these upgraded T-55s survived impacts from <a href="MILAN">MILAN anti-tank missiles</a>. These divisions also had armored personnel vehicles such as the <a href="BMP-1">BMP-1</a>, scout vehicles such as the <a href="BRDM-2">BRDM-2</a>, and several types of artillery. Also deployed along this portion of the front, though not chosen to participate in the invasion, were five infantry divisions that were under orders to remain in their defensive positions along the border.
<a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">U.S. Marine Corps</a> reconnaissance estimated that the Iraqi Army had amassed around 60,000 troops across the border, near the Kuwaiti town of Wafra, in as many as 5 or 6 divisions. Infantry divisions normally consisted of three brigades with an attached commando unit, although some infantry divisions could have up to eight brigades–however most infantry divisions along the border were understrength, primarily due to <a href="desertion">desertion</a>.

Armored and mechanized divisions normally made use of three brigades, with each brigade having up to four combat battalions; depending on the division type, these were generally a three to one mix, with either three mechanized battalions and one armored battalion, or vice versa. Given the size of the forces deployed across the border, it is thought that the Iraqi Army planned to continue the offensive, after the successful capture of Khafji, in order to seize the valuable oil fields at Dammam.

The attack would consist of a four-prong offensive. The 1st Mechanized Division would pass through the 7th and 14th Infantry Divisions to protect the flank of the 3rd Armored Division, which would provide a blocking force west of Khafji while the 5th Mechanized Division took the town. The 1st Mechanized and 3rd Armored divisions would then retire to Kuwait, while the 5th Mechanized Division would wait until the Coalition launched a counteroffensive. The principal objectives were to inflict heavy casualties on the attacking Coalition soldiers and take prisoners of war, who Saddam Hussein theorized would be an excellent bargaining tool with the Coalition.

As the units moved to the Saudi Arabian border, many were attacked by Coalition aircraft. Around the Al-Wafrah forest, about 1,000 Iraqi armored fighting vehicles were attacked by <a href="Harrier%20Jump%20Jet">Harrier</a> aircraft with <a href="CBU-100%20Cluster%20Bomb">Rockeye cluster bombs</a>. Another Iraqi convoy of armored vehicles was hit by <a href="A-10%20Thunderbolt%20II">A-10s</a>, which destroyed the first and last vehicles, before systematically attacking the stranded remainders. Such air raids prevented the majority of the Iraqi troops deployed for the offensive from taking part in it.
During the buildup of forces, the U.S. had built <a href="observation%20post">observation post</a>s along the Kuwaiti-Saudi Arabian border to gather intelligence on Iraqi forces. These were manned by <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20SEALs">U.S. Navy SEALs</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps%20Force%20Reconnaissance">U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance</a> and <a href="Special%20Forces%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">Army Special Forces</a> personnel. Observation post 8 was farthest to the east, on the coast, and another seven observation posts were positioned each until the end of the "heel", the geographic panhandle of southernmost Kuwait. Observation posts 8 and 7 overlooked the coastal highway that ran to Khafji, considered the most likely invasion route of the city. <a href="1st%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Marine Division</a> had three companies positioned at observation posts 4, 5 and 6 (Task Force Shepard), while the <a href="2nd%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">2nd Marine Division</a>'s <a href="2nd%20Light%20Armored%20Reconnaissance%20Battalion">2nd Light Armored Infantry Battalion</a> set up a screen between observation post 1 and the Al-Wafrah oil fields. The U.S. Army's <a href="2nd%20Armored%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">2nd Armored Division</a> provided its 1st Tiger Brigade to give the Marines some much needed armored support.

The Saudi Arabians gave responsibility for the defense of Khafji to the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade, attached to Task Force Abu Bakr. The 5th Battalion of the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade set up a screen north and west of Khafji, under observation post 7. At the time, a Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade could have up to four motorized battalions, each with three line companies. The brigade had a nominal strength of an estimated 5,000 soldiers. The Saudi Arabians also deployed the Tariq Task Force, composed of Saudi Arabian marines, a Moroccan mechanized infantry battalion, and two Senegalese infantry companies. Two further task forces, Othman and Omar Task Forces, consisted of two Mechanized Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigades, providing screens about south of the border. The road south of Khafji was covered by one battalion of Saudi Arabian National Guard supported by one battalion of Qatari tanks. The country's main defenses were placed south of the screen.

The majority of the Arab contingent was led by General Khaled bin Sultan. The forces around Khafji were organized into the Joint Forces Command-East, while Joint Forces Command-North defended the border between observation post 1 and the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border.

On 27 January 1991, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein met in <a href="Basra">Basra</a> with the two Iraqi army corps commanders who would lead the operation, and Major General Salah Mahmoud told him that Khafji would be his by 30 January. During his return trip to <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, Saddam Hussein's convoy was attacked by Coalition aircraft; the Iraqi leader escaped unscathed.

Throughout 28 January, the Coalition received a number of warnings suggesting an impending Iraqi offensive. The Coalition was flying two brand-new <a href="E-8%20Joint%20STARS">E-8A</a> Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) aircraft, which picked up the deployment and movement of Iraqi forces to the area opposite of Khafji. Observation posts 2, 7 and 8 also detected heavy Iraqi reconnoitering along the border, and their small <a href="Air%20Naval%20Gunfire%20Liaison%20Company">teams of air-naval gunfire liaison Marines</a> called in air and artillery strikes throughout the day. Lieutenant Colonel Richard Barry, commander of the forward headquarters of the 1st Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Intelligence Group, sent warnings about an impending attack to <a href="United%20States%20Central%20Command">Central Command</a>. CentCom leaders were too preoccupied with the air campaign to heed them however, and so the Iraqi operation came as a surprise.

The Iraqi offensive began on the night of 29 January, when approximately 2,000 soldiers in several hundred armored fighting vehicles moved south. The Gulf War's first ground engagement was near observation post 4, built on the Al-Zabr police building. Elements of the Iraqi 6th Armored Brigade, ordered to take the heights above Al-Zabr, engaged Coalition units at Al-Zabr. At 20:00 hours, U.S. Marines at the observation post, who had noticed large groups of armored vehicles through their night vision devices, attempted to talk to battalion headquarters but received no response. Contact was not established until 20:30 hours, which prompted Task Force Shepard to respond to the threat. Coalition soldiers at observation post 4 opened fire on the Iraqi column, but this largely ineffective fire drew a heavy Iraqi response which forced the company to retire south, by order of its commanding officer.

To cover the withdrawal, the company's platoon of <a href="LAV-25">LAV-25</a>s and LAV-ATs (anti-tank variants) moved to engage the Iraqi force. After receiving permission, one of the anti-tank vehicles opened fire at what it believed was an Iraqi tank. Instead, the missile destroyed a friendly LAV-AT a few hundred meters in front of it. Despite this loss, the platoon continued forward and soon opened fire on the Iraqi tanks with the LAV-25s' autocannons. The fire could not penetrate the tanks' armor, but did damage their optics and prevented the tanks from fighting back effectively.

Soon thereafter, a number of A-10 ground-attack aircraft arrived but found it difficult to pinpoint enemy targets and began dropping flares to illuminate the zone. One of these flares landed on a friendly vehicle, and although the vehicle radioed in its position, it was hit by an <a href="AGM-65%20Maverick">AGM-65 Maverick</a> air-to-ground missile that killed the entire crew except for the driver. Following the incident, the company was withdrawn and the remaining vehicles reorganized into another nearby company. With observation post 4 cleared, the Iraqi 6th Armored Brigade withdrew over the border to Al-Wafrah under heavy fire from Coalition aircraft. Coalition forces had lost 11 troops to <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a> and none to enemy action.

While the events at observation post 4 were unfolding, the Iraqi 5th Mechanized Division crossed the Saudi Arabian border near observation post 1. A Company of the 2nd Light Infantry Armored Battalion, which was screening the Iraqi unit, reported a column of 60–100 BMPs. The column was engaged by Coalition A-10s and Harrier jump jets. This was then followed by another column with an estimated 29 tanks. One of the column's T-62 tanks was engaged by an anti-tank missile and destroyed. Coalition air support, provided by A-10s and <a href="F-16">F-16</a>s, engaged the Iraqi drive through observation post 1 and ultimately repulsed the attack back over the Kuwaiti border. Aircraft continued to engage the columns throughout the night, until the next morning. Another column of Iraqi tanks, approaching observation post 2, were engaged by aircraft and also repulsed that night.
An additional Iraqi column crossed the Saudi Arabian border to the East, although still along the coast, towards the city of Khafji. These Iraqi tanks were screened by the 5th Mechanized Battalion of the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade. This battalion withdrew when it came under heavy fire, as it had been ordered to not engage the Iraqi column. Elements of the 8th and 10th Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigades also conducted similar screening operations. Due to the order to not engage, the road to Khafji was left open. At one point, Iraqi T-55s of another column rolled up to the Saudi Arabian border, signaling that they intended to surrender. As they were approached by Saudi Arabian troops, they reversed their turrets and opened fire. This prompted air support from a nearby <a href="Lockheed%20AC-130">AC-130</a>, destroying 13 vehicles.

Nevertheless, the Iraqi advance towards Khafji continued on this sector, despite repeated attacks from an AC-130. Attempts by the Saudi Arabian commanders to call in additional air strikes on the advancing Iraqi column failed when the requested heavy air support never arrived. Khafji was occupied by approximately 00:30 on 30 January, trapping two six-man reconnaissance teams from the 1st Marine Division in the city. The teams occupied two apartment buildings in the southern sector of the city and called artillery fire on their position to persuade the Iraqis to call off a search of the area. Throughout the night, Coalition air support composed of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft continued to engage Iraqi tanks and artillery.

Distressed by the occupation of Khafji, Saudi Arabian commander General Khaled bin Sultan appealed to U.S. General <a href="Norman%20Schwarzkopf">Norman Schwarzkopf</a> for an immediate air campaign against Iraqi forces in and around the city. However this was turned down because the buildings would make it difficult for aircraft to spot targets without getting too close. It was instead decided that the city would be retaken by Arab ground forces. The task fell to the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 7th Battalion, composed of Saudi Arabian infantry with <a href="Cadillac%20Gage%20Commando">V-150 armored cars</a> and two Qatari tank companies attached to the task force. These were supported by U.S. Army Special Forces and Marine Reconnaissance personnel.

The force was put under the command of Saudi Arabian Lieutenant Colonel Matar, who moved out by 17:00 hours. The force met up with elements of the <a href="3rd%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. 3rd Marine Regiment</a>, south of Khafji, and were ordered to directly attack the city. A platoon of Iraqi T-55s attacked south of the city, leading to the destruction of three <a href="T-55">T-55</a>s by Qatari <a href="AMX-30">AMX-30</a>s, and the capture of a fourth Iraqi tank. Lacking any coordinated artillery support, artillery fire was provided by the 10th Marine Regiment.
An initial attack on the city was called off after the Iraqi occupants opened up with heavy fire, prompting the Saudi Arabians to reinforce the 7th Battalion with two more companies from adjacent Saudi Arabian units. The attempt to retake the city had been preceded by a 15-minute preparatory fire from U.S. Marine artillery. However Iraqi fire did manage to destroy one Saudi Arabian V-150.

Meanwhile, 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 5th Battalion moved north of Khafji to block Iraqi reinforcements attempting to reach the city. This unit was further bolstered by the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade, and heavily aided by Coalition air support. Although fear of friendly fire forced the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade to pull back the following morning, Coalition aircraft successfully hindered Iraqi attempts to move more soldiers down to Khafji and caused large numbers of Iraqi troops to surrender to Saudi Arabian forces.

That night, two U.S. Army heavy equipment transporters entered the city of Khafji, apparently lost, and were fired upon by Iraqi troops. Although one truck managed to turn around and escape, the two drivers of the second truck were wounded and captured. This led to a rescue mission organized by <a href="3rd%20Battalion%203rd%20Marines">3rd Battalion 3rd Marine Regiment</a>, which sent a force of 30 men to extract the two wounded drivers. Although encountering no major opposition, they did not find the two drivers who had, by this time, been taken prisoner. The Marines did find a burnt out Kuwaiti AMX-30, with its dead crew. In the early morning hours, despite significant risk to their safety, an AC-130 providing overwatch stayed beyond sunrise. It was shot down by an Iraqi <a href="surface-to-air%20missile">surface-to-air missile</a> (SAM), killing the aircraft's crew of 14.

The interdiction on the part of Coalition aircraft and Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti ground forces was having an effect on the occupying Iraqi troops. Referring to Saddam Hussein's naming of the ground engagement as the "mother of all battles", Iraqi General Salah radioed in a request to withdraw, stating, "The mother was killing her children." Since the beginning of the battle, Coalition aircraft had flown at least 350 sorties against Iraqi units in the area and on the night of 30–31 January, Coalition air support also began to attack units of the Iraqi Third Corps assembled on the Saudi Arabian border.

On 31 January, the effort to retake the city began anew. The attack was launched at 08:30 hours, and was met by heavy but mostly inaccurate Iraqi fire, however three Saudi Arabian V-150 armored cars were knocked out by <a href="RPG-7">RPG-7</a>s at close range. The 8th battalion of the Saudi Arabian brigade was ordered to deploy to the city by 10:00 hours, while 5th Battalion to the north engaged another column of Iraqi tanks attempting to reach the city. The latter engagement led to the destruction of around 13 Iraqi tanks and armored personnel carriers, and the capture of 6 more vehicles and 116 Iraqi soldiers, costing the Saudi Arabian battalion two dead and two wounded. The 8th Battalion engaged the city from the northeast, linking up with 7th Battalion. These units cleared the southern portion of the city, until 7th Battalion withdrew south to rest and rearm at 18:30 hours, while the 8th remained in Khafji. The two Qatari tank companies, with U.S. Marine artillery and air support, moved north of the city to block Iraqi reinforcements.

The 8th continued clearing buildings and by the time the 7th had withdrawn to the south, the Saudi Arabians had lost approximately 18 dead and 50 wounded, as well as seven V-150 vehicles. Coalition aircraft continued to provide heavy support throughout the day and night. A veteran of the Iran-Iraq War later mentioned that Coalition airpower "imposed more damage on his brigade in half an hour than it had sustained in eight years of fighting against the Iranians." During the battle, an Iraqi amphibious force was sent to land on the coast and moved into Khafji. As the boats made their way through the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> towards Khafji, U.S. and British aircraft caught the Iraqi boats in the open and destroyed over 90% of the Iraqi amphibious force.

The Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti units renewed operations the following day. Two Iraqi companies, with about 20 armored vehicles, remained in the city and had not attempted to break out during the night. While the Saudi Arabian 8th Battalion continued operations in the southern portion of the city, the 7th Battalion began to clear the northern sector of the city. Iraqi resistance was sporadic and most Iraqi soldiers surrendered on sight; as a result, the city was recaptured on 1 February 1991.

During the battle, Coalition forces incurred 43 fatalities and 52 injured casualties. This included 25 Americans killed, 11 of them by <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a> along with 14 airmen killed when their <a href="Lockheed%20AC-130">AC-130</a> was shot down by Iraqi SAMs. The U.S. also had two soldiers wounded and another two soldiers were captured in Khafji. Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti casualties totaled 18 killed and 50 wounded. Two Kuwaiti <a href="AMX-30">AMX-30</a>s <a href="main%20battle%20tank">main battle tank</a>s and between seven and ten lightly armored Saudi Arabian V-150s were knocked out. Most of the V150s were knocked out by RPG-7 fire in close-range fighting inside the town of Khafji, although one of the two that was a catastrophic kill was hit by a 100mm main gun round from a T-55. Iraq listed its casualties as 71 dead, 148 wounded and 702 missing. U.S. sources present at the battle claim that 300 Iraqis lost their lives, and at least 90 vehicles were destroyed. Another source suggests that 60 Iraqi soldiers were killed and at least 400 taken prisoner, while no less than 80 armored vehicles were knocked out; however these casualties are attributed to the fighting both inside and directly north of Khafji. Whatever the exact casualties, the majority of three Iraqi mechanized/armored divisions had been destroyed. The U.S. Army's 2nd Armored Division's 1st Tiger Brigade claims 181 destroyed or captured enemy tanks, 148 APCs, 40 artillery pieces, 27 AA emplacements, 263 Iraqi dead and 4,051 captured after 100 hours of combat.

The Iraqi capture of Khafji was a major propaganda victory for Iraq: on 30 January Iraqi radio claimed that they had "expelled Americans from the Arab territory". For many in the Arab world, the battle of Khafji was seen as an Iraqi victory, and Hussein made every possible effort to turn the battle into a political victory. On the other side, confidence within the United States Armed Forces in the abilities of the Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti armies increased as the battle progressed. After Khafji, the Coalition's leadership began to sense that the Iraqi Army was a "hollow force" and it provided them with an impression of the degree of resistance they would face during the Coalition's ground offensive that would begin later that month. The battle was felt by the Saudi Arabian government to be a major propaganda victory, which had successfully defended its territory.

Despite the success of the engagements between 29 January and 1 February, the Coalition did not launch its main offensive into Kuwait and Iraq until the night of 24–25 February. The invasion of Iraq was completed about 48 hours later. The Battle of Khafji served as a modern example of the ability of air power to serve a supporting role to ground forces. It offered the Coalition an indication of the manner in which <a href="Operation%20Desert%20Storm">Operation Desert Storm</a> would be fought, but also hinted at future friendly-fire casualties which accounted for nearly half of the U.S. dead.

Joseph Szigeti

[[File:Szigeti.png|thumb|Joseph Szigeti]]

Joseph Szigeti (, ; 5 September 189219 February 1973) was a Hungarian [[violin]]ist.

Born into a musical family, he spent his early childhood in a small town in [[Transylvania]]. He quickly proved himself to be a child prodigy on the violin, and moved to [[Budapest]] with his father to study with the renowned [[pedagogue]] [[Jenő Hubay]]. After completing his studies with Hubay in his early teens, Szigeti began his international concert career. His performances at that time were primarily limited to salon-style recitals and the more overtly virtuosic repertoire; however, after making the acquaintance of pianist [[Ferruccio Busoni]], he began to develop a much more thoughtful and intellectual approach to music that eventually earned him the nickname "The Scholarly Virtuoso".

Following a bout of [[tuberculosis]] that required a stay in a [[sanatorium]] in [[Switzerland]], Szigeti settled in [[Geneva]], where he became Professor of Violin at the local conservatory in 1917. It was in Geneva that he met his future wife, Wanda Ostrowska, and at roughly the same time he became friends with the composer [[Béla Bartók]]. Both relationships were to be lifelong.

From the 1920s until 1960, Szigeti performed regularly around the world and recorded extensively. He also distinguished himself as a strong advocate of new music, and was the dedicatee of many new works by contemporary composers. Among the more notable pieces written for him are [[Ernest Bloch]]'s Violin Concerto, Bartók's "[[Rhapsody No. 1 (Bartók)|Rhapsody No. 1]]", and [[Eugène Ysaÿe]]'s [[Six Sonatas for solo violin (Ysaÿe)#Sonata No. 1, G minor, "Joseph Szigeti"|Solo Sonata No. 1]]. After retiring from the concert stage in 1960, he worked at teaching and writing until his death in 1973, at the age of 80.

[[Image:07.zori in Valeni.2.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Scene from Máramaros county, near Szigeti's childhood home]]
Szigeti was born Joseph "Jóska" Singer to a Jewish family in [[Budapest]], [[Austria-Hungary]]. His mother died when he was three years old, and soon thereafter the boy was sent to live with his grandparents in the little [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] town of [[Sighetu Marmaţiei|Máramaros-Sziget]] (hence the name "Szigeti"). He grew up surrounded by music, as the town band was composed almost entirely of his uncles. After a few informal lessons on the "[[cimbalom]]" from his aunt, he received his first lessons on the violin from his Uncle Bernat at the age of six.

Szigeti quickly showed a talent for the violin. Several years later, his father took him to Budapest to receive proper training at the [[College or university school of music|conservatory]]. After a brief stint with an inadequate teacher, Szigeti auditioned at the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]] and was admitted directly into the class of [[Jenő Hubay]], without the usual delays and formalities.

Hubay, who had been a student of [[Joseph Joachim]] in [[Berlin]], had by that time established himself as one of the preeminent teachers in Europe and a fountainhead of the Hungarian violin tradition. Szigeti joined such violinists as [[Franz von Vecsey]], [[Emil Telmányi]], [[Jelly d'Arányi]] and [[Stefi Geyer]] in Hubay's studio.
In those days, Europe produced a great many [[Child prodigy|child prodigies]], inspired by the phenomenal success of the young Czech virtuoso [[Jan Kubelík]] and formed by rigorous teaching and enthusiastic parents. The Hubay studio was no exception; Szigeti and his fellow "[[Child prodigy|wunderkinder]]" performed extensively in special recitals and salon concerts during their study at the Liszt Academy.

In 1905, at the age of thirteen, Szigeti made his Berlin debut playing [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's]] "[[Partita for Violin No. 2 (Bach)|Chaconne in D minor]]", [[Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst|Ernst's]] [[Concerto]] in F-sharp minor, and [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini's]] "Witches Dance". Despite the formidable program, the event received mention only by a photograph in the Sunday supplement of the "[[Berliner Tageblatt]]" captioned: "A Musical Prodigy: Josef Szigeti".
[[File:Joseph Szigeti and Jeno Hubay c1910.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hubay (left) and Szigeti, c. 1910]]
Szigeti spent the next few months with a summer theater company in a small Hungarian resort town, playing mini-recitals in between acts of folk [[operetta]]. In that same vein, the next year he played at a circus in [[Frankfurt]], where he appeared under the pseudonym "Jóska Szulagi". Also in 1906, Hubay took Szigeti to play for Joseph Joachim in Berlin. Joachim was impressed, and suggested that Szigeti should finish his studies with him. Szigeti declined the offer, both out of loyalty to Hubay and a perceived aloofness and lack of rapport between Joachim and his students.

Soon after the meeting with Joachim, Szigeti embarked on a major concert tour of England. Midway through the tour, in [[Surrey]], he met a music-loving couple who effectively adopted him, extending an invitation to stay with them for an indefinite length of time.

Throughout England, he gave many successful concerts, including the premiere of the first work dedicated to him: [[Hamilton Harty]]'s Violin Concerto. Also during this time, Szigeti toured with an all-star ensemble including legendary singer [[Nellie Melba|Dame Nellie Melba]] and pianists [[Ferruccio Busoni]] and [[Wilhelm Backhaus]]. [[Philippe Gaubert]], a famous French flutist of the day, as well as the young singer [[John McCormack (tenor)|John McCormack]], were also part of these tours.
[[Image:Ferruccio Busoni, ca 1895.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Szigeti's mentor, Ferruccio Busoni]]
The most significant of the new contacts was Busoni. The great pianist and composer became Szigeti's mentor during these formative years, and the two would remain close friends until Busoni's death in 1924. By Szigeti's own admission, before meeting Busoni his life was characterized by a certain laziness and indifference brought on by the then-typical life of a young prodigy violinist. He had grown accustomed to playing crowd-pleasing salon miniatures and dazzling virtuosic encores without much thought. He knew little of the works of the great masters; he could play them, but not fully understand them. As Szigeti put it, Busoni—particularly through their careful study of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's]] [[Partita for Violin No. 2 (Bach)|"Chaconne"]]—"shook me once and for all out of my adolescent complacency".

In 1913, Szigeti was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and was sent to a [[sanatorium]] in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]] to recover, interrupting his concert career. During his stay at the sanatorium, he became re-acquainted with the composer [[Béla Bartók]], who was recovering from [[pneumonia]]. The two had known each other only in passing during their conservatory days, but now they began a friendship that would last until Bartók's death in 1945.

In 1917, having by then made a full recovery, at age 25 Szigeti was appointed Professor of Violin at the [[Conservatoire de Musique de Genève|Geneva Conservatory of Music]]. Szigeti said that this job, although generally satisfying, was often frustrating due to the mediocre quality of many of his students. The years teaching in Geneva provided an opportunity for Szigeti to deepen his understanding of music as an art, along with other aspects such as chamber music, orchestral performance, music theory and composition. Also during that time, Szigeti met and fell in love with Wanda Ostrowska, a young woman of Russian parentage who had been stranded in Geneva by the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] of 1917. They married in 1919.

In 1925, Szigeti met [[Leopold Stokowski]] and played the Bach "Chaconne in D minor" for him. Less than two weeks later, Szigeti received a telegram from Stokowski's manager in [[Philadelphia]] inviting him to perform with the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] later that year: it was his American debut. Szigeti had never played with an American orchestra before, nor heard one, and later he wrote of suffering [[stage fright]]. He was taken aback by the American concert scene, and the way that its publicity and popularity driven agents and managers determined much of what was heard in American concert halls. He believed they were not interested in works by the great masters, but preferred the popular light salon pieces he had left behind in his prodigy days. (To the end of his life, Szigeti loved to quote one memorable, cigar-chewing impresario who told him, with regard to [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s "[[Violin Sonata No. 9 (Beethoven)|Kreutzer Sonata]]", "Well, let me tell you, Mister Dzigedy—and I know what "I’m" talking about—your Krewtzer Sonata bores the pants off my audiences!")

By 1930, Szigeti was established as a major international concert violinist. He performed extensively in Europe, the United States and Asia, and made the acquaintance of many of the era's leading instrumentalists, conductors and composers.

[[Image:Bartók Béla 1927.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Béla Bartók, Szigeti's longtime friend and colleague]]
In 1939, to escape the war and [[Nazi]] persecution of the Jews, Szigeti emigrated with his wife to the United States, where they settled in [[California]]. (A year later, Bartók also fled to America, and just two days after his arrival, he and Szigeti played a sonata recital at the [[Library of Congress]] in [[Washington, D.C.]])

During the 1930s, 1940s and into the 1950s, Szigeti recorded extensively, leaving a significant legacy. Notable recordings include the above-mentioned Library of Congress sonata recital; the studio recording of Bartók's "[[Contrasts (Bartók)|Contrasts]]" with [[Benny Goodman]] on clarinet and the composer at the piano; the violin concertos of [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Beethoven]], [[Violin Concerto (Brahms)|Brahms]], [[Violin Concerto (Mendelssohn)|Mendelssohn]], [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Prokofiev)|Prokofiev]] (No. 1) and [[Ernest Bloch|Bloch]] under the batons of such conductors as [[Bruno Walter]], [[Hamilton Harty]] and Sir [[Thomas Beecham]]; and various works by J.S. Bach, Busoni, [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]], [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. One of his last recordings was of the "[[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin (Bach)|Six Sonatas and Partitas]]" for solo violin by Bach; although his technique had deteriorated noticeably by that time, the recording is prized for Szigeti's insight and depth of interpretation.

In 1950, Szigeti was detained at [[Ellis Island]] upon returning from a European concert tour and was held for several days, officially "temporarily excluded" from the country. The reasons for his detention remain unclear. The following year, he became a naturalized American citizen.

[[Image:Montreux 1 um 1900.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Montreux, Switzerland, where Szigeti spent his later years]]
During the 1950s, Szigeti began to develop [[arthritis]] in his hands and his playing deteriorated. Despite his weakened technical mastery, his intellect and musical expression were still strong, and he continued to draw large audiences to his concerts. In [[Naples]], Italy, in November 1956, just after the Soviets crushed the Hungarian uprising, as soon as he walked onto the stage the audience burst into wild applause and shouts of "Viva l’Ungheria!" (Italian for "Long live Hungary!"), delaying the concert for nearly fifteen minutes.

In 1960 Szigeti officially retired from performing, and returned to [[Switzerland]] with his wife. There he devoted himself primarily to teaching, although he still traveled regularly to judge international violin competitions. Top-class students from all over Europe and the United States came to study under him. One of these students was [[Arnold Steinhardt]], who spent the summer of 1962 with Szigeti. He came to the conclusion that "Joseph Szigeti was a template for the musician I would like to become: inquisitive, innovative, sensitive, feeling, informed".

Toward the end of his life, Szigeti suffered from frail health. He was put on strict diets and had several stays in hospital, but his friends asserted that this did nothing to dampen his characteristic cheerfulness. He died in [[Lucerne]], [[Switzerland]] on February 19, 1973, at the age of 80. "The New York Times" ran a front-page obituary that ended with this 1966 quote from violinist [[Yehudi Menuhin]]:
We must be humbly grateful that the breed of cultured and chivalrous violin virtuosos, aristocrats as human beings and as musicians, has survived into our hostile age in the person of Joseph Szigeti.

In 1918, while teaching in Geneva, Szigeti met and fell in love with Wanda Ostrowska. She was born in Russia and had been stranded by the Russian Revolution of 1917 with her sister at a finishing school in Geneva. In 1919, Szigeti and Ostrowska decided to get married, but due to the turbulent political situation in Europe, many unexpected bureaucratic obstacles were thrown up in their path. The first problem was the impossibility of contacting Ostrowska's family, and the couple were forced to go ahead without parental consent, with the permission only of Ostrowska's sister and the headmistress of the finishing school. Further bureaucratic entanglements threatened the young couple's hopes, but eventually the officials responsible granted them a dispensation to marry. Szigeti recalls in his memoirs the words of Consul General Baron de Montlong at the critical moment: Let us not, if we can avoid it, fall victim to the dead letter of the law. I don't want to postpone the happiness of these two youngsters if we can help it. All laws have been twisted and tortured out of semblance of law, what with war and revolutions. For once let's twist and turn one for a good cause, yes?

Just before the birth of their only child, daughter Irene, Szigeti found himself stuck in Berlin during the [[Kapp Putsch]] of 1920, unable to return to Geneva. The entire city had been paralyzed by a general strike, and the trains were not running. His scheduled concert could not go on as planned, but he was forced to stay in Berlin for "interminable days" while the Putsch ran its course. Szigeti writes: "... the impossibility of communicating by phone or wire with my wife--whose condition I pictured with the somewhat lurid pessimism usual to young prospective fathers--was certainly a greater torment to me than all the other discomforts put together".

By 1940, the outbreak of [[World War II]] forced the Szigetis to leave Europe for the United States. (Irene remained in Switzerland, having married pianist [[Nikita Magaloff]] earlier that year.) They settled in California, where Wanda, always fond of nature, was delighted to be able to raise her own garden. In a letter to a friend, Szigeti describes their California life: Wanda is happy, doing wonders with her gardening, chicken and rabbit raising, preserve and pâté de foie making. She doesn't budge from our place, doesn't want to come back to New York even for a visit, which I, for one, can well understand! Two dogs, an aviary full of exotic birds, tomatoes, grapes, strawberries, asparagus, artichokes, lovely flowers (camellias too!), right in our own little world.

Szigeti narrowly escaped being killed in the plane crash that claimed the life of movie star [[Carole Lombard]] in January 1942. Szigeti, who was on his way to Los Angeles for a concert, was forced to give up his seat on [[TWA Flight 3]] at a refueling stop in Albuquerque, NM to allow the plane to take on 15 soldiers who, it being wartime, had priority. The plane, off course at night and with wartime blackout conditions in effect, crashed into a mountain cliff after take off from an intermediate stop in Las Vegas, killing everyone on board.

In 1960, the couple returned to Europe and settled near [[Lake Geneva]] in Switzerland, close to the home of their daughter and son-in-law. They remained there for the rest of their lives. Wanda died in 1971, predeceasing her husband by two years.

Writing in the "[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]", [[Boris Schwarz]] commented:
Szigeti's performing technique was not always flawless and his tone lacked sensuous beauty, although it acquired a spiritual quality in moments of inspiration ... Szigeti held the bow in an old-fashioned way, with the elbow close to the body, and produced much emphatic power, but not without extraneous sounds. Minor reservations, however, were swept aside by the force of his musical personality.
This comment illustrates well the general nature of Szigeti's reception by both critics and fellow musicians: while his musical insights, intellect, and depth of interpretation were almost universally lauded, the purely technical aspect of his playing was awarded a more mixed reaction. His tone in particular seems to have been occasionally uneven from performance to performance. A 1926 recital review in "The New York Times," for example, laments that ... his performance was stiff and dry in its observance of letter and its absence of spirit ... Mr. Szigeti was not only inclined to dryness of tone and angularity of phrase, but there were also passages of poor intonation. In contrast, a review from the previous year in the same journal remarked after a performance of the Beethoven concerto that Mr. Szigeti has a rather small but beautiful tone, elegance, finish. He played with a quiet sincerity which grew upon the audience, though not with the virility and sweep that other violinists find ... it is clear that Mr. Szigeti is a player to command esteem and respect for his musicianship, for the genuineness of his interpretations, and his artistic style.

Among his fellow musicians, Szigeti was widely admired and respected. Violinist [[Nathan Milstein]] wrote that Szigeti... was an incredibly cultured musician. Actually his talent grew out of his culture ... I always admired him, and he was respected by musicians ... in his late years, he finally got the appreciation he deserved from the general public as well.
In his memoirs, published in 2004, cellist [[János Starker]] asserts that Szigeti was one of the giants among the violinists I had heard from childhood on, and my admiration for him is undiminished up to this day.

Starker then describes a recital he attended late in Szigeti's career, illustrating both the extent to which Szigeti was suffering from arthritis and his ability to still communicate his musical ideas effectively: 
"He invited me to his recital in Town Hall ... the first few minutes were excruciating: as I saw later, his fingers had deteriorated to the point that he had almost no flesh on them. But once he loosened up a bit he produced heart-rending beauty.

Violinist [[Yehudi Menuhin]] comments at length about Szigeti in his own memoirs, remarking as many others did on Szigeti's intellectual approach to music, but in a somewhat more critical fashion:
Apart from [[George Enescu|Enesco]], he was the most cultivated violinist I have ever known but while Enesco was a force of nature, Szigeti, slender, small, anxious, was a beautifully fashioned piece of porcelain, a priceless Sèvres vase. Curiously for a Hungarian, from whom one expects wild, energetic, spontaneous qualities, Szigeti travelled even farther up a one-way road of deliberate intellectualism. A young accompanist who worked with Szigeti told me that two hours concentration wouldn't get them beyond the first three bars of a sonata--so much analysis and ratiocination went into his practice ... A similar persnicketiness marked his adjudication. Shortly before he died in 1973, he was a member of our jury at the City of London Carl Flesch Concours ... I was struck not only by the sharpness of his intellect but also by what seemed to me the perversity of his opinions. Some particular aspect of a competitor's playing would hold his attention, and he would take violent issue with it, to the exclusion of everything else. For him a violinist was made or broken, a prize awarded or withheld, on details that to me scarcely mattered.

Nevertheless, Menuhin too referred to Szigeti as "a violinist whom I much admired and a man of whom I was very fond".

During his time in America, Szigeti took to writing; his memoirs, "With Strings Attached: Reminiscences and Reflections" were published in 1947. "[[The New York Times]]" reviewed it favorably: although in their description the book was "constructed along utterly anarchistic lines, with each episode and anecdote left pretty much on its own", they asserted that "It also has the flavor of life in it, and it is marked by an exhilarating revolt against the custom of arranging catastrophes and triumphs under neat chapter headings".

In 1969, he published his treatise on violin playing, "Szigeti on the Violin". In it Szigeti presents his opinions about the then-current state of violin playing and the various challenges and issues facing musicians in the modern world, as well as a detailed examination of violin technique as he understood it.

A recurring theme in the first part is the changing nature of violinist's lives during Szigeti's later years. In his youth, concert artists relied primarily on recitals to establish themselves and attract critical attention and acclaim; by the time of Szigeti's writings, the recital had been eclipsed in importance by the competition. Szigeti was dismayed by this trend, especially since he considered the fast-paced and intense preparation necessary for high-level competitions to be "…incompatible with the slow maturing either of the performing artist or of the repertoire."
Szigeti believed that such accelerated development of a musician led to performances that "lack(ed) the stamp of authenticity, the mark of a personal view evolved through trial and error." In a similar vein, he was skeptical of the effects produced by the recording industry on the culture of music-making. In Szigeti's opinion, the allure of the recording contract and the instant "success" that it implied led many young artists to record works before they were musically ready, and thus contributed to the problem of artificially fast development and resulting musical immaturity.

Szigeti also offers a lengthy and detailed explanation of his approach to violin technique. He believed that a violinist should be concerned primarily with musical goals, rather than simply choosing either the easiest or most impressively virtuosic way to play a certain passage. He was particularly concerned with [[timbre|tone color]]: he advised that "The player should cultivate a seismograph-like sensitivity to brusque changes of tone colour caused by fingerings based on expediency and comfort rather than the composer’s manifest or probable intentions." Other topics prominently discussed include the most effective position of a violinist's left hand, the violin works of [[Béla Bartók]], a cautionary list of widely accepted misprints and editorial inaccuracies in the standard repertoire, and most notably, the vital importance of [[J.S. Bach]]'s Six Sonatas and Partitas for any violinist's technical and artistic development.

Szigeti was an avid champion of new music, and frequently planned his recitals to include new or little-known works alongside the classics. Many composers wrote new works for him, notably [[Béla Bartók]], [[Ernest Bloch]], and [[Eugène Ysaÿe]], along with lesser-known composers such as [[David Diamond (composer)|David Diamond]] and [[Hamilton Harty]].

The reason for Szigeti's appeal to composers was articulated by Bloch upon completion of his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere would have to be delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music.

Szigeti was also the dedicatee of the first of [[Eugène Ysaÿe]]'s [[Six Sonatas for solo violin (Ysaÿe)|Six Sonatas for Solo Violin]]; in fact, Ysaÿe's inspiration to compose the sonatas came from hearing Szigeti's performances of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s [[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin (Bach)|Six Sonatas and Partitas]], to which they are intended as a modern counterpart.

Perhaps Szigeti's most fruitful musical partnership was with his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the [[Rhapsody No. 1 (Bartók)|First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra]] (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, was one of a pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to [[Zoltán Székely]].) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist [[Benny Goodman]] teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78 rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement "[[Contrasts (Bartók)|Contrasts]]" for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression. He was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would never sell to an American audience. Szigeti came to his friend's aid by securing donations from the American Society of Composers and Publishers to pay for Bartók's medical treatment, and then, together with conductor and compatriot [[Fritz Reiner]], persuaded [[Serge Koussevitzky]] to commission from Bartók what eventually became his much-beloved [[Concerto for Orchestra (Bartók)|Concerto for Orchestra]]. The work's success brought Bartók some measure of financial security and provided him with a much-needed emotional boost.

As well as performing new works dedicated to him, Szigeti also championed the music of other contemporary composers, notably [[Sergei Prokofiev]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]]. He was among the first violinists to make Prokofiev's [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Prokofiev)|First Violin Concerto]] a standard part of his repertoire, and frequently performed and recorded works of Stravinsky (including the Duo Concertante, recorded with the composer at the piano in 1945.) The [[Alban Berg|Berg]] [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]] he even recorded twice, under the baton of [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]]. Most famously, Szigeti recorded the Bloch concerto, a premier recording made in 1939 with the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire conducted by Charles Munch (originally released on Columbia LP and reissued on Membran CD).

Ramesses VI

Ramesses VI Nebmaatre-Meryamun (sometimes written Ramses or Rameses, also known under his princely name of Amenherkhepshef C) was the fifth ruler of the <a href="Twentieth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt</a>. He reigned for about eight years in the mid-to-late <a href="12th%20century%20BC">12th century BC</a> and was a son of <a href="Ramesses%20III">Ramesses III</a> and queen <a href="Iset%20Ta-Hemdjert">Iset Ta-Hemdjert</a>. As a prince, he was known as Ramesses Amunherkhepeshef and held the titles of royal scribe and cavalry general. He was succeeded by his son, <a href="Ramesses%20VII">Ramesses VII Itamun</a>, whom he had fathered with queen <a href="Nubkhesbed">Nubkhesbed</a>.

After the death of the ruling pharaoh, <a href="Ramesses%20V">Ramesses V</a>, who was the son of Ramesses VI's older brother, <a href="Ramesses%20IV">Ramesses IV</a>, Ramesses VI ascended the throne. In the first two years after his <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20pharaoh">coronation</a>, Ramesses VI stopped frequent raids by Libyan or Egyptian marauders in Upper Egypt and buried his predecessor in what is now an unknown tomb of the Theban necropolis. Ramesses VI usurped <a href="KV9">KV9</a>, a tomb in the <a href="Valley%20of%20the%20Kings">Valley of the Kings</a> planned by and for Ramesses V, and had it enlarged and redecorated for himself. The craftsmen's huts near the entrance of KV9 covered up the entrance to <a href="KV62">Tutankhamun's tomb</a>, saving it from a wave of tomb robberies that occurred within 20 years of Ramesses VI's death. Ramesses VI may have planned and made six more tombs in the <a href="Valley%20of%20the%20Queens">Valley of the Queens</a>, none which are known today.

Egypt lost control of its last strongholds in <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a> around the time of Ramesses VI's reign. Though Egyptian occupation in <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a> continued, the loss of the Asiatic territories strained Egypt's weakening economy and increased prices. With construction projects increasingly hard to fund, Ramesses VI usurped the monuments of his forefathers by engraving his cartouches over theirs. Yet he boasted of having "[covered] all the land with great monuments in my name [...] built in honour of my fathers the gods". He was fond of cult statues of himself; more are known to portray him than any Twentieth-Dynasty king after Ramesses III. The Egyptologist Amin Amer characterises Ramesses VI as "a king who wished to pose as a great pharaoh in an age of unrest and decline".

The pharaoh's power waned in Upper Egypt during Ramesses VI's rule. Though his daughter <a href="Iset%20%28priestess%29">Iset</a> was named <a href="God%27s%20Wife%20of%20Amun">God's Wife of Amun</a>, the <a href="High%20Priests%20of%20Amun">high-priest of Amun</a>, <a href="Ramessesnakht">Ramessesnakht</a>, turned Thebes into Egypt's religious capital and a second center of power on par with <a href="Pi-Ramesses">Pi-Ramesses</a> in <a href="Lower%20Egypt">Lower Egypt</a>, where the pharaoh resided. In spite of these developments, there is no evidence that Ramessesnakht's dynasty worked against royal interests, which suggests that the Ramesside kings may have approved of these evolutions.
Ramesses VI died in his forties, in his eighth or ninth year of rule. His mummy lay untouched in his tomb for fewer than 20 years before pillagers damaged it. The body was moved to <a href="KV35">KV35</a> during the reign of <a href="Pinedjem%20I">Pinedjem I</a>, and was discovered in 1898.

Ramesses VI was a son of <a href="Ramesses%20III">Ramesses III</a>, the latter being considered the last great pharaoh of the <a href="New%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">New Kingdom period</a>. This filiation is established beyond doubt by a large relief found in the portico of the <a href="Medinet%20Habu%20%28temple%29">Medinet Habu temple</a> of Ramesses III known as the "Procession of the Princes". The relief shows ten princes including Ramesses VI, worshipping their father. Ramesses III's sculptors seem to have left the relief incomplete; only the figures of the king and princes appear and no names are written in the spaces next to them. The relief seems to have originally been executed when Ramesses VI was still a young prince, as he is shown wearing the <a href="sidelock%20of%20youth">sidelock of youth</a> used to denote childhood.
When Ramesses VI became king, he added his princely names "Ramesses Amunherkhepeshef" inside <a href="Cartouche">royal cartouches</a> as well as the titles he held before ascending the throne as "king's son of his body, his beloved, <a href="Iry-pat">crown prince</a>, royal scribe [and] cavalry general". He altered his youthful figure on the "Procession of the Princes" with an <a href="uraeus">uraeus</a> underscoring his royal status and further completed the relief with the names of all his brothers and sons, with the exception of Ramesses IV, who had already written his royal name on the relief.

Speculation in Egyptology during the 1960s and 1970s concerning the chronology and genealogy of the Twentieth Dynasty as well as uncertainties affecting the identity of the king shown on the "Procession of princes" relief led some scholars to propose that Ramesses VI was a grandson of Ramesses III and the son either of an unknown prince or of the infamous <a href="Pentawer">Pentawer</a> involved in the <a href="Harem%20conspiracy">murder of Ramesses III</a>. Such hypotheses have now been conclusively rejected and the relief is understood to mean exactly what it shows: that Ramesses VI was the son of Ramesses III. Ramesses VI's mother was probably <a href="Iset%20Ta-Hemdjert">Iset Ta-Hemdjert</a>, Ramesses III's <a href="Great%20Royal%20Wife">Great Royal Wife</a>, as suggested by the presence of Ramesses VI's cartouches on a door-jamb of <a href="Iset%20Ta-Hemdjert%23Tomb%20QV51">her tomb</a> in the <a href="Valley%20of%20the%20Queens">Valley of the Queens</a>.

Ramesses VI's Great Royal Wife was queen <a href="Nubkhesbed">Nubkhesbed</a>. The Egyptologists <a href="Aidan%20Dodson">Aidan Dodson</a> and Dyan Hilton believe that she bore Ramesses VI a total of four children: the princes <a href="Amenherkhepshef">Amenherkhepshef</a>, Panebenkemyt and Ramesses Itamun—the future pharaoh <a href="Ramesses%20VII">Ramesses VII</a> who succeeded his father for a short while on the throne—and princess <a href="Iset%20%28priestess%29">Iset</a> who was appointed to the priestly role of "<a href="Divine%20Adoratrice%20of%20Amun">Divine Adoratrice of Amun</a>". A <a href="stela">stela</a> recounting this appointment was discovered in <a href="Qift">Koptos</a> and demonstrates that Nubkhesbed was indeed Iset's mother.

Prince Amenherkhepshef died before his father and was buried in tomb <a href="KV13">KV13</a> in the Valley of the Kings, originally built for <a href="Bay%20%28chancellor%29">Chancellor Bay</a>, an important official of the late <a href="Nineteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Nineteenth Dynasty</a>. The tomb decoration was updated in consequence, some reliefs notably mentioning Nubkhesbed. Amenherkhepshef's sarcophagus was usurped from queen <a href="Twosret">Twosret</a>.

The filiation of Ramesses VII is established by an inscription on a doorjamb from Deir el-Medinaeh which reads "the good god, lord of the two lands, Usimaare-meryamun-setepenre, Son of Re, lord of epiphanies, Ramesses [VII], (It)-Amun, god, ruler of Heliopolis—he has made as his monument for his father, (may) live the good god, lord of the two lands, Nebmaare-meryamun, Son of Re, [Ramesses VI]".

The Egyptologists James Harris, <a href="Edward%20F.%20Wente">Edward F. Wente</a> and <a href="Kenneth%20Kitchen">Kenneth Kitchen</a> have also proposed, based on circumstantial evidence, that <a href="Ramesses%20IX">Ramesses IX</a> was a son of Ramesses VI and thus a brother to Ramesses VII. They note that Ramesses IX honoured Ramesses VII on two offering stands, suggesting that they were close kin. Ramesses IX named one of his sons Nebmaatre, which is Ramesses VI's prenomen, possibly as a means to honour his father. This hypothesis is contested by other scholars including Dodson and Hilton, who believe that Ramesses IX was instead a son of prince <a href="Montuherkhopshef%20%28son%20of%20Ramesses%20III%29">Montuherkhopshef</a> and thus a nephew to Ramesses VI. They base their conclusion on other circumstantial evidence: first is a depiction of Montuherkhopshef in <a href="KV19">KV19</a> on which Ramesses IX's prenomen had been added. Second is the fact that Ramesses IX's mother was named Takhat and Montuherkhopshef's spouse might have been a <a href="Takhat%20%2820th%20dynasty%29">lady</a> of the same name, hence possibly the same person.

The scholarly consensus is now that Ramesses VI reigned in the mid <a href="12th%20century%20BC">12th century BC</a> over a period of eight full years and lived for two months into his brief last regnal year. More precisely, the Egyptologist Steve Vinson proposed that he reigned between 1156 BC and 1149 BC, while the <a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a> reports 1145–1137 BC, <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20von%20Beckerath">Jürgen von Beckerath</a> gives 1142–1134 BC, <a href="Erik%20Hornung">Erik Hornung</a> 1145–1139 BC, <a href="Nicolas%20Grimal">Nicolas Grimal</a> 1144–1136 BC making him a contemporary of Nebuchadrezzar I of <a href="Isin">Isin</a>, <a href="Ian%20Shaw%20%28Egyptologist%29">Ian Shaw</a>, Jacobus van Dijk and Michael Rice 1143–1136 BC, and 1132–1125 BC in a 2017 study.

In 1977, the Egyptologists Wente and Charles van Siclen were the first to propose, upon reviewing the chronology of the New Kingdom period, that Ramesses VI lived into his eighth year of reign. This hypothesis was vindicated the next year by the Egyptologist Jac Janssen, who published an analysis of an <a href="ostracon">ostracon</a> which mentions the loan of an ox in the seventh and eighth years of an unnamed king who can only have been Ramesses VI. Two years later, Lanny Bell reported further evidence that Ramesses VI not only reigned into his eighth regnal year but most likely completed it and lived into his ninth.
Ramesses VI's eighth year on the throne may also be mentioned in Theban <a href="Graffito%20%28archaeology%29">graffito</a> 1860a, which names the then serving <a href="High%20Priest%20of%20Amun">High Priest of Amun</a>, <a href="Ramessesnakht">Ramessesnakht</a>. This graffito has also been ascribed to Ramesses X, but this interpretation has been contested and its ascription to Ramesses VI has been proposed as an alternative. The subject remains debated.
An important piece of evidence first recognised by Jansen in 1978 but fully exploited only five years later by the Egyptologist Raphael Ventura is found on the Turin Papyrus 1907+1908, which covers the time period from Ramesses VI's fifth year until Ramesses VII's seventh year on the throne.
The reconstruction of the document proposed by Ventura shows that the simplest solution available to explain the chronology of the period covered by the papyrus is that Ramesses VI enjoyed a reign of eight full years, died in his ninth, and was succeeded by Ramesses VII rather than <a href="Ramesses%20VIII">Ramesses VIII</a>, as had been debated until then.

Immediately after his accession to the throne, Ramesses VI and his court may have visited <a href="Thebes%2C%20Egypt">Thebes</a> on the occasion of the <a href="Beautiful%20Festival%20of%20the%20Valley">Beautiful Festival of the Valley</a> or the <a href="Opet%20Festival">Opet Festival</a>, concomitant with the preparations for Ramesses V's burial. Ramesses VI visited the city on at least another occasion during his reign, when he installed his daughter as Divine Adoratrice of Amun. The situation in the south of Egypt at the time of Ramesses VI's accession was not entirely stable, as attested by records showing that the workmen of <a href="Deir%20el-Bahari">Deir el-Bahari</a> could not work on the king's tomb owing to the presence of "the enemy" in the vicinity, a situation which occurred over a period of at least fifteen days during Ramesses VI's first year on the throne. This "enemy" was rumoured to have pillaged and burned the locality of Per-Nebyt and the chief of the <a href="Medjay">Medjay</a> of Thebes—essentially the police—ordered the workmen to remain idle and watch the king's tomb. It is unclear who these enemies were, the term could designate parties of <a href="Meshwesh">Libyan Meshwesh</a>, <a href="Libu">Libu</a> and Egyptian bandits, or as the Egyptologist <a href="Jaroslav%20%C4%8Cern%C3%BD%20%28Egyptologist%29">Jaroslav Černý</a> conjectured, a full blown civil war between followers of Ramesses V and Ramesses VI, a hypothesis supported by Rice but which has been strongly rejected by Kitchen and, to a lesser extend, by Grimal and van Dijk.
A short military campaign might have ensued and from Ramesses VI's second year on the throne onwards these troubles seem to have stopped. This campaign could be connected with an unusual statue of Ramesses VI showing him holding a bound Libyan captive, as well as with a depiction of Ramesses VI triumphing over foreign soldiers on the second pylon of the <a href="Karnak">Karnak temple</a>. This triumph scene was the last one to be made in Egypt until the later reigns of <a href="Siamun">Siamun</a> (986–967 BC) and <a href="Shoshenq%20I">Shoshenq I</a> (943–922 BC).

Other indications in favour of strife and military activities early in Ramesses VI's reign are the names he adopted upon ascending the throne, his Horus name meaning "Strong bull, great of victories, keeping alive the two lands" as well as his Nebty name "Powerful of arms, attacking the myriads".

Following these events, on his second year of rule, Ramesses VI finally buried Ramesses V in a yet unidentified tomb in the Valley of the Kings, having usurped the tomb originally prepared for his predecessor. On the occasion of this visit to Thebes, Ramesses VI installed his daughter Iset as <a href="God%27s%20Wife%20of%20Amun">God's Wife of Amun</a> and Divine Adoratice of Amun, in the presence of his mother, the acting <a href="Vizier%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">vizier</a> Nehy and other court officials. That same year, he ordered the reduction of the gang of workmen working on the king's tomb from 120 members to its former number of 60, which had been changed under Ramesses IV. Following this, the community of workers at Deir el-Medina went into gradual decline, the settlement being finally abandoned in the subsequent <a href="Twenty-first%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twenty-first Dynasty</a>.
In spite of the reduction, the Turin papyrus indicates that Ramesses VI ordered the construction of six tombs in the Valley of the Queens, a number which might include the hasty completion of the tomb of Iset Ta-Hemdjert, Ramesses' mother.
It is unknown whether these tombs were finished and in any case, they are now unidentifiable.
At some point in his reign, a cult statue of Ramesses VI was installed in a shrine of Ramesses II in the temple of Hathor of <a href="Deir%20el-Medina">Deir el-Medina</a>. The statue was called "Lord of the Two Lands, Nebmaatre Meryamun, Son of Re, Lord of Crowns, Ramesses Amunherkhepeshef Divine Ruler of <a href="Heliopolis%20%28ancient%20Egypt%29%23Names">Iunu</a>, Beloved like Amun".
A complete description of it is given on the verso of the <a href="Turin%20Papyrus%20Map">Turin Papyrus Map</a>, celebrated for being the oldest surviving topographical map. The papyrus indicates that the statue was made of two essences of painted wood and clay, showing pharaoh wearing a golden loincloth, a crown of <a href="lapis-lazuli">lapis-lazuli</a> and precious stones, a uraeus of gold and sandals of <a href="electrum">electrum</a>. The statue is said to receive three services of <a href="incense">incense</a> and libations everyday. The text of the papyrus is a letter directly addressed to Ramesses VI asking that a certain man be put in charge of the offerings. The letter seems to have been received favourably by the king, as the author's grandson is known to have held the title of "High Priest of Nebmaatre [Ramesses VI], Beloved of Amun".

Ramesses VI was apparently fond of such cult statues and no less than ten statues and a <a href="sphinx">sphinx</a> have been discovered in <a href="Tanis">Tanis</a>, <a href="Bubastis">Bubastis</a> and Karnak, more than any other Ramesside king of the Twentieth Dynasty following the reign of Ramesses III. The tomb of Penne, an Egyptian high-official in <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a> reports that Penne made a donation of lands to generate revenue towards the upkeep of yet another cult statue of Ramesses VI. Ramesses VI was so satisfied with this deed that he commanded his <a href="Viceroy%20of%20Kush">Viceroy of Kush</a> "Give the two silver vessels of ointment of gums, to the deputy [Penne]".

While few of Ramesses VI's activities are known in details, he is well attested by numerous reliefs, inscriptions, statues and minor finds from Karnak, Koptos and <a href="Heliopolis%2C%20Egypt">Heliopolis</a>.

Over the period spanning the reigns of Ramesses VI, VII and VIII, prices of basic commodities, in particular grain, rose sharply.
With Egypt's economy getting weaker, Ramesses VI turned to usurping the statues and monuments of his forebears, frequently plastering and then carving his cartouches over theirs, in particular those of Ramesses IV which figured prominently along the processional routes in Karnak and Luxor. In other examples, he usurped a statue of Ramesses IV, columns of texts inscribed by Ramesses IV on an obelisk of <a href="Thutmose%20I">Thutmose I</a> in Karnak, and the tomb of Ramesses V. Kitchen warns not to over-interpret these usurpations as signs of antagonism on behalf of Ramesses VI with respect to his older brother and nephew. The usurpations were not thorough but were rather targeted to the most prominent places, where Ramesses VI's cartouches would be most visible. Besides, Ramesses VI did leave cartouches of Ramesses IV intact in many places, including in places where both his name and that of his brother feature close to one another such as in the Medinet Habu temple of Ramesses III, so that the hypothesis of a <a href="damnatio%20memoriae">damnatio memoriae</a>—whereby all references to someone are systematically eliminated so as to remove this person from memory and history—can be eliminated.

A possible evidence for genuine architectural works on Ramesses VI's behalf is found in <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphis</a>, where an inscription on a granite gateway cornice of the <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt%23Great%20Temple%20of%20Ptah">temple of Ptah</a> claims that he erected a great pylon of fine stone. Ramesses VI then boasts of "covering all the land with great monuments in my name [...] built in honour of my fathers the gods".
Overall, the Egyptologist Amin Amer characterises Ramesses VI as "a king who wished to pose as a great pharaoh in an age of unrest and decline".

Some high officials of Ramesses VI are known, such as his finance minister and overseer of the treasury Montuemtawy who was in office since the end of Ramesses III's reign; the vizier Neferronpe in office since Ramesses IV's time on the throne; his son the vizier Nehy; Amenmose the mayor of Thebes and the king's butler Qedren. To the south, the troop commander of Kush was Nebmarenakhte and the administrator of Wawat—the land between the first and second cataracts of the Nile—mayor of <a href="Aniba%20%28Nubia%29">Anîba</a> and controller of the <a href="Temple%20of%20Derr">Temple of Horus at Derr</a> was Penne.

In Thebes, the high-priesthood came under the control of Ramessesnakht and his family at the time of Ramesses IV, possibly owing to Ramessesnakht's father Merybaste's high control over the country's financial institutions. Ramessesnakht was officially Ramesses VI's Vizier of the South and his power grew at the expense of that of the pharaoh in spite of the fact that Iset was connected to the Amun priesthood as well "in her role as God's Wife of Amun or Divine Adoratice". If fact, Ramessesnakht most likely oversaw the construction of the funerary building of Iset in the tomb
complex K93.12, and while, as the Egyptologist Daniel Polz puts it, "he and his relatives were the most powerful individuals in Egypt at the end of the Twentieth Dynasty", his activities were not directed against royal interests. Ramessesnakht often attended the distribution of supplies to workmen and controlled much of the activity connected with the construction of the king's tomb, possibly because the treasury of the high-priest of Amun was now at least partially funding these works. Ramessesnakht's son Usermarenakhte was made into the Steward of Amun and became administrator of large swaths of land in Middle Egypt. He also inherited the role of Merybaste as controller of the country's taxes, ensuring that Ramessesnakht's family was in full control of both the royal treasury and the treasury of Amun. Further high offices such as those of the second and third priests and of "god's father of Amun" were given to people who entered Ramesesnakht's family by marriage.

Ramessesnakht was powerful enough to build for himself one of the largest funerary establishments of the entire Theban necropolis at the end of the New Kingdom, when royal building projects including Ramesses VI's usurped mortuary temple had been abandoned. Ramessesnakht's monument, in <a href="Dra%27%20Abu%20el-Naga%27">Dra' Abu el-Naga'</a>, reused an earlier building dating back to the <a href="Seventeenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Seventeenth</a> or <a href="Eighteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Eighteenth Dynasty</a> and was refurbished to show the political and economic standing of its owner. Overall, Egyptologists now estimate that Ramessesnakht and his dynasty essentially established a second centre of power in <a href="Upper%20Egypt">Upper Egypt</a>, seemingly on the behalf of the Twentieth Dynasty kings who ruled from Memphis and <a href="Pi-Ramesses">Pi-Ramesses</a> in <a href="Lower%20Egypt">Lower Egypt</a>. This effectively made Thebes into the religious capital of Egypt as well as an administrative one on a par with its northern counterpart, laying the foundations for the rise of the Twenty-first Dynasty under <a href="Herihor">Herihor</a> and <a href="Pinedjem%20I">Pinedjem I</a>, 50 to 70 years later.

Egypt's political and economic decline continued unabated during Ramesses VI's reign. He is the last king of the New Kingdom period whose name is attested on inscribed wall fragments as well as two pillars of the temple of Hathor of the <a href="Serabit%20el-Khadim">Serabit el-Khadim</a> in <a href="Sinai">Sinai</a>, where he sent expeditions to mine copper ore.

Egypt may nonetheless still have wielded some sort of influence or at least still had some connections with the remnants of its empire in the Levant, as suggested by the base of a fragmented bronze statue of Ramesses VI discovered in <a href="Tel%20Megiddo">Megiddo</a> in <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>, and a <a href="Scarab%20%28artifact%29">scarab</a> of his from <a href="Alalakh">Alalakh</a> on the coast in southern <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>.

Egyptian presence in Canaan was terminated during or soon after Ramesses VI's rule, with the last garrisons leaving southern and western Palestine around the time, and the frontier between Egypt and abroad returning to a fortified line joining the Mediterranean to the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>. A 2017 archaeological study reached the same conclusion, namely that Ramesses VI's reign is the <a href="terminus%20post%20quem">terminus post quem</a> for the presence of the Egyptian military in <a href="Jaffa">Jaffa</a>, which was twice destroyed around this time period. Opponents of the Egyptian authority were of local extraction, probably originating in Canaanite cities of the Levantine coastal plain, an opposition to Egyptian hegemony ultimately resulting from the arrival of the <a href="Sea%20People">Sea People</a> in the region during the reign of Ramesses III. The loss of all Asiatic territories further strained the redistributive economy of Egypt's New Kingdom society, depriving the subsequent kings of much of their legitimacy.

The Egyptian control of Nubia seems to have been much firmer at the time, owing either to the advanced Egyptianisation of the local population or to the economic importance of this region. Ramesses VI's cartouches have been uncovered on <a href="Sehel%20Island">Sehel Island</a> near <a href="Aswan">Aswan</a> and in Ramesses II's temple in <a href="Wadi%20es-Sebua">Wadi es-Sebua</a>. Ramesses VI is mentioned in the tomb of Penne in Anîba, not far from the <a href="Cataracts%20of%20the%20Nile">Third Cataract of the Nile</a>. Penne also recounts punitive military raids further south, from which he claims to have brought back loot to pharaoh.

Ramesses VI was buried in the <a href="Valley%20of%20the%20Kings">Valley of the Kings</a>, in a tomb now known as <a href="KV9">KV9</a>. The tomb was first built for Ramesses V, who may have been buried in it for the short period of time necessary for another, likely undecorated tomb, to be cut for him somewhere else in the Valley of Kings and which remains to be discovered. In any case, Ramesses VI commanded that KV9 be entirely refurbished for himself with no space left for Ramesses V's permanent burial, who was finally led to rest in Ramesses VI's second year on the throne, possibly because stability had returned to Thebes at the time. The usurpation of Ramesses V's tomb may be a sign that Ramesses VI did not hold his predecessor in high regard, which would explain why he had Ramesses V's name obliterated and replaced by his own on more than one occasion. Alternatively it may reflect the king's pragmatic concern for economical measures.
The renewed works on KV9 are responsible for the preservation of that of <a href="Tutankhamun">Tutankhamun</a>, the entrance of which was buried beneath huts built for the craftsmen working on Ramesses VI's tomb. These works seem to have been completed during Ramesses VI's sixth year of reign, at which point Ramessesnakht received 600 <a href="Deben%20%28unit%29">debens</a> of blunted copper tools in the great forecourt of Amun in Karnak, probably indicating the end of the construction works on the tomb. Furthermore, if the Theban ostracon 1860a does refer to Ramesses VI and not Ramesses X, then it indicates that the tomb was finally ready for the king in his eighth year on the throne, at which point he might have been ill and nearing death. Once finished, the tomb was -long and included one of only three complete renditions of the <a href="Book%20of%20Gates">Book of Gates</a> known from royal funerary context, as well as a complete version of the <a href="Book%20of%20Caverns">Book of Caverns</a>.

Within 20 years of Ramesses VI's burial, the tomb was most probably desecrated and ransacked by grave robbers, who hacked away at the hands and feet of Ramesses' mummy to gain access to his jewelry. These events, occurring during the reign of <a href="Ramesses%20XI">Ramesses XI</a>, are described in the <a href="Mayer%20Papyri%23Papyrus%20Mayer%20B">Papyrus Mayer B</a> although the identification of the tomb mentioned in this source is not entirely certain. Ramesses VI's mummy was subsequently moved to the tomb <a href="KV35">KV35</a> of <a href="Amenhotep%20II">Amenhotep II</a> during the reign of Pinedjem of the early Twenty-First Dynasty, where it was discovered in 1898 by <a href="Victor%20Loret">Victor Loret</a>.
A medical examination of the mummy revealed that Ramesses VI died aged around forty, and showed severe damage to his body, the head and torso being broken into several pieces by an axe used by the tomb robbers.

In 1898, <a href="Georges%20%C3%89mile%20Jules%20Daressy">Georges Émile Jules Daressy</a> cleared KV9, which had remained opened since antiquity, uncovering fragments of a large granite box as well as numerous pieces of Ramesses VI's <a href="wikt%3Amummiform">mummiform</a> stone sarcophagus, the face of which is now in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>. The sarcophagus was restored in 2004 following two years of work on over 250 fragments recovered in the tomb, where it is now on display. <a href="Zahi%20Hawass">Zahi Hawass</a>, then head of Egypt's <a href="Supreme%20Council%20of%20Antiquities">Supreme Council of Antiquities</a>, unsuccessfully requested the return of the sarcophagus' face from the British Museum to Egypt.

Ramesses VI seems to have usurped the large <a href="mortuary%20temple">mortuary temple</a> in <a href="El-Assasif">El-Assasif</a> from Ramesses V, who had himself likely taken it from his father Ramesses IV. The temple was planned to be nearly half the size of that of Medinet Habu and was only in its foundation stages at the death of Ramesses IV. It is unclear whether it was ever completed, but the temple is mentioned as a land-owning institution in the <a href="Wilbour%20Papyrus">Wilbour Papyrus</a> dating to Ramesses V's reign. Archaeological excavations show much of its surviving decoration was made under Ramesses VI.
