Ico

The protagonist is a young boy named Ico who was born with horns, which his village considers a bad omen. Warriors lock him away in an abandoned fortress. During his explorations of the fortress, Ico encounters Yorda, the daughter of the castle's Queen. The Queen plans to use Yorda's body to extend her own lifespan. Learning this, Ico seeks to escape the castle with Yorda, keeping her safe from the shadow-like creatures that attempt to draw her back. Throughout the game, the player controls Ico as he explores the castle, solves puzzles and assists Yorda across obstacles.

"Ico" introduced several design and technical elements, including a story told with minimal dialogue, <a href="bloom%20%28shader%20effect%29">bloom lighting</a>, and <a href="key%20frame">key frame</a> animation, that have influenced subsequent games. Although not a commercial success, it was critically acclaimed for its art, original gameplay and story elements and received several awards, including "Game of the Year" nominations and three <a href="Game%20Developers%20Choice%20Awards">Game Developers Choice Awards</a>. Considered a <a href="List%20of%20cult%20video%20games">cult classic</a>, it has been called one of the <a href="greatest%20games%20of%20all%20time">greatest games of all time</a>, and is often brought up in discussions about <a href="video%20games%20as%20an%20art%20form">video games as an art form</a>. It was rereleased in Europe in 2006 in conjunction with "<a href="Shadow%20of%20the%20Colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>", the <a href="spiritual%20successor">spiritual successor</a> to "Ico".

"Ico" is primarily a <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional</a> <a href="platform%20game">platform game</a>. The player controls Ico from a <a href="Third-person%20view">third-person perspective</a> as he explores the castle and attempts to escape it with Yorda. The camera is fixed in each room or area but swivels to follow Ico or Yorda as they move; the player can also <a href="Panning%20%28camera%29">pan</a> the view a small degree in other directions to observe more of the surroundings. The game includes many elements of platform games; for example, the player must have Ico jump, climb, push and pull objects, and perform other tasks such as solving puzzles in order to progress within the castle. 

These actions are complicated by the fact that only Ico can carry out these actions; Yorda can only jump short distances and cannot climb over tall barriers. The player must use Ico so that he helps Yorda cross obstacles, such as by lifting her to a higher ledge, or by arranging the environment to allow Yorda to cross a larger gap herself. The player can tell Yorda to follow Ico, or to wait at a spot. The player can also have Ico take Yorda's hand and pull her along at a faster pace across the environment. Players are unable to progress in the game until they move Yorda to certain doors that only she can open.

Escaping the castle is made difficult by shadow creatures sent by the Queen. These creatures attempt to drag Yorda into black vortexes if Ico leaves her for any length of time, or if she is in certain areas of the castle. Ico can dispel these shadows using a stick or sword and pull Yorda free if she is drawn into a vortex. While the shadow creatures cannot harm Ico, the game is over if Yorda becomes fully engulfed in a vortex; the player restarts from a <a href="Save-state">save point</a>. The player will also restart from a save point if Ico falls from a large height. Save points in the game are represented by stone benches that Ico and Yorda rest on as the player saves the game. In European and Japanese releases of the game, upon completion of the game, the player has the opportunity to restart the game in a local co-operative two-player mode, where the second player plays as Yorda, still under the same limitations as the computer-controlled version of the character.
, a horned boy, is taken by a group of warriors to an abandoned castle and locked inside a <a href="sarcophagus">stone coffin</a> to be sacrificed. A tremor topples the coffin and Ico escapes. As he searches the castle, he comes across , a captive girl who speaks a different language. Ico helps Yorda escape and defends her from shadow-like creatures. The pair makes their way through the castle and arrive at the bridge leading to land. As they cross, the Queen, ruler of the castle, appears and tells Yorda that as her daughter she cannot leave the castle. Later, as they try to escape on the bridge, it slips up and they get separated. Yorda tries to save Ico but the Queen prevents it. He ends up falling off the bridge and losing consciousness.

Ico awakens below the castle and makes his way back to the upper levels, finding a magic sword that dispels the shadow creatures. After discovering that Yorda has been <a href="Petrifaction%20in%20mythology%20and%20fiction">turned to stone</a> by the Queen, he confronts the Queen in her throne room, who reveals that she plans to restart her life anew by taking possession of Yorda's body. Ico slays the Queen with the magic sword, but his horns are broken in the fight and at the end of it he is knocked unconscious. With the Queen's death the castle begins to collapse around Ico, but the Queen's spell on Yorda is broken, and a shadowy Yorda carries Ico safely out of the castle to a boat, sending him to drift to the shore alone. Ico awakens to find the distant castle in ruins, and Yorda, in her human form, washed up nearby. She wakes up and smiles at Ico.

Lead designer Fumito Ueda came up with the concept for "Ico" in 1997, envisioning a "boy meets girl" story where the two main characters would hold hands during their adventure, forming a bond between them without communication. Ueda's original inspiration for "Ico" was a TV commercial he saw, of a woman holding the hand of a child while walking through the woods, and the <a href="manga">manga</a> series "<a href="Galaxy%20Express%20999">Galaxy Express 999</a>" (1977–1981), where a woman is a guardian for the young hero as they adventure through the galaxy, which he thought about adapting into a new idea for video games. He also cited his work as an animator on <a href="Kenji%20Eno">Kenji Eno</a>'s <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a> game "<a href="Enemy%20Zero">Enemy Zero</a>", which influenced the animation work, <a href="Cutaway%20%28filmmaking%29">cinematic</a> <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s, lighting effects, sound design, and mature appeal. Ueda was also inspired by the video game "<a href="Another%20World%20%28video%20game%29">Another World</a>" ("Outer World" in Japan), which used cinematic cutscenes, lacked any <a href="head-up%20display">head-up display</a> elements as to play like a movie, and also featured an emotional connection between two characters despite the use of minimal dialog. He also cited <a href="Sega%20Mega%20Drive">Sega Mega Drive</a> games, "<a href="Virtua%20Fighter">Virtua Fighter</a>", "<a href="Lemmings%20%28video%20game%29">Lemmings</a>", "<a href="Flashback%20%281992%20video%20game%29">Flashback</a>" and the original "<a href="Prince%20of%20Persia">Prince of Persia</a>" games as influences, specifically regarding animation and gameplay style. With the help of an assistant, Ueda created an animation in <a href="Lightwave">Lightwave</a> to get a feel for the final game and to better convey his vision. In the three-minute demonstration reel, Yorda had the horns instead of Ico, and flying robotic creatures were seen firing weapons to destroy the castle. Ueda stated that having this movie that represented his vision helped to keep the team on track for the long development process, and he reused this technique for the development of "<a href="Shadow%20of%20the%20Colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>", the team's next effort.

Ueda began working with producer <a href="Kenji%20Kaido">Kenji Kaido</a> in 1998 to develop the idea and bring the game to the <a href="PlayStation">PlayStation</a>. "Ico"s design aesthetics were guided by three key notions: to make a game that would be different from others in the genre, feature an aesthetic style that would be consistently artistic, and play out in an imaginary yet realistic setting. This was achieved through the use of "subtracting design"; they removed elements from the game which interfered with the game's reality. This included removing any form of interface elements, keeping the gameplay focused only on the escape from the castle, and reducing the number of types of enemies in the game to a single foe. An interim design of the game shows Ico and Yorda facing horned warriors similar to those that take Ico to the castle. The game originally focused on Ico's attempt to return Yorda to her room in the castle after she was kidnapped by these warriors. Ueda believed this version had too much detail for the graphics engine they had developed, and as part of the "subtracting design", replaced the warriors with the shadow creatures. Ueda also brought in a number of people outside the video game industry to help with development. These consisted of two programmers, four artists, and one designer in addition to Ueda and Kaido, forming the base of what is now known as <a href="Team%20Ico">Team Ico</a>. On reflection, Ueda noted that the subtracting design may have taken too much out of the game, and did not go to as great an extreme with "Shadow of the Colossus".

After two years of development, the team ran into limitations on the PlayStation hardware and faced a critical choice: either terminate the project altogether, alter their vision to fit the constraints of the hardware, or continue to explore more options. The team decided to remain true to Ueda's vision, and began to use the <a href="Emotion%20Engine">Emotion Engine</a> of the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>, taking advantage of the improved abilities of the platform. Character animation was accomplished through <a href="key%20frame">key frame</a> animation instead of the more common <a href="motion%20capture">motion capture</a> technique. The game took about four years to create. Ueda purposely left the ending vague, not stating whether Yorda was alive, whether she would travel with Ico, or if it was simply the protagonist's dream.

The cover used for releases in Japan and <a href="PAL%20region">PAL region</a>s was drawn by Ueda himself, and was inspired by the <a href="Italian%20people">Italian</a> artist <a href="Giorgio%20de%20Chirico">Giorgio de Chirico</a> and his work "<a href="The%20Nostalgia%20of%20the%20Infinite">The Nostalgia of the Infinite</a>". Ueda believed that "the surrealistic world of de Chirico matched the allegoric world of Ico". The North American version lacks this cover as well as additional features that become available after the player completes the game once. The development team was unable to provide Ueda's cover or the additional features such as the two-player mode in time for Sony's planned North American release date, but included them for the later releases in Japan and PAL regions. On reflection, Yasuhide Kobayashi, vice-president of Sony's Japan Studio, believed the North American box art and lack of an identifiable English title led to the game's poor sales in the United States, and stated plans to correct that for the release of "<a href="The%20Last%20Guardian">The Last Guardian</a>". For its original release, a limited edition of the game was available in PAL regions that included a cardboard wrapping displaying artwork from the game and four art cards inside the box. The game was re-released as a standard edition in 2006 across all PAL regions except France after the 2005 release of "Shadow of the Colossus", "Ico"s <a href="spiritual%20sequel">spiritual sequel</a>, to allow players to "fill the gap in their collection".

"Ico" uses minimal dialog in a fictional language to provide the story throughout the game. Voice actors included Kazuhiro Shindō as Ico, <a href="Rieko%20Takahashi">Rieko Takahashi</a> as Yorda, and <a href="Misa%20Watanabe">Misa Watanabe</a> as the Queen. Ico and the Queen's words are presented in either English or Japanese subtitles depending on the release region, but Yorda's speech is presented in a symbolic language. Ueda opted not to provide the translation for Yorda's words as it would have overcome the language barrier between Ico and Yorda, and detracted from the "holding hands" concept of the game. In the non-North American releases, playing through the game again after completing the game replaces the symbolic text with appropriate language subtitles.

"Ico"s audio featured a limited amount of music and sound effects. The <a href="soundtrack">soundtrack</a>, , was composed by <a href="Michiru%20Oshima">Michiru Oshima</a> and sound unit "pentagon" (Koichi Yamazaki & Mitsukuni Murayama) and released in Japan by <a href="Sony%20Music%20Entertainment">Sony Music Entertainment</a> on February 20, 2002. The album was distributed by Sony Music Entertainment Visual Works. The last song of the CD, "ICO -You Were There-", includes vocals sung by former <a href="Libera%20%28choir%29">Libera</a> member Steven Geraghty.
A <a href="novelization">novelization</a> of the game titled was released in <a href="Japan">Japan</a> in 2004. Author <a href="Miyuki%20Miyabe">Miyuki Miyabe</a> wrote the novel because of her appreciation of the game. A Korean translation of the novel, entitled 이코 - 안개의 성 ("I-ko: An-gae-eui Seong") came out the following year, by Hwangmae Publishers, while an English translation was published by <a href="Viz%20Media">Viz Media</a> on August 16 of 2011.

Costumes (including Ico and Yorda), stickers, and sound effects from "Ico" are part of an add-on pack for the game "<a href="LittleBigPlanet">LittleBigPlanet</a>", alongside similar materials from "Shadow of the Colossus", after being teased by the game's developers <a href="Media%20Molecule">Media Molecule</a> about two weeks prior.

A film adaption of "Ico" may come about based on the success of the adaptation of "Shadow of the Colossus" being created by <a href="Kevin%20Misher">Misher Films</a> in conjunction with Sony and Fumito Ueda.

"Ico" received strong <a href="game%20critic">reviews</a>, becoming a <a href="cult%20following">cult</a> hit among <a href="video%20game%20player">players</a>. The game has an aggregated review score of 90 out of 100 at <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. In Japan, "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>" magazine scored the PlayStation 2 version of the game a 30 out of 40. The game is considered by some to be one of the greatest games of all time; "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" ranked "Ico" as the 13th top game in a 2007 listing, while <a href="IGN">IGN</a> ranked the game at number 18 in 2005, and at number 57 in 2007. "Ico" has been used as an example of a <a href="Video%20games%20as%20art">game that is a work of art</a>. Ueda commented that he purposely tried to distance "Ico" from conventional video games due to the negative image that video games were receiving at that time, in order to draw more people to the title.

Some reviewers have likened "Ico" to older, simpler adventure games such as "<a href="Prince%20of%20Persia">Prince of Persia</a>" or "<a href="Tomb%20Raider">Tomb Raider</a>", that seek to evoke an emotional experience from the player; <a href="IGN">IGN</a>s David Smith commented that while simple, as an experience the game was "near indescribable." The game's graphics and sound contributed strongly to the positive reactions from critics; Smith continues that "The visuals, sound, and original puzzle design come together to make something that is almost, if not quite, completely unlike anything else on the market, and feels wonderful because of it." Many reviewers were impressed with the expansiveness and the details given to the environments, the animation used for the main characters despite their low polygon count, as well as the use of lighting effects. "Ico"s ambiance, created by the simple music and the small attention to detail in the voice work of the main characters, were also called out as strong points for the game. <a href="Charles%20Herold">Charles Herold</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" summed up his review stating that "Ico is not a perfect game, but it is a game of perfect moments." Herold later commented that "Ico" breaks the mold of games that usually involve companions. In most games these companions are invulnerable and players will generally not concern with the non-playable characters' fate, but "Ico" creates the sense of "trust and childish fragility" around Yorda, and that these leads to the character being "the game's entire focus".

The game is noted for its simple combat system that would "disappoint those craving sheer mechanical depth", as stated by <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>s Miguel Lopez. The game's puzzle design has been praised for creating a rewarding experience for players who work through challenges on their own; Kristen Reed of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>, for example, said that "you quietly, logically, willingly proceed, and the illusion is perfect: the game never tells you what to do, even though the game is always telling you what to do". "Ico" is also considered a short game, taking between seven and ten hours for a single play through, which <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a> calls "painfully short" with "no replay outside of self-imposed challenges". <a href="G4%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">G4TV</a>'s Matthew Keil, however, felt that "the game is so strong, many will finish 'Ico' in one or two sittings". The lack of features in the North American release, which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game, was said to reduce the replay value of the title. "Electronic Gaming Monthly" notes that "Yorda would probably be the worst companion -she's scatterbrained and helpless; if not for the fact that the player develops a bond with her, making the game's ending all the more heartrending."

Despite the positive praise, the original title did not sell well. By 2009, only 700,000 copies were sold worldwide, with 270,000 in the United States. and the bulk in PAL regions, Ueda considered his design by subtraction approach may have hurt the marketing of the game, as at the time of the game's release, promotion of video games were primarily done through screenshots, and as "Ico" lacked any heads-up display, it appeared uninteresting to potential buyers.

"Ico" received several acclamations from the video game press, and was considered to be one of the Games of the Year by many publications, despite competing with releases such as "<a href="Halo%20%28video%20game%29">Halo</a>", "", and "<a href="Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III">Grand Theft Auto III</a>". The game received three <a href="Game%20Developers%20Choice%20Awards">Game Developers Choice Awards</a> in 2002, including "Excellence in Level Design", "Excellence in Visual Arts", and "Game Innovation Spotlight". The game won two <a href="Interactive%20Achievement%20Awards">Interactive Achievement Awards</a> from the <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a> in 2002 for "Art Direction" and "Character or Story Development", and was nominated for awards of "Game of the Year", "Game Design", "Level Design" and "Sound Design".

"Ico" is stated by Chris Kohler of "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>" to have influenced numerous other video games, borrowing from its simple and visual design ideals. Several game designers, such as <a href="Eiji%20Aonuma">Eiji Aonuma</a>, <a href="Hideo%20Kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>, and <a href="Jordan%20Mechner">Jordan Mechner</a>, have cited "Ico" as having influenced the visual appearance of their games, including "", "", and "", respectively. <a href="Marc%20Laidlaw">Marc Laidlaw</a>, <a href="Screenwriter">scriptwriter</a> for the <a href="Half-Life%20series">"Half-Life" series</a>, commented that, among several other more memorable moments in the game, the point where Yorda attempts to save Ico from falling off the damaged bridge was "a significant event not only for that game, but for the art of game design". The <a href="Naughty%20Dog">Naughty Dog</a> team used "Ico" as part of the inspiration for developing "<a href="Uncharted%203">Uncharted 3</a>". Vander Caballero credits "Ico" for inspiring the gameplay of "<a href="Papo%20%26amp%3B%20Yo">Papo & Yo</a>". Phil Fish used the design by subtraction approach in developing the title "<a href="Fez%20%28video%20game%29">Fez</a>". The developers of both "" and "<a href="Rime%20%28video%20game%29">Rime</a>" have "Ico" as a core influence on their design. <a href="Hidetaka%20Miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a>, creator and director of the "<a href="Souls%20%28series%29">Souls</a>" series, cited "Ico" as a key influence to him becoming involved in developing video games, stating that "Ico" "awoke me to the possibilities of the medium".

Film director <a href="Guillermo%20del%20Toro">Guillermo del Toro</a> cited both "Ico" and "Shadow of the Colossus" as "masterpieces" and part of his directorial influence. <a href="Jonny%20Greenwood">Jonny Greenwood</a> of <a href="Radiohead">Radiohead</a> considers, of his top ten video games, ""Ico" might be the best one".

, released for the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> in October 2005 in Japan and North America, was developed by the same team that developed "Ico". The game features similar graphics, gameplay, and storytelling elements as "Ico". The game was referred by its working title "Nico" ("Ni" being Japanese for the number 2") until the final title was revealed. Ueda, when asked about the connection between the two games, stated that "Shadow of the Colossus" is a <a href="prequel">prequel</a> to "Ico".

Team Ico's third game, "<a href="The%20Last%20Guardian">The Last Guardian</a>", was announced as a <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> title at the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%202009">Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009</a>. The game centers on the connection between a young boy and a large <a href="griffin">griffin</a>-like creature that he befriends, requiring the player to cooperate with the creature to solve the game's puzzles. The game fell into <a href="development%20hell">development hell</a> due to hardware limitations and the departure of Ueda from Sony around 2012, along with other Team Ico members, though Ueda and the other members continued to work on the game via consulting contracts. Development subsequently switched to the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> in 2012, and the game was reannounced in 2015 and released in December 2016. Ueda has stated that "the essence of the game is rather close to "Ico"".

"Ico", along with "Shadow of the Colossus", received a high-definition remaster for the PlayStation 3 that was released worldwide in September 2011. In addition to improved graphics, the games were updated to include support for <a href="Stereoscopy">stereoscopic 3D</a> and PlayStation Trophies. The "Ico" port was also based on the European version, and includes features such as Yorda's translation and the two-player mode. In North America and Europe/PAL regions, the two games were released as a single retail collection, while in Japan, they were released as separate titles. Both games have since been released separately as downloadable titles on the PlayStation Network store. Patch 1.01 for the digital high-definition Ico version added the <a href="Remote%20Play">Remote Play</a> feature, allowing the game to be played on the <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a>.

Covent Garden

Covent Garden () is a district in <a href="Greater%20London">Greater London</a>, on the eastern fringes of the <a href="West%20End%20of%20London">West End</a>, between <a href="Charing%20Cross%20Road">Charing Cross Road</a> and <a href="Drury%20Lane">Drury Lane</a>. It is associated with the former fruit-and-vegetable market in the central square, now a popular shopping and tourist site, and with the <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Royal Opera House</a>, which is also known as "Covent Garden". The district is divided by the main thoroughfare of <a href="Long%20Acre">Long Acre</a>, north of which is given over to independent shops centred on <a href="Neal%27s%20Yard">Neal's Yard</a> and <a href="Seven%20Dials%2C%20London">Seven Dials</a>, while the south contains the central square with its street performers and most of the historical buildings, theatres and entertainment facilities, including the <a href="London%20Transport%20Museum">London Transport Museum</a> and the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a>.

The area was briefly settled in the 7th century when it became the heart of the Anglo-Saxon trading town of <a href="Lundenwic">Lundenwic</a>, abandoned at the end of the 9th century. By 1200, part of it had been walled off by <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> for use as <a href="arable%20land">arable land</a> and orchards. Referred to as "the garden of the Abbey and Convent", and later "the Covent Garden", it was seized by <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> and granted to the <a href="Earl%20of%20Bedford">Earls of Bedford</a> in 1552. The <a href="Francis%20Russell%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Bedford">4th Earl</a> commissioned <a href="Inigo%20Jones">Inigo Jones</a> to build some fine houses to attract wealthy tenants. Jones designed the <a href="Italianate">Italianate</a> arcaded square along with the church of <a href="St%20Paul%27s%2C%20Covent%20Garden">St Paul's</a>. The design of the square was new to London and had a significant influence on modern town planning, acting as the prototype for new estates as London grew.

By 1654 a small open-air fruit-and-vegetable market had developed on the south side of the fashionable square. Gradually, both the market and the surrounding area fell into disrepute, as taverns, theatres, coffee-houses and brothels opened up. By the 18th century it had become a well-known <a href="red-light%20district">red-light district</a>. An Act of Parliament was drawn up to control the area, and <a href="Charles%20Fowler">Charles Fowler</a>'s neo-classical building was erected in 1830 to cover and help organise the market. The market grew and further buildings were added: the Floral Hall, Charter Market, and in 1904 the Jubilee Market. By the end of the 1960s traffic congestion was causing problems, and in 1974 the market relocated to the <a href="New%20Covent%20Garden%20Market">New Covent Garden Market</a> about three miles (5 km) south-west at <a href="Nine%20Elms">Nine Elms</a>. The central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980 and is now a tourist location containing cafes, pubs, small shops, and a craft market called the Apple Market, along with another market held in the Jubilee Hall.

Covent Garden falls within the London boroughs of <a href="City%20of%20Westminster">Westminster</a> and <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Camden">Camden</a> and the parliamentary constituencies of <a href="Cities%20of%20London%20and%20Westminster%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Cities of London and Westminster</a> and <a href="Holborn%20and%20St%20Pancras%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Holborn and St Pancras</a>. The area has been served by the <a href="Piccadilly%20line">Piccadilly line</a> at <a href="Covent%20Garden%20tube%20station">Covent Garden Underground station</a> since 1907.

What would become <a href="Strand%2C%20London">the Strand</a> on the southern boundary of the future Covent Garden was used during the <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman period</a> as part of a route to <a href="Silchester">Silchester</a>, known as "Iter VII" on the <a href="Antonine%20Itinerary">Antonine Itinerary</a>. Excavations in 2006 at <a href="St%20Martin-in-the-Fields">St Martin-in-the-Fields</a> revealed a late Roman grave, suggesting the locale had been a sacred site. The area to the north of the Strand was long thought to have remained as unsettled fields until the 16th century, but theories by <a href="Alan%20Vince">Alan Vince</a> and <a href="Martin%20Biddle">Martin Biddle</a> that there had been an <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> settlement to the west of the old Roman town of <a href="Londinium">Londinium</a> were borne out by excavations in 1985 and 2005. These revealed Covent Garden as the centre of a trading town called Lundenwic, developed around 600 AD, which stretched from <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a> to <a href="Aldwych">Aldwych</a>. <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a> gradually shifted the settlement into the old Roman town of Londinium from around 886 AD onwards, leaving no mark of the old town, and the site returned to fields.

A document from 1200 AD mentions a walled garden owned by the <a href="Benedictine%20monk">Benedictine monk</a>s of the <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Abbey of St Peter, Westminster</a>. A later document, dated between 1250 and 1283, refers to "the garden of the Abbot and Convent of Westminster". By the 13th century this had become a quadrangle of mixed orchard, meadow, pasture and arable land, lying between modern-day <a href="St%20Martin%27s%20Lane">St Martin's Lane</a> and Drury Lane, and <a href="Floral%20Street">Floral Street</a> and <a href="Maiden%20Lane%2C%20Covent%20Garden">Maiden Lane</a>. The use of the name "Covent"—an Anglo-French term for a religious community, equivalent to "monastery" or "convent"—appears in a document in 1515, when the Abbey, which had been letting out parcels of land along the north side of the Strand for inns and market gardens, granted a lease of the walled garden, referring to it as "a garden called Covent Garden". This is how it was recorded from then on.

After the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a> in 1540, Henry VIII took the land belonging to Westminster Abbey for himself; this included the convent garden and seven acres to the north called Long Acre. His son, <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI</a>, granted it to the <a href="John%20Russell%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Bedford">John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford</a>, in 1552. The Russell family, who in 1694 were advanced in their <a href="peerage">peerage</a> from Earl to <a href="Duke%20of%20Bedford">Duke of Bedford</a>, held the land until 1918.

Russell built Bedford House and garden on part of the land, with an entrance on the Strand, the large garden stretching back along the south side of the old walled-off convent garden. In 1630, 4th Earl of Bedford, Francis Russell commissioned Inigo Jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around a large square or piazza. This had been prompted by <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> taking offence at the condition of the road and houses along Long Acre, which were the responsibility of Russell and <a href="Henry%20Carey%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Monmouth">Henry Carey, 2nd Earl of Monmouth</a>. Russell and Carey complained that under the 1625 Proclamation concerning Buildings, which restricted building in and around London, they could not build new houses. For a fee of £2,000, the King then granted Russell a licence to build as many new houses on his land as he "shall thinke fitt and convenient".
The houses initially attracted the wealthy, though they moved out when a market developed on the south side of the square around 1654, and coffee houses, taverns, and prostitutes moved in. The Bedford Estate was expanded in 1669 to include <a href="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a>, when <a href="William%20Russell%2C%20Lord%20Russell">Lord Russell</a> married <a href="Rachel%20Wriothesley%2C%20Lady%20Russell">Lady Rachel Vaughan</a>, one of the daughters of the <a href="4th%20Earl%20of%20Southampton">4th Earl of Southampton</a>. 

By the 18th century, Covent Garden had become a well-known red-light district, attracting notable prostitutes such as <a href="Betty%20Careless">Betty Careless</a> and <a href="Jane%20Douglas">Jane Douglas</a>. Descriptions of the prostitutes and where to find them were provided by "<a href="Harris%27s%20List%20of%20Covent%20Garden%20Ladies">Harris's List of Covent Garden Ladies</a>", the "essential guide and accessory for any serious gentleman of pleasure". In 1830 a market hall was built to provide a more permanent trading centre. In 1913, <a href="Herbrand%20Russell%2C%2011th%20Duke%20of%20Bedford">Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford</a>, agreed to sell the Covent Garden Estate for £2 million to the MP and land speculator <a href="Harry%20Mallaby-Deeley">Harry Mallaby-Deeley</a>, who sold his option in 1918 to the <a href="Thomas%20Beecham%23Covent%20Garden%20estate">Beecham</a> family for £250,000.
The Covent Garden Estate was part of <a href="Beecham%27s%20Pills">Beecham Estates and Pills Limited</a> from 1924 to 1928, after which it was managed by a successor company called Covent Garden Properties, owned by the Beechams and other private investors. This new company sold some properties at Covent Garden, while becoming active in property investment in other parts of London. In 1962 the bulk of the remaining properties in the Covent Garden area, including the market, were sold to the newly established government-owned Covent Garden Authority for £3,925,000.

By the end of the 1960s, traffic congestion had reached such a level that the use of the square as a modern wholesale distribution market was becoming untenable, and significant redevelopment was planned. Following a public outcry, buildings around the square were protected in 1973, preventing redevelopment. The following year the market moved to a new site in Nine Elms, between <a href="Battersea">Battersea</a> and <a href="Vauxhall">Vauxhall</a> in south-west London. The square languished until its central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980.

After consulting with residents and local businesses, Westminster Council drew up an action plan to improve the area while retaining its historic character in 2004. The market buildings, along with several other properties in Covent Garden, were bought by a property company in 2006.

Historically, the Bedford Estate defined the boundary of Covent Garden, with Drury Lane to the east, the Strand to the south, St Martin's Lane to the west, and Long Acre to the north. However, over time the area regarded as part of Covent Garden has expanded northwards past Long Acre to <a href="High%20Holborn">High Holborn</a>. Since 1971, with the creation of the Covent Garden Conservation Area which incorporated part of the area between St Martin's Lane and Charing Cross Road, Charing Cross Road has sometimes been taken as its western boundary. Long Acre is the main thoroughfare, running north-east from St Martin's Lane to Drury Lane. Shelton Street, running parallel to the north of Long Acre, marks the London borough boundary between Camden and Westminster.

The area to the south of Long Acre contains the <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Royal Opera House</a>, the market and central square, and most of the elegant buildings, theatres and entertainment facilities, including the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a>, and the London Transport Museum; while the area to the north of Long Acre is largely given over to independent retail units centred on Neal Street, Neal's Yard and <a href="Seven%20Dials%2C%20London">Seven Dials</a>; though this area also contains residential buildings such as Odhams Walk, built in 1981 on the site of the <a href="Odhams">Odhams</a> print works, and is home to 7,000 residents.

The Covent Garden estate was originally under the control of Westminster Abbey and lay in the <a href="civil%20parish">parish</a> of <a href="Westminster%20St%20Margaret%20and%20St%20John">St Margaret</a>. During a reorganisation in 1542 it was transferred to <a href="St%20Martin%20in%20the%20Fields%20%28parish%29">St Martin in the Fields</a>, and then in 1645 a new parish was created, splitting governance of the estate between the parishes of <a href="St%20Paul%20Covent%20Garden">St Paul Covent Garden</a> and St Martin, both still within the <a href="Liberty%20of%20Westminster">Liberty of Westminster</a>. St Paul Covent Garden was completely surrounded by the parish of St Martin in the Fields. It was grouped into the <a href="Strand%20District%20%28Metropolis%29">Strand District</a> in 1855 when it came within the area of responsibility of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Board%20of%20Works">Metropolitan Board of Works</a>.

In 1889 the parish became part of the <a href="County%20of%20London">County of London</a> and in 1900 it became part of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Westminster">Metropolitan Borough of Westminster</a>. It was abolished as a civil parish in 1922. Since 1965 Covent Garden falls within the London boroughs of <a href="City%20of%20Westminster">Westminster</a> and <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Camden">Camden</a>, and is in the Parliamentary constituencies of <a href="Cities%20of%20London%20and%20Westminster%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Cities of London and Westminster</a> and <a href="Holborn%20and%20St%20Pancras%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Holborn and St Pancras</a>. For local council elections it falls within the St James's ward for Westminster, and the <a href="Holborn%20and%20Covent%20Garden%20%28ward%29">Holborn and Covent Garden ward</a> for Camden.

Covent Garden Market reopened as a retail centre in 1979, and the largest <a href="Apple%20Store">Apple Store</a> in the world opened in The Piazza in 2010. The central hall has shops, cafes and bars alongside the Apple Market stalls selling antiques, jewellery, clothing and gifts; there are additional casual stalls in the Jubilee Hall Market on the south side of the square. Long Acre has clothes shops and boutiques, and Neal Street is noted for its numerous shoe shops. London Transport Museum and the side entrance to the Royal Opera House box office and other facilities are also located on the square. During the late 1970s and 1980s the "Rock Garden" music venue was popular with up and coming <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> and <a href="new%20wave%20music">new wave</a> artists.

The market halls and several other buildings in Covent Garden were bought by CapCo in partnership with <a href="GE%20Real%20Estate">GE Real Estate</a> in August 2006 for £421 million, on a 150-year <a href="head%20lease">head lease</a>. The buildings are let to the Covent Garden Area Trust, who pay an annual <a href="peppercorn%20%28legal%29">peppercorn rent</a> of one red apple and a posy of flowers for each head lease, and the Trust protects the property from being redeveloped. In March 2007 CapCo also acquired the shops located under the Royal Opera House. The complete Covent Garden Estate owned by CapCo consists of , and has a market value of £650 million.

The Royal Opera House, often referred to as simply "Covent Garden", was constructed as the "Theatre Royal" in 1732 to a design by <a href="Edward%20Shepherd">Edward Shepherd</a>. During the first hundred years or so of its history, the theatre was primarily a playhouse, with the <a href="Letters%20Patent">Letters Patent</a> granted by Charles II giving Covent Garden and Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, exclusive rights to present spoken drama in London. In 1734, the first ballet was presented; a year later <a href="Handel">Handel</a>'s first season of operas began. Many of his operas and <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a>s were specifically written for Covent Garden and had their premières here. It has been the home of <a href="Royal%20Opera%2C%20London">The Royal Opera</a> since 1945, and the <a href="Royal%20Ballet%2C%20London">Royal Ballet</a> since 1946.

The current building is the third theatre on the site following destructive fires in 1808 and 1857. The façade, foyer and auditorium were designed by <a href="Edward%20Middleton%20Barry">Edward Barry</a>, and date from 1858, but almost every other element of the present complex dates from an extensive £178 million reconstruction in the 1990s. The main auditorium is a <a href="Listed_building%23Categories_of_listed_buildings">Grade I listed building</a>. The inclusion of the adjacent old Floral Hall, previously a part of the old Covent Garden Market, created a large new public gathering place. In 1779 the pavement outside the playhouse was the scene of the murder of <a href="Martha%20Ray">Martha Ray</a>, mistress of the <a href="John%20Montagu%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Sandwich">Earl of Sandwich</a>, by her admirer the Rev. <a href="James%20Hackman">James Hackman</a>.

The central square in Covent Garden is simply called "Covent Garden", often marketed as "Covent Garden Piazza" to distinguish it from the eponymous surrounding area. Designed and laid out in 1630, it was the first modern square in London—originally a flat, open space or <a href="piazza">piazza</a> with low railings. From about 1635 onwards there were many <a href="List%20of%20private%20residents%20of%20Covent%20Garden">private residents of note</a>, including the nobility, living in the Great Piazza. A casual market started on the south side, and by 1830 the present market hall had been built. The space is popular with street performers, who audition with the site's owners for an allocated slot. The square was originally laid out when the 4th Earl of Bedford, Francis Russell, commissioned Inigo Jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around the site of a former walled garden belonging to Westminster Abbey. Jones's design was informed by his knowledge of modern town planning in Europe, particularly Piazza d'Arme, in <a href="Leghorn%2C%20Tuscany">Leghorn, Tuscany</a>, <a href="Piazza%20San%20Marco">Piazza San Marco</a> in Venice, <a href="Piazza%20Santissima%20Annunziata">Piazza Santissima Annunziata</a> in Florence, and the <a href="Place%20des%20Vosges">Place des Vosges</a> in Paris. The centrepiece of the project was the large square, the concept of which was new to London, and this had a significant influence on modern town planning as the metropolis grew, acting as the prototype for the design of new estates, such as the <a href="Ladbroke%20Estate">Ladbroke Estate</a> and the <a href="Grosvenor%20Estate">Grosvenor Estate</a>. <a href="Isaac%20de%20Caus">Isaac de Caus</a>, the <a href="French%20Huguenot">French Huguenot</a> architect, designed the individual houses under Jones's overall design.

The church of <a href="St%20Paul%27s%2C%20Covent%20Garden">St Paul's</a> was the first building, and was begun in July 1631 on the western side of the square. The last house was completed in 1637. Seventeen of the houses had <a href="Arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcaded</a> <a href="portico">portico</a> walks organised in groups of four and six either side of James Street on the north side, and three and four either side of Russell Street. These arcades, rather than the square itself, took the name Piazza; the group from James Street to Russell Street became known as the "Great Piazza" and that to the south of Russell Street as the "Little Piazza". None of Inigo Jones's houses remain, though part of the north group was reconstructed in 1877–79 as Bedford Chambers by <a href="William%20Cubitt%20%28politician%29">William Cubitt</a> to a design by <a href="Henry%20Clutton">Henry Clutton</a>.

The first record of a "new market in Covent Garden" is in 1654 when market traders set up stalls against the garden wall of Bedford House. The Earl of Bedford acquired a private charter from <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> in 1670 for a fruit and vegetable market, permitting him and his heirs to hold a market every day except Sundays and Christmas Day. The original market, consisting of wooden stalls and sheds, became disorganised and disorderly, and <a href="John%20Russell%2C%206th%20Duke%20of%20Bedford">John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford</a>, requested an Act of Parliament in 1813 to regulate it, then commissioned Charles Fowler in 1830 to design the neo-classical market building that is the heart of Covent Garden today. The contractor was <a href="William%20Cubitt%20%28politician%29">William Cubitt and Company</a>. Further buildings were added—the Floral hall, Charter Market, and in 1904 the Jubilee Market for foreign flowers was built by Cubitt and Howard.

By the end of the 1960s, traffic congestion was causing problems for the market, which required increasingly large lorries for deliveries and distribution. Redevelopment was considered, but protests from the Covent Garden Community Association in 1973 prompted the Home Secretary, <a href="Robert%20Carr">Robert Carr</a>, to give dozens of buildings around the square listed-building status, preventing redevelopment. The following year the market relocated to its new site, New Covent Garden Market, about three miles (5 km) south-west at <a href="Nine%20Elms">Nine Elms</a>. The central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980, with cafes, pubs, small shops and a craft market called the Apple Market. Among the first shops to relocate here was <a href="Benjamin%20Pollock%27s%20Toy%20Shop">Benjamin Pollock's Toy Shop</a>. Another market, the Jubilee Market, is held in the Jubilee Hall on the south side of the square. The market halls and several other buildings in Covent Garden have been owned by the property company <a href="Capital%20%26amp%3B%20Counties%20Properties">Capital & Counties Properties</a> (CapCo) since 2006.

The current Theatre Royal on Drury Lane is the most recent of four incarnations, the first of which opened in 1663, making it the oldest continuously used theatre in London. For much of its first two centuries, it was, along with the Royal Opera House, a <a href="patent%20theatre">patent theatre</a> granted rights in London for the production of drama, and had a claim to be one of London's leading theatres. The first theatre, known as "Theatre Royal, Bridges Street", saw performances by <a href="Nell%20Gwyn">Nell Gwyn</a> and <a href="Charles%20Hart%20%2817th-century%20actor%29">Charles Hart</a>. After it was destroyed by fire in 1672, English dramatist and theatre manager <a href="Thomas%20Killigrew">Thomas Killigrew</a> constructed a larger theatre on the same spot, which opened in 1674. Killigrew's theatre lasted nearly 120 years, under leadership including <a href="Colley%20Cibber">Colley Cibber</a>, <a href="David%20Garrick">David Garrick</a>, and <a href="Richard%20Brinsley%20Sheridan">Richard Brinsley Sheridan</a>. In 1791, under Sheridan's management, the building was demolished to make way for a larger theatre which opened in 1794. However that survived only 15 years, burning down in 1809. The building that stands today opened in 1812. It has been home to actors as diverse as Shakespearean actor <a href="Edmund%20Kean">Edmund Kean</a>, child actress <a href="Clara%20Fisher">Clara Fisher</a>, comedian <a href="Dan%20Leno">Dan Leno</a>, the comedy troupe <a href="Monty%20Python">Monty Python</a> (who recorded a concert album there), and musical composer and performer <a href="Ivor%20Novello">Ivor Novello</a>. Since November 2008 the theatre has been owned by composer <a href="Andrew%20Lloyd%20Webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a> and generally stages popular musical theatre. It is a Grade I listed building.

The London Transport Museum is in a <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian</a> iron and glass building on the east side of the market square. It was designed as a dedicated flower market by William Rogers of <a href="Holland%2C%20Hannen%20%26amp%3B%20Cubitts">William Cubitt and Company</a> in 1871, and was first occupied by the museum in 1980. Previously the transport collection had been held at <a href="Syon%20Park">Syon Park</a> and <a href="Clapham">Clapham</a>. The first parts of the collection were brought together at the beginning of the 20th century by the <a href="London%20General%20Omnibus%20Company">London General Omnibus Company</a> (LGOC) when it began to preserve buses being retired from service. After the LGOC was taken over by the <a href="London%20Electric%20Railway">London Electric Railway</a> (LER), the collection was expanded to include rail vehicles. It continued to expand after the LER became part of the <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Passenger Transport Board</a> in the 1930s and as the organisation passed through various successor bodies up to TfL, London's transport authority since 2000. The Covent Garden building has on display many examples of buses, trams, <a href="trolleybus">trolleybus</a>es and rail vehicles from the 19th and 20th centuries as well as artefacts and exhibits related to the operation and marketing of passenger services and the impact that the developing transport network has had on the city and its population.

St Paul's, commonly known as the Actors' Church, was built in 1633, at a cost of £4,000, though was not consecrated until 1638. In 1645 Covent Garden was made a separate parish and the church was dedicated to <a href="St%20Paul">St Paul</a>. How much of Jones's original building is left is unclear, as the church was damaged by fire in 1795 during restoration work by <a href="Thomas%20Hardwick">Thomas Hardwick</a>; the columns are thought to be original but the rest is mostly Georgian or Victorian reconstruction.

Freemasons' Hall is the headquarters of the <a href="United%20Grand%20Lodge%20of%20England">United Grand Lodge of England</a> and the <a href="Holy%20Royal%20Arch">Supreme Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of England</a>, as well as a meeting place for many <a href="Masonic%20Lodge">Masonic Lodge</a>s in the London area. It is in <a href="Great%20Queen%20Street">Great Queen Street</a> between <a href="Holborn">Holborn</a> and Covent Garden and has been a Masonic meeting place since 1775. Parts of the building are open to the public daily, and its preserved classic <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> style, together with its regular use as a film and television location, have made it a tourist destination.

The Covent Garden area has long been associated with entertainment and shopping. Covent Garden has 13 theatres, and over 60 pubs and bars, with most south of Long Acre, around the main shopping area of the old market. The Seven Dials area in the north of Covent Garden was home to the punk rock club <a href="The%20Roxy%20%28Covent%20Garden%29">The Roxy</a> in 1977, and the area remains focused on young people with its trendy mid-market retail outlets.

Street entertainment at Covent Garden was noted in <a href="Samuel%20Pepys">Samuel Pepys</a>'s diary in May 1662, when he recorded the first mention of a <a href="Punch%20and%20Judy">Punch and Judy</a> show in Britain. Impromptu performances of song and swimming were given by local celebrity <a href="William%20Cussans">William Cussans</a> in the eighteenth century. Covent Garden is licensed for street entertainment, and performers audition for timetabled slots in a number of venues around the market, including the North Hall, West Piazza, and South Hall Courtyard. The courtyard space is dedicated to classical music only. There are street performances at Covent Garden Market every day of the year, except Christmas Day. Shows run throughout the day and are about 30 minutes in length. In March 2008, the market owner, CapCo, proposed to reduce street performances to one 30-minute show each hour.
The Covent Garden area has over 60 pubs and bars; several of them are listed buildings, with some also on <a href="Campaign%20for%20Real%20Ale">CAMRA</a>'s <a href="National%20Inventory%20of%20Historic%20Pub%20Interiors">National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors</a>; some, such as <a href="The%20Harp">The Harp</a> in Chandos Place, have received consumer awards. The Harp's awards include <a href="SPBW%20London%20Pub%20of%20the%20Year">London Pub of the Year</a> in 2008 by the <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Preservation%20of%20Beers%20from%20the%20Wood">Society for the Preservation of Beers from the Wood</a>, and <a href="National%20Pub%20of%20the%20Year">National Pub of the Year</a> by CAMRA in 2010. It was at one time owned by the <a href="Charrington%20Brewery">Charrington Brewery</a>, when it was known as The Welsh Harp; in 1995 the name was abbreviated to just The Harp, before Charrington sold it to <a href="Punch%20Taverns">Punch Taverns</a> in 1997. It was eventually purchased by the landlady Binnie Walsh around 2010 then subsequently sold by her to <a href="Fuller%27s%20Brewery">Fuller's Brewery</a> in 2014. It continues to win regular CAMRA pub awards under its new owners.

The <a href="Lamb%20and%20Flag%2C%20Covent%20Garden">Lamb and Flag</a> in Rose Street is possibly the oldest pub in the area. The first mention of a pub on the site is 1772 (when it was called the Cooper's Arms – the name changing to Lamb & Flag in 1833); the 1958 brick exterior conceals what may be an early 18th-century frame of a house replacing the original one built in 1638. The pub acquired a reputation for staging bare-knuckle prize fights during the early 19th century when it earned the nickname "Bucket of Blood". The alleyway beside the pub was the scene of an attack on <a href="John%20Dryden">John Dryden</a> in 1679 by thugs hired by <a href="John%20Wilmot%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Rochester">John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester</a>, with whom he had a long-standing conflict.

<a href="The%20Salisbury%2C%20Covent%20Garden">The Salisbury</a> in St Martin's Lane was built as part of a six-storey block around 1899 on the site of an earlier pub that had been known under several names, including the Coach & Horses and Ben Caunt's Head; it is both Grade II listed, and on CAMRA's National Inventory, due to the quality of the etched and polished glass and the carved woodwork, summed up as "good <a href="fin%20de%20si%C3%A8cle">fin de siècle</a> ensemble". The Freemasons Arms on Long Acre is linked with the founding of <a href="the%20Football%20Association">the Football Association</a> in 1896; however, the meetings took place at The <a href="Freemason%27s%20Tavern">Freemason's Tavern</a> on Great Queen Street, which was replaced in 1909 by the Connaught Rooms.

Other Grade II listed pubs include three 19th century rebuilds of 17th century/18th century houses, the Nell Gwynne Tavern in Bull Inn Court, the Nag's Head on James Street, and the White Swan on New Row; a Victorian pub built by lessees of the Marquis of Exeter, the Old Bell on the corner of Exeter Street and Wellington Street; and a late 18th or early 19th century pub the Angel and Crown on St Martin's Lane.

There is a wide range of restaurants, mainly in Covent Garden's central area around the piazza, and in the St Martin's Lane area bordering the West End; some of these with international reputations. Among the restaurants are the historic theatrical eating places, the oldest of which is <a href="Rules%20%28restaurant%29">Rules</a>, which was founded in 1798, making it the oldest restaurant in London, followed by J. Sheekey, an oyster bar and fish restaurant founded in 1893 by market-stall holder Josef Sheekey in <a href="Lord%20Salisbury">Lord Salisbury</a>'s St Martin's Court, and <a href="The%20Ivy">The Ivy</a>, which was founded as an unlicensed Italian cafe by Abel Giandellini in 1917. Other restaurants include Belgo Centraal on Earlham Street, part of the <a href="Belgo">Belgo</a> chain of Belgian themed restaurants; one of <a href="Jamie%20Oliver">Jamie Oliver</a>'s Italian restaurants, which opened in 2007; <a href="Gaby%27s%20Deli">Gaby's Deli</a>, a Jewish cafe and restaurant serving falafels and salt beef sandwiches since 1965, and Mon Plaisir, founded in 1943, one of the oldest French restaurants in London. Covent Garden was home to some of London's earliest coffee shops, such as <a href="Old%20Slaughter%27s%20Coffee%20House">Old Slaughter's Coffee House</a>, which ran from 1692 until 1843, and a <a href="Beefsteak%20Club">Beefsteak Club</a>, the Sublime Society of Beef Steaks, which was co-founded in 1736 by <a href="William%20Hogarth">William Hogarth</a> at the Theatre Royal (now the Royal Opera House).

Covent Garden, and especially the market, have appeared in a number of works. In 1867, <a href="Johann%20Strauss%20II">Johann Strauss II</a> from Austria composed "Erinnerung an Covent Garden" (Memory of Covent Garden, op. 329). <a href="Eliza%20Doolittle">Eliza Doolittle</a>, the central character in <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a>'s play, "<a href="Pygmalion%20%28play%29">Pygmalion</a>", and the musical adaptation by <a href="Alan%20Jay%20Lerner">Alan Jay Lerner</a>, "<a href="My%20Fair%20Lady">My Fair Lady</a>", is a Covent Garden flower seller. <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s 1972 film "<a href="Frenzy">Frenzy</a>" about a Covent Garden fruit vendor who becomes a serial sex killer, was set in the market where his father had been a wholesale greengrocer. The daily activity of the market was the topic of a 1957 <a href="Free%20Cinema">Free Cinema</a> documentary by <a href="Lindsay%20Anderson">Lindsay Anderson</a>, "<a href="Every%20Day%20Except%20Christmas">Every Day Except Christmas</a>", which won the Grand Prix at the Venice Festival of Shorts and Documentaries.

Covent Garden is served by the <a href="Piccadilly%20line">Piccadilly line</a> at Covent Garden Underground station on the corner of Long Acre and James Street. The station was designed by <a href="Leslie%20Green">Leslie Green</a> and opened by the <a href="Great%20Northern%2C%20Piccadilly%20and%20Brompton%20Railway">Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway</a> on 11 April 1907, four months after services on the rest of the line began operating on 15 December 1906. The station is one of the few stations in Central London for which platform access is only by lift or stairs. Until improvements in 2007, due to high passenger numbers (16 million annually), entry to the station was sometimes restricted on busy days to reduce congestion on the platforms. The distance from Covent Garden to Leicester Square at less than 300 yards is London's shortest tube journey. Stations just outside the area include the <a href="Charing%20Cross%20tube%20station">Charing Cross Underground station</a> and <a href="Charing%20Cross%20railway%20station">Charing Cross railway station</a>, <a href="Embankment%20tube%20station">Embankment Underground station</a>, <a href="Leicester%20Square%20tube%20station">Leicester Square Underground station</a>, and <a href="Holborn%20tube%20station">Holborn Underground station</a>. While there is only one bus route in Covent Garden itself—the <a href="London%20Buses%20route%20RV1">RV1</a>, which uses Catherine Street as a terminus, just to the east of Covent Garden square—there are over 30 routes which pass close by, mostly on the Strand or <a href="Kingsway%20%28London%29">Kingsway</a>.

Samantha Smith

Samantha Reed Smith (June 29, 1972 – August 25, 1985) was an American schoolgirl, <a href="List%20of%20peace%20activists">peace activist</a> and <a href="child%20actress">child actress</a> from <a href="Manchester%2C%20Maine">Manchester, Maine</a>, who became famous during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> between the United States and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. In 1982, Smith wrote a letter to the newly appointed <a href="General%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">CPSU General Secretary</a> <a href="Yuri%20Andropov">Yuri Andropov</a>, and received a personal reply with a personal invitation to visit the Soviet Union, which she accepted.

Smith attracted extensive media attention in both countries as a "<a href="Goodwill%20Ambassador">Goodwill Ambassador</a>", becoming known as "America's Youngest Ambassador" and subsequently participating in <a href="peacemaking">peacemaking</a> activities in Japan. She wrote a book about her visit to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, "Journey to the Soviet Union", and later became a child actress, hosting a child-orientated special on the <a href="1984%20United%20States%20presidential%20election">1984 United States presidential election</a> for <a href="Disney%20Channel">The Disney Channel</a> and playing a supporting role in the television series "<a href="Lime%20Street%20%28TV%20series%29">Lime Street</a>", before she was killed at the age of thirteen on 25 August 1985 in the <a href="Bar%20Harbor%20Airlines%20Flight%201808">Bar Harbor Airlines Flight 1808</a> plane crash.

When Yuri Andropov succeeded <a href="Leonid%20Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a> as leader of the Soviet Union in November 1982, the mainstream <a href="Western%20world">Western</a> newspapers and magazines ran numerous front-page photographs and articles about him. Most coverage was negative and tended to give a perception of a new threat to the stability of the Western world. Andropov had been the Soviet Ambassador to <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> during the <a href="1956%20Hungarian%20Revolution">1956 Hungarian Revolution</a> and the Chairman of the <a href="KGB">KGB</a> from 1967 to 1982; during his tenure, he was known in the West for <a href="Warsaw%20Pact%20invasion%20of%20Czechoslovakia">crushing the Prague Spring</a> and the brutal suppression of dissidents, such as <a href="Andrei%20Sakharov">Andrei Sakharov</a> and <a href="Aleksandr%20Solzhenitsyn">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</a>. He began his tenure as Soviet leader by strengthening the powers of the <a href="KGB">KGB</a>, and by suppressing dissidents. Andropov declared, "the struggle for human rights was a part of a wide-ranging imperialist plot to undermine the foundation of the Soviet state." Much international tension surrounded both Soviet and American efforts to develop weapons capable of being launched from satellites in orbit. Both governments had extensive research and development programs to develop such technology. However, both nations were coming under increasing pressure to disband the project. In America, <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> came under pressure from a lobby of U.S. scientists and arms experts, while in Russia the government issued a statement that read, "To prevent the militarization of space is one of the most urgent tasks facing mankind".

During this period, large <a href="anti-nuclear%20protests">anti-nuclear protests</a> were taking place across both <a href="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, while the November 20, 1983, screening of <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a>'s post-<a href="Nuclear%20warfare">nuclear war</a> dramatization "<a href="The%20Day%20After">The Day After</a>" became one of the most anticipated media events of the decade.

The two <a href="superpower">superpower</a>s had by this point abandoned their strategy of "<a href="d%C3%A9tente">détente</a>" and in response to the Soviet deployment of <a href="SS-20">SS-20</a>s, Reagan moved to deploy <a href="cruise%20missile">cruise</a> and <a href="Pershing%20II">Pershing II</a> missiles to Europe. The Soviet Union's involvement in a <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan">war in Afghanistan</a> was in its third year, a matter which was also contributing to international tension. In this atmosphere, on November 22, 1982, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine published an issue with Andropov on the cover. When Smith viewed the edition, she asked her mother: "If people are so afraid of him, why doesn't someone write a letter asking whether he wants to have a war or not?" Her mother replied, "Why don't you?"

Samantha Smith was born on June 29, 1972, in the small town of <a href="Houlton%2C%20Maine">Houlton, Maine</a>, on the <a href="Canada">Canada</a>–<a href="United%20States">United States</a> border, to Jane Goshorn and Arthur Smith. At the age of five, she wrote a letter to <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> in order to express her admiration to the monarch. When Smith had finished second grade in the spring of 1980, the family settled in <a href="Manchester%2C%20Maine">Manchester, Maine</a>, where she attended Manchester Elementary School. Her father served as an instructor at <a href="Ricker%20College">Ricker College</a> in Houlton before teaching literature and writing at the <a href="University%20of%20Maine%20at%20Augusta">University of Maine at Augusta</a> while her mother worked as a <a href="social%20worker">social worker</a> with the Maine Department of Human Services.

In November 1982, when Smith was 10 years old, she wrote to <a href="General%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Soviet leader</a> <a href="Yuri%20Andropov">Yuri Andropov</a>, seeking to understand why the <a href="Soviet%20Union%E2%80%93United%20States%20relations">relations between the Soviet Union and the United States</a> were so tense:

Her letter was published in the Soviet newspaper "<a href="Pravda">Pravda</a>".
Samantha was happy to discover that her letter had been published; however, she had not received a reply. She then sent a letter to the Soviet Union's Ambassador to the United States asking if Mr. Andropov intended to respond. On April 26, 1983, she received a response from Andropov:

A <a href="media%20circus">media circus</a> ensued, with Smith being interviewed by <a href="Ted%20Koppel">Ted Koppel</a> and <a href="Johnny%20Carson">Johnny Carson</a>, among others, and with nightly reports by the major American networks. On July 7, 1983, she flew to Moscow with her parents, and spent two weeks as Andropov's guest. During the trip she visited <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> and <a href="Leningrad">Leningrad</a> and spent time in <a href="Artek%20%28camp%29">Artek</a>, the main Soviet <a href="Young%20Pioneer%20organization%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">pioneer</a> camp, in the town of <a href="Gurzuf">Gurzuf</a> on the <a href="Crimea">Crimean Peninsula</a>. Smith wrote in her book that in Leningrad she and her parents were amazed by the friendliness of the people and by the presents many people made for them. Speaking at a Moscow press conference, she declared that the Russians were "just like us". In Artek, Smith chose to stay with the Soviet children rather than accept the privileged accommodations offered to her. For ease of communication, teachers and children who spoke fluent English were chosen to stay in the building where she was lodged. Smith shared a dormitory with nine other girls, and spent her time there swimming, talking and learning Russian songs and dances. While there, she made many friends, including Natasha Kashirina from Leningrad, a fluent English speaker.
Andropov, however, was unable to meet with her during her visit,
although they did speak by telephone. It was later discovered that Andropov had become seriously ill and had withdrawn from the public eye during this time. Smith also received a phone call from Russian cosmonaut <a href="Valentina%20Tereshkova">Valentina Tereshkova</a>, the first woman to orbit the Earth. However, not realizing with whom she was speaking, Samantha mistakenly hung up after only a brief conversation. Media followed her every step—photographs and articles about her were published by the main Soviet newspapers and magazines throughout her trip and after it. Smith became widely known to Soviet citizens and was well regarded by many of them. In the United States, the event drew suspicion and some regarded it as an "American-style <a href="public%20relations%20stunt">public relations stunt</a>".

Smith's return to the U.S. on July 22, 1983, was celebrated by the people of <a href="Maine">Maine</a> with roses, a red carpet, and a limousine and her popularity continued to grow in her native country. Some critics at the time remained skeptical, believing Smith was unwittingly serving as an instrument of <a href="Soviet%20propaganda">Soviet propaganda</a>. In December 1983, continuing in her role as "America's Youngest Ambassador", she was invited to Japan, where she met with the Prime Minister <a href="Yasuhiro%20Nakasone">Yasuhiro Nakasone</a> and attended the Children's International Symposium in <a href="Kobe">Kobe</a>. In her speech at the symposium, she suggested that Soviet and American leaders exchange granddaughters for two weeks every year, arguing that a president "wouldn't want to send a bomb to a country his granddaughter would be visiting". Her trip inspired other exchanges of child goodwill ambassadors, including a visit by the eleven-year-old Soviet child <a href="Katya%20Lycheva">Katya Lycheva</a> to the United States. Later, Smith wrote a book called "Journey to the Soviet Union" whose cover shows her at Artek, her favorite part of the Soviet trip.

Smith pursued her role as a media celebrity when in 1984, billed as a "Special Correspondent", she hosted a children's special for the <a href="Disney%20Channel">Disney Channel</a> entitled "Samantha Smith Goes To Washington...Campaign '84". The show covered politics, where Smith interviewed several candidates for the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201984">1984 presidential election</a>, including <a href="George%20McGovern">George McGovern</a> and <a href="Jesse%20Jackson">Jesse Jackson</a>. That same year she guest starred in "<a href="Charles%20in%20Charge">Charles in Charge</a>" as Kim, alongside another celebrity guest star, <a href="Julianne%20McNamara">Julianne McNamara</a>. Her fame resulted in Smith becoming the subject of <a href="Stalking">stalker</a> <a href="Robert%20John%20Bardo">Robert John Bardo</a>, the man who would later go on to stalk and ultimately murder "<a href="My%20Sister%20Sam">My Sister Sam</a>" actress <a href="Rebecca%20Schaeffer">Rebecca Schaeffer</a>. Bardo traveled to Maine in an attempt to meet Smith, but was stopped by police and returned home.

In 1985 she played the supporting role of the elder daughter to <a href="Robert%20Wagner">Robert Wagner</a>'s character in a television series called "<a href="Lime%20Street%20%28TV%20series%29">Lime Street</a>".

On August 25, 1985, Smith and her father were returning home aboard <a href="Bar%20Harbor%20Airlines%20Flight%201808">Bar Harbor Airlines Flight 1808</a> after filming a segment for "Lime Street". While attempting to land at <a href="Auburn/Lewiston%20Municipal%20Airport">Lewiston-Auburn Regional Airport</a> in <a href="Auburn%2C%20Maine">Auburn, Maine</a>, the <a href="Beechcraft%20Model%2099">Beechcraft 99</a> commuter plane struck some trees short of the runway and crashed, killing all six passengers and two crew on board.
Much speculation regarding the cause of the accident circulated afterwards. Accusations of foul play circulated widely in the Soviet Union. An investigation was undertaken in the United States and the official report—which did not show evidence of foul play—was made public. As stated in the report, the accident occurred at about 22:05 <a href="Eastern%20Daylight%20Time">EDT</a>, the ground impact point located one mile (1.6 km) south-west of the airport, at . The report goes on to say, "The relatively steep flight path angle and the <a href="Yaw%2C%20pitch%2C%20and%20roll">attitude</a> (the orientation of the aircraft relative to the horizon, direction of motion etc.) and speed of the airplane at ground impact precluded the occupants from surviving the accident." The main point of the report was that it was a rainy night, that the pilots operating the aircraft were inexperienced, and an accidental, but not uncommon and not usually critical, ground <a href="radar">radar</a> failure occurred.

Samantha Smith was mourned by about 1,000 people at her funeral in <a href="Augusta%2C%20Maine">Augusta</a>, <a href="Maine">Maine</a>, and was eulogized in Moscow as a champion of peace. Attendees included <a href="Robert%20Wagner">Robert Wagner</a> and Vladimir Kulagin of the Soviet Embassy in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington</a>, who read a personal message of condolence from <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>.

Everyone in the Soviet Union who has known Samantha Smith will forever remember the image of the American girl who, like millions of Soviet young men and women, dreamt about peace, and about friendship between the peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union. 

President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> sent his condolences to Smith's mother, in writing,

Perhaps you can take some measure of comfort in the knowledge that millions of Americans, indeed millions of people, share the burdens of your grief. They also will cherish and remember Samantha, her smile, her <a href="Ideal%20%28ethics%29">idealism</a> and unaffected sweetness of spirit.

The remains of Samantha and her father were cremated and their ashes were buried at Estabrook Cemetery, <a href="Aroostook%20County">Aroostook County</a>, <a href="Maine">Maine</a> 

Smith's contributions have been honored with a number of tributes by Russians and by the people of her home state of Maine. A monument to her was built in Moscow; "Samantha Smith Alley" in the Artek Young Pioneer camp was named after her in 1986. The monument built to Smith was stolen by <a href="Metal%20theft">metal thieves</a> in 2003 following the <a href="dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">dissolution of the Soviet Union</a> in 1991. In 2003, <a href="Voronezh">Voronezh</a> retiree Valentin Vaulin built a monument to her without any support from the government. The Soviet Union issued a <a href="commemorative%20stamp">commemorative stamp</a> with her likeness. In 1986 Soviet astronomer <a href="Lyudmila%20Chernykh">Lyudmila Chernykh</a> discovered <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a> 3147, which she named <a href="3147%20Samantha">3147 Samantha</a>. Danish composer <a href="Per%20N%C3%B8rg%C3%A5rd">Per Nørgård</a> wrote his 1985 viola concerto "Remembering Child" in memory of Smith. A <a href="diamond">diamond</a> found in Siberia, a mountain in the former Soviet Union, a <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a> of <a href="tulip">tulip</a>s and of <a href="dahlia">dahlia</a>s, and an <a href="passenger%20ship">ocean vessel</a> have been named in Smith's honor. In Maine, the first Monday in June of each year is officially designated as Samantha Smith Day by <a href="state%20law">state law</a>. There is a bronze statue of Smith near the Maine State Museum in Augusta, which portrays Smith releasing a <a href="dove">dove</a> with a bear cub resting at her feet. The bear cub represents both Maine and Russia. Elementary schools in <a href="Sammamish%2C%20Washington">Sammamish, Washington</a>, and in <a href="Jamaica%2C%20Queens">Jamaica, Queens</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, have been named after Samantha. In October 1985, Smith's mother founded The Samantha Smith Foundation, which fostered student exchanges between the United States and the Soviet Union (and, after December 1991, the ex-Soviet successor states) until it became dormant in the mid-1990s. The Foundation was formally dissolved in 2014 after two decades of dormancy.

A 1987 episode of the U.S. sitcom "<a href="The%20Golden%20Girls">The Golden Girls</a>" entitled "<a href="The%20Golden%20Girls%20%28season%203%29">Letter to Gorbachev</a>" draws inspiration from Smith's story. In addition, the 1987 film "" included a scene where a boy writes Superman a letter to control the <a href="nuclear%20arms%20race">nuclear arms race</a>; according to <a href="Christopher%20Reeve">Christopher Reeve</a>, this scene was also inspired by Smith's story.

In the mid-1980s, after Smith's death, a script was written for a <a href="television%20movie">television movie</a> titled "The Samantha Smith Story" with <a href="Robert%20Wagner">Robert Wagner</a> as producer. <a href="Columbia%20Pictures%20Television">Columbia Pictures Television</a> and R.J. Wagner Productions were reported to have agreed to produce the film for <a href="NBC">NBC</a>, with Soviet company Sovin Film interested in co-producing it. Ultimately, Columbia Pictures Television decided not to film it due to lack of interest from any network.

Speculation as to what a surviving Samantha might have done in adulthood was dismissed by her mother Jane as unanswerable in 2003, given Samantha was only thirteen when she died and her ambitions had varied from a <a href="veterinarian">veterinarian</a> working with animals to a tutu and tights clad <a href="ballet">ballerina</a>. 
In 2008, Smith posthumously received the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award for "helping to bring about better understanding between the peoples of the [USA and the USSR], and as a result, reduce the tension between the superpowers that were poised to engage in nuclear war". The Peace Abbey has also proposed The Peace Literature Project in Honor of Samantha Smith "to educate students about peace and promote peace literature for school-age children in 50 selected pilot schools across the United States"

<a href="Elliott%20Holt">Elliott Holt</a>'s 2013 novel "<a href="You%20Are%20One%20of%20Them">You Are One of Them</a>", uses the story of Samantha Smith as inspiration for a fictional character, Jennifer Jones.

On the 30th anniversary of the plane crash in 2015, the <a href="Maine%20State%20Museum">Maine State Museum</a> opened a new exhibit of materials related to Samantha, including photographs of her time at the Artek camp, traditional Russian clothing she was given, and an issue of "<a href="Soviet%20Life">Soviet Life</a>" magazine with her on the cover.

Ralph Richardson

Sir Ralph David Richardson (19 December 1902 – 10 October 1983) was an English actor who, along with his contemporaries <a href="Peggy%20Ashcroft">Peggy Ashcroft</a>, <a href="John%20Gielgud">John Gielgud</a>, and <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>, dominated the <a href="Theatre%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British stage</a> of the mid-20th century. He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played more than sixty cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had no thought of a stage career until a production of "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>" in <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a> inspired him to become an actor. He learned his craft in the 1920s with a touring company and later the <a href="Birmingham%20Repertory%20Theatre">Birmingham Repertory Theatre</a>. In 1931 he joined the <a href="The%20Old%20Vic">Old Vic</a>, playing mostly <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>an roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who had taught him much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him to stardom in the <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> and on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a>.

In the 1940s, together with Olivier and <a href="John%20Burrell%20%28theatre%20director%29">John Burrell</a>, Richardson was the co-director of the Old Vic company. There, his most celebrated roles included <a href="Peer%20Gynt">Peer Gynt</a> and <a href="Falstaff">Falstaff</a>. He and Olivier led the company to Europe and Broadway in 1945 and 1946, before their success provoked resentment among the governing board of the Old Vic, leading to their dismissal from the company in 1947. In the 1950s, in the West End and occasionally on tour, Richardson played in modern and classic works including "<a href="The%20Heiress%20%281947%20play%29">The Heiress</a>", "<a href="Home%20at%20Seven%20%28play%29">Home at Seven</a>", and "<a href="Three%20Sisters%20%28play%29">Three Sisters</a>". He continued on stage and in films until shortly before his sudden death at the age of eighty. He was celebrated in later years for his work with <a href="Peter%20Hall%20%28director%29">Peter Hall</a>'s <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">National Theatre</a> and his frequent stage partnership with Gielgud. He was not known for his portrayal of the great tragic roles in the classics, preferring character parts in old and new plays.

Richardson's film career began as an extra in 1931. He was soon cast in leading roles in British and American films including "<a href="Things%20to%20Come">Things to Come</a>" (1936), "<a href="The%20Fallen%20Idol%20%28film%29">The Fallen Idol</a>" (1948), "<a href="Long%20Day%27s%20Journey%20into%20Night%20%281962%20film%29">Long Day's Journey into Night</a>" (1962) and "<a href="Doctor%20Zhivago%20%28film%29">Doctor Zhivago</a>" (1965). He received nominations and awards in the UK, Europe and the US for his stage and screen work from 1948 until his death. Richardson was twice nominated for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor</a>, first for "<a href="The%20Heiress">The Heiress</a>" (1949) and again (posthumously) for his final film, "" (1984).

Throughout his career, and increasingly in later years, Richardson was known for his eccentric behaviour on and off stage. He was often seen as detached from conventional ways of looking at the world, and his acting was regularly described as poetic or magical.

Richardson was born in <a href="Cheltenham">Cheltenham</a>, <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, the third son and youngest child of Arthur Richardson and his wife Lydia (née Russell). The couple had met while both were in Paris, studying with the painter <a href="William-Adolphe%20Bouguereau">William-Adolphe Bouguereau</a>. Arthur Richardson had been senior art master at <a href="Cheltenham%20Ladies%27%20College">Cheltenham Ladies' College</a> from 1893.

In 1907 the family split up; there was no divorce or formal separation, but the two elder boys, Christopher and Ambrose, remained with their father and Lydia left them, taking Ralph with her. The ostensible cause of the couple's separation was a row over Lydia's choice of wallpaper for her husband's study. According to John Miller's biography, whatever underlying causes there may have been are unknown. An earlier biographer, <a href="Garry%20O%27Connor%20%28writer%29">Garry O'Connor</a>, speculates that Arthur Richardson might have been having an extramarital affair. There does not seem to have been a religious element, although Arthur was a dedicated <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a>, whose first two sons were brought up in that faith, whereas Lydia was a devout convert to <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>ism, in which she raised Ralph. Mother and son had a variety of homes, the first of which was a bungalow converted from two railway carriages in <a href="Shoreham-by-Sea">Shoreham-by-Sea</a> on the south coast of England.

Lydia wanted Richardson to become a priest. In <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a> he served as an <a href="Altar%20server%23Altar%20servers%20in%20the%20Catholic%20Church">altar boy</a>, which he enjoyed, but when sent at about fifteen to the nearby Xaverian College, a seminary for trainee priests, he ran away. As a pupil at a series of schools he was uninterested in most subjects and was an indifferent scholar. His Latin was poor, and during church services he would improvise parts of the Latin responses, developing a talent for invention when memory failed that proved useful in his later career.
In 1919, aged sixteen, Richardson took a post as office boy with the Brighton branch of the <a href="Liverpool%20Victoria">Liverpool Victoria</a> insurance company. The pay, ten <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s a week, was attractive, but office life was not; he lacked concentration, frequently posting documents to the wrong people as well as engaging in pranks that alarmed his superiors. His paternal grandmother died and left him £500, which, he later said, transformed his life. He resigned from the office post, just in time to avoid being dismissed, and enrolled at the <a href="Brighton%20School%20of%20Art">Brighton School of Art</a>. His studies there convinced him that he lacked creativity, and that his drawing skills were not good enough.

Richardson left the art school in 1920, and considered how else he might make a career. He briefly thought of pharmacy and then of journalism, abandoning each when he learned how much study the former required and how difficult mastering shorthand for the latter would be. He was still unsure what to do, when he saw <a href="Frank%20Benson%20%28actor%29">Sir Frank Benson</a> as <a href="Prince%20Hamlet">Hamlet</a> in a touring production. He was thrilled, and felt at once that he must become an actor.

Buttressed by what was left of the legacy from his grandmother, Richardson determined to learn to act. He paid a local theatrical manager, Frank R. Growcott, ten shillings a week to take him as a member of his company and to teach him the craft of an actor. He made his stage debut in December 1920 with Growcott's St Nicholas Players at the St Nicholas Hall, Brighton, a converted bacon factory. He played a <a href="Gendarmerie">gendarme</a> in an adaptation of "<a href="Les%20Mis%C3%A9rables">Les Misérables</a>" and was soon entrusted with larger parts, including <a href="Banquo">Banquo</a> in "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>" and <a href="Malvolio">Malvolio</a> in "<a href="Twelfth%20Night">Twelfth Night</a>".

The heyday of the touring <a href="actor-manager">actor-manager</a> was nearing its end but some companies still flourished. As well as Benson's, there were those of <a href="John%20Martin-Harvey">Sir John Martin-Harvey</a>, <a href="Ben%20Greet">Ben Greet</a>, and, only slightly less prestigious, <a href="Charles%20Doran">Charles Doran</a>. Richardson wrote to all four managers: the first two did not reply; Greet saw him but had no vacancy; Doran engaged him, at a wage of £3 a week. Richardson made his first appearance as a professional actor at the Marina Theatre, <a href="Lowestoft">Lowestoft</a>, in August 1921, as Lorenzo in "<a href="The%20Merchant%20of%20Venice">The Merchant of Venice</a>". He remained with Doran's company for most of the next two years, gradually gaining more important roles, including Banquo in "Macbeth" and Mark Antony in "<a href="Julius%20Caesar%20%28play%29">Julius Caesar</a>".

Doran's company specialised in the classics, principally <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>. After two years of period costumes Richardson felt the urge to act in a modern work. He left Doran in 1923 and toured in a new play, "<a href="Outward%20Bound%20%28play%29">Outward Bound</a>" by <a href="Sutton%20Vane">Sutton Vane</a>. He returned to the classics in August 1924, in <a href="Nigel%20Playfair">Nigel Playfair</a>'s touring production of "<a href="The%20Way%20of%20the%20World">The Way of the World</a>", playing Fainall. While on that tour he married Muriel Hewitt, a young member of Doran's company, known to him as "Kit". To his great happiness, the two were able to work together for most of 1925, both being engaged by <a href="Barry%20Jackson%20%28director%29">Sir Barry Jackson</a> of the <a href="Birmingham%20Repertory%20Theatre">Birmingham Repertory Theatre</a> for a touring production of "<a href="The%20Farmer%27s%20Wife%20%28play%29">The Farmer's Wife</a>". From December of that year they were members of the main repertory company in Birmingham. Through Jackson's chief director, the veteran taskmaster <a href="H.%20K.%20Ayliff">H K Ayliff</a>, Richardson "absorbed the influence of older contemporaries like <a href="Gerald%20du%20Maurier">Gerald du Maurier</a>, <a href="Charles%20Hawtrey%20%28actor%20born%201858%29">Charles Hawtrey</a> and <a href="Mrs.%20Patrick%20Campbell">Mrs Patrick Campbell</a>." Hewitt was seen as a rising star but Richardson's talents were not yet so apparent; he was allotted supporting roles such as Lane in "<a href="The%20Importance%20of%20Being%20Earnest">The Importance of Being Earnest</a>" and Albert Prossor in "<a href="Hobson%27s%20Choice%20%28play%29">Hobson's Choice</a>".

Richardson made his London debut in July 1926 as the stranger in "<a href="Oedipus%20at%20Colonus">Oedipus at Colonus</a>" in a Sunday-night performance at the <a href="Scala%20Theatre">Scala Theatre</a>, with a cast including <a href="Percy%20Walsh">Percy Walsh</a>, <a href="John%20Laurie">John Laurie</a> and <a href="D.%20A.%20Clarke-Smith">D A Clarke-Smith</a>. He then toured for three months in <a href="Eden%20Phillpotts">Eden Phillpotts</a>'s comedy "Devonshire Cream" with Jackson's company led by <a href="Cedric%20Hardwicke">Cedric Hardwicke</a>.

When Phillpotts's next comedy, "Yellow Sands", was to be mounted at the <a href="Haymarket%20Theatre">Haymarket Theatre</a> in the <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a>, Richardson and his wife were both cast in good roles. The play opened in November 1926 and ran until September 1928; with 610 performances it was the longest London run of Richardson's entire career. During the run Muriel Hewitt began to show early symptoms of <a href="encephalitis%20lethargica">encephalitis lethargica</a>, a progressive and ultimately fatal illness.
Richardson left the run of "Yellow Sands" in March 1928 and rejoined Ayliff, playing Pygmalion in "<a href="Back%20to%20Methuselah">Back to Methuselah</a>" at the <a href="Royal%20Court%20Theatre">Royal Court Theatre</a>; also in the cast was a former colleague from the Birmingham Repertory, <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>. The critics began to notice Richardson and he gained some favourable reviews. As Tranio in Ayliff's modern-dress production of "<a href="The%20Taming%20of%20the%20Shrew">The Taming of the Shrew</a>", Richardson played the character as a breezy <a href="cockney">cockney</a>, winning praise for turning a usually dreary role into something richly entertaining. For the rest of 1928 he appeared in what Miller describes as several unremarkable modern plays. For much of 1929 he toured South Africa in <a href="Gerald%20Lawrence">Gerald Lawrence</a>'s company in three period costume plays, including "<a href="The%20School%20for%20Scandal">The School for Scandal</a>", in which he played Joseph Surface. The sole venture into <a href="musical%20comedy">musical comedy</a> of his career was in "Silver Wings" in the West End and on tour. It was not a personal triumph; the director's final injunction to the company was, "For God's sake don't let Richardson sing". In May 1930 Richardson was given the role of Roderigo in "<a href="Othello">Othello</a>" in what seemed likely to be a prestigious production, with <a href="Paul%20Robeson">Paul Robeson</a> in the title role. The biographer <a href="Ronald%20Hayman">Ronald Hayman</a> writes that though a fine singer, "Robeson had no ear for blank verse" and even <a href="Peggy%20Ashcroft">Peggy Ashcroft</a>'s superb performance as Desdemona was not enough to save the production from failure. Ashcroft's notices were laudatory, while Richardson's were mixed; they admired each other and worked together frequently during the next four decades.

In 1930 Richardson, with some misgivings, accepted an invitation to join <a href="The%20Old%20Vic">The Old Vic</a> company. The theatre, in an unfashionable location south of the <a href="River%20Thames">Thames</a>, had offered inexpensive tickets for opera and drama under its proprietor <a href="Lilian%20Baylis">Lilian Baylis</a> since 1912. Its profile had been raised considerably by Baylis's producer, <a href="Harcourt%20Williams">Harcourt Williams</a>, who in 1929 persuaded the young West End star <a href="John%20Gielgud">John Gielgud</a> to lead the drama company. For the following season Williams wanted Richardson to join, with a view to succeeding Gielgud from 1931 to 1932. Richardson agreed, though he was not sure of his own suitability for a mainly Shakespearean repertoire, and was not enthusiastic about working with Gielgud: "I found his clothes extravagant, I found his conversation flippant. He was the New Young Man of his time and I didn't like him."

The first production of the season was "<a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%201">Henry IV, Part 1</a>", with Gielgud as Hotspur and Richardson as Prince Hal; the latter was thought by "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" "vivacious, but a figure of modern comedy rather than Shakespeare." Richardson's notices, and the relationship of the two leading men, improved markedly when Gielgud, who was playing <a href="Prospero">Prospero</a>, helped Richardson with his performance as <a href="Caliban">Caliban</a> in "<a href="The%20Tempest">The Tempest</a>":

The friendship and professional association lasted until the end of Richardson's life. Gielgud wrote in 1983, "Besides cherishing our long years of work together in the theatre, where he was such an inspiring and generous partner, I grew to love him in private life as a great gentleman, a rare spirit, fair and balanced, devotedly loyal and tolerant and, as a companion, bursting with vitality, curiosity and humour." Among Richardson's other parts in his first Old Vic season, Enobarbus in "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>" gained particularly good notices. "<a href="The%20Morning%20Post">The Morning Post</a>" commented that it placed him in the first rank of Shakespearean actors. At the beginning of 1931 Baylis re-opened <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells%20Theatre">Sadler's Wells Theatre</a> with a production of "Twelfth Night" starring Gielgud as Malvolio and Richardson as <a href="Toby%20Belch">Sir Toby Belch</a>. <a href="William%20Aubrey%20Darlington">W. A. Darlington</a> in "The Daily Telegraph" wrote of Richardson's "ripe, rich and mellow Sir Toby, [which] I would go many miles to see again."

During the summer break between the Old Vic 1930–31 and 1931–32 seasons, Richardson played at the <a href="Festival%20Theatre%2C%20Malvern">Malvern Festival</a>, under the direction of his old Birmingham director, Ayliff. Salaries at the Old Vic and the Festival were not large, and Richardson was glad of a job as an extra in the 1931 film "<a href="Dreyfus%20%281931%20film%29">Dreyfus</a>". As his wife's condition worsened he needed to pay for more and more nursing; she was looked after in a succession of hospitals and care homes.

Succeeding Gielgud as leading man at the Old Vic, Richardson had a varied season, in which there were conspicuous successes interspersed with critical failures. <a href="James%20Agate">James Agate</a> was not convinced by him as the domineering <a href="Petruchio">Petruchio</a> in "The Taming of the Shrew"; in "Julius Caesar" the whole cast received tepid reviews. In "Othello" Richardson divided the critics. He emphasised the plausible charm of the murderous <a href="Iago">Iago</a> to a degree that Agate thought "very good Richardson, but indifferent Shakespeare", whereas "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" said, "He never stalked or hissed like a plain villain, and, in fact, we have seldom seen a man smile and smile and be a villain so adequately." His biggest success of the season was as <a href="Nick%20Bottom">Bottom</a> in "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>". Both Agate and Darlington commented on how the actor transformed the character from the bumbling workman to the magically changed creature on whom <a href="Titania">Titania</a> dotes. Agate wrote that most of those who had played the part hitherto "seem to have thought Bottom, with the ass's head on, was the same Bottom, only funnier. Shakespeare says he was 'translated', and Mr Richardson translated him." With <a href="Sybil%20Thorndike">Sybil Thorndike</a> as a guest star and Richardson as Ralph, "<a href="The%20Knight%20of%20the%20Burning%20Pestle">The Knight of the Burning Pestle</a>" was a hit with audiences and critics, as was a revival of "Twelfth Night", with <a href="Edith%20Evans">Edith Evans</a> as Viola and Richardson again playing Sir Toby, finishing the season to renewed praise.

Richardson returned to the Malvern Festival in August 1932. He was in four plays, the last of which, <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">Bernard Shaw</a>'s "<a href="Too%20True%20to%20Be%20Good">Too True to Be Good</a>", transferred to the <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward%20Theatre">New Theatre</a> in London the following month. The play was not liked by audiences and ran for only forty-seven performances, but Richardson, in Agate's phrase, "ran away with the piece", and established himself as a West End star. In 1933 he had his first speaking part in a film, playing the villain, Nigel Hartley, in "<a href="The%20Ghoul%20%281933%20film%29">The Ghoul</a>", which starred Cedric Hardwicke and <a href="Boris%20Karloff">Boris Karloff</a>. The following year he was cast in his first starring role in a film, as the hero in "<a href="The%20Return%20of%20Bulldog%20Drummond">The Return of Bulldog Drummond</a>". "The Times" commented, "Mr Ralph Richardson makes <a href="Bulldog%20Drummond">Drummond</a> as brave and stupid on the screen as he is in print."

Over the next two years Richardson appeared in six plays in London ranging from "<a href="Peter%20and%20Wendy">Peter Pan</a>" (as Mr Darling and Captain Hook) to "Cornelius", an allegorical play written for and dedicated to him by <a href="J.%20B.%20Priestley">JBPriestley</a>. "Cornelius" ran for two months; this was less than expected, and left Richardson with a gap in engagements in the second half of 1935. He filled it by accepting an invitation from <a href="Katharine%20Cornell">Katharine Cornell</a> and <a href="Guthrie%20McClintic">Guthrie McClintic</a> to play Mercutio in their production of "Romeo and Juliet" on a US tour and on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a>. Romeo was played by <a href="Maurice%20Evans%20%28actor%29">Maurice Evans</a> and Juliet by Cornell. Richardson's performance greatly impressed American critics, and Cornell invited him to return to New York to co-star with her in "Macbeth" and "Antony and Cleopatra", though nothing came of this.

In 1936 <a href="London%20Films">London Films</a> released "<a href="Things%20to%20Come">Things to Come</a>", in which Richardson played the swaggering warlord "The Boss". His performance parodied the Italian dictator <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> so effectively that the film was immediately banned in Italy. The producer was <a href="Alexander%20Korda">Alexander Korda</a>; the two men formed a long and mutually beneficial friendship. Richardson later said of Korda, "Though not so very much older than I am, I regarded him in a way as a father, and to me he was as generous as a prince." In May 1936 Richardson and Olivier jointly directed and starred in a new piece by Priestley, "Bees on the Boatdeck". Both actors won excellent notices, but the play, an allegory of Britain's decline, did not attract the public. It closed after four weeks, the last in a succession of West End productions in which Richardson appeared to much acclaim but which were box-office failures. In August of the same year he finally had a long-running star part, the title role in <a href="Barr%C3%A9%20Lyndon">Barré Lyndon</a>'s <a href="comedy%20thriller">comedy thriller</a>, "The Amazing Dr Clitterhouse", which played for 492 performances, closing in October 1937.

After a short run in "The Silent Knight", described by Miller as "a Hungarian fantasy in rhymed verse set in the fifteenth century", Richardson returned to the Old Vic for the 1937–38 season, playing Bottom once again and switching parts in "Othello", playing the title role, with Olivier as Iago. The director, <a href="Tyrone%20Guthrie">Tyrone Guthrie</a>, wanted to experiment with the theory that Iago's villainy is driven by suppressed homosexual love for Othello. Olivier was willing to co-operate, but Richardson was not; audiences and most critics failed to spot the supposed motivation of Olivier's Iago, and Richardson's Othello seemed underpowered. O'Connor believes that Richardson did not succeed with Othello or Macbeth because of the characters' single-minded "blind driving passion – too extreme, too inhuman", which was incomprehensible and alien to him. It was for the same reason, in O'Connor's view, that he never attempted the title roles in "Hamlet" or "<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>".

Richardson made his television debut in January 1939, reprising his 1936 stage role of the chief engineer in "Bees on the Boatdeck." His last stage part in the 1930s was Robert Johnson, an <a href="Everyman%20%28play%29">Everyman</a> figure, in Priestley's "Johnson Over Jordan" directed by <a href="Basil%20Dean">Basil Dean</a>. It was an experimental piece, using music (by <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a>) and dance as well as dialogue, and was another production in which Richardson was widely praised but which did not prosper at the box-office. After it closed, in May 1939, he did not act on stage for more than five years.

At the outbreak of war Richardson joined the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Volunteer%20Reserve">Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve</a> as a <a href="sub-lieutenant">sub-lieutenant</a> pilot. He had taken flying lessons during the 1930s and had logged 200 hours of flying time, but, though a notoriously reckless driver, he admitted to being a timid pilot. He counted himself lucky to have been accepted, but the <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a> was short of pilots. He rose to the rank of <a href="Lieutenant-Commander">lieutenant-commander</a>. His work was mostly routine administration, probably because of "the large number of planes which seemed to fall to pieces under his control", through which he acquired the nickname "<a href="RAF%20slang%23P">Pranger</a>" Richardson. He served at several bases in the south of England, and in April 1941, at the <a href="RNAS%20Lee-on-Solent%20%28HMS%20Daedalus%29">Royal Naval Air Station, Lee-on-Solent</a>, he was able to welcome Olivier, newly commissioned as a temporary sub-lieutenant. Olivier rapidly eclipsed Richardson's record for pranging.

In 1942, on his way to visit his wife at the cottage where she was cared for by a devoted couple, Richardson crashed his motor-bike and was in hospital for several weeks. Kit was at that point mobile enough to visit him, but later in the year her condition worsened and in October she died. He was intensely lonely, though the comradeship of naval life was some comfort. In 1944 he married again. His second wife was the actress <a href="Meriel%20Forbes">Meriel Forbes</a>, a member of the <a href="Johnston%20Forbes-Robertson">Forbes-Robertson</a> theatrical family. The marriage brought him lifelong happiness and a son, Charles (1945–98), who became a television stage manager.

During the war Richardson compered occasional morale-boosting shows at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> and elsewhere, and made one short film and three full-length ones, including "<a href="The%20Silver%20Fleet">The Silver Fleet</a>", in which he played a Dutch Resistance hero, and "<a href="The%20Volunteer%20%28film%29">The Volunteer</a>", a propaganda film in which he appeared as himself. 

Throughout the war Guthrie had striven to keep the Old Vic company going, even after German bombing in 1942 left the theatre a near-ruin. A small troupe toured the provinces, with Sybil Thorndike at its head. By 1944, with the tide of the war turning, Guthrie felt it time to re-establish the company in a London base, and invited Richardson to head it. Richardson made two stipulations: first, as he was unwilling to seek his own release from the forces, the governing board of the Old Vic should explain to the authorities why it should be granted; secondly, that he should share the acting and management in a triumvirate. Initially he proposed Gielgud and Olivier as his colleagues, but the former declined, saying, "It would be a disaster, you would have to spend your whole time as referee between Larry and me." It was finally agreed that the third member would be the stage director <a href="John%20Burrell%20%28theatre%20director%29">John Burrell</a>. The Old Vic governors approached the Royal Navy to secure the release of Richardson and Olivier; the <a href="Lords%20Commissioners%20of%20the%20Admiralty">Sea Lords</a> consented, with, as Olivier put it, "a speediness and lack of reluctance which was positively hurtful."

The triumvirate secured the New Theatre for their first season and recruited a company. Thorndike was joined by, among others, Harcourt Williams, <a href="Joyce%20Redman">Joyce Redman</a> and <a href="Margaret%20Leighton">Margaret Leighton</a>. It was agreed to open with a repertory of four plays: "<a href="Peer%20Gynt">Peer Gynt</a>", "<a href="Arms%20and%20the%20Man">Arms and the Man</a>", "<a href="Richard%20III%20%28play%29">Richard III</a>" and "<a href="Uncle%20Vanya">Uncle Vanya</a>". Richardson's roles were Peer, Bluntschli, Richmond and Vanya; Olivier played the Button Moulder, Sergius, Richard and Astrov. The first three productions met with acclaim from reviewers and audiences; "Uncle Vanya" had a mixed reception. "The Times" thought Olivier's Astrov "a most distinguished portrait" and Richardson's Vanya "the perfect compound of absurdity and pathos". Agate, on the other hand, commented, "'Floored for life, sir, and jolly miserable' is what "Uncle Vanya" takes three acts to say. And I just cannot believe in Mr Richardson wallowing in misery: his voice is the wrong colour." In 1945 the company toured Germany, where they were seen by many thousands of Allied servicemen; they also appeared at the <a href="Com%C3%A9die-Fran%C3%A7aise">Comédie-Française</a> theatre in Paris, the first foreign company to be given that honour. The critic <a href="Harold%20Hobson">Harold Hobson</a> wrote that Richardson and Olivier quickly "made the Old Vic the most famous theatre in the Anglo-Saxon world."
The second season, in 1945, featured two double-bills. The first consisted of "Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2". Olivier played the warrior Hotspur in the first and the doddering Justice Shallow in the second. He received good notices, but by general consent the production belonged to Richardson as Falstaff. Agate wrote, "He had everything the part wants – the exuberance, the mischief, the gusto... Here is something better than virtuosity in character-acting – the spirit of the part shining through the actor." As a teenager, the director <a href="Peter%20Hall%20%28director%29">Peter Hall</a> saw the production; he said fifty years later, "Of the performances I've seen in my life I'm gladdest I saw that." In the second double bill it was Olivier who dominated, in the title roles of "<a href="Oedipus%20Rex">Oedipus Rex</a>" and "<a href="The%20Critic">The Critic</a>". Richardson took the supporting role of Tiresias in the first, and the silent, cameo part of Lord Burleigh in the second. After the London season the company played both the double-bills and "Uncle Vanya" in a six-week season on Broadway.

The third, and final, season under the triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson, <a href="Cyrano%20de%20Bergerac%20%28play%29">Cyrano de Bergerac</a>. Olivier would have preferred the roles to be cast the other way about, but Richardson did not wish to attempt Lear. Richardson's other roles in the season were Inspector Goole in "<a href="An%20Inspector%20Calls">An Inspector Calls</a>", Face in "<a href="The%20Alchemist%20%28play%29">The Alchemist</a>" and John of Gaunt in "<a href="Richard%20II%20%28play%29">Richard II</a>", which he directed, with <a href="Alec%20Guinness">Alec Guinness</a> in the title role.

During the run of "Cyrano", Richardson was <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a> in the <a href="1947%20New%20Year%20Honours">1947 New Year Honours</a>, to Olivier's undisguised envy. The younger man received the accolade six months later, by which time the days of the triumvirate were numbered. The high profile of the two star actors did not endear them to the new chairman of the Old Vic governors, <a href="Oliver%20Sylvain%20Baliol%20Brett%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Esher">Lord Esher</a>. He had ambitions to be the first head of the National Theatre and had no intention of letting actors run it. He was encouraged by Guthrie, who, having instigated the appointment of Richardson and Olivier, had come to resent their knighthoods and international fame. Esher terminated their contracts while both were out of the country, and they and Burrell were said to have "resigned".

Looking back in 1971, <a href="Bernard%20Levin">Bernard Levin</a> wrote that the Old Vic company of 1944 to 1947 "was probably the most illustrious that has ever been assembled in this country". "The Times" said that the triumvirate's years were the greatest in the Old Vic's history; as "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" put it, "the governors summarily sacked them in the interests of a more mediocre company spirit".

For Richardson, parting company with the Old Vic brought the advantage of being free, for the first time, to earn substantial pay. The company's highest salary had been £40 a week. After his final Old Vic season he made two films in quick succession for Korda. The first, "<a href="Anna%20Karenina%20%281948%20film%29">Anna Karenina</a>", with <a href="Vivien%20Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a>, was an expensive failure, although Richardson's notices in the role of Karenin were excellent. The second, "<a href="The%20Fallen%20Idol%20%28film%29">The Fallen Idol</a>", had notable commercial and critical success, and won awards in Europe and America. It remained one of Richardson's favourites of his films. In Miller's words, "<a href="Carol%20Reed">Carol Reed</a>'s sensitive direction drew faultless performances not just from Ralph as Baines (the butler and mistakenly suspected murderer), but also from <a href="Mich%C3%A8le%20Morgan">Michèle Morgan</a> as his mistress, <a href="Sonia%20Dresdel">Sonia Dresdel</a> as his cold-hearted wife, and especially from <a href="Bobby%20Henrey">Bobby Henrey</a> as the distraught boy, Felipe."

Richardson had gained a national reputation as a great actor while at the Old Vic; films gave him the opportunity to reach an international audience. Unlike some of his theatre colleagues, he was never condescending about film work. He admitted that film could be "a cage for an actor, but a cage in which they sometimes put a little gold", but he did not regard filming as merely a means of subsidising his much less profitable stage work. He said, "I've never been one of those chaps who scoff at films. I think they're a marvellous medium, and are to the stage what engravings are to painting. The theatre may give you big chances, but the cinema teaches you the details of craftsmanship." "The Fallen Idol" was followed by Richardson's first <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> part. He played Dr Sloper, the overprotective father of <a href="Olivia%20de%20Havilland">Olivia de Havilland</a> in "<a href="The%20Heiress">The Heiress</a>", based on <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a>'s novel "<a href="Washington%20Square%20%28novel%29">Washington Square</a>". The film did not prosper at the box-office despite good reviews, an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a> for Havilland, and nominations for the director (<a href="William%20Wyler">William Wyler</a>) and Richardson.
"The Heiress" had been a Broadway play before it was a film. Richardson so liked his part that he decided to play it in the West End, with Ashcroft as Sloper's daughter Catherine. The piece was to open in February 1949 at Richardson's favourite theatre, the Haymarket. Rehearsals were chaotic. Burrell, whom Richardson had asked to direct, was not up to the task – possibly, Miller speculates, because of nervous exhaustion from the recent traumas at the Old Vic. With only a week to go before the first performance, the producer, <a href="Binkie%20Beaumont">Binkie Beaumont</a>, asked him to stand down, and Gielgud was recruited in his place. Matters improved astonishingly; the production was a complete success and ran in London for 644 performances.

After one long run in "The Heiress", Richardson appeared in another, <a href="R.%20C.%20Sherriff">RCSherriff</a>'s "<a href="Home%20at%20Seven%20%28play%29">Home at Seven</a>", in 1950. He played an amnesiac bank clerk who fears he may have committed murder. He later recreated the part in a radio broadcast, and in <a href="Home%20at%20Seven%20%28film%29">a film version</a>, which was his sole venture into direction for the screen. Once he had played himself into a role in a long run, Richardson felt able to work during the daytime in films, and made two others in the early 1950s beside the film of the Sherriff piece: "<a href="Outcast%20of%20the%20Islands">Outcast of the Islands</a>", directed by Carol Reed, and <a href="David%20Lean">David Lean</a>'s "<a href="The%20Sound%20Barrier">The Sound Barrier</a>", released in 1951 and 1952 respectively. For the latter he won the <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">BAFTA Award for Best Actor</a>. With his characteristic liking for switching between modern roles and the classics, his next stage part was Colonel Vershinin in "<a href="Three%20Sisters%20%28play%29">Three Sisters</a>" in 1951. He headed a strong cast, with <a href="Ren%C3%A9e%20Asherson">Renée Asherson</a>, Margaret Leighton and <a href="Celia%20Johnson">Celia Johnson</a> as the sisters, but reviewers found the production weakly directed, and some felt that Richardson failed to disguise his positive personality when playing the ineffectual Vershinin. He did not attempt Chekhov again for more than a quarter of a century.
In 1952 Richardson appeared at the <a href="Stratford-upon-Avon">Stratford-upon-Avon</a> Festival at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre (forerunner of the <a href="Royal%20Shakespeare%20Company">Royal Shakespeare Company</a>). His return to Shakespeare for the first time since his Old Vic days was keenly anticipated, but turned out to be a serious disappointment. He had poor reviews for his Prospero in "The Tempest", judged too prosaic. In the second production of the festival his Macbeth, directed by Gielgud, was generally considered a failure. He was thought unconvincingly villainous; the influential young critic <a href="Kenneth%20Tynan">Kenneth Tynan</a> professed himself "unmoved to the point of paralysis," though blaming the director more than the star. Richardson's third and final role in the Stratford season, <a href="Volpone">Volpone</a> in <a href="Ben%20Jonson">Ben Jonson</a>'s play, received much better, but not ecstatic, notices. He did not play at Stratford again.

Back in the West End, Richardson was in another Sherriff play, "<a href="The%20White%20Carnation">The White Carnation</a>", in 1953, and in November of the same year he and Gielgud starred together in <a href="N.%20C.%20Hunter">NCHunter</a>'s "A Day by the Sea", which ran at the Haymarket for 386 performances. During this period, Richardson played <a href="Dr.%20Watson">Dr Watson</a> in an American/BBC radio co-production of <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> stories, with Gielgud as Holmes and <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a> as the evil Professor Moriarty. These recordings were later released commercially on disc.

In late 1954 and early 1955 Richardson and his wife toured Australia together with Sybil Thorndike and her husband, <a href="Lewis%20Casson">Lewis Casson</a>, playing <a href="Terence%20Rattigan">Terence Rattigan</a>'s plays "<a href="The%20Sleeping%20Prince%20%28play%29">The Sleeping Prince</a>" and "<a href="Separate%20Tables">Separate Tables</a>". The following year he worked with Olivier again, playing Buckingham to Olivier's Richard in the <a href="Richard%20III%20%281955%20film%29">1955 film</a> of "Richard III". Olivier, who directed, was exasperated at his old friend's insistence on playing the role sympathetically.

Richardson turned down the role of Estragon in Peter Hall's premiere of the English language version of <a href="Samuel%20Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a>'s "<a href="Waiting%20for%20Godot">Waiting for Godot</a>" in 1955 and later reproached himself for missing the chance to be in "the greatest play of my generation". He had consulted Gielgud, who dismissed the piece as rubbish, and even after discussing the play with the author, Richardson could not understand the play or the character. Richardson's "<a href="Timon%20of%20Athens">Timon of Athens</a>" in his 1956 return to the Old Vic was well received, as was his Broadway appearance in "<a href="The%20Waltz%20of%20the%20Toreadors">The Waltz of the Toreadors</a>" for which he was nominated for a <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a> in 1957. He concluded the 1950s with two contrasting West End successes, <a href="Robert%20Bolt">Robert Bolt</a>'s "Flowering Cherry", and <a href="Graham%20Greene">Graham Greene</a>'s "The Complaisant Lover". The former, a sad piece about a failed and deluded insurance manager, ran for 435 performances in 1957–58; Richardson co-starred with three leading ladies in succession: Celia Johnson, Wendy Hiller and his wife. Greene's comedy was a surprise hit, running for 402 performances from June 1959. Throughout rehearsals the cast treated the love-triangle theme as one of despair, and were astonished to find themselves playing to continual laughter. During the run, Richardson worked by day on another Greene work, the film "<a href="Our%20Man%20in%20Havana%20%28film%29">Our Man in Havana</a>". Alec Guinness, who played the main role, noted "the object-lesson in upstaging in the last scene between Richardson and <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a>", faithfully captured by the director, Carol Reed.

Richardson began the 1960s with a failure. <a href="Enid%20Bagnold">Enid Bagnold</a>'s play "The Last Joke" was savaged by the critics ("a meaningless jumble of pretentious whimsy" was one description). His only reason for playing in the piece was the chance of acting with Gielgud, but both men quickly regretted their involvement. Richardson then went to the US to appear in <a href="Sidney%20Lumet">Sidney Lumet</a>'s <a href="Long%20Day%27s%20Journey%20into%20Night%20%281962%20film%29">film adaptation</a> of "<a href="Long%20Day%27s%20Journey%20into%20Night">Long Day's Journey into Night</a>", alongside <a href="Katharine%20Hepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a>. Lumet later recalled how little guidance Richardson needed. Once, the director went into lengthy detail about the playing of a scene, and when he had finished, Richardson said, "Ah, I think I know what you want – a little more flute and a little less cello". After that, Lumet was sparing with suggestions. Richardson was jointly awarded the <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>'s <a href="Best%20Actor%20Award%20%28Cannes%20Film%20Festival%29">Best Actor</a> prize with his co-stars <a href="Jason%20Robards">Jason Robards Jr</a> and <a href="Dean%20Stockwell">Dean Stockwell</a>.

Richardson's next stage role was in a starry revival of "The School for Scandal", as Sir Peter Teazle, directed by Gielgud in 1962. The production was taken on a North American tour, in which Gielgud joined the cast as, he said, "the oldest Joseph Surface in the business". A revival of "<a href="Six%20Characters%20in%20Search%20of%20an%20Author">Six Characters in Search of an Author</a>" in 1963 was judged by the critic <a href="Sheridan%20Morley">Sheridan Morley</a> to have been a high-point of the actor's work in the 1960s. Richardson joined a <a href="British%20Council">British Council</a> tour of South Africa and Europe the following year; he played Bottom again, and <a href="Shylock">Shylock</a> in "The Merchant of Venice".
For his next four stage productions, Richardson was at the Haymarket. "Father Carving a Statue" (1964) by Graham Greene was short-lived. He had a more reliable vehicle in Shaw's "<a href="You%20Never%20Can%20Tell%20%28play%29">You Never Can Tell</a>" (1966) in which he played the philosopher-waiter William, and in the same year he had a great success as Sir Anthony Absolute in "<a href="The%20Rivals">The Rivals</a>". The critic <a href="David%20Benedictus">David Benedictus</a> wrote of Richardson's performance, "...he is choleric and gouty certainly, the script demands that he shall be, but his most engaging quality, his love for his son in spite of himself, shines through every line." In 1967 he again played Shylock; this was the last time he acted in a Shakespeare play on stage. His performance won critical praise, but the rest of the cast were less well received.

Interspersed with his stage plays, Richardson made thirteen cinema films during the decade. On screen he played historical figures including <a href="Edward%20Carson">Sir Edward Carson</a> ("<a href="Oscar%20Wilde%20%28film%29">Oscar Wilde</a>", 1960), <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">WEGladstone</a> ("<a href="Khartoum%20%28film%29">Khartoum</a>", 1966) and <a href="Edward%20Grey%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Grey%20of%20Fallodon">Sir Edward Grey</a> ("<a href="Oh%21%20What%20a%20Lovely%20War">Oh! What a Lovely War</a>", 1969). He was scrupulous about historical accuracy in his portrayals, and researched eras and characters in great detail before filming. Occasionally his precision was greater than directors wished, as when, in "Khartoum", he insisted on wearing a small black finger-stall because the real Gladstone had worn one following an injury. After a role playing a disabled tycoon and <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a>'s father in "<a href="Woman%20of%20Straw">Woman of Straw</a>", in 1965 he played Alexander Gromeko in Lean's "<a href="Doctor%20Zhivago%20%28film%29">Doctor Zhivago</a>", an exceptionally successful film at the box office, which, together with "<a href="The%20Wrong%20Box">The Wrong Box</a>" and "Khartoum", earned him a BAFTA nomination for best leading actor in 1966. Other film roles from this period included Lord Fortnum ("<a href="The%20Bed%20Sitting%20Room%20%28film%29">The Bed Sitting Room</a>", 1969) and Leclerc ("<a href="The%20Looking%20Glass%20War%20%28film%29">The Looking Glass War</a>", 1969). The casts of "Oh! What a Lovely War" and "Khartoum" included Olivier, but he and Richardson did not appear in the same scenes, and never met during the filming. Olivier was by now running the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">National Theatre</a>, temporarily based at the Old Vic, but showed little desire to recruit his former colleague for any of the company's productions.

In 1964 Richardson was the voice of <a href="Douglas%20Haig%2C%201st%20Earl%20Haig">General Haig</a> in the twenty-six-part BBC documentary series "<a href="The%20Great%20War%20%28documentary%29">The Great War</a>". In 1967 he played <a href="Lord%20Emsworth">Lord Emsworth</a> on BBC television in dramatisations of <a href="P.%20G.%20Wodehouse">PGWodehouse</a>'s Blandings Castle stories, with his wife playing Emsworth's bossy sister Constance, and <a href="Stanley%20Holloway">Stanley Holloway</a> as the butler, Beach. He was nervous about acting in a television series: "I'm sixty-four and that's a bit old to be taking on a new medium." The performances divided critical opinion. "The Times" thought the stars "a sheer delight... situation comedy is joy in their hands". The reviewers in "The Guardian" and "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" thought the three too theatrical to be effective on the small screen. For television he recorded studio versions of two plays in which he had appeared on stage: "Johnson Over Jordan" (1965) and "Twelfth Night" (1968).

During the decade, Richardson made numerous sound recordings. For the <a href="Caedmon%20Audio">Caedmon Audio</a> label he re-created his role as "Cyrano de Bergerac" opposite <a href="Anna%20Massey">Anna Massey</a> as Roxane, and played the title role in a complete recording of "Julius Caesar", with a cast that included <a href="Anthony%20Quayle">Anthony Quayle</a> as Brutus, <a href="John%20Mills">John Mills</a> as Cassius and <a href="Alan%20Bates">Alan Bates</a> as Antony. Other Caedmon recordings were "<a href="Measure%20for%20Measure">Measure for Measure</a>", "The School for Scandal" and "No Man's Land". Richardson also recorded some English Romantic poetry, including "<a href="The%20Rime%20of%20the%20Ancient%20Mariner">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a>" and poems by <a href="John%20Keats">Keats</a> and <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Shelley</a> for the label. For <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca Records</a> Richardson recorded the narration for <a href="Sergei%20Prokofiev">Prokofiev</a>'s "<a href="Peter%20and%20the%20Wolf">Peter and the Wolf</a>", and for <a href="RCA%20Records">RCA</a> the superscriptions for <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Vaughan Williams</a>'s "<a href="Sinfonia%20antartica">Sinfonia antartica</a>" – both with the <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a>, the Prokofiev conducted by <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Sir Malcolm Sargent</a> and the Vaughan Williams by <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Previn">André Previn</a>.

Richardson's last stage role of the decade was in 1969, as Dr Rance in "<a href="What%20the%20Butler%20Saw%20%28play%29">What the Butler Saw</a>" by <a href="Joe%20Orton">Joe Orton</a>. It was a conspicuous failure. The public hated the play and made the fact vociferously clear at the first night.

In 1970 Richardson was with Gielgud at the Royal Court in David Storey's "<a href="Home%20%28play%29">Home</a>". The play is set in the gardens of a nursing home for mental patients, though this is not clear at first. The two elderly men converse in a desultory way, are joined and briefly enlivened by two more extrovert female patients, are slightly scared by another male patient, and are then left together, conversing even more emptily. The "<a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>" critic, Jeremy Kingston wrote:

The play transferred to the West End and then to Broadway. In "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" <a href="Clive%20Barnes">Clive Barnes</a> wrote, "The two men, bleakly examining the little nothingness of their lives, are John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson giving two of the greatest performances of two careers that have been among the glories of the English-speaking theater." The original cast recorded the play for television in 1972.

Back at the Royal Court in 1971 Richardson starred in <a href="John%20Osborne">John Osborne</a>'s "West of Suez", after which, in July 1972, he surprised many by joining Peggy Ashcroft in a drawing-room comedy, "<a href="Lloyd%20George%20Knew%20My%20Father%20%28play%29">Lloyd George Knew My Father</a>" by <a href="William%20Douglas-Home">William Douglas-Home</a>. Some critics felt the play was too slight for its two stars, but Harold Hobson thought Richardson found unsuspected depths in the character of the ostensibly phlegmatic General Boothroyd. The play was a hit with the public, and when Ashcroft left after four months, Celia Johnson took over until May 1973, when Richardson handed over to <a href="Andrew%20Cruickshank">Andrew Cruickshank</a> in the West End. Richardson afterwards toured the play in Australia and Canada with his wife as co-star. An Australian critic wrote, "The play is a vehicle for Sir Ralph... but the real driver is Lady Richardson."

Richardson's film roles of the early 1970s ranged from the Crypt Keeper in "<a href="Tales%20from%20the%20Crypt%20%28film%29">Tales from the Crypt</a>" (1972) to the Caterpillar in "<a href="Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland%20%281972%20film%29">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a>" (1972) and Dr Rank in <a href="Henrik%20Ibsen">Ibsen</a>'s "<a href="A%20Doll%27s%20House%20%281973%20Garland%20film%29">A Doll's House</a>" (1973). The last of these was released at the same time as an American film of <a href="A%20Doll%27s%20House%20%281973%20Losey%20film%29">the same play</a>, starring <a href="Jane%20Fonda">Jane Fonda</a>; the timing detracted from the impact of both versions, but Richardson's performance won good reviews. In "The Observer", <a href="George%20Melly">George Melly</a> wrote, "As for Sir Ralph as Dr Rank, he grows from the ageing elegant cynic of his first appearance (it's even a pleasure to watch him remove his top hat) to become the heroic dying stoic of his final exit without in any way forcing the pace." In 1973 Richardson received a BAFTA nomination for his performance of <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George IV</a> in "<a href="Lady%20Caroline%20Lamb%20%28film%29">Lady Caroline Lamb</a>", in which Olivier appeared as <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Wellington</a>.

Peter Hall, having succeeded Olivier as director of the National Theatre, was determined to attract Ashcroft, Gielgud and Richardson into the company. In 1975 he successfully offered Richardson the title role in Ibsen's "<a href="John%20Gabriel%20Borkman">John Gabriel Borkman</a>", with Ashcroft and Wendy Hiller in the two main female roles. The production was one of the early successes of Hall's initially difficult tenure. The critic <a href="Michael%20Billington%20%28critic%29">Michael Billington</a> wrote that Hall had done the impossible in reconciling the contradictory aspects of the play and that "Richardson's Borkman is both moral monster and self-made superman; and the performance is full of a strange, unearthly music that belongs to this actor alone."
Richardson continued his long stage association with Gielgud in <a href="Harold%20Pinter">Harold Pinter</a>'s "<a href="No%20Man%27s%20Land%20%28play%29">No Man's Land</a>" (1975) directed by Hall at the National. Gielgud played Spooner, a down-at-heel sponger and opportunist, and Richardson was Hirst, a prosperous but isolated and vulnerable author. There is both comedy and pain in the piece: the critic <a href="Michael%20Coveney">Michael Coveney</a> called their performance "the funniest double-act in town", but Peter Hall said of Richardson, "I do not think any other actor could fill Hirst with such a sense of loneliness and creativity as Ralph does. The production was a critical and box-office success, and played at the Old Vic, in the West End, at the <a href="Lyttelton%20Theatre">Lyttelton Theatre</a> in the new National Theatre complex, on Broadway and on television, over a period of three years.

After "No Man's Land", Richardson once again turned to light comedy by Douglas-Home, from whom he commissioned "The Kingfisher". A story of an old love affair rekindled, it opened with Celia Johnson as the female lead. It ran for six months, and would have lasted much longer had Johnson not withdrawn, leaving Richardson unwilling to rehearse the piece with anyone else. He returned to the National, and to Chekhov, in 1978 as the aged retainer Firs in "<a href="The%20Cherry%20Orchard">The Cherry Orchard</a>". The notices for the production were mixed; those for Richardson's next West End play were uniformly dreadful. This was "Alice's Boys", a spy and murder piece generally agreed to be preposterous. A legend, possibly apocryphal, grew that during the short run Richardson walked to the front of the stage one night and asked, "Is there a doctor in the house?" A doctor stood up, and Richardson sadly said to him, "Doctor, isn't this a terrible play?"

After this débâcle the rest of Richardson's stage career was at the National, with one late exception. He played Lord Touchwood in "<a href="The%20Double%20Dealer">The Double Dealer</a>" (1978), the Master in "<a href="The%20Fruits%20of%20Enlightenment">The Fruits of Enlightenment</a>" (1979), Old Ekdal in "<a href="The%20Wild%20Duck">The Wild Duck</a>" (1979) and Kitchen in Storey's "Early Days", specially written for him. The last toured in North America after the London run. His final West End play was "The Understanding" (1982), a gentle comedy of late-flowering love. Celia Johnson was cast as his co-star, but died suddenly just before the first night. <a href="Joan%20Greenwood">Joan Greenwood</a> stepped into the breach, but the momentum of the production had gone, and it closed after eight weeks.

Films in which Richardson appeared in the later 1970s and early 1980s include "<a href="Rollerball%20%281975%20film%29">Rollerball</a>" (1975), "<a href="The%20Man%20in%20the%20Iron%20Mask%20%281977%20film%29">The Man in the Iron Mask</a>" (1977), "<a href="Dragonslayer%20%281981%20film%29">Dragonslayer</a>" (1981) in which he played a wizard and "<a href="Time%20Bandits">Time Bandits</a>" (1981) in which he played the Supreme Being. In 1983 he was seen as Pfordten in <a href="Tony%20Palmer">Tony Palmer</a>'s "<a href="Wagner%20%28film%29">Wagner</a>"; this was a film of enormous length, starring <a href="Richard%20Burton">Richard Burton</a> as <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a> and was noted at the time, and subsequently, for the cameo roles of three conspiratorial courtiers, played by Gielgud, Olivier and Richardson – the only film in which the three played scenes together. For television, Richardson played <a href="Simeon%20%28Gospel%20of%20Luke%29">Simeon</a> in "<a href="Jesus%20of%20Nazareth%20%28miniseries%29">Jesus of Nazareth</a>" (1977), made studio recordings of "No Man's Land" (1978) and "Early Days" (1982), and was a guest in the 1981 <a href="Morecambe%20and%20Wise">Morecambe and Wise</a> Christmas Show. His last radio broadcast was in 1982 in a documentary programme about <a href="Little%20Tich">Little Tich</a>, whom he had watched at the <a href="Brighton%20Hippodrome">Brighton Hippodrome</a> before the First World War.

Richardson's final role was Don Alberto in "Inner Voices" by <a href="Eduardo%20De%20Filippo">Eduardo De Filippo</a> at the National in 1983. The direction was criticised by reviewers, but Richardson's performance won high praise. He played an old man who denounces the next-door family for murder and then realises he dreamt it but cannot persuade the police that he was wrong. Both "Punch" and "The New York Times" found his performance "mesmerising". After the London run the piece was scheduled to go on tour in October. Just before that, Richardson suffered a series of strokes, from which he died on 10 October, at the age of eighty. All the theatres in London dimmed their lights in tribute; the funeral <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a> was at Richardson's favourite church, the <a href="Church%20of%20our%20Lady%20of%20the%20Assumption%20and%20St%20Gregory%2C%20Westminster">Church of our Lady of the Assumption and St Gregory</a>, in <a href="Soho">Soho</a>; he was buried in <a href="Highgate%20Cemetery">Highgate Cemetery</a>; and the following month there was a memorial service in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>.

Richardson's last films – one for television and two for the cinema – were released after his death. These were "<a href="Witness%20for%20the%20Prosecution%20%281982%20film%29">Witness for the Prosecution</a>", in which he played the barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts, co-starring with <a href="Deborah%20Kerr">Deborah Kerr</a> and <a href="Diana%20Rigg">Diana Rigg</a>;" <a href="Give%20My%20Regards%20to%20Broad%20Street%20%28film%29">Give My Regards to Broad Street</a>", with <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>; and "", a retelling of the <a href="Tarzan">Tarzan</a> story. In the last, Richardson played the stern old Lord Greystoke, rejuvenated in his latter days by his lost grandson, reclaimed from the wild; he was posthumously nominated for an <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Award</a>. The film bears the superscription, "Dedicated to Ralph Richardson 1902–1983 – In Loving Memory"

As a man, Richardson was on the one hand deeply private and on the other flamboyantly unconventional. <a href="Frank%20Muir">Frank Muir</a> said of him, "It's the Ralphdom of Ralph that one has to cling to; he wasn't really quite like other people." In Coveney's phrase, "His oddness was ever startling and never hardened into mere eccentricity." Richardson would introduce colleagues to his ferrets by name, ride at high speed on his powerful motor-bike in his seventies, have a parrot flying round his study eating his pencils, or take a pet mouse out for a stroll, but behind such unorthodox behaviour there was a closely guarded self who remained an enigma to even his closest colleagues. Tynan wrote in "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" that Richardson "made me feel that I have known this man all my life and that I have never met anyone who more adroitly buttonholed me while keeping me firmly at arm's length."

Richardson was not known for his political views. He reportedly voted for <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>'s <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> party in 1945, but there is little other mention of party politics in the biographies. Having been a devoted Roman Catholic as a boy, he became disillusioned with religion as a young man, but drifted back to faith: "I came to a kind of feeling I could touch a live wire through prayer". He retained his early love of painting, and listed it and tennis in his "<a href="Who%27s%20Who%20%28UK%29">Who's Who</a>" entry as his recreations.

Peter Hall said of Richardson, "I think he was the greatest actor I have ever worked with." The director David Ayliff, son of Richardson's and Olivier's mentor, said, "Ralph was a natural actor, he couldn't stop being a perfect actor; Olivier did it through sheer hard work and determination." Comparing the two, Hobson said that Olivier always made the audience feel inferior, and Richardson always made them feel superior. The actor <a href="Edward%20Hardwicke">Edward Hardwicke</a> agreed, saying that audiences were in awe of Olivier, "whereas Ralph would always make you feel sympathy... you wanted to give him a big hug. But they were both giants."

Richardson thought himself temperamentally unsuited to the great tragic roles, and most reviewers agreed, but to critics of several generations he was peerless in classic comedies. Kenneth Tynan judged any Falstaff against Richardson's, which he considered "matchless", and Gielgud judged "definitive". Richardson, though hardly ever satisfied with his own performances, evidently believed he had done well as Falstaff. Hall and others tried hard to get him to play the part again, but referring to it he said, "Those things I've done in which I've succeeded a little bit, I'd hate to do again."
A leading actor of a younger generation, <a href="Albert%20Finney">Albert Finney</a>, has said that Richardson was not really an actor at all, but a magician. Miller, who interviewed many of Richardson's colleagues for his 1995 biography, notes that when talking about Richardson's acting, "magical" was a word many of them used. "The Guardian" judged Richardson "indisputably our most poetic actor". For "The Times", he "was ideally equipped to make an ordinary character seem extraordinary or an extraordinary one seem ordinary". He himself touched on this dichotomy in his variously reported comments that acting was "merely the art of keeping a large group of people from coughing" or, alternatively, "dreaming to order".

Tynan, who could be brutally critical when he thought Richardson miscast, nevertheless thought there was something godlike about him, "should you imagine the Almighty to be a whimsical, enigmatic magician, capable of fearful blunders, sometimes inexplicably ferocious, at other times dazzling in his innocence and benignity". Harold Hobson wrote, "Sir Ralph is an actor who, whatever his failure in heroic parts, however short of tragic grandeur his Othello or his Macbeth may have fallen, has nevertheless, in unromantic tweeds and provincial hats, received a revelation. There are more graceful players than he upon the stage; there is none who has been so touched by Grace."

Jorge Mario Pedro Vargas Llosa, 1st Marquis of Vargas Llosa (born March 28, 1936), more commonly known as Mario Vargas Llosa (; ), is a Peruvian-Spanish writer, politician, journalist, essayist and college professor. Vargas Llosa is one of Latin America's most significant novelists and essayists, and one of the leading writers of his generation. Some critics consider him to have had a larger international impact and worldwide audience than any other writer of the <a href="Latin%20American%20Boom">Latin American Boom</a>. In 2010 he won the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a>, "for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat."

Vargas Llosa rose to fame in the 1960s with novels such as "<a href="The%20Time%20of%20the%20Hero">The Time of the Hero</a>" ("La ciudad y los perros", literally "The City and the Dogs", 1963/1966), "<a href="The%20Green%20House">The Green House</a>" ("La casa verde", 1965/1968), and the monumental "<a href="Conversation%20in%20the%20Cathedral">Conversation in the Cathedral</a>" ("Conversación en la catedral", 1969/1975). He writes prolifically across an array of <a href="literary%20genre">literary genre</a>s, including <a href="literary%20criticism">literary criticism</a> and journalism. His novels include comedies, murder mysteries, historical novels, and political thrillers. Several, such as "<a href="Captain%20Pantoja%20and%20the%20Special%20Service">Captain Pantoja and the Special Service</a>" (1973/1978) and "<a href="Aunt%20Julia%20and%20the%20Scriptwriter">Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter</a>" (1977/1982), have been adapted as feature films.

Many of Vargas Llosa's works are influenced by the writer's perception of <a href="Peru">Peru</a>vian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian. Increasingly, however, he has expanded his range, and tackled themes that arise from other parts of the world. In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world. Another change over the course of his career has been a shift from a style and approach associated with <a href="Modernist%20literature">literary modernism</a>, to a sometimes playful <a href="postmodernism">postmodernism</a>.

Like many Latin American writers, Vargas Llosa has been politically active throughout his career; over the course of his life, he has gradually moved from the <a href="political%20left">political left</a> towards more right-wing <a href="liberalism">liberalism</a>. While he initially supported the Cuban revolutionary government of <a href="Fidel%20Castro">Fidel Castro</a>, Vargas Llosa later became disenchanted with its policies, particularly after the imprisonment of Cuban poet <a href="Heberto%20Padilla">Heberto Padilla</a> in 1971. He ran for the <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20Peru">Peruvian presidency</a> in <a href="Peruvian%20general%20election%2C%201990">1990</a> with the center-right "<a href="Democratic%20Front%20%28Peru%29">Frente Democrático</a>" coalition, advocating <a href="Classical%20liberalism">classical liberal</a> reforms, but lost the election to <a href="Alberto%20Fujimori">Alberto Fujimori</a>. He is the person who, in 1990, "coined the phrase that circled the globe," declaring on Mexican television, "Mexico is the perfect dictatorship," a statement which became an adage during the following decade.

Mario Vargas Llosa was born to a middle-class family on March 28, 1936, in the southern <a href="Peru">Peru</a>vian provincial city of <a href="Arequipa">Arequipa</a>. He was the only child of Ernesto Vargas Maldonado and Dora Llosa Ureta (the former a radio operator in an aviation company, the latter the daughter of an old <a href="Criollo%20%28people%29">criollo</a> family), who separated a few months before his birth. Shortly after Mario's birth, his father revealed that he was having an affair with a German woman; consequently, Mario has two younger half-brothers: Enrique and Ernesto Vargas.

Vargas Llosa lived with his maternal family in Arequipa until a year after his parents' divorce, when his maternal grandfather was named <a href="honorary%20consul">honorary consul</a> for Peru in <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>. With his mother and her family, Vargas Llosa then moved to <a href="Cochabamba">Cochabamba</a>, Bolivia, where he spent the early years of his childhood. His maternal family, the Llosas, were sustained by his grandfather, who managed a cotton farm. As a child, Vargas Llosa was led to believe that his father had died—his mother and her family did not want to explain that his parents had separated. During the government of Peruvian President <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Bustamante%20y%20Rivero">José Bustamante y Rivero</a>, Vargas Llosa's maternal grandfather obtained a diplomatic post in the northern Peruvian coastal city of <a href="Piura">Piura</a> and the entire family returned to Peru. While in Piura, Vargas Llosa attended elementary school at the religious academy "Colegio <a href="Salesian">Salesian</a>o". In 1946, at the age of ten, he moved to <a href="Lima">Lima</a> and met his father for the first time. His parents re-established their relationship and lived in <a href="Magdalena%20del%20Mar">Magdalena del Mar</a>, a middle-class Lima suburb, during his teenage years. While in Lima, he studied at the "Colegio La Salle", a Christian middle school, from 1947 to 1949.

When Vargas Llosa was fourteen, his father sent him to the <a href="Leoncio%20Prado%20Military%20Academy">Leoncio Prado Military Academy</a> in Lima. At the age of 16, before his graduation, Vargas Llosa began working as an amateur journalist for local newspapers. He withdrew from the military academy and finished his studies in Piura, where he worked for the local newspaper, "La Industria", and witnessed the theatrical performance of his first dramatic work, "La huida del Inca".

In 1953, during the government of <a href="Manuel%20A.%20Odr%C3%ADa">Manuel A. Odría</a>, Vargas Llosa enrolled in Lima's <a href="National%20University%20of%20San%20Marcos">National University of San Marcos</a>, to study law and literature. He married <a href="Julia%20Urquidi">Julia Urquidi</a>, his maternal uncle's sister-in-law, in 1955 at the age of 19; she was 10 years older. Vargas Llosa began his literary career in earnest in 1957 with the publication of his first short stories, "The Leaders" ("Los jefes") and "The Grandfather" ("El abuelo"), while working for two Peruvian newspapers. Upon his graduation from the National University of San Marcos in 1958, he received a scholarship to study at the <a href="Complutense%20University%20of%20Madrid">Complutense University of Madrid</a> in Spain. In 1960, after his scholarship in Madrid had expired, Vargas Llosa moved to France under the impression that he would receive a scholarship to study there; however, upon arriving in Paris, he learned that his scholarship request was denied. Despite Mario and Julia's unexpected financial status, the couple decided to remain in Paris where he began to write prolifically. Their marriage lasted only a few more years, ending in divorce in 1964. A year later, Vargas Llosa <a href="Cousin%20marriage">married his first cousin</a>, Patricia Llosa, with whom he had three children: <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Vargas%20Llosa">Álvaro Vargas Llosa</a> (born 1966), a writer and editor; Gonzalo (born 1967), an international civil servant; and Morgana (born 1974), a photographer. As of 2015, he is in a relationship with Filipina Spanish socialite and TV personality <a href="Isabel%20Preysler">Isabel Preysler</a> and seeking a divorce from Patricia Llosa. He is an atheist.

Vargas Llosa's first novel, "<a href="The%20Time%20of%20the%20Hero">The Time of the Hero</a>" ("La ciudad y los perros"), was published in 1963. The book is set among a community of cadets in a Lima military school, and the plot is based on the author's own experiences at Lima's <a href="Leoncio%20Prado%20Military%20Academy">Leoncio Prado Military Academy</a>. This early piece gained wide public attention and immediate success. Its vitality and adept use of sophisticated literary techniques immediately impressed critics, and it won the "<a href="Premio%20de%20la%20Cr%C3%ADtica%20Espa%C3%B1ola">Premio de la Crítica Española</a>" award. Nevertheless, its sharp criticism of the Peruvian military establishment led to controversy in Peru. Several Peruvian generals attacked the novel, claiming that it was the work of a "degenerate mind" and stating that Vargas Llosa was "paid by Ecuador" to undermine the prestige of the Peruvian Army.

In 1965, Vargas Llosa published his second novel, "<a href="The%20Green%20House">The Green House</a>" ("La casa verde"), about a brothel called "The Green House" and how its quasi-mythical presence affects the lives of the characters. The main plot follows Bonifacia, a girl who is about to receive the vows of the church, and her transformation into "la Selvatica", the best-known prostitute of "The Green House". The novel was immediately acclaimed, confirming Vargas Llosa as an important voice of Latin American narrative. "The Green House" won the first edition of the <a href="R%C3%B3mulo%20Gallegos%20Prize">Rómulo Gallegos International Novel Prize</a> in 1967, contending with works by veteran <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>an writer <a href="Juan%20Carlos%20Onetti">Juan Carlos Onetti</a> and by <a href="Gabriel%20Garc%C3%ADa%20M%C3%A1rquez">Gabriel García Márquez</a>. This novel alone accumulated enough awards to place the author among the leading figures of the <a href="Latin%20American%20Boom">Latin American Boom</a>. Some critics still consider "The Green House" to be Vargas Llosa's finest and most important achievement. Indeed, Latin American literary critic <a href="Gerald%20Martin">Gerald Martin</a> suggests that "The Green House" is "one of the greatest novels to have emerged from Latin America".

Vargas Llosa's third novel, "<a href="Conversation%20in%20the%20Cathedral">Conversation in the Cathedral</a>" ("Conversación en la catedral"), was published in 1969, when he was 33. This ambitious narrative is the story of Santiago Zavala, the son of a government minister, and Ambrosio, his chauffeur. A random meeting at a <a href="dog%20pound">dog pound</a> leads the pair to a riveting conversation at a nearby bar known as "The Cathedral". During the encounter, Zavala searches for the truth about his father's role in the murder of a notorious Peruvian underworld figure, shedding light on the workings of a dictatorship along the way. Unfortunately for Zavala, his quest results in a dead end with no answers and no sign of a better future. The novel attacks the dictatorial government of Odría by showing how a dictatorship controls and destroys lives. The persistent theme of hopelessness makes "Conversation in the Cathedral" Vargas Llosa's most bitter novel.

He lectured Spanish American Literature at <a href="King%27s%20College%20London">King's College London</a> from 1969 to 1970.

In 1971, Vargas Llosa published "García Márquez: Story of a Deicide" ("García Márquez: historia de un deicidio"), which was his doctoral thesis for the Complutense University of Madrid. Although Vargas Llosa wrote this book-length study about his then friend, the Colombian <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel laureate</a> writer Gabriel García Márquez, they did not speak to each other again. In 1976, Vargas Llosa punched García Márquez in the face in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a> at the "<a href="Palacio%20de%20Bellas%20Artes">Palacio de Bellas Artes</a>", ending the friendship. Neither writer had publicly stated the underlying reasons for the quarrel. A photograph of García Márquez sporting a black eye was published in 2007, reigniting public interest in the feud. Despite the decades of silence, in 2007, Vargas Llosa agreed to allow part of his book to be used as the introduction to a 40th-anniversary edition of García Márquez's "<a href="One%20Hundred%20Years%20of%20Solitude">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a>", which was re-released in Spain and throughout Latin America that year. "Historia de un Deicidio" was also reissued in that year, as part of Vargas Llosa's complete works.

Following the monumental work "Conversation in the Cathedral", Vargas Llosa's output shifted away from more serious themes such as politics and problems with society. Latin American literary scholar Raymond L. Williams describes this phase in his writing career as "the discovery of humor". His first attempt at a satirical novel was "Captain Pantoja and the Special Service" ("Pantaleón y las visitadoras"), published in 1973. This short, comic novel offers vignettes of dialogues and documents about the Peruvian armed forces and a corps of prostitutes assigned to visit military outposts in remote jungle areas. These plot elements are similar to Vargas Llosa's earlier novel "The Green House", but in a different form. "Captain Pantoja and the Special Service" is, therefore, essentially a <a href="parody">parody</a> of both "The Green House" and the literary approach that novel represents. Vargas Llosa's motivation to write the novel came from actually witnessing prostitutes being hired by the Peruvian Army and brought to serve soldiers in the jungle.

From 1974 to 1987, Vargas Llosa focused on his writing, but also took the time to pursue other endeavors. In 1975, he co-directed an unsuccessful motion-picture adaptation of his novel, "Captain Pantoja and the Secret Service". In 1976 he was elected President of <a href="PEN%20International">PEN International</a>, the worldwide association of writers and oldest human rights organisation, a position he held until 1979. During this time, Vargas Llosa constantly traveled to speak at conferences organized by international institutions such as the <a href="Hebrew%20University%20of%20Jerusalem">Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, where he was Simón Bolívar Professor and an Overseas Fellow of <a href="Churchill%20College">Churchill College</a> in 1977–78.

In 1977, Vargas Llosa was elected as a member of the <a href="Academia%20Peruana%20de%20la%20Lengua">Peruvian Academy of Language</a>, a membership he still holds today. That year, he also published "<a href="Aunt%20Julia%20and%20the%20Scriptwriter">Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter</a>" ("La tía Julia y el escribidor"), based in part on his marriage to his first wife, Julia Urquidi, to whom he dedicated the novel. She later wrote a memoir, "Lo que Varguitas no dijo" ("What Little Vargas Didn't Say"), in which she gives her personal account of their relationship. She states that Vargas Llosa's account exaggerates many negative points in their courtship and marriage while minimizing her role of assisting his literary career. "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter" is considered one of the most striking examples of how the language and imagery of popular culture can be used in literature. The novel was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, "<a href="Tune%20in%20Tomorrow">Tune in Tomorrow</a>".

Vargas Llosa's fourth major novel, "<a href="The%20War%20of%20the%20End%20of%20the%20World">The War of the End of the World</a>" ("La guerra del fin del mundo"), was published in 1981 and was his first attempt at a <a href="historical%20novel">historical novel</a>. This work initiated a radical change in Vargas Llosa's style towards themes such as <a href="messianism">messianism</a> and irrational human behaviour. It recreates the <a href="War%20of%20Canudos">War of Canudos</a>, an incident in 19th-century Brazil in which an armed <a href="millenarian">millenarian</a> cult held off a siege by the national army for months. As in Vargas Llosa's earliest work, this novel carries a sober and serious theme, and its tone is dark. Vargas Llosa's bold exploration of humanity's propensity to idealize violence, and his account of a man-made catastrophe brought on by fanaticism on all sides, earned the novel substantial recognition.
Because of the book's ambition and execution, critics have argued that this is one of Vargas Llosa's greatest literary pieces.
Even though the novel has been acclaimed in Brazil, it was initially poorly received because a foreigner was writing about a Brazilian theme. The book was also criticized as revolutionary and anti-socialist. Vargas Llosa says that this book is his favorite and was his most difficult accomplishment.

After completing "The War of the End of the World", Vargas Llosa began to write novels that were significantly shorter than many of his earlier books. In 1983, he finished "The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta" ("Historia de Mayta", 1984). The novel focuses on a leftist insurrection that took place on May 29, 1962 in the <a href="Andes">Andean</a> city of <a href="Jauja">Jauja</a>. Later the same year, during the <a href="Sendero%20Luminoso">Sendero Luminoso</a> uprising, Vargas Llosa was asked by the Peruvian President <a href="Fernando%20Bela%C3%BAnde%20Terry">Fernando Belaúnde Terry</a> to join the Investigatory Commission, a task force to inquire into the massacre of eight journalists at the hands of the villagers of <a href="Uchuraccay">Uchuraccay</a>. The Commission's main purpose was to investigate the murders in order to provide information regarding the incident to the public. Following his involvement with the Investigatory Commission, Vargas Llosa published a series of articles to defend his position in the affair. In 1986, he completed his next novel, "Who Killed Palomino Molero" ("¿Quién mató a Palomino Molero?"), which he began writing shortly after the end of the Uchuraccay investigation. Though the plot of this <a href="Mystery%20%28fiction%29">mystery novel</a> is similar to the tragic events at Uchuraccay, literary critic Roy Boland points out that it was not an attempt to reconstruct the murders, but rather a "literary exorcism" of Vargas Llosa's own experiences during the commission. The experience also inspired one of Vargas Llosa's later novels, "<a href="Death%20in%20the%20Andes">Death in the Andes</a>" ("Lituma en los Andes"), originally published in 1993 in Barcelona.

It would be almost 20 years before Vargas Llosa wrote another major work: "<a href="The%20Feast%20of%20the%20Goat">The Feast of the Goat</a>" ("La fiesta del chivo"), a <a href="political%20thriller">political thriller</a>, was published in 2000 (and in English in 2001). According to Williams, it is Vargas Llosa's most complete and most ambitious novel since "The War of the End of the World". Critic Sabine Koellmann sees it in the line of his earlier novels such as "Conversación en la catedral" depicting the effects of authoritarianism, violence and the abuse of power on the individual. Based on the dictatorship of <a href="Rafael%20Trujillo">Rafael Trujillo</a>, who governed the <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a> from 1930 until his assassination in 1961, the novel has three main strands: one concerns Urania Cabral, the daughter of a former politician and Trujillo loyalist, who returns for the first time since leaving the Dominican Republic after Trujillo's assassination 30 years earlier; the second concentrates on the assassination itself, the conspirators who carry it out, and its consequences; and the third and final strand deals with Trujillo himself in scenes from the end of his regime. The book quickly received positive reviews in Spain and Latin America, and has had a significant impact in Latin America, being regarded as one of Vargas Llosa's best works.

In 1995, he wrote and published a children's book called "Hitos y Mitos Literarios" ("The Milestones and the Stories of Greatest Literary Works"), illustrated by <a href="Willi%20Glasauer">Willi Glasauer</a>. The book includes fun facts, trivia, and information accompanied by photos and <a href="Willi%20Glasauer">Willi Glasauer</a>'s illustrations of the likes of "<a href="Brave%20New%20World">Brave New World</a>" by <a href="Aldous%20Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a>, "<a href="Manhattan%20Transfer%20%28novel%29">Manhattan Transfer</a>" by <a href="John%20Dos%20Passos">John Dos Passos</a>, "<a href="The%20Stranger%20%28Camus%20novel%29">The Stranger</a>" by <a href="Albert%20Camus">Albert Camus</a>, "<a href="Lolita">Lolita</a>" by <a href="Vladimir%20Nabokov">Vladimir Nabokov</a>, "<a href="One%20Day%20in%20the%20Life%20of%20Ivan%20Denisovich">One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</a>" by <a href="Aleksandr%20Solzhenitsyn">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</a>, "<a href="Death%20in%20Venice">Death in Venice</a>" by <a href="Thomas%20Mann">Thomas Mann</a>, "<a href="The%20Great%20Gatsby">The Great Gatsby</a>" by <a href="F.%20Scott%20Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>, "<a href="Herzog%20%28novel%29">Herzog</a>" by <a href="Saul%20Bellow">Saul Bellow</a>, "<a href="East%20of%20Eden%20%28novel%29">East of Eden</a>" by <a href="John%20Steinbeck">John Steinbeck</a>, "<a href="Steppenwolf%20%28novel%29">Steppenwolf</a>" by <a href="Hermann%20Hesse">Hermann Hesse</a>, and "<a href="A%20Moveable%20Feast">A Moveable Feast</a>" by <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>.

In 2003 he wrote "<a href="The%20Way%20to%20Paradise">The Way to Paradise</a>" in which he studies <a href="Flora%20Tristan">Flora Tristan</a> and <a href="Paul%20Gauguin">Paul Gauguin</a>.

In 2006, Vargas Llosa wrote "<a href="The%20Bad%20Girl">The Bad Girl</a>" ("Travesuras de la niña mala"), which journalist Kathryn Harrison argues is a rewrite (rather than simply a recycling) of <a href="Gustave%20Flaubert">Gustave Flaubert</a>'s "<a href="Madame%20Bovary">Madame Bovary</a>" (1856). In Vargas Llosa's version, the plot relates the decades-long obsession of its narrator, a Peruvian expatriate in Paris, with a woman with whom he first fell in love when both were teenagers.

Like many other Latin American intellectuals, Vargas Llosa was initially a supporter of the <a href="Cuban%20Revolution">Cuban revolutionary</a> government of <a href="Fidel%20Castro">Fidel Castro</a>. He studied <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a> in depth as a university student and was later persuaded by <a href="communism">communist</a> ideals after the success of the Cuban Revolution. Gradually, Vargas Llosa came to believe that <a href="socialism">socialism</a> was incompatible with what he considered to be general liberties and freedoms. The official rupture between the writer and the policies of the Cuban government occurred with the so-called 'Padilla Affair', when the Castro regime imprisoned the poet <a href="Heberto%20Padilla">Heberto Padilla</a> for a month in 1971. Vargas Llosa, along with other intellectuals of the time, wrote to Castro protesting the Cuban political system and its imprisonment of the artist. Vargas Llosa has identified himself with liberalism rather than extreme left-wing political ideologies ever since. Since he relinquished his earlier leftism, he has opposed both left- and right-wing <a href="authoritarian">authoritarian</a> regimes.

With his appointment to the Investigatory Commission on the Uchuraccay massacre in 1983, he experienced what literary critic <a href="Jean%20Franco">Jean Franco</a> calls "the most uncomfortable event in [his] political career". Unfortunately for Vargas Llosa, his involvement with the Investigatory Commission led to immediate negative reactions and defamation from the Peruvian press; many suggested that the massacre was a conspiracy to keep the journalists from reporting the presence of government paramilitary forces in Uchuraccay. The commission concluded that it was the indigenous villagers who had been responsible for the killings; for Vargas Llosa the incident showed "how vulnerable democracy is in Latin America and how easily it dies under dictatorships of the right and left". These conclusions, and Vargas Llosa personally, came under intense criticism: anthropologist Enrique Mayer, for instance, accused him of "paternalism", while fellow anthropologist Carlos Iván Degregori criticized him for his ignorance of the Andean world. Vargas Llosa was accused of actively colluding in a government cover-up of army involvement in the massacre. US <a href="Latin%20American%20literature">Latin American literature</a> scholar Misha Kokotovic summarizes that the novelist was charged with seeing "indigenous cultures as a 'primitive' obstacle to the full realization of his Western model of modernity". Shocked both by the atrocity itself and then by the reaction his report had provoked, Vargas Llosa responded that his critics were apparently more concerned with his report than with the hundreds of peasants who would later die at the hands of the Sendero Luminoso guerrilla organization.
Over the course of the decade, Vargas Llosa became known as a "<a href="neoliberal">neoliberal</a>", although he personally dislikes the term and considers it "pure nonsense" and only used for derision. In 1987, he helped form and soon became a leader of the <a href="Liberty%20Movement">Movimiento Libertad</a>. The following year his party entered a coalition with the parties of Peru's two principal conservative politicians at the time, ex-president <a href="Fernando%20Bela%C3%BAnde%20Terry">Fernando Belaúnde Terry</a> (of the <a href="Popular%20Action%20%28Peru%29">Popular Action</a> party) and <a href="Luis%20Bedoya%20Reyes">Luis Bedoya Reyes</a> (of the "<a href="Partido%20Popular%20Cristiano%20%28Peru%29">Partido Popular Cristiano</a>"), to form the tripartite center-right coalition known as "<a href="Democratic%20Front%20%28Peru%29">Frente Democrático</a>" (FREDEMO). He ran for the <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20Peru">presidency of Peru</a> in 1990 as the candidate of the FREDEMO coalition. He proposed a drastic economic <a href="austerity">austerity</a> program that frightened most of the country's poor; this program emphasized the need for privatization, a market economy, free trade, and most importantly, the dissemination of private property. Although he won the first round with 34% of the vote, Vargas Llosa was defeated by a then-unknown agricultural engineer, <a href="Alberto%20Fujimori">Alberto Fujimori</a>, in the subsequent run-off. Vargas Llosa included an account of his run for the presidency in the memoir "<a href="A%20Fish%20in%20the%20Water">A Fish in the Water</a>" ("El pez en el agua", 1993). Since his political defeat, he has focused mainly on his writing, with only occasional political involvement.

A month after losing the election, at the invitation of <a href="Octavio%20Paz">Octavio Paz</a>, Vargas Llosa attended a conference in Mexico entitled, "The 20th Century: The Experience of Freedom". Focused on the collapse of communist rule in central and eastern Europe, it was broadcast on Mexican television from 27 August to 2 September. Addressing the conference on 30 August 1990, Vargas Llosa embarrassed his hosts by condemning the Mexican system of power based on the rule of the <a href="Institutional%20Revolutionary%20Party">Institutional Revolutionary Party</a> (PRI), which had been in power for 61 years. Criticizing the PRI by name, he commented, "I don't believe that there has been in Latin America any case of a system of dictatorship which has so efficiently recruited the intellectual milieu, bribing it with great subtlety." He declared, "Mexico is the perfect dictatorship. The perfect dictatorship is not communism, not the USSR, not Fidel Castro; the perfect dictatorship is Mexico. Because it is a camouflaged dictatorship." The statement, "Mexico is the perfect dictatorship" became a cliché in Mexico and internationally, until the PRI fell from power in 2000.

Vargas Llosa has mainly lived in Madrid since the 1990s, but spends roughly three months of the year in Peru with his extended family. He also frequently visits London where he occasionally spends long periods. Vargas Llosa acquired Spanish citizenship in 1993, though he still holds <a href="Peruvian%20nationality%20law">Peruvian nationality</a>. The writer often reiterates his love for both countries. In his Nobel speech he observed: "I carry Peru deep inside me because that is where I was born, grew up, was formed, and lived those experiences of childhood and youth that shaped my personality and forged my calling". He then added: "I love Spain as much as Peru, and my debt to her is as great as my gratitude. If not for Spain, I never would have reached this podium or become a known writer".

Mario Vargas Llosa served as a visiting professor of Latin American studies at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> during the 1992-1993 academic year.—later on, Harvard recognized Vargas Llosa by conferring upon him an honorary <a href="Doctor%20of%20Letters">Doctor of Letters</a> degree in 1999. In 1994 he was elected a member of the "<a href="Real%20Academia%20Espa%C3%B1ola">Real Academia Española</a>" (Royal Spanish Academy), he took up seat L on 15 January 1996. He has been involved in the country's political arena. In February 2008 he stopped supporting the <a href="People%27s%20Party%20%28Spain%29">People's Party</a> in favor of the recently created <a href="Union%2C%20Progress%20and%20Democracy">Union, Progress and Democracy</a>, claiming that certain conservative views held by the former party are at odds with his classical liberal beliefs. His political ideologies appear in the book "<a href="Pol%C3%ADtica%20razonable">Política razonable</a>", written with <a href="Fernando%20Savater">Fernando Savater</a>, <a href="Rosa%20D%C3%ADez">Rosa Díez</a>, <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Pombo">Álvaro Pombo</a>, <a href="Albert%20Boadella">Albert Boadella</a> and <a href="Carlos%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20Gorriar%C3%A1n">Carlos Martínez Gorriarán</a>. He continues to write, both journalism and fiction, and to travel extensively. He has also taught as a visiting professor at a number of prominent universities.

On November 18, 2010, Vargas Llosa received the honorary degree Degree of Letters from the <a href="City%20College%20of%20New%20York">City College of New York</a> of the <a href="City%20University%20of%20New%20York">City University of New York</a>, where he also delivered the President's Lecture.

On 4 February 2011, Vargas Llosa was raised into the <a href="Spanish%20nobility">Spanish nobility</a> by <a href="Juan%20Carlos%20I%20of%20Spain">King Juan Carlos I</a> with the hereditary title of "<a href="Marquessate%20of%20Vargas%20Llosa">Marqués de Vargas Llosa</a>" ().

In April 2011, the writer took part in the <a href="Peruvian%20general%20election%2C%202011">Peruvian general election, 2011</a> by saying he was going to vote for <a href="Alejandro%20Toledo">Alejandro Toledo</a> (Peruvian former president 2001–2006). After casting his vote, he said his country should stay in the path of legality and freedom.

Vargas Llosa joined the <a href="Mont%20Pelerin%20Society">Mont Pelerin Society</a> in 2014. He is also a member of <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> based think tank, the <a href="Inter-American%20Dialogue">Inter-American Dialogue</a>.

As for hobbies, Vargas Llosa is fond of <a href="association%20football">association football</a> and is a supporter of <a href="Universitario%20de%20Deportes">Universitario de Deportes</a>. The writer himself has confessed in his book "<a href="A%20Fish%20in%20the%20Water">A Fish in the Water</a>" since childhood he has been a fan of the 'cream colored' team from <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, which was first seen in the field one day in 1946 when he was only 10 years old. In February 2011, Vargas Llosa was awarded with an honorary life membership of this football club, in a ceremony which took place in the <a href="Estadio%20Monumental%20%26quot%3BU%26quot%3B">Monumental Stadium</a> of <a href="Lima">Lima</a>.

He was named in the <a href="Panama%20Papers">Panama Papers</a> released by the <a href="International%20Consortium%20of%20Investigative%20Journalists">International Consortium of Investigative Journalists</a> on 10 May 2016.

Vargas Llosa is opposed to <a href="Catalan%20independence%20movement">Catalan independence</a> from Spain. Attending an anti-independence rally in October 2017, he said: "Spanish democracy is here to stay. No separatist conspiracy can destroy it."

Vargas Llosa's style encompasses historical material as well as his own personal experiences. For example, in his first novel, "The Time of the Hero", his own experiences at the Leoncio Prado military school informed his depiction of the corrupt social institution which mocked the moral standards it was supposed to uphold. Furthermore, the corruption of the book's school is a reflection of the corruption of Peruvian society at the time the novel was written. Vargas Llosa frequently uses his writing to challenge the inadequacies of society, such as demoralization and oppression by those in political power towards those who challenge this power. One of the main themes he has explored in his writing is the individual's struggle for freedom within an oppressive reality. For example, his two-volume novel "Conversation in the Cathedral" is based on the tyrannical dictatorship of Peruvian President <a href="Manuel%20A.%20Odr%C3%ADa">Manuel A. Odría</a>. The protagonist, Santiago, rebels against the suffocating dictatorship by participating in the subversive activities of leftist political groups. In addition to themes such as corruption and oppression, Vargas Llosa's second novel, "The Green House", explores "a denunciation of Peru's basic institutions", dealing with issues of abuse and exploitation of the workers in the brothel by corrupt military officers.

Many of Vargas Llosa's earlier novels were set in Peru, while in more recent work he has expanded to other regions of Latin America, such as Brazil and the Dominican Republic. His responsibilities as a writer and lecturer have allowed him to travel frequently and led to settings for his novels in regions outside of Peru. "The War of the End of the World" was his first major work set outside Peru. Though the plot deals with historical events of the <a href="Canudos">Canudos</a> revolt against the Brazilian government, the novel is not based directly on historical fact; rather, its main inspiration is the non-fiction account of those events published by Brazilian writer <a href="Euclides%20da%20Cunha">Euclides da Cunha</a> in 1902. "The Feast of the Goat", based on the dictatorship of <a href="Rafael%20Trujillo">Rafael Trujillo</a>, takes place in the <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a>; in preparation for this novel, Vargas Llosa undertook a comprehensive study of Dominican history. The novel was characteristically <a href="literary%20realism">realist</a>, and Vargas Llosa underscores that he "respected the basic facts, ... I have not exaggerated", but at the same time he points out "It's a novel, not a history book, so I took many, many liberties."

One of Vargas Llosa's more recent novels, "<a href="The%20Way%20to%20Paradise">The Way to Paradise</a>" ("El paraíso en la otra esquina"), is set largely in France and <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a>. Based on the biography of former social reformer <a href="Flora%20Tristan">Flora Tristan</a>, it demonstrates how Flora and <a href="Paul%20Gauguin">Paul Gauguin</a> were unable to find paradise, but were still able to inspire followers to keep working towards a socialist <a href="utopia">utopia</a>. Unfortunately, Vargas Llosa was not as successful in transforming these historical figures into fiction. Some critics, such as Barbara Mujica, argue that "The Way to Paradise" lacks the "audacity, energy, political vision, and narrative genius" that was present in his previous works.

The works of Mario Vargas Llosa are viewed as both <a href="modernist">modernist</a> and <a href="postmodernist">postmodernist</a> novels. Though there is still much debate over the differences between modernist and postmodernist literature, literary scholar M. Keith Booker claims that the difficulty and technical complexity of Vargas Llosa's early works, such as "The Green House" and "Conversation in the Cathedral", are clearly elements of the modern novel. Furthermore, these earlier novels all carry a certain seriousness of attitude—another important defining aspect of modernist art. By contrast, his later novels such as "Captain Pantoja and the Special Service", "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter", "The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta", and "<a href="The%20Storyteller%20%28Vargas%20Llosa%20novel%29">The Storyteller</a>" ("El hablador") appear to follow a postmodernist mode of writing. These novels have a much lighter, <a href="farce">farcical</a>, and comic tone, characteristics of postmodernism. Comparing two of Vargas Llosa's novels, "The Green House" and "Captain Pantoja and the Special Service", Booker discusses the contrast between modernism and postmodernism found in the writer's works: while both novels explore the theme of prostitution as well as the workings of the Peruvian military, Booker points out that the former is gravely serious whereas the latter is ridiculously comic.

Literary scholar M. Keith Booker argues that Vargas Llosa perfects the technique of interlacing dialogues in his novel "The Green House". By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates the illusion of a <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashback</a>. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places. This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using near the end of his first novel, "The Time of the Hero". However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in "The Green House" the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space. In contrast, "Captain Pantoja and the Special Service" employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts. This device is similar to both <a href="Virginia%20Woolf">Virginia Woolf</a>'s mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a> technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.

Vargas Llosa's first literary influences were relatively obscure Peruvian writers such as <a href="Mart%C3%ADn%20Ad%C3%A1n">Martín Adán</a>, <a href="Carlos%20Oquendo%20de%20Amat">Carlos Oquendo de Amat</a>, and <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Moro">César Moro</a>. As a young writer, he looked to these revolutionary novelists in search of new narrative structures and techniques in order to delineate a more contemporary, multifaceted experience of urban Peru. He was looking for a style different from the traditional descriptions of land and rural life made famous by Peru's foremost novelist at the time, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Arguedas">José María Arguedas</a>. Vargas Llosa wrote of Arguedas's work that it was "an example of old-fashioned regionalism that had already exhausted its imaginary possibilities". Although he did not share Arguedas's passion for indigenous reality, Vargas Llosa admired and respected the novelist for his contributions to Peruvian literature. Indeed, he has published a book-length study on his work, "La utopía arcaica" (1996).

Rather than restrict himself to Peruvian literature, Vargas Llosa also looked abroad for literary inspiration. Two French figures, <a href="existentialist">existentialist</a> <a href="Jean-Paul%20Sartre">Jean-Paul Sartre</a> and novelist <a href="Gustave%20Flaubert">Gustave Flaubert</a>, influenced both his technique and style. Sartre's influence is most prevalent in Vargas Llosa's extensive use of conversation. The epigraph of "The Time of the Hero", his first novel, is also taken directly from Sartre's work. Flaubert's artistic independence—his novels' disregard of reality and morals—has always been admired by Vargas Llosa, who wrote a book-length study of Flaubert's <a href="aesthetics">aesthetics</a>, "<a href="The%20Perpetual%20Orgy">The Perpetual Orgy</a>". In his analysis of Flaubert, Vargas Llosa questions the revolutionary power of literature in a political setting; this is in contrast to his earlier view that "literature is an act of rebellion", thus marking a transition in Vargas Llosa's aesthetic beliefs. Other critics such as Sabine Köllmann argue that his belief in the transforming power of literature is one of the great continuities that characterize his fictional and non-fictional work, and link his early statement that 'Literature is Fire' with his Nobel Prize Speech 'In Praise of Reading and Writing'.

One of Vargas Llosa's favourite novelists, and arguably the most influential on his writing career, is the American <a href="William%20Faulkner">William Faulkner</a>. Vargas Llosa considers Faulkner "the writer who perfected the methods of the modern novel". Both writers' styles include intricate changes in time and narration. In "The Time of the Hero", for example, aspects of Vargas Llosa's plot, his main character's development and his use of narrative time are influenced by his favourite Faulkner novel, "<a href="Light%20in%20August">Light in August</a>".

In addition to the studies of Arguedas and Flaubert, Vargas Llosa has written literary criticisms of other authors that he has admired, such as Gabriel García Márquez, <a href="Albert%20Camus">Albert Camus</a>, <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>, and <a href="Jean-Paul%20Sartre">Jean-Paul Sartre</a>. The main goals of his non-fiction works are to acknowledge the influence of these authors on his writing, and to recognize a connection between himself and the other writers; critic Sara Castro-Klarén argues that he offers little systematic analysis of these authors' literary techniques. In "The Perpetual Orgy", for example, he discusses the relationship between his own aesthetics and Flaubert's, rather than focusing on Flaubert's alone.

Mario Vargas Llosa is considered a major Latin American writer, alongside other authors such as <a href="Octavio%20Paz">Octavio Paz</a>, <a href="Julio%20Cort%C3%A1zar">Julio Cortázar</a>, <a href="Jorge%20Luis%20Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a>, <a href="Gabriel%20Garc%C3%ADa%20M%C3%A1rquez">Gabriel García Márquez</a> and <a href="Carlos%20Fuentes">Carlos Fuentes</a>. In his book "The New Novel in Latin America" ("La Nueva Novela"), Fuentes offers an in-depth literary criticism of the positive influence Vargas Llosa's work has had on Latin American literature. Indeed, for the literary critic <a href="Gerald%20Martin">Gerald Martin</a>, writing in 1987, Vargas Llosa was "perhaps the most successful ... certainly the most controversial Latin American novelist of the past twenty-five years".

Most of Vargas Llosa's narratives have been translated into multiple languages, marking his international critical success. Vargas Llosa is also noted for his substantial contribution to journalism, an accomplishment characteristic of few other Latin American writers. He is recognized among those who have most consciously promoted literature in general, and more specifically the novel itself, as avenues for meaningful commentary about life. During his career, he has written more than a dozen novels and many other books and stories, and, for decades, he has been a voice for Latin American literature. He has won numerous awards for his writing, from the 1959 "<a href="Premio%20Leopoldo%20Alas">Premio Leopoldo Alas</a>" and the 1962 "<a href="Premio%20Biblioteca%20Breve">Premio Biblioteca Breve</a>" to the 1993 "<a href="Premio%20Planeta">Premio Planeta</a>" (for "Death in the Andes") and the <a href="Jerusalem%20Prize">Jerusalem Prize</a> in 1995. The literary critic <a href="Harold%20Bloom">Harold Bloom</a> has included his novel "<a href="The%20War%20of%20the%20End%20of%20the%20World">The War of the End of the World</a>" in his list of essential literary works in the <a href="Western%20Canon">Western Canon</a>. An important distinction he has received is the 1994 <a href="Miguel%20de%20Cervantes%20Prize">Miguel de Cervantes Prize</a>, considered the most important accolade in Spanish-language literature and awarded to authors whose "work has contributed to enrich, in a notable way, the literary patrimony of the Spanish language". In 2002, Vargas was the recipient of the <a href="PEN/Nabokov%20Award">PEN/Nabokov Award</a>. Vargas Llosa also received the 2005 <a href="Irving%20Kristol%20Award">Irving Kristol Award</a> from the <a href="American%20Enterprise%20Institute">American Enterprise Institute</a> and was the 2008 recipient of the Harold and Ethel L. Stellfox Visiting Scholar and Writers Award at <a href="Dickinson%20College">Dickinson College</a>.

A number of Vargas Llosa's works have been adapted for the screen, including "The Time of the Hero" and "Captain Pantoja and the Special Service" (both by the Peruvian director <a href="Francisco%20Lombardi">Francisco Lombardi</a>) and "The Feast of the Goat" (by Vargas Llosa's cousin, <a href="Luis%20Llosa">Luis Llosa</a>). "<a href="Aunt%20Julia%20and%20the%20Scriptwriter">Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter</a>" was turned into the English-language film, "<a href="Tune%20in%20Tomorrow">Tune in Tomorrow</a>". "The Feast of the Goat" has also been adapted as a theatrical play by <a href="Jorge%20Al%C3%AD%20Triana">Jorge Alí Triana</a>, a Colombian playwright and director.








Vargas Llosa's essays and journalism have been collected as "Contra viento y marea", issued in three volumes (1983, 1986, and 1990). A selection has been edited by John King and translated and published as "Making Waves".

John Le Mesurier

John Le Mesurier (, born John Elton Le Mesurier Halliley; 5 April 191215 November 1983) was an English actor. He is perhaps best remembered for his comedic role as <a href="Sergeant%20Arthur%20Wilson">Sergeant Arthur Wilson</a> in the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> television <a href="situation%20comedy">situation comedy</a> "<a href="Dad%27s%20Army">Dad's Army</a>" (1968–77). A self-confessed "jobbing actor", Le Mesurier appeared in more than 120 films across a range of genres, normally in smaller supporting parts.

Le Mesurier became interested in the stage as a young adult and enrolled at the <a href="Fay%20Compton">Fay Compton Studio of Dramatic Art</a> in 1933. From there he took a position in <a href="repertory%20theatre">repertory theatre</a> and made his stage debut in September 1934 at the Palladium Theatre in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> in the <a href="J.%20B.%20Priestley">J. B. Priestley</a> play "<a href="Dangerous%20Corner">Dangerous Corner</a>". He later accepted an offer to work with <a href="Alec%20Guinness">Alec Guinness</a> in a <a href="John%20Gielgud">John Gielgud</a> production of "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>". He first appeared on television in 1938 as Seigneur de Miolans in the BBC broadcast of "The Marvellous History of St Bernard". During the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> Le Mesurier was posted to <a href="British%20Raj">British India</a>, as a <a href="Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">captain</a> with the <a href="Royal%20Tank%20Regiment">Royal Tank Regiment</a>. He returned to acting and made his film debut in 1948, starring in the <a href="B%20movie">second feature</a> comedy short "<a href="Death%20in%20the%20Hand">Death in the Hand</a>", opposite <a href="Esme%20Percy">Esme Percy</a> and <a href="Ernest%20Jay">Ernest Jay</a>.

Le Mesurier had a prolific film career, appearing mostly in comedies, usually in roles portraying figures of authority such as army officers, policemen and judges. As well as "<a href="Hancock%27s%20Half%20Hour">Hancock's Half Hour</a>", Le Mesurier appeared in Hancock's two principal films, "<a href="The%20Rebel%20%281961%20film%29">The Rebel</a>" and "<a href="The%20Punch%20and%20Judy%20Man">The Punch and Judy Man</a>". In 1971 Le Mesurier received his only award: a <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a> "Best Television Actor" award for his lead performance in <a href="Dennis%20Potter">Dennis Potter</a>'s television play "<a href="Traitor%20%28TV%20drama%29">Traitor</a>"; it was one of the few lead roles he played during the course of his career.

He took a relaxed approach to acting and felt that his parts were those of "a decent chap all at sea in a chaotic world not of his own making". Le Mesurier was married three times, most notably to the actress <a href="Hattie%20Jacques">Hattie Jacques</a>. A heavy drinker of alcohol for most of his life, Le Mesurier died in 1983, aged 71, from a stomach haemorrhage, brought about as a complication of <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a> of the liver. After his death, critics reflected that, for an actor who normally took minor roles, the viewing public were "enormously fond of him".

Le Mesurier was born John Elton Le Mesurier Halliley, in <a href="Bedford">Bedford</a> on 5 April 1912. His parents were Charles Elton Halliley, a <a href="solicitor">solicitor</a>, and Amy Michelle ( Le Mesurier), whose family were from <a href="Alderney">Alderney</a> in the <a href="Channel%20Islands">Channel Islands</a>; both families were affluent, with histories of government service or work in the legal profession. While John was an infant the family settled in <a href="Bury%20St%20Edmunds">Bury St Edmunds</a>, in <a href="West%20Suffolk%20%28county%29">West Suffolk</a>. He was sent to school, first to Grenham House in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, and later to <a href="Sherborne%20School">Sherborne School</a> in Dorset where one of his fellow-pupils was <a href="Alan%20Turing">Alan Turing</a>. Le Mesurier disliked both schools intensely, citing insensitive teaching methods and an inability to accept individualism. He later wrote: "I resented Sherborne for its closed mind, its collective capacity for rejecting anything that did not conform to the image of manhood as portrayed in the ripping yarns of a scouting manual".

From an early age Le Mesurier had been interested in acting and performing; as a child he had frequently been taken to the <a href="West%20End%20of%20London">West End of London</a> to watch <a href="Ralph%20Lynn">Ralph Lynn</a> and <a href="Tom%20Walls">Tom Walls</a> perform in the popular series of <a href="Aldwych%20farce">farces</a> at the <a href="Aldwych%20Theatre">Aldwych Theatre</a>. These experiences fuelled an early desire to make a career on the stage. After leaving school he was initially persuaded to follow his father's line of work, as an <a href="articled%20clerk">articled clerk</a> at Greene & Greene, a firm of solicitors in Bury St Edmunds; in his spare time he took part in local amateur dramatics. In 1933 he decided to leave the legal profession, and in September he enrolled at the <a href="Fay%20Compton">Fay Compton Studio of Dramatic Art</a>; a fellow-student was <a href="Alec%20Guinness">Alec Guinness</a>, with whom he became close friends. In July 1934, the studio staged their annual public revue in which both Le Mesurier and Guinness took part; among the judges for the event were <a href="John%20Gielgud">John Gielgud</a>, <a href="Leslie%20Henson">Leslie Henson</a>, <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> and <a href="Ivor%20Novello">Ivor Novello</a>. Le Mesurier received a Certificate of Fellowship, while Guinness won the Fay Compton prize. After the revue, rather than remain at the studio for further tuition Le Mesurier took an opportunity to join the Edinburgh-based <a href="Millicent%20Ward%27s%20Studio%20Theatre">Millicent Ward Repertory Players</a> at a salary of £3.10s (£3.50) a week.

The Millicent Ward repertory company typically staged evening performances of three-act plays; the works changed each week, and rehearsals were held during the daytime for the following week's production. Under his birth name John Halliley, Le Mesurier made his stage debut in September 1934 at the <a href="Palladium%20Theatre%2C%20Edinburgh">Palladium Theatre, Edinburgh</a> in the <a href="J.%20B.%20Priestley">J. B. Priestley</a> play "<a href="Dangerous%20Corner">Dangerous Corner</a>", along with three other newcomers to the company. The reviewer for "<a href="The%20Scotsman">The Scotsman</a>" thought that Le Mesurier was well cast in the role. Appearances in "While Parents Sleep" and <a href="Cavalcade%20%28play%29">"Cavalcade"</a> were followed by a break, as problems arose with the lease of the theatre. Le Mesurier then accepted an offer to appear with Alec Guinness in a John Gielgud production of "Hamlet", which began in Streatham in the spring of 1935 and later toured the English provinces. Le Mesurier <a href="understudy">understudied</a> <a href="Anthony%20Quayle">Anthony Quayle</a>'s role of <a href="Rosencrantz%20and%20Guildenstern">Guildenstern</a>, and otherwise appeared in the play as an <a href="Extra%20%28actor%29">extra</a>.

In July 1935, Le Mesurier was hired by the <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a> repertory company, based at the <a href="Oldham%20Coliseum%20Theatre">Coliseum Theatre</a>; his first appearance with them was in a version of the <a href="Wilson%20Collison">Wilson Collison</a> play, "Up in Mabel's Room"; he was sacked after one week for missing a performance after oversleeping. In September 1935, he moved to the <a href="Sheffield%20Repertory%20Theatre">Sheffield Repertory Theatre</a> to appear in "Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary", and also played <a href="Malvolio">Malvolio</a> in Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night". Le Mesurier later commented on the slow progress of his career: "had I known it was going to take so long, I might well have given the whole thing up". In 1937 he joined the <a href="Croydon">Croydon</a> Repertory Theatre, where he appeared in nine productions in 1936 and 1937. During this period Le Mesurier changed his professional name from John Halliley to John Le Mesurier; his biographer Graham McCann observes that "he never bothered, at least in public, to explain the reason for his decision". Le Mesurier used his new name for the first time in the September 1937 production of "<a href="Love%20on%20the%20Dole%23The%20play">Love on the Dole</a>".

Le Mesurier first appeared on television in 1938, thus becoming one of the medium's pioneering actors. His initial appearance was in a production of "The Marvellous History of St Bernard" in which he appeared as Seigneur de Miolans in a play adapted from a 15th-century manuscript by <a href="Henri%20Gh%C3%A9on">Henri Ghéon</a>. Alongside the television appearance, he continued to appear on stage in Edinburgh and Glasgow with the Howard and Wyndham Players, at least until late 1938 when he returned to London and re-joined Croydon Repertory Theatre. His second spell with the troupe ended a few months later when, from May to October 1939 he appeared in "<a href="Gaslight%20%28play%29">Gaslight</a>", first in London and subsequently on tour. The reviewer in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" considered that Le Mesurier gave "a faultless performance", and that "the character is not overemphasised. One may praise it best by saying that Mr. Le Mesurier gives one a really uncomfortable feeling in the stomach".

From November to December 1939, Le Mesurier toured Britain in a production of "<a href="Goodness%2C%20How%20Sad">Goodness, How Sad</a>", during which time he met the director's daughter, June Melville, whom he married in April 1940. After spending January and February 1940 in "<a href="French%20Without%20Tears">French Without Tears</a>" at the Grand Theatre in Blackpool, he returned to London where he was employed by the <a href="Brixton">Brixton</a> Theatre, appearing in a series of productions. In his time in repertory, Le Mesurier took on a variety of roles across a number of genres; his biographer Graham McCann observed that his range included "comedies and tragedies, thrillers and fantasies, tense courtroom dramas and frenzied farces, Shakespeare and <a href="Henrik%20Ibsen">Ibsen</a>, <a href="Richard%20Brinsley%20Sheridan">Sheridan</a> and <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Wilde</a>, <a href="Moli%C3%A8re">Molière</a> and <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">Shaw</a>, <a href="William%20Congreve">Congreve</a> and <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Coward</a>. The range was remarkable".

In September 1940 Le Mesurier's rented home was hit by a German bomb, destroying all his possessions, including his call-up papers. In the same bombing raid, the theatre in Brixton in which he was working was also hit. A few days later he reported for basic training with the <a href="Royal%20Armoured%20Corps">Royal Armoured Corps</a>; in June 1941 he was commissioned into the <a href="Royal%20Tank%20Regiment">Royal Tank Regiment</a>. He served in Britain until 1943 when he was posted to <a href="British%20Raj">British India</a> where he spent the rest of the war. Le Mesurier later claimed that he had had "a comfortable war, with <a href="Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">captaincy</a> thrust upon me, before I was <a href="Demobilisation%20of%20the%20British%20Armed%20Forces%20after%20the%20Second%20World%20War">demobbed</a> in 1946".

On his return to Britain, Le Mesurier returned to acting; he initially struggled for work, finding only a few minor roles. In February 1948 he made his film debut in the <a href="B%20movie">second feature</a> comedy short "<a href="Death%20in%20the%20Hand">Death in the Hand</a>", which starred <a href="Esme%20Percy">Esme Percy</a> and <a href="Ernest%20Jay">Ernest Jay</a>. He followed this with equally small roles in the 1949 film "<a href="Old%20Mother%20Riley%27s%20New%20Venture">Old Mother Riley's New Venture</a>"—where his name was misspelt on the credits as "Le Meseurier"—and the 1950 crime film "<a href="Dark%20Interval">Dark Interval</a>". During the same period he also frequently appeared on stage in Birmingham.

Le Mesurier undertook several roles on television in 1951, including that of Doctor Forrest in "The Railway Children", the blackmailer Eduardo Lucas in "Sherlock Holmes: The Second Stain", and <a href="Saint%20Joseph">Joseph</a> in the nativity play "A Time to be Born". In the same year <a href="Tony%20Hancock">Tony Hancock</a> joined Le Mesurier's second wife, <a href="Hattie%20Jacques">Hattie Jacques</a> (the couple had married in 1949 following his divorce from June Melville earlier that year) in the radio series "<a href="Educating%20Archie">Educating Archie</a>". Le Mesurier and Hancock became friends; they would often go for drinking sessions around <a href="Soho">Soho</a>, where they ended up in jazz clubs. After Hancock left "Educating Archie" in 1952 after one season, the friendship continued, and Jacques joined the cast of "<a href="Hancock%27s%20Half%20Hour">Hancock's Half Hour</a>" during the fourth radio series in 1956.

In 1952, as well as appearing in the films "<a href="Blind%20Man%27s%20Bluff%20%281952%20film%29">Blind Man's Bluff</a>" and "<a href="Mother%20Riley%20Meets%20the%20Vampire">Mother Riley Meets the Vampire</a>", Le Mesurier also appeared as the doctor in "Angry Dust" at the New Torch Theatre, London. <a href="Parnell%20Bradbury">Parnell Bradbury</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", thought Le Mesurier had played the role extraordinarily well; <a href="Harold%20Hobson">Harold Hobson</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>", thought that "the trouble with Mr. John Le Mesurier's Dr. Weston is that he approaches the man too snarlingly ... [it is] a notion of genius that would be unacceptable anywhere outside Victorian melodrama". In 1953, he had a role as a bureaucrat in the short film "<a href="The%20Pleasure%20Garden%20%281953%20film%29">The Pleasure Garden</a>", which won the "Prix de Fantasie Poetique" at the <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a> in 1954. After a long run of small roles in second features, his 1955 portrayal of the registrar in <a href="Boulting%20brothers">Roy Boulting's</a> comedy "<a href="Josephine%20and%20Men">Josephine and Men</a>", "jerked him out of the rut", according to <a href="Philip%20Oakes">Philip Oakes</a>.

Following his appearance in "Josephine and Men", John and Roy Boulting cast Le Mesurier as a <a href="psychiatrist">psychiatrist</a> in their 1956 Second World War film, "<a href="Private%27s%20Progress">Private's Progress</a>". The cast featured many leading British actors of the time, including <a href="Ian%20Carmichael">Ian Carmichael</a> and <a href="Richard%20Attenborough">Richard Attenborough</a>. <a href="Dilys%20Powell">Dilys Powell</a>, reviewing for "The Sunday Times", thought that the cast was "embellished" by Le Mesurier's presence, among others. Later in 1956 Le Mesurier again appeared alongside Attenborough, with small roles in <a href="Jay%20Lewis">Jay Lewis</a>'s "<a href="The%20Baby%20and%20the%20Battleship">The Baby and the Battleship</a>" and Roy Boulting's "<a href="Brothers%20in%20Law%20%28film%29">Brothers in Law</a>", the latter which also featured Carmichael and <a href="Terry-Thomas">Terry-Thomas</a>. He was also active in television, in a variety of roles in episodes of "<a href="Douglas%20Fairbanks%20Presents">Douglas Fairbanks Presents</a>", a series of short dramas.

Le Mesurier's friendship with Tony Hancock provided a further source of work when Hancock asked him to be one of the regular supporting actors in "Hancock's Half Hour", when it moved from radio to television. Le Mesurier subsequently appeared in seven episodes of the show between 1957 and 1960, and then in an episode of a follow-up series entitled "Hancock". In 1958 he appeared in ten films, among them Roy Boulting's comedy "<a href="Happy%20Is%20the%20Bride">Happy Is the Bride</a>", about which Dilys Powell wrote in "The Sunday Times": "[M]y vote for the most entertaining contributions ... goes to the two fathers, John Le Mesurier and <a href="Cecil%20Parker">Cecil Parker</a>". In 1959, the busiest year of his career, Le Mesurier took part in 13 films, including "<a href="I%27m%20All%20Right%20Jack">I'm All Right Jack</a>", which was the most successful of Le Mesurier's credited films that year; he also had an uncredited role as a doctor in "<a href="Ben-Hur%20%281959%20film%29">Ben-Hur</a>".

Le Mesurier appeared in nine films in 1960, as well as nine television programmes, including episodes of "<a href="Hancock%27s%20Half%20Hour">Hancock's Half Hour</a>", "<a href="Saber%20of%20London">Saber of London</a>" and "<a href="Danger%20Man">Danger Man</a>". His work the following year included a part in Peter Sellers's directorial debut "<a href="Mr.%20Topaze">Mr. Topaze</a>", a film which failed both critically and commercially. He provided the voice of Mr. Justice Byrne in a recording of excerpts from the transcript of "<a href="R%20v%20Penguin%20Books%20Ltd.">R v Penguin Books Ltd.</a>"—the court case concerning the publication of <a href="D.%20H.%20Lawrence">D. H. Lawrence</a>'s "<a href="Lady%20Chatterley%27s%20Lover">Lady Chatterley's Lover</a>"—which also featured <a href="Michael%20Hordern">Michael Hordern</a> and <a href="Maurice%20Denham">Maurice Denham</a>. J.W. Lambert, reviewing for "The Sunday Times", wrote that Le Mesurier gave "precisely the air of confident incredulity which the learned gentleman exhibited in court". Later that year he played Hancock's office manager in the first of Tony Hancock's two principal film vehicles, "<a href="The%20Rebel%20%281961%20film%29">The Rebel</a>".

In 1962 he appeared in <a href="Wendy%20Toye">Wendy Toye</a>'s comedy film "<a href="We%20Joined%20the%20Navy">We Joined the Navy</a>" before reuniting with Peter Sellers in "<a href="Only%20Two%20Can%20Play">Only Two Can Play</a>", Sidney Gilliat's film of the novel "<a href="That%20Uncertain%20Feeling%20%28novel%29">That Uncertain Feeling</a>" by <a href="Kingsley%20Amis">Kingsley Amis</a>; Powell noted with pleasure "the armour of his gravity pierced by polite bewilderment". She compared Le Mesurier with the well-known American straight-face comedian, <a href="John%20McGiver">John McGiver</a>. After appearing in another Sellers film in 1962—"<a href="Waltz%20of%20the%20Toreadors%20%28film%29">Waltz of the Toreadors</a>"—Le Mesurier joined him in the 1963 comedy "<a href="The%20Wrong%20Arm%20of%20the%20Law">The Wrong Arm of the Law</a>". Powell again reviewed the pair's film, commenting that "I thought I knew by now every shade in the acting of John Le Mesurier (not that I could ever get tired of any of them); but there seems a new shade here". In the same year he appeared in a third Sellers film, "<a href="The%20Pink%20Panther%20%281963%20film%29">The Pink Panther</a>", as a defence lawyer, and in the second and last of Tony Hancock's starring vehicles, "<a href="The%20Punch%20and%20Judy%20Man">The Punch and Judy Man</a>". Le Mesurier played Sandman in the latter film; Powell wrote that the role "allowed a gentler and subtler character than usual". He also appeared in a series of advertisements for <a href="Homepride">Homepride</a> flour in 1964, providing the <a href="voice-over">voice-over</a> for the animated character Fred the Flourgrader; he continued as the voice until 1983.

In a change from his usual comedic roles, Le Mesurier portrayed the Reverend Jonathan Ives in <a href="Jacques%20Tourneur">Jacques Tourneur</a>'s 1965 science fiction film, "<a href="City%20Under%20the%20Sea">City Under the Sea</a>", before returning to comedy in "<a href="Where%20the%20Spies%20Are">Where the Spies Are</a>", a comedy-adventure film directed by <a href="Val%20Guest">Val Guest</a>, which starred <a href="David%20Niven">David Niven</a>. In 1966 Le Mesurier also played the role of Colonel Maynard in the <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> sitcom "<a href="George%20and%20the%20Dragon%20%28TV%20series%29">George and the Dragon</a>", with <a href="Sid%20James">Sid James</a> and <a href="Peggy%20Mount">Peggy Mount</a>. The programme ran to four series between 1966 and 1968, totalling 26 episodes. He also took a role in four episodes of a "<a href="Coronation%20Street">Coronation Street</a>" spin-off series, "<a href="Pardon%20the%20Expression">Pardon the Expression</a>", in which he starred opposite <a href="Arthur%20Lowe">Arthur Lowe</a>.

In 1968 Le Mesurier was offered a role in a new BBC <a href="sitcom">situation comedy</a> playing an upper-middle-class <a href="Sergeant%20Arthur%20Wilson">Sergeant Arthur Wilson</a> in "<a href="Dad%27s%20Army">Dad's Army</a>"; he was the second choice after <a href="Robert%20Dorning">Robert Dorning</a>. Le Mesurier was unsure about taking the part as he was finishing the final series of "George and the Dragon" and did not want another long-term television role. He was persuaded both by an increase in his fee—to £262 10s (£262.50) per episode—and by the casting of his old friend <a href="Clive%20Dunn">Clive Dunn</a> as <a href="Lance-Corporal%20Jack%20Jones">Corporal Jones</a>. Le Mesurier was initially unsure of how to portray his character, and was advised by series writer <a href="Jimmy%20Perry">Jimmy Perry</a> to make the part his own. Le Mesurier decided to base the character on himself, later writing that "I thought, why not just be myself, use an extension of my own personality and behave rather as I had done in the army? So I always left a button or two undone, and had the sleeve of my battle dress slightly turned up. I spoke softly, issued commands as if they were invitations (the sort not likely to be accepted) and generally assumed a benign air of helplessness". Perry later observed that "we wanted Wilson to be the voice of sanity; he has become John".

<a href="Nicholas%20de%20Jongh">Nicholas de Jongh</a>, in a tribute written after Le Mesurier's death, suggested that it was in the role of Wilson that Le Mesurier became a star. His interaction with Arthur Lowe's character <a href="Captain%20George%20Mainwaring">Captain George Mainwaring</a> was described by "The Times" as "a memorable part of one of television's most popular shows". Tise Vahimagi, writing for the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>'s <a href="Screenonline">Screenonline</a>, agreed, and commented that "it was the hesitant exchanges of one-upmanship between Le Mesurier's Wilson, a figure of delicate gentility, and Arthur Lowe's pompous, middle class platoon leader Captain Mainwaring, that added to its finest moments". Le Mesurier enjoyed making the series, particularly the fortnight the cast would spend in <a href="Thetford">Thetford</a> each year filming the outside scenes. The programme lasted for nine series over nine years, and covered eighty episodes, ending in 1977.

During the filming of the series in 1969, Le Mesurier was flown to Venice over a series of weekends to appear in the film "<a href="Midas%20Run">Midas Run</a>", an <a href="Alf%20Kjellin">Alf Kjellin</a>-directed crime film that also starred <a href="Richard%20Crenna">Richard Crenna</a>, <a href="Anne%20Heywood">Anne Heywood</a> and <a href="Fred%20Astaire">Fred Astaire</a>. Le Mesurier became friends with Astaire during the filming and they often dined together in a local cafe while watching horse-racing on television. In 1971 <a href="Norman%20Cohen">Norman Cohen</a> directed a <a href="Dad%27s%20Army%20%281971%20film%29">feature film of "Dad's Army"</a>; Le Mesurier also appeared as Wilson in a stage adaptation, which toured the UK in 1975–76. Following the success of "Dad's Army", Le Mesurier recorded the single "<a href="A%20Nightingale%20Sang%20in%20Berkeley%20Square%20%28song%29">A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square</a>" with "Hometown" on the reverse side (the latter with Arthur Lowe). This, and an album, "Dad's Army", featuring the whole cast, was released on the Warner label in 1975.

In between his performances in "Dad's Army", Le Mesurier acted in films, including the role of the prison governor opposite <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a> in the 1969 <a href="Peter%20Collinson%20%28film%20director%29">Peter Collinson</a>-directed "<a href="The%20Italian%20Job">The Italian Job</a>". The cinema historian Amy Sargeant likened Le Mesurier's role to the "mild demeanour" of his Sergeant Wilson character. In 1970, Le Mesurier appeared in Ralph Thomas's "<a href="Doctor%20in%20Trouble">Doctor in Trouble</a>" as the purser; he also made an appearance in <a href="Vincente%20Minnelli">Vincente Minnelli</a>'s "<a href="On%20a%20Clear%20Day%20You%20Can%20See%20Forever%20%28film%29">On a Clear Day You Can See Forever</a>", a <a href="romantic%20fantasy">romantic fantasy</a> <a href="Musical%20film">musical</a>.

In 1971 Le Mesurier played the lead role in <a href="Dennis%20Potter">Dennis Potter</a>'s television play "<a href="Traitor%20%28TV%20drama%29">Traitor</a>", in which he portrayed a "boozy British aristocrat who became a spy for the Soviets"; his performance won him a <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a> "Best Television Actor" award. Writing for the British Film Institute, Sergio Angelini considered "Le Mesurier is utterly compelling throughout in an atypical role". Chris Dunkley, writing in "The Times", described the performance as "a superbly persuasive portrait, made vividly real by one of the best performances Mr Mesurier has ever given". The reviewer for "The Sunday Times" agreed, saying that Le Mesurier, "after a lifetime supporting other actors with the strength of a pit-prop, gets the main part; he looks, sounds and feels exactly right". Reviewing for "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", <a href="Nancy%20Banks-Smith">Nancy Banks-Smith</a> called the role "his <a href="Prince%20Hamlet">Hamlet</a>", and said that it was worth waiting for. Although delighted to have won the award, Le Mesurier commented that the aftermath proved "something of an anticlimax. No exciting offers of work came in".

Le Mesurier made a cameo appearance in Val Guest's 1972 sex comedy "<a href="Au%20Pair%20Girls">Au Pair Girls</a>", and starred alongside <a href="Warren%20Mitchell">Warren Mitchell</a> and <a href="Dandy%20Nichols">Dandy Nichols</a> in <a href="Bob%20Kellett">Bob Kellett</a>'s "<a href="The%20Alf%20Garnett%20Saga">The Alf Garnett Saga</a>". In 1974 he played a police inspector in a similar Val Guest comedy, "<a href="Confessions%20of%20a%20Window%20Cleaner">Confessions of a Window Cleaner</a>", alongside <a href="Robin%20Askwith">Robin Askwith</a> and <a href="Antony%20Booth">Antony Booth</a>. The following year he also narrated "<a href="Bod%20%28series%29">Bod</a>", an animated children's programme from the BBC; there were thirteen episodes in total.

In 1977 Le Mesurier portrayed <a href="Jacob%20Marley">Jacob Marley</a> in a BBC television adaptation of "<a href="A%20Christmas%20Carol">A Christmas Carol</a>", which starred <a href="Michael%20Hordern">Michael Hordern</a> as <a href="Ebenezer%20Scrooge">Ebenezer Scrooge</a>; Sergio Angelini, writing for the British Film Institute about Le Mesurier's portrayal, considered that "although never frightening, he does exert a strong sense of melancholy, his every move and inflection seemingly tinged with regret and remorse". In 1979 he portrayed Sir Gawain in <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a>'s "<a href="Unidentified%20Flying%20Oddball">Unidentified Flying Oddball</a>", directed by <a href="Russ%20Mayberry">Russ Mayberry</a>, and co-starring <a href="Dennis%20Dugan">Dennis Dugan</a>, <a href="Jim%20Dale">Jim Dale</a> and <a href="Kenneth%20More">Kenneth More</a>. The film, an adaptation of <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a>'s novel "<a href="A%20Connecticut%20Yankee%20in%20King%20Arthur%27s%20Court">A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</a>", was hailed by "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28company%29">Time Out</a>" as "an intelligent film with a cohesive plot and an amusing script" and cited it as "one of the better Disney attempts to hop on the sci-fi bandwagon". The reviewers praised the cast, particularly Kenneth More's Arthur and Le Mesurier's Gawain, which they said were "rather touchingly portrayed as friends who have grown old together".

Le Mesurier played <a href="List%20of%20minor%20The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%20characters%23The%20Wise%20Old%20Bird">The Wise Old Bird</a> in the 1980 <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> series "<a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%20%28radio%20series%29">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>" and appeared on the same station as <a href="Bilbo%20Baggins">Bilbo Baggins</a> in the <a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%20%281981%20radio%20series%29">1981 radio version</a> of "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>". In the spring of 1980 he took the role of David Bliss alongside <a href="Constance%20Cummings">Constance Cummings</a>—as Judith Bliss—in a production of <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a>'s 1920s play "<a href="Hay%20Fever%20%28play%29">Hay Fever</a>". Writing for "The Observer", Robert Cushman thought that Le Mesurier played the role with "deeply grizzled torpor", while <a href="Michael%20Billington%20%28critic%29">Michael Billington</a>, reviewing for "The Guardian", saw him as a "grey, gentle wisp of a man, full of half-completed gestures and seraphic smiles".

He took on the role of Father Mowbray in <a href="ITV%20Granada">Granada Television's</a> 1981 adaptation of "<a href="Brideshead%20Revisited%20%28TV%20serial%29">Brideshead Revisited</a>". He guest-starred in episodes of the British comedy television series "<a href="The%20Goodies%20%28TV%20series%29">The Goodies</a>", and in an early episode of "<a href="Hi-de-Hi%21">Hi-de-Hi!</a>". His final film appearance was also Peter Sellers's final cinema role, "<a href="The%20Fiendish%20Plot%20of%20Dr.%20Fu%20Manchu">The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu</a>", which was completed just months before Sellers's death in July 1980.

In 1982 Le Mesurier reprised the role of Arthur Wilson for "<a href="It%20Sticks%20Out%20Half%20a%20Mile">It Sticks Out Half a Mile</a>", a radio sequel to "Dad's Army", in which Wilson had become the bank manager of the Frambourne-on-Sea branch, while Arthur Lowe's character, Captain George Mainwaring, was trying to apply for a loan to renovate the local pier. The death of Lowe in April 1982 meant that only a pilot episode was recorded, and the project was suspended. It was revived in 1982 with Lowe's role replaced by two other "Dad's Army" cast members: <a href="Private%20Frank%20Pike">Pike</a>, played by <a href="Ian%20Lavender">Ian Lavender</a>, and <a href="List%20of%20Dad%27s%20Army%20characters%23ARP%20Warden%20William%20Hodges">Hodges</a>, played by <a href="Bill%20Pertwee">Bill Pertwee</a>. A pilot and twelve episodes were subsequently recorded, and broadcast in 1984. Le Mesurier also teamed up with another ex-"Dad's Army" colleague, Clive Dunn, to record a novelty single, "There Ain't Much Change from a Pound These Days"/"After All These Years", which had been written by Le Mesurier's stepson, David Malin. The single was released on KA Records in 1982.

He appeared opposite <a href="Anthony%20Hopkins">Anthony Hopkins</a> in a four-part television series, "A Married Man", in March 1983, before undertaking the narration on the short film "<a href="The%20Passionate%20Pilgrim%20%28film%29">The Passionate Pilgrim</a>", an <a href="Eric%20Morecambe">Eric Morecambe</a> vehicle, which was Morecambe's last film before his death.

In 1939, Le Mesurier accepted a role in the <a href="Robert%20Morley">Robert Morley</a> play "Goodness, How Sad!", directed by June Melville—whose father Frederick owned a number of theatres, including the <a href="Lyceum%20Theatre%2C%20London">Lyceum</a>, <a href="Shaftesbury%20Theatre">Prince's</a> and Brixton. Melville and Le Mesurier soon began a romance, and were married in April 1940. Le Mesurier was <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">conscripted</a> into the army in September 1940; after his demobilisation in 1946, he discovered that his wife had become an alcoholic: "She became careless about appointments and haphazard professionally". As a result, the couple separated and were divorced in 1949.

In June 1947, Le Mesurier went with fellow actor <a href="Geoffrey%20Hibbert">Geoffrey Hibbert</a> to the <a href="Players%27%20Theatre">Players' Theatre</a> in London, where among the performers was Hattie Jacques. Le Mesurier and Jacques began to see each other regularly; Le Mesurier was still married, albeit estranged from his wife. In 1949, when his divorce came through, Jacques proposed to Le Mesurier, asking him, "Don't you think it's about time we got married?". The couple married in November 1949 and had two sons, Robin and Kim.

Jacques began an affair in 1962 with her driver, John Schofield, who gave her the attention and support that Le Mesurier did not. When Jacques decided to move Schofield into the family home, Le Mesurier moved into a separate room and tried to repair the marriage. He later commented about this period: "I could have walked out, but, whatever my feelings, I loved Hattie and the children and I was certain—I had to be certain—that we could repair the damage". The affair caused a downturn in his health; he collapsed on holiday in <a href="Tangier">Tangier</a> in 1963 and was hospitalised in Gibraltar. He returned to London to find the situation between his wife and her lover was unchanged, which caused a relapse.

During the final stages of the breakdown of his marriage, Le Mesurier met <a href="Joan%20Le%20Mesurier">Joan Malin</a> at the <a href="The%20Establishment%20%28club%29">Establishment club</a> in Soho in 1963. The following year he moved out of his marital house, and that day proposed to Joan, who accepted his offer. Le Mesurier allowed Jacques to bring a divorce suit on grounds of his own infidelity, to ensure that the press blamed him for the break-up, thus avoiding any negative publicity for Jacques. Le Mesurier and Malin married in March 1966. A few months after they were married, Joan began a relationship with Tony Hancock, and left Le Mesurier to move in with the comedian. Hancock was a self-confessed alcoholic by this time, and was verbally and physically abusive to Joan during their relationship. After a year together, with Hancock's violence towards her worsening, Joan attempted suicide; she subsequently realised that she could no longer live with Hancock and returned to her husband. Despite this, Le Mesurier remained friends with Hancock, calling him "a comic of true genius, capable of great warmth and generosity, but a tormented and unhappy man". Without Le Mesurier's knowledge, Joan resumed her affair with Hancock and, when the comic moved to Australia in 1968, she planned to follow him if he was able to overcome his alcoholism. She abandoned these plans and remained with Le Mesurier after Hancock committed suicide on 25 June 1968.
Le Mesurier was a heavy drinker, but was never noticeably drunk. In 1977 he collapsed in Australia and flew home, where he was diagnosed with <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a> of the liver and ordered to stop drinking. Until then he had not considered himself an alcoholic; he accepted that "it was the cumulative effect over the years that had done the damage". It was a year and a half before he drank alcohol again, when he avoided spirits and drank only beer. Jacques claimed that his calculated vagueness was the result of his dependence on <a href="Cannabis%20%28drug%29">cannabis</a>, although according to Le Mesurier the drug was not to his taste; he smoked it only during his period of abstinence from alcohol. Le Mesurier's favoured pastime was visiting the jazz clubs around Soho, such as <a href="Ronnie%20Scott%27s%20Jazz%20Club">Ronnie Scott's</a>, and he observed that "listening to artists like <a href="Bill%20Evans">Bill Evans</a>, <a href="Oscar%20Peterson">Oscar Peterson</a> or <a href="Alan%20Clare">Alan Clare</a> always made life seem that little bit brighter".

Towards the end of his life Le Mesurier wrote his autobiography, "A Jobbing Actor"; the book was published in 1984, after his death. Le Mesurier's health visibly declined from July 1983 when he was hospitalised for a short time after suffering a <a href="Bleeding">haemorrhage</a>. When the condition recurred later in the year he was taken to <a href="Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a> Hospital; after saying to his wife, "It's all been rather lovely", he slipped into a coma and died on 15 November 1983, aged 71. His remains were cremated, and the ashes buried at the Church of St. George the Martyr, Church Hill, Ramsgate. His <a href="epitaph">epitaph</a> reads: "John Le Mesurier. Much loved actor. Resting." His self-penned death notice in "The Times" of 16 November 1983 stated that he had "conked out" and that he "sadly misses family and friends".

After Le Mesurier's death fellow comedian <a href="Eric%20Sykes">Eric Sykes</a> commented: "I never heard a bad word said against him. He was one of the great <a href="wikt%3Adroll">drolls</a> of our time". Le Mesurier's fellow "Dad's Army" actor Bill Pertwee mourned the loss of his friend, saying, "It's a shattering loss. He was a great professional, very quiet but with a lovely sense of humour". Director <a href="Peter%20Cotes">Peter Cotes</a>, writing in "The Guardian", called him one of Britain's "most accomplished screen character actors", while "The Times" obituarist observed that he "could lend distinction to the smallest part".

"The Guardian" reflected on Le Mesurier's popularity, observing that "No wonder so many whose lives were very different from his own came to be so enormously fond of him". A memorial service was held on 16 February 1984 at the "Actors' Church", <a href="St%20Paul%27s%2C%20Covent%20Garden">St Paul's, Covent Garden</a>, at which Bill Pertwee gave the eulogy.

Le Mesurier took a relaxed approach to acting, saying, "You know the way you get jobbing gardeners? Well, I'm a jobbing actor ... as long as they pay me I couldn't care less if my name is billed above or below the title". Le Mesurier played a wide range of parts, and became known as "an indispensable figure in the gallery of second-rank players which were the glory of the British film industry in its more prolific days". He felt his characterisations owed "a lot to my customary expression of bewildered innocence" and tried to stress for many of his roles that his parts were those of "a decent chap all at sea in a chaotic world not of his own making".

<a href="Philip%20French">Philip French</a> of "The Observer" considered that when playing a representative of bureaucracy, Le Mesurier "registered something ... complex. A feeling of exasperation, disturbance, anxiety [that] constantly lurked behind that handsome bloodhound face". The impression he gave in these roles became an "inimitable brand of bewildered persistence under fire which Le Mesurier made his own". "The Times" noted of him that although he was best known for his comedic roles, he, "could be equally effective in straight parts", as evidenced by his BAFTA-award-winning role in "Traitor". Director Peter Cotes agreed, adding, "he had depths unrealised through the mechanical pieces in which he generally appeared"; while <a href="Philip%20Oakes">Philip Oakes</a> considered that, "single-handed, he has made more films watchable, even absorbing, than anyone else around".

Le Mesurier's second and third marriages have been the subject of two <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a> biographical films, the 2008 "<a href="Hancock%20and%20Joan">Hancock and Joan</a>" on Joan Le Mesurier's affair with Tony Hancock—with Le Mesurier played by <a href="Alex%20Jennings">Alex Jennings</a>—and the 2011 "<a href="Hattie%20%28film%29">Hattie</a>" on Jacques's affair with John Schofield—with Le Mesurier played by <a href="Robert%20Bathurst">Robert Bathurst</a>. In "We're Doomed! The Dad's Army Story", a 2015 comedy drama about the making of "Dad's Army", Le Mesurier was portrayed by <a href="Julian%20Sands">Julian Sands</a>.

Pierre Monteux

Pierre Benjamin Monteux (; 4 April 18751 July 1964) was a French (later American) <a href="conducting">conductor</a>. After violin and <a href="viola">viola</a> studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907. He came to prominence when, for <a href="Sergei%20Diaghilev">Sergei Diaghilev</a>'s <a href="Ballets%20Russes">Ballets Russes</a> company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a>'s "<a href="The%20Rite%20of%20Spring">The Rite of Spring</a>" and other prominent works including "<a href="Petrushka%20%28ballet%29">Petrushka</a>", <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Ravel</a>'s "<a href="Daphnis%20et%20Chlo%C3%A9">Daphnis et Chloé</a>", and <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Debussy</a>'s "<a href="Jeux">Jeux</a>". Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century.

From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a> in New York. He led the <a href="Boston%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Boston Symphony Orchestra</a> (1919–24), <a href="Royal%20Concertgebouw%20Orchestra">Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra</a> (1924–34), <a href="Orchestre%20Symphonique%20de%20Paris">Orchestre Symphonique de Paris</a> (1929–38) and <a href="San%20Francisco%20Symphony">San Francisco Symphony</a> (1936–52). In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a>, a post which he held until his death three years later. Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a>. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records.

Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in <a href="Les%20Baux-de-Provence">Les Baux</a> in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded <a href="Pierre%20Monteux%20School">a school</a> for conductors and orchestral musicians in <a href="Hancock%2C%20Maine">Hancock, Maine</a>. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were <a href="Lorin%20Maazel">Lorin Maazel</a>, <a href="Igor%20Markevitch">Igor Markevitch</a>, <a href="Neville%20Marriner">Neville Marriner</a>, <a href="Seiji%20Ozawa">Seiji Ozawa</a>, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Previn">André Previn</a> and <a href="David%20Zinman">David Zinman</a>. The school in Hancock has continued since Monteux's death.

Pierre Monteux was born in Paris, the third son and the fifth of six children of Gustave Élie Monteux, a shoe salesman, and his wife, Clémence Rebecca "née" Brisac. The Monteux family was descended from <a href="Sephardic">Sephardic</a> Jews who settled in the south of France. The Monteux ancestors included at least one <a href="rabbi">rabbi</a>, but Gustave Monteux and his family were not religious. Among Monteux's brothers were <a href="Henri%20Monteux">Henri</a>, who became an actor, and Paul, who became a conductor of light music under the name Paul Monteux-Brisac. Gustave Monteux was not musical, but his wife was a graduate of the Conservatoire de Musique de Marseille and gave piano lessons. Pierre took violin lessons from the age of six.
When he was nine years old Monteux was admitted to the <a href="Conservatoire%20de%20Paris">Conservatoire de Paris</a>. He studied the violin with <a href="Jules%20Garcin">Jules Garcin</a> and <a href="Henri%20Berthelier">Henri Berthelier</a>, composition with <a href="Charles%20Lenepveu">Charles Lenepveu</a>, and harmony and theory with <a href="Albert%20Lavignac">Albert Lavignac</a>. His fellow violin students included <a href="George%20Enescu">George Enescu</a>, <a href="Carl%20Flesch">Carl Flesch</a>, <a href="Fritz%20Kreisler">Fritz Kreisler</a> and <a href="Jacques%20Thibaud">Jacques Thibaud</a>. Among the piano students at the Conservatoire was <a href="Alfred%20Cortot">Alfred Cortot</a>, with whom he developed a lifelong friendship. At the age of twelve, Monteux organised and conducted a small orchestra of Conservatoire students to accompany Cortot in performances of concertos in and around Paris. He attended the world premiere of <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Franck">César Franck</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20in%20D%20minor%20%28Franck%29">Symphony</a> in February 1889. From 1889 to 1892, while still a student, he played in the orchestra of the <a href="Folies%20Berg%C3%A8re">Folies Bergère</a>; he later said to <a href="George%20Gershwin">George Gershwin</a> that his rhythmic sense was formed during the experience of playing popular dance music there.
At the age of fifteen, while continuing his violin studies, Monteux took up the <a href="viola">viola</a>. He studied privately with <a href="Benjamin%20Godard">Benjamin Godard</a>, with whom he performed in the premiere of <a href="Camille%20Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Saint-Saëns</a>'s Septet, with the composer at the keyboard. Monteux joined the Geloso Quartet as violist; he played many concerts with them, including a performance of <a href="Gabriel%20Faur%C3%A9">Fauré</a>'s Second Piano Quartet with the composer at the piano. On another occasion he was the violist in a private performance of a <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a> quartet given before the composer in Vienna. Monteux recalled Brahms's remark, "It takes the French to play my music properly. The Germans all play it much too heavily." Monteux remained a member of the Geloso Quartet until 1911. With Johannes Wolff and Joseph Hollman he also played chamber music for <a href="Edvard%20Grieg">Grieg</a>. Years later, in his seventies, Monteux deputised with the <a href="Budapest%20String%20Quartet">Budapest Quartet</a> without rehearsal or score; asked by <a href="Erik%20Smith">Erik Smith</a> if he could write out the parts of the seventeen Beethoven quartets, he replied, "You know, I cannot forget them."

In 1893, when he was eighteen, Monteux married a fellow student, the pianist Victoria Barrière. With her he played the complete Beethoven violin sonatas in public. Neither family approved of the marriage; although the Monteux family were not religious, both they and the Roman Catholic Barrières were doubtful about an <a href="interfaith%20marriage">inter-religious marriage</a>; furthermore, both families thought the couple too young to marry. There were a son and a daughter from the union.

During his formative years Monteux belonged to a group which toured with the <a href="Casadesus">Casadesus</a> family of musicians and the pianist <a href="Alfredo%20Casella">Alfredo Casella</a>. The combination played supposed "ancient pieces", allegedly discovered in libraries by one or other of the Casadesus family; <a href="Marius%20Casadesus">Marius Casadesus</a> later revealed that he or his brother <a href="Henri%20Casadesus">Henri</a> had written the music. While still a student, in 1893 Monteux was successful in the competition for the chair of first viola of the <a href="Concerts%20Colonne">Concerts Colonne</a>, of which he became assistant conductor and choirmaster the following year. This gave him a link via the orchestra's founder, <a href="%C3%89douard%20Colonne">Édouard Colonne</a>, to <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a>. Colonne had known Berlioz, and through the older conductor Monteux was able to mark his scores with notes based on the composer's intentions. He was also employed on a freelance basis at the <a href="Op%C3%A9ra-Comique">Opéra-Comique</a>, where he continued to play from time to time for several years; he led the viola section at the 1902 premiere of "<a href="Pell%C3%A9as%20et%20M%C3%A9lisande%20%28opera%29">Pelléas et Mélisande</a>" under the baton of <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Messager">André Messager</a>. In 1896 he graduated from the Conservatoire, sharing first prize for violin with Thibaud.

Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a> "La lyre et la harpe", to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of "Oui – Monteux!". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.

Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's "grandes écoles", he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as "the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.

Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. <a href="Hans%20Richter%20%28conductor%29">Hans Richter</a> invited him to lead the violas in the <a href="Bayreuth%20Festival">Bayreuth Festival</a> orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's "<a href="Harold%20en%20Italie">Harold in Italy</a>", rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by <a href="Felix%20Mottl">Felix Mottl</a>. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the <a href="Dieppe%2C%20Seine-Maritime">Dieppe</a> casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of <a href="Arthur%20Nikisch">Arthur Nikisch</a>, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.

For some time, Monteux's marriage had been under strain, exacerbated by his wife's frequent absences on concert tours. The couple were divorced in 1909; Monteux married one of her former pupils, Germaine Benedictus, the following year.

Monteux continued to play in the Concerts Colonne through the first decade of the century. In 1910 Colonne died and was succeeded as principal conductor by <a href="Gabriel%20Piern%C3%A9">Gabriel Pierné</a>. As well as leading the violas, Monteux was assistant conductor, taking charge of early rehearsals and acting as chorus master for choral works. In 1910 the orchestra was engaged to play for a Paris season given by <a href="Sergei%20Diaghilev">Sergei Diaghilev</a>'s ballet company, the <a href="Ballets%20Russes">Ballets Russes</a>. Monteux played under Pierné in the world premiere of <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a>'s "<a href="The%20Firebird">The Firebird</a>". In 1911 Diaghilev engaged <a href="Nikolai%20Tcherepnin">Nikolai Tcherepnin</a> to conduct the premiere of Stravinsky's "<a href="Petrushka%20%28ballet%29">Petrushka</a>". Monteux conducted the preliminary rehearsals before Tcherepnin arrived; Stravinsky was so impressed that he insisted that Monteux conduct the premiere.
"Petrushka" was part of a triple bill, all conducted by Monteux. The other two pieces were "<a href="Le%20Spectre%20de%20la%20Rose">Le Spectre de la Rose</a>" and "Scheherazade", a balletic adaptation of <a href="Nikolai%20Rimsky-Korsakov">Rimsky-Korsakov</a>'s symphonic suite of the <a href="Scheherazade%20%28Rimsky-Korsakov%29">same name</a>. The three works were choreographed by <a href="Michel%20Fokine">Fokine</a>. In later years Monteux disapproved of the appropriation of symphonic music for ballets, but he made an exception for "Scheherazade", and, as his biographer John Canarina observes, at that stage in his career his views on the matter carried little weight. "Petrushka" was a success with the public and with all but the most diehard conservative critics.

Following the Paris season Diaghilev appointed Monteux principal conductor for a tour of Europe in late 1911 and early 1912. It began with a five-week season at the <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Royal Opera House</a> in London. The press notices concentrated on the dancers, who included <a href="Anna%20Pavlova">Anna Pavlova</a> as well as the regular stars of the Ballets Russes, but Monteux received some words of praise. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" commented on the excellent unanimity he secured from the players, apart from "occasional uncertainty in the changes of "tempo"."

After its season in London the company performed in Vienna, Budapest, Prague and Berlin. The tour was successful, artistically and financially, but was not without untoward incident. A planned visit to St Petersburg had to be cancelled because the Narodny Dom theatre burned down, and in Vienna the <a href="Vienna%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Philharmonic</a> was unequal to the difficulties of the score of "Petrushka". The illustrious orchestra revolted at the rehearsal for the first performance, refusing to play for Monteux; only an intervention by Diaghilev restored the rehearsal, by the end of which Monteux was applauded and Stravinsky given an ovation. In the middle of the tour Monteux was briefly summoned back to Paris by the Concerts Colonne, which had the contractual right to recall him, to deputise for Pierné; his own deputy, <a href="D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9-%C3%89mile%20Inghelbrecht">Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht</a>, took temporary musical charge of the Ballets Russes.

In May 1912 Diaghilev's company returned to Paris. Monteux was the conductor for the two outstanding works of the season, <a href="Vaslav%20Nijinsky">Vaslav Nijinsky</a>'s ballet version of <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Debussy</a>'s "<a href="Afternoon%20of%20a%20Faun%20%28Nijinsky%29">Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune</a>", made with the composer's approval, and Fokine's "<a href="Daphnis%20et%20Chlo%C3%A9">Daphnis et Chloé</a>" to a score commissioned from <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Ravel</a>. Monteux later recalled "Debussy was behind me when we played "L'après midi d'un faune" because he did not want anything in his score to be changed on account of the dancing. And when we came to a forte, he said 'Monteux, that is a forte, play forte'. He did not want anything shimmering. And he wanted everything exactly in time".

In February and March 1913 the Ballets Russes presented another London season. As in 1911, the local orchestra engaged was the Beecham Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra's founder, <a href="Thomas%20Beecham">Thomas Beecham</a>, shared the conducting with Monteux. At the end of February Beecham had to take over "Petrushka" when Monteux suddenly hastened to Paris for four days to be with his wife on the birth of their daughter, Denise.

During the 1913 Ballets Russes season in Paris, Monteux conducted two more premieres. The first was "<a href="Jeux">Jeux</a>", with music by Debussy and choreography by Nijinsky. The choreography was not liked; Monteux thought it "asinine", while Debussy felt that "Nijinsky's cruel and barbarous choreography ... trampled over my poor rhythms like so many weeds". The second new work was Stravinsky's "<a href="The%20Rite%20of%20Spring">The Rite of Spring</a>" given under the French title, "Le sacre du printemps". Monteux had been appalled when Stravinsky first played the score at the piano:

Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the <a href="Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20des%20Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es">Théâtre des Champs-Élysées</a> to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, "I did not like "Le Sacre" then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now." However, he told his wife in 1963 that the "Rite" was "now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of "Le Sacre" this spring".

The dress rehearsal, with Debussy, Ravel, other musicians and critics among those present, passed without incident. However, the following evening the premiere provoked something approaching a riot, with loud verbal abuse of the work, counter-shouts from supporters, and fisticuffs breaking out. Monteux pressed on, continuing to conduct the orchestra regardless of the turmoil behind him. Stravinsky wrote "The image of Monteux's back is more vivid in my mind today than the picture of the stage. He stood there apparently impervious and as nerveless as a crocodile. It is still incredible to me that he actually brought the orchestra through to the end." The extensive press coverage of the incident made Monteux "at age thirty-eight, truly a famous conductor". The company presented the "Rite" during its London season a few weeks later. "The Times" reported that although there was "something like a hostile reception" at the first London performance, the final performance in the season "was received with scarcely a sign of opposition". Before the 1913 London performances, Monteux challenged Diaghilev's authority by declaring that he, not the impresario, was the composer's representative in matters related to "The Rite of Spring".

Monteux believed that most of the anger aroused by the work was due not to the music but to Nijinsky's choreography, described by Stravinsky as "knock-kneed and long-haired Lolitas jumping up and down". With the composer's agreement Monteux presented a concert performance in Paris in April 1914. Saint-Saëns, who was present, declared Stravinsky mad and left in a rage, but he was almost alone in his dislike. At the end Stravinsky was carried shoulder-high from the theatre after what he described as "the most beautiful performance that I have had of the "Sacre du printemps"". That performance was part of a series of "Concerts Monteux", presented between February and April 1914, in which Monteux conducted the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in a wide range of symphonic and <a href="concertante">concertante</a> works, including the concert premiere of the orchestral version of Ravel's <a href="Valses%20nobles%20et%20sentimentales%20%28Ravel%29">"Valses nobles et sentimentales"</a>. His last notable engagement before the outbreak of war was as conductor of the premiere of Stravinsky's opera "<a href="The%20Nightingale%20%28opera%29">The Nightingale</a>" at the <a href="Palais%20Garnier">Palais Garnier</a>.

After the outbreak of the First World War Monteux was again conscripted into the army, serving as a private in the 35th Territorial Regiment, with which he saw action in the trenches at <a href="Battle%20of%20Verdun">Verdun</a>, Soissons and the Argonne. He later described much of this period as one of "filth and boredom", although he formed a scratch band to divert his fellow soldiers. After just over two years on active service he was released from military duties after Diaghilev prevailed on the French government to second Monteux to conduct the Ballets Russes on a North American tour. The tour took in fifty-four cities in the US and Canada. In New York in 1916 Monteux refused to conduct Nijinsky's new ballet "Till Eulenspiegel" as the music was by a German – <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a> – so a conductor had to be engaged for those performances. At the end of the tour Monteux was offered a three-year contract to conduct the French repertoire at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a> in New York, and received the permission of the French government to remain in the US.

At the Met (as the Metropolitan Opera is generally called), Monteux conducted familiar French works such as "<a href="Faust%20%28opera%29">Faust</a>", "<a href="Carmen">Carmen</a>" and "<a href="Samson%20and%20Delilah%20%28opera%29">Samson and Delilah</a>", with singers including <a href="Enrico%20Caruso">Enrico Caruso</a>, <a href="Geraldine%20Farrar">Geraldine Farrar</a>, <a href="Louise%20Homer">Louise Homer</a> and <a href="Giovanni%20Martinelli">Giovanni Martinelli</a>. Of his first appearance, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" said, "Mr. Monteux conducted with skill and authority. He made it evident that he had ample knowledge of the score and control of the orchestra – an unmistakably rhythmic beat, a sense of dramatic values."
Monteux conducted the American premieres of Rimsky-Korsakov's "<a href="The%20Golden%20Cockerel">The Golden Cockerel</a>", and <a href="Henri%20Rabaud">Henri Rabaud</a>'s "<a href="M%C3%A2rouf%2C%20savetier%20du%20Caire">Mârouf, savetier du Caire</a>". The American premiere of "Petrushka", in a new production by, and starring, <a href="Adolph%20Bolm">Adolph Bolm</a>, was in an unusual opera-ballet double bill with "<a href="La%20traviata">La traviata</a>". Monteux's performances were well received, but, though he later returned to the Met as a guest, opera did not loom large in his career. He said, "I love conducting opera. The only trouble is that I hate the atmosphere of the opera house, where only too often music is the least of many considerations, from staging to the temperaments of the principal singers." Nor was he drawn to further engagements as a ballet conductor: "it offers special problems of fitting in with the dances and the dancers, most of whom, I'm sorry to say, seem to have musical appreciation confined to an ability to count beats." Nonetheless he occasionally conducted ballet performances, and even in his concert performances of the ballet scores he had conducted for Diaghilev he said he always had the dancers in his mind's eye.

In 1919 Monteux was appointed chief conductor of the <a href="Boston%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Boston Symphony Orchestra</a>. The orchestra was going through difficult times; its conductor, <a href="Karl%20Muck">Karl Muck</a>, had been forced by anti-German agitation to step down in 1917. <a href="Henry%20Wood">Sir Henry Wood</a> turned down the post, and despite press speculation neither <a href="Sergei%20Rachmaninoff">Sergei Rachmaninoff</a> nor <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a> was appointed. At least twenty-four players of German heritage had been forced out with Muck, and orchestral morale was low. Shortly before Monteux took up the conductorship the autocratic founder and proprietor of the orchestra, <a href="Henry%20Lee%20Higginson">Henry Lee Higginson</a>, died. He had steadfastly resisted <a href="Trade%20union">unionisation</a>, and after his death a substantial minority of the players resumed the struggle for union recognition. More than thirty players, including two important principals, resigned over the matter. Monteux set about rebuilding the orchestra, auditioning players from all kinds of musical background, some of whom had not played symphonic music before. By the end of his first season he had restored the orchestra to something approaching its normal complement. He trained the orchestra to a high standard; according to the critic <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a>, Monteux's musicianship "made the Boston Symphony Orchestra the most refined and musical in the world."

Monteux regularly introduced new compositions in Boston, often works by American, English and French composers. He was proud of the number of novelties presented in his years at Boston, and expressed pleasure that his successors continued the practice. He was dismayed when it was announced that his contract would not be renewed after 1924. The official explanation was that the orchestra's policy had always been to appoint conductors for no more than five years. It is unclear whether that was genuinely the reason. One suggested possibility is that the conductor chosen to replace him, <a href="Serge%20Koussevitzky">Serge Koussevitzky</a>, was thought more charismatic, with greater box-office appeal. Another is that the primmer members of Boston society disapproved of Monteux's morals: he and his second wife had gradually drifted apart and by 1924 he was living with Doris Hodgkins, an American divorcée, and her two children. They were unable to marry until 1928, when Germaine Monteux finally agreed to a divorce.

In 1924, Monteux began a ten-year association with the <a href="Concertgebouw%20Orchestra">Concertgebouw Orchestra</a> of Amsterdam, serving as "first conductor" (""eerste dirigent"") alongside <a href="Willem%20Mengelberg">Willem Mengelberg</a>, its long-serving chief conductor. The two musicians liked and respected one another, despite the difference in their approach to music-making: Monteux was scrupulous in his adherence to a composer's score and straightforward in his performances, while Mengelberg was well known for his virtuoso, sometimes wilful, interpretations and his cavalier attitude to the score ("Ve vill make some changements", as an English player quoted him). Their preferred repertoire overlapped in some of the classics, but Mengelberg had his own favourites from <a href="J.S.%20Bach">Bach</a>'s "<a href="St.%20Matthew%20Passion">St. Matthew Passion</a>" to <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Mahler</a> symphonies, and was happy to leave Debussy and Stravinsky to Monteux. Where their choices coincided, as in Beethoven, Brahms and Richard Strauss, Mengelberg was generous in giving Monteux at least his fair share of them.

While in Amsterdam Monteux conducted a number of operas, including "Pelléas et Mélisande" (its Dutch premiere), "Carmen", "<a href="Les%20Contes%20d%27Hoffmann">Les Contes d'Hoffmann</a>", a <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lully">Lully</a> and Ravel double bill of "<a href="Acis%20et%20Galat%C3%A9e">Acis et Galatée</a>" and "<a href="L%27Heure%20espagnole">L'Heure espagnole</a>", <a href="Christoph%20Willibald%20Gluck">Gluck</a>'s "<a href="Iphig%C3%A9nie%20en%20Tauride">Iphigénie en Tauride</a>" (also brought to the Paris Opéra) and <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi</a>'s "<a href="Falstaff%20%28opera%29">Falstaff</a>". Toscanini had been invited to conduct the last of these, but he told the promoters that Monteux was his dearest colleague and the best conductor for "Falstaff".

During the first eight years of his association with the Concertgebouw, Monteux conducted between fifty and sixty concerts each season. In his final two years with the orchestra other conductors, notably the rising young Dutchman <a href="Eduard%20van%20Beinum">Eduard van Beinum</a>, were allocated concerts that would previously have been given to Monteux, who amicably withdrew from his position in Amsterdam in 1934. He returned many times as a guest conductor.
In addition to his work with the Concertgebouw Orchestra, from 1929 Monteux conducted the <a href="Orchestre%20Symphonique%20de%20Paris">Orchestre Symphonique de Paris</a> (OSP), founded the previous year. The orchestral scene in Paris in the 1920s had been adversely affected by the "deputy" system, whereby any contracted orchestral player was at liberty, if a better engagement became available, to send a deputy to a rehearsal or even to a concert. In most other major cities in Europe and America this practice either had never existed or had been eradicated. Alongside the opera orchestras, four other Paris orchestras were competing for players. In 1928 the arts patron the <a href="Winnaretta%20Singer">Princesse de Polignac</a> combined with the fashion designer <a href="Coco%20Chanel">Coco Chanel</a> to propose a new orchestra, well enough paid to keep its players from taking conflicting engagements. With financial backing assured, they appointed a triumvirate of musicians – Cortot, <a href="Ernest%20Ansermet">Ernest Ansermet</a> and <a href="Louis%20Fourestier">Louis Fourestier</a> – to assemble the OSP. The following year Cortot invited Monteux to become the orchestra's artistic director and principal conductor. Ansermet, its initial musical director, was not pleased at being supplanted by a conductor of whom he was reportedly "ragingly jealous", but the composer <a href="Darius%20Milhaud">Darius Milhaud</a> commented on how much better the orchestra played for Monteux "since Ansermet has been sent back to his Swiss pastures".

Monteux considered the OSP one of the finest with which he worked. He conducted it until 1938, premiering many pieces, including <a href="Sergei%20Prokofiev">Prokofiev</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Prokofiev%29">Third Symphony</a> in 1929. The orchestra's generous funding in the first years allowed for ample rehearsals and adventurous programming, presenting contemporary music and the lesser-known works of earlier composers as well as the classic repertoire. In his first season Monteux conducted an all-Stravinsky concert, consisting of the suite from "The Firebird" and complete performances of "Petrushka" and "The Rite of Spring". The orchestra made European tours in 1930 and 1931, receiving enthusiastic receptions in the Netherlands and Germany. In Berlin the audience could not contain its applause until the end of the "<a href="Symphonie%20fantastique">Symphonie fantastique</a>", and in Monteux's words "went wild" after the slow movement, the "Scène aux champs". He approved of spontaneous applause, unlike <a href="Artur%20Schnabel">Artur Schnabel</a>, Sir Henry Wood and <a href="Leopold%20Stokowski">Leopold Stokowski</a>, who did all they could to stamp out the practice of clapping between movements.

After 1931 the OSP suffered the effects of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>; much of its funding ceased, and the orchestra reformed itself into a co-operative, pooling such meagre profits as it made. To give the players some extra work Monteux started a series of conducting classes in 1932. From 1936 he held the classes at his summer home in <a href="Les%20Baux-de-Provence">Les Baux</a> in Provence, the forerunner of the school he later set up in the US.

Monteux first conducted the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Symphony%20Orchestra">San Francisco Symphony Orchestra</a> (SFSO) in 1931, and in 1935 at the age of 60 he was offered the chief conductorship. He was doubtful about accepting, both on personal and on professional grounds. He did not want to leave the OSP, his wife did not want to live on the west coast of America, and the orchestra was so low in funds that it had been forced to cancel an entire season in 1934. Like most orchestras the SFSO had been badly hit financially by the depression, and it suffered the further difficulty that many of its former players had left for better-paid jobs in Hollywood studios. That problem was exacerbated by the insistence of the <a href="American%20Federation%20of%20Musicians">Musicians' Union</a> that only local players could be recruited. Monteux nevertheless accepted the appointment. The SFSO concert season was never longer than five months a year, which enabled him to continue working with the OSP, and allowed him to conduct the inaugural concert of the <a href="NBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra">NBC Symphony Orchestra</a> on 13 November 1937. In "The New York Times" Olin Downes wrote that the new orchestra was "of very high rank" and that the broadcast concert had displayed Monteux "at the height of his powers."

"The Times" said of Monteux's time in San Francisco that it had "incalculable effect on American musical culture", and gave him "the opportunity to expand his already substantial repertory, and by gradual, natural processes to deepen his understanding of his art." Monteux consistently programmed new or recent music. He generally avoided, as he did throughout his career, <a href="atonality">atonal</a> or <a href="serialism">serial</a> works, but his choice of modern works nevertheless drew occasional complaints from conservative-minded members of the San Francisco audience. Among guest conductors with the SFSO during Monteux's years were <a href="John%20Barbirolli">John Barbirolli</a>, Beecham, <a href="Otto%20Klemperer">Otto Klemperer</a>, Stokowski and Stravinsky. Soloists included the pianists George Gershwin, Rachmaninoff, <a href="Arthur%20Rubinstein">Arthur Rubinstein</a> and Schnabel, the violinists <a href="Jascha%20Heifetz">Jascha Heifetz</a>, <a href="Yehudi%20Menuhin">Yehudi Menuhin</a> and the young <a href="Isaac%20Stern">Isaac Stern</a>, and singers such as <a href="Kirsten%20Flagstad">Kirsten Flagstad</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Kipnis">Alexander Kipnis</a>.
Almost all his seventeen San Francisco seasons concluded with <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Beethoven%29">Beethoven's Ninth Symphony</a>. Monteux's SFSO studio recordings were mainly made in the cavernous acoustics of <a href="War%20Memorial%20Opera%20House">War Memorial Opera House</a> (without an audience) with the music transmitted over telephone wires to a Los Angeles studio and recorded on film there. Confined to the US for the years of the Second World War, in 1942 Monteux took American citizenship.

Monteux wished to continue his work in helping young conductors: "Conducting is not enough. I must create something. I am not a composer, so I will create fine young musicians." In addition to his classes in Paris and Les Baux in the 1930s he had given private lessons to <a href="Igor%20Markevitch">Igor Markevitch</a>; later private students included <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Previn">André Previn</a>, <a href="Seiji%20Ozawa">Seiji Ozawa</a>, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Serebrier">José Serebrier</a> and <a href="Robert%20Shaw%20%28conductor%29">Robert Shaw</a>. Previn called him "the kindest, wisest man I can remember, and there was nothing about conducting he didn't know." After a performance conducted by Previn, Monteux said to him, "Did you think the orchestra was playing well? ... So did I. Next time don't interfere with them." Previn said that he never forgot this advice. Monteux's best-known undertaking as a teacher was the <a href="Pierre%20Monteux%20School">Pierre Monteux School</a> for conductors and orchestral musicians, held each summer at his home in <a href="Hancock%2C%20Maine">Hancock, Maine</a> from 1943 onwards. Internationally known alumni of the school include <a href="Leon%20Fleisher">Leon Fleisher</a>, <a href="Erich%20Kunzel">Erich Kunzel</a>, <a href="Lorin%20Maazel">Lorin Maazel</a>, <a href="Neville%20Marriner">Neville Marriner</a>, <a href="Hugh%20Wolff">Hugh Wolff</a> and <a href="David%20Zinman">David Zinman</a>. Other Monteux students included John Canarina, whose 2003 biography was the first full-length study of the conductor in English, <a href="Charles%20Bruck">Charles Bruck</a>, one of Monteux's first pupils in Paris, who became music director of the school in Hancock after Monteux's death, and <a href="Emanuel%20Leplin">Emanuel Leplin</a>.

Monteux appeared as guest conductor with many orchestras; he commented in 1955, "I regret they don't have symphony orchestras all over the world so I could see Burma and Samarkand". His successor with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Serge Koussevitzky, invited many guest conductors during his twenty-five years in charge; Monteux was never among them, probably, in Canarina's view, because of Koussevitzky's jealousy. In 1949 Koussevitzky was succeeded by <a href="Charles%20Munch%20%28conductor%29">Charles Munch</a>, whose early career had been boosted by an invitation from Monteux to conduct the Orchestre Symphonique de Paris in 1933. Munch invited Monteux to Boston as a guest conductor in the 1951 season. The engagement was greeted with enthusiasm by the critics and the public, and Munch invited Monteux to join him the following year in heading the orchestra's first European tour. The high point of the tour was a performance under Monteux of "The Rite of Spring" at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées, in the presence of the composer. Monteux returned annually to Boston every year until his death.

For some time Monteux had felt that he should leave the SFSO. He had two main reasons: he believed that a conductor should not remain in one post for too long, and he wished to be free to accept more invitations to appear with other orchestras. He resigned from the SFSO at the end of the 1952 season. He briefly reappeared on the podium at the War Memorial Opera House within a year, as co-conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra's coast-to-coast American tour, at Munch's invitation. Almost all the members of the SFSO were in the audience, and joined in the ovation given to their former chief.

After an absence of thirty-four years, Monteux was invited to conduct at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 1953. The opera chosen was "Faust", which he had conducted at his debut at the house in 1917. The production had what Canarina calls "a stellar cast" headed by <a href="Jussi%20Bj%C3%B6rling">Jussi Björling</a>, <a href="Victoria%20de%20los%20%C3%81ngeles">Victoria de los Ángeles</a>, <a href="Nicola%20Rossi-Lemeni">Nicola Rossi-Lemeni</a> and <a href="Robert%20Merrill">Robert Merrill</a>, but the critics, including <a href="Virgil%20Thomson">Virgil Thomson</a> and <a href="Irving%20Kolodin">Irving Kolodin</a>, reserved their highest praise for Monteux's conducting. Between 1953 and 1956 Monteux returned to the Met for "Pelléas et Mélisande", "Carmen", "<a href="Manon">Manon</a>", "<a href="Orfeo%20ed%20Euridice">Orfeo ed Euridice</a>", "The Tales of Hoffmann" and "Samson et Dalila". The Met at that time typecast conductors according to their nationality, and, as a Frenchman, Monteux was not offered any Italian operas. When his request to be engaged for "La traviata" in the 1956–57 season was refused he severed his ties with the house.

Since his first visit to London with the Ballets Russes in 1911, Monteux had had a "love affair with London and with British musicians". He had conducted for the fledgling <a href="BBC">BBC</a> in an orchestral concert at <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Covent Garden</a> in 1924, where he conducted the first public performance of the BBC Wireless Orchestra, and for the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Royal Philharmonic Society</a> at the <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a> in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1932 he was one of four conductors who took charge of the <a href="The%20Hall%C3%A9">Hallé Orchestra</a> in Manchester in the absence of its principal conductor; the other three substitutes were <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Sir Edward Elgar</a>, Beecham and the young Barbirolli. The Hallé players were immensely impressed with Monteux, and said that his orchestral technique and knowledge easily beat those of most other conductors. In 1951 he conducted the <a href="BBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra">BBC Symphony Orchestra</a> in a concert of <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>, Beethoven and <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k">Bartók</a> in the new <a href="Royal%20Festival%20Hall">Royal Festival Hall</a>, and made further appearances with London orchestras during the rest of the 1950s. He would have made more but for Britain's strict quarantine laws, which prevented the Monteuxs from bringing their pet French poodle with them; Doris Monteux would not travel without the poodle, and Monteux would not travel without his wife.

In June 1958 Monteux conducted the <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a> (LSO) in three concerts, described by the orchestra's historian <a href="Richard%20Morrison%20%28music%20critic%29">Richard Morrison</a> as "a sensation with players, press and public alike." The first concert included Elgar's "<a href="Enigma%20Variations">Enigma Variations</a>", in which Cardus judged Monteux to be more faithful to Elgar's conception than English conductors generally were. Cardus added, "After the performance of the 'Enigma' Variations, the large audience cheered and clapped Monteux for several minutes. This applause, moreover, broke out just before the interval. English audiences are not as a rule inclined to waste time applauding at or during an interval: they usually have other things to do." Monteux considered British concertgoers "the most attentive in the world", and British music critics "the most intelligent". However, a disadvantage of conducting a London orchestra was having to perform at the Festival Hall, of which he shared with Beecham and other conductors an intense dislike: "from the conductor's rostrum it is impossible to hear the violins".

Monteux's later London performances were not only with the LSO. In 1960 he conducted Beecham's <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Royal Philharmonic Orchestra</a> performing "feats of wizardry" in works by Beethoven, Debussy and <a href="Paul%20Hindemith">Hindemith</a>. The LSO offered him the post of principal conductor in 1961, when he was eighty-six; he accepted, on condition that he had a contract for twenty-five years, with an option of renewal. His large and varied repertoire was displayed in his LSO concerts. In addition to the French repertoire with which, to his occasional irritation, he was generally associated, he programmed Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and Wagner, as well as later composers including <a href="Enrique%20Granados">Granados</a>, <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Schoenberg</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Scriabin">Scriabin</a>, <a href="Dmitri%20Shostakovich">Shostakovich</a>, <a href="Jean%20Sibelius">Sibelius</a>, Richard Strauss and <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Vaughan Williams</a>. With the LSO, Monteux gave a fiftieth anniversary performance of "The Rite of Spring" at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> in the presence of the composer. Although the recording of the occasion reveals some lapses of ensemble and slack rhythms, it was an intense and emotional concert, and Monteux climbed up to Stravinsky's box to embrace him at the end. Players believed that in his few years in charge he transformed the LSO; Neville Marriner felt that he "made them feel like an international orchestra ... He gave them extended horizons and some of his achievements with the orchestra, both at home and abroad, gave them quite a different constitution."

Although Monteux retained his vitality to the end of his life, in his last years he suffered occasional collapses. In 1962 he fainted during a performance of Beethoven's <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Beethoven%29">Fifth Symphony</a>. In 1963 he collapsed again after being presented with the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society%23The%20Gold%20Medal">Gold Medal</a> of the Royal Philharmonic Society, Britain's highest musical honour. The presentation was made by <a href="Adrian%20Boult">Sir Adrian Boult</a>, who recalled that as they left the platform, "Monteux gave two little groans as we walked down the passage, and I suddenly found my arms full of violins and bows. The orchestra had recognized the signs. Their beloved chief was fainting." Monteux suffered another collapse the following year, and David Zinman and Lorin Maazel deputised for him at the Festival Hall.

In April 1964 Monteux conducted his last concert, which was in <a href="Milan">Milan</a> with the orchestra of <a href="RAI">Radiotelevisione italiana</a>. The programme consisted of the overture to "<a href="The%20Flying%20Dutchman%20%28opera%29">The Flying Dutchman</a>", Brahms's <a href="Double%20Concerto%20%28Brahms%29">Double Concerto</a> and Berlioz's "Symphonie fantastique". Unrealised plans included his debut at <a href="The%20Proms">The Proms</a>, and his 90th birthday concert, at which he intended to announce his retirement. In June 1964 Monteux suffered three strokes and a cerebral thrombosis at his home in Maine, where he died on 1 July at the age of 89.

Monteux had six children, two of them adopted. From his first marriage there were a son, Jean-Paul, and a daughter, Suzanne. Jean-Paul became a jazz musician, performing with artists such as <a href="Josephine%20Baker">Josephine Baker</a> and <a href="Mistinguett">Mistinguett</a>. His second marriage produced a daughter, Denise, later known as a sculptress, and a son, <a href="Claude%20Monteux">Claude</a>, a <a href="flautist">flautist</a>. After Monteux married Doris Hodgkins he legally adopted her two children, Donald, later a restaurateur, and Nancie, who after a career as a dancer became administrator of the Pierre Monteux School in Hancock.

Among Monteux's numerous honours, he was a Commandeur of the <a href="L%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur">Légion d'honneur</a> and a Knight of the <a href="Order%20of%20Oranje-Nassau">Order of Oranje-Nassau</a>. A political and social moderate, in the politics of his adopted homeland he supported the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> and was a strong opponent of racial discrimination. He ignored taboos on employing black artists; reportedly, during the days of segregation in the US, when told he could not be served in a restaurant "for colored folk" he insisted that he was coloured – pink.

The record producer <a href="John%20Culshaw">John Culshaw</a> described Monteux as "that rarest of beings – a conductor who was loved by his orchestras ... to call him a legend would be to understate the case." Toscanini observed that Monteux had the best baton technique he had ever seen. Like Toscanini, Monteux insisted on the traditional orchestral layout with first and second violins to the conductor's left and right, believing that this gave a better representation of string detail than grouping all the violins together on the left. On fidelity to composers' scores, Monteux's biographer John Canarina ranks him with Klemperer and above even Toscanini, whose reputation for strict adherence to the score was, in Canarina's view, less justified than Monteux's.

According to the biographical sketch in "<a href="Grove%20Dictionary%20of%20Music%20and%20Musicians">Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</a>", Monteux "was never an ostentatious conductor ... [he prepared] his orchestra in often arduous rehearsals and then [used] small but decisive gestures to obtain playing of fine texture, careful detail and powerful rhythmic energy, retaining to the last his extraordinary grasp of musical structure and a faultless ear for sound quality." Monteux was extremely economical with words and gestures and expected a response from his smallest movement. The record producer Erik Smith recalled of Monteux's rehearsals with the Vienna Philharmonic for Beethoven's <a href="Symphony%20No.%206%20%28Beethoven%29">Pastoral Symphony</a> and Brahms's <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Brahms%29">Second</a>, "although he could not speak to the orchestra in German, he transformed their playing from one take to the next".

The importance of rehearsal to Monteux was shown when, in 1923, Diaghilev asked him to conduct Stravinsky's new "<a href="Les%20noces">Les noces</a>" with no rehearsal, as the composer would already have conducted the first performance, Monteux following on from there. Monteux told the impresario "Stravinsky, 'e can do what 'e like, but I have to do what ze composer 'as written." Monteux's self-effacing approach to scores led to occasional adverse comment; the music critic of "<a href="The%20Nation">The Nation</a>", <a href="B.%20H.%20Haggin">B. H. Haggin</a>, while admitting that Monteux was generally regarded as one of the giants of conducting, wrote of his "repeatedly demonstrated musical mediocrity". Other American writers have taken a different view. In 1957 <a href="Carleton%20Smith">Carleton Smith</a> wrote, "His approach to all music is that of the master-craftsman. ... Seeing him at work, modest and quiet, it is difficult to realize that he is a bigger box office attraction at the Metropolitan Opera House than any prima donna ... that he is the only conductor regularly invited to take charge of America's 'big three' – the Boston, <a href="Philadelphia%20Orchestra">Philadelphia</a> and <a href="New%20York%20Philharmonic">New York Philharmonic</a> orchestras." In his 1967 book "The Great Conductors", <a href="Harold%20C.%20Schonberg">Harold C. Schonberg</a> wrote of Monteux, "[A] conductor of international stature, a conductor admired and loved all over the world. The word 'loved' is used advisedly." Elsewhere, Schonberg wrote of Monteux's "passion and charisma". When asked in a radio interview to describe himself (as a conductor) in one word, Monteux replied, "Damned professional".

Throughout his career Monteux suffered from being thought of as a specialist in French music. The music that meant most to him was that of German composers, particularly Brahms, but this was often overlooked by concert promoters and recording companies. Of the four Brahms symphonies, he was invited by the recording companies to record only one, the Second. Recordings of his live performances of the <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Brahms%29">First</a> and <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Brahms%29">Third</a> have been released on CD, but the discography in Canarina's biography lists no recording, live or from the studio, of the <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Brahms%29">Fourth</a>. The critic <a href="William%20Mann%20%28critic%29">William Mann</a>, along with many others, regarded him as a "supremely authoritative" conductor of Brahms, though Cardus disagreed: "In German music Monteux, naturally enough, missed harmonic weight and the right heavily lunged tempo. His rhythm, for example, was a little too pointed for, say, Brahms or Schumann." "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">Gramophone</a>"s reviewer Jonathan Swain contends that no conductor knew more than Monteux about expressive possibilities in the strings, claiming that "the conductor who doesn't play a stringed instrument simply doesn't know how to get the different sounds; and the bow has such importance in string playing that there are maybe 50 different ways of producing the same note"; In his 2003 biography, John Canarina lists nineteen "significant world premieres" conducted by Monteux. In addition to "Petrushka" and "The Rite of Spring" is a further Stravinsky work, "The Nightingale". Monteux's other premieres for Diaghilev included Ravel's "Daphnis et Chloé" and Debussy's "Jeux". In the concert hall he premiered works by, among others, Milhaud, <a href="Francis%20Poulenc">Poulenc</a> and Prokofiev. In a letter of April 1914 Stravinsky wrote "everyone can appreciate your zeal and your probity in regard to the contemporary works of various tendencies that you have had occasion to defend."

Monteux's biographer Jean-Philippe Mousnier analysed a representative sample of Monteux's programmes for more than 300 concerts. The symphonies played most frequently were César Franck's D minor Symphony, the "Symphonie fantastique", Beethoven's <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Beethoven%29">Seventh</a>, Tchaikovsky's <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Tchaikovsky%29">Fifth</a> and <a href="Symphony%20No.%206%20%28Tchaikovsky%29">Sixth</a>, and the first two symphonies of Brahms. Works by Richard Strauss featured almost as often as those of Debussy, and Wagner's Prelude and "Liebestod" from "<a href="Tristan%20und%20Isolde">Tristan und Isolde</a>" as often as "The Rite of Spring".

Monteux made a large number of recordings throughout his career. His first recording was as a <a href="viola">violist</a> in "Plus blanche que la blanche hermine" from "<a href="Les%20Huguenots">Les Huguenots</a>" by <a href="Giacomo%20Meyerbeer">Meyerbeer</a> in 1903 for <a href="Path%C3%A9%20Records">Pathé</a> with the tenor <a href="Albert%20Vaguet">Albert Vaguet</a>. It is possible that Monteux played in the Colonne Orchestra's 20 early cylinders recorded around 1906–07. His recording debut as a conductor was the first of his five recordings of "The Rite of Spring", issued in 1929. The first of these, with the OSP, is judged by Canarina to be indifferently played; recordings by Monteux of music by Ravel and Berlioz made in 1930 and 1931, Canarina believes, were more impressive. Stravinsky, who also recorded "The Rite" in 1929, was furious that Monteux had made a rival recording; he made vitriolic comments privately, and for some time his relations with Monteux remained cool.

Monteux's final studio recordings were with the London Symphony Orchestra in works by Ravel at the end of February 1964. In the course of his career he recorded works by more than fifty composers.
In Monteux's lifetime it was rare for record companies to issue recordings of live concerts, although he would much have preferred it, he said, "if one could record in one take in normal concert-hall conditions". Some live performances of Monteux conducting the Metropolitan Opera, and among others the San Francisco Symphony, Boston Symphony, BBC Symphony and London Symphony orchestras survive alongside his studio recordings, and some have been issued on compact disc. It has been argued that these reveal even more than his studio recordings "a conductor at once passionate, disciplined, and tasteful; one who was sometimes more vibrant than the Monteux captured in the studio, and yet, like that studio conductor, a cultivated musician possessing an extraordinary ear for balance, a keen sense of style and a sure grasp of shape and line."

Many of Monteux's recordings have remained in the catalogues for decades, notably his <a href="RCA%20Red%20Seal%20Records">RCA Victor</a> recordings with the Boston Symphony and <a href="Chicago%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Chicago Symphony</a> orchestras; <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca</a> recordings with the Vienna Philharmonic; and Decca and <a href="Philips%20Records">Philips</a> recordings with the LSO. Of "Manon", one of his few opera recordings, Alan Blyth in "Opera on Record" states "Monteux had the music in his blood and here dispenses it with authority and spirit". He can be heard rehearsing in the original LP issues of Beethoven's <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Beethoven%29">"Eroica" Symphony</a> with the Concertgebouw Orchestra (Philips 835132 AY) and Beethoven's 9th with the London Symphony (<a href="Westminster%20Records">Westminster</a>, WST 234).

Video recordings of Monteux are scarcer. He is seen conducting Berlioz's <a href="Roman%20Carnival%20Overture">Roman Carnival Overture</a> and <a href="Symphony%20No.%208%20%28Beethoven%29">Beethoven's 8th symphony</a> with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and Dukas' "<a href="L%27Apprenti%20sorcier">L'Apprenti sorcier</a>" with the London Symphony Orchestra in an "unshowy, deeply satisfying humane way".

Sir Georg Solti, (born György Stern; 21 October 1912 – 5 September 1997) was a Hungarian-born orchestral and operatic <a href="Conducting">conductor</a>, best known for his appearances with opera companies in Munich, Frankfurt and London, and as a long-serving music director of the <a href="Chicago%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Chicago Symphony Orchestra</a>. Born in <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a>, he studied there with <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k">Béla Bartók</a>, <a href="Le%C3%B3%20Weiner">Leó Weiner</a> and <a href="Ern%C5%91%20Dohn%C3%A1nyi">Ernő Dohnányi</a>. In the 1930s, he was a <a href="r%C3%A9p%C3%A9titeur">répétiteur</a> at the <a href="Hungarian%20State%20Opera%20House">Hungarian State Opera</a> and worked at the <a href="Salzburg%20Festival">Salzburg Festival</a> for <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a>. His career was interrupted by the rise of the <a href="Nazism">Nazis</a>' influence on Hungarian politics, and being of Jewish background he fled the <a href="Hungary%20between%20the%20World%20Wars%23On%20the%20eve%20of%20World%20War%20II">increasingly harsh Hungarian anti-Jewish laws</a> in 1938. After conducting a season of Russian ballet in London at the <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Royal Opera House</a> he found refuge in Switzerland, where he remained during the Second World War. Prohibited from conducting there, he earned a living as a pianist.

After the war, Solti was appointed musical director of the <a href="Bavarian%20State%20Opera">Bavarian State Opera</a> in Munich in 1946. In 1952 he moved to the <a href="Opern-%20und%20Schauspielhaus%20Frankfurt">Frankfurt Opera</a>, where he remained in charge for nine years. He took West German citizenship in 1953. In 1961 he became musical director of the <a href="The%20Royal%20Opera">Covent Garden Opera Company</a>, London. During his ten-year tenure, he introduced changes that raised standards to the highest international levels. Under his musical directorship the status of the company was recognised with the grant of the title "the Royal Opera". He became a British citizen in 1972.

In 1969 Solti became music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, a post he held for 22 years. He relinquished the position in 1991 and became the orchestra's music director laureate, a position he held until his death. During his time as the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's eighth music director, he also served as music director of the <a href="Orchestre%20de%20Paris">Orchestre de Paris</a> from 1972 until 1975 and principal conductor of the <a href="London%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">London Philharmonic Orchestra</a> from 1979 until 1983.

Known in his early years for the intensity of his music making, Solti was widely considered to have mellowed as a conductor in later years. He recorded many works two or three times at various stages of his career, and was a prolific recording artist, making more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. The most famous of his recordings is probably <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca</a>'s complete set of <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner's</a> "<a href="Der%20Ring%20des%20Nibelungen">Der Ring des Nibelungen</a>", made between 1958 and 1965. Solti's "Ring" has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, in polls for "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">Gramophone</a>" magazine in 1999 and the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s "<a href="BBC%20Music%20Magazine">Music Magazine</a>" in 2012. Solti was repeatedly honoured by the recording industry with awards throughout his career, including a record 31 <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s as a recording artist.

Solti was born György Stern on Maros utca, in the <a href="Hegyvid%C3%A9k">Hegyvidék</a> district of the <a href="Buda">Buda</a> side of Budapest. He was the younger of the two children of Teréz () and Móricz "Mor" Stern, both of whom were Jewish. In the aftermath of the First World War it became the accepted practice in Hungary for citizens with Germanic surnames to adopt Hungarian ones. The right wing regime of <a href="Mikl%C3%B3s%20Horthy">Admiral Horthy</a> enacted a series of <a href="Magyarisation">Hungarianisation</a> laws, including a requirement that state employees with foreign-sounding names must change them. Mor Stern, a self-employed merchant, felt no need to change his surname, but thought it prudent to change that of his children. He renamed them after <a href="Solt">Solt</a>, a small town in central Hungary. His son's given name, György, was acceptably Hungarian and was not changed.
Solti described his father as "a kind, sweet man who trusted everyone. He shouldn't have, but he did. Jews in Hungary were tremendously patriotic. In 1914, when war broke out, my father invested most of his money in a war loan to help the country. By the time the bonds matured, they were worthless." Mor Stern was a religious man, but his son was less so. Late in life Solti recalled, "I often upset him because I never stayed in the synagogue for longer than ten minutes." Teréz Stern was from a musical family, and encouraged her daughter Lilly, eight years the elder of the children, to sing, and György to accompany her at the piano. Solti remembered, "I made so many mistakes, but it was invaluable experience for an opera conductor. I learnt to swim with her." He was not a diligent student of the piano: "My mother kept telling me to practise, but what ten-year-old wants to play the piano when he could be out playing football?"

Solti enrolled at the Ernö Fodor School of Music in Budapest at the age of ten, transferring to the more prestigious <a href="Franz%20Liszt%20Academy%20of%20Music">Franz Liszt Academy</a> two years later. When he was 12 he heard a performance of <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Beethoven%29">Fifth Symphony</a> conducted by <a href="Erich%20Kleiber">Erich Kleiber</a>, which gave him the ambition to become a conductor. His parents could not afford to pay for years of musical education, and his rich uncles did not consider music a suitable profession; from the age of 13 Solti paid for his education by giving piano lessons.

The faculty of the Franz Liszt Academy included some of the most eminent Hungarian musicians, including <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k">Béla Bartók</a>, <a href="Le%C3%B3%20Weiner">Leó Weiner</a>, <a href="Ern%C5%91%20Dohn%C3%A1nyi">Ernő Dohnányi</a> and <a href="Zolt%C3%A1n%20Kod%C3%A1ly">Zoltán Kodály</a>. Solti studied under the first three, for piano, chamber music and composition respectively. Some sources state that he also studied with Kodály, but in his memoirs Solti recalled that Kodály, whom he would have preferred, turned him down, leaving him to study composition first with <a href="Albert%20Sikl%C3%B3s">Albert Siklós</a> and then with Dohnányi. Not all the Academy's tutors were equally distinguished: Solti remembered with little pleasure the conducting classes run by Ernö Unger, "who instructed his pupils to use rigid little wrist motions. I attended the class for only two years, but I needed five years of practical conducting experience before I managed to unlearn what he had taught me".

After graduating from the Academy in 1930 Solti was appointed to the staff of the <a href="Hungarian%20State%20Opera%20House">Hungarian State Opera</a>. He found that working as a <a href="r%C3%A9p%C3%A9titeur">répétiteur</a>, coaching singers in their roles and playing at rehearsals, was a more fruitful preparation than Unger's classes for his intended career as a conductor. In 1932 he went to <a href="Badisches%20Staatstheater%20Karlsruhe">Karlsruhe</a> in Germany as assistant to <a href="Josef%20Krips">Josef Krips</a>, but within a year, Krips, anticipating the imminent rise to power of <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Hitler</a> and the <a href="Nazism">Nazi</a>s, insisted that Solti should go home to Budapest, where at that time Jews were not in danger. Other Jewish and anti-Nazi musicians also left Germany for Budapest. Among other musical exiles with whom Solti worked there were <a href="Otto%20Klemperer">Otto Klemperer</a>, <a href="Fritz%20Busch">Fritz Busch</a>, and Kleiber. Before Austria fell under Nazi control, Solti was assistant to <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a> at the 1937 <a href="Salzburg%20Festival">Salzburg Festival</a>:

After further work as a répétiteur at the opera in Budapest, and with his standing enhanced by his association with Toscanini, Solti was given his first chance to conduct, on 11 March 1938. The opera was "<a href="The%20Marriage%20of%20Figaro">The Marriage of Figaro</a>". During that evening, news came of the German invasion of Austria. Many Hungarians feared that Hitler would next invade Hungary; he did not do so, but Horthy, to strengthen his partnership with the Nazis, instituted <a href="Hungary%20between%20the%20World%20Wars%23On%20the%20eve%20of%20World%20War%20II">anti-semitic laws</a>, mirroring the <a href="Nuremberg%20Laws">Nuremberg Laws</a>, restricting Hungary's Jews from engaging in professions. Solti's family urged him to move away. He went first to London, where he made his <a href="The%20Royal%20Opera">Covent Garden</a> debut, conducting the <a href="London%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">London Philharmonic</a> for a Russian ballet season. The reviewer in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" was not impressed with Solti's efforts, finding them "too violent, for he lashed at the orchestra and flogged the music so that he endangered the delicate, evocative atmosphere." At about this time Solti dropped the name "György" in favour of "Georg".

After his appearances in London Solti went to Switzerland to seek out Toscanini, who was conducting in <a href="Lucerne">Lucerne</a>. Solti hoped that Toscanini would help find him a post in the US. He was unable to do so, but Solti found work and security in Switzerland as vocal coach to the tenor Max Hirzel, who was learning the role of Tristan in <a href="Tristan%20und%20Isolde">Wagner's opera</a>. Throughout the Second World War, Solti remained in Switzerland. He did not see his father again: Mor Stern died of diabetes in a Budapest hospital in 1943. Solti was reunited with his mother and sister after the war. In Switzerland he could not obtain a work permit as a conductor, but earned his living as a piano teacher. After he won the 1942 <a href="Geneva%20International%20Music%20Competition">Geneva International Piano Competition</a> he was permitted to give piano recitals, but was still not allowed to conduct. During his exile, he met Hedwig (Hedi) Oeschli, daughter of a lecturer at Zürich University. They married in 1946. In his memoirs he wrote of her, "She was very elegant and sophisticated. ... Hedi gave me a little grace and taught me good manners – although she never completely succeeded in this. She also helped me enormously in my career".

With the end of the war Solti's luck changed dramatically. He was appointed musical director of the <a href="Bavarian%20State%20Opera">Bavarian State Opera</a> in <a href="Munich">Munich</a> in 1946. In normal circumstances this prestigious post would have been an unthinkable appointment for a young and inexperienced conductor, but the leading German conductors such as <a href="Wilhelm%20Furtw%C3%A4ngler">Wilhelm Furtwängler</a>, <a href="Clemens%20Krauss">Clemens Krauss</a> and <a href="Herbert%20von%20Karajan">Herbert von Karajan</a> were prohibited from conducting pending the conclusion of <a href="denazification">denazification</a> proceedings against them. Under Solti's direction, the company rebuilt its repertoire and began to recover its pre-war eminence. He benefited from the encouragement of the elderly <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>, in whose presence he conducted "<a href="Der%20Rosenkavalier">Der Rosenkavalier</a>". Strauss was reluctant to discuss his own music with Solti, but gave him advice about conducting.

In addition to the Munich appointment Solti gained a recording contract in 1946. He signed for <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca Records</a>, not as a conductor but as a piano accompanist. He made his first recording in 1947, playing <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a>'s <a href="Violin%20Sonata%20No.%201%20%28Brahms%29">First Violin Sonata</a> with the violinist <a href="Georg%20Kulenkampff">Georg Kulenkampff</a>. He was insistent that he wanted to conduct, and Decca gave him his first recording sessions as a conductor later in the same year, with the <a href="Zurich%20Tonhalle%20Orchestra">Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra</a> in Beethoven's "<a href="Egmont%20%28Beethoven%29">Egmont</a>" overture. Twenty years later Solti said, "I'm sure it's a terrible record, because the orchestra was not very good at that time and I was so excited. It is horrible, surely horrible – but by now it has vanished." He had to wait two years for his next recording as a conductor. It was in London, <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Haydn</a>'s "<a href="Symphony%20No.%20103%20%28Haydn%29">Drum Roll</a>" symphony, in sessions produced by <a href="John%20Culshaw">John Culshaw</a>, with whose career Solti's became closely linked over the next two decades. Reviewing the record, "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">The Gramophone</a>" said, "The performance of the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Georg Solti (a fine conductor who is new to me) is remarkable for rhythmic playing, richness of tone, and clarity of execution." "<a href="The%20Record%20Guide">The Record Guide</a>" compared it favourably with <a href="EMI%20Classics">EMI</a>'s rival recording by <a href="Thomas%20Beecham">Sir Thomas Beecham</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Royal Philharmonic</a>.

In 1951 Solti conducted at the Salzburg Festival for the first time, partly through the influence of Furtwängler, who was impressed by him. The work was "<a href="Idomeneo">Idomeneo</a>", which had not been given there before. In Munich Solti achieved critical and popular success, but for political reasons his position at the State Opera was never secure. The view persisted that a German conductor should be in charge; pressure mounted, and after five years Solti accepted an offer to move to <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> in 1952 as musical director of the <a href="Opern-%20und%20Schauspielhaus%20Frankfurt">Frankfurt Opera</a>. The city's opera house had been destroyed in the war, and Solti undertook to build a new company and repertoire for its recently completed replacement. He also conducted the symphony concerts given by the opera orchestra. Frankfurt's was a less prestigious house than Munich's and he initially regarded the move as a demotion, but he found the post fulfilling and remained at Frankfurt from 1952 to 1961, presenting 33 operas, 19 of which he had not conducted before. Frankfurt, unlike Munich, could not attract many of the leading German singers. Solti recruited many rising young American singers such as <a href="Claire%20Watson">Claire Watson</a> and <a href="Sylvia%20Stahlman">Sylvia Stahlman</a>, to the extent that the house acquired the nickname "Amerikanische Oper am Main". In 1953 the West German government offered Solti German citizenship, which, being effectively stateless as a Hungarian exile, he gratefully accepted. He believed he could never return to Hungary, by then under communist rule. He remained a German citizen for two decades.

During his Frankfurt years Solti made appearances with other opera companies and orchestras. He conducted in the Americas for the first time in 1952, giving concerts in Buenos Aires. In the same year he made his debut at the <a href="Edinburgh%20Festival">Edinburgh Festival</a> as a guest conductor with the visiting <a href="Hamburg%20State%20Opera">Hamburg State Opera</a>. The following year he was a guest at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Opera">San Francisco Opera</a> with "<a href="Elektra%20%28opera%29">Elektra</a>", "<a href="Die%20Walk%C3%BCre">Die Walküre</a>" and "Tristan und Isolde". In 1954 he conducted "<a href="Don%20Giovanni">Don Giovanni</a>" at the <a href="Glyndebourne%20Festival%20Opera">Glyndebourne Festival</a>. The reviewer in "The Times" said that no fault could be found in Solti's "vivacious and sensitive" conducting. In the same year Solti made his first appearance with the <a href="Chicago%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Chicago Symphony Orchestra</a>, at the <a href="Ravinia%20Festival">Ravinia Festival</a>. In 1960 he made his debut at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a> in New York, conducting "Tannhäuser", and he continued to appear there until 1964.

In the recording studios Solti's career took off after 1956, when John Culshaw was put in charge of Decca's classical recording programme. Culshaw believed Solti to be "the great Wagner conductor of our time", and was determined to record the four operas of "<a href="Der%20Ring%20des%20Nibelungen">Der Ring des Nibelungen</a>" with Solti and the finest Wagner singers available. The cast Culshaw assembled for the cycle included <a href="Kirsten%20Flagstad">Kirsten Flagstad</a>, <a href="Hans%20Hotter">Hans Hotter</a>, <a href="Birgit%20Nilsson">Birgit Nilsson</a> and <a href="Wolfgang%20Windgassen">Wolfgang Windgassen</a>. Apart from "<a href="Arabella">Arabella</a>" in 1957, in which he substituted when <a href="Karl%20B%C3%B6hm">Karl Böhm</a> withdrew, Solti had made no complete recording of an opera until the sessions for "<a href="Das%20Rheingold">Das Rheingold</a>", the first of the "Ring" tetralogy, in September and October 1958. In their respective memoirs Culshaw and Solti told how <a href="Walter%20Legge">Walter Legge</a> of Decca's rival EMI predicted that "Das Rheingold" would be a commercial disaster ("'Very nice,' he said, 'Very interesting. But of course you won't "sell" any.'") The success of the recording took the record industry by surprise. It featured for weeks in the "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" charts, the sole classical album alongside best sellers by <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a> and <a href="Pat%20Boone">Pat Boone</a>, and brought Solti's name to international prominence. He appeared with leading orchestras in New York, Vienna and Los Angeles, and at Covent Garden he conducted "Der Rosenkavalier" and <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Britten</a>'s "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream%20%28opera%29">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>".

In 1960 Solti signed a three-year contract to be music director of the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Philharmonic">Los Angeles Philharmonic</a> from 1962. Even before he took the post the Philharmonic's autocratic president, <a href="Dorothy%20Buffum%20Chandler">Dorothy Chandler</a>, breached his contract by appointing a deputy music director without Solti's approval. Although he admired the chosen deputy, <a href="Zubin%20Mehta">Zubin Mehta</a>, Solti felt he could not have his authority undermined from the outset, and he withdrew from his appointment. He accepted an offer to become musical director of <a href="The%20Royal%20Opera">Covent Garden Opera Company</a>, London. When first sounded out about the post he had declined it. After 14 years of experience at Munich and Frankfurt he was uncertain that he wanted a third successive operatic post. Moreover, founded only 15 years earlier, the Covent Garden company was not yet the equal of the best opera houses in Europe. <a href="Bruno%20Walter">Bruno Walter</a> convinced Solti that it was his duty to take Covent Garden on.

The biographer <a href="Montague%20Haltrecht">Montague Haltrecht</a> suggests that Solti seized the breach of his Los Angeles contract as a convenient pretext to abandon the Philharmonic in favour of Covent Garden. However, in his memoirs Solti wrote that he wanted the Los Angeles position very much indeed. He originally considered holding both posts in tandem, but later acknowledged that he had had a lucky escape, as he could have done justice to neither post had he attempted to hold both simultaneously.

Solti took up the musical directorship of Covent Garden in August 1961. The press gave him a cautious welcome, but there was some concern that under him there might be a drift away from the company's original policy of opera in English. Solti, however, was an advocate of opera in the vernacular, and he promoted the development of British and <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> singers in the company, frequently casting them in his recordings and important productions in preference to overseas artists. He demonstrated his belief in vernacular opera with a triple bill in English of "<a href="L%27heure%20espagnole">L'heure espagnole</a>", "<a href="Erwartung">Erwartung</a>" and "<a href="Gianni%20Schicchi">Gianni Schicchi</a>". As the decade went on, however, more and more productions had to be sung in the original language to accommodate international stars.

Like his predecessor <a href="Rafael%20Kubel%C3%ADk">Rafael Kubelík</a>, and his successor <a href="Colin%20Davis">Colin Davis</a>, Solti found his early days as musical director marred by vituperative hostility from a small clique in the Covent Garden audience. Rotten vegetables were thrown at him, and his car was vandalised outside the theatre, with the words "Solti must go!" scratched on its paintwork. Some press reviews were strongly critical; Solti was so wounded by a review in "The Times" of his conducting of "The Marriage of Figaro" that he almost left Covent Garden in despair. The chief executive of the Opera House, <a href="David%20Webster%20%28opera%20manager%29">Sir David Webster</a>, persuaded him to stay with the company, and matters improved, helped by changes on which Solti insisted. The chorus and orchestra were strengthened, and in the interests of musical and dramatic excellence, Solti secured the introduction of the "<a href="stagione">stagione</a>" system of scheduling performances, rather than the traditional repertory system. By 1967 "The Times" commented that "Patrons of Covent Garden today automatically expect any new production, and indeed any revival, to be as strongly cast as anything at the Met in New York, and as carefully presented as anything in <a href="La%20Scala">Milan</a> or <a href="Vienna%20State%20Opera">Vienna</a>".

The company's repertory in the 1960s combined the standard operatic works with less familiar pieces. Among the most celebrated productions during Solti's time in charge was <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Schoenberg</a>'s "<a href="Moses%20und%20Aron">Moses and Aaron</a>" in the 1965–66 and 1966–67 seasons. In 1970, Solti led the company to Germany, where they gave "Don Carlos", "Falstaff" and "Victory", a new work by <a href="Richard%20Rodney%20Bennett">Richard Rodney Bennett</a>. The public in Munich and Berlin were, according to the "<a href="Frankfurter%20Allgemeine%20Zeitung">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</a>", "beside themselves with enthusiasm".

Solti's bald head and demanding rehearsal style earned him the nickname "The Screaming Skull". A music historian called him "the bustling, bruising Georg Solti – a man whose entire physical and mental attitude embodied the words 'I'm in charge'." Singers such as <a href="Peter%20Glossop">Peter Glossop</a> described him as a bully, and after working with Solti, <a href="Jon%20Vickers">Jon Vickers</a> refused to do so again. Nevertheless, under Solti, the company was recognised as having achieved parity with the greatest opera houses in the world. <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> conferred the title "the Royal Opera" on the company in 1968. By this point Solti was, in the words of his biographer Paul Robinson, "after Karajan, the most celebrated conductor at work". By the end of his decade as music director at Covent Garden Solti had conducted the company in 33 operas by 13 composers.

In 1964 Solti separated from his wife. He moved into the <a href="Savoy%20Hotel">Savoy Hotel</a>, where not long afterwards he met <a href="Valerie%20Pitts">Valerie Pitts</a>, a British television presenter, sent to interview him. She too was married, but after pursuing her for three years, Solti persuaded her to divorce her husband. Solti and Valerie Pitts married on 11 November 1967. They had two daughters.

In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, <a href="Fritz%20Reiner">Fritz Reiner</a>, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting <a href="Carlo%20Maria%20Giulini">Carlo Maria Giulini</a> to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.

One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as "the best provincial orchestra in the world." Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was $5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a <a href="ticker-tape%20parade">ticker-tape parade</a>.

The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: "some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us." Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, "Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse. He is very tense at rehearsals, which makes us concentrate, but relaxed during the performance, which is a great asset to the orchestra." Peck recalled Solti's constant efforts to improve his own technique and interpretations, at one point experimentally dispensing with a baton, drawing a "darker and deeper, much more relaxed" tone from the players.
As well as raising the orchestra's profile and helping it return to prosperity, Solti considerably expanded its repertoire. Under him the Chicago Symphony gave its first cycles of the symphonies of <a href="Anton%20Bruckner">Bruckner</a> and <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Mahler</a>. He introduced new works commissioned for the orchestra, such as <a href="Witold%20Lutos%C5%82awski">Lutosławski</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Lutos%C5%82awski%29">Third Symphony</a>, and <a href="Michael%20Tippett">Tippett</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Tippett%29">Fourth Symphony</a> which was dedicated to Solti. Another new work was Tippett's "Byzantium", an orchestral song-cycle, premiered by Solti and the orchestra with the <a href="soprano">soprano</a> Faye Robinson. Solti frequently programmed works by American composers, including <a href="Charles%20Ives">Charles Ives</a> and <a href="Elliott%20Carter">Elliott Carter</a>.

Solti's recordings with the Chicago Symphony included the complete symphonies of Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner and Mahler. Most of his operatic recordings were with other orchestras, but his recordings of "<a href="The%20Flying%20Dutchman%20%28opera%29">The Flying Dutchman</a>" (1976), "<a href="Fidelio">Fidelio</a>" (1979), "Moses und Aron" (1984) and his second recordings of "<a href="Die%20Meistersinger%20von%20N%C3%BCrnberg">Die Meistersinger</a>" (1995) and <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi</a>'s "<a href="Otello">Otello</a>" (1991) were made with the Chicago players.

After relinquishing the position of music director in 1991, Solti continued to conduct the orchestra, and was given the title of music director laureate. He conducted 999 concerts with the orchestra. His 1,000th concert was scheduled for October 1997, around the time of his 85th birthday, but Solti died that September.

In addition to his tenure in Chicago Solti was music director of the <a href="Orchestre%20de%20Paris">Orchestre de Paris</a> from 1972 to 1975. From 1979 until 1983 he was also principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra. He continued to expand his repertoire. With the London Philharmonic he performed many of <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Elgar</a>'s major works in concert and on record. Before performing Elgar's two symphonies, Solti studied the composer's own recordings made more than 40 years earlier, and was influenced by their brisk tempi and impetuous manner. A critic in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" wrote that Solti "conveys the authentic frisson of the great Elgarian moment more vividly than ever before on record." Late in his career he became enthusiastic about the music of <a href="Dmitri%20Shostakovich">Shostakovich</a>, whom he admitted he failed to appreciate fully during the composer's lifetime. He made commercial recordings of seven of Shostakovich's fifteen symphonies.

In 1983 Solti conducted for the only time at the <a href="Bayreuth%20Festival">Bayreuth Festival</a>. By this stage in his career he no longer liked abstract productions of Wagner, or modernistic reinterpretations, such as <a href="Patrice%20Ch%C3%A9reau">Patrice Chéreau</a>'s 1976 Bayreuth "Ring", which he found grew boring on repetition. Together with the director <a href="Peter%20Hall%20%28director%29">Sir Peter Hall</a> and the designer <a href="William%20Dudley%20%28designer%29">William Dudley</a>, he presented a "Ring" cycle that aimed to represent Wagner's intentions. The production was not well received by German critics, who expected radical reinterpretation of the operas. Solti's conducting was praised, but illnesses and last-minute replacements of leading performers affected the standard of singing. He was invited to return to Bayreuth for the following season, but was unwell and withdrew on medical advice before the 1984 festival began.

In 1991 Solti collaborated with the actor and composer <a href="Dudley%20Moore">Dudley Moore</a> to create an eight-part television series, "Orchestra!", which was designed to introduce audiences to the symphony orchestra. In 1994 he directed the "Solti Orchestral Project" at <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a>, a training workshop for young American musicians. The following year, to mark the 50th anniversary of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, he formed the World Orchestra for Peace, which consisted of 81 musicians from 40 nations. The orchestra has continued to perform after his death, under the conductorship of <a href="Valery%20Gergiev">Valery Gergiev</a>.

Solti regularly returned to Covent Garden as a guest conductor in the years after he relinquished the musical directorship, greeted with "an increasingly boisterous hero's welcome" ("Grove"). From 1972 to 1997 he conducted ten operas, some of them in several seasons. Five were operas he had not conducted at the Royal Opera House before: "<a href="Carmen">Carmen</a>", "<a href="Parsifal%20%28opera%29">Parsifal</a>", "<a href="Die%20Entf%C3%BChrung%20aus%20dem%20Serail">Die Entführung aus dem Serail</a>", "<a href="Simon%20Boccanegra%20%28opera%29">Simon Boccanegra</a>" and a celebrated production of "<a href="La%20traviata">La traviata</a>" (1994) which propelled <a href="Angela%20Gheorghiu">Angela Gheorghiu</a> to stardom. On 14 July 1997 he conducted the last operatic music to be heard in the old house before it closed for more than two years for rebuilding. The previous day he had conducted what proved to be his last symphony concert. The work was Mahler's <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Mahler%29">Fifth Symphony</a>; the orchestra was the Zurich Tonhalle, with whom he had made his first orchestral recording 50 years earlier.

Solti died suddenly, in his sleep, on 5 September 1997 while on holiday in <a href="Antibes">Antibes</a> in the south of France. He was 84. After a state ceremony in Budapest, his ashes were interred beside the remains of Bartók in <a href="Farkasr%C3%A9ti%20Cemetery">Farkasréti Cemetery</a>.

Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company. He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with <a href="RCA%20Victor">RCA Victor</a>, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.

Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the "Ring" recordings, observed, "Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do."

Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in <a href="Zurich">Zurich</a> for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, <a href="Victor%20Olof">Victor Olof</a> did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's <a href="Columbia%20Graphophone%20Company">Columbia Records</a>), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later <a href="James%20Walker%20%28conductor%29">James Walker</a>, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the <a href="Berlin%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Berlin Philharmonic</a>, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony</a> and <a href="Vienna%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Vienna Philharmonic</a> orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, <a href="Joan%20Sutherland">Joan Sutherland</a>, <a href="R%C3%A9gine%20Crespin">Régine Crespin</a>, <a href="Pl%C3%A1cido%20Domingo">Plácido Domingo</a>, <a href="Gottlob%20Frick">Gottlob Frick</a>, <a href="Carlo%20Bergonzi">Carlo Bergonzi</a>, <a href="Kiri%20Te%20Kanawa">Kiri Te Kanawa</a> and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20van%20Dam">José van Dam</a>. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, <a href="Andr%C3%A1s%20Schiff">András Schiff</a>, <a href="Julius%20Katchen">Julius Katchen</a>, <a href="Clifford%20Curzon">Clifford Curzon</a>, <a href="Vladimir%20Ashkenazy">Vladimir Ashkenazy</a> and <a href="Kyung-wha%20Chung">Kyung-wha Chung</a>.

Solti's most celebrated recording was <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>'s "Der Ring des Nibelungen" made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965. It has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, the first poll being among readers of "Gramophone" magazine in 1999, and the second of professional music critics in 2011, for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s "<a href="BBC%20Music%20Magazine">Music Magazine</a>".

Honours awarded to Solti included the British <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> (honorary), 1968, and an honorary knighthood (KBE), 1971, which became a substantive knighthood when he took British citizenship in 1972, after which he was known as Sir Georg Solti. He received honours from other countries, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Portugal and the US. He received honorary fellowships or degrees from the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Music">Royal College of Music</a> and <a href="DePaul%20University">DePaul</a>, <a href="Furman%20University">Furman</a>, <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Leeds">Leeds</a>, <a href="University%20of%20London">London</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Surrey">Surrey</a> and <a href="Yale%20University">Yale</a> universities.

In celebration of his 75th birthday in 1987, a bronze <a href="Bust%20of%20Sir%20Georg%20Solti">bust of Solti</a> by <a href="Elisabeth%20Frink">Dame Elisabeth Frink</a> was dedicated in <a href="Lincoln%20Park">Lincoln Park</a>, Chicago, outside the <a href="Lincoln%20Park%20Conservatory">Lincoln Park Conservatory</a>. It was first displayed temporarily at the Royal Opera House in London. The sculpture was moved to <a href="Grant%20Park%20%28Chicago%29">Grant Park</a> in 2006 in a new "Solti Garden", near Orchestra Hall in <a href="Symphony%20Center">Symphony Center</a>. In 1997, to commemorate the 85th anniversary of his birth, the City of Chicago renamed the block of East Adams Street adjacent to Symphony Center as "Sir Georg Solti Place" in his memory.

Record industry awards to Solti included the Grand Prix Mondial du Disque (14 times) and 31 <a href="Grammy%20Awards">Grammy Awards</a> (including a special Trustees' Grammy Award, shared with John Culshaw, for the recording of the "Ring" (1967) and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (1996)). He won more Grammys than any other recording artist, whether classical or popular. In September 2007, as a tribute on the 10th anniversary of his death, Decca published a recording of his final concert.

After Solti's death his widow and daughters set up the Solti Foundation to assist young musicians. Solti's memoirs, written with the assistance of <a href="Harvey%20Sachs">Harvey Sachs</a>, were published the month after his death. Solti's life was also documented in a 1997 film by Peter Maniura, "Sir Georg Solti: The Making of a Maestro." In 2007 Valerie Solti was appointed a Cultural Ambassador of Hungary, an honorary title granted by the Hungarian state.

In 2012 a series of events under the banner of "Solti @ 100" was announced, to mark the centenary of Solti's birth. Among the events were concerts in New York City and Chicago, and commemorative exhibitions in London, Chicago, Vienna and New York. In the same year Solti was voted into the inaugural "Gramophone" "Hall of Fame".

The <a href="Sir%20Georg%20Solti%20International%20Conductors%27%20Competition">Sir Georg Solti International Conductors' Competition</a>, which occurs every two years in <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, is named in his honour.

Orion (mythology)

In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, Orion (; <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a>: Ὠρίων or ; <a href="Latin">Latin</a>: "Orion") was a giant <a href="hunting">huntsman</a> whom <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> placed among the stars as the <a href="Orion%20%28constellation%29">constellation of Orion</a>.

Ancient sources tell several different stories about Orion; there are two major versions of his birth and several versions of his death. The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a>, his visit to <a href="Chios">Chios</a> where he met <a href="Merope%20%28Oenopion%29">Merope</a> and after he violated her, was blinded by her father, <a href="Oenopion">Oenopion</a>, the recovery of his sight at <a href="Lemnos">Lemnos</a>, his hunting with <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a> on <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became <a href="Scorpius">Scorpio</a>, and his elevation to the heavens. Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories, and it is impossible to tell whether omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.

In Greek literature he first appears as a great hunter in <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s epic the "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>", where <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> sees his shade in the <a href="underworld">underworld</a>. The bare bones of Orion's story are told by the <a href="Hellenistic%20civilization">Hellenistic</a> and Roman collectors of myths, but there is no extant literary version of his adventures comparable, for example, to that of <a href="Jason">Jason</a> in <a href="Apollonius%20of%20Rhodes">Apollonius of Rhodes</a>' "<a href="Argonautica">Argonautica</a>" or <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>' "<a href="Medea">Medea</a>"; the entry in <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>'s "<a href="Fasti%20%28poem%29">Fasti</a>" for May 11 is a poem on the birth of Orion, but that is one version of a single story. The surviving fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation about Greek prehistory and myth.

Orion served several roles in <a href="Ancient%20Greece">ancient Greek</a> culture. The story of the adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the one on which there is the most evidence (and even on that, not very much); he is also the personification of the constellation of the same name; he was venerated as a <a href="Greek%20hero%20cult">hero</a>, in the Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia; and there is one <a href="etiology">etiological</a> passage which says that Orion was responsible for the present shape of the <a href="Strait%20of%20Sicily">Strait of Sicily</a>.

Orion is mentioned in the oldest surviving works of Greek literature, which probably date back to the 7th or 8th century BC, but which are the products of an oral tradition with origins several centuries earlier. In <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>" Orion is described as a constellation, and the star <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a> is mentioned as his dog. In the "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>", Odysseus sees him hunting in the underworld with a bronze club, a great slayer of animals; he is also mentioned as a constellation, as the lover of the <a href="Eos">Goddess Dawn</a>, as slain by <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a>, and as the most handsome of the earthborn. In the "<a href="Works%20and%20Days">Works and Days</a>" of <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a>, Orion is also a constellation, one whose rising and setting with the sun is used to reckon the year.
The legend of Orion was first told in full in a lost work by Hesiod, probably the "<a href="Astronomia">Astronomia</a>" (simple references to ‘"Hesiod"’, below will refer to the lost text from "<a href="Astronomia">Astronomia</a>", unless otherwise stated). This version is known through the work of <a href="Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</a> on the constellations, who gives a fairly long summary of Hesiod's episode on Orion. According to this version, Orion was likely the son of the sea-god <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a> and Euryale, daughter of <a href="Minos">Minos</a>, King of Crete. Orion could walk on the waves because of his father; he walked to the island of <a href="Chios">Chios</a> where he got drunk and attacked <a href="Merope%20%28Oenopion%29">Merope</a>, daughter of <a href="Oenopion">Oenopion</a>, the ruler there. In vengeance, Oenopion blinded Orion and drove him away. Orion stumbled to <a href="Lemnos">Lemnos</a> where <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a> — the lame smith-god — had his forge. Hephaestus told his servant, <a href="Cedalion">Cedalion</a>, to guide Orion to the uttermost East where <a href="Helios">Helios</a>, the Sun, healed him; Orion carried Cedalion around on his shoulders. Orion returned to Chios to punish Oenopion, but the king hid away underground and escaped Orion's wrath. Orion's next journey took him to <a href="Crete">Crete</a> where he hunted with the goddess <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a> and her mother <a href="Leto">Leto</a>, and in the course of the hunt, threatened to kill every beast on Earth. Mother <a href="Gaia%20%28mythology%29">Earth</a> objected and sent a giant scorpion to kill Orion. The creature succeeded, and after his death, the goddesses asked <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> to place Orion among the constellations. Zeus consented and, as a memorial to the hero's death, added the <a href="Scorpius">Scorpion</a> to the heavens as well.

Although Orion has a few lines in both Homeric poems and in the "Works and Days", most of the stories about him are recorded in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings. No great poet standardized the legend. The ancient sources for Orion's legend are mostly notes in the margins of ancient poets (<a href="scholia">scholia</a>) or compilations by later scholars, the equivalent of modern reference works or encyclopedias; even the legend from Hesiod's "Astronomy" survives only in one such compilation. In several cases, including the summary of the "Astronomy", although the surviving work bears the name of a famous scholar, such as <a href="Apollodorus%20of%20Athens">Apollodorus of Athens</a>, <a href="Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</a>, or <a href="Gaius%20Julius%20Hyginus">Gaius Julius Hyginus</a>, what survives is either an ancient forgery or an abridgement of the original compilation by a later writer of dubious competence; editors of these texts suggest that they may have borne the names of great scholars because they were abridgments, or even pupil's notes, based on the works of the scholars.

The margin of the Empress <a href="Aelia%20Eudocia">Eudocia</a>'s copy of the Iliad has a note summarizing a Hellenistic poet who tells a different story of Orion's birth. Here the gods <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a>, <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>, and <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a> come to visit <a href="Hyrieus">Hyrieus</a> of <a href="Tanagra">Tanagra</a>, who roasts a whole bull for them. When they offer him a favor, he asks for the birth of sons. The gods take the bull's hide and <a href="urinate">urinate</a> into it and bury it in the earth, then tell him to dig it up ten months later. When he does, he finds Orion; this explains why Orion is earthborn.

A second full telling (even shorter than the summary of Hesiod) is in a Roman-era collection of myths; the account of Orion is based largely on the mythologist and poet <a href="Pherecydes%20of%20Leros">Pherecydes of Leros</a>. Here Orion is described as earthborn and enormous in stature. This version also mentions Poseidon and Euryale as his parents. It adds a first marriage to <a href="Side%20%28mythology%29">Side</a> before his marriage to Merope. All that is known about Side is that <a href="Hera">Hera</a> threw her into <a href="Hades">Hades</a> for rivalling her in beauty. It also gives a different version of Orion's death than the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>": <a href="Eos">Eos</a>, the Dawn, fell in love with Orion and took him to <a href="Delos">Delos</a> where Artemis killed him.

Another narrative on the constellations, three paragraphs long, is from a Latin writer whose brief notes have come down to us under the name of Hyginus. It begins with the oxhide story of Orion's birth, which this source ascribes to <a href="Callimachus">Callimachus</a> and Aristomachus, and sets the location at <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Thebes</a> or Chios. Hyginus has two versions. In one of them he omits Poseidon; a modern critic suggests this is the original version.

The same source tells two stories of the death of Orion. The first says that because of his "living joined in too great a friendship" with <a href="Oenopion">Oenopion</a>, he boasted to <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a> and <a href="Leto">Leto</a> that he could kill anything which came from Earth. Gaia (the personification of Earth in Greek mythology) objected and created the Scorpion. In the second story, Artemis and Orion were inseparable lovers. However, because Artemis was the goddess of the hunt, moon, and chastity; her twin brother Apollo sought to protect Artemis from losing her innocence and despised their union. In order to keep her chaste, Apollo devised a plan to do away with Orion once and for all. The opportunity arose when Orion went for a swim in a vastly large lake, and only the faint shape of his head was visible from the shore. Apollo and Artemis were standing along the lake, and Apollo took the opportunity to challenge Artemis’ skills as an archer. Apollo told Artemis that she was not a talented enough huntress to hit targets of great distances and claimed that she could not even hit the object in the lake. Greek Gods are known for their stubbornness and Artemis was no exception. Annoyed by her brother’s remarks, Artemis shot the Orion square in the head, immediately killing him. Apollo successfully tricked her into murdering her lover and once Artemis discovered what she had done she wallowed in despair. In her pain she appealed to Zeus to immortalize Orion in the stars so she could be with him. He connects Orion with several constellations, not just Scorpio. Orion chased <a href="Pleione%20%28mythology%29">Pleione</a>, the mother of the <a href="Pleiades%20%28mythology%29">Pleiades</a>, for seven years, until Zeus intervened and raised all of them to the stars. In "Works and Days", Orion chases the Pleiades themselves. <a href="Canis%20Minor">Canis Minor</a> and <a href="Canis%20Major">Canis Major</a> are his dogs, the one in front is called <a href="Procyon">Procyon</a>. They chase <a href="Lepus%20%28constellation%29">Lepus</a>, the hare, although Hyginus says some critics thought this too base a prey for the noble Orion and have him pursuing <a href="Taurus%20%28constellation%29">Taurus</a>, the bull, instead. A Renaissance mythographer adds other names for Orion's dogs: Leucomelaena, <a href="Maera%20%28hound%29">Maera</a>, Dromis, Cisseta, Lampuris, <a href="Lycoctonus">Lycoctonus</a>, Ptoophagus, Arctophonus.

There are numerous variants in other authors. Most of these are incidental references in poems and <a href="scholia">scholia</a>sts. The Roman poet <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a> shows Orion as a giant wading through the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> with the waves breaking against his shoulders; rather than, as the mythographers have it, walking on the water. There are several references to Hyrieus as the father of Orion that connect him to various places in <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a>, including <a href="Hyria%20%28Boeotia%29">Hyria</a>; this may well be the original story (although not the first attested), since Hyrieus is presumably the <a href="%3Awikt%3Aeponym">eponym</a> of Hyria. He is also called Oeneus, although he is not the <a href="Oeneus">Calydonian Oeneus</a>. Other ancient scholia say, as Hesiod does, that Orion was the son of Poseidon and his mother was a daughter of Minos; but they call the daughter Brylle or Hyeles. There are two versions where Artemis killed Orion, either with her arrows or by producing the Scorpion. In the second variant, Orion died of the Scorpion's sting as he does in Hesiod. Although Orion does not defeat the Scorpion in any version, several variants have it die from its wounds. Artemis is given various motives. One is that Orion boasted of his beast-killing and challenged her to a contest with the <a href="discus">discus</a>. Another is that he assaulted either Artemis herself or <a href="Nymphai%20Hyperboreioi">Opis</a>, a <a href="Hyperborean">Hyperborean</a> maiden in her band of huntresses. <a href="Aratus">Aratus</a>'s brief description, in his "Astronomy", conflates the elements of the myth: according to Aratus, Orion attacks Artemis while hunting on "Chios", and the Scorpion kills him there. <a href="Nicander">Nicander</a>, in his "Theriaca", has the scorpion of ordinary size and hiding under a small ("oligos") stone. Most versions of the story that continue after Orion's death tell of the gods raising Orion and the Scorpion to the stars, but even here a variant exists: Ancient poets differed greatly on whom <a href="Aesculapius">Aesculapius</a> brought back from the dead; the Argive epic poet <a href="Telesarchus">Telesarchus</a> is quoted as saying in a scholion that Aesculapius resurrected Orion. Other ancient authorities are quoted anonymously that Aesculapius healed Orion after he was blinded by Oenopion.

The story of Orion and Oenopion also varies. One source refers to Merope as Oenopion's wife, not his daughter. Another refers to Merope as the daughter of Minos and not of Oenopion. The longest version (a page in the Loeb) is from a collection of melodramatic plots drawn up by an Alexandrian poet for the Roman <a href="Cornelius%20Gallus">Cornelius Gallus</a> to make into Latin verse. It describes Orion as slaying the wild beasts of Chios and looting the other inhabitants to make a bride-price for Oenopion's daughter, who is called Aëro or Leiro. Oenopion does not want to marry her to someone like Orion, and eventually Orion, in frustration, breaks into her bedchamber and rapes her. The text implies that Oenopion blinds him on the spot.

Latin sources add that Oenopion was the son of Dionysus. Dionysus sent <a href="satyr">satyr</a>s to put Orion into a deep sleep so he could be blinded. One source tells the same story but converts Oenopion into <a href="Minos">Minos</a> of Crete. It adds that an oracle told Orion that his sight could be restored by walking eastward and that he found his way by hearing the <a href="Cyclops">Cyclops</a>' hammer, placing a Cyclops as a guide on his shoulder; it does not mention Cabeiri or Lemnos—this is presumably the story of Cedalion recast. Both Hephaestus and the Cyclopes were said to make thunderbolts; they are combined in other sources. One scholion, on a Latin poem, explains that Hephaestus gave Orion a horse.

<a href="Giovanni%20Boccaccio">Giovanni Boccaccio</a> cites a lost Latin writer for the story that Orion and Candiope were son and daughter of Oenopion, king of Sicily. While the virgin huntsman Orion was sleeping in a cave, Venus seduced him; as he left the cave, he saw his sister shining as she crossed in front of it. He ravished her; when his father heard of this, he banished Orion. Orion consulted an oracle, which told him that if he went east, he would regain the glory of kingship. Orion, Candiope, and their son Hippologus sailed to Thrace, "a province eastward from Sicily". There he conquered the inhabitants, and became known as the son of Neptune. His son begat the <a href="Dryas%20%28mythology%29">Dryas</a> mentioned in <a href="Statius">Statius</a>.

In Ancient Greece, Orion had a <a href="Greek%20hero%20cult">hero cult</a> in the region of <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a>. The number of places associated with his birth suggest that it was widespread. Hyria, the most frequently mentioned, was in the territory of <a href="Tanagra">Tanagra</a>. A feast of Orion was held at Tanagra as late as the Roman Empire. They had a tomb of Orion most likely at the foot of Mount <a href="Cerycius">Cerycius</a> (now Mount Tanagra). <a href="Maurice%20Bowra">Maurice Bowra</a> argues that Orion was a national hero of the Boeotians, much as <a href="Castor%20and%20Pollux">Castor and Pollux</a> were for the Dorians. He bases this claim on the Athenian epigram on the <a href="Battle%20of%20Coronea%20%28447%20BC%29">Battle of Coronea</a> in which a hero gave the Boeotian army an oracle, then fought on their side and defeated the Athenians.

The <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a>n school of epic poetry was chiefly concerned with the genealogies of the gods and heroes; later writers elaborated this web. Several other myths are attached to Orion in this way: A papyrus fragment of the Boeotian poet <a href="Corinna">Corinna</a> gives Orion fifty sons (a traditional number). This included the <a href="oracle">oracular</a> hero Acraephen, who, she sings, gave a response to <a href="Asopus">Asopus</a> regarding Asopus' daughters who were abducted by the gods. <a href="Corinna">Corinna</a> sang of Orion conquering and naming all the land of the dawn. Bowra argues that Orion was believed to have delivered oracles as well, probably at a different shrine. Hyginus says that <a href="Hylas">Hylas</a>'s mother was Menodice, daughter of Orion. Another mythographer, Liberalis, tells of <a href="Menippe%20and%20Metioche">Menippe and Metioche</a>, daughters of Orion, who sacrificed themselves for their country's good and were transformed into comets.
Orion also has <a href="etiology">etiological</a> connection to the city of <a href="Messina%2C%20Italy">Messina</a> in Sicily. <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus of Sicily</a> wrote a history of the world up to his own time (the beginning of the reign of <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a>). He starts with the gods and the heroes. At the end of this part of the work, he tells the story of Orion and two wonder-stories of his mighty earth-works in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>. One tells how he aided <a href="Zanclus">Zanclus</a>, the founder of Zancle (the former name for Messina), by building the promontory which forms the harbor. The other, which Diodorus ascribes to Hesiod, relates that there was once a broad sea between Sicily and the mainland. Orion built the whole Peloris, the <a href="Punta%20del%20Faro">Punta del Faro</a>, and the temple to Poseidon at the tip, after which he settled in <a href="Euboea">Euboea</a>. He was then "numbered among the stars of heaven and thus won for himself immortal remembrance". The Renaissance historian and mathematician <a href="Francesco%20Maurolico">Francesco Maurolico</a>, who came from Messina, identified the remains of a temple of Orion near the present Messina Cathedral. Maurolico also designed an ornate fountain, built by the sculptor <a href="Giovanni%20Angelo%20Montorsoli">Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli</a> in 1547, in which Orion is a central figure, symbolizing the <a href="Emperor%20Charles%20V">Emperor Charles V</a>, also a master of the sea and restorer of Messina; Orion is still a popular symbol of the city.

Images of Orion in classical art are difficult to recognize, and clear examples are rare. There are several ancient Greek images of club-carrying hunters that could represent Orion, but such generic examples could equally represent an archetypal "hunter", or indeed <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a>. Some claims have been made that other Greek art represents specific aspects of the Orion myth. A tradition of this type has been discerned in 5th century BC <a href="Pottery%20of%20ancient%20Greece">Greek pottery</a>—<a href="John%20Beazley">John Beazley</a> identified a scene of Apollo, <a href="Palm%20branch%20%28symbol%29">Delian palm</a> in hand, revenging Orion for the attempted rape of Artemis, while another scholar has identified a scene of Orion attacking Artemis as she is revenged by a snake (a counterpart to the scorpion) in a funerary group—supposedly symbolizing the hope that even the criminal Orion could be made immortal, as well as an astronomical scene in which <a href="Cephalus">Cephalus</a> is thought to stand in for Orion and his constellation, also reflecting this system of iconography. Also, a tomb frieze in <a href="Taranto">Taranto</a> (ca. 300 BC) may show Orion attacking Opis. But the earliest surviving clear depiction of Orion in classical art is Roman, from the depictions of the Underworld scenes of the Odyssey discovered at the <a href="Esquiline%20Hill">Esquiline Hill</a> (50–40 BC). Orion is also seen on a 4th-century bas-relief, currently affixed to a wall in the <a href="Porto%20%28Naples%29">Porto</a> neighborhood of Naples. The constellation Orion rises in November, the end of the sailing season, and was associated with stormy weather, and this characterization extended to the mythical Orion—the bas-relief may be associated with the sailors of the city.

Mythographers have discussed Orion at least since the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> of classical learning; the Renaissance interpretations were allegorical. In the 14th century, Boccaccio interpreted the oxhide story as representing human conception; the hide is the womb, Neptune the moisture of semen, Jupiter its heat, and Mercury the female coldness; he also explained Orion's death at the hands of the moon-goddess as the Moon producing winter storms. The 16th-century Italian mythographer <a href="Natalis%20Comes">Natalis Comes</a> interpreted the whole story of Orion as an <a href="allegory">allegory</a> of the evolution of a storm cloud: Begotten by air (Zeus), water (Poseidon), and the sun (Apollo), a storm cloud is diffused (Chios, which Comes derives from χέω, "pour out"), rises though the upper air (<a href="Air%20%28classical%20element%29">Aërope</a>, as Comes spells Merope), chills (is blinded), and is turned into rain by the moon (Artemis). He also explains how Orion walked on the sea: "Since the subtler part of the water which is rarefied rests on the surface, it is said that Orion learned from his father how to walk on water." Similarly, Orion's conception made him a symbol of the <a href="Filius%20philosophorum">philosophical child</a>, an allegory of philosophy springing from multiple sources, in the Renaissance as in alchemical works, with some variations. The 16th-century German alchemist <a href="Michael%20Maier">Michael Maier</a> lists the fathers as Apollo, Vulcan and Mercury, and the 18th-century French alchemist <a href="Antoine-Joseph%20Pernety">Antoine-Joseph Pernety</a> gave them as Jupiter, Neptune and Mercury.

Modern mythographers have seen the story of Orion as a way to access local <a href="Folklore">folk tales</a> and <a href="cult%20%28religious%20practice%29">cultic</a> practices directly without the interference of ancient high culture; several of them have explained Orion, each through his own interpretation of <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> prehistory and of how <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> represents it. There are some points of general agreement between them: for example, that the attack on Opis is an attack on Artemis, for Opis is one of the names of Artemis.

There was a movement in the late nineteenth century to interpret all the Boeotian heroes as merely personifications of the constellations; there has since come to be wide agreement that the myth of Orion existed before there was a constellation named for him. Homer, for example, mentions Orion, the Hunter, and Orion, the constellation, but never confuses the two. Once Orion was recognized as a constellation, astronomy in turn affected the myth. The story of Side may well be a piece of astronomical mythology. The Greek word "side" means <a href="pomegranate">pomegranate</a>, which bears fruit while Orion, the constellation, can be seen in the night sky. Rose suggests she is connected with Sidae in Boeotia, and that the pomegranate, as a sign of the Underworld, is connected with her descent there.

The 19th-century German classical scholar <a href="Erwin%20Rohde">Erwin Rohde</a> viewed Orion as an example of the Greeks erasing the line between the gods and mankind. That is, if Orion was in the heavens, other mortals could hope to be also.

The Hungarian mythographer <a href="Karl%20Ker%C3%A9nyi">Karl Kerényi</a>, one of the founders of the modern study of Greek mythology, wrote about Orion in "Gods of the Greeks" (1951). Kerényi portrays Orion as a giant of <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titanic</a> vigor and criminality, born outside his mother as were <a href="Tityos">Tityos</a> or <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>. Kerényi places great stress on the variant in which Merope is the wife of Oenopion. He sees this as the remnant of a lost form of the myth in which Merope was Orion's mother (converted by later generations to his stepmother and then to the present forms). Orion's blinding is therefore parallel to that of <a href="Aegypius%20%28mythology%29">Aegypius</a> and <a href="Oedipus">Oedipus</a>.

In "Dionysus" (1976), Kerényi portrays Orion as a shamanic hunting hero, surviving from Minoan times (hence his association with Crete). Kerényi derives Hyrieus (and Hyria) from the Cretan dialect word "ὕρον - hyron", meaning "beehive", which survives only in ancient dictionaries. From this association he turns Orion into a representative of the old <a href="mead">mead</a>-drinking cultures, overcome by the wine masters Oenopion and Oeneus. (The Greek for "wine" is "oinos".) Fontenrose cites a source stating that Oenopion taught the Chians how to make wine before anybody else knew how.

<a href="Joseph%20Fontenrose">Joseph Fontenrose</a> wrote "Orion : the Myth of the Hunter and the Huntress" (1981) to show Orion as the <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> of a variety of grotesque hero. Fontenrose views him as similar to <a href="C%C3%BAchulainn">Cúchulainn</a>, that is, stronger, larger, and more potent than ordinary men and the violent lover of the Divine Huntress; other heroes of the same type are <a href="Actaeon">Actaeon</a>, <a href="Leucippus%20%28mythology%29">Leucippus</a> (son of <a href="Oenomaus">Oenomaus</a>), <a href="Cephalus">Cephalus</a>, <a href="Teiresias">Teiresias</a>, and <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> as the lover of <a href="Callisto%20%28mythology%29">Callisto</a>. Fontenrose also sees Eastern parallels in the figures of <a href="Aqhat">Aqhat</a>, <a href="Attis">Attis</a>, <a href="Dumuzid%20the%20Shepherd">Dumuzi</a>, <a href="Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a>, <a href="Dushyanta">Dushyanta</a>, and <a href="Prajapati">Prajapati</a> (as pursuer of <a href="Ushas">Ushas</a>).

In "The Greek Myths" (1955), <a href="Robert%20Graves">Robert Graves</a> views Oenopion as his perennial <a href="Year-King">Year-King</a>, at the stage where the king pretends to die at the end of his term and appoints a substitute, in this case Orion, who actually dies in his place. His blindness is iconotropy from a picture of Odysseus blinding the <a href="Cyclops">Cyclops</a>, mixed with a purely Hellenic solar legend: the Sun-hero is captured and blinded by his enemies at dusk, but escapes and regains his sight at dawn, when all beasts flee him. Graves sees the rest of the myth as a syncretism of diverse stories. These include Gilgamesh and the Scorpion-Men, Set becoming a scorpion to kill Horus and the story of <a href="Aqhat">Aqhat</a> and Yatpan from <a href="Ras%20Shamra">Ras Shamra</a>, as well as a conjectural story of how the priestesses of Artemis Opis killed a visitor to their island of Ortygia. He compares Orion's birth from the bull's hide to a West African rainmaking charm and claims that the son of Poseidon should be a rainmaker.

The ancient Greek and Roman sources which tell more about Orion than his being a gigantic huntsman are mostly both dry and obscure, but poets do write of him: The brief passages in Aratus and Virgil are mentioned <a href="%23Variants">above</a>. <a href="Pindar">Pindar</a> celebrates the <a href="Pankration">pancratist</a> Melissus of Thebes "who was not granted the build of an Orion", but whose strength was still great.

<a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> translated Aratus in his youth; he made the Orion episode half again longer than it was in the Greek, adding the traditional Latin <a href="literary%20topos">topos</a> of madness to Aratus's text. Cicero's "Aratea" is one of the oldest Latin poems to come down to us as more than isolated lines; this episode may have established the technique of including <a href="Epic%20poetry">epyllia</a> in non-epic poems.

Orion is used by <a href="Horace">Horace</a>, who tells of his death at the hands of <a href="Diana%20%28mythology%29">Diana</a>/<a href="Artemis">Artemis</a>, and by <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>, in his <a href="Fasti%20%28poem%29">Fasti</a> for May 11, the middle day of the <a href="Feast%20of%20the%20Lemures">Lemuria</a>, when (in Ovid's time) the constellation Orion set with the sun. Ovid's episode tells the story of Hyrieus and two gods, Jupiter and Neptune, although Ovid is bashful about the climax; Ovid makes Hyrieus a poor man, which means the sacrifice of an entire ox is more generous. There is also a single mention of Orion in his "<a href="Ars%20Amatoria">Art of Love</a>", as a sufferer from unrequited love: "Pale Orion wandered in the forest for Side."

<a href="Statius">Statius</a> mentions Orion four times in his "Thebaïd"; twice as the constellation, a personification of storm, but twice as the ancestor of <a href="Dryas%20%28mythology%29">Dryas</a> of Tanagra, one of the defenders of Thebes. The very late Greek epic poet <a href="Nonnus">Nonnus</a> mentions the oxhide story in brief, while listing the Hyrians in his Catalogue of the Boeotian army of Dionysius.

References since antiquity are fairly rare. At the beginning of the 17th century, French sculptor <a href="Barth%C3%A9lemy%20Prieur">Barthélemy Prieur</a> cast a bronze statue "Orion et Cédalion", some time between 1600 and 1611. This featured Orion with <a href="Cedalion">Cedalion</a> on his shoulder, in a depiction of the ancient legend of Orion recovering his sight; the sculpture is now displayed at the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a>.

<a href="Nicolas%20Poussin">Nicolas Poussin</a> painted "Paysage avec Orion aveugle cherchant le soleil" (1658) ("Landscape with blind Orion seeking the sun"), after learning of the description by the 2nd-century Greek author <a href="Lucian">Lucian</a>, of a picture of Orion recovering his sight; Poussin included a storm-cloud, which both suggests the transient nature of Orion's blindness, soon to be removed like a cloud exposing the sun, and includes Natalis Comes' esoteric interpretation of Orion "as" a storm-cloud. Poussin need not have consulted Lucian directly; the passage is in the notes of the illustrated French translation of <a href="Philostratus%20of%20Lemnos">Philostratus</a>' "Imagines" which Poussin is known to have consulted. The Austrian <a href="Daniel%20Seiter">Daniel Seiter</a> (active in Turin, Italy), painted "Diane auprès du cadavre d'Orion" (c.1685) ("Diana next to Orion's corpse"), pictured <a href="Orion%20%28mythology%29%23Seiter%20painting">above</a>.

In <a href="Endymion%20%28poem%29">Endymion</a> (1818), <a href="John%20Keats">John Keats</a> includes the line ""Or blind Orion hungry for the morn"", thought to be inspired by Poussin. <a href="William%20Hazlitt">William Hazlitt</a> may have introduced Keats to the painting—he later wrote the essay "On Landscape of Nicholas Poussin", published in "<a href="Table-Talk%20%28Hazlitt%29">Table Talk, Essays on Men and Manners</a>" (1821-2). <a href="Richard%20Henry%20Horne">Richard Henry Horne</a>, writing in the generation after Keats and Hazlitt, penned the three volume epic poem "Orion" in 1843. It went into at least ten editions and was reprinted by the <a href="Scholartis%20Press">Scholartis Press</a> in 1928.

Science fiction author <a href="Ben%20Bova">Ben Bova</a> re-invented Orion as a time-traveling servant of various gods in a series of five novels. In <a href="The%20Blood%20of%20Olympus">The Blood of Olympus</a>, the final volume of a series, <a href="Rick%20Riordan">Rick Riordan</a> depicts Orion as one of the giant sons of the Earth Goddess <a href="Gaia%20%28mythology%29">Gaea</a>.

Italian composer <a href="Francesco%20Cavalli">Francesco Cavalli</a> wrote the opera, "L'Orione" in 1653. The story is set on the Greek island of <a href="Delos">Delos</a> and focuses on Diana's love for Orion as well as on her rival, Aurora. Diana shoots Orion only after being tricked by Apollo into thinking him a sea monster—she then laments his death and searches for Orion in the underworld until he is elevated to the heavens. <a href="Johann%20Christian%20Bach">Johann Christian Bach</a> ('the English Bach') wrote an opera, "Orion, or Diana Reveng'd", first presented at London's <a href="Haymarket%20Theatre">Haymarket Theatre</a> in 1763. Orion, sung by a <a href="castrato">castrato</a>, is in love with Candiope, the daughter of Oenopion, King of Arcadia but his arrogance has offended Diana. Diana's oracle forbids him to marry Candiope and foretells his glory and death. He bids a touching farewell to Candiope and marches off to his destiny. Diana allows him his victory and then kills him, offstage, with her arrow. In another aria, his mother Retrea (Queen of Thebes), laments his death but ultimately sees his elevation to the heavens. The 2002 opera "<a href="Galileo%20Galilei%20%28opera%29">Galileo Galilei</a>" by American composer <a href="Philip%20Glass">Philip Glass</a> includes an <a href="Story%20within%20a%20story">opera within an opera</a> piece between Orion and Merope. The sunlight, which heals Orion's blindness, is an allegory of modern science. Philip Glass has also written a shorter work on Orion, as have <a href="T%C5%8Dru%20Takemitsu">Tōru Takemitsu</a>, <a href="Kaija%20Saariaho">Kaija Saariaho</a>, and <a href="John%20Casken">John Casken</a>. <a href="David%20Bedford">David Bedford</a>'s late-twentieth-century works are about the constellation rather than the mythical figure; he is an amateur astronomer.

The twentieth-century French poet <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Char">René Char</a> found the blind, lustful huntsman, both pursuer and pursued, a central symbol, as James Lawler has explained at some length in his 1978 work "René Char: the Myth and the Poem." French novelist <a href="Claude%20Simon">Claude Simon</a> likewise found Orion an apt symbol, in this case of the writer, as he explained in his "Orion aveugle" of 1970. Marion Perret argues that Orion is a silent link in <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>'s "<a href="The%20Waste%20Land">The Waste Land</a>" (1922), connecting the lustful <a href="Actaeon">Actaeon</a>/Sweeney to the blind <a href="Teiresias">Teiresias</a> and, through Sirius, to the Dog "that's friend to men".

Michael Hordern

Sir Michael Murray Hordern, <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> (3 October 19112 May 1995) was an English stage and film actor whose career spanned nearly 60 years. He is best known for his <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespearean</a> roles, especially that of <a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>, which he played to much acclaim on stage in <a href="Stratford-upon-Avon">Stratford-upon-Avon</a> in 1969 and London in 1970. He then successfully assumed the role on television five years later. He often appeared in film, rising from a <a href="bit%20part">bit part</a> actor in the late 1930s to a member of the main cast; by the time of his death he had appeared in nearly 140 cinema roles. His later work was predominantly in television and radio.

Born in <a href="Berkhamsted%2C%20Hertfordshire">Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire</a> into a family with no theatrical connections, Hordern was educated at <a href="Windlesham%20House%20School">Windlesham House School</a> where he became interested in drama. He went on to <a href="Brighton%20College">Brighton College</a> where his interest in the theatre developed. After leaving the college he joined an <a href="amateur%20dramatics">amateur dramatics</a> company, and came to the notice of several influential Shakespearean directors who cast him in minor roles in "<a href="Othello">Othello</a>" and "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>". During the Second World War he served on <a href="HMS%20Illustrious%20%2887%29">HMS "Illustrious"</a> where he reached the rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20commander%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">lieutenant commander</a>. Upon his <a href="demobilisation">demobilisation</a> he resumed his acting career and made his television debut, becoming a reliable bit-part actor in many films, particularly in the <a href="war%20film">war film</a> genre.

Hordern came to prominence in the early 1950s when he took part in a theatrical competition at the <a href="Arts%20Theatre">Arts Theatre</a> in London. There, he impressed <a href="Glen%20Byam%20Shaw">Glen Byam Shaw</a> who secured the actor a season-long contract at the <a href="Royal%20Shakespeare%20Theatre">Shakespeare Memorial Theatre</a> where he played major parts, including <a href="Caliban">Caliban</a> in "<a href="The%20Tempest">The Tempest</a>", <a href="Jaques%20%28As%20You%20Like%20It%29">Jaques</a> in "<a href="As%20You%20Like%20It">As You Like It</a>", and Sir Politick Would-Be in <a href="Ben%20Jonson">Ben Jonson's</a> comedy "<a href="Volpone">Volpone</a>". The following season Hordern joined <a href="Michael%20Benthall">Michael Benthall's</a> company at <a href="the%20Old%20Vic">the Old Vic</a> where, among other parts, he played <a href="Polonius">Polonius</a> in "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>", and <a href="John%2C%20King%20of%20England">the title role</a> in "<a href="King%20John%20%28play%29">King John</a>". In 1958 he won a <a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">best actor</a> award at that year's <a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Awards">British Academy Television Awards</a> for his role as the barrister in <a href="John%20Mortimer">John Mortimer's</a> courtroom drama "<a href="The%20Dock%20Brief">The Dock Brief</a>". Along with his theatrical responsibilities Hordern had regular minor roles in various films including "<a href="Cleopatra%20%281963%20film%29">Cleopatra</a>" (1963), and "<a href="A%20Funny%20Thing%20Happened%20on%20the%20Way%20to%20the%20Forum%20%28film%29">A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</a>" (1966).

In the late 1960s Hordern met the British theatre director <a href="Jonathan%20Miller">Jonathan Miller</a>, who cast him in "<a href="Whistle%20and%20I%27ll%20Come%20to%20You">Whistle and I'll Come to You</a>", which was recorded for television and received wide praise. Hordern's next major play was "<a href="Jumpers">Jumpers</a>" which appeared at the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">Royal National Theatre</a> at the start of 1972. His performance was praised by critics and he reprised the role four years later. His television commitments increased towards the end of his life. His credits include "<a href="Paradise%20Postponed">Paradise Postponed</a>", the <a href="BAFTA">BAFTA</a> award-winning "<a href="Memento%20Mori%20%28novel%29">Memento Mori</a>", and the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> adaptation of "<a href="Middlemarch%20%281994%20TV%20serial%29">Middlemarch</a>". He was appointed a CBE in 1972 and was <a href="knight%20bachelor">knighted</a> eleven years later. Hordern suffered from kidney disease during the 1990s and died from it in 1995 at the age of 83.

Hordern's mother, Margaret Murray, was descended from <a href="James%20Murray%20%28physician%29">James Murray</a>, an Irish physician whose research into digestion led to his discovery of the stomach aid <a href="milk%20of%20magnesia">milk of magnesia</a> in 1829. The invention earned him a <a href="knight%20bachelor">knighthood</a> and brought the family great wealth. Margaret grew up in England, and attended <a href="St%20Audries%20Park">St Audries School for Girls</a> in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>.

Hordern's father, Edward, was the son of a Lancastrian priest who was the rector at the <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Church%2C%20Bury">Holy Trinity Church</a> in <a href="Bury%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bury</a>. As a young man Edward joined the <a href="Royal%20Indian%20Navy">Royal Indian Marines</a> and gained the rank of <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a>. During a short break on home-leave he fell in love with Margaret, after they were introduced by one of his brothers. The courtship was brief and the young couple married in <a href="Burma">Burma</a> on 28 November 1903. They had their first child, a son, Geoffrey, in 1905, followed by another, Peter, in 1907.

Four years after the birth of Peter, a pregnant Margaret returned to England where Michael Hordern, her third son, was born on 3 October 1911 in <a href="Berkhamsted">Berkhamsted</a>, <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>. Still stationed abroad, Edward was promoted to the rank of <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">captain</a> for which he received a good salary. The family lived in comfort and Margaret employed a <a href="scullery%20maid">scullery maid</a>, nanny, groundsman, and full-time cook.
Margaret left for India to visit her husband in 1916. The trip, although only planned as a short term stay, lasted two years because of the ferocity of the First World War. In her absence, Hordern was sent to <a href="Windlesham%20House%20School">Windlesham House School</a> in <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a> at the age of five. His young age exempted him from full-time studies but he was allowed to partake in extracurricular activities, including swimming, football, rugby and fishing. After a few years, and along with a fellow enthusiast, he set up the "A Acting Association" (AAA), a small theatrical committee, which organised productions on behalf of the school. As well as the organisation of plays, Hordern arranged a regular group of players, himself included, to perform various plays which they wrote, directed, and choreographed themselves. He stayed at Windlesham House for nine years, later describing his time there as "enormous fun".

Hordern was 14 when he left Windlesham House to continue his schooling as a member of Chichester House at <a href="Brighton%20College">Brighton College</a>. By the time he joined the college, his interest in acting had matured. In his 1993 autobiography, "A World Elsewhere", he admitted: "I didn't excel in any area apart from singing; I couldn't read music but I sang quite well." There he helped organise amateur performances of various <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> operas. The first of these was "<a href="The%20Gondoliers">The Gondoliers</a>", in which he played the role of the Duchess. The tutors called his performance a great success, and he was given a position within the men's chorus in the next piece, "<a href="Iolanthe">Iolanthe</a>". Over the next few years, he took part in "<a href="The%20Mikado">The Mikado</a>" as a member of the chorus, and then appeared as the Major-General in "<a href="The%20Pirates%20of%20Penzance">The Pirates of Penzance</a>". It was a period which he later acknowledged as being the start of his career. When the war ended in 1918, Edward, who was by now a port officer in <a href="Calcutta">Calcutta</a>, arranged for Margaret to return to England. With her, she brought home an orphaned baby girl named Jocelyn, whom she adopted. The following year, Edward retired from active service and returned to England where he relocated his family to <a href="Haywards%20Heath">Haywards Heath</a> in Sussex. There, Michael developed a love for fishing, a hobby about which he remained passionate for the rest of his life.

In his autobiography Hordern admitted that his family showed no interest in the theatre and that he had not seen his first professional play, "<a href="Ever%20Green">Ever Green</a>", until he was 19. It was at around this time that he met <a href="Christopher%20Hassall">Christopher Hassall</a>, a fellow student at Brighton College. Hassall, who also went on to have a successful stage career, was, as Hordern noted, instrumental in his decision to become an actor. In 1925 Hordern moved to <a href="Dartmoor">Dartmoor</a> with his family where they converted a disused barn into a farm house. For Hordern the move was ideal; his love of fishing had become stronger and he was able to explore the remote landscape and its isolated rivers.

Hordern left Brighton College in the early 1930s and secured a job as a teaching assistant in a <a href="Preparatory%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">prep school</a> in <a href="Beaconsfield">Beaconsfield</a>. He joined an <a href="Amateur%20theatre">amateur dramatics</a> company and in his spare time, rehearsed for the company's only play, "Ritzio's Boots", which was entered into a British Drama League competition, with Hordern in the title role. The play did well but conceded the prize, a professional production at a leading London theatre, to "Not This Man", a drama written by <a href="Sydney%20Box">Sydney Box</a>. So envious was he of the rival show's success that Hordern supplied a scathing review to "The Welwyn Times" calling Box's show a "blasphemous bunk and cheap theatrical claptrap". The comment infuriated Box, who issued the actor with a writ to attend court on a count of <a href="slander">slander</a>. Hordern won the case and left Box liable for the proceeding's expenses. Years later the two men met on a film set where Box, much to Hordern's surprise, thanked him for helping to kick-start his career in film making, as he had received a lot of publicity as a result of the court case.

With the death of his mother in January 1933, Hordern decided to pursue a professional acting career. He briefly took a job at a prep school but fell ill with <a href="poliomyelitis">poliomyelitis</a> and had to leave. Upon his recuperation, he was offered a job as a travelling salesman for the <a href="British%20Educational%20Suppliers%20Association">British Educational Suppliers Association</a>, a family-run business belonging to a former school friend at Windlesham House. As part of his job he spent some time in <a href="Stevenage">Stevenage</a> where he joined an amateur dramatics company and appeared in two plays; "<a href="Journey%27s%20End">Journey's End</a>", in which he played Raleigh, and "Diplomacy", a piece which the actor disliked as he considered it to be "too old-fashioned". Both productions provided him with the chance to work with a cue-script, something which he found to be helpful for the rest of his career. That summer he joined a Shakespearian theatre company which toured stately homes throughout the United Kingdom. His first performance was <a href="Orlando%20%28As%20You%20Like%20It%29">Orlando</a> in "<a href="As%20You%20Like%20It">As You Like It</a>", followed by "<a href="Love%27s%20Labour%27s%20Lost">Love's Labour's Lost</a>", in which he co-starred with Osmond Daltry. Hordern admired Daltry's acting ability and later admitted to him being a constant influence on his Shakespearean career.

In addition to his Shakespearean commitments, Hordern joined the St Pancras People's Theatre, a London-based company partly funded by the theatrical manager <a href="Lilian%20Baylis">Lilian Baylis</a>. Hordern enjoyed his time there, despite the tiresome commute between Sussex and London, and stayed with the company for five years. By the end of 1936 he had left his sales job in Beaconsfield to pursue a full-time acting career. He moved into a small flat at <a href="Marble%20Arch">Marble Arch</a> and became one of the many jobbing actors eager to make a name for themselves on the London stage.

Hordern's London debut came in January 1937, as an <a href="understudy">understudy</a> to <a href="Bernard%20Lee">Bernard Lee</a> in the play "Night Sky" at the <a href="Savoy%20Theatre">Savoy Theatre</a>. On nights when he was not required, Hordern would be called upon to undertake the duties of assistant stage manager, for which he was paid £2.10s a week. In March, Daltry, who had since formed his own company, Westminster Productions, cast Hordern as Ludovico in "<a href="Othello">Othello</a>".
The part became Hordern's first paid role as an actor for a theatre company. The play was an instant hit and ran at the People's Theatre in <a href="Mile%20End">Mile End</a> for two weeks. It also starred the English actor <a href="Stephen%20Murray%20%28actor%29">Stephen Murray</a> in the title role, but he became contractually obliged elsewhere towards the end of the run. This allowed Hordern to take his place for which Daltry paid Hordern an extra £1 a week.

After "Othello"'s closure, Daltry undertook a tour of Scandinavia and the Baltic with two plays, "<a href="Outward%20Bound%20%28play%29">Outward Bound</a>", and "<a href="Arms%20and%20the%20Man">Arms and the Man</a>". He employed Hordern in both with the first being the more successful. It was a time that the actor recognised as being a turning point in his professional acting career. On his return to London, and after spending a few weeks in unemployment, he was offered a part in the ill-fated "Ninety Sail". The play, about <a href="Christopher%20Wren">Sir Christopher Wren's</a> time in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, was cancelled on the day Hordern was due to start work, with "unforeseen problems" cited as the reason by its producers.

In mid-1937 the theatre proprietor Ronald Russell offered Hordern a part in his <a href="repertory">repertory company</a>, the Rapier Players, who were then based at <a href="Colston%20Hall">Colston Hall</a> in <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>. Hordern's first acting role within the company was as Uncle Harry in the play "<a href="Someone%20at%20the%20Door%20%28play%29">Someone at the Door</a>". Because of the play's success, Russell <a href="Typecasting%20%28acting%29">employed him in the same type of role</a>, the monotony of which frustrated the actor who longed to play the <a href="leading%20man">leading man</a>. It was whilst with the Rapier Players that Hordern fell in love with Eve Mortimer, a <a href="Minor%20%28law%29">juvenile</a> actress who appeared in minor roles in many of Russell's productions. Hordern considered his experience with the Rapier Players to be invaluable; it taught him how a professional theatre company worked under a strict time frame and how it operated with an even stricter budget. He was allowed two minutes to study each page of the script, but because of the frequent mistakes and many stalled lines, rehearsals became long and laborious. Hordern described the company's <a href="Theatrical%20property">props</a> as being made to a very high standard, despite being bought on a shoe-string budget.

After a brief holiday with Eve in Scotland in 1938, Hordern returned to London where he appeared in "Quinneys", a radio play broadcast by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> in June of that year. The main part went to <a href="Henry%20Ainley">Henry Ainley</a> whom Hordern described as "a great actor, who, sadly, was past his best".
Hordern then made a return to Bristol to prepare for the following season with the Rapier Players. One production singled out in the "<a href="Western%20Daily%20Press">Western Daily Press</a>" as particularly good was "Love in Idleness", in which Hordern played the lead character. A reporter for the paper thought that the play "had been noticed" among theatrical critics and that the players "filled their respective roles excellently".

By the end of 1938 Hordern's father had sold the family home and had bought a cottage in <a href="Holt%2C%20Wiltshire">Holt</a>, near <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath, Somerset</a>. The arrangement was convenient for the young actor, who used the premises as a base while he appeared in shows with the Rapier Players. One such piece was an adaption of <a href="Stella%20Gibbons">Stella Gibbons's</a> "<a href="Cold%20Comfort%20Farm">Cold Comfort Farm</a>", which starred <a href="Mabel%20Constanduros">Mabel Constanduros</a>, who had adapted the book with Gibbons' permission. Hordern was cast in the supporting role of Seth, a part he described as being fun to perform. The modernised script was "adored" by the cast, according to Hordern, but loathed by the audience who expected it to be exactly like the book.

Hordern and Eve left Bristol in 1939 for <a href="Harrogate">Harrogate</a>, where Eve joined a small repertory company called the White Rose Players. After a brief spell of unemployment, and with <a href="Second%20World%20War">the outbreak of war</a>, Hordern volunteered for a post within the <a href="Air%20Raid%20Precautions">Air Raid Precautions</a> (ARP). He was accepted but soon grew frustrated at not being able to conduct any rescues because of the lack of enemy action. He decided that it was "not a very good way to fight the war" and enlisted instead as a gunner with the Royal Navy. While he was waiting to be accepted he and Eve responded to an advertisement in "<a href="The%20Stage">The Stage</a>" for actors in a repertory company in Bath. They were appointed as the company's leading man and lady. Their first and only engagement was in a play entitled "Bats in the Belfry" which opened at the city's <a href="Bath%20Assembly%20Rooms">Assembly Rooms</a> on 16 October. Hordern's elation at finally becoming a leading man was short-lived when he received his call-up that December. In the interest of helping to boost public morale, Hordern sought permission from the navy to allow him to complete his theatrical commitment in Bath and to appear in his first film, a thriller called "<a href="Girl%20in%20the%20News">Girl in the News</a>", directed by <a href="Carol%20Reed">Carol Reed</a>; his request was accepted, and he was told to report for duty at Plymouth Barracks in the early months of 1940 when the show had finished and he was free from filming responsibilities.

In 1940, after a minor role in "Without the Prince" at the Whitehall Theatre, Hordern played the small, uncredited part of a BBC official alongside James Hayter in <a href="Arthur%20Askey">Arthur Askey's</a> comedy film "<a href="Band%20Waggon%20%28film%29">Band Waggon</a>". Soon after, he began his naval gunnery training on board "City of Florence", a <a href="defensively%20equipped%20merchant%20ship">defensively equipped merchant ship</a> (DEMS) which delivered ammunition to the city of <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> on behalf of the British fleet. He found that although his <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a> upbringing hindered his ability to make friends on board the ship, it helped in his appeal to his commanding officers.

By 1941 <a href="radar">radar</a> was slowly being introduced within the Navy and Hordern was appointed as one of the first operatives who communicated enemy movements to the <a href="RAF">RAF</a>. He later said that the post was owed to his clear diction and deep vocal range. His commentary impressed his superior officers so much that by early 1942 he had been given the job as a Fighter Direction Officer, and then <a href="first%20lieutenant">first lieutenant</a> on board <a href="HMS%20Illustrious%20%2887%29">HMS "Illustrious"</a>. Shortly after the departure of his immediate superior, he was promoted to <a href="lieutenant%20commander">lieutenant commander</a>, a rank which he held for two years. Alongside his naval responsibilities, he was also appointed as the ship's entertainment officer, and was responsible for organising shows featuring various members of "Illustrious"s crew as the show's cast.

During a short visit to Liverpool in 1943, Hordern proposed to Eve; they married on 27 April of that year with the actor <a href="Cyril%20Luckham">Cyril Luckham</a> as best man. After the honeymoon, Hordern resumed his duties on "Illustrious" while Eve returned to repertory theatre in <a href="Southport">Southport</a>. In the months after the end of the war in 1945, he was transferred to the Admiralty where he worked briefly as a ship dispatcher. The Horderns rented a flat in Elvaston Place in <a href="Kensington">Kensington</a>, London, and he began to seek work as an actor. After a short while, he was approached by <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Obey">André Obey</a> who cast him in his first television role, Noah, in a play adapted from the book of the same name. Hordern was apprehensive about performing in the new medium and found the rehearsal and live performance to be exhausting; but he was generously paid, earning £45 for the entire engagement.

Hordern's first role in 1946 came as Torvald Helmar in "<a href="A%20Doll%27s%20House">A Doll's House</a>" at the <a href="Intimate%20Theatre">Intimate Theatre</a> in <a href="Palmers%20Green">Palmers Green</a>. This was followed by the part of Richard Fenton, a murder victim, in "Dear Murderer" which premiered at the <a href="Aldwych%20Theatre">Aldwych Theatre</a> on 31 July. The play was a success and ran for 85 performances until its closure on 12 October. "Dear Murderer" thrilled the critics and Hordern was singled out by one reporter for the "<a href="Hull%20Daily%20Mail">Hull Daily Mail</a>" who thought that the actor brought "sincerity to a difficult role". The following month Eve gave birth to the couple's only child, a daughter, Joanna, who was born at <a href="Queen%20Charlotte%27s%20and%20Chelsea%20Hospital">Queen Charlotte's Hospital</a> in <a href="Chelsea%2C%20London">Chelsea</a>. That Christmas he took the role of <a href="Nick%20Bottom">Nick Bottom</a> in a festive reworking of <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Henry Purcell</a>'s "<a href="The%20Fairy-Queen">The Fairy-Queen</a>". The play was the first performance by the Covent Garden Opera Company, which later became known as <a href="The%20Royal%20Opera">The Royal Opera</a>.

Towards the end of April 1947, Hordern accepted the small part of Captain Hoyle in <a href="Richard%20Llewellyn">Richard Llewellyn's</a> comic drama film "Noose". Two other roles occurred that year: as Maxim de Winter in a television adaption of <a href="Daphne%20du%20Maurier">Daphne du Maurier's</a> novel "<a href="Rebecca%20%28novel%29">Rebecca</a>", followed by the part of a detective in "<a href="Good-Time%20Girl">Good-Time Girl</a>", alongside <a href="Dennis%20Price">Dennis Price</a> and <a href="Jean%20Kent">Jean Kent</a>. The following year he took part in three plays: <a href="Peter%20Ustinov">Peter Ustinov's</a> "The Indifferent Shepherd", which appeared at the newly opened <a href="Q%20Theatre">Q Theatre</a> in <a href="Brentford">Brentford</a>, West London; <a href="Henrik%20Ibsen">Ibsen's</a> "<a href="Ghosts%20%28play%29">Ghosts</a>"; and an adaptation of "<a href="The%20Wind%20in%20the%20Willows">The Wind in the Willows</a>" at the <a href="Royal%20Shakespeare%20Theatre">Shakespeare Memorial Theatre</a> in <a href="Stratford-upon-Avon">Stratford-upon-Avon</a> in which he portrayed the part of the blustery, eccentric <a href="Mr.%20Toad">Mr Toad</a>.

In early 1949 Hordern appeared as Pascal in the <a href="Michael%20Redgrave">Michael Redgrave</a>-directed comedy "A Woman in Love", but disliked the experience because of the hostile relationship between Redgrave and the show's star, <a href="Margaret%20Rawlings">Margaret Rawlings</a>. Next, he was engaged in the minor role of Bashford in the critically acclaimed <a href="Ealing%20Studios">Ealing comedy</a> "<a href="Passport%20to%20Pimlico">Passport to Pimlico</a>", a performance which he described as "tense and hyperactive".

By the 1950s Hordern had come to the notice of many influential directors. In his autobiography, the actor recognised the decade as being an important era of his career. It started with a major role in <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Anton Chekhov's</a> "<a href="Ivanov%20%28play%29">Ivanov</a>" in 1950. The production took place at the <a href="Cambridge%20Arts%20Theatre">Arts Theatre</a> in <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> and excited audiences because of its 25-year absence from the English stage. The writer <a href="T.%20C.%20Worsley">T. C. Worsley</a> was impressed by Hordern's performance and wrote: "Perhaps an actor with star quality might have imposed on us more successfully than Mr Michael Hordern, and won our sympathy for Ivanov by his own personality. But such a performance would have raised the level of expectation all round. As it is, Mr Hordern is rich in intelligence, sensitivity and grasp, and with very few exceptions, the company give his impressive playing the right kind of support." The title character in "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>", directed by <a href="Alec%20Clunes">Alec Clunes</a>, was Hordern's next engagement. Critics wrote of their dislike of Clunes's version, but the theatre reviewer <a href="Audrey%20Williamson%20%28theatre%20critic%29">Audrey Williamson</a> singled out Hordern's performance as being "deeply moving".

The dramatist <a href="John%20Whiting">John Whiting</a>, trying to make a name for himself in the theatre after the war, was called by Clunes to take part in a theatrical competition at the <a href="Arts%20Theatre">Arts Theatre</a> in London in 1951, for which he entered his play "Saints Day". Several other amateur directors also competed for the prize, which was to have their play funded and professionally displayed at the Arts. Having seen him perform the previous year, Whiting hired Hordern for the lead role of Paul Southman, a cantankerous old poet who fights off three rebellious army deserters who threaten the tranquillity of his sleepy country village. The play proved popular with audiences, but not so with theatrical commentators. Hordern liked the piece, calling it "bitter and interesting", but the press, who extensively reported on the competition throughout each stage, thought differently and condemned it for winning. This infuriated the actors <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a> and <a href="John%20Gielgud">John Gielgud</a>, who wrote letters of complaint to the press.

Hordern cited "Saint's Day"s negative publicity as having done his career "the power of good" as it brought him to the attention of the director <a href="Glen%20Byam%20Shaw">Glen Byam Shaw</a>, who cast him in a series of plays at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in 1951. Among the roles were <a href="Caliban">Caliban</a> in "<a href="The%20Tempest">The Tempest</a>", <a href="Jaques%20%28As%20You%20Like%20It%29">Jaques</a> in "As You Like It", and Sir Politick Would-Be in <a href="Ben%20Jonson">Ben Jonson's</a> comedy "<a href="Volpone">Volpone</a>". Hordern claimed to know very little about the bard's works and sought advice from friends about how best to prepare for the roles. The same year, he travelled down to <a href="Walton%20Studios">Nettlefold Studios</a>, <a href="Walton-on-Thames">Walton-on-Thames</a>, to film "<a href="Scrooge%20%281951%20film%29">Scrooge</a>", an adaptation of <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>'s "<a href="A%20Christmas%20Carol">A Christmas Carol</a>", in which he played <a href="Jacob%20Marley">Marley's ghost</a>. Reviews were mixed with "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" giving it a favourable write-up, while "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine remained ambivalent. The "Aberdeen Evening Express" echoed the comments made by an American reviewer by calling "Scrooge" a "trenchant and inspiring Christmas show". The author Fred Guida, writing in his book "Christmas Carol and Its Adaptations: A Critical Examination" in 2000, thought that Marley's ghost, though a "small but pivotal role", was "brilliantly played" by Hordern.

With the first play of the season imminent, the Horderns moved to Stratford and took temporary accommodation at Goldicote House, a large country property situated on the <a href="River%20Avon%2C%20Warwickshire">River Avon</a>. The first of his two plays, "The Tempest", caused Hordern to doubt his own acting ability when he compared his interpretation of Caliban to that of <a href="Alec%20Guinness">Alec Guinness</a>, who had played the same role four years earlier. Reassured by Byam Shaw, Hordern remained in the role for the entire run. A few days later, the actor was thrilled to receive a letter of appreciation from Michael Redgrave, who thought Hordern's Caliban was "immensely fine, with all the pity and pathos ... but with real terror and humour as well". More praise was received as the season continued; an anonymous theatre reviewer, quoted in Hordern's autobiography, called the actor's portrayal of Menenius Aggripa "a dryly acute study of the 'humorous patrician' and one moreover that can move our compassion in the Volscian cameo", before going on to say "we had felt that it would be long before Alec Guinness's Menenius could be matched. The fact that Michael Hordern's different reading can now stand beside the other does credit to a player who will be a Stratford prize."

Hordern's contract at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre lasted until mid-1952, and on its expiration, he secured a position within <a href="Michael%20Benthall">Michael Benthall's</a> theatrical company at <a href="the%20Old%20Vic">the Old Vic</a> in London. The company's first play, "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>", starred <a href="Richard%20Burton">Richard Burton</a>, <a href="Claire%20Bloom">Claire Bloom</a>, and <a href="Fay%20Compton">Fay Compton</a>, and opened on 14 September 1953. Hordern called it "the perfect play with which to open the season" as it featured "fine strong parts for everyone and [was] a good showpiece for an actor's latent vanity". Shortly after opening, it was transferred to <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, where it took part at the <a href="Edinburgh%20Festival%20Fringe">Fringe</a> before returning to London. For his role of <a href="Polonius">Polonius</a>, Hordern received mixed reviews, with one critic saying: "He was at his best in his early scenes with Ophelia ...but towards the end of the performance he began to obscure less matter with more art". After Edinburgh, Benthall took "Hamlet" on a provincial tour and the play had a successful run of 101 performances.

In mid-1953 the Danish government invited Benthall and his company to Helsingør (Elsinore) to perform "Hamlet" for the <a href="Norwegian%20Royal%20Family">Norwegian Royal Family</a>. The play was well received by the royals. On the whole, the actor enjoyed his time in "Hamlet" but behind the scenes, relations between him and Burton were strained. Hordern noted his colleague's "likeability, charm and charisma" but thought that Burton had a tendency to get easily "ratty" with him in social situations. Hordern described their working relationship as "love-hate" and admitted that they were envious of each other's success; Burton of Hordern because of the latter's good reviews, and Hordern of Burton who received more attention from fans. When Burton left for Hollywood years later, he recommended Hordern to various casting directors; Hordern was subsequently engaged in six of Burton's films.

"<a href="King%20John%20%28play%29">King John</a>" was next for Benthall's company and opened on 26 October 1953. The lead character initially went to an unknown and inexperienced young actor, but the part was re-cast with Hordern in the role. Hordern described "King John" as being "a difficult play in the sense that it has no common purpose or apparent theme". Simultaneously to this, he was commuting back to <a href="Pinewood%20Studios">Pinewood Studios</a> where he was filming "<a href="Forbidden%20Cargo%20%281954%20film%29">Forbidden Cargo</a>". The hectic schedule brought on a bout of exhaustion for which he received medical advice to reduce his workload.

In early 1955 Hordern was asked by the British theatre <a href="Theatre%20producer">manager and producer</a> <a href="Binkie%20Beaumont">Binkie Beaumont</a> to take the lead in <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Roussin">André Roussin</a>'s comedy "Nina", directed by <a href="Rex%20Harrison">Rex Harrison</a>. The play, which starred <a href="Edith%20Evans">Edith Evans</a>, <a href="Lockwood%20West">Lockwood West</a>, and <a href="James%20Hayter%20%28actor%29">James Hayter</a>, transferred from <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a> to the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Brighton">Theatre Royal</a> in <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a>. Beaumont's request came at short notice because Hordern's predecessor had proved inadequate. The play was cursed with bad luck: Evans fell ill and was replaced midway by an understudy who neglected to learn her lines; Harrison frequently upset the cast, which resulted in reduced morale. When Evans did return, she walked off stage and left after seeing empty seats in the front row.

Hordern regretted his decision to take part in Roussin's "Nina", but admitted that the allure of appearing alongside Evans had got the better of him. Harrison held auditions to replace his leading lady and settled on the Australian-American actress <a href="Coral%20Browne">Coral Browne</a>. Hordern and Browne grew close, aided by their mutual dislike of their disciplinarian director. They fell in love and they had an affair which lasted for the duration of the run. Years later Hordern confessed: "I kept falling in love. It is a common complaint among actors. You cannot be at such close quarters, mind and body, without being sorely tempted."

Hordern and Harrison's dislike for one another was evident to the rest of the cast. One night, after a performance of "Nina" in <a href="Eastbourne">Eastbourne</a>, and having felt that he had "acted [his] socks off", Hordern, along with the rest of the cast, were berated by Harrison who accused them of producing a piece "not fit for the end of a pier". "Nina" transferred to the Haymarket Theatre, London, not long after the incident but it was unsuccessful and closed after five weeks. "The play was fine", opined Hordern, "it was a disaster because of Rex Harrison." Hordern and Browne's relationship ended shortly after the play closed and Hordern set about rebuilding his marriage with Eve, who had long known of the affair.

Hordern viewed the 1950s as a good decade to appear in film, although he did not then particularly care for the medium. Writing in 1993 he said: "With cinema one has to leap into battle fully armed. From the start of the film the character has to be pinned down like a butterfly on a board. One does not always get this right, of course, sometimes starting at the beginning of shooting a film on a comedic level that cannot be sustained." He disliked his physical appearance, which he found to be "repulsive", and as a result loathed watching back his performances. He preferred radio because the audience only heard his voice, which he then considered his best attribute. Another reason was his recognition of the differences between his sense of personal achievement within a theatre compared to that on a film set: "You get a certain sort of satisfaction in delivering what the director wants of you, but the chances of being emotionally involved are slim." He acknowledged his good ability at learning lines, something which he found to be especially helpful for learning film scripts which frequently changed. He enjoyed the challenge of earning as much value as possible out of a scene and revelled in being able to hit "the right mark for the camera". With the experience of "Nina" still fresh in his mind, Hordern took a break from the stage and decided to concentrate on his film career.

Hordern was appearing in three to four films a year by 1953, a count that increased as the decade progressed. In 1956 he took a leading part in "<a href="The%20Spanish%20Gardener%20%28film%29">The Spanish Gardener</a>" for which he spent many months filming in southern Spain alongside <a href="Dirk%20Bogarde">Dirk Bogarde</a>, <a href="Cyril%20Cusack">Cyril Cusack</a>, and Bernard Lee. "The New York Times" called Hordern's role of the strict and pompous Harrington Brande "an unsympathetic assignment", but thought the actor did "quite well" in his portrayal. By the mid-1950s Hordern's name was becoming one of reliability and good value; as a result, he was offered a clutch of roles. In 1956 he appeared as <a href="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a> in "<a href="Alexander%20the%20Great%20%281956%20film%29">Alexander the Great</a>", and Commander Lindsay in "<a href="The%20Night%20My%20Number%20Came%20Up">The Night My Number Came Up</a>". He appeared in two other films the following year; the medical drama "<a href="No%20Time%20for%20Tears%20%28film%29">No Time for Tears</a>", and the thriller "<a href="Windom%27s%20Way">Windom's Way</a>". The Second World War was a popular genre for filmmakers during the 1950s. Hordern said the conflict took up a large part of people's lives; "whether it be one of love, loss, nostalgia or tragedy", everybody, according to the actor, had a story to tell and could relate to the situations that were being depicted before them on screen. He found his earlier naval experience to be an asset when cast in many war films, including "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Never%20Was">The Man Who Never Was</a>", "<a href="Pacific%20Destiny">Pacific Destiny</a>", "<a href="The%20Baby%20and%20the%20Battleship">The Baby and the Battleship</a>", all in 1956, and "<a href="I%20Was%20Monty%27s%20Double%20%28film%29">I Was Monty's Double</a>" two years later.
Hordern was cast in <a href="John%20Mortimer">John Mortimer's</a> 1957 play "The Dock Brief" in which Hordern played the <a href="barrister">barrister</a>. The story centres on a failed lawyer who is hired at the last minute to defend a man on a charge of murder. Hordern played the barrister opposite <a href="David%20Kossoff">David Kossoff's</a> murder suspect. After some positive comments from the theatrical press, the play transferred to television in May the same year and earned Hordern a <a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Best Actor Award</a> at the 1958 <a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Awards">British Academy Television Awards</a>. The Horderns moved to <a href="Donnington%2C%20Berkshire">Donnington, Berkshire</a> in 1958 where they renovated three cottages into one; the property became the family home and is where Hordern and Eve remained until their deaths.

The year 1959 was professionally disastrous for Hordern. He made a return to stage at the Old Vic in <a href="Arthur%20Wing%20Pinero">Arthur Wing Pinero's</a> "<a href="The%20Magistrate%20%28play%29">The Magistrate</a>" in which he played Mr. Posket. The play was not particularly successful and received mixed reviews: According to the author and theatre critic J. P. Wearing, Hordern was miscast, while a reporter for "The Stage", thought he gave a "convincing portrayal". Wearing believed that overall the play was not "played briskly enough", while a critic for "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" thought that it had "durable theatrical quality". The role was followed with a part of Pastor Manders in "Ghosts" opposite <a href="Flora%20Robson">Flora Robson</a>. "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" published an unenthusiastic notice, and thought Hordern's character had "an anxious air" about him. He received equally critical notices when he took to the stage to play <a href="Macbeth%20%28character%29">the title character</a> in "Macbeth", opposite <a href="Beatrix%20Lehmann">Beatrix Lehmann</a>. The press wrote of Hordern's "unintended comic interpretation" when characterising the evil king: "Half his time on stage he cringed like an American carpet seller in an ankle-length black dressing gown of fuzzy candlewick" thought one reviewer, who went on to say "he would make a sinister Shylock, a frightening Fagin. But this Thane of Cawdor would be unnerved by Banquo's valet, never mind Banquo's ghost."

On 9 October 1959, Hordern made his debut on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> at the <a href="Cort%20Theatre">Cort Theatre</a> in <a href="Marcel%20Aym%C3%A9">Marcel Aymé's</a> comedy "Moonbirds", alongside the comedian <a href="Wally%20Cox">Wally Cox</a>. The play was a disaster and closed after only two nights and three performances. Little was offered in the way of praise, although critics singled out Hordern's performance in particular as being good. He was unsure why the play failed, and attributed it to clashes of personality between cast and management.

In 1960 Hordern played <a href="John%20Tovey%2C%201st%20Baron%20Tovey">Admiral Sir John Tovey</a> in the British war film "<a href="Sink%20the%20Bismarck%21">Sink the Bismarck!</a>", based on the book "<a href="Last%20Nine%20Days%20of%20the%20Bismarck">Last Nine Days of the Bismarck</a>" by <a href="C.%20S.%20Forester">C. S. Forester</a> and with a plot reminiscent of his naval days. With a few smaller roles in between, Hordern started work on the American <a href="Epic%20film">epic</a> historical drama film "<a href="Cleopatra%20%281963%20film%29">Cleopatra</a>". It was made in 1962 and according to the actor, was "the most extraordinary piece of film-making in which I had the pleasure to take part". He played the Roman orator <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> and was hired on an eight-week contract which due to various setbacks, including cast sickness and adverse weather conditions, was extended to nine months. Much to Hordern's annoyance, the film would require him to once again work with Rex Harrison, who was cast as <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Caesar</a>. Despite the animosity between them, they agreed to endure each other's company for the sake of the film. The agreement was short-lived; Harrison made a drunken quip at a cast dinner about "Nina" which prompted Hordern to assault him. The incident almost resulted in Hordern's dismissal, but the matter was quickly resolved by producers and the two were kept separate in between filming. In 1993 Hordern claimed the incident had "cleared the air" between them and they eventually became friends. After "Cleopatra"'s release, Hordern made a return to films, appearing in "<a href="The%20Spy%20Who%20Came%20in%20from%20the%20Cold%20%28film%29">The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</a>" (1965), "<a href="How%20I%20Won%20the%20War">How I Won the War</a>" (1967), and "<a href="Where%20Eagles%20Dare">Where Eagles Dare</a>" in 1968. He also featured in the Roman <a href="farce">farce</a> "<a href="A%20Funny%20Thing%20Happened%20on%20the%20Way%20to%20the%20Forum%20%28film%29">A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</a>" in 1966.

Hordern first met the British theatre director <a href="Jonathan%20Miller">Jonathan Miller</a> in 1968. Miller, who had long been an admirer of Hordern, offered him the part of the agonistic Professor Parkin in his forthcoming television drama "<a href="Whistle%20and%20I%27ll%20Come%20to%20You">Whistle and I'll Come to You</a>". Hordern, who had heard positive things of Miller from theatrical friends, likewise thought highly of the director, and was quick to take up location filming in <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a> that year. He came to like Miller's way of working, such as having the freedom to improvise instead of adhering to the strict rules of a script; the actor wrote in his autobiography that he had never experienced that degree of professional freedom. The programme was released towards the end of 1968 and was a hit with audiences and critics. Mark Duguid of the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> called it "a masterpiece of economical horror that remains every bit as chilling as the day it was first broadcast", while a journalist for "The Telegraph", writing in 2010 about that year's remake starring <a href="John%20Hurt">John Hurt</a>, reminded readers of the "brilliant Sixties production by Jonathan Miller [in which] Michael Hordern made a fine, crusty Parkin". The year ended with a role in <a href="Peter%20Hall%20%28director%29">Peter Hall's</a> production of <a href="Edward%20Albee">Edward Albee's</a> "<a href="A%20Delicate%20Balance%20%28play%29">A Delicate Balance</a>" at the Aldwych Theatre. The piece received lukewarm reviews, with Hilary Spurling of "The Spectator" thinking Hordern was "ill-served" as the principal character, Tobias.

Miller and Hordern's collaboration continued into 1969 with "<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>" at the <a href="Nottingham%20Playhouse">Nottingham Playhouse</a>. Hordern immediately accepted the title role but later said that it was a character he never much cared to play. Writing about Miller in his autobiography, Hordern stated: "It was one of the most exhilarating and funny experiences I have had in the theatre." Miller recruited <a href="Frank%20Middlemass">Frank Middlemass</a> to play the <a href="Shakespearean%20fool">fool</a>, but contrary to tradition, Miller made the character an intimate of Lear's as opposed to a servant, something which Shakespearean purists found difficult to accept. Miller decided to further defy convention by concentrating on the relationships between the characters rather than adding detail to scenery and costume; he was eager not to use lavish sets and lighting for the fear of detracting from the characterisations and the sentimentality of the storyline. As such, the sets were bleak and the costumes more so; it was a style that was also used when the play was televised by the BBC later that decade.

When "King Lear" played at the Old Vic in 1970, reviews were mixed; J.W. Lambert thought that the "grey sets" and Hordern's "grizzled" costume were how Shakespeare would have intended them to be, while Eric Shorter thought otherwise, stating "I still do not understand those costumes." Of the performance, the dramatist and critic <a href="Martin%20Esslin">Martin Esslin</a> called Hordern's portrayal "a magnificent creation" before going on to say: "Hordern's timing of the silences from which snatches of demented wisdom emerge is masterly and illuminates the subterranean processes of his derangement." Writing for "The Times" later that year, the theatre critic <a href="Irving%20Wardle">Irving Wardle</a> described Hordern's Lear as a "sharp, peremptory pedant; more a law-giver than a soldier, and (as justice is an old man's profession) still in the prime of his life". Hordern played Lear once more that decade, in 1975, which was televised by the BBC for their series "<a href="Play%20of%20the%20Month">Play of the Month</a>".

The playwright <a href="Tom%20Stoppard">Tom Stoppard</a> approached Hordern in 1971 with a view to him playing a leading part in the playwright's new play "<a href="Jumpers">Jumpers</a>", a comic <a href="satire">satire</a> based around the field of academic <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a>. Hordern was to play George Moore, a bumbling old philosophy professor, who is employed at a modern university and who, throughout the play, is in constant debate with himself over his moral values. Hordern, though thinking the play was brilliant, disliked the script on the initial read-through as he did not understand its complex situations and strange dialogue. His co-star would be <a href="Diana%20Rigg">Diana Rigg</a>, who played Moore's wife Dotty, and the entire piece was to be directed by <a href="Peter%20Wood%20%28director%29">Peter Wood</a>.

"Jumpers" was scheduled to appear at the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">National Theatre</a> at the start of 1972, but encountered problems when the theatre's director, Laurence Olivier, called the play "unintelligible" before walking out during the first read-through in disgust. Despite this, rehearsals went ahead, which the cast found difficult; the play featured many scenes, a complicated script, and relied heavily on the opening scene, a sceptical speech about the existence of God which lasted 13 minutes. In his autobiography, Hordern commented: "Each day my fists would sink into my cardigan pockets as I tried to make sense of it all." In a meeting shortly before the opening night, Olivier complained to Stoppard that the play was overlong and, in some parts, laborious. Stoppard agreed to reduce the epilogue by half. The decision angered Hordern as it meant the extra stress of learning a new script at short notice. He vented his frustrations on Wood who agreed to leave his character alone and instead to cut many of the other scenes. The final dress rehearsal also experienced disruption when the <a href="revolving%20stage">revolving stage</a> broke down and had to be fixed half-way through. The problems had ceased by the opening performance the following evening; it was a night which Hordern called "unbelievable, one of the highlights of my career". The actress <a href="Maureen%20Lipman">Maureen Lipman</a>, who was in the audience on the opening night, said that her husband, the playwright <a href="Jack%20Rosenthal">Jack Rosenthal</a>, had "laughed so hard he thought he was going to be seriously ill".

The critic <a href="Michael%20Billington%20%28critic%29">Michael Billington</a>, writing in "The Guardian", gave a mixed review: "Once or twice one of Stoppard's brightly coloured balls falls to the ground, partly because Michael Hordern's moral philosopher substitutes academic mannerism for apprehension of the argument. But this is not to deny that Hordern's simian habit of scratching his left earlobe with right hand or leaning over his desk as if he is doing intellectual press-ups is very funny to watch or that he is brilliant at displaying cuckolded curiosity." Harold Hobson, the drama critic, thought that failing to enjoy the play was "not actually a criminal offence but it is a sad evidence of illiteracy". "Jumpers" won the "Evening Standard" 's Best Play Award which, much to Hordern's amusement, was presented by the philosopher <a href="A.%20J.%20Ayer">A. J. Ayer</a>.

In June 1973 Hordern appeared on radio for the BBC as <a href="Jeeves">Jeeves</a> in an adaption of <a href="P.%20G.%20Wodehouse">P.G. Wodehouse's</a> <a href="P.%20G.%20Wodehouse%20short%20stories%20bibliography%23Jeeves">"Jeeves" stories</a>, alongside <a href="Richard%20Briers">Richard Briers</a> as <a href="Bertie%20Wooster">Bertie Wooster</a>. The following year, Hordern narrated several other, one-off programmes for the broadcaster, including "The Honest Broker", "The Last Tsar", and "Tell the King the Sky Is Falling". In 1975 Hordern played the judge in <a href="Howard%20Barker">Howard Barker's</a> play "Stripwell" at the <a href="Royal%20Court%20Theatre">Royal Court Theatre</a>. Hordern described the character as "a man wracked by guilt, full of self-doubt and pessimism". It was a role which the actor found to be too close to his own personality for comfort. His time in the play was marred by personal problems; he and Eve had briefly separated and the actor was forced to rent a small flat in <a href="Sloane%20Square">Sloane Square</a> from the actor <a href="Michael%20Wilding%20%28actor%29">Michael Wilding</a> after being banished from the family home. Hordern and Eve soon reconciled, but it was a time which he was keen to forget, including the play. Critics were complimentary of his performance, with one writing: ""Stripwell"'s ambiguities are therefore viewed half affectionately and half contemptuously and this comes over well in Michael Hordern's portrayal of bumbling, sometimes endearing ineffectiveness, as skilful and accomplished a performance as one would expect from this actor."

Later, in 1975, Hordern narrated "<a href="Barry%20Lyndon">Barry Lyndon</a>", <a href="Stanley%20Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick's</a> filmed adaptation of <a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackeray">William Makepeace Thackeray</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Luck%20of%20Barry%20Lyndon">The Luck of Barry Lyndon</a>". The critic John Riley, writing for the British Film Institute, thought that the actor provided "a witty and ironic foil to the characters' helplessness". The same year Hordern was asked to narrate 30 episodes of the children's animation series "<a href="Paddington%20%281975%20TV%20series%29">Paddington</a>", which was based on the <a href="Paddington%20Bear">Paddington Bear</a> book series by <a href="Michael%20Bond">Michael Bond</a>. In his 1993 autobiography, Hordern wrote of his enjoyment at working on "Paddington" and that he could not differentiate between his enjoyment in comedy and drama: "it's a bit like difference between roast beef and meringue, both delicious in their way, but there is nothing more satisfying than a thousand people sharing their laughter with you".

In 1976 Hordern joined the <a href="Royal%20Shakespeare%20Company">RSC</a> in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he appeared as Prospero for <a href="Trevor%20Nunn">Trevor Nunn</a> in "The Tempest", an engagement which the actor found to be unpleasant because of his poor relationship with the show's director, <a href="Clifford%20Williams%20%28actor%29">Clifford Williams</a>. After that came a short run of "Love's Labour's Lost" in which he played Don Adriano de Armado opposite <a href="Alan%20Rickman">Alan Rickman</a> and <a href="Zo%C3%AB%20Wanamaker">Zoë Wanamaker</a>. Hordern was the oldest member of the company and found it difficult to adjust to the behaviour and attitudes of some of the younger and less experienced actors. He found it different from the 1950s: non-intimate, characterless, and lacking in morale because management preferred discipline rather than offering guidance and assistance to their young actors. Writing in his 1993 biography, Hordern wrote: "Being at Stratford again after all these years was rather like being on a battleship or an aircraft carrier that doesn't often come into harbour. You are at sea for long periods and away from the rest of your service and if the captain of your ship is a good one then the ship is happy; if not, then the commission you serve is very unhappy because you are a long way from land. At Stratford that season I was a long way from land." Later, in 1976, Hordern portrayed the kingly father of the Prince (played by <a href="Richard%20Chamberlain">Richard Chamberlain</a>) in the musical film adaptation of "<a href="Cinderella">Cinderella</a>", "<a href="The%20Slipper%20and%20the%20Rose">The Slipper and the Rose</a>", and returned to the role of George in Stoppard's "Jumpers" at the Lyttelton Theatre. The theatre critic Kenneth Hurren "enjoyed it immoderately" and thought the revival revealed a "tidier play than it look[ed]". Hordern compared it to the 1972 version by saying: "It is unquestionably a busy little number, and my first impression of the piece, back in 1972, was that it had more decoration than substance, and that the decoration was more chaotic than coherent."

In 1981 Hordern played the role of <a href="Gandalf">Gandalf</a> in the <a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%20%281981%20radio%20series%29">BBC radio adaptation</a> of <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">Tolkien's</a> "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>". The BBC's budget was generous, and attracted well-known actors from stage and television. The series ran for 26 episodes and was a hit with audiences and critics. The author Ernest Mathijs singled out Hordern in particular as being one of the more powerful characters of the series and his personal favourite, while co-star <a href="Ian%20Holm">Ian Holm</a>, writing years later in his autobiography "Acting My Life", said he thought Hordern interpreted the role "in a grand, rather old fashioned way". Writing in his autobiography in 1993, Hordern said he found the part of Gandalf to be "a bit of a slog".

Hordern and Jonathan Miller reprised their collaboration in 1982 with a final performance of "King Lear", again televised by the BBC. The actor considered this version to be his best and attributed its success to the fact he was getting older and therefore able to better understand the character. The author <a href="Joseph%20Pearce">Joseph Pearce</a>, writing in 2008, claimed that Hordern played the king "straight up with no gloss" and made a "reliable and workmanlike Lear" who is "forceful when he should be forceful, compassionate when he should be compassionate, [and] sorrowful when he should be sorrowful". Despite the praise, Pearce thought that Hordern's performance in Act 3 "lack[ed] the required fierceness and miss[ed] the mythic quality when compared to some of the bigger names".

In January 1983 Hordern was knighted, an honour which the actor called "a great thrill and [a] surprise to us all". That year he became popular among children as the voice of Badger in the <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> film "<a href="The%20Wind%20in%20the%20Willows%20%281983%20film%29">The Wind in the Willows</a>". He then spent the rest of 1983 appearing as Sir Anthony Absolute in "<a href="The%20Rivals">The Rivals</a>" for Peter Wood at the Royal National Theatre and received excellent notices. He was nominated for an award at that year's <a href="Olivier%20Awards">Olivier Awards</a> for best comedy performance of the year, but lost out to <a href="Griff%20Rhys%20Jones">Griff Rhys Jones</a>. His success on the stage was tinged with private turmoil; Eve was taken ill after she suffered a <a href="brain%20haemorrhage">brain haemorrhage</a>, a condition from which she never fully recuperated. She required constant care but recovered enough to become partially self-sufficient. However, in 1986 she had a fatal <a href="Myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a> at the couple's London flat. Hordern was devastated and became consumed in self-pity, in part because of his guilt at the extramarital affairs he had had with many of his leading ladies during the marriage.

In 1986, John Mortimer, a writer whom Hordern respected greatly, engaged the actor in "<a href="Paradise%20Postponed">Paradise Postponed</a>", an eleven-part drama which took a year to make and cost in excess of £6 million. Set in rural England, the saga depicts the struggles within British middle-class society during the post-war years. In his biography, Hordern described himself as "a man of prejudice rather than principle" and as such, had very little in common with his character, the left-wing, <a href="Marxist">Marxist</a>-loving vicar, Simeon Simcox. Despite the political differences, Hordern felt great empathy towards his character, and admired his "plain, straightforward attitude to life, his dottiness, and the way he hung to his faith in a wicked world with a saintliness verging on the simple".

Hordern made a return to the London stage in 1987 after a four-year absence. The play in which he starred, "<a href="You%20Never%20Can%20Tell%20%28play%29">You Never Can Tell</a>", transferred to the <a href="Haymarket%20Theatre">Haymarket Theatre</a> that December having made its debut at the <a href="Theatr%20Clwyd">Theatr Clwyd</a> in Wales earlier that year. It was the second time the actor had appeared in the play, the first being back in Bristol fifty years previously when he starred as the youthful lead, Valentine. This time he was cast as William, the elderly waiter, a part which he considered to be "a real hell to play", partly because of the many meals he had to serve up on stage, whilst at the same time trying to remember the complex script. He enjoyed the play immensely and was thrilled at its successful run. His engagement also gave him a chance to reunite with some old friends, including <a href="Irene%20Worth">Irene Worth</a>, <a href="Michael%20Denison">Michael Denison</a> and Frank Middlemass, all of whom were in the cast. Hordern admitted that, on the whole, the experience made him feel "a little happier" about life.

By the early 1990s Hordern was concentrating more on television. His roles were mostly those of ageing teachers, bank managers, politicians and clergymen. In 1989 he appeared alongside <a href="John%20Mills">John Mills</a> in an adaptation of <a href="Kingsley%20Amis">Kingsley Amis's</a> "Ending Up", a tale about a group of pensioners growing old together in a residential home. After that he took the part of Godfrey Colston in "Memento Mori", a television film about a group of elderly friends succumbing to old age, which was adapted for television from the <a href="Muriel%20Spark">Muriel Spark</a> <a href="Memento%20Mori%20%28novel%29">novel of the same name</a>. The film received excellent notices and Hordern's performance was described as outstanding by the critic Neil Sinyard. All that was required of Hordern in his next role, the wealthy but terminally ill landowner Peter Featherstone in the BBC adaptation "<a href="Middlemarch%20%281994%20TV%20serial%29">Middlemarch</a>", was for him simply to lie in bed and pretend to die. It was the kind of role which he found to be most fitting for someone of his advanced years and confirmed to him that the older he got, the more typecast he became. It was a situation that did not altogether bother him as he felt grateful for being employable at the age of 81.

In January 1995 Hordern was invited back to his old college in Brighton, where a room was named in his honour. Inside, the college had commissioned the sculptor <a href="Peter%20Webster%20%28artist%29">Peter Webster</a> to create a bronze bust of the actor which is displayed with a plaque. Hordern's last physical acting role came shortly afterwards as Lord Langland in the comedy film "A Very Open Prison". This was followed by two narration performances, firstly in "Spode A History of Excellence", and then in the five-part film "Dinosaurs and Their Living Relatives".

Hordern died of <a href="kidney%20disease">kidney disease</a> at the <a href="Churchill%20Hospital">Churchill Hospital</a>, Oxford, on 2 May 1995, at the age of 83. Medical staff confirmed that he had been suffering from "a long illness and had been receiving dialysis treatment".

Hordern was a self-confessed "lazy bugger" when it came to role preparation. He did not regret his lack of formal acting training, and attributed his abilities to watching and learning from other actors and directors. He said: "I am bored of the intellectual view of the theatre. Actually, it scares the shit out of me, my view being that an actor should learn the lines without too much cerebral interference." In 1951, he asked Byam Shaw how best to rehearse unfamiliar roles. The director advised him to "never read up on them" before going on to say "read the plays as much as [you like] but never read the commentators or critics". It was advice which Hordern adopted for the role of King Lear, and for the rest of his career. The critic Brian McFarlane, writing for the British Film Institute, said that Hordern, despite his relaxed attitude, "had one of the most productive careers of any 20th century British actor".

Throughout his 1993 autobiography "A World Elsewhere", Hordern exhibited his pride on being able to play a wide range of parts, something which made him a frequent subject among theatrical critics. The author Martin Banham thought that many of Hordern's characters shared a general identity of "an absent-minded, good-hearted English eccentric". The American journalist Mel Gussow, writing in Hordern's obituary in "The New York Times" in 1995, described the actor as being "a classical actor with the soul of a clown", while the actors <a href="John%20Hurt">John Hurt</a> and <a href="Michael%20Bryant%20%28actor%29">Michael Bryant</a> described Hordern as being "the <a href="Austin%20Princess">Austin Princess</a> among British actors", which implied to the author Sheridan Morley that Hordern possessed an element of "reliability but [with] a faint lack of charisma". Morley, who wrote Hordern's biography for the "<a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>", went on to describe the actor as being "one of the great eccentrics of his profession, perched perilously somewhere half way between Alistair Sim and Alec Guinness".

...And Justice for All (album)

...And Justice for All is the fourth studio album by American <a href="Heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> band <a href="Metallica">Metallica</a>, released on August 25, 1988, through <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a>. It is the first Metallica studio album to feature bassist <a href="Jason%20Newsted">Jason Newsted</a> after the death of <a href="Cliff%20Burton">Cliff Burton</a> in 1986.

"…And Justice for All" was recorded in early 1988 at <a href="Extasy%20Records%23Extasy%20Recording%20Studios">One on One Recording Studios</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. It features long and complex songs, fast tempos, and few verse-chorus structures. It is infamous for its sterile production, which producer <a href="Flemming%20Rasmussen">Flemming Rasmussen</a> attributed to his absence during the mixing process. The lyrics feature themes of political and legal injustice seen through the prisms of censorship, war, and nuclear brinkmanship. The cover, designed by Stephen Gorman based on a concept by Metallica guitarist <a href="James%20Hetfield">James Hetfield</a> and drummer <a href="Lars%20Ulrich">Lars Ulrich</a>, depicts <a href="Lady%20Justice">Lady Justice</a> bound in ropes. The album title is derived from the American <a href="Pledge%20of%20Allegiance%20%28United%20States%29">Pledge of Allegiance</a>. Three songs from the album were released as singles: "<a href="Harvester%20of%20Sorrow">Harvester of Sorrow</a>", "<a href="Eye%20of%20the%20Beholder%20%28song%29">Eye of the Beholder</a>", and "<a href="One%20%28Metallica%20song%29">One</a>"; the title track was released as a promotional single.

"…And Justice for All" was acclaimed by <a href="music%20journalism">music critics</a>. It was included in "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>"s annual <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a> critics' poll of the year's best albums, and the single "One", which also marked the band's first music video, earned Metallica its first <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> (and the first ever in the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Metal%20Performance">Best Metal Performance</a> category) in 1990. The group's best-selling album at the time, it is the first <a href="Underground%20music">underground</a> metal album to achieve chart success in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, peaking at number six on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. The album was certified <a href="RIAA%20certification">8× platinum</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) in 2003 for shipping eight million copies in the U.S., making it Metallica's second-best-selling album in the country. A remastering of the album was released on November 2, 2018 and reached number 37 and 42 on "Billboard"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s <a href="Top%20Album%20Sales">Top Album Sales</a> and <a href="Top%20Rock%20Albums">Top Rock Albums</a> charts respectively.

"…And Justice for All" is Metallica's first full-length studio album to feature bassist <a href="Jason%20Newsted">Jason Newsted</a> after the death of <a href="Cliff%20Burton">Cliff Burton</a> in 1986. Newsted had previously played on Metallica's "", an <a href="extended%20play">extended play</a> released in 1987. The band had intended to record the album earlier, but was sidetracked by the large number of festival dates scheduled for the summer of 1987, including the European leg of the <a href="Monsters%20of%20Rock">Monsters of Rock</a> festival. Another reason was frontman <a href="James%20Hetfield">James Hetfield</a>'s arm injury in a skateboarding accident. The band's previous studio album, "<a href="Master%20of%20Puppets">Master of Puppets</a>", marked the end of Metallica's contract with the <a href="Music%20for%20Nations">Music for Nations</a> label. Manager <a href="Peter%20Mensch">Peter Mensch</a> wanted the band to sign with British record distributor <a href="Phonogram%20Records">Phonogram Records</a>, and Phonogram chairman Martin Hooker was keen to obtain the band's contract. To persuade Metallica to choose his label Hooker offered them a bigger deal, "worth well over £1 million, which at that time was the biggest deal we'd ever offered anyone". His explanation was that the final figure for combined British and European sales of all three Metallica albums was more than 1.5 million copies. The album title was revealed in April 1988: "…And Justice for All", after the final words of the Pledge of Allegiance. The artwork was created by Stephen Gorman, based on a concept developed by Hetfield and drummer <a href="Lars%20Ulrich">Lars Ulrich</a>. It depicts a cracked statue of a blindfolded <a href="Lady%20Justice">Lady Justice</a>, bound by ropes with her breasts exposed and her scales overflowing with dollar bills. The title appears <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a>-style in the lower right corner.

"…And Justice for All" was recorded from January to May 1988 at <a href="Extasy%20Records%23Extasy%20Recording%20Studios">One on One Recording Studios</a> in Los Angeles. Metallica produced the album with <a href="Flemming%20Rasmussen">Flemming Rasmussen</a>. He had been initially unavailable for the planned start on January 1, 1988, and the band brought in <a href="Mike%20Clink">Mike Clink</a>, who had caught their attention for producing the debut album of <a href="Guns%20N%27%20Roses">Guns N' Roses</a>, "<a href="Appetite%20for%20Destruction">Appetite for Destruction</a>" (1987). Plans deteriorated, and three weeks later Rasmussen became available after Ulrich called him. Rasmussen listened to Clink's rough mixes for the album on his February 14 flight to Los Angeles, and upon his arrival, Clink was fired. Hetfield explained that recording with Clink did not work out so well, and Rasmussen came over as a last-minute replacement. However, Clink is credited with engineering the drums on two of the album's tracks: "The Shortest Straw" and "Harvester of Sorrow". While waiting for Rasmussen to arrive, the band recorded two cover songs—"Breadfan" and "The Prince"—to "fine‑tune the sound while they got into the studio vibe". Both were released as B-sides of the "<a href="Harvester%20of%20Sorrow">Harvester of Sorrow</a>" CD single, as separate B-sides for "<a href="Eye%20of%20the%20Beholder%20%28song%29">Eye of the Beholder</a>" and "<a href="One%20%28Metallica%20song%29">One</a>" respectively, and were included on the cover album "<a href="Garage%20Inc.">Garage Inc.</a>" (1998).

Rasmussen's first task was to adjust and arrange the guitar sound with which the band was dissatisfied. A guide track for the tempos and a <a href="click%20track">click track</a> for Ulrich's drumming were used. The band played in a live room, recording the instruments separately. Each song used three reels: one for drums, a second for bass and guitars and a third for anything else. Hetfield wrote lyrics during the recording sessions; these were occasionally unfinished as recording began, and Rasmussen said that Hetfield "wasn't really interested in singing" but instead "wanted that hard vibe". Metallica's recording process was new to Jason Newsted, who questioned his impact on the overall sound and the lack of discussion with the rest of the team. He recorded his parts separately from the rest of the band, with only the assistant engineer present. Newsted had had a different experience with his previous band, <a href="Flotsam%20and%20Jetsam%20%28band%29">Flotsam and Jetsam</a>, whose style he described as "basically everybody playing the same thing like a sonic wall".

The bass guitar was made almost inaudible at the instruction of Hetfield and Ulrich. According to Rasmussen: "After Lars and James heard their initial mixes the first thing they said was, 'Take the bass down so you can just hear it, and then once you've done that take it down a further 3dBs.' I have no idea why they wanted that, but it was totally out of my hands, and I didn't even know about it until the album had been released." In 2009, Hetfield said that the bass was obscured as the basslines often doubled his rhythm guitar part, making it indiscernible, and because the low frequencies were competing in the mix with his "scooped", bassy guitar sound. A lack of direction is also partly to blame; since the album was largely produced by the band, there was no one present in the studio to guide the band's new bassist and tell him what was expected of him, something a producer would typically do. Newsted was not satisfied with the final mixes: "The "Justice" album wasn't something that really felt good for me, because you really can't hear the bass."

Steve Thompson, who mixed the album, claims that Ulrich was squarely to blame for the inaudible bass and unusual drums. Thompson wanted to be relieved of his mixing duties when Ulrich presented his ideas on the production, but Thompson was not allowed to leave and received the majority of the criticism for the misrepresentation of bass of the record.

"…And Justice for All" is a musically progressive album featuring long and complex songs, fast <a href="tempo">tempo</a>s and few <a href="verse%E2%80%93chorus%20form">verse-chorus</a> structures. Metallica decided to broaden its sonic range, writing songs with multiple sections, heavy guitar <a href="arpeggio">arpeggio</a>s and unusual <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a>s. Hetfield later explained: "Songwriting-wise, [the album] was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do. 'We've jammed six riffs into one song? Let's make it eight. Let's go crazy with it.'" Music critic <a href="Simon%20Reynolds">Simon Reynolds</a> noted the riff changes and experimentation with <a href="timing%20%28music%29">timing</a> on the album's epically constructed songs: "The tempo shifts, gear changes, lapses, decelerations and abrupt halts". <a href="BBC%20Music">BBC Music</a>'s Eamonn Stack wrote that "…And Justice for All" sounds different from the band's previous albums, with longer songs, sparser arrangements, and harsher vocals by Hetfield. According to journalist <a href="Martin%20Popoff">Martin Popoff</a>, the album is less melodic than its predecessors because of its frequent tempo changes, unusual song structures and layered guitars. He argued that the album is more of a <a href="progressive%20metal">progressive metal</a> record because of its intricately performed music and bleak sound. Music writer <a href="Joel%20McIver">Joel McIver</a> called the album's music aggressive enough for Metallica to maintain its place with bands "at the mellower end of <a href="extreme%20metal">extreme metal</a>". According to writer <a href="Christopher%20Knowles%20%28comics%29">Christopher Knowles</a>, Metallica took "the thrash concept to its logical conclusion" on the album.

The album was noted for its "dry, sterile" production. Rasmussen said that was not his intention, as he tried for an ambient sound similar to the previous two albums. He was not present during the album's mixing, for which Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero had been hired beforehand. Rasmussen felt that, in his absence from the mixing process, Thompson and Barbiero ended up using only the <a href="close-mic%20placement">close microphones</a> on the mix and none of the room microphones, thus causing the "clicking", thin drum sound. The bass guitar is nearly inaudible, while the guitars sound "strangled mechanistic". He saw the "synthetic" percussion as another reason for the album's compressed sound.

The lyrical content of "…And Justice for All" is conceptually unified around notions of political and legal injustice as seen through the prism of war, censored speech, and nuclear brinksmanship. The majority of the songs raise issues that differ from the violent retaliation of the previous releases. Tom King wrote that for the first time the lyrics dealt with political and environmental issues. He named contemporaries <a href="Nuclear%20Assault">Nuclear Assault</a> as the only other band who applied ecological lyrics to thrash metal songs rather than singing about <a href="Satan">Satan</a> and <a href="Egyptian%20plagues">Egyptian plagues</a>. McIver noted that Hetfield, the band's main lyricist, wrote about topics that he had not addressed before, such as his revolt against <a href="the%20establishment">the establishment</a>. Ulrich described the songwriting process as their "<a href="CNN">CNN</a> years", with him and Hetfield watching the channel in search for song subjects—"I'd read about the blacklisting thing, we'd get a title, 'The Shortest Straw,' and a song would come out of that."

Concerns about the environmental plight of the planet ("Blackened"), corruption ("…And Justice for All"), and blacklisting and discrimination ("The Shortest Straw") are emphasized with traditional <a href="existential">existential</a> themes. Issues such as freedom of speech and civil liberties are presented from a grim and pessimistic point of view. "One" was unofficially nicknamed an "antiwar anthem" because of the lyrics which portray the suffering of a wounded soldier. "Dyers Eve" is a lyrical rant from Hetfield to his parents. Burton received co-writing credit on "To Live Is to Die" as the bass line is a medley of unused recordings Burton had performed prior to his death. Because the original recordings are not used on the track, the composition is credited as written by Burton and played by Newsted. The <a href="spoken%20word">spoken word</a> section of the song ("When a man lies, he murders some part of the world. These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives.") was written by German poet <a href="Paul%20Gerhardt">Paul Gerhardt</a>, but was erroneously attributed to Burton in the liner notes. The second half of the speech ("All this I cannot bear to witness any longer. Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home?") was written by Burton.

Released on August 25, 1988, by <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a>, "…And Justice for All" was acclaimed by <a href="music%20journalism">music critics</a>. In a contemporary review for "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", Michael Azerrad said that Metallica's compositions are impressive and called the album's music "a marvel of precisely channeled aggression". "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" magazine's Sharon Liveten called it a "gem of a double record" and found the music both edgy and technically proficient. Simon Reynolds, writing in "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>", said that "other bands would <a href="wikt%3Agive%20one%27s%20eye-teeth">give their eye teeth</a>" for the songs' riffs and found the album's densely complicated style of metal to be distinct from the monotonous sound of contemporary rock music: "Everything depends on utter punctuality and supreme surgical finesse. It's probably the most incisive music I've ever heard, in the literal sense of the word." Borivoj Krgin of "<a href="Metal%20Forces">Metal Forces</a>" said that it was the most ideal album he has heard because of typically exceptional production and musicianship that is more impressive than that of "Master of Puppets". In a less enthusiastic review for "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>", <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> believed that the band's compositions lack song form and that the album "goes on longer" than "Master of Puppets". In 1988, "…And Justice for All" was nominated for a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Hard%20Rock/Metal%20Performance%20Vocal%20or%20Instrumental">Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance</a>, but controversially lost to <a href="Jethro%20Tull%20%28band%29">Jethro Tull</a>'s "<a href="Crest%20of%20a%20Knave">Crest of a Knave</a>". In 2007, "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>", named this one of the 10 biggest upsets in Grammy history.

In a retrospective review, <a href="Greg%20Kot">Greg Kot</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" said that "…And Justice for All" was both the band's "most ambitious" and ultimately "flattest-sounding" album. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s Steve Huey noted that Metallica followed the blueprint of the previous two albums, with more sophisticated songs and "apocalyptic" lyrics that envisioned a society in decay. Music journalist <a href="Mick%20Wall">Mick Wall</a> was critical of the progressive elements on the album and believed that, apart from "One" and "Dyers Eve", most of the album sounded clumsy. <a href="Colin%20Larkin%20%28writer%29">Colin Larkin</a>, writing in the "<a href="Encyclopedia%20of%20Popular%20Music">Encyclopedia of Popular Music</a>" (2006), wrote that, apart from the praiseworthy "One", the album diminished the band's creativity by concentrating the songs with too many riffs. Ulrich said in retrospect that the album has improved with time and it is well-liked among their contemporaries.

In "The Village Voice"s annual <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a> critics poll, "…And Justice for All" was voted the 39th best album of 1988, having received 117 votes, including 12 first-place votes. The album was ranked at number nine on <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Top 25 Metal Albums. In a 2006 reader poll by "<a href="Guitar%20World">Guitar World</a>", "…And Justice for All" was placed 12th among the 100 Greatest Guitar Albums. All of the album's tracks were featured on "The 100 Greatest Metallica Songs of All Time" made by the same magazine. "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>" listed the album at number 42 among the "100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time". Martin Popoff ranks the effort at number 19 in his book "The Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time", the fourth highest ranked Metallica album on the list. The album is featured in Robert Dimery's "<a href="1001%20Albums%20You%20Must%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</a>". In 2017, it was ranked 21st on "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" list of "100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time".

After years of refusing to release music videos, Metallica released its first for "One". The video was controversial among fans, who had valued the band's apparent opposition to <a href="MTV">MTV</a> and other forms of mainstream music. "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>" ranked it number 48 on their list of the "100 Greatest Music Videos", saying that Metallica "evoke a revolution of the soul far more devastating than that presented in the original text". The guitar solo was ranked number seven in "Guitar World"'s compilation of the 100 Greatest Guitar Solos of all time. Additionally, heavy metal website <a href="Noisecreep">Noisecreep</a> classed the song ninth among the "10 Best '80s Metal Songs".

Although Metallica's music was considered unappealing for mainstream radio, "…And Justice for All" became the first underground metal album to achieve chart success in the US. It became Metallica's best-selling album upon release, peaking at number six on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, where it charted for 83 weeks. Since 1991, when <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a> began tracking sales, "…And Justice for All" has sold over 8,000,000 copies in the United States. It was certified platinum nine weeks after it was released in stores, and sold 1.7 million copies in the US by the end of 1988. Since its release, the album has scanned more than 8 million copies in the US and, according to MTV's Chris Harris, "helped cement [Metallica's] status as a rock and roll force to be reckoned with". "<a href="Classic%20Rock%20%28magazine%29">Classic Rock</a>" explained that with this album, Metallica received substantial media exposure, becoming a multi-platinum act by 1990. The group broke through on radio in early 1989 with "One", which was released as the third single from the record. According to <a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">"Billboard"</a>, "…And Justice for All" found the band evolving into arena headliners, as "One", accompanied by the group's first music video, garnered significant airplay.

"…And Justice for All" achieved similar chart success outside the United States. It peaked within the top 5 on the charts in <a href="Media%20Control%20Charts">Germany</a>, <a href="Sverigetopplistan">Sweden</a>, and the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">United Kingdom</a>, and remained on the UK chart for six weeks. The album managed to peak in the top 10 on the <a href="The%20Official%20Finnish%20Charts">Finnish</a>, <a href="VG-lista">Norwegian</a>, and <a href="Swiss%20Hitparade">Swiss</a> album charts. It was less successful in Spain, Mexico, and France, where it peaked at number 92 on the former chart, number 130 on the latter, and number 64 in Spain. "…And Justice for All" received a three times platinum certification from <a href="Music%20Canada">Music Canada</a> for shipping 300,000 copies, a platinum certification from <a href="IFPI%20Finland">IFPI Finland</a> for having a shipment of little over 50,000 copies, and was certified gold by the <a href="Bundesverband%20Musikindustrie">Bundesverband Musikindustrie</a> (BVMI) for shipments of 250,000 copies. It was awarded gold by the <a href="British%20Phonographic%20Industry">British Phonographic Industry</a> in 2013 for shipping 100,000 copies in the UK. "…And Justice for All" was surpassed commercially by the band's following album, "<a href="Metallica%20%28album%29">Metallica</a>" (1991).

Guitarist <a href="Kirk%20Hammett">Kirk Hammett</a> noted that the length of the songs was problematic for fans and for the band: "Touring behind it, we realized that the general consensus was that songs were too fucking long. One day after we played 'Justice' and got off the stage one of us said, 'we're never fucking playing that song again. Nevertheless, "One" quickly became a permanent fixture in the band's setlist. When performed live, the opening war sound is lengthened from seventeen seconds to approximately two minutes. At the song's conclusion, the stage turns pitch-black and fire erupts from around the stage. The live performance is characterized as a "musical and visual highlight" by "Rolling Stone" journalist Denise Sheppard. Other songs from "…And Justice for All" that have frequently been performed are "Blackened" and "Harvester of Sorrow", which were often featured during the album's promotional <a href="Damaged%20Justice%20Tour">Damaged Justice Tour</a>.

Metallica played the title track in the opening show of the <a href="Sick%20of%20the%20Studio%20%2707">Sick of the Studio '07</a> tour, for the first time since October 1989, and made it a set-fixture for the remainder of that tour. A statue of Lady Justice is commonly placed on the scene, to be torn down as the song approaches its conclusion. "Eye of the Beholder" has not been played live since 1989; one such performance appears on Metallica's live extended play, "<a href="Six%20Feet%20Down%20Under">Six Feet Down Under</a>". During the <a href="World%20Magnetic%20Tour">World Magnetic Tour</a> in 2009, "The Shortest Straw" made its way back into the setlist after a 12-year absence, and has been sporadically performed since. "The Frayed Ends of Sanity" debuted live in <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a> on the Metallica By Request tour in 2014, although the band had previously played segments during solos, impromptu jams, or in a "Justice" medley. "To Live Is to Die" premiered at the band's 30th-anniversary concert at <a href="The%20Fillmore">The Fillmore</a> in San Francisco. "Dyers Eve" debuted live sixteen years after it was recorded, during the <a href="Madly%20in%20Anger%20with%20the%20World%20Tour">Madly in Anger with the World Tour</a> at <a href="The%20Forum%20%28Inglewood%29">The Forum</a> in Inglewood, California.

All lyrics were written by <a href="James%20Hetfield">James Hetfield</a>, except for the <a href="spoken%20word">spoken word</a> section of "To Live Is to Die", posthumously attributed to <a href="Cliff%20Burton">Cliff Burton</a>. The bonus tracks on the digital re-release were recorded live at the <a href="Seattle%20Coliseum">Seattle Coliseum</a>, <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> on August 29 and 30, 1989, and later appeared on the live album "" (1993).

Baron Munchausen

Baron Munchausen (; ) is a fictional <a href="German%20nobility">German nobleman</a> created by the German writer <a href="Rudolf%20Erich%20Raspe">Rudolf Erich Raspe</a> in his <a href="1785%20in%20literature">1785</a> book "<a href="Baron%20Munchausen%27s%20Narrative%20of%20his%20Marvellous%20Travels%20and%20Campaigns%20in%20Russia">Baron Munchausen's Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia</a>". The character is loosely based on a real <a href="Freiherr">baron</a>, Hieronymus Karl Friedrich, Freiherr von Münchhausen (; 1720–1797).

Born in <a href="Bodenwerder">Bodenwerder</a>, <a href="Electorate%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg</a>, the real-life Münchhausen fought for the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> in the <a href="Russo%E2%80%93Turkish%20War%20%281735%E2%80%9339%29">Russo-Turkish War of 1735–1739</a>. Upon retiring in 1760, he became a minor celebrity within German aristocratic circles for telling outrageous <a href="tall%20tale">tall tale</a>s based on his military career. After hearing some of Münchhausen's stories, Raspe adapted them <a href="anonymous%20work">anonymously</a> into literary form, first in German as ephemeral magazine pieces and then in English as the 1785 book, which was first published in <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a> by a bookseller named Smith. The book was soon translated into other European languages, including a German version expanded by the poet <a href="Gottfried%20August%20B%C3%BCrger">Gottfried August Bürger</a>. The real-life Münchhausen was deeply upset at the development of a fictional character bearing his name, and threatened legal proceedings against the book's publisher. Perhaps fearing a <a href="libel">libel</a> suit, Raspe never acknowledged his authorship of the work, which was only established posthumously.

The fictional Baron's exploits, <a href="First-person%20narrative">narrated in the first person</a>, focus on his impossible achievements as a sportsman, soldier, and traveller, for instance riding on a <a href="round%20shot">cannonball</a>, fighting a forty-foot crocodile, and <a href="Moon%20in%20fiction">travelling to the Moon</a>. Intentionally comedic, the stories play on the absurdity and inconsistency of Munchausen's claims, and contain an undercurrent of <a href="satire">social satire</a>. The earliest illustrations of the character, perhaps created by Raspe himself, depict Munchausen as slim and youthful, although later illustrators have depicted him as an older man, and have added the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache that have become part of the character's definitive visual representation. Raspe's book was a major international success, becoming the core text for numerous English, continental European, and American editions that were expanded and rewritten by other writers. The book in its various revised forms remained widely read throughout the 19th century, especially in editions for young readers.

Versions of the fictional Baron have appeared on stage, screen, radio, and television, as well as in other literary works. Though the Baron Munchausen stories are no longer well-known in many English-speaking countries, they are still popular in continental Europe. The character has inspired numerous memorials and museums, and several medical conditions and other concepts are named after him, including <a href="Munchausen%20syndrome">Munchausen syndrome</a>, the <a href="M%C3%BCnchhausen%20trilemma">Münchhausen trilemma</a>, and <a href="Munchausen%20number">Munchausen number</a>s.

Hieronymus Karl Friedrich von Münchhausen was born on 11 May 1720 in <a href="Bodenwerder">Bodenwerder</a>, <a href="Electorate%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg</a>. He was a younger son of the "Black Line" of Rinteln-Bodenwerder, an aristocratic family in the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg</a>. His cousin, <a href="Gerlach%20Adolph%20von%20M%C3%BCnchhausen">Gerlach Adolph von Münchhausen</a>, was the founder of the <a href="University%20of%20G%C3%B6ttingen">University of Göttingen</a> and later the Prime Minister of the <a href="Electorate%20of%20Hanover">Electorate of Hanover</a>. Münchhausen started as a <a href="Page%20%28occupation%29">page</a> to <a href="Anthony%20Ulrich%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Anthony Ulrich II of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel</a>, and followed his employer to the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> during the <a href="Russo-Austro%E2%80%93Turkish%20War%20%281735%E2%80%9339%29">Russo-Austro–Turkish War (1735–39)</a>. In 1739, he was appointed a <a href="cornet%20%28military%20rank%29">cornet</a> in the Russian cavalry regiment, the Brunswick-<a href="Cuirassier">Cuirassier</a>s. On 27 November 1740, he was promoted to <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a>. He was stationed in <a href="Riga">Riga</a>, but participated in two campaigns against the Turks in 1740 and 1741. In 1744 he married Jacobine von Dunten, and in 1750 he was promoted to "<a href="Rittmeister">Rittmeister</a>" (cavalry <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a>).

In 1760 Münchhausen retired to live as a "<a href="Freiherr">Freiherr</a>" at his estates in Bodenwerder, where he remained until his death in 1797. It was there, especially at parties given for the area's aristocrats, that he developed a reputation as an imaginative after-dinner storyteller, creating witty and highly exaggerated accounts of his adventures in Russia. Over the ensuing thirty years, his storytelling abilities gained such renown that he frequently received visits from travelling nobles wanting to hear his tales. One guest described Münchhausen as telling his stories "cavalierly, indeed with military emphasis, yet without any concession to the whimsicality of the man of the world; describing his adventures as one would incidents which were in the natural course of events". Rather than being considered a liar, Münchhausen was seen as an honest man. As another contemporary put it, Münchhausen's unbelievable narratives were designed not to deceive, but "to ridicule the disposition for the marvellous which he observed in some of his acquaintances".

Münchhausen's wife Jacobine von Dunten died in 1790. In January 1794, Münchhausen married Bernardine von Brunn, fifty-seven years his junior. Von Brunn reportedly took ill soon after the marriage and spent the summer of 1794 in the <a href="spa%20town">spa town</a> of <a href="Bad%20Pyrmont">Bad Pyrmont</a>, although contemporary gossip claimed that she spent her time dancing and flirting. Von Brunn gave birth to a daughter, Maria Wilhemina, on 16 February 1795, nine months after her summer trip. Münchhausen filed an official complaint that the child was not his, and spent the last years of his life in divorce proceedings and <a href="alimony">alimony</a> litigation. Münchhausen died childless on 22 February 1797.

The fictionalized character was created by a German writer, scientist, and con artist, <a href="Rudolf%20Erich%20Raspe">Rudolf Erich Raspe</a>. Raspe probably met Hieronymus von Münchhausen while studying at the University of Göttingen, and may even have been invited to dine with him at the mansion at Bodenwerder. Raspe's later career mixed writing and scientific scholarship with theft and swindling; when the German police issued advertisements for his arrest in 1775, he fled continental Europe and settled in England.

In his native German language, Raspe wrote a collection of anecdotes inspired by Münchhausen's tales, calling the collection "M-h-s-nsche Geschichten" ("M-h-s-n Stories"). It remains unclear how much of Raspe's material comes directly from the Baron, but the majority of the stories are derived from older sources, including <a href="Heinrich%20Bebel">Heinrich Bebel</a>'s "Facetiæ" (1508) and <a href="Samuel%20Gotthold%20Lange">Samuel Gotthold Lange</a>'s "Deliciæ Academicæ" (1765). "M-h-s-nsche Geschichten" appeared as a feature in the eighth issue of the "Vade mecum für lustige Leute" ("Handbook for Fun-loving People"), a Berlin humor magazine, in 1781. Raspe published a sequel, "Noch zwei M-Lügen" ("Two more M-Fibs"), in the tenth issue of the same magazine in 1783. The hero and narrator of these stories was identified only as "M-h-s-n", keeping Raspe's inspiration partly obscured while still allowing knowledgeable German readers to make the connection to Münchhausen. Raspe's name did not appear at all.

In 1785, while supervising mines at <a href="Dolcoath">Dolcoath</a> in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, Raspe adapted the "Vade mecum" anecdotes into a short English-language book, this time identifying the narrator of the book as "Baron Munchausen". Other than the <a href="anglicization">anglicization</a> of Münchhausen to "Munchausen", Raspe this time made no attempt to hide the identity of the man who had inspired him, though he still withheld his own name.

This English edition, the first version of the text in which Munchausen appeared as a fully developed literary character, had a circuitous publication history. It first appeared anonymously as "Baron Munchausen's Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia", a 49-page book in <a href="12mo">12mo</a> size, published in <a href="Oxford%2C%20Oxfordshire">Oxford</a> by the bookseller Smith in late 1785 and sold for a <a href="shilling%20%28English%20coin%29">shilling</a>. A second edition released early the following year, retitled "Singular Travels, Campaigns, Voyages, and Sporting Adventures of Baron Munnikhouson, commonly pronounced Munchausen", added five more stories and four illustrations; though the book was still anonymous, the new text was probably by Raspe, and the illustrations may have been his work as well.

By May 1786, Raspe no longer had control over the book, which was taken over by a different publisher, G. Kearsley. Kearsley, intending the book for a higher-class audience than the original editions had been, commissioned extensive additions and revisions from other hands, including new stories, twelve new engravings, and much rewriting of Raspe's prose. This third edition was sold at two shillings, twice the price of the original, as "Gulliver Revived, or the Singular Travels, Campaigns, Voyages, and Adventures of Baron Munikhouson, commonly pronounced Munchausen".

Kearsley's version was a marked popular success. Over the next few years, the publishing house issued further editions in quick succession, adding still more non-Raspe material along the way; even the full-length "Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen", again not by Raspe and originally published in 1792 by a rival printer, was quickly subsumed into the body of stories. In the process of revision, Raspe's prose style was heavily modified; instead of his conversational language and sportsmanlike turns of phrase, Kearsley's writers opted for a blander and more formal tone imitating <a href="Augustan%20prose">Augustan prose</a>. Most ensuing English-language editions, including even the major editions produced by <a href="Thomas%20Seccombe">Thomas Seccombe</a> in 1895 and <a href="F.%20J.%20Harvey%20Darton">F. J. Harvey Darton</a> in 1930, reproduce one of the rewritten Kearsley versions rather than Raspe's original text.

At least ten editions or translations of the book appeared before Raspe's death in 1794. Translations of the book into French, Spanish, and German were published in 1786. The text reached the United States in 1805, expanded to include American topical satire by an anonymous <a href="Federalist%20Party">Federalist</a> writer, probably <a href="Thomas%20Green%20Fessenden">Thomas Green Fessenden</a>.

The first German translation, "Wunderbare Reisen zu Wasser und Lande", was made by the German <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> poet <a href="Gottfried%20August%20B%C3%BCrger">Gottfried August Bürger</a>. Bürger's text is a close translation of Smith's second edition, but also includes an interpolated story, based on a German legend called "<a href="The%20Six%20Wonderful%20Servants">The Six Wonderful Servants</a>". Two new engravings were added to illustrate the interpolated material. The German version of the stories proved to be even more popular than the English one. A second German edition in 1788 included heavily altered material from an expanded Kearsley edition, and an original German sequel, "Nachtrag zu den wunderbaren Reisen zu Wasser und Lande", was published in 1789. After these publications, the English and Continental versions of the Raspe text continued to diverge, following increasingly different traditions of included material.

Raspe, probably for fear of a <a href="libel">libel</a> suit from the real-life Baron von Münchhausen, never admitted his authorship of the book. It was often credited to Bürger, sometimes with an accompanying rumor that the real-life Baron von Münchhausen had met Bürger in Pyrmont and dictated the entire work to him. Another rumor, which circulated widely soon after the German translation was published, claimed that it was a competitive collaboration by three University of Göttingen scholars—Bürger, <a href="Abraham%20Gotthelf%20K%C3%A4stner">Abraham Gotthelf Kästner</a>, and <a href="Georg%20Christoph%20Lichtenberg">Georg Christoph Lichtenberg</a>—with each of the three trying to outdo one another by writing the most unbelievable tale. The scholar <a href="Johann%20Georg%20Meusel">Johann Georg Meusel</a> correctly credited Raspe for the core text, but mistakenly asserted that Raspe had written it in German and that an anonymous translator was responsible for the English version. Raspe's authorship was finally proven in 1824 by Bürger's biographer, <a href="Karl%20Reinhard%20%28biographer%29">Karl Reinhard</a>.

In the first few years after publication, German readers widely assumed that the real-life Baron von Münchhausen was responsible for the stories. According to witnesses, Münchhausen was deeply angry that the book had dragged his name into public consciousness and insulted his honor as a nobleman. Münchhausen became a recluse, refusing to host parties or tell any more stories, and he attempted without success to bring legal proceedings against Bürger and the publisher of the translation.

The following tables summarize the early publication history of Raspe's text, from 1785 to 1800. Unless otherwise referenced, information in the tables comes from the Munchausen bibliography established by <a href="J.%20P.%20Carswell">John Patrick Carswell</a>.

The fictional Baron Munchausen is a <a href="Alazon%23Miles%20Gloriosus">braggart soldier</a>, most strongly defined by his comically exaggerated <a href="boast">boast</a>s about his own adventures; all of the stories in Raspe's book are told in <a href="first-person%20narrative">first-person narrative</a>, with a prefatory note explaining that "the Baron is supposed to relate these extraordinary Adventures over his Bottle, when surrounded by his Friends". The Baron's stories imply him to be a <a href="superhuman">superhuman</a> figure who spends most of his time either getting out of absurd predicaments or indulging in equally absurd moments of gentle mischief. In some of his best-known stories, the Baron rides a <a href="Round%20shot">cannonball</a>, <a href="Moon%20in%20fiction">travels to the Moon</a>, is swallowed by a giant fish in the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, saves himself from drowning by pulling on his own hair, fights a forty-foot crocodile, enlists a wolf to pull his sleigh, and uses <a href="Laurus%20nobilis">laurel tree</a> branches to fix his horse when the animal is accidentally cut in two.

In the stories he narrates, the Baron is shown as a calm, <a href="rationality">rational</a> man, describing what he experiences with simple <a href="objectivity%20%28philosophy%29">objectivity</a>; absurd happenings elicit, at most, mild surprise from him, and he shows serious doubt about any unlikely events he has not witnessed himself. The resulting narrative effect is an ironic tone, encouraging skepticism in the reader and marked by a running undercurrent of subtle <a href="satire">social satire</a>. In addition to his fearlessness when hunting and fighting, he is suggested to be a debonair, polite gentleman given to moments of <a href="%3Awikt%3Agallantry">gallantry</a>, with a scholarly penchant for knowledge, a tendency to be pedantically accurate about details in his stories, and a deep appreciation for food and drink of all kinds. The Baron also provides a solid geographical and social context for his narratives, peppering them with topical allusions and satire about recent events; indeed, many of the references in Raspe's original text are to historical incidents in the real-life Münchhausen's military career.

Because the feats the Baron describes are overtly implausible, they are easily recognizable as fiction, with a strong implication that the Baron is a liar. Whether he expects his audience to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe's original 1785 text, he simply narrates his stories without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that he is telling the truth. In any case, the Baron appears to believe every word of his own stories, no matter how internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly indifferent to any disbelief he encounters in others.

Illustrators of the Baron stories have included <a href="Thomas%20Rowlandson">Thomas Rowlandson</a>, <a href="Alfred%20Crowquill">Alfred Crowquill</a>, <a href="George%20Cruikshank">George Cruikshank</a>, <a href="Ernst%20Ludwig%20Riepenhausen">Ernst Ludwig Riepenhausen</a>, <a href="Theodor%20Hosemann">Theodor Hosemann</a>, <a href="Adolf%20Schr%C3%B6dter">Adolf Schrödter</a>, <a href="Gustave%20Dor%C3%A9">Gustave Doré</a>, <a href="William%20Strang">William Strang</a>, <a href="W.%20Heath%20Robinson">W. Heath Robinson</a>, and <a href="Ronald%20Searle">Ronald Searle</a>. The Finnish-American cartoonist <a href="Klaus%20Nordling">Klaus Nordling</a> featured the Baron in a weekly "Baron Munchausen" comic strip from 1935 to 1937, and in 1962, Raspe's text was adapted for "<a href="Classics%20Illustrated">Classics Illustrated</a>" #146 (British series), with both interior and cover art by the British cartoonist <a href="Denis%20Gifford">Denis Gifford</a>.

In the first published illustrations, which may have been drawn by Raspe himself, the Baron appears slim and youthful. For the 1792 "Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen", an anonymous artist drew the Baron as a dignified but tired old soldier whose face is marred by injuries from his adventures; this illustration remained the standard portrait of the Baron for about seventy years, and its imagery was echoed in Cruikshank's depictions of the character. Doré, illustrating a <a href="Th%C3%A9ophile%20Gautier%2C%20fils">Théophile Gautier "fils"</a> translation in 1862, retained the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache from the 1792 portrait, but gave the Baron a healthier and more affable appearance; the Doré Baron became the definitive visual representation for the character.

The relationship between the real and fictional Barons is complex. On the one hand, the fictional Baron Munchausen can be easily distinguished from the historical figure Hieronymus von Münchhausen; the character is so separate from his namesake that at least one critic, the writer <a href="W.%20L.%20George">W. L. George</a>, concluded that the namesake's identity was irrelevant to the general reader, and <a href="Richard%20Asher">Richard Asher</a> named <a href="Munchausen%20syndrome">Munchausen syndrome</a> using the anglicized spelling so that the disorder would reference the character rather than the real person. On the other hand, Münchhausen remains strongly connected to the character he inspired, and is still nicknamed the "Lügenbaron" ("Baron of Lies") in German. As the Munchausen researcher Bernhard Wiebel has said, "These two barons are the same and they are not the same."

Reviewing the first edition of Raspe's book in December 1785, a writer in "<a href="The%20Critical%20Review">The Critical Review</a>" commented appreciatively:

A writer for "<a href="The%20English%20Review">The English Review</a>" around the same time was less approving: "We do not understand how a collection of lies can be called a satire on lying, any more than the adventures of a woman of pleasure can be called a satire on fornication."

W. L. George described the fictional Baron as a "comic giant" of literature, describing his boasts as "splendid, purposeless lie[s] born of the joy of life". Théophile Gautier "fils" highlighted that the Baron's adventures are endowed with an "absurd logic pushed to the extreme and which backs away from nothing". According to an interview, <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a> relished reading the Baron stories as a child, and used them as inspiration for his own adventure novels. <a href="Thomas%20Seccombe">Thomas Seccombe</a> commented that "Munchausen has undoubtedly achieved [a permanent place in literature] ... The Baron's notoriety is universal, his character proverbial, and his name as familiar as that of Mr. <a href="Lemuel%20Gulliver">Lemuel Gulliver</a>, or <a href="Robinson%20Crusoe">Robinson Crusoe</a>."

<a href="Steven%20T.%20Byington">Steven T. Byington</a> wrote that "Munchausen's modest seat in the <a href="Valhalla">Valhalla</a> of classic literature is undisputed", comparing the stories to American <a href="tall%20tale">tall tale</a>s and concluding that the Baron is "the patriarch, the perfect model, the fadeless fragrant flower, of liberty from accuracy". The folklore writer <a href="Alvin%20Schwartz%20%28children%27s%20author%29">Alvin Schwartz</a> cited the Baron stories as one of the most important influences on the American tall tale tradition. In a 2012 study of the Baron, the literary scholar Sarah Tindal Kareem noted that "Munchausen embodies, in his deadpan presentation of absurdities, the novelty of fictionality [and] the sophistication of aesthetic illusion", adding that the additions to Raspe's text made by Kearsley and others tend to mask these ironic literary qualities by emphasizing that the Baron is lying.

By the beginning of the 19th century, Kearsley's phenomenally popular version of Raspe's book had spread to abridged <a href="chapbook">chapbook</a> editions for young readers, who soon became the main audience for the stories. The book, especially in its adaptations for children, remained widely popular throughout the century. It was translated into nearly all languages spoken in Europe; <a href="Robert%20Southey">Robert Southey</a> referred to it as "a book which everybody knows, because all boys read it". Notable later translations include Gautier's French rendering and <a href="Korney%20Chukovsky">Korney Chukovsky</a>'s popular Russian adaptation. By the 1850s, "Munchausen" had come into <a href="slang">slang</a> use as a verb meaning "to tell extravagantly untruthful pseudo-autobiographical stories". <a href="Robert%20Chambers%20%28publisher%20born%201802%29">Robert Chambers</a>, in an 1863 almanac, cited the iconic 1792 illustration of the Baron by asking rhetorically:

Though Raspe's book is no longer widely read by English speakers, the Munchausen stories remain popular in Europe, especially in Germany and in Russia.

As well as the many augmented and adapted editions of Raspe's text, the fictional Baron has occasionally appeared in other standalone works. In 1838–39, <a href="Karl%20Leberecht%20Immermann">Karl Leberecht Immermann</a> published the long novel "Münchhausen: Eine Geschichte in Arabesken" ("Münchhausen: A History of Arabesques") as an homage to the character, and <a href="Adolf%20Ellissen">Adolf Ellissen</a>'s "Munchausens Lügenabenteur", an elaborate expansion of the stories, appeared in 1846. In his 1886 philosophical treatise "<a href="Beyond%20Good%20and%20Evil">Beyond Good and Evil</a>", <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> uses one of the Baron's adventures, the one in which he rescues himself from a swamp, as a metaphor for belief in complete metaphysical <a href="free%20will">free will</a>; Nietzsche calls this belief an attempt "to pull oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the swamps of nothingness".

In the late 19th century, the Baron appeared as a character in <a href="John%20Kendrick%20Bangs">John Kendrick Bangs</a>'s comic novels "<a href="A%20House-Boat%20on%20the%20Styx">A House-Boat on the Styx</a>", "<a href="Pursuit%20of%20the%20House-Boat">Pursuit of the House-Boat</a>", and "<a href="The%20Enchanted%20Type-Writer">The Enchanted Type-Writer</a>". Shortly after, in 1901, Bangs published "<a href="Mr.%20Munchausen">Mr. Munchausen</a>", a collection of new Munchausen stories, closely following the style and humor of the original tales. <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>'s second novel, "Baron Münchhausen's New Scientific Adventures", put the Baron character in a <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> setting; the novel was serialized in "<a href="The%20Electrical%20Experimenter">The Electrical Experimenter</a>" from May 1915 to February 1917.

<a href="Pierre%20Henri%20Cami">Pierre Henri Cami</a>'s character Baron de Crac, a French soldier and courtier under <a href="Louis%20XV%20of%20France">Louis XV</a>, is an imitation of the Baron Munchausen stories. In 1998, the British game designer <a href="James%20Wallis%20%28games%20designer%29">James Wallis</a> used the Baron character to create a multi-player <a href="storytelling%20game">storytelling game</a>, "<a href="The%20Extraordinary%20Adventures%20of%20Baron%20Munchausen">The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a>", in which players improvise Munchausen-like first-person stories while overcoming objections and other interruptions from opponents. The American writer <a href="Peter%20David">Peter David</a> had the Baron narrate an original short story, "Diego and the Baron", in 2018.

<a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells%20Theatre">Sadler's Wells Theatre</a> produced the <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a> "Baron Munchausen; or, Harlequin's Travels" in London in 1795, starring the actor-singer-caricaturist <a href="Robert%20Dighton">Robert Dighton</a> as the Baron; another pantomime based on the Raspe text, "Harlequin Munchausen, or the Fountain of Love", was produced in London in 1818. <a href="Herbert%20Eulenberg">Herbert Eulenberg</a> made the Baron the main character of a 1900 play, "Münchhausen", and the <a href="Expressionist">Expressionist</a> writer <a href="Walter%20Hasenclever">Walter Hasenclever</a> turned the stories into a comedy, "Münchhausen", in 1934. <a href="Grigori%20Gorin">Grigori Gorin</a> used the Baron as the hero of his 1976 play "That Very Munchausen"; a <a href="That%20Very%20Munchausen">film version</a> was made in 1980. "Baron Prášil", a Czech musical about the Baron, opened in 2010 in <a href="Prague%2C%20Czech%20Republic">Prague</a>. The following year, the National Black Light Theatre of Prague toured the United Kingdom with a nonmusical production of "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen".

In 1932, the comedy writer Billy Wells adapted Baron Munchausen for a <a href="radio%20comedy">radio comedy</a> routine starring the comedians <a href="Jack%20Pearl">Jack Pearl</a> and Cliff Hall. In the routine, Pearl's Baron would relate his unbelievable experiences in a thick German accent to Hall's <a href="Straight%20man">"straight man" character</a>, Charlie. When Charlie had had enough and expressed disbelief, the Baron would invariably retort: "Vass "you" dere, Sharlie?" The line became a popular and much-quoted <a href="catchphrase">catchphrase</a>, and by early 1933 "The Jack Pearl Show" was the second most popular series on American radio (after <a href="Eddie%20Cantor">Eddie Cantor</a>'s program). Pearl attempted to adapt his portrayal to film in "<a href="Meet%20the%20Baron">Meet the Baron</a>" in 1933, playing a modern character mistaken for the Baron, but the film was not a success. Pearl's popularity gradually declined between 1933 and 1937, though he attempted to revive the Baron character several times before ending his last radio series in 1951.

For a 1972 <a href="Caedmon%20Records">Caedmon Records</a> recording of some of the stories, <a href="Peter%20Ustinov">Peter Ustinov</a> voiced the Baron. A review in "<a href="The%20Reading%20Teacher">The Reading Teacher</a>" noted that Ustinov's portrayal highlighted "the braggadocio personality of the Baron", with "self-adulation ... plainly discernible in the intonational innuendo".

The early French filmmaker <a href="Georges%20M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s">Georges Méliès</a>, who greatly admired the Baron Munchausen stories, filmed "<a href="Baron%20Munchausen%27s%20Dream">Baron Munchausen's Dream</a>" in 1911. Méliès's short silent film, which has little in common with the Raspe text, follows a sleeping Baron through a surrealistic succession of intoxication-induced dreams. Méliès may also have used the Baron's journey to the moon as an inspiration for his well-known 1902 film "<a href="A%20Trip%20to%20the%20Moon">A Trip to the Moon</a>". In the late 1930s, he planned to collaborate with the <a href="Dada">Dada</a> artist <a href="Hans%20Richter%20%28artist%29">Hans Richter</a> on a new film version of the Baron stories, but the project was left unfinished at his death in 1938. Richter attempted to complete it the following year, taking on <a href="Jacques%20Pr%C3%A9vert">Jacques Prévert</a>, <a href="Jacques%20Brunius">Jacques Brunius</a>, and <a href="Maurice%20Henry">Maurice Henry</a> as screenwriters, but the beginning of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> put a permanent halt to the production.

The French animator <a href="%C3%89mile%20Cohl">Émile Cohl</a> produced a version of the stories using <a href="silhouette">silhouette</a> <a href="cutout%20animation">cutout animation</a> in 1913; other animated versions were produced by Richard Felgenauer in Germany in 1920, and by Paul Peroff in the United States in 1929. <a href="Colonel%20Heeza%20Liar">Colonel Heeza Liar</a>, the protagonist of the first animated cartoon series in cinema history, was created by <a href="John%20Randolph%20Bray">John Randolph Bray</a> in 1913 as an amalgamation of the Baron and <a href="Teddy%20Roosevelt">Teddy Roosevelt</a>. The Italian director <a href="Paolo%20Azzurri">Paolo Azzurri</a> filmed "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen" in 1914, and the British director <a href="F.%20Martin%20Thornton">F. Martin Thornton</a> made a short silent film featuring the Baron, "The New Adventures of Baron Munchausen", the following year. In 1940, the Czech director <a href="Martin%20Fri%C4%8D">Martin Frič</a> filmed "<a href="Baron%20Pr%C3%A1%C5%A1il%20%28film%29">Baron Prášil</a>", starring the comic actor <a href="Vlasta%20Burian">Vlasta Burian</a> as a 20th-century descendant of the Baron.

For the German film studio <a href="Universum%20Film%20AG">Ufa</a>'s 25th anniversary in 1943, <a href="Joseph%20Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a> hired the filmmaker <a href="Josef%20von%20B%C3%A1ky">Josef von Báky</a> to direct "<a href="M%C3%BCnchhausen%20%28film%29">Münchhausen</a>", a big-budget color film about the Baron. David Stewart Hull describes <a href="Hans%20Albers">Hans Albers</a>'s Baron as "jovial but somewhat sinister", while Tobias Nagle writes that Albers imparts "a male and muscular zest for action and testosterone-driven adventure". A German musical comedy, "<a href="M%C3%BCnchhausen%20in%20Afrika">Münchhausen in Afrika</a>", made as a vehicle for the Austrian singing star <a href="Peter%20Alexander%20%28Austrian%20performer%29">Peter Alexander</a>, appeared in 1957. <a href="Karel%20Zeman">Karel Zeman</a>'s 1961 Czech film "<a href="The%20Fabulous%20Baron%20Munchausen">The Fabulous Baron Munchausen</a>" commented on the Baron's adventures from a contemporary perspective, highlighting the importance of the poetic imagination to scientific achievement; Zeman's stylized "<a href="mise-en-sc%C3%A8ne">mise-en-scène</a>", based on Doré's illustrations for the book, combined animation with live-action actors, including <a href="Milo%C5%A1%20Kopeck%C3%BD">Miloš Kopecký</a> as the Baron.

In the Soviet Union in 1929, Daniil Cherkes released a cartoon, "Adventures of Munchausen". In the <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, <a href="Soyuzmultfilm">Soyuzmultfilm</a> released a 16-minute <a href="stop-motion%20animation">stop-motion animation</a> "Adventures of Baron Munchausen" in 1967, directed by Anatoly Karanovich. Another Soviet animated version was produced as a series of short films, "<a href="Munchausen%27s%20Adventures">Munchausen's Adventures</a>", in 1973 and 1974. The French animator <a href="Jean%20Image">Jean Image</a> filmed "<a href="The%20Fabulous%20Adventures%20of%20the%20Legendary%20Baron%20Munchausen">The Fabulous Adventures of the Legendary Baron Munchausen</a>" in 1979, and followed it with a 1984 sequel, "<a href="Moon%20Madness%20%28film%29">Moon Madness</a>". <a href="Oleg%20Yankovsky">Oleg Yankovsky</a> appeared as the Baron in the 1979 Russian television film "<a href="The%20Very%20Same%20Munchhausen">The Very Same Munchhausen</a>", directed by <a href="Mark%20Zakharov">Mark Zakharov</a> from Grigori Gorin's screenplay, produced and released by Mosfilm. The film, a satirical commentary on Soviet censorship and social mores, imagines an ostracized Baron attempting to prove the truth of his adventures in a disbelieving and <a href="conformity">conformity</a>-driven world.

In 1988, <a href="Terry%20Gilliam">Terry Gilliam</a> adapted the Raspe stories into a lavish Hollywood film, "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Baron%20Munchausen">The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a>", with the British stage actor and director <a href="John%20Neville%20%28actor%29">John Neville</a> in the lead. <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>, in his review of the film, described Neville's Baron as a man who "seems sensible and matter-of-fact, as anyone would if they had spent a lifetime growing accustomed to the incredible". 

The German actor <a href="Jan%20Josef%20Liefers">Jan Josef Liefers</a> starred in a 2012 two-part <a href="television%20film">television film</a> titled "<a href="Baron%20M%C3%BCnchhausen%20%282012%20film%29">Baron Münchhausen</a>"; according to a "<a href="Spiegel%20Online">Spiegel Online</a>" review, his characterization of the Baron strongly resembled <a href="Johnny%20Depp">Johnny Depp</a>'s performance as <a href="Jack%20Sparrow">Jack Sparrow</a> in the "<a href="Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean%20%28film%20series%29">Pirates of the Caribbean</a>" film series.

In 2004, a fan club calling itself Munchausen's Grandchildren was founded in the Russian city of <a href="Kaliningrad">Kaliningrad</a> (formerly <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg">Königsberg</a>). The club's early activities included identifying "historical proofs" of the fictional Baron's travels through Königsberg, such as a <a href="jackboot">jackboot</a> supposedly belonging to the Baron and a <a href="sperm%20whale">sperm whale</a> skeleton said to be that of the whale in whose belly the Baron was trapped.

On 18 June 2005, to celebrate the 750th anniversary of Kaliningrad, a monument to the Baron was unveiled as a gift from Bodenwerder, portraying the Baron's cannonball ride. Bodenwerder sports a Munchausen monument in front of its Town Hall, as well a Munchausen museum including a large collection of illustrated editions of the stories. Another Munchausen Museum ("Minhauzena Muzejs") exists in Duntes Muiža, <a href="Liepupe%20parish">Liepupe parish</a>, <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a>, home of the real Baron's first wife; the couple had lived in the town for six years, before moving back to the baronial estate in Hanover. In 2005, to mark the real-life Baron's 285th birthday, the <a href="National%20Bank%20of%20Latvia">National Bank of Latvia</a> issued a commemorative silver coin.

In 1951, the British physician <a href="Richard%20Asher">Richard Asher</a> published an article in "<a href="The%20Lancet">The Lancet</a>" describing patients whose <a href="factitious%20disorder">factitious disorder</a>s led them to lie about their own states of health. Asher proposed to call the disorder "Munchausen's syndrome", commenting: "Like the famous Baron von Munchausen, the persons affected have always travelled widely; and their stories, like those attributed to him, are both dramatic and untruthful. Accordingly, the syndrome is respectfully dedicated to the baron, and named after him". The disease is now usually referred to as <a href="Munchausen%20syndrome">Munchausen syndrome</a>. The name has spawned two other coinages: <a href="Munchausen%20syndrome%20by%20proxy">Munchausen syndrome by proxy</a>, in which illness is feigned by caretakers rather than patients, and <a href="Munchausen%20by%20Internet">Munchausen by Internet</a>, in which illness is feigned online.

In 1968, <a href="Hans%20Albert">Hans Albert</a> coined the term <a href="M%C3%BCnchhausen%20trilemma">Münchhausen trilemma</a> to describe the philosophical problem inherent in having to derive conclusions from premises; those premises have to be derived from still other premises, and so on forever, leading to an <a href="infinite%20regress">infinite regress</a> interruptible only by <a href="circular%20logic">circular logic</a> or <a href="dogmatism">dogmatism</a>. The problem is named after the similarly paradoxical story in which the Baron saves himself from being drowned in a swamp by pulling on his own hair. The same story also inspired the mathematical term <a href="Munchausen%20number">Munchausen number</a>, coined by Daan van Berkel in 2009 to describe numbers whose digits, when raised to their own powers, can be added together to form the number itself (for example, 3435 = 3 + 4 + 3 + 5).

Subclass ATU1889 of the <a href="Aarne%E2%80%93Thompson%E2%80%93Uther%20classification%20system">Aarne–Thompson–Uther classification system</a>, a standard index of folklore, was named "Münchhausen Tales" in tribute to the stories. In 1994, a <a href="main%20belt%20asteroid">main belt asteroid</a> was named <a href="14014%20M%C3%BCnchhausen">14014 Münchhausen</a> in honor of both the real and the fictional Baron.

Antonin Scalia

Antonin Gregory Scalia (; March 11, 1936 – February 13, 2016) was an <a href="Associate%20Justice%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Associate Justice</a> of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> from 1986 until his death in 2016. Appointed to the Court by <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> in 1986, Scalia was described as the intellectual anchor for the <a href="originalist">originalist</a> and <a href="textualist">textualist</a> position in the Court's conservative wing.

Scalia was born in <a href="Trenton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Trenton, New Jersey</a>. He attended <a href="Xavier%20High%20School%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Xavier High School</a> in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> and then college at <a href="Georgetown%20University">Georgetown University</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> He obtained his law degree from <a href="Harvard%20Law%20School">Harvard Law School</a> and spent six years in a <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a> law firm before becoming a law school professor at the <a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a>. In the early 1970s, he served in the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Richard%20Nixon">Nixon</a> and <a href="Presidency%20of%20Gerald%20Ford">Ford</a> administrations, eventually as an <a href="United%20States%20Assistant%20Attorney%20General">Assistant Attorney General</a>. He spent most of the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Jimmy%20Carter">Carter</a> years teaching at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, where he became one of the first faculty advisers of the fledgling <a href="Federalist%20Society">Federalist Society</a>. In 1982, Ronald Reagan appointed him as judge of the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a>.
In 1986, Reagan appointed him to the Supreme Court. Scalia was unanimously confirmed by the Senate, becoming the Court's first <a href="Italian%20Americans">Italian-American</a> justice. He served on the Court for nearly thirty years until his death on February 13, 2016.

Scalia espoused a conservative jurisprudence and ideology, advocating <a href="textualism">textualism</a> in <a href="statutory%20interpretation">statutory interpretation</a> and <a href="originalism">originalism</a> in <a href="constitutional%20interpretation">constitutional interpretation</a>. He was a strong defender of the powers of the executive branch, believing presidential power should be paramount in many areas. He believed that the Constitution permitted the <a href="Capital%20punishment%20in%20the%20United%20States">death penalty</a> and did not guarantee the right to <a href="Abortion%20in%20the%20United%20States">abortion</a> or <a href="Same-sex%20marriage%20in%20the%20United%20States">same-sex marriage</a>, and that <a href="Affirmative%20action%20in%20the%20United%20States">affirmative action</a> and most other policies that afforded special protected status to <a href="minority%20groups">minority groups</a> were unconstitutional. These positions earned him a reputation as one of the most conservative justices on the Court. He filed separate opinions in many cases, often castigating the Court's majority using scathing language. Scalia's most significant opinions include his lone dissent in "<a href="Morrison%20v.%20Olson">Morrison v. Olson</a>" (against the constitutionality of an <a href="Independent%20Counsel%20Act">Independent-Counsel law</a>), his majority opinion in "<a href="Crawford%20v.%20Washington">Crawford v. Washington</a>" (defining a criminal defendant's <a href="Confrontation%20Clause">confrontation right</a> under the <a href="Sixth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">6th Amendment</a>), and his majority opinion in "<a href="District%20of%20Columbia%20v.%20Heller">District of Columbia v. Heller</a>" (holding that the <a href="2nd%20Amendment">2nd Amendment</a> guarantees a right to individual handgun ownership). 

Scalia was posthumously awarded the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> in 2018.

Antonin Scalia was born on March 11, 1936, in <a href="Trenton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Trenton, New Jersey</a> and was an only child. His father, Salvatore Eugene Scalia (1903–1986), an Italian immigrant from <a href="Sommatino">Sommatino</a>, <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, graduated from <a href="Rutgers%20University">Rutgers University</a> and was a graduate student at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> and clerk at the time of his son's birth. The elder Scalia would become a professor of <a href="Romance%20language">Romance language</a>s at <a href="Brooklyn%20College">Brooklyn College</a>, where he was an adherent to the <a href="Formalism%20%28literature%29">formalist</a> <a href="New%20Criticism">New Criticism</a> school of literary theory. His mother, Catherine Louise (<a href="n%C3%A9e">née</a> Panaro) Scalia (1905–1985), was born in Trenton to Italian immigrant parents and worked as an elementary school teacher.

In 1939, Scalia and his family moved to the <a href="Elmhurst%2C%20Queens">Elmhurst</a> section of <a href="Queens">Queens</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>, where he attended P.S. 13. After completing <a href="eighth%20grade">eighth grade</a> in public school, he obtained an academic scholarship to <a href="Xavier%20High%20School%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Xavier High School</a>, a <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuit</a> military school in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, where he graduated first in the class of 1953 and served as <a href="valedictorian">valedictorian</a>. He later stated that he spent much of his time on schoolwork and admitted, "I was never cool". While a youth, he was also active as a <a href="Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America">Boy Scout</a> and was part of the Scouts' national honor society, the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Arrow">Order of the Arrow</a>.

Classmate and future New York State official William Stern remembered Scalia in his high school days: 
"This kid was a conservative when he was 17 years old. An archconservative Catholic. He could have been a member of the <a href="Roman%20Curia">Curia</a>. He was the top student in the class. He was brilliant, way above everybody else."

In 1953, Scalia enrolled at <a href="Georgetown%20College%20%28Georgetown%20University%29">Georgetown University</a>, where he graduated valedictorian and "<a href="summa%20cum%20laude">summa cum laude</a>" in 1957 with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> in history. While in college, he was a champion collegiate debater in Georgetown's <a href="Philodemic%20Society">Philodemic Society</a> and a critically praised thespian. He took his junior year abroad at the <a href="University%20of%20Fribourg">University of Fribourg</a>, Switzerland. Scalia studied law at <a href="Harvard%20Law%20School">Harvard Law School</a>, where he was a Notes Editor for the "<a href="Harvard%20Law%20Review">Harvard Law Review</a>". He graduated "<a href="magna%20cum%20laude">magna cum laude</a>" in 1960, becoming a Sheldon Fellow of <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>. The fellowship enabled him to travel in Europe during 1960 and 1961.

Scalia began his legal career at the international law firm <a href="Jones%2C%20Day%2C%20Cockley%20and%20Reavis">Jones, Day, Cockley and Reavis</a> in <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>, Ohio, where he worked from 1961 to 1967. He was highly regarded at the law firm and would most likely have been made a partner but later said he had long intended to teach. He became a professor of law at the <a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a> in 1967, moving his family to <a href="Charlottesville%2C%20Virginia">Charlottesville</a>.

After four years in Charlottesville, Scalia entered public service in 1971. President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> appointed him general counsel for the <a href="Office%20of%20Telecommunications%20Policy">Office of Telecommunications Policy</a>, where one of his principal assignments was to formulate federal policy for the growth of cable television. From 1972 to 1974, he was chairman of the <a href="Administrative%20Conference%20of%20the%20United%20States">Administrative Conference of the United States</a>, a small <a href="independent%20agency">independent agency</a> that sought to improve the functioning of the federal bureaucracy. In mid-1974, Nixon nominated him as <a href="United%20States%20Assistant%20Attorney%20General">Assistant Attorney General</a> for the <a href="Office%20of%20Legal%20Counsel">Office of Legal Counsel</a>. After Nixon's resignation, the nomination was continued by President <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a>, and Scalia was confirmed by the Senate on August 22, 1974.

In the aftermath of <a href="Watergate%20scandal">Watergate</a>, the Ford administration was engaged in a number of conflicts with Congress. Scalia repeatedly testified before congressional committees, defending Ford administration assertions of <a href="executive%20privilege">executive privilege</a> regarding its refusal to turn over documents. Within the administration, Scalia advocated a presidential veto for a bill to amend the <a href="Freedom%20of%20Information%20Act%20%28United%20States%29">Freedom of Information Act</a>, which would greatly increase the act's scope. Scalia's view prevailed, and Ford vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode it. In early 1976, Scalia argued his only case before the Supreme Court, "Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba". Scalia, on behalf of the US government, argued in support of Dunhill, and that position was successful.
Following Ford's defeat by President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>, Scalia worked for several months at the <a href="American%20Enterprise%20Institute">American Enterprise Institute</a>.

He then returned to academia, taking up residence at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> <a href="University%20of%20Chicago%20Law%20School">Law School</a> from 1977 to 1982, though he spent one year as a <a href="visiting%20professor">visiting professor</a> at <a href="Stanford%20Law%20School">Stanford Law School</a>. During Scalia's time at Chicago, <a href="Peter%20H.%20Russell">Peter H. Russell</a> hired him on behalf of the Canadian government to write a report on how the United States was able to limit the activities of its secret services for the <a href="Royal%20Commission%20of%20Inquiry%20into%20Certain%20Activities%20of%20the%20RCMP">McDonald Commission</a>, which was investigating abuses by the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a>. The report – finished in 1979 – encouraged the commission to recommend that a balance be struck between civil liberties and the essentially unchecked activities of the RCMP. In 1981, he became the first faculty adviser for the University of Chicago's chapter of the newly founded <a href="Federalist%20Society">Federalist Society</a>.

When <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> was elected president in November 1980, Scalia hoped for a major position in the new administration. He was interviewed for the position of <a href="Solicitor%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">Solicitor General of the United States</a>, but the position went to <a href="Rex%20E.%20Lee">Rex E. Lee</a>, to Scalia's great disappointment. Scalia was offered a seat on the Chicago-based <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Seventh%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> in early 1982 but declined it, hoping to be appointed to the highly influential <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> (D.C. Circuit). Later that year, Reagan offered Scalia a seat on the D.C. Circuit, which Scalia accepted. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August 5, 1982, and was sworn in on August 17, 1982.

On the D.C. Circuit, Scalia built a conservative record while winning applause in legal circles for powerful, witty legal writing, which was often critical of the Supreme Court precedents he felt bound as a lower-court judge to follow. Scalia's opinions drew the attention of Reagan administration officials, who, according to "The New York Times", "liked virtually everything they saw and ... listed him as a leading Supreme Court prospect". In 1985, though there was then no vacancy on the Court, Reagan administration officials put Scalia on a short list with fellow D.C. Circuit Judge <a href="Robert%20Bork">Robert Bork</a>, to be considered if a justice left the Court. In 1986, <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice</a> <a href="Warren%20Burger">Warren Burger</a> informed the White House of his intent to retire. Reagan first decided to nominate Associate Justice <a href="William%20Rehnquist">William Rehnquist</a> to become Chief Justice. That choice meant that Reagan would also have to choose a nominee to fill Rehnquist's seat as associate justice. Attorney General <a href="Edwin%20Meese">Edwin Meese</a>, who advised Reagan on the choice, seriously considered only Bork and Scalia. Feeling that this might well be Reagan's last opportunity to pick a Supreme Court justice, the president and his advisers chose Scalia over Bork. Many factors influenced the decision. Reagan wanted to appoint the first Italian-American justice. In addition, Scalia was ten years younger and would likely serve longer on the Court. Scalia also had the advantage of not having Bork's "paper trail"; the elder judge had written controversial articles about individual rights. Scalia was called to the White House and accepted Reagan's nomination.

When <a href="Senate%20Judiciary%20Committee">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> hearings on Scalia's nomination opened in August 1986, he faced a committee that had just argued divisively over the Rehnquist nomination. Witnesses and Democratic senators contended that before becoming a judge, Rehnquist had engaged in activities designed to discourage minorities from voting. Committee members had little taste for a second battle over Scalia and were in any event reluctant to oppose the first Italian-American Supreme Court nominee. The judge was not pressed heavily on controversial issues such as abortion or civil rights. Scalia, who attended the hearing with his wife and nine children seated behind him, found time for a humorous exchange with Democratic Ohio Senator <a href="Howard%20Metzenbaum">Howard Metzenbaum</a>, whom he had defeated in a tennis match in, as the nominee put it, "a case of my integrity overcoming my judgment".

Scalia met no opposition from the committee. The full Senate debated Scalia's nomination only briefly, confirming him 98–0 on September 17, 1986 and thereby making him the first Italian-American Justice. That vote followed Rehnquist's confirmation as Chief Justice by a vote of 65–33 on the same day. Scalia took his seat on September 26, 1986. One committee member, Democratic Delaware Senator <a href="Joe%20Biden">Joe Biden</a>, later stated that he regretted not having opposed Scalia "because he was so effective".

It was Scalia's view that clear lines of separation among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches follow directly from the Constitution, with no branch allowed to exercise powers granted to another branch. In his early days on the Court, he authored a powerful—and solitary—dissent in 1988's "<a href="Morrison%20v.%20Olson">Morrison v. Olson</a>", in which the Court's majority upheld the <a href="United%20States%20Office%20of%20the%20Independent%20Counsel">Independent Counsel law</a>. Scalia's thirty-page draft dissent surprised Justice <a href="Harry%20Blackmun">Harry Blackmun</a> for its emotional content; Blackmun felt "it could be cut down to ten pages if Scalia omitted the screaming". Scalia indicated that the law was an unwarranted encroachment on the executive branch by the legislative. He warned, "Frequently an issue of this sort will come before the Court clad, so to speak, in sheep's clothing ... But this wolf comes as a wolf".

The 1989 case of "<a href="Mistretta%20v.%20United%20States">Mistretta v. United States</a>" challenged the <a href="United%20States%20Sentencing%20Commission">United States Sentencing Commission</a>, an independent body within the judicial branch whose members (some of whom were federal judges) were removable only for good cause. The petitioner argued that the arrangement violated separation of powers and that the <a href="United%20States%20Sentencing%20Guidelines">United States Sentencing Guidelines</a> promulgated by the Commission were invalid. Eight justices joined in the majority opinion written by Blackmun, upholding the Guidelines as constitutional. Scalia dissented, stating that the issuance of the Guidelines was a lawmaking function that Congress could not delegate and dubbed the Commission "a sort of junior-varsity Congress".

In 1996, Congress passed the <a href="Line%20Item%20Veto%20Act">Line Item Veto Act</a>, which allowed the president to cancel items from an <a href="appropriations%20bill">appropriations bill</a> (a bill authorizing spending) once passed into law. The statute was challenged the following year. The matter rapidly reached the Supreme Court, which struck down the law as violating the <a href="Presentment%20Clause">Presentment Clause</a> of the Constitution, which governs what the president is permitted to do with a bill once it has passed both houses of Congress. Scalia dissented, seeing no Presentment Clause difficulties and feeling that the act did not violate separation of powers. Scalia indicated he felt that authorizing the president to cancel an appropriation was no different from allowing him to spend an appropriation at his discretion, which had long been accepted as constitutional.

In 2004, in "<a href="Rasul%20v.%20Bush">Rasul v. Bush</a>", the Court held that federal courts had <a href="subject-matter%20jurisdiction">jurisdiction</a> to hear "<a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>" petitions brought by detainees at the <a href="Guantanamo%20Bay%20detainment%20camp">Guantanamo Bay detainment camp</a>. Scalia accused the majority of "spring<nowiki>[ing]</nowiki> a trap on the Executive" by ruling that it could hear cases involving persons at Guantanamo when no federal court had ever ruled that it had the authority to hear cases involving people there.

Scalia (joined by Justice <a href="John%20Paul%20Stevens">John Paul Stevens</a>) also dissented in the 2004 case of "<a href="Hamdi%20v.%20Rumsfeld">Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</a>", involving <a href="Yaser%20Hamdi">Yaser Hamdi</a>, an American citizen detained in the United States on the allegation he was an <a href="enemy%20combatant">enemy combatant</a>. The Court held that although Congress had authorized Hamdi's detention, Fifth Amendment due process guarantees give a citizen held in the United States as an enemy combatant [Hamdi] the right to contest that detention before a neutral decision maker. Scalia wrote that the <a href="Authorization%20for%20Use%20of%20Military%20Force%20Against%20Terrorists">AUMF</a> (Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists) could not be read to suspend "habeas corpus" and that the Court, faced with legislation by Congress that did not grant the president power to detain Hamdi, was trying to "Make Everything Come Out Right".

In March 2006, Scalia gave a talk at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, where he was asked about detainee rights. He responded, "Give me a break ... I had a son on that battlefield and they were shooting at my son, and I'm not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial. I mean it's crazy". Although Scalia was not referring to any particular individual, the Supreme Court was about to consider the case of <a href="Salim%20Ahmed%20Hamdan">Salim Ahmed Hamdan</a>, supposed driver to <a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden">Osama bin Laden</a>, who was challenging the <a href="Guantanamo%20military%20commission">military commissions</a> at Guantanamo Bay. A group of retired military officers that supported Hamdan's position asked Scalia to <a href="recusal">recuse</a> himself, or step aside from hearing the case, which he declined to do. The Court held 5–3 in "<a href="Hamdan%20v.%20Rumsfeld">Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</a>" that the federal courts had jurisdiction to consider Hamdan's claims; Scalia, in dissent, contended that any Court authority to consider Hamdan's petition had been eliminated by the <a href="jurisdiction%20stripping">jurisdiction-stripping</a> <a href="Detainee%20Treatment%20Act">Detainee Treatment Act</a> of 2005.

In <a href="federalism">federalism</a> cases pitting the powers of the federal government against those of the states, Scalia often took the states' positions. In 1997, the Supreme Court considered the case of "<a href="Printz%20v.%20United%20States">Printz v. United States</a>", a challenge to certain provisions of the <a href="Brady%20Handgun%20Violence%20Prevention%20Act">Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act</a>, which required chief law enforcement officers of localities in states to perform certain duties. In "Printz", Scalia wrote the Court's majority decision. The Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional the provision that imposed those duties as violating the <a href="Tenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Tenth Amendment</a>, which reserves to the states and to the people those powers not granted to the federal government. In 2005, Scalia concurred in "<a href="Gonzales%20v.%20Raich">Gonzales v. Raich</a>", which read the <a href="Commerce%20Clause">Commerce Clause</a> to hold that Congress could ban the use of <a href="marijuana">marijuana</a> even when states approve its use for <a href="medical%20marijuana">medicinal purposes</a>. Scalia opined that the Commerce Clause, together with the <a href="Necessary%20and%20Proper%20Clause">Necessary and Proper Clause</a>, permitted the regulation. In addition, Scalia felt that Congress may regulate intrastate activities if doing so is a necessary part of a more general regulation of interstate commerce. He based that decision on "<a href="Wickard%20v.%20Filburn">Wickard v. Filburn</a>", which he now wrote "expanded the Commerce Clause beyond all reason".

Scalia rejected the existence of the <a href="Dormant%20Commerce%20Clause">negative Commerce Clause</a> doctrine, calling it "a judicial fraud".

Scalia took a broad view of the <a href="Eleventh%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Eleventh Amendment</a>, which bars certain lawsuits against states in the federal courts. In his 1989 dissent in "<a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> v. <a href="Union%20Gas">Union Gas</a> Co.", Scalia stated that there was no intent on the part of the framers to have the states surrender any <a href="sovereign%20immunity">sovereign immunity</a> and that the case that provoked the Eleventh Amendment, "<a href="Chisholm%20v.%20Georgia">Chisholm v. Georgia</a>", came as a surprise to them. Professor Ralph Rossum, who wrote a survey of Scalia's constitutional views, suggests that the justice's view of the Eleventh Amendment was actually contradictory to the language of the Amendment.

Scalia argued that there is no constitutional right to abortion and that if the people desire legalized abortion, a law should be passed to accomplish it. Scalia wrote in his dissenting opinion in the 1992 case of "<a href="Planned%20Parenthood%20v.%20Casey">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a>",
Scalia repeatedly called upon his colleagues to strike down "<a href="Roe%20v.%20Wade">Roe v. Wade</a>". Scalia hoped to find five votes to strike down "Roe" in the 1989 case of "<a href="Webster%20v.%20Reproductive%20Health%20Services">Webster v. Reproductive Health Services</a>" but was not successful in doing so. Justice <a href="Sandra%20Day%20O%27Connor">Sandra Day O'Connor</a> authored the decision of the Court, allowing the abortion regulations at issue in the case to stand but not overriding "Roe". Scalia concurred only in part. Scalia wrote, "Justice O'Connor's assertion, that a 'fundamental rule of judicial restraint' requires us to avoid reconsidering "Roe" cannot be taken seriously". He noted, "We can now look forward to at least another Term of carts full of mail from the public, and the streets full of demonstrators".

The Court returned to the issue of abortion in the 2000 case of "<a href="Stenberg%20v.%20Carhart">Stenberg v. Carhart</a>", in which it invalidated a Nebraska statute outlawing <a href="partial-birth%20abortion">partial-birth abortion</a>. Justice <a href="Stephen%20Breyer">Stephen Breyer</a> wrote for the Court that the law was unconstitutional because it did not allow an exception for the health of the woman. Scalia dissented, comparing the "Stenberg" case to two of the most reviled cases in Supreme Court history: "I am optimistic enough to believe that, one day, "Stenberg v. Carhart" will be assigned its rightful place in the history of this Court's jurisprudence beside "<a href="Korematsu%20v.%20United%20States">Korematsu</a>" and "<a href="Dred%20Scott%20v.%20Sandford">Dred Scott</a>". The method of killing a human child ... proscribed by this statute is so horrible that the most clinical description of it evokes a shudder of revulsion".

In 2007, the Court upheld a federal statute banning partial-birth abortion in "<a href="Gonzales%20v.%20Carhart">Gonzales v. Carhart</a>". University of Chicago law professor <a href="Geoffrey%20R.%20Stone">Geoffrey R. Stone</a>, a former colleague of Scalia's, criticized "Gonzales", stating that religion had influenced the outcome because all five justices in the majority were Catholic, whereas the dissenters were Protestant or Jewish. This angered Scalia to such an extent that he stated he would not speak at the University of Chicago as long as Stone was there.

Scalia generally voted to strike down laws that make distinctions by race, gender, or sexual orientation. In 1989, he concurred with the Court's judgment in "<a href="City%20of%20Richmond%20v.%20J.A.%20Croson%20Co.">City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.</a>", in which the Court applied <a href="strict%20scrutiny">strict scrutiny</a> to a city program requiring a certain percentage of contracts to go to minorities, and struck down the program. Scalia did not join the majority opinion, however. He disagreed with O'Connor's opinion, for the Court, that states and localities could institute race-based programs if they identified past discrimination and if the programs were designed to remedy the past racism. Five years later, in "<a href="Adarand%20Constructors%2C%20Inc.%20v.%20Pe%C3%B1a">Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña</a>", he concurred in the Court's judgment and in part with the opinion that extended strict scrutiny to federal programs. Scalia noted in that matter his view that government can never have a compelling interest in making up for past discrimination by racial preferences,

In the 2003 case of "<a href="Grutter%20v.%20Bollinger">Grutter v. Bollinger</a>", involving racial preferences in the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan's</a> law school, Scalia mocked the Court majority's finding that the school was entitled to continue using race as a factor in admissions to promote diversity and to increase "cross-racial understanding". Scalia noted,
Scalia argued that laws that make distinctions between genders should be subjected to <a href="intermediate%20scrutiny">intermediate scrutiny</a>, requiring that the gender classification be substantially related to important government objectives. When, in 1996, the Court upheld a suit brought by a woman who wished to enter the <a href="Virginia%20Military%20Institute">Virginia Military Institute</a> in the case of "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Virginia">United States v. Virginia</a>", Scalia filed a lone, lengthy dissent. Scalia said that the Court, in requiring Virginia to show an "extremely persuasive justification" for the single-sex admission policy, had redefined intermediate scrutiny in such a way "that makes it indistinguishable from strict scrutiny".

In one of the final decisions of the Burger Court, the Court ruled in 1986 in "<a href="Bowers%20v.%20Hardwick">Bowers v. Hardwick</a>" that "homosexual sodomy" was not protected by the <a href="right%20of%20privacy">right of privacy</a> and could be criminally prosecuted by the states. In 1995, however, that ruling was effectively gutted by "<a href="Romer%20v.%20Evans">Romer v. Evans</a>", which struck down a Colorado state constitutional amendment, passed by popular vote, that forbade antidiscrimination laws' being extended to sexual orientation. Scalia dissented from the opinion by Justice Kennedy, believing that "Bowers" had protected the right of the states to pass such measures and that the Colorado amendment was not discriminatory but merely prevented homosexuals from gaining favored status under Colorado law. Scalia later said of "Romer", "And the Supreme Court said, 'Yes, it is unconstitutional.' On the basis of—I don't know, the Sexual Preference Clause of the Bill of Rights, presumably. And the liberals loved it, and the conservatives gnashed their teeth".

In 2003, "Bowers" was formally overruled by "<a href="Lawrence%20v.%20Texas">Lawrence v. Texas</a>", from which Scalia dissented. According to <a href="Mark%20V.%20Tushnet">Mark V. Tushnet</a> in his survey of the Rehnquist Court, during the oral argument in the case, Scalia seemed so intent on making the state's argument for it that the Chief Justice intervened. According to his biographer, <a href="Joan%20Biskupic">Joan Biskupic</a>, Scalia "ridiculed" the majority in his dissent for being so ready to cast aside "Bowers" when many of the same justices had refused to overturn "Roe" in "<a href="Planned%20Parenthood">Planned Parenthood</a> v. Casey". In March 2009, openly gay Congressman <a href="Barney%20Frank">Barney Frank</a> described him as a "homophobe". <a href="Maureen%20Dowd">Maureen Dowd</a> described Scalia in a 2003 column as "<a href="Archie%20Bunker">Archie Bunker</a> in a high-backed chair". In an op-ed for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", federal appeals judge <a href="Richard%20Posner">Richard Posner</a> and <a href="Georgia%20State%20University">Georgia State University</a> law professor Eric Segall described as radical Scalia's positions on homosexuality, reflecting an apparent belief that the religious stances supposedly held by the majority of US citizens should take precedence over the Constitution and characterizing Scalia's "political ideal as verg[ing] on <a href="majoritarian">majoritarian</a> <a href="theocracy">theocracy</a>".

In the 2013 case of "<a href="Hollingsworth%20v.%20Perry">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a>", which involved a California ballot initiative known as <a href="Proposition%208">Proposition 8</a> that amended the California State Constitution to ban same-sex marriage, Scalia voted with the majority to uphold a lower court decision overturning the ban. The decision was based on the appellants lack of standing to appeal and not on the substantive issue of the constitutionality of Proposition 8. 

Also in 2013, Scalia dissented from the majority opinion in "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Windsor">United States v. Windsor</a>". In "Windsor", the Court held that restricting U.S. federal interpretation of "marriage" and "spouse" to apply only to opposite-sex unions, by Section 3 of the <a href="Defense%20of%20Marriage%20Act">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA), is unconstitutional under the <a href="Due%20Process%20Clause">Due Process Clause</a> of the <a href="Fifth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fifth Amendment</a>. Scalia's dissent, which was joined in full by Justice Thomas and in part by Chief Justice Roberts, opened:
Scalia argued that the judgment effectively characterized opponents of same-sex marriage as "enemies of the human race": He argued that the Court's ruling would affect <a href="Same-sex%20marriage%20law%20in%20the%20United%20States%20by%20state">state bans on same-sex marriage</a> as well:
Scalia concluded by saying that the Supreme Court "has cheated both sides, robbing the winners of an honest victory, and the losers of the peace that comes from a fair defeat."

In 2015, Scalia dissented from the majority opinion in "Obergefell v. Hodges", in which the Court ruled that the fundamental right to marry was guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In his dissent, Scalia stated that the Court's decision effectively robs the people of "the freedom to govern themselves", noting that a rigorous debate on same-sex marriage had been taking place and that, by deciding the issue nationwide, the democratic process had been unduly halted. Addressing the claimed <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a> violation, Scalia asserted that, because a same-sex marriage ban would not have been considered unconstitutional at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment's adoption, such bans are not unconstitutional today. He claimed there was "no basis" for the Court's decision striking down legislation that the Fourteenth Amendment does not expressly forbid, and directly attacked the majority opinion for "lacking even a thin veneer of law". Lastly, Scalia faulted the actual writing in the opinion for "diminish[ing] this Court's reputation for clear thinking and sober analysis" and for "descend[ing] from the disciplined legal reasoning of <a href="John%20Marshall">John Marshall</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Story">Joseph Story</a> to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie."

Scalia believed the <a href="capital%20punishment%20in%20the%20United%20States">death penalty</a> to be constitutional. He dissented in decisions that hold the death penalty unconstitutional as applied to certain groups, such as those who were under the age of 18 at the time of offense. In "<a href="Thompson%20v.%20Oklahoma">Thompson v. Oklahoma</a>" (1988), he dissented from the Court's ruling that the death penalty could not be applied to those aged 15 at the time of the offense, and the following year authored the Court's opinion in "<a href="Stanford%20v.%20Kentucky">Stanford v. Kentucky</a>", sustaining the death penalty for those who killed at age 16. However, in 2005, the Court overturned "Stanford" in "<a href="Roper%20v.%20Simmons">Roper v. Simmons</a>", and Scalia again dissented, mocking the majority's claims that a national consensus had emerged against the execution of those who killed while <a href="underage">underage</a>, noting that less than half of the states that permitted the death penalty prohibited it for underage killers. He castigated the majority for including in their count states that had abolished the death penalty entirely, stating that doing so was "rather like including old-order Amishmen in a consumer-preference poll on the electric car. Of course they don't like it, but that sheds no light whatever on the point at issue". In 2002, in "<a href="Atkins%20v.%20Virginia">Atkins v. Virginia</a>", the Court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional as applied to the mentally retarded. Scalia dissented, stating that it would not have been considered cruel or unusual to execute the mildly mentally retarded at the time of the 1791 adoption of the Bill of Rights and that the Court had failed to show that a national consensus had formed against the practice.

Scalia strongly disfavored the Court's ruling in "<a href="Miranda%20v.%20Arizona">Miranda v. Arizona</a>", which held that a confession by an arrested suspect who had not been <a href="Miranda%20warnings">advised of his rights</a> was inadmissible in court, and he voted to overrule "Miranda" in the 2000 case of "<a href="Dickerson%20v.%20United%20States">Dickerson v. United States</a>" but was in a minority of two with Justice <a href="Clarence%20Thomas">Clarence Thomas</a>. Calling the "Miranda" decision a "milestone of judicial overreaching", Scalia stated that the Court should not fear to correct its mistakes.

Although, in many areas, Scalia's approach was unfavorable to criminal defendants, he took the side of defendants in matters involving the <a href="Confrontation%20Clause">Confrontation Clause</a> of the <a href="Sixth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Sixth Amendment</a>, which guarantees defendants the right to confront their accusers. In multiple cases, Scalia wrote against laws that allowed alleged victims of child abuse to testify behind screens or by closed-circuit television. In a 2009 case, Scalia wrote the majority opinion in "<a href="Melendez-Diaz%20v.%20Massachusetts">Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts</a>", holding that defendants must have the opportunity to confront lab technicians in drug cases and that a certificate of analysis is not enough to prove a substance was a drug.

Scalia maintained that every <a href="Element%20%28criminal%20law%29">element</a> of an offense that helps determine the sentence must be either admitted by the defendant or found by a jury under the Sixth Amendment's jury guarantee. In the 2000 case of "<a href="Apprendi%20v.%20New%20Jersey">Apprendi v. New Jersey</a>", Scalia wrote the Court's majority opinion that struck down a state statute that allowed the trial judge to increase the sentence if the judge found the offense was a <a href="hate%20crime">hate crime</a>. Scalia found the procedure impermissible because whether it was a hate crime had not been decided by the jury. In 2004, he wrote for the Court in "<a href="Blakely%20v.%20Washington">Blakely v. Washington</a>", striking down Washington state's sentencing guidelines on similar grounds. The dissenters in "Blakely" foresaw that Scalia would use the case to attack the federal sentencing guidelines (which he had failed to strike down in "Mistretta"), and they proved correct, as Scalia led a five-member majority in "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Booker">United States v. Booker</a>", which made those guidelines no longer mandatory for federal judges to follow (they remained advisory).

In the 2001 case of "<a href="Kyllo%20v.%20United%20States">Kyllo v. United States</a>", Scalia wrote the Court's opinion in a 5–4 decision that cut across ideological lines. That decision found thermal imaging of a home to be an unreasonable search under the <a href="Fourth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourth Amendment</a>. The Court struck down a conviction for marijuana manufacture based on a search warrant issued after such scans were conducted, which showed that the garage was considerably hotter than the rest of the house because of indoor growing lights. Applying that Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure to arrest, Scalia dissented from the Court's 1991 decision in "<a href="County%20of%20Riverside%20v.%20McLaughlin">County of Riverside v. McLaughlin</a>", allowing a 48-hour delay before a person arrested without a warrant is taken before a magistrate, on the ground that at the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, an arrested person was to be taken before a magistrate as quickly as practicable. In a 1990 <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a> case, "<a href="R.A.V.%20v.%20St.%20Paul">R.A.V. v. St. Paul</a>", Scalia wrote the Court's opinion striking down a <a href="St.%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">St. Paul, Minnesota</a>, <a href="hate%20speech">hate speech</a> ordinance in a prosecution for burning a cross. Scalia noted, "Let there be no mistake about our belief that burning a cross in someone's front yard is reprehensible. But St. Paul has sufficient means at its disposal to prevent such behavior without adding the First Amendment to the fire".

In 2008, the Court considered a challenge to the gun laws in the <a href="District%20of%20Columbia">District of Columbia</a>. Scalia wrote the majority opinion in "<a href="District%20of%20Columbia%20v.%20Heller">District of Columbia v. Heller</a>", which found an individual right to own a firearm under the <a href="Second%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Second Amendment</a>. Scalia traced the word "militia", found in the Second Amendment, as it would have been understood at the time of its ratification, stating that it then meant "the body of all citizens". The Court upheld Heller's claim to own a firearm in the District.

Scalia's opinion for the "Heller" Court was criticized by liberals and applauded by conservatives. Seventh Circuit Judge <a href="Richard%20Posner">Richard Posner</a> disagreed with Scalia's opinion, stating that the Second Amendment "creates no right to the private possession of guns". Posner called Scalia's opinion "faux originalism" and a "historicizing glaze on personal values and policy preferences". In October 2008, Scalia stated that the court's originalists needed to show only that at the time the Second Amendment was ratified, the right to bear arms did not have an exclusively military context and that they were successful in so showing.

Following the death of Scalia, Paul Barrett, writing for Bloomberg Businessweek, reported that: "Translating into liberal argot: Scalia changed the rules for who could sue". The issue elevated the recognition of Scalia as a notable influence on establishing and determining the conditions under which cases could be brought to trial and for litigation—and by whom such litigation could take place. David Rivkin, from the conservative standpoint, said, "He (Scalia) did more to clarify and limit the bounds and scope of judicial power than any Supreme Court Justice in history, particularly in the area of standing and class actions". Scalia indicated his long-held position from the time of his 1983 law review article titled "The Doctrine of Standing as an Essential Element of the Separation of Powers". As summarized by Barrett, "He (Scalia) wrote that courts had misappropriated authority from other branches of government by allowing too many people to sue corporations and government agencies, especially in environmental cases". In a practical sense, Scalia brought to the attention of the Court the authority to restrict "standing" in class action suits in which the litigants may be defined in descriptive terms rather than as well-defined and unambiguous litigants.

Scalia concurred in the 1990 case of "<a href="Cruzan%20v.%20Director%2C%20Missouri%20Department%20of%20Health">Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health</a>", in which the family of <a href="Nancy%20Cruzan">a woman</a> in a <a href="vegetative%20state">vegetative state</a> sought to have her feeding tube removed so she would die, believing that to have been her wish. The Court found for the State of Missouri, requiring <a href="clear%20and%20convincing%20evidence">clear and convincing evidence</a> of such a desire. Scalia stated that the Court should have remained away from the dispute and that the issues "are <nowiki>[not]</nowiki> better known to the nine Justices of this Court any better than they are known to nine people picked at random from the Kansas City telephone directory".

Scalia joined the majority "<a href="per%20curiam">per curiam</a>" opinion in the 2000 case of "<a href="Bush%20v.%20Gore">Bush v. Gore</a>", which effectively ended recounts of ballots in Florida following the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202000">2000 US Presidential election</a>, and also both concurred separately and joined Rehnquist's concurrence. In 2007, he said of the case, "I and my court owe no apology whatever for "Bush v. Gore". We did the right thing. So there! ... get over it. It's so old by now". During an interview on the <a href="Charlie%20Rose%20%28talk%20show%29">"Charlie Rose" show</a>, he defended the Court's action:

During oral argument before the Court, Scalia asked more questions and made more comments than any other justice—and a 2005 study found that he provoked laughter more often than any of his colleagues did. His goal during oral arguments was to get across his position to the other justices.
<a href="University%20of%20Kansas">University of Kansas</a> social psychologist Lawrence Wrightsman wrote of the justice, "he communicates a sense of urgency on the bench, and his style is forever forceful". After Chief Justice <a href="John%20Roberts">John Roberts</a> joined the Court in 2005, he took to quizzing lawyers in a manner similar to Scalia's, and sometimes the two questioned counsel in seeming coordination. <a href="Dahlia%20Lithwick">Dahlia Lithwick</a> of "<a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">Slate</a>" described Scalia's technique:
Scalia wrote numerous opinions from the start of his career on the Supreme Court. During his tenure, he wrote more <a href="concurring%20opinion">concurring opinion</a>s than any other justice, and only two justices have written more <a href="dissenting%20opinion">dissents</a>. According to Kevin Ring, who compiled a book of Scalia's dissenting and concurring opinions: "His opinions are ... highly readable. His entertaining writing style can make even the most mundane areas of the law interesting". Conor Clarke of "Slate" comments on Scalia's written opinions, especially his dissents:

At the Supreme Court, justices meet after the case is briefed and argued, and they vote on the result. The task of writing the opinion is assigned by the Chief Justice or, if the Chief Justice is in the minority or not participating, by the senior justice in the majority. After the assignment, the justices generally communicate about a case by sending notes and draft opinions to one other's chambers. In the give-and-take of opinion writing, Scalia did not compromise his views in order to attract five votes for a majority (unlike the late Justice <a href="William%20J.%20Brennan%2C%20Jr.">William J. Brennan, Jr.</a>, who would accept fewer than he wanted in order to gain a partial victory). Scalia, known to his friends and colleagues as "Nino", attempted to influence his colleagues by sending them "Ninograms"—short memorandums aimed at trying to get them to include his views in their opinions.

In an October 2013 issue of "New York" magazine, Scalia revealed that he scanned "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" and "<a href="The%20Washington%20Times">The Washington Times</a>," got most of his news from talk radio, and did not read "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" or "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>." The latter he described as ""shrilly" liberal".

Scalia was a <a href="textualism">textualist</a> in <a href="statutory%20interpretation">statutory interpretation</a>, believing that the ordinary meaning of a statute should govern.
In 1998, Scalia vociferously opposed the idea of a <a href="living%20constitution">living constitution</a>, or the power of the judiciary to modify the meaning of constitutional provisions to adapt them to changing times. Scalia warned that if one accepted that constitutional standards should evolve with a maturing society, "the risk of assessing evolving standards is that it is all too easy to believe that evolution has culminated in one's own views". He compared the Constitution to statutes he contended were not understood to change their meaning through time.
Constitutional amendments, such as the 1868 <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, according to Scalia, were to be interpreted based on their meaning at the time of ratification. Scalia was often asked how that approach justified the result in the 1954 case of "<a href="Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a>", which held that segregated schools were unconstitutional and which relied on the Fourteenth Amendment for the result.

In interpreting statutes, Scalia did not look to <a href="legislative%20history">legislative history</a>. In the 2006 case of "<a href="Zedner%20v.%20United%20States">Zedner v. United States</a>", he joined the majority opinion written by Justice <a href="Samuel%20Alito">Samuel Alito</a>—all except one paragraph of the opinion, in which Alito cited legislative history. In a concurring opinion in that case, Scalia noted, "The use of legislative history is illegitimate and ill advised in the interpretation of any statute".
His dislike of legislative history may have been a reason that other justices have become more cautious in its use. Gregory Maggs wrote in the "Public Interest Law Review" in 1995 that by the early 1990s, legislative history was being cited in only about forty percent of Supreme Court cases involving the interpretation of <a href="statute">statute</a>s and that no case of that era used legislative history as an essential reason for the outcome. Maggs suggested,

Scalia described himself as an <a href="originalism">originalist</a>, meaning that he interpreted the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a> as it would have been understood when it was adopted. According to Scalia in 2008, "It's what did the words mean to the people who ratified the Bill of Rights or who ratified the Constitution".
In 2006, before <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> appointees <a href="John%20Roberts">Roberts</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Alito">Alito</a> had had time to make an impact, Rossum wrote that Scalia had failed to win converts among his conservative colleagues for his use of <a href="originalism">originalism</a>, whereas Roberts and Alito, as younger men with an originalist approach, greatly admired Scalia battling for what he believed in. Following the appointments of Roberts and Alito, both Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are identified in their judicial temperament as being originalists with Kavanuagh referred to as "a stalwart originalist" in the tradition of Scalia.

In a 2009 public conversation, Justice <a href="Stephen%20Breyer">Stephen Breyer</a> questioned Scalia, indicating that those who ratified the Fourteenth Amendment did not intend to end school segregation. Scalia called this argument "<a href="waving%20the%20bloody%20shirt">waving the bloody shirt</a> of "Brown"" and indicated that he would have joined <a href="John%20Marshall%20Harlan">first Justice Harlan's</a> solitary dissent in "<a href="Plessy%20v.%20Ferguson">Plessy v. Ferguson</a>", the 1896 case that "Brown" overruled.

Scalia's originalist approach came under attack from critics, who viewed it as "a cover for what they see as Scalia's real intention: to turn back some pivotal court decisions of the 1960s and 70s" reached by the <a href="Warren%20Court">Warren</a> and Burger Courts. <a href="Ralph%20Nader">Ralph Nader</a> argued in 2008 that Scalia's originalist philosophy was inconsistent with the justice's acceptance of the <a href="Corporate%20personhood%20debate">extension of certain constitutional rights to corporations</a> when at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment's ratification, corporations were not commonly understood to possess constitutional rights. Nader's view preceded the Court's 2010 decision in "<a href="Citizens%20United%20v.%20Federal%20Election%20Commission">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a>". Scalia, in his concurrence in that case, traced his understanding of the rights of groups of individuals at the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights. His argument was based on the lack of an exception for groups such as corporations in the free speech guarantee in the Bill of Rights and on several examples of corporate political speech from the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights. Professor Thomas Colby of <a href="George%20Washington%20University%20National%20Law%20Center">George Washington University National Law Center</a> argued that Scalia's votes in <a href="Establishment%20Clause">Establishment Clause</a> cases do not stem from originalist views but simply from conservative political convictions. Scalia responded to his critics that his originalism "has occasionally led him to decisions he deplores, like his upholding the constitutionality of <a href="flag%20burning">flag burning</a>", which according to Scalia was protected by the First Amendment.
In 2009, after nearly a quarter century on the Court, Scalia characterized his victories as "damn few".

Writing in "<a href="The%20Jewish%20Daily%20Forward">The Jewish Daily Forward</a>" in 2009, J.J. Goldberg described Scalia as "the intellectual anchor of the court's conservative majority". Scalia traveled to the nation's law schools, giving talks on law and democracy. His appearances on college campuses were often <a href="standing%20room%20only">standing room only</a>. Ginsburg indicated that Scalia was "very much in tune with the current generation of law students ... Students now put '<a href="Federalist%20Society">Federalist Society</a>' on their resumes". <a href="John%20Paul%20Stevens">John Paul Stevens</a>, who served throughout Scalia's tenure until his 2010 retirement, said of Scalia's influence, "He's made a huge difference. Some of it constructive, some of it unfortunate". Of the nine sitting justices, Scalia was most often the subject of <a href="law%20review">law review</a> articles.

Scalia <a href="recusal">recused</a> himself from "<a href="Elk%20Grove%20Unified%20School%20District%20v.%20Newdow">Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow</a>" (2004), a claim brought by atheist <a href="Michael%20Newdow">Michael Newdow</a> alleging that recitation of the <a href="Pledge%20of%20Allegiance%20%28United%20States%29">Pledge of Allegiance</a> (including the words "under God") in school classrooms violated the rights of his daughter, who he said was also an atheist. Shortly after the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Ninth%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> ruled in Newdow's favor but before the case came before the Supreme Court, Scalia spoke at a <a href="Knights%20of%20Columbus">Knights of Columbus</a> event in <a href="Fredericksburg%2C%20Virginia">Fredericksburg, Virginia</a>, stating that the Ninth Circuit decision was an example of how the courts were trying to excise God from public life. The school district requested that the Supreme Court review the case, and Newdow asked that Scalia recuse himself because of this prior statement, which he did without comment.

Scalia declined to recuse himself from "<a href="Cheney%20v.%20United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia">Cheney v. United States District Court for the District of Columbia</a>" (2005), a case concerning whether Vice President <a href="Dick%20Cheney">Dick Cheney</a> could keep secret the membership of an advisory task force on energy policy. Scalia was asked to recuse himself because he had gone on a hunting trip with various persons including Cheney, during which he traveled one way on <a href="Air%20Force%20Two">Air Force Two</a>. Scalia issued a lengthy <a href="in-chambers%20opinion">in-chambers opinion</a> refusing to recuse himself, stating that though Cheney was a longtime friend, he was being sued merely in his official capacity and that were justices to step aside in the cases of officials who are parties because of official capacity, the Supreme Court would cease to function. Scalia indicated that it was far from unusual for justices to socialize with other government officials, recalling that the late Chief Justice <a href="Fred%20M.%20Vinson">Fred M. Vinson</a> played poker with President <a href="Harry%20Truman">Harry Truman</a> and that Justice <a href="Byron%20White">Byron White</a> went skiing with Attorney General <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy">Robert F. Kennedy</a>. Scalia stated that he was never alone with Cheney during the trip, the two had not discussed the case, and the justice had saved no money because he had bought round-trip tickets, the cheapest available. Scalia was part of the 7–2 majority once the case was heard, which generally upheld Cheney's position. Scalia later described his refusal to recuse himself as his "most heroic opinion" because it had exposed him to a great deal of criticism.

Scalia was a devout <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, and his son Paul entered the priesthood. Uncomfortable with the changes brought about following <a href="Vatican%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Vatican II</a>, Scalia drove long distances to parishes he felt were more in accord with his beliefs, including parishes that celebrated the <a href="Tridentine%20Latin%20Mass">Tridentine Latin Mass</a> in Chicago and Washington, and one celebrating the Latin version of the <a href="Mass%20of%20Paul%20VI">Mass of Paul VI</a> at St. Catherine of Siena in <a href="Great%20Falls%2C%20Virginia">Great Falls, Virginia</a>. In a 2013 interview with Jennifer Senior for "New York" magazine, Scalia was asked whether his beliefs extended to the Devil, and he stated, "Of course! Yeah, he's a real person. Hey, c'mon, that's standard Catholic doctrine! Every Catholic believes that". When asked whether he had seen recent evidence of the Devil, Scalia replied: "You know, it is curious. In the Gospels, the Devil is doing all sorts of things. He's making pigs run off cliffs, he's possessing people and whatnot ... What he's doing now is getting people not to believe in him or in God. He's much more successful that way". In another 2013 interview, Scalia said, "In order for capitalism to work, in order for it to produce a good and stable society, traditional Christian virtues are essential".

In 2006, upon leaving church, Scalia was asked by a reporter whether being a traditionalist Catholic had caused problems for him, and he responded by asking, "You know what I say to those people?" and with a gesture, cupping his hand under his chin and flicking his fingers out. The gesture, which got captured by a photographer, was initially reported by the "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>" as obscene. Scalia responded to the reports with a letter to the editor, accusing the news staff of watching too many episodes of "<a href="The%20Sopranos">The Sopranos</a>" and stating that the gesture was a strong brush-off. Roger Axtell, an expert on body language, described the gesture as possibly meaning "I've had enough, go away" and noted, "It's a fairly strong gesture". The gesture was parodied by comedian <a href="Stephen%20Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> during <a href="Stephen%20Colbert%20at%20the%202006%20White%20House%20Correspondents%27%20Association%20Dinner">his performance at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner</a> later that year, with the justice in attendance: cameras showed that unlike most of the butts of Colbert's jokes that evening, Scalia was laughing.

According to <a href="John%20Boehner">John Boehner</a>, as chairman of the <a href="Republican%20Conference%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House Republican Conference</a>, he sought to persuade Scalia to run for election as vice president with <a href="Bob%20Dole">Bob Dole</a> in 1996. As related by Boehner, Scalia listened to the proposal and dictated the same reply Justice <a href="Charles%20Evans%20Hughes">Charles Evans Hughes</a> had once given to a similar query: "The possibility is too remote to comment upon, given my position". Dole did put Scalia on his list of potential running mates but eventually settled on <a href="Jack%20Kemp">Jack Kemp</a>.

On September 10, 1960, Scalia married Maureen McCarthy at St. Pius X church in <a href="Yarmouth%2C%20Massachusetts">Yarmouth, Massachusetts</a>. The two had met on a blind date while he was at Harvard Law School. Maureen was an undergraduate student at <a href="Radcliffe%20College">Radcliffe College</a> when they met; she subsequently obtained a degree in English from the school.

The couple raised nine children, five boys and four girls. Two of the sons, <a href="Eugene%20Scalia">Eugene Scalia</a> and John Scalia, are attorneys. Paul Scalia is a Catholic priest, Matthew had a career in the army, and Christopher is a writer. All four daughters, Catherine, Ann, Margaret, and Mary, have families. According to Scalia, Maureen raised all nine children "with very little assistance from me". The family resided in <a href="McLean%2C%20Virginia">McLean, Virginia</a>, a suburb of Washington, D.C.

Scalia enjoyed a warm relationship with fellow Justice <a href="Ruth%20Bader%20Ginsburg">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a>, considered a member of the court's liberal wing, with the two attending the opera together and appearing together onstage as <a href="Supernumerary%20actor">supernumeraries</a> in <a href="Washington%20National%20Opera">Washington National Opera's</a> 1994 production of "<a href="Ariadne%20auf%20Naxos">Ariadne auf Naxos</a>". Ginsburg was a colleague of Scalia on the D.C. Circuit, and the Scalias and Ginsburgs had dinner together every New Year's Eve.

Scalia died in his sleep at age 79. His body was discovered on the morning of February 13, 2016 in his room at <a href="Cibolo%20Creek%20Ranch">Cibolo Creek Ranch</a> in <a href="Shafter%2C%20Texas">Shafter, Texas</a>. He had gone <a href="quail">quail</a> hunting the afternoon before, and then dined. The justice was pronounced dead of apparent <a href="Death%20by%20natural%20causes">natural causes</a>. His physician, Rear Admiral <a href="Brian%20Monahan">Brian P. Monahan</a>, said Scalia had a history of heart trouble, including high blood pressure, and had recently been deemed too weak to undergo surgery for a torn <a href="rotator%20cuff">rotator cuff</a>.

For the month following Scalia's death, his chair in the Supreme Court chamber and the front of the bench where he sat were draped with black wool <a href="Cr%C3%AApe%20%28textile%29">crêpe</a>, with more over the court's entrance, a tradition dating from the death of Chief Justice <a href="Salmon%20P.%20Chase">Salmon P. Chase</a> in 1873. Flags on the Court's front plaza were flown at <a href="Half%20mast">half-staff</a> for 30 days. Scalia's body <a href="lying%20in%20repose">lay in repose</a> in the Great Hall of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> on February 19, 2016. His son, Father Paul Scalia, celebrated a Catholic <a href="Requiem">funeral Mass</a> and delivered the homily the next day at the <a href="Basilica%20of%20the%20National%20Shrine%20of%20the%20Immaculate%20Conception">Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception</a> in Washington, D.C. The interment was private, at <a href="Fairfax%20Memorial%20Park">Fairfax Memorial Park</a> in <a href="Fairfax%2C%20Virginia">Fairfax, Virginia</a>.

On May 17, 2016, <a href="George%20Mason%20University">George Mason University</a> School of Law in <a href="Arlington%2C%20Virginia">Arlington, Virginia</a> was officially renamed <a href="Antonin%20Scalia%20Law%20School">Antonin Scalia Law School</a> in Scalia's memory. The dedication ceremony occurred on October 6 and was attended by Supreme Court justices. At the ceremony, Justice <a href="Elena%20Kagan">Elena Kagan</a> called Scalia "one of the most important Supreme Court justices ever, and also one of the greatest".

In October 2016, the <a href="Italy%E2%80%93USA%20Foundation">Italy–USA Foundation</a> posthumously awarded Scalia its America Award. The ceremony was conducted in front of the Italian parliament in Rome.

John Strand's play "<a href="The%20Originalist">The Originalist</a>" aired on <a href="PBS">PBS</a> on March 13, 2017, with a positive review from "The New York Times". The play depicted Justice Scalia's interaction with a liberal court clerk and their mutual criticism and eventual support of each other. The play had a cross-country tour from Washington, D.C. to the <a href="Pasadena%20Playhouse">Pasadena Playhouse</a>.

In 2018, President <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> posthumously awarded the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> to Scalia.

Scalia's death—only the second death of a serving justice in a span of sixty years—left eight justices remaining on the Supreme Court, split 4–4 between fairly conservative and fairly liberal, during a <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202016">presidential election year</a>. Cases that were pending before the Court at Scalia's death were decided by the remaining eight members. A 4–4 deadlock would result in the ruling of the lower court being upheld, but no precedent being set, and the justices would not publish written opinions on the merits of the case.

In a 2012 interview, Scalia had said he would prefer Judge <a href="Frank%20H.%20Easterbrook">Frank H. Easterbrook</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Seventh%20Circuit">Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals</a> as his successor. On March 16, 2016, President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>, a Democrat, nominated <a href="Merrick%20Garland">Merrick Garland</a>, Chief Judge of the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a>, to fill Scalia's seat, but the Republican-controlled Senate declined to take any action on the nomination; the nomination expired with the end of the <a href="114th%20Congress">114th Congress</a> on January 3, 2017. On January 31, 2017, Republican President <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> announced the nomination of Judge <a href="Neil%20Gorsuch">Neil Gorsuch</a> of the <a href="Tenth%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> to succeed Scalia. Gorsuch was confirmed by the Senate on April 7, 2017.

George Lansbury

George Lansbury (22 February 1859 – 7 May 1940) was a British politician and <a href="reform%20movement">social reformer</a> who led the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> from 1932 to 1935. Apart from a brief period of ministerial office during the <a href="Second%20MacDonald%20ministry">Labour government of 1929–31</a>, he spent his political life campaigning against established authority and vested interests, his main causes being the promotion of <a href="social%20justice">social justice</a>, <a href="women%27s%20rights">women's rights</a> and world disarmament. Originally a <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">radical Liberal</a>, Lansbury became a socialist in the early 1890s, and thereafter served his local community in the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End of London</a> in numerous elective offices. His activities were underpinned by his Christian beliefs which, except for a short period of doubt, sustained him through his life. Elected to <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> in 1910, he resigned his seat in 1912 to campaign for women's suffrage, and was briefly imprisoned after publicly supporting militant action.

In 1912, Lansbury helped to establish the "<a href="Daily%20Herald%20%28UK%20newspaper%29">Daily Herald</a>" newspaper, and became its editor. Throughout the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> the paper maintained a strongly pacifist stance, and supported the October 1917 <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>. These positions contributed to Lansbury's failure to be elected to parliament in 1918. He devoted himself to local politics in his home borough of <a href="Poplar%2C%20London">Poplar</a>, and went to prison with 30 fellow-councillors for his part in the <a href="Poplar%20Rates%20Rebellion">Poplar "rates revolt"</a> of 1921.

After his return to Parliament in 1922, Lansbury was denied office in the brief <a href="First%20MacDonald%20ministry">Labour government of 1924</a>, although he served as <a href="First%20Commissioner%20of%20Works">First Commissioner of Works</a> in the <a href="Second%20MacDonald%20ministry">Labour government of 1929–31</a>. After the political and economic crisis of August 1931, Lansbury did not follow his leader, <a href="Ramsay%20MacDonald">Ramsay MacDonald</a>, into the <a href="First%20National%20Ministry">National Government</a>, but remained with the Labour Party. As the most senior of the small contingent of Labour MPs that survived the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201931">1931 general election</a>, Lansbury became the Leader of the Labour Party. His <a href="pacifism">pacifism</a> and his opposition to rearmament in the face of rising European <a href="Fascism%20in%20Europe">fascism</a> put him at odds with his party, and when his position was rejected at the 1935 Labour Party conference, he resigned the leadership. He spent his final years travelling through the United States and Europe in the cause of peace and disarmament.

George Lansbury was born in <a href="Halesworth">Halesworth</a> in the county of <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a> on 22 February 1859. He was the third of nine children born to a railway worker, also named George Lansbury, and Anne Lansbury (née Ferris). George senior's job involved the supervision of railway construction gangs; the family was often on the move, and living conditions were primitive. Through his progressive-minded mother and grandmother, young George became familiar with the names of great contemporary reformers—<a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">Gladstone</a>, <a href="Richard%20Cobden">Richard Cobden</a> and <a href="John%20Bright">John Bright</a>—and began to read the radical "<a href="Reynolds%20News">Reynolds's Newspaper</a>". By the end of 1868, the family had moved into London's East End, the district in which Lansbury would live and work for almost all his life.

The essayist <a href="Ronald%20Blythe">Ronald Blythe</a> has described the East End of the 1860s and 1870s as "stridently English ... The smoke-blackened streets were packed with illiterate multitudes [who] stayed alive through sheer birdlike ebullience". Interspersed with spells of work, Lansbury attended schools in <a href="Bethnal%20Green">Bethnal Green</a> and <a href="Whitechapel">Whitechapel</a>. He then held a succession of manual jobs, including work as a coaling contractor in partnership with his elder brother, James, loading and unloading coal wagons. This was heavy and dangerous work, and led to at least one near-fatal accident. During his adolescence and early adulthood, Lansbury was a regular attender at the public gallery at the House of Commons, where he heard and remembered many of Gladstone's speeches on the main foreign policy issue of the day, the "<a href="Eastern%20Question">Eastern Question</a>". He was present at the riots which erupted outside Gladstone's house on 24 February 1878 after a peace meeting in <a href="Hyde%20Park%20%28London%29">Hyde Park</a>. Shepherd writes that Gladstone's Liberalism, proclaiming liberty, freedom and community interests was "a heady mix that left an indelible mark" on the youthful Lansbury.

George Lansbury senior died in 1875. That year young George met fourteen-year-old Elizabeth Brine, whose father Isaac Brine owned a local sawmill. The couple eventually married in 1880, at Whitechapel parish church, where the vicar, J. Franklin Kitto, had been Lansbury's spiritual guide and counsellor. Apart from a period of doubt in the 1890s when he temporarily rejected the Church, Lansbury remained a staunch <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> until his death.

In 1881, the first of Lansbury's twelve children, Bessie, was born; another daughter, Annie, followed in 1882. Seeking to improve his family's prospects, Lansbury decided that their best hopes of prosperity lay in emigrating to Australia. The London agent-general for <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> depicted a land of boundless opportunities, with work for all; seduced by this appeal, Lansbury and Bessie raised the necessary passage money, and in May 1884 set sail with their children for <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>.

On the outward passage, the family experienced illness, discomfort and danger; on one occasion the ship came close to foundering during a <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a>. On arrival at Brisbane in July 1884, Lansbury found that contrary to the London agent's promises, there was a superfluity of labour and work was hard to come by. His first job, breaking stone, proved to be too physically punishing; he moved to a better-paid position as a van driver, but was sacked when, for religious reasons, he refused to work on Sundays. He then contracted to work on a farm some 80 miles inland, to find upon arrival that his employer had misled him about living conditions and terms of employment. For several months, the Lansbury family lived in extreme squalor before Lansbury secured release from the contract. Back in Brisbane, he worked for a while at the newly built Brisbane cricket ground. As a keen follower of the game he hoped to see the <a href="History%20of%20Test%20cricket%20from%201884%20to%201889%23Lillywhite%2C%20Shaw%20and%20Shrewsbury%27s%20second%20tour%201884/5">visiting English touring team</a> play but, as Lansbury's biographer <a href="Raymond%20Postgate">Raymond Postgate</a> records, "he learned that cricket watching was not a pleasure for workmen".

Throughout his tenure in Australia, Lansbury sent letters home, revealing the truth about conditions facing immigrants. To a friend he wrote in March 1885: "Mechanics are "not" wanted. Farm labourers are "not" wanted ... Hundreds of men and women are not able to get work ... The streets are foul day and night, and if I had a sister I would "shoot her dead" rather than see her brought out to this little hell on earth". In May 1885, having received from Isaac Brine sufficient funds for a passage home, the Lansbury family left Australia for good.

On his return to London, Lansbury took a job in Brine's timber business. In his spare time he campaigned against the false prospectuses offered by colonial emigration agents. His speech at an emigration conference at <a href="King%27s%20College%20London">King's College</a> in London in April 1886 impressed delegates; shortly afterwards, the government established an Emigration Information Bureau under the <a href="Colonial%20Office">Colonial Office</a>. This body was required to provide accurate information on the state of labour markets in all the government's overseas possessions.

Having joined the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a> shortly after his return from Australia, Lansbury became first a ward secretary and then general secretary for the Bow and Bromley Liberal and Radical Association. His effective campaigning skills had been noted by leading Liberals, including <a href="Samuel%20Montagu%2C%201st%20Baron%20Swaythling">Samuel Montagu</a>, the Liberal <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MP</a> for <a href="Whitechapel%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Whitechapel</a>, who persuaded the young activist to be his agent in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201885">1885 general election</a>. Lansbury's handling of this election campaign prompted Montagu to urge him to stand for parliament himself. Lansbury declined this, partly on practical grounds (MPs were then unpaid and he had to provide for his family), and partly on principle; he was becoming increasingly convinced that his future lay not as a radical Liberal but as a <a href="Socialism">socialist</a>. He continued to serve the Liberals, as an agent and local secretary, while expressing his socialism in a short-lived monthly radical journal, "Coming Times", which he founded and co-edited with a fellow-dissident, William Hoffman.

In 1888 Lansbury agreed to act as election agent for <a href="Jane%20Cobden">Jane Cobden</a>, who was contesting the first elections for the newly formed <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a> (LCC) as Liberal candidate for the Bow and Bromley division. Cobden, an early supporter of women's suffrage, was the fourth child of the Victorian radical statesman <a href="Richard%20Cobden">Richard Cobden</a>. The Society for Promoting Women as County Councillors (SPWCC), a new women's rights group, had proposed Cobden as the candidate for Bow and Bromley and <a href="Margaret%20Sandhurst">Margaret Sandhurst</a> for Brixton. Lansbury counselled Cobden in the issues of greatest concern to the East End electorate: housing for the poor, ending of <a href="sweatshop">sweated labour</a>, rights of public assembly, and control of the police. Specific questions of women's rights were largely avoided during the campaign. On 19 January 1889 both women were elected; these triumphs were, however, short-lived. Sandhurst's qualification to serve as a county councillor was successfully challenged in the courts by her <a href="Conservative%20party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> opponents on the grounds of her sex, and her subsequent appeal was dismissed. Cobden was not immediately challenged, but in April 1891, after a series of legal actions, she was effectively neutered as a councillor by being prevented from voting on pain of severe financial penalties. Lansbury urged her, during the hearings, to "go to prison and let the Council back you up by refusing to declare your seat vacant". Cobden did not follow this path. A Bill introduced in the House of Commons in May 1891 permitting women to serve as county councillors found little support among MPs of any party; women were not granted this right until 1907.

Lansbury was offended by his party's lukewarm support for women's rights. In a letter published in the "<a href="Pall%20Mall%20Gazette">Pall Mall Gazette</a>" he made an open call to Bow and Bromley's Liberals to "shake themselves free of party feeling and throw the energy and ability they are now wasting on minor questions into ... securing the full rights of citizenship to every woman in the land". He was further disillusioned by his party's failure to endorse the eight-hour maximum working day. Lansbury had formed the view, expressed some years later, that "Liberalism would progress just as far as the great money bags of capitalism would allow it to progress". By 1892 the Liberals no longer felt like Lansbury's political home; most of his current associates were avowed socialists: <a href="William%20Morris">William Morris</a>, <a href="Eleanor%20Marx">Eleanor Marx</a>, <a href="John%20Burns">John Burns</a> and <a href="Henry%20Mayers%20Hyndman">Henry Mayers Hyndman</a>, founder of the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Federation">Social Democratic Federation</a> (SDF). Nevertheless, Lansbury did not resign from the Liberals until he had fulfilled a commitment to act as election agent for <a href="John%20Macdonald%20%28British%20politician%29">John Murray MacDonald</a>, the prospective Liberal candidate for Bow and Bromley. He saw his candidate victorious in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201892">July 1892 General Election</a>; as soon as the result was declared, Lansbury resigned from the Liberal Party and joined the SDF.

Lansbury's choice of the SDF, from several socialist organisations, reflected his admiration for Hyndman, whom he considered "one of the truly great ones". Lansbury quickly became the federation's most tireless propagandist, travelling throughout Britain to address meetings or to demonstrate solidarity with workers involved in industrial disputes. Around this time, Lansbury temporarily set aside his Christian beliefs and became a member of the East London <a href="Ethical%20Society">Ethical Society</a>. One factor in his disillusion with the Church was the local clergy's unsympathetic approach to poor relief, and their opposition to collective political action.

In 1895 Lansbury fought two parliamentary elections for the SDF in <a href="Newington%20Walworth%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Walworth</a>, first a by-election on 14 May, then the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201895">1895 general election</a> two months later. Despite his energetic campaigning he was heavily defeated on each occasion, with tiny proportions of the vote. After these dismal results, Lansbury was persuaded by Hyndman to give up his job at the sawmill and become the SDF's full-time salaried national organiser. He preached a straightforward revolutionary doctrine: "The time has arrived", he informed an audience at <a href="Todmorden">Todmorden</a> in Lancashire, "for the working classes to seize political power and use it to overthrow the competitive system and establish in its place state cooperation". Lansbury's time as SDF national organiser did not last long; in 1896, when Isaac Brine died suddenly, Lansbury thought that his family duty required him to take charge of the sawmill, and he returned home to Bow.

In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201900">general election of 1900</a> a pact with the Liberals in the Bow and Bromley constituency gave Lansbury, the SDF candidate, a straight fight against the Conservative incumbent, William Guthrie. Lansbury's cause was hindered by his public opposition to the <a href="Boer%20War%23Second%20Anglo-Boer%20War">Boer War</a> at a time when war fever was strong, while Guthrie, a former soldier, stressed his military credentials. Lansbury lost the election, though his total of 2,258 votes against Guthrie's 4,403 was considered creditable by the press. This campaign was Lansbury's last major effort on behalf of the SDF. He became disenchanted by Hyndman's inability to work with other socialist groups, and in about 1903 resigned from the SDF to join the <a href="Independent%20Labour%20Party">Independent Labour Party</a> (ILP). At around this time, Lansbury rediscovered his Christian faith and rejoined the Anglican Church.

In April 1893 Lansbury achieved his first elective office when he became a <a href="Board%20of%20guardians">Poor Law guardian</a> for the district of <a href="Poplar%2C%20London">Poplar</a>. In place of the traditionally harsh <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a> regime that was the norm, Lansbury proposed a programme of reform, whereby the workhouse became "an agency of help instead of a place of despair", and the stigma of poverty was removed. Lansbury was one of a minority socialist bloc which was often able, through its energy and commitment, to win support for its plans.

Education for the poor was one of Lansbury's major concerns. He helped to transform the Forest Gate District School, previously a punitive establishment run on quasi-military lines, into a proper place of education that became the Poplar Training School, and was still in existence more than half a century later. At the 1897 annual Poor Law Conference Lansbury summarised his views on poor relief in his first published paper: "The Principles of the English Poor Law". His analysis offered a <a href="Marxism">Marxist</a> critique of capitalism: only the reorganisation of industry on collectivist lines would solve contemporary problems.

Lansbury added to his public duties when, in 1903, he was elected to <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Poplar">Poplar Borough Council</a>. In the summer of that year he met <a href="Joseph%20Fels">Joseph Fels</a>, a rich American soap manufacturer with a penchant for social projects. Lansbury persuaded Fels, in 1904, to purchase a 100-acre farm at <a href="Laindon">Laindon</a>, in Essex, which was converted into a labour colony that provided regular work for Poplar's unemployed and destitute. Fels also agreed to finance a much larger colony at <a href="Hollesley%20Bay%2C%20Suffolk">Hollesley Bay</a> in Suffolk, to be operated as a government scheme under the <a href="Local%20Government%20Board">Local Government Board</a>. Both projects were initially successful, but were undermined after the election of a Liberal government in 1906. The new Local Government minister was John Burns, a former SDF stalwart now ensconced in the Liberal Party who had become a firm opponent of socialism. Burns encouraged a campaign of propaganda to discredit the principle of labour colonies, which were presented as money-wasting ventures that pampered idlers and scroungers. A formal enquiry revealed irregularities in the operation of the scheme, though it exonerated Lansbury. He retained the confidence of his electorate and was easily re-elected to the Board of Guardians in 1907.

In 1905 Lansbury was appointed to a Royal Commission on the Poor Laws, which deliberated for four years. Lansbury, together with <a href="Beatrice%20Webb">Beatrice Webb</a> of the <a href="Fabian%20Society">Fabian Society</a>, argued for the complete abolition of the Poor Laws and their replacement by a system that incorporated old age pensions, a minimum wage, and national and local public works projects. These proposals were embodied at the Commission's conclusion in a minority report signed by Lansbury and Webb; the majority report was, according to Postgate, "an ill-considered jumble of suggestions ... so preposterously inadequate that no attempts were ever made to implement it." Most of the minority's recommendations in time became national policy; the Poor Laws were finally abolished by the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201929">Local Government Act 1929</a>.

In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201906">general election of January 1906</a> Lansbury stood as an independent socialist candidate in <a href="Middlesbrough%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Middlesbrough</a>, on a strong "votes for women" platform. This was his first campaign based on women's rights since the LCC election of 1889. He had been recommended to the constituency by Joseph Fels, who agreed to meet his expenses. The local ILP leadership was committed by an electoral pact to support the Liberal candidate, and could not endorse Lansbury, who secured less than 9 per cent of the vote. The campaign had been managed by <a href="Marion%20Coates%20Hansen">Marion Coates Hansen</a>, a prominent local suffragist. Under Hansen's influence Lansbury took up the cause of "votes for women"; he allied himself with the <a href="Women%27s%20Social%20and%20Political%20Union">Women's Social and Political Union</a> (WSPU), the more militant of the main suffragist organisations, and became a close associate of <a href="Emmeline%20Pankhurst">Emmeline Pankhurst</a> and her family.

The Liberal government elected in 1906 with a large majority showed little interest in the issue of women's suffrage; when they lost their parliamentary majority in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%20January%201910">general election of January 1910</a> they were dependent on the votes of the 40-odd Labour members. To Lansbury's dismay, Labour did not use this leverage to promote votes for women, instead giving the government virtually unqualified support to keep the Conservatives out of power. Lansbury had failed to win election as Labour's candidate at Bow and Bromley in January 1910; however, the continuing political crisis which developed from <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a>'s controversial 1909 "<a href="People%27s%20Budget">People's Budget</a>" led to another <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%20December%201910">general election in December 1910</a>. Lansbury again fought Bow and Bromley, and this time was successful.

Lansbury found little support in his fight for women's suffrage from his parliamentary Labour colleagues, whom he dismissed as "a weak, flabby lot". In parliament, he denounced the prime minister, <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">H. H. Asquith</a>, for the cruelties being inflicted on imprisoned suffragists: "You are beneath contempt ... you ought to be driven from public life". He was temporarily suspended from the House for "disorderly conduct". In October 1912, aware of the unbridgeable gap between his own position and that of his Labour colleagues, Lansbury resigned his seat to fight a <a href="Bow%20and%20Bromley%20by-election%2C%201912">by-election in Bow and Bromley</a> on the specific issue of women's suffrage. He lost to his Conservative opponent, who campaigned on the slogan "No Petticoat Government". Commenting on the result, the Labour MP <a href="Will%20Thorne">Will Thorne</a> opined that no constituency could ever be won on the single question of votes for women.

Out of parliament, on 26 April 1913 Lansbury addressed a WSPU rally at the <a href="Albert%20Hall">Albert Hall</a>, and openly defended violent methods: "Let them burn and destroy property and do anything they will, and for every leader that is taken away, let a dozen step forward in their place". For this, Lansbury was charged with incitement, convicted and, after the dismissal of an appeal, sentenced to three months' imprisonment. He immediately went on hunger strike, and was released after four days; although liable to rearrest under the so-called <a href="Prisoners%20%28Temporary%20Discharge%20for%20Ill%20Health%29%20Act%201913">"Cat and Mouse Act"</a>, he was thereafter left at liberty. In the autumn of 1913, at the invitation of Fels, Lansbury and his wife travelled to America and Canada for an extended holiday. On his return, he devoted his main efforts to the recently founded newspaper, the "<a href="Daily%20Herald%20%28UK%20newspaper%29">Daily Herald</a>".

The "Daily Herald" began as a temporary bulletin during the London printers' strike of 1910–11. After the strike ended, Lansbury and others raised sufficient funds for the "Herald" to be relaunched in April 1912 as a socialist daily newspaper. The paper attracted contributions from distinguished writers such as <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>, <a href="Hilaire%20Belloc">Hilaire Belloc</a>, <a href="G.%20K.%20Chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a> and <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a>, some of whom, Blythe notes, "weren't socialists at all but simply used [the paper] as a platform for their personal literary anarchy." Lansbury contributed regularly in support of his various causes, in particular the militant suffrage campaign, and early in 1914 assumed the paper's editorship.
Before the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> in August 1914, the "Herald" took a strong anti-war line. Addressing a large demonstration in <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a> on 2 August 1914, Lansbury blamed the coming conflict on capitalism: "The workers of all countries have no quarrel. They are ... exploited in times of peace and sent out to be massacred in times of war". Lansbury's position was at odds with that of most of the Labour movement, which allied itself with the wartime coalition governments of Asquith and, from 1916, Lloyd George. In the prevailing jingoistic mood, numerous readers looked to the "Herald"—reduced by wartime economies to a weekly format—to present a balanced news perspective, untainted by war fever and chauvinism. During the winter of 1914–15, Lansbury visited the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> trenches. He sent eye-witness accounts to the paper, which supported calls for a negotiated peace with Germany in line with President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>'s later "peace note" of January 1917. The paper also gave sympathetic coverage to conscientious objectors, and to Irish and Indian nationalists.

Lansbury used the pages of the "Daily Herald" to welcome the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%23February%20Revolution">February 1917 revolution in Russia</a> as "a new star of hope ... arisen over Europe". At an Albert Hall rally on 18 March 1918 he hailed the spirit and enthusiasm of "this Russian movement", and urged his audience to "be ready to die, if necessary, for our faith". When the war ended in November 1918, Lloyd George called an <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%20December%201918">immediate general election</a>, correctly calculating that victory euphoria would keep his coalition in power. In this triumphalist climate, candidates such as Lansbury who had opposed the war found themselves unpopular, and he failed to retake his Bow and Bromley seat.

The "Herald" re-emerged as a daily paper in March 1919. Under Lansbury's direction it maintained a strong and ultimately successful campaign against British intervention in the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a>. In February 1920 Lansbury travelled to Russia where he met <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Lenin</a> and other <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> leaders. He published an account: "What I Saw in Russia", but the impact of the visit was overshadowed by accusations that the "Herald" was being financed from Bolshevist sources, a charge vehemently denied by Lansbury: "We have received no Bolshevist money, no Bolshevist paper, no Bolshevist bonds". Unknown to Lansbury, the allegations had some truth which, when exposed, caused him and the paper considerable embarrassment. By 1922 the "Herald"s financial problems had become such that it could no longer continue as a private venture financed by donations. Lansbury resigned the editorship and made the paper over to the Labour Party and the <a href="Trades%20Union%20Congress">Trades Union Congress</a> (TUC), although he continued to write for it and remained its titular general manager until 3 January 1925.

Throughout his national campaigns, Lansbury remained a Poplar borough councillor and Poor Law guardian, and between 1910 and 1913 served a three-year term as a London County Councillor. In 1919 he became the first Labour mayor of <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Poplar">Poplar</a>. Under the then-existing financial system for local government, boroughs were individually responsible for poor relief within their boundaries. This discriminated heavily against poorer councils such as Poplar, where <a href="Rates%20%28tax%29">rates</a> revenues were low and poverty and unemployment, always severe, were exacerbated in times of economic recession. Under this system, Postgate argues, "The wealthy West End boroughs were evading responsibility, as though the desolate and silent docks were the results of a failure by the Poplar Borough Council". In addition to meeting the costs of its own obligations, the council was required to levy <a href="Precept%23Secular%20law">precepts</a> to pay for services provided by bodies such as the London County Council and the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police">Metropolitan Police</a>. Lansbury had long argued that a degree of rates equalisation across London was necessary, to share costs more fairly.

At its meeting on 22 March 1921 the Poplar Council resolved not to make its precepts and to apply these revenues to the costs of local poor relief. This illegal action created a sensation, and led to legal proceedings against the council. On 29 July the thirty councillors involved marched in procession from Bow to the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court</a>, headed by a brass band. Informed by the judge that they must apply the precepts, the councillors would not budge; early in September, Lansbury and 29 fellow-councillors were imprisoned for contempt of court. Among those sentenced were his son <a href="Edgar%20Lansbury%20%28politician%29">Edgar</a> and Edgar's wife, <a href="Minnie%20Lansbury">Minnie</a>.

The defiance of the Poplar councillors generated widespread interest and sympathy, and the publicity embarrassed the government. Several other Labour-controlled councils (including Stepney whose mayor was the future Labour leader <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a>) threatened similar policies. After six weeks' incarceration the councillors were released, and a government conference was convened to resolve the matter. This conference brought a significant personal victory for Lansbury: the passage of the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act, which equalised the poor relief burden across all the London boroughs. As a result, the rates in Poplar fell by a third, and additional revenues of £400,000 was gained by the borough. Lansbury was hailed as a hero; in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201922">1922 general election</a> he won the parliamentary seat of Bow and Bromley with a majority of nearly 7,000, and would hold it for the rest of his life. The term "Poplarism", always identified closely with Lansbury, became part of the political lexicon, applied generally to campaigns where local government stood against central government on behalf of the poor and least privileged of society.

In May 1923 the Conservative prime minister, <a href="Bonar%20Law">Bonar Law</a>, resigned for health reasons. In December his successor, <a href="Stanley%20Baldwin">Stanley Baldwin</a>, called <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201923">another election</a> in which the Conservatives lost their majority, with Labour in a strong second place. <a href="George%20V">King George V</a> advised Baldwin, as leader of the largest party, not to resign his office until defeated by a vote in the House of Commons.
Defeat duly occurred on 21 January 1924, when the Liberals decided to throw in their lot with Labour. The king then asked Labour's leader, <a href="Ramsay%20MacDonald">Ramsay MacDonald</a>, to form a government. Lansbury caused royal offence by publicly implying that the king had colluded with other parties to keep Labour out, and by his references to the fate of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>. Despite his seniority, Lansbury was offered only a junior non-cabinet post in the new government, which he declined. He believed that his exclusion from the cabinet followed pressure from the king. At the 1923 Labour Party conference, while declaring himself a <a href="Republicanism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">republican</a>, Lansbury opposed two motions calling for the abolition of the monarchy, deeming the issue a "distraction". Social revolution, he said, would one day remove the monarchy.
MacDonald's administration lasted less than a year before, in November 1924, the Liberals withdrew their support; Blythe comments that the first Labour government had been "neither exhilarating nor competent". According to Shepherd, MacDonald's chief priority was to show that Labour was "fit to govern", and he had thus acted with conservative caution. The <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201924">December general election</a> returned the Conservatives to power; Lansbury maintained that Labour's cause "marches forward irrespective of electoral results". After the defeat Lansbury was briefly touted as an alternative party leader to MacDonald, a proposition he rejected. In 1925, free from the "Daily Herald", he founded and edited "Lansbury's Labour Weekly", which became a mouthpiece for his personal creed of socialism, democracy and pacifism until it merged with the "<a href="Labour%20Leader">New Leader</a>" in 1927. Before the <a href="1926%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20strike">General Strike</a> of May 1926, Lansbury used the "Weekly" to instruct the <a href="Trades%20Union%20Congress">Trades Union Congress</a> (TUC) on preparations for the coming struggle. However, when the strike came the TUC did not want his assistance; among the reasons for their distrust was Lansbury's continuing advocacy for the right of communist organisations to affiliate to the Labour Party—he privately opined that British communists on their own "couldn't run a whelk-stall".

Lansbury continued his private campaigns in parliament, saying "I intend on every occasion to ... hinder the progress of business". In April 1926 he and 12 other opposition MPs prevented a vote in the House of Commons by obstructing the voting lobbies; they were temporarily suspended by the <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Speaker</a>. During frequent clashes in the House with <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a>, the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Health">Minister of Health</a> responsible for Poor Law administration and reform, Lansbury referred to the "Ministry of Death", and called the minister a "pinchbeck Napoleon". However, within the Labour Party itself, Lansbury's status and popularity led to his election as the party's chairman (a largely titular office) in 1927–28. Lansbury also became president of the International League Against Imperialism, where among his fellow executive members were <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>, <a href="Soong%20Ching-ling">Mme. Sun Yat-sen</a> and <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>. In 1928, short of money following the failure of the family business, Lansbury published his autobiography, "My Life", for which he received what he termed "a fairly generous cheque" from the publishers, <a href="Constable%20%26amp%3B%20Robinson">Constable & Co.</a>

In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201929">1929 general election</a> Labour emerged as the largest party, with 287 seats—but without an overall majority. Once again, MacDonald formed a government dependent on Liberal support. Lansbury joined the new cabinet as <a href="First%20Commissioner%20of%20Works">First Commissioner of Works</a>, with responsibilities for historic buildings and monuments and for the royal parks. This position was widely regarded as a <a href="sinecure">sinecure</a>; nevertheless, Lansbury proved an active minister who did much to improve public recreation facilities. His most notable achievement was the Lido on the <a href="Serpentine%20%28lake%29">Serpentine</a> in Hyde Park; according to the historian <a href="A.%20J.%20P.%20Taylor">A. J. P. Taylor</a> "the only thing which keeps the memory of the second Labour government alive". A circular memorial plaque to Lansbury can be seen on the exterior wall of the Lido Bar and Cafe. Lansbury's duties brought him into frequent contact with the King, who as Ranger of the royal parks insisted on regular consultation. Contrary to the expectations of some the two formed a cordial relationship.

The years of MacDonald's second government were dominated by the economic depression that followed the <a href="Wall%20Street%20Crash">Wall Street Crash</a> of October 1929. Lansbury was appointed to a committee, chaired by <a href="J.H.%20Thomas">J.H. Thomas</a> and including Sir <a href="Oswald%20Mosley">Oswald Mosley</a>, charged with finding a solution to unemployment. Mosley produced a memorandum which called for a large-scale programme of public works; this was rejected by the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, <a href="Philip%20Snowden%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Snowden">Philip Snowden</a>, on grounds of cost. At the end of July 1931 the <a href="May%20Committee">May Committee</a>, appointed in February to investigate government spending, prescribed heavy cuts, including a massive reduction in unemployment benefit.
During August, in an atmosphere of financial panic and a run on the pound, the government debated the report. MacDonald and Snowden were prepared to implement it, but Lansbury and nine other cabinet ministers rejected the cut in unemployment benefit. Thus divided, the government could not continue; MacDonald, however, did not resign as prime minister. After discussions with the opposition leaders and the king he formed a national all-party coalition, with a "doctor's mandate" to tackle the economic crisis. The great majority of Labour MPs, including Lansbury, were opposed to this action; MacDonald and the few who followed him were expelled from the party, and <a href="Arthur%20Henderson">Arthur Henderson</a> became leader. MacDonald's move was broadly welcomed in the country, however, and in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201931">general election held in October 1931</a> the national government was returned with an enormous majority. Labour was reduced to 46 members; Lansbury was the only senior member of the Labour leadership to retain his seat.

Although defeated in the election, Henderson remained the party leader while Lansbury headed the Labour group in parliament—the <a href="Parliamentary%20Labour%20Party">Parliamentary Labour Party</a> (PLP). In October 1932 Henderson resigned and Lansbury succeeded him. In most historians' reckonings, Lansbury led his small parliamentary force with skill and flair. He was also, says Shepherd, an inspiration to the dispirited Labour rank and file. As leader he began the process of reforming the party's organisation and machinery, efforts which resulted in considerable by-election and municipal election successes—including control of the LCC under <a href="Herbert%20Morrison">Herbert Morrison</a> in 1934. According to Blythe, Lansbury "represented political hope and decency to the three million unemployed." During this period Lansbury published his political credo, "My England" (1934), which envisioned a future socialist state achieved by a mixture of revolutionary and evolutionary methods.

The small Labour group in parliament had little influence over economic policy; Lansbury's term as leader was dominated by foreign affairs and disarmament, and by policy disagreements within the Labour movement. The official party position was based on collective security through the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> and on multilateral disarmament. Lansbury, supported by many in the PLP, adopted a position of Christian pacifism, unilateral disarmament and the dismantling of the British Empire. Under his influence the party's 1933 conference passed resolutions calling for the "total disarmament of all nations", and pledged to take no part in war. Pacifism became temporarily popular in the country; on 9 February 1933 the <a href="Oxford%20Union">Oxford Union</a> <a href="The%20King%20and%20Country%20debate">voted</a> by 275 to 153 that it would "in no circumstances fight for its King and Country", and the <a href="Fulham%20East%20by-election%2C%201933">Fulham East by-election</a> in October 1933 was easily won by a Labour candidate committed to full disarmament. Lansbury sent a message to the constituency in his position as Labour Leader: "I would close every recruiting station, disband the Army and disarm the Air Force. I would abolish the whole dreadful equipment of war and say to the world: “Do your worst”." October 1934 saw the emergence of the <a href="Peace%20Pledge%20Union">Peace Pledge Union</a>. In response to the Peace Pledge Union, the League of Nations Union conducted the 1934–35 <a href="Peace%20Ballot">Peace Ballot</a>, an unofficial public referendum, which produced massive majorities in support of the League of Nations, multilateral disarmament, and conflict resolution through non-military means - though crucially, a three-fold majority supported military measures as a last resort. Meanwhile, <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> had come to power in Germany, and had withdrawn from the international Conference on Disarmament in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>. Blythe observes that Britain's noisy flirtations with pacifism "drowned out the sounds from German dockyards", as German rearmament began.

As fascism and militarism advanced in Europe, Lansbury's pacifist stance drew criticism from the trades union elements of his party—who controlled the majority of party conference votes. <a href="Walter%20Citrine">Walter Citrine</a>, the <a href="General%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Trades%20Union%20Congress">TUC general secretary</a>, commented that Lansbury "thinks the country should be without defence of any kind ... it certainly isn't our policy." The party's 1935 annual conference took place in Brighton during October, under the shadow of Italy's impending invasion of <a href="Ethiopia">Abyssinia</a>. The national executive had tabled a resolution calling for sanctions against Italy, which Lansbury opposed as a form of economic warfare. His speech—a passionate exposition of the principles of Christian pacifism—was well received by the delegates, but immediately afterwards his position was destroyed by <a href="Ernest%20Bevin">Ernest Bevin</a>, the <a href="Transport%20and%20General%20Workers%27%20Union">Transport and General Workers' Union</a> leader. Bevin attacked Lansbury for putting his private beliefs before a policy, agreed by all the party's main institutions, to oppose fascist aggression, and accused him of "hawking your conscience round from body to body asking to be told what to do with it". Union support ensured that the sanctions resolution was carried by a huge majority; Lansbury, realising that a Christian pacifist could no longer lead the party, resigned a few days later.

Lansbury was 76 years old when he resigned the Labour leadership; he did not, however, retire from public life. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201935">general election of November 1935</a> he kept his seat at Bow and Bromley; Labour, now led by Attlee, improved its parliamentary representation to 154. Lansbury devoted himself entirely to the cause of world peace, a quest that took him, in 1936, to the United States. He addressed large crowds in 27 cities before meeting <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">President Roosevelt</a> in Washington to present his proposals for a world peace conference. In 1937 he toured Europe, visiting leaders in Belgium, France and Scandinavia, and in April secured a private meeting with Hitler. No official report of the discussion was issued, but Lansbury's personal memorandum indicates that Hitler expressed willingness to join in a world conference if Roosevelt would convene it. Later that year Lansbury met <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Mussolini</a> in Rome; he described the Italian leader as "a mixture of Lloyd George, Stanley Baldwin and Winston Churchill". Lansbury wrote several accounts of his peace journeys, notably "My Quest for Peace" (1938). His mild and optimistic impressions of the European dictators were widely criticised as naïve and out of touch; some British pacifists were dismayed at Lansbury's meeting with Hitler, while the "<a href="Morning%20Star%20%28UK%20newspaper%29">Daily Worker</a>" accused him of diverting attention from the aggressive realities of fascist policies. Lansbury continued to meet European leaders through 1938 and 1939, and was nominated, unsuccessfully, for the 1940 <a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a>.
At home, Lansbury served a second term as Mayor of Poplar, in 1936–37. He argued against direct confrontation with Mosley's <a href="British%20Union%20of%20Fascists">Blackshirts</a> during the October 1936 demonstrations known as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cable%20Street">Battle of Cable Street</a>. In October 1937 he became president of the Peace Pledge Union, and a year later he welcomed the <a href="Munich%20Agreement">Munich Agreement</a> as a step towards peace. During this period he worked on behalf of refugees from Nazi Germany, and was chairman of the Polish Refugee Fund which provided relief to displaced Jewish children. On 3 September 1939, after <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a>'s announcement of war with Germany, Lansbury addressed the House of Commons. Observing that the cause to which he had dedicated his life was going down in ruins, he added: "I hope that out of this terrible calamity will arise a spirit that will compel people to give up the reliance on force."

Early in 1940 Lansbury's health began to fail; although unaware, he was suffering from <a href="stomach%20cancer">stomach cancer</a>. In an article published in the socialist magazine "Tribune", published on 25 April 1940, he made a final statement of his Christian pacifism: "I hold fast to the truth that this world is big enough for all, that we are all brethren, children of one Father". Lansbury died on 7 May 1940, at the Manor House Hospital in <a href="Golders%20Green">Golders Green</a>. His funeral in <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Bow">St Mary's Church, Bow</a>, was followed by cremation at Ilford Crematorium, before a memorial service in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. His ashes were scattered at sea, in accordance with the wish expressed in his will: "I desire this because although I love England very dearly ... I am a convinced internationalist".

Most historical assessments of Lansbury have tended to stress his character and principles rather than his effectiveness as a party political leader. His biographer Jonathan Schneer writes:
Historian A.J.P. Taylor labeled Lansbury as "the most lovable figure in modern politics" and the outstanding figure of the English revolutionary left in the 20th century, while <a href="Kenneth%20O.%20Morgan">Kenneth O. Morgan</a>, in his biography of a later Labour leader, <a href="Michael%20Foot">Michael Foot</a>, regards Lansbury as "an agitator of protest, not a politician of power". Journalists commonly accused Lansbury of sentimentality, and party intellectuals accused him of lacking mental capacity. Nevertheless, his speeches in the House of Commons were often flavoured with historical and literary allusions, and he left behind a considerable body of writing on socialist ideas; Morgan refers to him as a "prophet". Foot, who as a young man met and was influenced by Lansbury, was particularly impressed by the older man's achievements in establishing the "Daily Herald", given his complete lack of journalistic training. Nevertheless, Foot felt that Lansbury's pacifism was unrealistic, and believed that Bevin's demolition at the 1935 conference was justified.

There is much agreement among historians and analysts that Lansbury was never self-serving and, guided by his <a href="Christian%20socialism">Christian socialist</a> principles, was consistent in his efforts on behalf of the poorest in society. Shepherd believes that "there could have been no better leader for the Labour Party at the collapse of its political fortunes in 1931 than Lansbury, a universally popular choice and a source of inspiration among Labour ranks". In the House of Commons on 8 May 1940, the day following Lansbury's death, Chamberlain said of him: "There were not many hon. Members who felt convinced of the practicability of the methods which he advocated for the preservation of peace, but there was no one who did not realise his intense conviction, which arose out of his deep humanitarianism". Attlee also paid tribute to his former leader: "He hated cruelty, injustice and wrongs, and felt deeply for all who suffered ... [H]e was ever the champion of the weak, and ... to the end of his life he strove for that in which he believed".

After the Second World War, a stained glass window designed by the Belgian artist Eugeen Yoors was placed in the <a href="Kingsley%20Hall">Kingsley Hall</a> community centre in Bow, as a memorial to Lansbury. His memory is further sustained by streets and housing developments named after him, most notably the <a href="Lansbury%20Estate">Lansbury Estate</a> in Poplar, completed in 1951. A further enduring memorial, Attlee suggests, is the extent to which the then-revolutionary social policies that Lansbury began advocating before the turn of the 20th century had become accepted mainstream doctrine little more than a decade after his death.

His name and picture (and those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters) are on the <a href="plinth">plinth</a> of the <a href="statue%20of%20Millicent%20Fawcett">statue of Millicent Fawcett</a> in <a href="Parliament%20Square">Parliament Square</a>, London, unveiled in 2018.

George married Elizabeth Jane (Bessie) Brine on 22 May 1880 in Whitechapel, London. For most of their married life, George and Bessie Lansbury lived in Bow, originally in St Stephen's Road and, from 1916, at 39 Bow Road, a house which, Shepherd records, became "a political haven" for those requiring assistance of any kind. Bessie died in 1933, after 53 years of a marriage that had produced 12 children between 1881 and 1905. Of the 10 who survived to adulthood, Edgar followed his father into local political activism as a Poplar councillor in 1912, serving as the borough's mayor in 1924–25. He was for a time a member of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">Communist Party of Great Britain</a> (CPGB). After the death of his first wife Minnie in 1922, Edgar married <a href="Moyna%20Macgill">Moyna Macgill</a>, an actress from Belfast; their daughter Dame <a href="Angela%20Lansbury">Angela Lansbury</a>, born in 1925, became a stage and screen actress. George Lansbury's youngest daughter Violet (1900–71) was an active CPGB member in the 1920s, who lived and worked in Moscow for many years. She married Clemens Palme Dutt, the brother of the Marxist intellectual <a href="Rajani%20Palme%20Dutt">Rajani Palme Dutt</a>.

Another daughter, <a href="Dorothy%20Lansbury">Dorothy</a> (1890–1973), was a women's rights activist and later a campaigner for contraceptive and abortion rights.

Epsilon Eridani

Epsilon Eridani (ε Eridani, abbreviated Epsilon Eri, ε Eri), also named Ran (), is a <a href="star">star</a> in the southern <a href="constellation">constellation</a> of <a href="Eridanus%20%28constellation%29">Eridanus</a>, at a <a href="declination">declination</a> of 9.46° south of the <a href="celestial%20equator">celestial equator</a>. This allows it to be visible from most of Earth's surface. At a distance of from the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, it has an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of 3.73. It is the <a href="List%20of%20nearest%20stars">third-closest</a> individual star or <a href="star%20system">star system</a> visible to the unaided eye.

The star is estimated to be less than a billion years old. Because of its relative youth, Epsilon Eridani has a higher level of <a href="stellar%20magnetic%20field">magnetic activity</a> than the present-day Sun, with a <a href="stellar%20wind">stellar wind</a> 30 times as strong. Its <a href="stellar%20rotation">rotation</a> period is 11.2 days at the equator. Epsilon Eridani is smaller and less massive than the Sun, and has a comparatively lower level of <a href="metallicity">elements heavier than helium</a>. It is a <a href="main%20sequence">main-sequence star</a> of <a href="spectral%20class">spectral class</a> K2, which means that energy generated at the core through <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a> of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> is emitted from the surface at a temperature of about , giving it an orange hue.

The <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a> ε Eridani (Latinised as Epsilon Eridani) was established in 1603 by <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>. It may be a member of the <a href="Ursa%20Major%20Moving%20Group">Ursa Major Moving Group</a> of stars that share a similar motion through the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>, implying these stars shared a common origin in an <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a>. Its nearest neighbour, the <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> system <a href="Luyten%20726-8">Luyten 726-8</a>, will have a close encounter with Epsilon Eridani in approximately 31,500 years when they will be separated by about .

The motion of Epsilon Eridani along the line of sight to Earth, known as the <a href="radial%20velocity">radial velocity</a>, has been regularly observed for more than twenty years. Periodic changes in its value <a href="Methods%20of%20detecting%20extrasolar%20planets%23Radial%20velocity">yielded evidence</a> of a <a href="giant%20planet">giant planet</a> orbiting the star, making it one of the closest star systems with a candidate <a href="exoplanet">exoplanet</a>. The discovery of the planet has been controversial because of the amount of background noise in the radial velocity data, particularly in the early observation, but many astronomers now regard the planet as confirmed. In 2016 it was given the alternative name AEgir .

The Epsilon Eridani system also includes two belts of rocky <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>s: at about 3 AU and 20 AU from the star. The orbital structure could be maintained by a hypothetical second planet, which if confirmed would be Epsilon Eridani c. Epsilon Eridani hosts an extensive outer <a href="debris%20disk">debris disk</a> of remnant <a href="planetesimal">planetesimal</a>s left over from the system's formation.

As one of the nearest <a href="Solar%20analog">Sun-like stars</a> with a planet, Epsilon Eridani has been the target of several observations in the <a href="search%20for%20extraterrestrial%20intelligence">search for extraterrestrial intelligence</a>. Epsilon Eridani appears in <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> stories and has been suggested as a destination for <a href="interstellar%20travel">interstellar travel</a>. From Epsilon Eridani, the Sun would appear as a 2.4-magnitude star in <a href="Serpens">Serpens</a>.

"ε Eridani" (<a href="Latinisation%20of%20names">Latinised</a> to "Epsilon Eridani") is the system's <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a> (<a href="Epsilon%20Eridani%23Cataloguing">see below</a>). Despite being a relatively bright star, it was not <a href="List%20of%20proper%20names%20of%20stars">given a proper name</a> by early astronomers. It has several other <a href="stellar%20designation">catalogue designations</a>. Upon its discovery, the planet was designated Epsilon Eridani b, following the usual <a href="exoplanet%20naming%20convention">designation system for extrasolar planets</a>.

The planet and its host star were selected by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> (IAU) as part of a competition for giving proper names to exoplanets and their host stars, for some systems that did not already have proper names. The process involved nominations by educational groups and public voting for the proposed names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning names were "Ran" for the star and "AEgir" for the planet. Those names had been submitted by the pupils of the <a href="School%20grades%20%28US%29">8th Grade</a> at Mountainside Middle School in <a href="Colbert%2C%20Washington">Colbert, Washington</a>, United States. Both names derive from <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>: <a href="R%C3%A1n">Rán</a> is the goddess of the sea and <a href="%C3%86gir">Ægir</a>, her husband, is the god of the ocean.

The names at that point remained unofficial, but in 2016 the IAU organised a <a href="IAU%20Working%20Group%20on%20Star%20Names">Working Group on Star Names</a> (WGSN) to catalogue and standardise proper names for stars. In its first bulletin of July 2016, the WGSN explicitly recognised the names of exoplanets and their host stars that were produced by the competition. Epsilon Eridani is now listed as Ran in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. It is not yet clear whether professional astronomers will generally use the new name, or continue to refer to the star as Epsilon Eridani; both are now equally valid.

In <a href="Chinese%20language">Chinese</a>, (), meaning "<a href="Hairy%20Head%20%28Chinese%20constellation%29">Celestial Meadows</a>", refers to an asterism consisting of ε Eridani, <a href="Gamma%20Eridani">γ Eridani</a>, <a href="Delta%20Eridani">δ Eridani</a>, <a href="Pi%20Eridani">π Eridani</a>, <a href="Zeta%20Eridani">ζ Eridani</a>, <a href="Eta%20Eridani">η Eridani</a>, <a href="Pi%20Ceti">π Ceti</a>, <a href="Tau1%20Eridani">τ Eridani</a>, <a href="Tau2%20Eridani">τ Eridani</a>, <a href="Tau3%20Eridani">τ Eridani</a>, <a href="Tau4%20Eridani">τ Eridani</a>, <a href="Tau5%20Eridani">τ Eridani</a>, <a href="Tau6%20Eridani">τ Eridani</a>, <a href="Tau7%20Eridani">τ Eridani</a>, <a href="Tau8%20Eridani">τ Eridani</a> and <a href="Tau9%20Eridani">τ Eridani</a>. Consequently, ε Eridani itself is known as (, the Fourth [Star] of Celestial Meadows.)

Epsilon Eridani has been known to astronomers since at least the 2nd century AD, when <a href="Claudius%20Ptolemy">Claudius Ptolemy</a> (a <a href="Greek%20astronomy">Greek astronomer</a> from <a href="History%20of%20Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">Egypt</a>) included it in his catalogue of more than a thousand stars. The catalogue was published as part of his astronomical treatise the "<a href="Almagest">Almagest</a>". The constellation <a href="Eridanus%20%28constellation%29">Eridanus</a> was named by Ptolemy (, River), and Epsilon Eridani was listed as its thirteenth star. Ptolemy called Epsilon Eridani , (here is the number four). This refers to a group of four stars in Eridanus: <a href="Gamma%20Eridani">γ</a>, <a href="Pi%20Eridani">π</a>, <a href="Delta%20Eridani">δ</a> and ε (10th–13th in Ptolemy's list). ε is the most western of these, and thus the first of the four in the apparent daily motion of the sky from east to west. Modern scholars of Ptolemy's catalogue designate its entry as ""P 784"" (in order of appearance) and ""Eri 13"". Ptolemy described the star's <a href="apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a> as 3.

Epsilon Eridani was included in several star catalogues of <a href="Astronomy%20in%20medieval%20Islam">medieval Islamic</a> astronomical treatises, which were based on Ptolemy's catalogue: in <a href="Abd%20al-Rahman%20al-Sufi">Al-Sufi</a>'s "<a href="Book%20of%20Fixed%20Stars">Book of Fixed Stars</a>", published in 964, <a href="Ab%C5%AB%20Ray%E1%B8%A5%C4%81n%20al-B%C4%ABr%C5%ABn%C4%AB">Al-Biruni</a>'s "Mas'ud Canon", published in 1030, and <a href="Ulugh%20Beg">Ulugh Beg</a>'s "<a href="Zij-i%20Sultani">Zij-i Sultani</a>", published in 1437. Al-Sufi's estimate of Epsilon Eridani's magnitude was 3. Al-Biruni quotes magnitudes from Ptolemy and Al-Sufi (for Epsilon Eridani he quotes the value 4 for both Ptolemy's and Al-Sufi's magnitudes; original values of both these magnitudes are 3). Its number in order of appearance is 786. Ulugh Beg carried out new measurements of Epsilon Eridani's coordinates in <a href="Ulugh%20Beg%20Observatory">his observatory</a> at <a href="Samarkand">Samarkand</a>, and quotes magnitudes from Al-Sufi (3 for Epsilon Eridani). The modern designations of its entry in Ulugh Beg's catalogue are ""U 781"" and ""Eri 13"" (the latter is the same as Ptolemy's catalogue designation).

In 1598 Epsilon Eridani was included in <a href="Tycho%20Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a>'s star catalogue, republished in 1627 by <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a> as part of his "<a href="Rudolphine%20Tables">Rudolphine Tables</a>". This catalogue was based on Tycho Brahe's observations of 1577–1597, including those on the island of <a href="Hven">Hven</a> at his observatories of <a href="Uraniborg">Uraniborg</a> and <a href="Stjerneborg">Stjerneborg</a>. The sequence number of Epsilon Eridani in the constellation Eridanus was 10, and it was designated , ; the meaning is the same as Ptolemy's description. Brahe assigned it magnitude 3.

Epsilon Eridani's <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a> was established in 1603 as part of the "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>", a star catalogue produced by German celestial cartographer <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>. His catalogue assigned letters from the <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek alphabet</a> to groups of stars belonging to the same visual magnitude class in each constellation, beginning with alpha (α) for a star in the brightest class. Bayer made no attempt to arrange stars by relative brightness within each class. Thus, although Epsilon is the fifth letter in the Greek alphabet, the star is the <a href="List%20of%20stars%20in%20Eridanus">tenth-brightest in Eridanus</a>. In addition to the letter ε, Bayer had given it the number 13 (the same as Ptolemy's catalogue number, as were many of Bayer's numbers) and described it as , . Bayer assigned Epsilon Eridani magnitude 3.

In 1690 Epsilon Eridani was included in the star catalogue of <a href="Johannes%20Hevelius">Johannes Hevelius</a>. Its sequence number in constellation Eridanus was 14, its designation was ("the third"), and it was assigned magnitude 3 or 4 (sources differ). The star catalogue of English astronomer <a href="John%20Flamsteed">John Flamsteed</a>, published in 1712, gave Epsilon Eridani the <a href="Flamsteed%20designation">Flamsteed designation</a> of 18 Eridani, because it was the eighteenth catalogued star in the constellation of Eridanus by order of increasing <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a>. In 1818 Epsilon Eridani was included in <a href="Friedrich%20Bessel">Friedrich Bessel</a>'s catalogue, based on <a href="James%20Bradley">James Bradley</a>'s observations from 1750–1762, and at magnitude 4. It also appeared in <a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</a>'s catalogue of 398 principal stars, whose 307-star version was published in 1755 in the , and whose full version was published in 1757 in ", Paris". In its 1831 edition by <a href="Francis%20Baily">Francis Baily</a>, Epsilon Eridani has the number 50. Lacaille assigned it magnitude 3.

In 1801 Epsilon Eridani was included in , <a href="Joseph%20J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Lefran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Lalande">Joseph Jérôme Lefrançois de Lalande</a>'s catalogue of about 50,000 stars, based on his observations of 1791–1800, in which observations are arranged in time order. It contains three observations of Epsilon Eridani. In 1847, a new edition of Lalande's catalogue was published by Francis Baily, containing the majority of its observations, in which the stars were numbered in order of <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a>. Because every observation of each star was numbered and Epsilon Eridani was observed three times, it got three numbers: 6581, 6582 and 6583. (Today numbers from this catalogue are used with the prefix "Lalande", or "Lal".) Lalande assigned Epsilon Eridani magnitude 3. Also in 1801 it was included in the catalogue of <a href="Johann%20Bode">Johann Bode</a>, in which about 17,000 stars were grouped into 102 constellations and numbered (Epsilon Eridani got the number 159 in the constellation Eridanus). Bode's catalogue was based on observations of various astronomers, including Bode himself, but mostly on Lalande's and Lacaille's (for the southern sky). Bode assigned Epsilon Eridani magnitude 3. In 1814 <a href="Giuseppe%20Piazzi">Giuseppe Piazzi</a> published the second edition of his star catalogue (its first edition was published in 1803), based on observations during 1792–1813, in which more than 7000 stars were grouped into 24 hours (0—23). Epsilon Eridani is number 89 in hour 3. Piazzi assigned it magnitude 4. In 1918 Epsilon Eridani appeared in the <a href="Henry%20Draper%20Catalogue">Henry Draper Catalogue</a> with the designation HD 22049 and a preliminary spectral classification of K0.

Based on observations between 1800 and 1880, Epsilon Eridani was found to have a large <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> across the <a href="celestial%20sphere">celestial sphere</a>, which was estimated at three <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>s per year (<a href="angular%20velocity">angular velocity</a>). This movement implied it was relatively close to the Sun, making it a star of interest for the purpose of <a href="stellar%20parallax">stellar parallax</a> measurements. This process involves recording the position of Epsilon Eridani as Earth moves around the Sun, which allows a star's distance to be estimated. From 1881 to 1883, American astronomer <a href="William%20Lewis%20Elkin">William L. Elkin</a> used a <a href="heliometer">heliometer</a> at the <a href="Royal%20Observatory%20at%20the%20Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope</a>, South Africa, to compare the position of Epsilon Eridani with two nearby stars. From these observations, a parallax of was calculated. By 1917, observers had refined their parallax estimate to 0.317 arcseconds. The modern value of 0.3109 arcseconds is equivalent to a distance of about .

Based on apparent changes in the position of Epsilon Eridani between 1938 and 1972, <a href="Peter%20van%20de%20Kamp">Peter van de Kamp</a> proposed that an unseen companion with an orbital period of 25 years was causing gravitational <a href="Perturbation%20%28astronomy%29">perturbations</a> in its position. This claim was refuted in 1993 by <a href="Wulff-Dieter%20Heintz">Wulff-Dieter Heintz</a> and the false detection was blamed on a systematic error in the <a href="photographic%20plate">photographic plate</a>s.

Launched in 1983, the <a href="space%20telescope">space telescope</a> <a href="IRAS">IRAS</a> detected <a href="Infrared%20astronomy">infrared</a> emissions from stars near to the Sun, including an <a href="infrared%20excess">excess infrared emission</a> from Epsilon Eridani. The observations indicated a disk of fine-grained <a href="cosmic%20dust">cosmic dust</a> was orbiting the star; this <a href="debris%20disk">debris disk</a> has since been extensively studied. Evidence for a planetary system was discovered in 1998 by the observation of asymmetries in this dust ring. The clumping in the dust distribution could be explained by gravitational interactions with a planet orbiting just inside the dust ring.

In 1987, the detection of an orbiting planetary object was announced by Bruce Campbell, Gordon Walker and Stephenson Yang. From 1980 to 2000, a team of astronomers led by <a href="Artie%20P.%20Hatzes">Artie P. Hatzes</a> made <a href="radial%20velocity">radial velocity</a> observations of Epsilon Eridani, measuring the <a href="Doppler%20spectroscopy">Doppler shift of the star along the line of sight</a>. They found evidence of a planet orbiting the star with a period of about seven years. Although there is a high level of noise in the radial velocity data due to magnetic activity in its <a href="photosphere">photosphere</a>, any periodicity caused by this magnetic activity is expected to show a strong correlation with variations in <a href="emission%20line">emission line</a>s of ionized calcium (the <a href="Calcium%23H%20and%20K%20lines">Ca II H and K lines</a>). Because no such correlation was found, a planetary companion was deemed the most likely cause. This discovery was supported by <a href="astrometric">astrometric</a> measurements of Epsilon Eridani made between 2001 and 2003 with the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, which showed evidence for <a href="gravitational%20perturbation">gravitational perturbation</a> of Epsilon Eridani by a planet.

Astrophysicist Alice C. Quillen and her student <a href="Stephen%20Thorndike">Stephen Thorndike</a> performed computer simulations of the structure of the dust disk around Epsilon Eridani. Their model suggested that the clumping of the dust particles could be explained by the presence of a second planet in an eccentric orbit, which they announced in 2002.

In 1960, physicists <a href="Philip%20Morrison">Philip Morrison</a> and <a href="Giuseppe%20Cocconi">Giuseppe Cocconi</a> proposed that <a href="extraterrestrial%20civilization">extraterrestrial civilisations</a> might be using radio signals for communication. <a href="Project%20Ozma">Project Ozma</a>, led by astronomer <a href="Frank%20Drake">Frank Drake</a>, used the <a href="Tatel%20Telescope">Tatel Telescope</a> to search for such signals from the nearby <a href="Solar-type%20star">Sun-like stars</a> Epsilon Eridani and <a href="Tau%20Ceti">Tau Ceti</a>. The systems were observed at the <a href="Hydrogen%20line">emission frequency of neutral hydrogen</a>, 1,420 MHz (21 cm). No signals of intelligent extraterrestrial origin were detected. Drake repeated the experiment in 2010, with the same negative result. Despite this lack of success, Epsilon Eridani made its way into <a href="Epsilon%20Eridani%20in%20fiction">science fiction literature and television shows</a> for many years following news of Drake's initial experiment.

In "Habitable Planets for Man", a 1964 <a href="RAND%20Corporation">RAND Corporation</a> study by space scientist Stephen H. Dole, the probability of a <a href="habitable%20planet">habitable planet</a> being in orbit around Epsilon Eridani were estimated at 3.3%. Among the known nearby stars, it was listed with the 14 stars that were thought most likely to have a habitable planet.

<a href="William%20I.%20McLaughlin">William I. McLaughlin</a> proposed a new strategy in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (<a href="SETI">SETI</a>) in 1977. He suggested that widely observable events such as <a href="nova">nova</a> explosions might be used by intelligent extraterrestrials to synchronise the transmission and reception of their signals. This idea was tested by the <a href="National%20Radio%20Astronomy%20Observatory">National Radio Astronomy Observatory</a> in 1988, which used outbursts of <a href="Nova%20Cygni%201975">Nova Cygni 1975</a> as the timer. Fifteen days of observation showed no anomalous radio signals coming from Epsilon Eridani.

Because of the proximity and Sun-like properties of Epsilon Eridani, in 1985 physicist and author <a href="Robert%20L.%20Forward">Robert L. Forward</a> considered the system as a plausible target for <a href="interstellar%20travel">interstellar travel</a>. The following year, the <a href="British%20Interplanetary%20Society">British Interplanetary Society</a> suggested Epsilon Eridani as one of the targets in its <a href="Project%20Daedalus">Project Daedalus</a> study. The system has continued to be among the targets of such proposals, such as <a href="Project%20Icarus%20%28Interstellar%20Probe%20Design%20Study%29">Project Icarus</a> in 2011.

Based on its nearby location, Epsilon Eridani was among the target stars for <a href="Project%20Phoenix%20%28SETI%29">Project Phoenix</a>, a 1995 <a href="microwave">microwave</a> survey for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence. The project had checked about 800 stars by 2004 but had not yet detected any signals.

At a distance of , Epsilon Eridani is the 13th-nearest known star (and ninth nearest solitary star or <a href="stellar%20system">stellar system</a>) to the Sun as of 2014. Its proximity makes it one of the most studied stars of its <a href="stellar%20classification">spectral type</a>. Epsilon Eridani is located in the northern part of the constellation Eridanus, about 3° east of the slightly brighter star <a href="Delta%20Eridani">Delta Eridani</a>. With a declination of −9.46°, Epsilon Eridani can be viewed from much of Earth's surface, at suitable times of year. Only to the north of <a href="80th%20parallel%20north">latitude 80° N</a> is it permanently hidden below the horizon. The <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of 3.73 can make it difficult to observe from an urban area with the unaided eye, because the night skies over cities are obscured by <a href="light%20pollution">light pollution</a>.

Epsilon Eridani has an estimated mass of 0.82 <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a>es and a radius of 0.74 <a href="solar%20radius">solar radii</a>. It shines with a luminosity of only 0.34 <a href="solar%20luminosity">solar luminosities</a>. The estimated <a href="effective%20temperature">effective temperature</a> is 5,084 K. With a stellar classification of K2 V, it is the second-nearest <a href="K-type%20main-sequence%20star">K-type main-sequence star</a> (after <a href="Alpha%20Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a> B). Since 1943 the <a href="stellar%20spectrum">spectrum</a> of Epsilon Eridani has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. Its <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a>, the fraction of elements heavier than <a href="helium">helium</a>, is slightly lower than the Sun's. In Epsilon Eridani's <a href="chromosphere">chromosphere</a>, a region of the outer atmosphere just above the light emitting <a href="photosphere">photosphere</a>, the abundance of iron is estimated at 74% of the Sun's value. The proportion of <a href="lithium">lithium</a> in the atmosphere is five times less than that in the Sun.

Epsilon Eridani's K-type classification indicates that the spectrum has relatively weak <a href="absorption%20line">absorption line</a>s from absorption by hydrogen (<a href="Balmer%20lines">Balmer lines</a>) but strong lines of neutral atoms and singly <a href="ion">ion</a>ized <a href="Calcium%23H%20and%20K%20lines">calcium</a> (Ca II). The <a href="luminosity%20class">luminosity class</a> V (dwarf) is assigned to stars that are undergoing <a href="thermonuclear%20fusion">thermonuclear fusion</a> of hydrogen in their core. For a K-type main-sequence star, this fusion is dominated by the <a href="proton%E2%80%93proton%20chain%20reaction">proton–proton chain reaction</a>, in which a series of reactions effectively combines four hydrogen nuclei to form a helium nucleus. The energy released by fusion is transported outward from the core through <a href="radiative%20transfer">radiation</a>, which results in no net motion of the surrounding plasma. Outside of this region, in the envelope, energy is carried to the photosphere by <a href="Convection%20zone">plasma convection</a>, where it then radiates into space.

Epsilon Eridani has a higher level of <a href="Stellar%20magnetic%20field">magnetic activity</a> than the Sun, and thus the outer parts of its atmosphere (the <a href="chromosphere">chromosphere</a> and <a href="corona">corona</a>) are more dynamic. The average magnetic field strength of Epsilon Eridani across the entire surface is , which is more than forty times greater than the magnetic-field strength in the Sun's photosphere. The magnetic properties can be modeled by assuming that regions with a <a href="magnetic%20flux">magnetic flux</a> of about 0.14 T randomly cover approximately 9% of the photosphere, whereas the remainder of the surface is free of magnetic fields. The overall magnetic activity of Epsilon Eridani shows co-existing and year activity cycles. Assuming that its radius does not change over these intervals, the long-term variation in activity level appears to produce a temperature variation of 15 K, which corresponds to a variation in <a href="UBV%20photometric%20system">visual magnitude</a> (V) of 0.014.

The magnetic field on the surface of Epsilon Eridani causes variations in the <a href="hydrodynamic">hydrodynamic</a> behaviour of the photosphere. This results in greater <a href="jitter">jitter</a> during <a href="Doppler%20spectroscopy">measurements of its radial velocity</a>. Variations of were measured over a 20 year period, which is much higher than the <a href="measurement%20uncertainty">measurement uncertainty</a> of . This makes interpretation of periodicities in the radial velocity of Epsilon Eridani, such as those caused by an orbiting planet, more difficult.

Epsilon Eridani is classified as a <a href="BY%20Draconis%20variable">BY Draconis variable</a> because it has regions of higher magnetic activity that move into and out of the line of sight as it rotates. Measurement of this <a href="rotational%20modulation">rotational modulation</a> suggests that its equatorial region rotates with an average period of 11.2 days, which is less than half of the rotation period of the Sun. Observations have shown that Epsilon Eridani varies as much as 0.050 in V magnitude due to <a href="starspot">starspot</a>s and other short-term magnetic activity. <a href="Photometry%20%28astronomy%29">Photometry</a> has also shown that the surface of Epsilon Eridani, like the Sun, is undergoing <a href="differential%20rotation">differential rotation</a> i.e. the rotation period at equator differs from that at high <a href="latitude">latitude</a>. The measured periods range from 10.8 to 12.3 days. The <a href="axial%20tilt">axial tilt</a> of Epsilon Eridani toward the line of sight from Earth is highly uncertain: estimates range from 24° to 72°.

The high levels of chromospheric activity, strong magnetic field, and relatively fast rotation rate of Epsilon Eridani are characteristic of a young star. Most estimates of the age of Epsilon Eridani place it in the range from 200 million to 800 million years. The low abundance of heavy elements in the chromosphere of Epsilon Eridani usually indicates an older star, because the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a> (out of which stars form) is steadily enriched by heavier elements produced by older generations of stars. This anomaly might be caused by a <a href="diffusion">diffusion</a> process that has transported some of the heavier elements out of the photosphere and into a region below Epsilon Eridani's <a href="convection%20zone">convection zone</a>.

The <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> luminosity of Epsilon Eridani is about (). It is more luminous in X-rays than the Sun at <a href="Solar%20cycle">peak activity</a>. The source for this strong X-ray emission is Epsilon Eridani's hot corona. Epsilon Eridani's corona appears larger and hotter than the Sun's, with a temperature of , measured from observation of the corona's ultraviolet and X-ray emission.

The <a href="stellar%20wind">stellar wind</a> emitted by Epsilon Eridani expands until it collides with the surrounding <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a> of diffuse gas and dust, resulting in a bubble of heated hydrogen gas (an <a href="astrosphere">astrosphere</a>, the equivalent of the <a href="heliosphere">heliosphere</a> that surrounds the Sun). The <a href="absorption%20spectrum">absorption spectrum</a> from this gas has been measured with the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, allowing the properties of the stellar wind to be estimated. Epsilon Eridani's hot corona results in a mass loss rate in Epsilon Eridani's stellar wind that is 30 times higher than the Sun's. This stellar wind generates the astrosphere that spans about and contains a <a href="bow%20shock">bow shock</a> that lies from Epsilon Eridani. At its estimated distance from Earth, this astrosphere spans 42 arcminutes, which is wider than the apparent size of the full Moon.

Epsilon Eridani has a high <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a>, moving −0.976 arcseconds per year in <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> (the celestial equivalent of longitude) and 0.018 arcseconds per year in <a href="declination">declination</a> (celestial latitude), for a combined total of 0.962 arcseconds per year. The star has a radial velocity of (away from the Sun). The <a href="space%20velocity%20%28astronomy%29">space velocity</a> components of Epsilon Eridani in the <a href="galactic%20coordinate%20system">galactic co-ordinate system</a> are = , which means that it is travelling within the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> at a mean <a href="galactocentric%20distance">galactocentric distance</a> of 28.7 kly (8.79 kiloparsecs) from the core along an orbit that has an <a href="orbital%20eccentricity">eccentricity</a> of 0.09. The <a href="Stellar%20kinematics">velocity and heading</a> of Epsilon Eridani indicate that it may be a member of the <a href="Ursa%20Major%20Moving%20Group">Ursa Major Moving Group</a>, whose members share a common motion through space. This behaviour suggests that the moving group originated in an <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> that has since diffused. The estimated age of this group is years, which lies within the range of the age estimates for Epsilon Eridani.

During the past million years, three stars are believed to have come within of Epsilon Eridani. The most recent and closest of these encounters was with <a href="Kapteyn%27s%20Star">Kapteyn's Star</a>, which approached to a distance of about roughly 12,500 years ago. Two more distant encounters were with <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a> and <a href="Ross%20614">Ross 614</a>. None of these encounters are thought to have been close enough to affect the circumstellar disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani.

Epsilon Eridani made its closest approach to the Sun about 105,000 years ago, when they were separated by . Based upon a simulation of close encounters with nearby stars, the binary star system <a href="Luyten%20726-8">Luyten 726-8</a>, which includes the <a href="variable%20star">variable star</a> <a href="UV%20Ceti">UV Ceti</a>, will encounter Epsilon Eridani in approximately 31,500 years at a minimum distance of about 0.9 ly (0.29 parsecs). They will be less than 1 ly (0.3 parsecs) apart for about 4,600 years. If Epsilon Eridani has an <a href="Oort%20cloud">Oort cloud</a>, Luyten 726-8 could gravitationally <a href="Perturbation%20%28astronomy%29">perturb</a> some of its <a href="Exocomet">comets</a> with long <a href="orbital%20period">orbital period</a>s.

Observations with the <a href="James%20Clerk%20Maxwell%20Telescope">James Clerk Maxwell Telescope</a> at a <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> of 850 μm show an extended flux of radiation out to an <a href="Angular%20diameter">angular radius</a> of 35 arcseconds around Epsilon Eridani. The peak emission occurs at an angular radius of 18 arcseconds, which corresponds to a radius of about 60 AU. The highest level of emission occurs over the radius 35–75 AU from Epsilon Eridani and is substantially reduced inside 30 AU. This emission is interpreted as coming from a young analogue of the Solar System's <a href="Kuiper%20belt">Kuiper belt</a>: a compact dusty disk structure surrounding Epsilon Eridani. From Earth, this belt is viewed at an inclination of roughly 25° to the line of sight.

Dust and possibly water ice from this belt migrates inward because of drag from the stellar wind and a process by which stellar radiation causes dust grains to slowly spiral toward Epsilon Eridani, known as the <a href="Poynting%E2%80%93Robertson%20effect">Poynting–Robertson effect</a>. At the same time, these dust particles can be destroyed through mutual collisions. The time scale for all of the dust in the disk to be cleared away by these processes is less than Epsilon Eridani's estimated age. Hence, the current dust disk must have been created by collisions or other effects of larger parent bodies, and the disk represents a late stage in the planet-formation process. It would have required collisions between 11 Earth masses' worth of parent bodies to have maintained the disk in its current state over its estimated age.

The disk contains an estimated mass of dust equal to a sixth of the mass of the Moon, with individual dust grains exceeding 3.5 μm in size at a temperature of about 55 K. This dust is being generated by the collision of comets, which range up to 10 to 30 km in diameter and have a combined mass of 5 to 9 times that of Earth. This is similar to the estimated 10 Earth masses in the primordial Kuiper belt. The disk around Epsilon Eridani contains less than of <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a>. This low level suggests a paucity of volatile-bearing comets and icy <a href="planetesimal">planetesimal</a>s compared to the Kuiper belt.

The clumpy structure of the dust belt may be explained by gravitational perturbation from a planet, dubbed Epsilon Eridani b. The clumps in the dust occur at orbits that have an integer resonance with the orbit of the suspected planet. For example, the region of the disk that completes two orbits for every three orbits of a planet is in a 3:2 <a href="orbital%20resonance">orbital resonance</a>. In computer simulations the ring morphology can be reproduced by the capture of dust particles in 5:3 and 3:2 orbital resonances with a planet that has an <a href="orbital%20eccentricity">orbital eccentricity</a> of about 0.3. Alternatively, the clumpiness may have been caused by collisions between <a href="minor%20planet">minor planet</a>s known as <a href="plutino">plutino</a>s.

Observations from NASA's <a href="Spitzer%20Space%20Telescope">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> suggest that Epsilon Eridani actually has two asteroid belts and a cloud of <a href="exozodiacal%20dust">exozodiacal dust</a>. The latter is an analogue of the <a href="zodiacal%20dust">zodiacal dust</a> that occupies the plane of the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>. One belt sits at approximately the same position as the one in the Solar System, orbiting at a distance of from Epsilon Eridani, and consists of <a href="silicate">silicate</a> grains with a diameter of 3 <a href="Micrometre">μm</a> and a combined mass of about 10 kg. If the planet Epsilon Eridani b exists then this belt is unlikely to have had a source outside the orbit of the planet, so the dust may have been created by fragmentation and cratering of larger bodies such as <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>s. The second, denser belt, most likely also populated by asteroids, lies between the first belt and the outer comet disk. The structure of the belts and the dust disk suggests that more than two planets in the Epsilon Eridani system are needed to maintain this configuration.

In an alternative scenario, the exozodiacal dust may be generated in an outer belt that is orbiting between 55 and 90 AU from Epsilon Eridani and has an assumed mass of 10 times the mass of Earth. This dust is then transported inward past the orbit of Epsilon Eridani b. When collisions between the dust grains are taken into account, the dust will reproduce the observed infrared spectrum and brightness. Outside the radius of ice <a href="Sublimation%20%28phase%20transition%29">sublimation</a>, located beyond 10 AU from Epsilon Eridani where the temperatures fall below 100 K, the best fit to the observations occurs when a mix of ice and <a href="silicate">silicate</a> dust is assumed. Inside this radius, the dust must consist of silicate grains that lack <a href="volatiles">volatiles</a>.

The inner region around Epsilon Eridani, from a radius of 2.5 AU inward, appears to be clear of dust down to the detection limit of the 6.5 m <a href="MMT%20Observatory">MMT telescope</a>. Grains of dust in this region are efficiently removed by drag from the stellar wind, while the presence of a planetary system may also help keep this area clear of debris. Still, this does not preclude the possibility that an inner asteroid belt may be present with a combined mass no greater than the asteroid belt in the Solar System.

As one of the nearest Sun-like stars, Epsilon Eridani has been the target of many attempts to search for planetary companions. Its chromospheric activity and variability mean that finding planets with the <a href="Methods%20of%20detecting%20extrasolar%20planets%23Radial%20velocity">radial velocity method</a> is difficult, because the stellar activity may create signals that mimic the presence of planets. Attempts at direct imaging of potential exoplanets have proven unsuccessful to date.

Infrared observation has shown there are no bodies of three or more <a href="Jupiter%20mass">Jupiter mass</a>es in this system, out to at least a distance of 500 AU from the host star. Planets with similar masses and temperatures as Jupiter should be detectable by Spitzer at distances beyond 80 AU, but none has been discovered in this range. Planets more than 150% as massive as Jupiter can be ruled out at the inner edge of the debris disk at 30–35 AU.

<a href="Extrasolar%20planet%23Nomenclature">Referred to</a> as <a href="Epsilon%20Eridani%20b">Epsilon Eridani b</a>, this planet was announced in 2000, but the discovery has remained controversial. A comprehensive study in 2008 called the detection "tentative" and described the proposed planet as "long suspected but still unconfirmed". Many astronomers believed the evidence is sufficiently compelling that they regard the discovery as confirmed. As of 2013, the discovery remains in doubt because a search program at <a href="La%20Silla%20Observatory">La Silla Observatory</a> did not confirm it exists.

Published sources remain in disagreement as to the proposed planet's basic parameters. Values for its orbital period range from 6.85 to 7.2 years. Estimates of the size of its elliptical orbit—the <a href="semimajor%20axis">semimajor axis</a>—range from 3.38 AU to 3.50 AU and approximations of its <a href="orbital%20eccentricity">orbital eccentricity</a> range from to .

The true mass of this planet remains unknown, but it can be estimated based on the displacement effect of the planet's gravity on Epsilon Eridani. Only the component of the displacement along the line of sight to Earth is known, which yields a value for the formula <a href="Stellar%20rotation%23Measurement">"m" sin "i"</a>, where "m" is the mass of the planet and "i" is the <a href="orbital%20inclination">orbital inclination</a>. Estimates for the value of range from 0.60 <a href="Jupiter%20mass">Jupiter mass</a>es to 1.06 Jupiter masses, which sets the lower limit for the mass of the planet (because the <a href="sine">sine</a> function has a maximum value of 1). Taking in the middle of that range at 0.78, and estimating the inclination at 30°, this yields the frequently cited value of Jupiter masses for the planet's mass.

Of all the measured parameters for this planet, the value for orbital eccentricity is the most uncertain. The frequently cited value of 0.7 for Epsilon Eridani b's eccentricity is inconsistent with the presence of the proposed asteroid belt at a distance of 3 AU. If the eccentricity was actually this high, the planet would pass through the asteroid belt and clear it out within about ten thousand years. If the belt has existed for longer than this period, which appears likely, it imposes an upper limit on Epsilon Eridani b's eccentricity of about 0.10–0.15. If the dust disk is instead being generated from the outer debris disk, rather than from collisions in an asteroid belt, then no constraints on the planet's orbital eccentricity are needed to explain the dust distribution.

Computer simulations of the dusty disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani suggest that the shape of the disk may be explained by the presence of a second planet, tentatively dubbed Epsilon Eridani c. Clumping in the dust disk may occur because dust particles are being trapped in orbits that have <a href="Orbital%20resonance">resonant</a> orbital periods with a planet in an eccentric orbit. The postulated Epsilon Eridani c would orbit at a distance of 40 AU, with an eccentricity of 0.3 and a period of 280 years. The inner cavity of the disk may be explained by the presence of additional planets. Current models of planet formation cannot easily explain how a planet could have been created at this distance from Epsilon Eridani. The disk is expected to have dissipated long before a giant planet could have formed. Instead, the planet may have formed at an orbital distance of about 10 AU, then migrated outward because of gravitational interaction with the disc or with other planets in the system.

Epsilon Eridani is a target for planet finding programs because it has properties that allow an Earth-like planet to form. Although this system was not chosen as a primary candidate for the now-canceled <a href="Terrestrial%20Planet%20Finder">Terrestrial Planet Finder</a>, it was a target star for NASA's proposed <a href="Space%20Interferometry%20Mission">Space Interferometry Mission</a> to search for Earth-sized planets. The proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets of Epsilon Eridani have also made it the subject of multiple studies on whether an <a href="interstellar%20probe">interstellar probe</a> can be sent to Epsilon Eridani.

The orbital radius at which the stellar flux from Epsilon Eridani matches the <a href="solar%20constant">solar constant</a>—where the emission matches the Sun's output at the orbital distance of the Earth—is 0.61 astronomical units (AU). That is within the maximum <a href="habitable%20zone">habitable zone</a> of a conjectured Earth-like planet orbiting Epsilon Eridani, which currently stretches from about 0.5 to 1.0 AU. As Epsilon Eridani ages over a period of 20 billion years, the net luminosity will increase, causing this zone to slowly expand outward to about 0.6–1.4 AU. The presence of a large planet with a highly <a href="elliptical%20orbit">elliptical orbit</a> in proximity to Epsilon Eridani's habitable zone reduces the likelihood of a <a href="terrestrial%20planet">terrestrial planet</a> having a stable orbit within the habitable zone.

A young star such as Epsilon Eridani can produce large amounts of <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> radiation that may be harmful to life. The orbital radius where the UV flux matches that on the early Earth lies at just under 0.5 AU. Epsilon Eridani's proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets have made it a destination for <a href="interstellar%20travel">interstellar travel</a> in <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> stories.

From Epsilon Eridani, the Sun would appear as a 2.4-magnitude star in <a href="Serpens">Serpens</a>.

Antiochus XII Dionysus

Antiochus XII Dionysus Epiphanes Philopator Callinicus (; between 125 and 109 BC – 82 BC) was a <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic</a> <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid</a> monarch who reigned as <a href="List%20of%20Syrian%20monarchs">King of Syria</a> between 87 and 82BC. The youngest son of <a href="Antiochus%20VIII%20Grypus">Antiochus VIII</a> and, most likely, his Egyptian wife <a href="Tryphaena">Tryphaena</a>. Antiochus XII lived during a period of civil war between his father and his uncle <a href="Antiochus%20IX%20Cyzicenus">Antiochus IX</a>, which ended with the assassination of Antiochus VIII in 96BC. Antiochus XII's four brothers laid claim to the throne, eliminated Antiochus IX as a claimant, and waged war against his heir <a href="Antiochus%20X%20Eusebes">Antiochus X</a>.

By 87 BC, only two claimants remained, both brothers of Antiochus XII: <a href="Demetrius%20III%20Eucaerus">Demetrius III</a> and <a href="Philip%20I%20Philadelphus">Philip I</a>. The realm of Demetrius III was initially centered in Damascus but later extended over most of Syria. Demetrius III was defeated by Philip I and went into exile in <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthia</a>, allowing Antiochus XII to gain control of Damascus while Philip I remained in the Syrian capital <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>. Antiochus XII consolidated his territory within inner Syria and did not seek to expand into the territories of Philip I, who attempted to annex Damascus but was repulsed. Antiochus XII focused his attention on Syria's southern reaches into which the <a href="Hasmonean%20dynasty">Judaeans</a> and <a href="Nabataeans">Nabataeans</a> sought to expand.

Antiochus XII reinforced his southern frontier and warred with his neighbors, conducting two campaigns against Nabataea that included engagements with Judea. After several victories in his first campaign, Antiochus XII was killed towards the end of his second campaign against the Nabateans at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cana">Battle of Cana</a> in 82 BC. Damascus was captured by the forces of the Nabatean King <a href="Aretas%20III">Aretas III</a>, and the Syrian throne was claimed by Antiochus X's widow <a href="Cleopatra%20Selene%20of%20Syria">Cleopatra Selene</a> and her son <a href="Antiochus%20XIII%20Asiaticus">Antiochus XIII</a>.

Antiochus, Greek for "resolute in contention", was a dynastic name borne by many <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid</a> monarchs. The Seleucid dynasty's founder <a href="Seleucus%20I%20Nicator">Seleucus I</a> named the capital of Syria, <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>, in honor of his father <a href="Antiochus%20%28father%20of%20Seleucus%20I%20Nicator%29">Antiochus</a>. Antiochus XII was the fifth and youngest son of <a href="Antiochus%20VIII%20Grypus">Antiochus VIII</a> and his <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic</a> Egyptian wife <a href="Tryphaena">Tryphaena</a>; his brothers were <a href="Seleucus%20VI%20Epiphanes">Seleucus VI</a>, <a href="Antiochus%20XI%20Epiphanes">Antiochus XI</a>, <a href="Philip%20I%20Philadelphus">Philip I</a> and <a href="Demetrius%20III%20Eucaerus">Demetrius III</a>. They were born between 125 BC, the wedding year of their parents, and 109 BC, when Tryphaena was killed by Antiochus VIII's half-brother <a href="Antiochus%20IX%20Cyzicenus">Antiochus IX</a>, who fought with Antiochus VIII from 113 BC for the throne of Syria.

Following Antiochus VIII's assassination in 96 BC, his second wife, Tryphaena's sister <a href="Cleopatra%20Selene%20of%20Syria">Cleopatra Selene</a>, married Antiochus IX and then his son <a href="Antiochus%20X%20Eusebes">Antiochus X</a>, who fought with Antiochus XII's four brothers for the throne. By 88 BC, only Demetrius III and Philip I remained; Demetrius III was originally based in <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a> before extending his authority to most of Syria. He was defeated by Philip I and his <a href="Parthia">Parthia</a>n allies in 87 BC and exiled to <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthia</a>, where he died of an unknown illness. Philip I took control of the capital, while Cleopatra Selene, now a widow, took shelter in <a href="Ptolemais%20in%20Phoenicia">Ptolemais</a> with her sons by Antiochus X.

The departure of Demetrius III left a power vacuum in Damascus that was filled by Antiochus XII. Coins minted during the reign of Demetrius III are dated to the <a href="Seleucid%20era">Seleucid year (SE)</a> 225 (88/87 BC), while the earliest coins minted during the reign of Antiochus XII have the date 226 SE (87/86 BC), suggesting that there was a rapid assumption of power by Antiochus XII. Monarchs of the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic period</a> did not use <a href="regnal%20number">regnal number</a>s, which is a more modern practice, but instead used epithets to distinguish themselves from similarly named monarchs; Three of Antiochus XII's four epithets, "Epiphanes" (illustrious)–previously used by his father, "Philopator" (father-loving) and "Callinicus" (nobly victorious), served to emphasize the ancestry of his grandfather <a href="Demetrius%20II%20Nicator">Demetrius II</a> in contrast to the line of the latter's brother <a href="Antiochus%20VII%20Sidetes">Antiochus VII</a>, which was represented by Antiochus IX and his descendants; "Callinicus" may have been an echo of Demetrius II's epithet "Nikator" (victorious). He likely used his other epithet "Dionysus" to associate himself with the <a href="Dionysus">Greek god of wine</a> in his role as conqueror of the East. Antiochus XII was depicted on coinage with an exaggerated hawked nose in the likeness of his father, as a means of strengthening the legitimacy of his succession.

According to historian <a href="Alfred%20Bellinger">Alfred Bellinger</a>, Antiochus XII may have received assistance from <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic Egypt</a> to gain his throne. This view is reflected in Antiochus XII's policies, which were targeted at the south in Nabataea and Judaea, but not towards expansion within the kingdom of Syria. His dominion was limited to inner Syria, centered on Damascus, which served as his capital and primary <a href="Mint%20%28facility%29">mint</a>. Antiochus XII also ruled over the town of <a href="Umm%20Qais">Gadara</a>, governed by an official named Philotas. In 100 BC, Gadara had been conquered by the <a href="Hasmonean%20dynasty">Hasmonean</a> king of <a href="Judea">Judea</a> <a href="Alexander%20Jannaeus">Alexander Jannaeus</a>, who partially destroyed its walls, but it was recaptured by the Seleucids in 93 BC. Gadara held great strategic importance for Syria as it served as a major military hub for operations in the south. Controlling it was vital to the war effort against the Judaeans, which led Antiochus to rebuild the city's defenses in 228 SE (85/84 BC). Historian <a href="Aryeh%20Kasher">Aryeh Kasher</a> suggested that Antiochus XII dug what the first-century historian <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a> called the "trench of Antiochus" (or valley of Antiochus) to protect Damascus from the <a href="Nabataeans">Nabataeans</a>; the trench was probably located in the <a href="Hula%20Valley">Hula Valley</a>.

Seleucid coins often had depictions of their Greek deities, but the silver coinage of Antiochus XII depicted the supreme Semitic god <a href="Hadad">Hadad</a> on the reverse, possibly in recognition of the shrinking borders of the kingdom, which convinced the monarch of the importance of the local cults. By promoting indigenous deities, Seleucid kings hoped to gain the support of their non-Greek subjects. According to Bellinger, the use of Hadad indicated that Antiochus XII placed focus on his "intention of being first and foremost king of Damascus". During his reign, Demetrius III had also depicted a Semitic deity, <a href="Atargatis">Atargatis</a>, on his currency. In the view of historian , The change of coin imagery from Atargatis to Hadad probably served two goals: to imply that Antiochus XII had a different policy focus than his predecessor, and to demonstrate his intention of maintaining a good relationship with the Semitic population of Damascus, who comprised the majority of the inhabitants, to avoid tension with Greek settlers. Seleucid kings presented themselves as protectors of <a href="Hellenistic%20period%23Culture">Hellenism</a> and patronized intellectuals and philosophers, but Antiochus XII may have adopted a different attitude; he ordered the expulsion of such scholars.

Early in his reign, Antiochus XII attacked the Nabataeans and the Judaeans, whose territories both lay to the south of his own. This conflict was recorded by Josephus, although he made no mention of the name of the Nabataean king. Josephus mentioned two campaigns against the Nabataeans, but did not explain the motives leading the Syrian King to attack them. Modern scholars presented several theories. In the view of Israel Shatzman, Antiochus XII may have feared the growing power of the Nabataeans, who were expanding into southern Syria. Zayn Bilkadi suggested that Antiochus XII wanted to take control over the Nabataeans' <a href="Petroleum">crude oil</a> industry, while Alexander Fantalkin and Oren Tal suggested that the Nabataeans actively supported Philip I in his attempts to take control over Antiochus XII's realm.

Antiochus XII's first Nabataean campaign was launched in 87 BC, and might have included a battle near Motho, modern <a href="Imtan">Imtan</a> in the region of Hauran, as proposed by historian Hans Peter Roschinski, who drew on the writings of <a href="Stephanus%20of%20Byzantium">Stephanus of Byzantium</a>. The Byzantine historian preserved in his book, "Ethica", fragments from a lost work by historian Uranius of Apamea, who wrote a book titled "Arabica", which has been dated to 300 AD. In the account of Uranius, King <a href="Antigonus%20I%20Monophthalmus">Antigonus I</a> ( BC) is killed at Motho by a king of the Arabs named Rabbel. The name Motho could refer to a northern city in <a href="Hauran">Hauran</a> or a southern city in <a href="Moab">Moab</a>. The name of Antigonus was regularly "corrected" to Antiochus by different scholars who believed that Uranius was referring to Antiochus XII. Historian <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Milik">Józef Milik</a> rejected the practice of correcting Uranius' work. Antigonus I was actually killed in 301 BC at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ipsus">Battle of Ipsus</a>; Milik believed that instead of Antigonus I or Antiochus XII, the passage refers to <a href="Antigonid%E2%80%93Nabataean%20confrontations">Athenaeus</a>, an official of Antigonus who fought the Nabataeans. Roschinski considered it conceivable that Stephanus was conflating two events taking place during the reign of the Nabataean King Rabbel I: a battle of the first Nabataean campaign at Motho in the north, and the battle from the second Nabataean campaign in which Antiochus XII was killed. Shatzman, on the other hand, noted that nowhere in his work did Stephanus indicate that the battle of Motho took place in the north.

Taking advantage of his brother's absence, Philip I seized Damascus, aided by the governor of the city's citadel, Milesius, who opened the gates to him. According to Josephus, Milesius received no reward from Philip I, who attributed the betrayal to the general's fear, leading Milesius to betray Philip I, who had left the city to attend an event in the nearby <a href="hippodrome">hippodrome</a>. The general closed the gates, locking Philip I out, and awaited the return of Antiochus XII, who had hastily ended his campaign when he heard of his brother's occupation of the city. Modern scholars noted that Seleucid currency, struck during campaigns against a rival (or usurper), portrayed the King sporting a beard. During his first two years, Antiochus XII's visage appeared beardless, but this changed in 228 SE (85/84 BC). This is possibly related to Philip I's attack on Damascus, but this supposition has little support, as Antiochus XII failed to take any action against his brother. No coins were minted during the period that Philip I held Damascus, indicating only a brief occupation of the city.

Although his territory directly abutted Nabataean territory, for his second Nabataean campaign Antiochus XII instead chose to march his forces through Judaea along the coast, probably to attack the Nabataean-dominated <a href="Negev">Negev</a>, which would have cut off the port city of <a href="Gaza%20City">Gaza</a>, threatened Nabataean Mediterranean trade, and curbed Nabataean ambitions in the <a href="Transjordan%20%28region%29">Transjordan</a>. This route would have allowed Antiochus XII to keep Alexander Jannaeus at bay. According to Josephus, the Judaean King feared Antiochus XII's intentions and ordered the "Yannai Line" to be built, which consisted of a trench that fronted a defensive wall dotted with wooden towers. The trench stretched from <a href="Kfar%20Saba">Caphersaba</a> to the sea near <a href="Jaffa">Joppa</a>. Antiochus XII leveled the trench, burned the fortifications, and continued his march into Nabataean territory.

The account of the campaign, written by Josephus, is subject to some debate; the historian wrote that Antiochus XII's forces defeated those of Alexander Jannaeus, but the eighth-century historian <a href="George%20Syncellus">George Syncellus</a> mentioned a defeat suffered by Antiochus XII at the hands of the Judaean king. The existence of the Yannai Line has been questioned by several historians, and Josephus' explanation of Alexander Jannaeus' attempt to stop the march of Antiochus XII, because of his fears of the latter's intentions, is unsatisfactory. Both the Nabataeans and Syrians were enemies of Judea and it would have been to Alexander Jannaeus' benefit if those two powers were in conflict. Syncellus may have been referring to an earlier confrontation between the Syrian king and Alexander Jannaeus. Thus the statement of Syncellus supports the notion that Antiochus XII's second Nabataean campaign was also aimed at Judea; perhaps Antiochus XII sought to annex the coastal cities of Alexander Jannaeus as a retribution for the defeat mentioned by Syncellus. Another objective would be subduing the Judaeans to keep them from attacking Syria while Antiochus XII was busy in Nabataea.

The final engagement between the forces of Antiochus XII and the Nabataeans occurred near the village of <a href="Battle%20of%20Cana">Cana</a>, the location of which is unknown, but is generally assumed by modern scholars to be southwest of the <a href="Dead%20Sea">Dead Sea</a>. Historian Siegfried Mittmann considered it to be synonymous with "Qina", modern-day <a href="Horvat%20Uza">Horvat Uza</a>, as mentioned by Josephus in Book 15 of his "Antiquities". Details of the battle, as written by Josephus, spoke of the Nabataeans employing a <a href="feigned%20retreat">feigned retreat</a>, then counterattacking the Syrian forces before their ranks could be ordered. Antiochus XII managed to rally his troops and weathered the attack, but he fought in the front lines, jeopardizing his life, and he eventually fell. The year of Antiochus XII's death is debated, but his last coins struck in Damascus are dated to 230 SE (83/82 BC).

According to Josephus, the death of the King resulted in a rout of the Syrian forces, with many being killed in the field or during the retreat. Survivors of the rout sheltered in Cana, where most died of starvation. Antiochus XII was the last energetic Seleucid king. Little is recorded of Philip I after his attempt at annexing Damascus, which was left without a protector after the death of Antiochus XII. Fearing the <a href="Iturea">Ituraean</a> ruler, <a href="Ptolemy%20%28son%20of%20Mennaeus%29">Ptolemy</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Chalcis">Chalcis</a>, the people of Damascus invited <a href="Aretas%20III">Aretas III</a> of Nabataea to take the city. The numismatist Oliver D. Hoover suggested that Aretas III did not hold Damascus for long before the city returned to Seleucid possession.

The identity of Antiochus XII's wife remains unknown, but according to the sixth-century historian <a href="John%20Malalas">John Malalas</a>, whose work is considered generally unreliable by scholars, the King had two daughters, Cleopatra and Antiochis. Cleopatra Selene, who went into hiding after the death of Antiochus X in 224 SE (89/88 BC), took advantage of Antiochus XII's death and declared her son <a href="Antiochus%20XIII%20Asiaticus">Antiochus XIII</a> king with herself as queen regent and regnant. Coins struck during her regency show the marks of the Damascus mint. Archeologist Nicholas L. Wright suggested that Cleopatra Selene's takeover of Damascus took place after 80 BC. Josephus called Antiochus XII the last Seleucid king, and Malalas, according to the translation of the historian Glanville Downey, followed suit; the last Seleucid king was in fact Antiochus XIII, who was dethroned in 64 BC after Antioch was annexed by the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Romans</a>.

Stanley Bruce

Stanley Melbourne Bruce, 1st Viscount Bruce of Melbourne, (15 April 1883 – 25 August 1967) was the eighth <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a>, in office from 1923 to 1929. He made wide-ranging reforms and mounted a comprehensive nation-building program in government, but his controversial handling of industrial relations led to a dramatic <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201929">defeat at the polls in 1929</a>. Bruce later pursued a long and influential diplomatic career as <a href="List%20of%20High%20Commissioners%20of%20Australia%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom">High Commissioner to the United Kingdom</a> (1933–1945) and chairman of the <a href="Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> (1946–1951).

Born into a wealthy <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> family, Bruce studied at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> and spent his early life tending to the importing and exporting business of his late father. He served on the front lines of the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a> in World War I and returned to Australia wounded in 1917, becoming a spokesperson for government recruitment efforts. He gained the attention of the <a href="Nationalist%20Party%20of%20Australia">Nationalist Party</a> and Prime Minister <a href="Billy%20Hughes">Billy Hughes</a>, who encouraged a political career. He was elected to <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">parliament</a> in 1918, becoming <a href="Treasurer%20of%20Australia">treasurer</a> in 1921 and then prime minister in 1923, at the head of a coalition with the <a href="National%20Party%20of%20Australia">Country Party</a>.

In office Bruce pursued an energetic and diverse agenda. He comprehensively overhauled federal government administration and oversaw its transfer to the new capital city of <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>. He implemented various reforms to the <a href="Federalism%20in%20Australia">Australian federal system</a> to strengthen the role of the Commonwealth, and helped develop the forerunners of the <a href="Australian%20Federal%20Police">Australian Federal Police</a> and the <a href="CSIRO">CSIRO</a>. Bruce's "men, money and markets" scheme was an ambitious attempt to rapidly expand Australia's population and economic potential through massive government investment and closer ties with Great Britain and the rest of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. However, his endeavours to overhaul Australia's industrial relations system brought his government into frequent conflict with the labour movement, and his radical proposal to abolish <a href="Commonwealth%20Court%20of%20Conciliation%20and%20Arbitration">Commonwealth arbitration</a> in 1929 prompted members of his own party to <a href="crossing%20the%20floor">cross the floor</a> to defeat the government. In the resounding loss at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201929">subsequent election</a> the prime minister lost his own seat, an event unprecedented in Australia and one that would not occur again until <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202007">2007</a>.

Although he returned to parliament in 1931, Bruce's service in the <a href="Lyons%20Government">Lyons Government</a> was brief. Instead he pursued an international career, accepting appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom in 1933. Bruce became an influential figure in British government circles and at the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>, emerging as a tireless advocate for international cooperation on economic and social problems, especially those facing the <a href="developing%20world">developing world</a>. Particularly passionate on improving global nutrition, Bruce was one of the key figures in the establishment of the Food and Agriculture Organization, serving as the first chairman of its governing council. He was the first Australian to sit in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>, as well as the first Chancellor of the <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a>. Although his diplomatic career went largely unnoticed in Australia, he continued throughout his life in London to vociferously advocate for Australian interests (particularly during World War II) and asked that his remains be returned to Canberra when he died in 1967.

Stanley Melbourne Bruce was born on 15 April 1883 in <a href="St%20Kilda%2C%20Victoria">St Kilda, Victoria</a>, a suburb of Melbourne, and was the youngest of five children. His father, John Munro Bruce, was of <a href="Ulster%20Scots%20people">Ulster Scottish</a> descent and had emigrated from Ireland to Australia in 1858 at the age of 18. His mother, Mary Ann Henderson, was Irish and had married her cousin John after emigrating to Australia in 1872 at the age of 24. John Bruce became a talented businessman with "a flair for buying and selling", which would secure him a partnership in an established Melbourne importing firm that in 1868 became known as Paterson, Laing and Bruce. As his wealth grew, John Bruce became influential in colonial Victoria's social and political life. An avid golfer, he was one of the founders of the <a href="Royal%20Melbourne%20Golf%20Club">Royal Melbourne Golf Club</a>. He was prominent in the <a href="Protectionist%20Party">liberal protectionist</a> political movement within the state and an early supporter of future prime minister <a href="Alfred%20Deakin">Alfred Deakin</a>. John Bruce's success ensured that Stanley Bruce, his sister Mary and his brothers Ernest, William and Robert were born into affluence. Shortly after Stanley Bruce's birth the family relocated to the stately Wombalano manor, built by John Bruce, in <a href="Toorak%2C%20Victoria">Toorak</a>. However, John Bruce was an aloof and remote figure in the lives of his children, as his son Stanley later recounted. Despite their family's <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> back-ground, Stanley Bruce was sent to Melbourne Church of England Grammar School (now <a href="Melbourne%20Grammar%20School">Melbourne Grammar School</a>) and subsequently Stanley Bruce would come to identify principally as <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a>. Bruce was an average student but extremely active in the sporting life of the school and captain of its <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">football</a> team, and then of the school itself in 1901. Today, the school honours him with his own house, Bruce House, the colours of which are magenta and white. The house's mascot is a lion, symbolising Bruce's bravery.

The economic depression of the 1880s and 1890s hit the Bruce family fortunes hard. John Bruce lost much of his fortune in the Victorian bank collapse of 1894 and incurred large debts to buy out his partners in the importing business in 1897. The family suffered a great deal more tragedy over the coming decades. Stanley's brother William committed suicide in 1899, shortly after seeking treatment for mental illness. Just two years later John Bruce took his own life during a business trip to Paris; he had suffered from depression as a result of the great pressures on his business and finances. His sister Mary endured a long illness before succumbing in 1908, and his mother died too in 1912. Finally, Bruce's beloved brother Ernest shot himself in 1919, suffering from physical and mental injuries sustained during his military service in World War I.
In the aftermath of his father's death in 1901, the family fortunes were at a low ebb and Bruce went into the family business after leaving high school. The young Bruce was ambitious and determined to get an education. With loaned money, he moved to the United Kingdom with his mother and sister and enrolled in <a href="Trinity%20Hall%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity Hall, Cambridge</a> in 1902. He was a popular if average student, heavily involved in the athletic life of the college, including as a member of the Cambridge rowing crew that won the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race">Boat Race</a> in 1904. Rowing remained one of his great passions, and he continued to coach crews (including several for the <a href="Henley%20Royal%20Regatta">Henley Royal Regatta</a>) and write on the subject for much of his life. Ernest Bruce had remained in Australia to take charge of the family's business interests. In 1906, he lobbied the directors of the company to have his brother Stanley take over the chairmanship of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, and was ultimately successful. Despite being just 23, he proved an able chairman, and with Stanley in London managing the exporting and financial interests, and Ernest managing the importation and sales operations in Melbourne, the financial fortunes of the business and the family rapidly recovered. During these years, Bruce also trained and worked as a solicitor and then as a <a href="barrister">barrister</a> in the London with the firm of <a href="Ashurst%20LLP">Ashurst, Morris, Crisp & Co</a>. His work for the firm took him to Mexico in 1908 and <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a> in 1912, which fostered an interest in international affairs.

By 1912 Bruce was a wealthy businessman and successful barrister, and it was in this year <a href="Ethel%20Bruce">Ethel Dunlop Anderson</a> traveled to England and was reacquainted with Bruce, whom she had known as a child. Aged 32, Ethel was of similar Scottish-Irish ancestry and hailed from a prominent <a href="Squatting%20%28pastoral%29">squatter</a> family of Victoria. She shared many of Bruce's interests, especially golf, and his political outlook. They married in July 1913 in a quiet ceremony. Theirs was a close-knit relationship they would have many acquaintances but a small circle of close friends, and their relationship was one of mutual devotion. But the death of all but one member of his immediate family in just over a decade, and the fact that the Bruces would bear no children of their own, deeply affected Bruce. His brother Ernest's daughter, Helen Bruce, came to play a large part in his life and was to become the main beneficiary of his Will but Bruce "was left with a sense of insecurity and melancholy".

Bruce returned briefly to Australia in 1914, swapping positions within the company with his brother Ernest. World War I broke out in August of that year. Bruce and his brothers sought to enlist in defence of the Empire, but all three of them would choose to serve in the British Army rather than the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a>. It was easier to obtain officer commissions in the British Army and the family had a close association with (and for many of them, long periods of residency in) Great Britain. Bruce enlisted and received a commission as <a href="Lieutenant%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">lieutenant</a> on 7 February 1915 and was attached to the <a href="Royal%20Fusiliers">2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers</a> in Egypt, which was then assigned to the <a href="British%2029th%20Division">British 29th Division</a>. The 29th subsequently joined operations in Turkey along with <a href="Australian%20and%20New%20Zealand%20Army%20Corps">Australian and New Zealand Army Corps</a> (ANZAC) troops that year under Sir <a href="Ian%20Standish%20Monteith%20Hamilton">Ian Hamilton</a>, commander of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Expeditionary%20Force">Mediterranean Expeditionary Force</a> (MEF). <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> had devised a strategy of capturing the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> from Turkey to allow naval access to Allied Russia. However <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">allied naval forces</a> were unable to secure passage through the narrow straits, and the MEF under Hamilton devised a plan to wrest control through amphibious landings. This was the beginning of the now infamous <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a>.

Bruce's regiment landed at <a href="Cape%20Helles">Cape Helles</a> in mid-1915, where he fully distinguished himself in the <a href="Trench%20warfare">construction of trenches</a> and as an able commander. His battalion suffered heavy casualties over the coming months, and Bruce himself was wounded on 3 June by a shot to the arm, though it was this injury that spared him from a major assault by his battalion on 4 June in which many of his peers perished. He later reflected that he must have been kept on earth for some purpose. He returned to the front lines and his division moved to the new front at <a href="Suvla%20Bay">Suvla Bay</a>, where it was involved in particularly heavy fighting and sustained trench warfare throughout August and September. Bruce received the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> and the <a href="Croix%20de%20Guerre">Croix de Guerre</a> for his service during these months, and rose to the rank of <a href="Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">captain</a> on 5 August. He was wounded again on 26 September, this time by a shot to the knee, which left him crippled for several years and forced him to return to England to recuperate, while the rest of his regiment were transferred to France after the abandonment of the Gallipoli campaign.

Although it had been the agreement before the war that Ernest would stay and manage Paterson, Laing and Bruce while his brothers were serving, Ernest Bruce decided to enlist in the British Army in 1915. Hence, in September 1916 Bruce sought to resign his commission and return to Australia to resume management of the family business. The <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> refused his request but granted him leave to return to Australia while recuperating from his injuries. As a decorated soldier on crutches with a gift for public speaking, he was enlisted to become a spokesperson for government recruitment in Australia. His success and popularity in this role brought the attention of the Nationalist League and then Prime Minister <a href="Billy%20Hughes">Billy Hughes</a>, who lobbied the British government on his behalf and succeeded in convincing the War Office to allow Bruce to relinquish his commission in June 1917.

Having served with many of his countrymen he returned to Australia with a renewed sense of pride and mission in the country of his birth. But having borne witness to the catastrophic loss of life in the Gallipoli Campaign and the death of most of his army comrades, as well as having suffered through the loss of most of his family, at age 34 Bruce was imbued with "a driving ambition to make something of a life which providence had spared".

Bruce's popularity as a speaker for government recruitment efforts also earned him the attention of the National Union of Victoria, an influential group of Melbourne businessmen who provided much of the financing for the federal <a href="Nationalist%20Party%20of%20Australia">Nationalist Party</a>. As Sir <a href="William%20Irvine%20%28Australian%20politician%29">William Irvine</a> had recently resigned from parliament to become <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20Victoria">Chief Justice of Victoria</a>, there was to be <a href="Flinders%20by-election%2C%201918">a by-election</a> for his seat of <a href="Division%20of%20Flinders">Flinders</a> in 1918, which the National Union asked Bruce to stand for. The Nationalist <a href="preselection">preselection</a> for the seat attracted many candidates, and <a href="Edward%20Fancourt%20Mitchell">Sir Edward Mitchell</a>, one of Australia's leading constitutional lawyers, was presumed to be the front runner. Mitchell proved to be a disappointing speaker, and Bruce won preselection with the help of the National Union. A deal arranged by acting Prime Minister <a href="William%20Watt%20%28Australian%20politician%29">William Watt</a> prevented the newly formed <a href="National%20Party%20of%20Australia">Country Party</a> from challenging Bruce in what was a partly rural seat, stretching from <a href="Dandenong">Dandenong</a> out into the rural areas south and east of Melbourne. In the by-election of 11 May, Bruce easily defeated his Labor opponent Gordon Holmes.

Speaking to the delegates in Dandenong, Bruce summed up his political philosophy:
A plain soldier and business man. I am no politician, nor have I any desire to be one. In the course of my commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. What I have seen in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by the vast majority of the population.
Bruce's early years in parliament were unremarkable and his energies were primarily focused on the affairs of Paterson, Laing and Bruce. However, in 1921 he attracted the attention of his parliamentary colleagues over the matter of the <a href="Commonwealth%20Line">Commonwealth Line</a>. Nationalist Prime Minister Billy Hughes, now a peace-time leader, had declined in popularity within the party due to his left-wing domestic policies. The Commonwealth Line had been created by the Hughes government as a state-owned concern to ship Australian goods during World War I when British and domestic commercial shipping were unavailable. However its post-war existence was extensively criticised by Bruce as inappropriate and inefficient, and many of his economically conservative colleagues agreed. Bruce also distinguished himself as one of Australia's two representatives to the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> in 1921 in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>, at which he passionately advocated for <a href="disarmament">disarmament</a> and greater international cooperation, despite his general scepticism with regards to the League's mission and potential for success. 

Returning from Europe in October 1921, he was invited by Prime Minister Billy Hughes to join his government as <a href="Minister%20for%20Trade%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Trade and Customs</a>. Bruce was not interested he was the head of one of Australia's largest importing houses and thus had a serious <a href="conflict%20of%20interest">conflict of interest</a> with the portfolio, as well as being very busy running the affairs of that business. But he countered by stating that he might feel obliged to accept if the position of <a href="Treasurer%20of%20Australia">Treasurer</a> was offered, knowing that it had already been promised to <a href="Walter%20Massy-Greene">Walter Massy-Greene</a>. To Bruce's surprise, Hughes agreed, although Massy Greene was to remain the number two in the government and <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Defence</a>. Although he had only been in parliament for three years, his business background was highly desirable to Hughes, who was facing growing criticism from the pro-business wing of the party, who had become increasingly suspicious of Hughes and his interventionist approach to the economy. Influential party figures such as Senator <a href="George%20Pearce">George Pearce</a> and the National Union has also identified Bruce as their preferred choice for the treasury.

Bruce and Hughes clashed in both style and ideology. Bruce found Hughes' management of the government capricious and chaotic, and felt little was accomplished in Cabinet or in party meetings so long as Hughes headed them. But he served as a strong counterweight to the domineering Hughes, resisting several of his more expensive proposals or acting as the voice of reason to talk Hughes down from several of his more outlandish ideas. His tenure would ultimately be short, presiding over just one budget in 1922, which was conservative and tax-cutting. The <a href="Opposition%20%28Australia%29">Opposition</a> criticised the budget for its failure to limit rising government spending and indebtedness. The budget included many concessions to rural interests and the recently formed Country Party, which appeared as a major threat to Nationalist Party dominance going into the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201922">1922 elections</a> in December. Yet Bruce endeared himself to many of his colleagues with his amiable personal style, his forceful voice in Cabinet against Hughes, and his conservative views, which were more in line with the majority of the party.

The Nationalists lost eleven seats and their majority in the <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> in the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201922">election of 1922</a>. Only three of these seats were picked up by the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labor Party</a> though, and Labor still lacked the numbers to form government in their own right. Rather, a breakaway anti-Hughes <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%281922%29">Liberal Party</a> took five government seats, while the Country Party increased their number to 14 and now held the balance of power. The only politically realistic option for the Nationalists to stay in office was to come to an agreement with the Country Party. However, Country Party leader <a href="Earle%20Page">Earle Page</a> refused to support a Nationalist government with Hughes as prime minister, and negotiations throughout January and February failed to break the impasse. Rather than risk being defeated in the legislature, which might have resulted in the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General</a> asking Labor to form government, Hughes surprised his colleagues by announcing his intention to resign on 2 February. With deputy leader <a href="Walter%20Massy-Greene">Walter Massy-Greene</a> having lost his seat at the 1922 election, Hughes now sent for Bruce to take over as leader of the party. After some reluctance, Bruce finally agreed, although Hughes later regretted the decision and became one of the new prime minister's most outspoken detractors.

Bruce moved quickly to secure a working majority for his government. He convinced Hughes' long time political ally George Pearce to join his ministry and shored up the support of the other former <a href="National%20Labor%20Party">National Labor</a> members of the Nationalist Party whom had walked out of the Labor Party with Hughes in 1916. He appointed William Watt as <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a>, effectively removing one of his key opponents from the benches, a tactical manoeuvre that became common in Australian politics thereafter. But his most lasting political achievement was the negotiation of what became known as the <a href="Coalition%20%28Australia%29">Coalition</a> an arrangement of electoral and political cooperation between the Nationalists (and their successors) and the Country Party. Although differing greatly in character and background, the orderly and diplomatic Bruce forged a strong working relationship with the intelligent but irascible Country Party leader Page. Bruce had to pay a very high price for this relationship, however. As part of the Coalition agreement, the Country Party received five seats in a Cabinet of 11. Page also became Treasurer and ranked second in the Cabinet. The Nationalists also made major concessions on rural development and taxation policy compromises that stirred some resentment among some members of Bruce's party. Page, who would serve as Treasurer and "de facto" <a href="Deputy%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Deputy Prime Minister</a> throughout Bruce's tenure, would become a great admirer of Bruce, stating, "He was a leader who impressed his colleagues with his sincerity and his capacity, and earned their loyalty as the reward for his wisdom and integrity."

Bruce's appointment as prime minister marked an important turning point in Australian political history. He was the first prime minister who had not been involved in the movement for <a href="Federation%20of%20Australia">Federation</a>, who had not been a member of a colonial or state parliament, and who had not been a member of the original <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201901">1901 federal parliament</a>. He was, in addition, the first prime minister to head a cabinet consisting entirely of Australian-born ministers. Yet Bruce himself was frequently caricatured in public as "an Englishman who happened to have been born in Australia". He drove a <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Limited">Rolls-Royce</a>, wore white <a href="Spats%20%28footwear%29">spats</a>, and was often seen as distant and lacking the common touch: characteristics that did little to personally endear him to the Australian public.

In 1923 Australia was prosperous by comparison with other developed nations of the period, having quickly rebounded economically after World War I. Unemployment and inflation were relatively low by international standards, and <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Australia">Commonwealth</a> revenues had grown significantly since Australia became a federation. Australia was a vast and richly resourced country with fewer than six million inhabitants, and Bruce made it his government's priority to develop Australia's economy. In his first speech to the House of Representatives as prime minister, he outlined a comprehensive vision for Australia that centred on economic development, reform of the <a href="Federalism%20in%20Australia">federal system</a>, increased Commonwealth powers over industrial relations, a greater voice for Australia within the British Empire and the establishment of a national capital. He summarised this vision as a program of "men, money and markets".

According to Bruce, men were needed to allow Australia's extensive resources to be developed. In 1923, much of Australia's land was virtually unoccupied, and Bruce believed Australia had the potential to be one of the most fertile and productive nations in the world, which could sustain populations upward of 100 million over time more than 16 times the population of his time. Despite dissenting voices from scientists, who noted that poor climate, soils and water availability were significant barriers to large populations, the Bruce-Page government enacted policies to encourage large numbers of British to migrate to Australia. Under the auspices of the new Development and Migration Commission, £34 million in loans took place over the decade starting in 1924 to facilitate immigrant settlement through improvements to rural infrastructure, land access, and subsidising immigrant journeys ("passages"). Estimates as high as half a million British immigrants over ten years were predicted at the start of the policy, whereas just over 200,000 travelled to Australia during that time period. Bruce's settlement plan rested on rural growth. Migrants were often selected on the basis of their willingness to work on the land; state and Commonwealth governments concentrated their investment on rural development and encouraged returned servicemen to take up farms on the periphery of settled areas. Despite this, a majority of these migrants settled in urban areas, as Australia's rural areas were far more remote and difficult to work (than for example England's) and many of those taking advantage of the assistance scheme were urban workers or family and friends of those already settled.

Immigration from outside Great Britain and her dominions was considered unpalatable the Bruce government upheld the <a href="White%20Australia%20policy">White Australia policy</a> by placing strong restrictions on immigration from other areas, notwithstanding its population growth targets. In his campaign speech for the 1925 election, Bruce stated:It is necessary that we should determine what are the ideals towards which every Australian would desire to strive. I think those ideals might well be stated as being to secure our national safety, and to ensure the maintenance of our White Australia Policy to continue as an integral portion of the British Empire. We intend to keep this country white and not allow its people to be faced with the problems that at present are practically insoluble in many parts of the world.

Money was borrowed from Britain to fund the state's programs and at an unprecedented rate. Over £230 million was extended in loans from the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a> to state and Commonwealth treasuries during the 1920s. A further £140 million arrived through private investment. Bruce's plan for Australian economic development needed a much stronger role for the Commonwealth government than had been traditionally accepted. Both he and Page were "conspicuously national rather than federal in their outlook" and sought major changes to federal-state relations in order implement their development policy. Increasingly our problems are becoming national in character ... Our financial resources are curtailed and there is an immediate repercussion throughout the Commonwealth. All our problems are common problems. None can be prosperous unless all are prospering. I am more convinced that we have to look at all our problems with the eyes of a nation and not as individuals. Where a great problem confronts a State it may be solved by the cooperation of the Commonwealth for the benefit of the States, and the benefit and advancement of the whole of Australia.

The Bruce–Page plan of May 1923 put in motion efforts to coordinate state-federal operations in several areas, particularly infrastructure and rural development schemes. The "Main Roads Development Act of 1923" was one of the first and most important legislative accomplishments in this vein. The act leveraged Section 96 of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Australia">Constitution</a> to grant financial assistance to the states by employing it to fund road construction and maintenance according to the plans of the federal transportation portfolio in effect allowing the Commonwealth to operate directly in what was constitutionality the exclusive domain of the state governments. The Act would provide a precedent for many types of "special purpose payments" that became a common feature of Australian federal fiscal relations. Despite some major successes, Bruce was more frequently frustrated by a lack of progress in many key areas of intergovernmental cooperation. The states could not be induced to standardise electrical power schemes, nor unify on <a href="track%20gauge">track gauge</a>s, nor <a href="national%20health%20insurance">national health insurance</a> despite years of work and solid arguments in favour.

Although men and money had been secured, the markets component of the Bruce plan was never fully realised. At the <a href="1923%20Imperial%20Conference">1923 Imperial Economic Conference</a>, Bruce lobbied consistently for the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> government of <a href="Stanley%20Baldwin">Stanley Baldwin</a> to make changes to Great Britain's trading arrangements to give <a href="Trade%20preference">preference</a> to dominion products over imports from other nations. He argued for Empire-wide economic trading arrangements that filled domestic demands by production from member states before seeking supplemental imports from other countries and empires. Baldwin and the Conservatives attempted to introduce such a scheme in Britain; however, the British public feared higher prices for basic products (particularly food), and this fear was a factor in the Conservative government's defeat in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201923">election of December 1923</a>. Baldwin's successor <a href="Ramsay%20MacDonald">Ramsay MacDonald</a> repudiated the plan, much to Bruce's chagrin, and attempts to revive negotiations foundered as economic conditions worsened throughout the decade. World agricultural prices stalled in the mid-1920s as European and American agricultural production recovered to pre-war levels, and Australian exports were crowded out of markets as the decade progressed.

In 1927, Earle Page handed down the first budget in deficit for the coalition government, and Bruce recognised that Australia's economic position was deteriorating. Federal and state debt that year totalled just over £1 billion, of which £305 million were war debts and the rest had been spent on development that had failed had deliver high returns. Nearly half of the total debt was owed to overseas lenders, principally those in London. Economic growth was slow, and far lower than the levels hoped. Exports and revenues were falling behind government needs, and investors had begun to express alarm at Australia's level of debt. Bruce persisted with his plans and believed that growing Australian exports were the key to rectifying the problems, thus justifying further investment and encouragement of population growth. The government did act to try to manage the debt problem. By the mid-1920s, states were borrowing at unsustainable rates to fund their own programs to compensate for dwindling revenues. In response, Bruce proposed that the responsibility for all government debts, Commonwealth and state, and the authority to acquire new debt, should be handed over to a <a href="Loan%20Council">National Loan Council</a> in which all states would have one vote and the Commonwealth would have two votes and the casting vote. He also moved to abolish per capita payments to the states, to be replaced by a funding formula tied more to financial need. These two changes formed the "Financial Agreement of 1927", the provisions of which were approved by <a href="Australian%20referendum%2C%201928">referendum in 1928</a>. These changes would prove to be amongst the most significant in Australian constitutional history, as the states had now lost much of their financial independence. Faced with severe financial pressures and an increasing reliance upon Commonwealth transfer payments, after some resistance the states consented, although vertical fiscal imbalance between the states and the Commonwealth continued to be an enduring feature of Australian federal relations.

Bruce set about applying his business principles to his cabinet, putting his experience as both a corporate manager and rowing coach to use in a cabinet system that was orderly and practical. He implemented a formal system whereby a proper agenda for cabinet meetings would be formulated, and the minister responsible for each item would circulate papers to bring other members up to speed on the issue. His decision-making procedures ensured that his colleagues were informed and actively participated in decisions or if they disagreed, gave leave for cabinet members to absent themselves from meetings to preserve cabinet solidarity. In this respect Bruce earned the quick respect and approval of his colleagues, and in many respects came to dominate cabinet through his industriousness and knowledgability. Cabinet minister George Pearce would later conclude that Bruce was the best of the prime ministers that he served or opposed in his 38-year parliamentary career.

Bruce also greatly strengthened the research and information-gathering capacity of the executive, and sought to make decisions and policy on the basis of the best available evidence and information. A record 22 <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a>s reported to the Bruce government, as well as scores of other inquiries and research projects undertaken by the Commonwealth in a wide range of areas, particularly on economic, industrial and agricultural matters. Recognising that investment in science was essential to expanding the opportunities for agricultural and economic development in Australia, Bruce established the <a href="Council%20for%20Scientific%20and%20Industrial%20Research">Council for Scientific and Industrial Research</a> (CSIR), now known as the CSIRO. He established the Bureau of Economic Research in 1929 and for the first time economists were regularly employed to advise the government on what had been until then exclusively political issues. By the time he left office, he had put in place extensive structures to provide information to the prime minister and the executive branch on most major areas of policy, a major development in the professional capacity of the Australian prime minister.
Under Bruce the Australian government also moved to its new permanent home in the planned federal city of <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>. Plans for a new federal capital had been circulated since the time of Federation, and a site on the <a href="Molonglo%20River">Molonglo River</a> was selected in 1913. Design and construction had proceeded slowly due to World War I as well as funding and management problems. Bruce was a committed advocate of the new capital, however, stating: "For the purposes of Federation it was essential that there should be some central point of nationhood, suitable to Australia as a nation ... and sooner or later there would have to be a national capital, overriding State boundaries and State prejudices." This came to pass on 9 May 1927 when the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">Federal Parliament</a> moved to its new premises in Canberra; Bruce had moved himself and his wife to <a href="The%20Lodge%20%28Australia%29">The Lodge</a> a few days earlier. At the Federal Parliament's opening ceremony, Bruce decided that voices of the clerks of the House of Representatives and the <a href="Australian%20Senate">Senate</a> were too heavily <a href="Australian%20accent">accented</a>, and determined that he would personally welcome the <a href="George%20VI">Duke of York</a> and co-open the new building a move that was criticised by several parliamentarians. The business of transferring government and cabinet operations to the new capital proceeded slowly over 1927 and 1928. This was an administrative task that occupied a significant proportion of the government's time in those years, with many departments only very gradually transferring from Melbourne, much to Bruce's consternation.

Loyal to the concept of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>, Bruce envisaged strengthening it through mutual economic development, greater political cooperation, and common policies on defence, trade and foreign affairs. His first trip abroad as prime minister was for the 1923 Imperial Conference in London. Bruce put forward a wide range of proposals for stronger cooperation between Great Britain and her <a href="dominion">dominion</a>s in a wide range of areas, particularly in the areas of trade, defence and the formulation of a common foreign policy. He particularly desired a greater role for the dominions in imperial affairs, including a collective decision-making body for common questions of defence and foreign affairs. He took exception to a lack of involvement in foreign policy decisions made by Britain that would have significant ramifications for Australia. In 1922, in what became known as the <a href="Chanak%20Crisis">Chanak Crisis</a>, British brinkmanship over Turkey's aggressive manoeuvres to <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281919%E2%80%9322%29">redefine its border with Greece</a> had escalated to the point where the British cabinet had threatened war against Turkey. This threat included military participation of dominions in an intervention, though no dominion government had been informed of the developments in Turkey. Although a diplomatic end to the crisis was eventually found, dominion leaders were angered at having almost been committed to a military conflict without any consultation.

Bruce pushed for greater consultation and voice for the dominions, and succeeded in having <a href="Richard%20Casey%2C%20Baron%20Casey">Richard Casey</a> appointed as a permanent political liaison in London who would have access to British government decisions and act as a conduit between Westminster and Melbourne. He also successfully lobbied for the creation of a <a href="Dominion%20Office">Dominion Office</a> separated out from the <a href="Colonial%20Office">Colonial Office</a> to acknowledge the different state of affairs that now existed in the Empire. However, while fellow dominions generally agreed that the imperial system should be modified, not all shared his vision for closer collaboration and strong ties. Canada and the <a href="Union%20of%20South%20Africa">Union of South Africa</a> were instead seeking greater independence from London, and there was little enthusiasm for many of Bruce's more ambitious plans for inter-empire trade and policy cooperation.

Despite Australia's greater representation in London after 1923, Bruce's hope for collective imperial decision-making was dashed once more with the British decision to recognise the Soviet Union in 1924. This act dismayed the fervently anti-communist Bruce, who disagreed with the decision ideologically and on the grounds that once again the dominions had not been consulted. Ultimately, though, the differences between Britain's and her dominions' opinions on the matter were too great to be reconciled. Instead, Britain signed the "General Treaty" with the Soviet Union only on her own behalf, marking the first major split between Britain and Australia on a matter of foreign policy. Despite its applicability solely to European security arrangements, Bruce had criticised Britain's signing of the <a href="Locarno%20Treaties">Locarno Treaties</a> in 1925 without dominion consultation; though the eventual treaty was not binding on the dominions.

The <a href="1926%20Imperial%20Conference">1926 Imperial Conference</a> confirmed that Britain and her dominions were rapidly diverging in interests and that greater independence not greater cooperation was the most practical solution. Bruce recognised the empire had reached a turning point, but despite his optimism for a reinvigorated imperial system, there was little interest from other governments. His plan for greater economic and defensive cooperation was discussed, as well as a revival of imperial preference in trading arrangements, but such ideas were now politically unpalatable in Britain and failed to develop. His attitudes were almost the opposite of those held by the leaders of Canada, South Africa and the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a>. As Prime Minister Baldwin remarked at the conference, "If you, Mr Bruce, would use the word 'Empire' a bit less and you <a href="Patrick%20McGilligan">Mr McGilligan</a> would use it a bit more, then we would make better progress." Ultimately proposals for greater independence won out, and 1926 Imperial Conference recognised through the <a href="Balfour%20Declaration%20of%201926">Balfour Declaration</a> that dominions were essentially independent entities that freely associated as the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">British Commonwealth of Nations</a>, though after much negotiation it stopped short of using the terms "nation" or "state". <a href="Governor-General">Governors-General</a> were redefined as representatives only of the <a href="British%20monarch">British monarch</a>, not the <a href="British%20government">British government</a>, and were obliged now to act only on the advice of their respective dominion governments. These changes were both symbolically and practically significant in the transformation of the dominions from colonies to independent nations. Bruce had mixed feelings about these developments; on the one hand he believed that the Empire was still a strong and vital international organization playing a positive role in international affairs, but on the other hand he was disappointed that other member nations did not share his vision or commitment to maintaining its integrity and unity. Bruce did have some successes at the conference, however, expanding the work of the Imperial Economic Committee and increasing inter-empire cooperation in technical and scientific areas.

Strikes and industrial unrest were frequent in the aftermath of World War I, arising from discontent over poor conditions and the rise of militant labour organizations like the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Australia">Communist Party of Australia</a> and the <a href="Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World">Industrial Workers of the World</a>. The problems were made worse in Australia due to the overlapping system of industrial courts that had evolved since Federation. Although <a href="Commonwealth%20Court%20of%20Conciliation%20and%20Arbitration">federal arbitration</a> was intended for industrial disputes that impacted upon multiple states or federal employees, courts had through several judgments greatly expanded the potential jurisdiction of federal arbitration, and the system had developed into a duality with both state and federal tribunals weighing into a wide range of industrial disputes. This was exploited by both unions and employers, who pursued matters in the courts they felt most likely to be favourable and switched between different jurisdictions to arrive at the best combination of state and federal conditions. Protracted disputes arose as employers and employees pursued disputes in different courts or refused to recognise the rulings of one in favour of the other. Billy Hughes and several of his predecessors had sought resolution to the problem through greater Commonwealth powers, but all <a href="Referendums%20in%20Australia">referendums</a> to expand Commonwealth industrial powers had failed at the ballot box.

Bruce's attitudes towards industrial relations were varied, and he was initially unsympathetic to either employer or employee complaints, believing the best resolutions to be those brokered between businesses and their employees. He frequently called upon both sides to embrace a spirit of cooperation. The situation became acute when waterfront workers led by the <a href="Seamen%27s%20Union%20of%20Australia">Seamen's Union</a> went on strike in 1925. This had severe and immediate effect on the Australian economy, reliant as it was on sea transportation for its imports and exports, a situation the Prime Minister recognised as untenable. With the union disregarding Commonwealth rulings on the dispute, Bruce rushed through the "Navigation Act" and the "Immigration Act". The first allowed British and foreign shipping not working under Australian industrial awards to operate in Australian waters (although British vessels working in Australia would soon initiate a strike of their own). The second allowed the Commonwealth to deport any foreign-born person whom a special tribunal found guilty of "disrupting the industrial life of the community". Key foreign-born strike leaders were immediately targeted for deportation, but New South Wales Premier <a href="Jack%20Lang%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Jack Lang</a> refused to allow <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Police%20Force">state police</a> to serve summonses on two leading union leaders. Bruce responded with the "Peace Officers Act", which re-established a <a href="Commonwealth%20Police">Commonwealth police force</a>.

These heavy-handed tactics drew outrage from the Labor Party, which challenged the Prime Minister to seek approval from the people. This Bruce did, and the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201925">elections of 1925</a> were Australia's first "<a href="red%20scare">red scare</a>" election. He campaigned for industrial peace and an increased Commonwealth role in securing it, but also denounced "foreign agitators" and "class war" in appealing for law and order on the waterfront. He openly challenged pre-existing federal arrangements, stating on the campaign trail that Australia "should now consider whether that great historic instrument, the Constitution, meets the needs of to-day in the light of the developments which have taken place". The campaign was a success and the Bruce government was easily re-elected, increasing by 11 seats its majority over a disheartened ALP, whose leader <a href="Matthew%20Charlton">Matthew Charlton</a> was in poor health.

"My government was returned to power on a clear issue and with a definite mission ... to introduce measures for the preservation of industrial peace", Bruce declared during his second term, and called <a href="Australian%20referendum%2C%201926">a referendum</a> to amend the Australian Constitution and bring industrial relations under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. Attempts to amend the constitution for this purpose had been rejected narrowly in <a href="Australian%20referendum%2C%201911%20%28Trade%20and%20Commerce%29">1911</a>, <a href="Australian%20referendum%2C%201913%20%28Industrial%20Matters%29">1913</a> and <a href="Australian%20referendum%2C%201919%20%28Legislative%20Powers%29">1919</a>, but against a background of ongoing industrial strife, Bruce made clear the problems of mixed jurisdiction, confusing dual-awards, and insufficient regulatory and enforcement powers at the Commonwealth level. Controversially, he also formulated an "essential services" question to be put at the same time, giving the government the power to protect the public from any "actual or probable disruption to essential services". These proposals drew hostile reception from many quarters even from future conservative prime minister <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> and both the Australian Labor Party and conservative groups were divided in opinion on the amendments, with the ALP eventually taking no fixed position on the questions. But by September the issue had drawn so much controversy and ill-feeling that it was no surprise for many commentators that the proposals failed to attract sufficient popular support to overcome the high bar for constitutional change.
The problems of industrial unrest continued to flare up, and the waterfront remained a flashpoint. In a review of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act in 1928, Bruce required industrial courts to consider the economic effects of its awards in addition to the welfare of worker. Immediate problems followed when a new award for waterside workers in 1928 worsened conditions for workers on economic grounds. New industrial action led by the <a href="Maritime%20Union%20of%20Australia">Waterside Workers Federation</a> broke out. In Melbourne these turned to riots, claiming casualties and at least one fatality. Reviving the "red scare" pitch for the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201928">1928 election</a> campaign, Bruce pushed the "<a href="Transport%20Workers%20Act%201928">Transport Workers Act</a>" through parliament in response, which gave the executive unprecedented regulatory power in industrial relations. All waterfront workers now required federal licenses, or "dog collars" as they were derisively known, to work. The act allowed the Commonwealth government to effectively control who worked on the docks and nearly destroyed the Waterside Workers Federation, earning the government deep unpopularity among organised labour.

At the 1928 election Bruce's government was returned to power, but it now had a majority of just nine a fragile result, given the growing propensity for Nationalist member defections. Most of the Nationalists' parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out. <a href="James%20Scullin">James Scullin</a> had assumed the leadership of the ALP earlier in the year, upon the retirement of Charlton, and the party was invigorated as a consequence. Bruce was undeterred, though, and became convinced that unless costs of production for industry in Australia could be lowered and industrial peace secured, Australia was heading towards a major economic crisis. This doctrine was the basis of his appeals to the public for the next year and a half.

As early as 1927 economic indicators were signalling the onset of a recession in Australia. By 1929, the evidence was unavoidable that recession was becoming depression as a resulting of rapidly deteriorating international conditions. In that year, prices for Australian exports fell by nearly a third and GDP had fallen by 10%, with no attendant fall in the cost of living. Australia's debt now stood at £631 million the interest payments on which were equivalent to nearly half of Australia's export receipts, a situation difficult to sustain even in a positive economic climate. Investors and banks recognised the risk and Australia's credit access was rapidly drying up. Bruce's grand economic development plans had increased the national debt significantly yet had delivered only marginal economic expansion in the short term.

To make matters worse for the government, industrial unrest was a persisting problem, particularly in the economically key states of New South Wales and Victoria. The opposition had become more potent as well: Scullin was widely recognised as one of the parliament's most gifted and articulate members; even his opponents respected his personal probity. Scullin forecast that the Australian economy was highly vulnerable given its indebtedness, and was on a course for severe depression if government finances were not turned around dramatically.

Furthermore, the Prime Minister's own party was breaking down underneath him. There had been no official party platform yet agreed to, and individual members had a wide degree of latitude to determine the issues they ran on, leading to frequent government defections on legislation. The government's existing nine-seat majority shrank during 1928 and 1929 over various issues, as a result of by-elections, and several leading figures who had previously worked with Bruce became increasingly sharp critics of him. Hughes and <a href="Edward%20Mann%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Edward Mann</a> were two of the government's most ardent opponents in 1929.

Worsening economic conditions had put further pressure on industrial relations, with unemployment rising and employers seeking to cut costs. Strikes of sugar mill workers in 1927, waterside workers in 1928, and then transport and timber industry workers in 1929 continued to disrupt economic operations. The worst came with ongoing disputes between miners and mine owners on the coalfields of New South Wales had culminated in riots and lockouts in 1929, and intervention by the Bruce government failed to produce a settlement. Notably, in March 1929 <a href="Newcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Newcastle</a>-based mine owner John Brown locked out workers from his mines at <a href="Pelaw%20Main%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Pelaw Main</a> and Richmond Main to try to force acceptance of lower wages. Attorney-General <a href="John%20Latham%20%28judge%29">John Latham</a> pursued legal action against Brown for illegally using coercive industrial tactics, but Bruce intervened to stop the prosecution, believing the case to be doubtful and that dropping it would give the government a chance to negotiate an end to the dispute. The mine-owners refused to accede to government-brokered negotiations anyway, and the government was seen to have been siding with rich businesses and applying double standards, undermining Bruce's own credibility as an impartial leader and law-and-order prime minister.

Bruce and the conservatives in parliament became increasingly convinced that "economic deterioration [was] the product, rather than the possible cause, of worsening industrial relations." Exasperated, the Prime Minister made a dramatic move and presented an ultimatum to the Australian state governments: either they should voluntarily hand their powers of industrial regulation to the federal government, or the federal government would divest itself of its industrial powers and dismantle federal arbitration. The announcement came as a major shock to all sides of politics, not least the members of Bruce's own cabinet, most of whom had not been informed of the dramatic change in policy until the day it was announced to the states. Bruce calculated that the states would not give up their powers, and thus the move was one designed to sanction the end of Commonwealth arbitration. For Bruce, the only inconceivable outcome now was that the status quo of dual jurisdiction remained unchanged. The opposition to the proposal, which the Prime Minister introduced to the parliament as the "Maritime Industries Bill", was swift and fierce. In 1929 over 150 unions and 700,000 workers were covered by Commonwealth awards over a wide range of industries although there was dissatisfaction in the coal and timber sectors, most were happy with their arrangements and feared worse pay and conditions if moved back to state awards. He defended his actions as being necessary to create certainty and end the duplication that had caused so many problems in recent years.

Other government decisions in 1929 had attracted controversy as well. Page handed down his last budget on 22 August, which hinted at the burgeoning debt crisis and introduced a new tax on entertainment and theatres to help cover the deficit. The tax was very unpopular with the public, and the entertainment industry mounted a vocal campaign to stop it. Bruce, supported by the "Brigden Report" of 1929, also raised concern that protective tariffs were too high and were in need of reform a position controversial with the powerful protected industries.

The second reading of the "Maritime Industries Bill" passed by only four votes, with Hughes, Edward Mann and <a href="George%20Maxwell%20%28Australian%20politician%29">George Maxwell</a> voting against the government. Hughes moved an amendment to the bill that stipulated it should only take effect after being approved by the people at a referendum or general election. Bruce ruled out any referendum, stating that the amendment would constitute a vote of confidence in his government and urged his party to vote it down. Nationalist MP <a href="Walter%20Marks%20%28politician%29">Walter Marks</a> and Independent MP <a href="William%20McWilliams">William McWilliams</a> joined the opposition, giving the opposition a one-vote majority. Bruce and his supporters now lobbied the Speaker, Sir <a href="Littleton%20Groom">Littleton Groom</a> to make a deliberative vote in committee to tie the numbers, leaving the Committee chairman <a href="James%20Bayley%20%28politician%29">James Bayley</a> with the casting (and presumably pro-government) vote. Groom refused, citing long-standing <a href="British%20Parliament">Westminster</a> (though not Australian) parliamentary tradition of the speaker's impartiality. Groom's bitterness at having been dismissed by Bruce from the job of <a href="Attorney-General%20of%20Australia">Attorney-General</a> in 1925 had a significant bearing on his later decision.

A snap election was called, with Bruce taking his case to the people that dramatic action on industrial relations was needed. Opposition Leader Scullin forcefully attacked the government, blaming the Prime Minister for an industrial environment that was adversarial and punitive, stressing that Commonwealth arbitration had safeguarded many rights of workers and was completely workable with conciliation and proper consultation. Scullin also criticised the government for the growing debt problem and economic malaise, which for some years he had predicted would lead to a major economic crisis.

In the event, the government was <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201929">soundly defeated on 12 October</a>, losing more than half its seats in parliament. To add to his humiliation, Bruce was defeated in his own seat of Flinders by Labor challenger <a href="Jack%20Holloway">Jack Holloway</a>. On paper, there was no indication that Bruce was in any danger of losing his seat; he held Flinders with a reasonably safe majority of 10.7 percent in 1928. However, on the second count Holloway picked up enough preferences from an independent Liberal candidate to give him the victory. Bruce was the first sitting prime minister to lose his own seat, a feat which would not be repeated until 2007. He was measured in defeat however, stating, "The people have said they do not want my services, and I am going into the banishment to which they have sent me."

Bruce returned to England after his defeat to holiday and attend to his business. Sir John Latham, took over as leader of the Nationalists. With the <a href="Stock%20market%20crash%20of%201929">stock market crash in 1929</a> and the onset of the <a href="Great%20Depression%20in%20Australia">Great Depression in Australia</a>, Bruce commented to his colleagues that their defeat was probably fortunate. But he ardently defended his government's record, maintaining that the economic crisis was inevitable and that his own policies were justified attempts to try to strengthen the Australian economy. It was this defence that he mounted in April 1931 when he announced he would return to politics and seek to regain his seat of Flinders at the next election. By now the Nationalists had regrouped as the <a href="United%20Australia%20Party">United Australia Party</a> (UAP) under <a href="Joseph%20Lyons">Joseph Lyons</a>, who had defected with several others from the embattled Scullin government.

In November 1931 the Scullin government was defeated in parliament over its controversial <a href="Premiers%27%20Plan">Premiers' Plan</a>, catching Bruce by surprise as he was in England attending to Paterson, Laing and Bruce affairs when a <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201931">new election</a> was called. The Scullin government was subsequently defeated in a landslide, losing a then-record 32 seats; the two Labor factions were cut down to only 18 seats between them. With Holloway having abandoned Flinders to run in the much friendlier <a href="Division%20of%20Melbourne%20Ports">Melbourne Ports</a>, Bruce was returned "in absentia" to his old seat, regaining it with a swing of 18.5 percent. He was appointed assistant treasurer in the new Lyons Government, Lyons having taken the treasury portfolio personally. Lyons leaned heavily on Bruce and Latham in his first six months of government, though Bruce had by now set his sights on international affairs rather than the domestic crisis.

Bruce led the Australian delegation to the <a href="British%20Empire%20Economic%20Conference">1932 Imperial Economic Conference</a> in Ottawa. He redoubled his efforts to improve Australian economic prospects with the empire, and the conference agreed to a limited form of his long-sought imperial preference scheme that would give Australia greater access and competitiveness in imperial markets over five years, an achievement for which Bruce received much praise from the Lyons government. The closer trading arrangements of the <a href="Ottawa%20Agreements">Ottawa Agreements</a> would set the pattern for Australian-British trade relations until Britain's entry in the <a href="European%20Common%20Market">European Common Market</a> in 1973.

After the success of the Imperial Economic Conference, Lyons appointed Bruce to London as Resident Minister in the United Kingdom it was to remain his and Ethel's home for the rest of their lives. His first task in London was to renegotiate the terms of Australia's burgeoning government debts, the repayment of which was crippling Depression-era Australia. Over two years, he negotiated with the <a href="Westminster%20Bank">Westminster Bank</a> and the British Government for loan conversions worth £84 million, which saved Australia millions of pounds in interest over several years and along with the Ottawa Agreements were significant in helping alleviate the Australian government's budgetary difficulties. Bruce was asked at several points during the 1930s to return to Australia by UAP backers and other political figures, who hoped that he could replace Lyons as prime minister. He himself had questioned Lyons' health and capacity to execute the role effectively, but he showed little interest in returning. In 1938 and 1939 Bruce was approached by senior UAP figures and Lyons himself to return to Australia and assume the leadership of the government, which was struggling under the ailing Lyons, but he either flatly declined or set conditions for his return (such as an all-party government behind him) that were impossible to meet.

In September 1933, Bruce was appointed by Lyons to replace the ailing <a href="Granville%20Ryrie">Sir Granville Ryrie</a> as <a href="High%20Commissioner%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom">High Commissioner to the United Kingdom</a>, giving him ambassadorial rank. He formally resigned from parliament on 7 October 1933. Bruce would excel in the new post, becoming a trusted confidant among Conservative politicians and a familiar face in British government circles, which led to him at one point considering entering British politics formally. Bruce was particularly close to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, with whom he frequently consulted, and was notably influential in pressing for <a href="Edward%20VIII%20abdication%20crisis">Edward VIII's abdication in 1936</a>. His importance and power in London was due in part to the free rein that Lyons gave him a rarity in the history of the position. Combined with the turmoil and frequent ministerial changes within the <a href="Department%20of%20External%20Affairs%20%281921%E2%80%9370%29">Commonwealth Department of External Affairs</a>, Bruce was generally credited as Australia's most influential and credible international representative during his posting, often determining matters of foreign policy in his own right.

Bruce represented Australia at the League of Nations and successfully lobbied for Australia to participate as a member of the League Council from 1933 to 1936. He opposed action against <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japan</a> following the <a href="Japanese%20invasion%20of%20Manchuria">invasion of Manchuria</a> in 1933, concerned as to <a href="Australia%E2%80%93Japan%20relations">Australia's trading relationship with Japan</a> and the potential future threat it posed to peace in the Pacific. He also attempted to steer the League away from sanctioning member nations, believing it yet lacked the military or economic sway to do so effectively and feared the breakdown of the League a prospect that loomed after <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a> and Japan departed the body in 1933. During the <a href="Abyssinia%20Crisis">Abyssinia Crisis</a>, Bruce again counselled against partial sanctions, believing them the worst option as they would not stop the <a href="Second%20Italo-Ethiopian%20War">Ethiopian invasion</a> and yet would alienate Italy then a <a href="Stresa%20Front">potential ally</a> against a rearming Nazi Germany. He further argued for much greater rearmament efforts in the United Kingdom and France to provide greater military capacity to enforce future decisions by the League. Bruce assumed the presidency of the League of Nations Council in 1936 at the height of the crisis and after the failure of the <a href="Hoare%E2%80%93Laval%20Pact">Hoare–Laval Pact</a> between France, Italy and Britain, but further attempts to forestall the invasion failed. He presided as League Council President during the <a href="Rhineland%20Crisis">Rhineland Crisis</a>, although once again attempts to respond to fascist aggression failed. Although this did not shake his conviction in the potential of the League, he saw it doomed to failure without fundamental reforms to its structure and system of sanctions. He was nominated by Turkey to chair the 1936 <a href="Montreux%20Convention%20Regarding%20the%20Regime%20of%20the%20Straits">Montreux Conference</a>, which was far more successful in negotiating international agreement on passage through the <a href="Turkish%20Straits">Turkish Straits</a> an issue of particular relevance to Bruce as a veteran of the Gallipoli campaign. Despite the turmoil of his presidency, the League historian F.B. Walters would later describe Bruce as "the best, perhaps, of the many first-rate chairmen who presided over the Council, Conferences, or Committees of the League".

By 1937 Bruce's attention had shifted to social and economic cooperation, which he believed had far greater potential for success and was of greater importance to humanity at large. He had taken a leading role in promoting agriculture, nutrition and economic cooperation through the League of Nations, working intensively with <a href="Frank%20McDougall">Frank McDougall</a> and <a href="John%20Boyd%20Orr">John Boyd Orr</a> throughout the decade. In 1937 he presented a plan of "economic appeasement", which built on this work and aimed to ease international tensions by reviving international trade and improving living standards in Europe through better working conditions, lower food prices, rural credits and housing assistance. Barriers to trade would gradually be reduced while European nations still recovering from the depression would be reintegrated into the international economy. In doing so he made a firm link between international trade and international peace, believing it key to unlocking world economic potential. Foreshadowing the logic of the <a href="Marshall%20Plan">Marshall Plan</a>, Bruce argued that unrelieved economic and social hardship threatened to push other nations towards fascism or communism. 

I feel very strongly that it will be impossible to find a solution to the political problems of Europe and remove the present nightmare conditions unless something is done to improve the economic position ... it is vital for the prestige and future wellbeing of the League that it should afford active leadership towards bringing about economic appeasement.

The plan was supported by Secretary-General <a href="Joseph%20Louis%20Anne%20Avenol">Joseph Louis Anne Avenol</a>, who like Bruce recognised that the League was rapidly becoming moribund and that a major change of direction was needed, although neither was successful in convincing key states in contributing to the plan. Critically, new British Prime Minister <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a> could not be convinced by Bruce to invest further into the development of the League, and the body began to lose its political impetus as war loomed. He would continue to press for League reform in the lead up to the war. The Bruce committee to advise on League reform was formed in 1939 in the aftermath of the <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20Czechoslovakia">partition of Czechoslovakia</a> by Nazi Germany and the apparent failure of Chamberlain's <a href="appeasement">appeasement</a> policy. This committee, which met in July and August 1939, proposed a significant expansion of Bruce's earlier ideas to the League, bringing a wide range of economic and social programs under its purview as a means of fostering international cooperation. Their work, however, would be rendered moot by the outbreak of World War II.

In the events leading up to World War II, Bruce and Lyons had been supporters of the British under Chamberlain and the policy of appeasement exercised with regards to the <a href="reoccupation%20of%20the%20Rhineland">reoccupation of the Rhineland</a>, the <a href="Anschluss">Anschluss</a> and the <a href="Munich%20Crisis">Munich Crisis</a>. Even during the "<a href="phoney%20war">phoney war</a>", Bruce continued to advocate the implementation of a more durable international system to enforce peace through mutual disarmament, the expansion of transnational trade, and global organizations capable of addressing the pressing social and economic questions that he felt were the recurrent causes of international conflict. He had become a close confidant of senior Conservative Party figures <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Anthony Eden</a> and Neville Chamberlain in this period, and was strident in advancing the opinion of Australia (and the dominions more broadly) that negotiation and compromise with Nazi Germany was preferable to war. Bruce actively participated in the negotiations for the <a href="Munich%20Agreement">Munich Agreement</a>. When Lyons died in April 1939, Earle Page and Richard Casey personally appealed for Bruce to return to Australia and take over once more as prime minister at the head of the UAP. Bruce demurred, however, and made it the condition of his return that he be allowed to sit in parliament as an <a href="Independent%20%28politician%29">independent</a> and lead an all-party <a href="unity%20government">unity government</a>. Such conditions were politically impossible to meet, and Robert Menzies <a href="1939%20United%20Australia%20Party%20leadership%20election">was elected as the new leader of the UAP</a>.
<a href="Declaration%20of%20war%20by%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Britain's declaration of war</a> against Germany on 3 September 1939 was followed within hours by Australia's Prime Minister Menzies stating that because of Britain's declaration Australia too was now at war with Germany. Winston Churchill's accession as British Prime Minister in May 1940 brought Bruce into frequent conflict with the British government. Churchill saw the dominions as still semi-dependent colonies who were at London's command whereas Bruce saw the Empire as a kind of international partnership and the dominions as rightful parties to the decision-making process. Britain's preoccupation with the European theatre alarmed Australian politicians, given the tenuous position of Far Eastern possessions and the looming possibility of Japanese invasion. After <a href="Pacific%20War">a string of defeats in the Far East</a>, particularly the <a href="Fall%20of%20Singapore">Fall of Singapore</a>, the Australian government was finally successful in having Bruce accredited to the <a href="British%20War%20Cabinet">British War Cabinet</a> and <a href="Pacific%20War%20Council">Pacific War Council</a> as an Australian (and dominion) representative. 
However, Bruce soon became embroiled in the disputes over Churchill's autocratic leadership style and his lack of consultation with the cabinet over war decisions. He was regularly left out of cabinet communique or not invited to meetings, much to his displeasure. With the fear of <a href="Proposed%20Japanese%20invasion%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">Japanese invasion</a> mounting in Australia throughout 1942, Bruce directly confronted Churchill on a number of occasions over Far East policy and the continuing lack of consultation with Australia and his own cabinet. Churchill usually responded by rebuffing him or pointedly excluding him further from government business. Although outwardly relenting in the face of pressure exerted by the dominions for representation in war decisions, Churchill routinely marginalised or ignored that representation. Bruce persisted in this difficult arrangement until May 1944 when he became completely disillusioned and resigned, choosing other forums in which to represent Australia in London. In spite of his tempestuous relationship with Churchill, Bruce was held in high regard by many cabinet members, particularly future prime ministers <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a> and Anthony Eden, and his dogged determination to advance dominion interests during the war years earned him high praise from <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a> and the other dominion prime ministers.

By the war's end in 1945, Bruce had become tired of the High Commission posting and hinted to Curtin's successor <a href="Ben%20Chifley">Ben Chifley</a> that he would not object to being replaced in the position. In the last years of the war he had envisaged a post-war order based on a continuing alliance of the four powers the United States, the British Empire, the Soviet Union and <a href="Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%9349%29">China</a> that could evolve into a new international body with a similar function as the League of Nations, but with a stronger role and authority in international matters. Bruce had rejoined Frank McDougall and John Boyd Orr in these years in reviving their proposals for international cooperation on nutrition and agriculture. He wrote and made representations at all levels on the subject, and became a leading voice once more advocating the creation of an international body to examine social and economic questions, much as he had done during his years with the League of Nations. The efforts of McDougall, Bruce and Orr finally paid off when their work came to the attention of <a href="Eleanor%20Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a>, and subsequently the American government, and their proposals would find expression at the Food and Agriculture Conference that <a href="Franklin%20Roosevelt">Franklin Roosevelt</a> convened in <a href="Hot%20Springs%2C%20Virginia">Hot Springs, Virginia</a>, in May 1943. This conference agreed to the establishment of the <a href="Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> (FAO), which became an associated institution with the United Nations when it was established formally in October 1945.

As the war in Europe drew to a close and the <a href="United%20Nations%20Charter">United Nations Charter</a> was promulgated in June 1945, Bruce's name was among those being considered to become the first <a href="Secretary-General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations">Secretary-General of the United Nations</a>, with American Secretary of State <a href="Dean%20Acheson">Dean Acheson</a> and <a href="British%20Foreign%20Minister">British Foreign Minister</a> Anthony Eden actively supporting his candidacy. Bruce, however, was now 62 and indicated that he felt himself too old for the position, instead preferring a less demanding role considering economic and social questions. In 1946 he assumed the chairmanship of the FAO Preparatory Commission on World Food Proposals, which had the mission of establishing a "world food board" to coordinate international policy on nutrition and develop a system to eliminate global agricultural shortages. He proposed many international schemes as part of this work, particularly a <a href="Food%20bank">world food reserve</a> and special pricing mechanisms to reallocate and release food to where it was most needed in times of need. Bruce's Commission also placed a high emphasis on agricultural modernization, <a href="International%20aid">international development aid</a>, commodity agreements and price stability to help starving developing nations in its findings presented in 1947. The proposals were never adopted, as the costs and challenges to national sovereignty proved too difficult to overcome politically.

Undeterred, Bruce was elected Chairman of the newly formed FAO Council in November 1947, working once more with John Boyd Orr, now Secretary-General of the FAO. Acute shortages of cereals and livestock were rampant following severe droughts in Europe, and the international food supply system was under serious strain after the devastation of the war. Bruce and the council worked in these years to distribute <a href="fertiliser">fertiliser</a> and <a href="agricultural%20machinery">agricultural machinery</a>, as well as improve nutrition, especially in less developed nations. More than two-thirds of the world was undernourished in 1949 and Bruce felt it imperative for the Council to bring these stark facts to the developed nations. A landmark agreement on technical aid between the FAO and the United Nations was reached in November 1949, and the FAO received the funding and logistical capacity to act on the food shortage crisis and the problems of poor nutrition in the developing world. Bruce and the FAO were successful in these years in supporting the recovery of world agricultural output. By 1951 this had exceeded pre-war levels, and general levels of nutrition were rising internationally, but by the time Bruce stepped down in that year neither had improved fast enough to keep pace with the <a href="Post-World%20War%20II%20baby%20boom">post-war population boom</a>. The Council faced major obstacles in supporting the improvement of conditions in the developing world as governments there began diverting resources to arms programs as independence, post-colonial and <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> conflicts multiplied. Frustrated by continuing world conflict and the lack of commitment from the developed world to support the lofty but very difficult aims of the FAO, both Bruce and Orr resigned from the FAO disappointed by its modest gains and insufficient powers to alleviate world food problems.

Bruce occupied a range of positions in his later years, sharing his time between the United Kingdom and Australia. He had been Chairman of the Finance Corporation of Industry since 1946 and continued in the role until 1957, providing finance to projects of benefit to the British national economy. Bruce helped establish the program in Australia in 1954 and on a Commonwealth basis in 1956. He became the first <a href="Chancellor%20%28education%29">Chancellor</a> of the newly established <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a> in 1952, and took an active interest in its development, especially as a research centre for the study of Asia and the Pacific. Bruce concluded that Australia's position in the world had changed as a result of World War II, commenting:
[Australia] has become a bridgehead between East and West. It is now vital that Australia should understand the problems of the East, that she should do whatever is in her power to alleviate those problems, and that she should interpret the nature of those problems to the rest of the world.
The residential college Bruce Hall was named in his honour, and he remained active in the life of the university until his retirement from the position in 1961. Bruce sat as director on many corporate boards in retirement, notably the <a href="National%20Bank%20of%20Australia">National Bank of Australia</a>, <a href="Peninsular%20and%20Oriental%20Steam%20Navigation%20Company">P&O</a> and the National Mutual Life Association. In 1947 he became the first Australian to sit in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> (<a href="John%20Forrest">Sir John Forrest</a> had been granted a peerage but died before it could be invested).

Having been elevated to the peerage as "Viscount Bruce of Melbourne" by long-time colleague Clement Attlee, he would be an active participant in the chamber, attending regularly right up until his death. Bruce used it as a platform to continue to campaign on international and national social and economic questions, and to promote recognition and representation for Australia within the Commonwealth, though by this time Australian and British interests were becoming increasingly far apart, and the British Empire was rapidly disintegrating. He also continued to lobby the British government in these years to increase its commitment to third world development and the FAO. An avid golfer his whole life, Bruce became the first Australian captain of the <a href="The%20Royal%20and%20Ancient%20Golf%20Club%20of%20St%20Andrews">Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews</a> in 1954. From 1948 to 1952 he was President of <a href="Leander%20Club">Leander Club</a>, while continuing to coach rowing at Cambridge University sporadically, and frequently appeared at public events both in Australia and in England.

Bruce remained active and in good health right through his retirement despite the gradual onset of <a href="deafness">deafness</a>, but the death of his wife Ethel in March 1967 took a deep toll on him. He died on 25 August 1967 at the age of 84. He was the last surviving member of <a href="Billy%20Hughes">Billy Hughes</a>' Cabinet. His memorial service was held at <a href="St%20Martin-in-the-Fields">St Martin-in-the-Fields</a> and was widely attended, including by representatives of the <a href="House%20of%20Windsor">Royal Family</a>. His ashes were scattered over <a href="Lake%20Burley%20Griffin">Lake Burley Griffin</a> in Canberra. The Canberra suburb of <a href="Bruce%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Bruce</a>, and the electoral <a href="Division%20of%20Bruce">Division of Bruce</a> based in south-east Melbourne, were both named for him after his death.

Despite his many accomplishments both at home and abroad, Bruce's post-prime ministerial career was not well known in Australia, and most still harboured memories of his harsh anti-union legislation and his government's landslide defeat in 1929. His public persona was one of an aloof man, too English for Australia in style and bearing. Upon his death in 1967, "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>" of his hometown Melbourne remarked that "for most Australians, he is little more than a shadow." Bruce spent much of his life and career in the United Kingdom, the country that conversely held him in high regard, but never forgot his Australian roots and for much of his career was a tireless advocate for its interests. In contrast to his image as a member of the British aristocratic elite, he spent much of his later career working for solutions to the problems facing the world's poorest.

Bruce was high-minded and ambitious in setting an agenda as prime minister he pursued complex and aspiring schemes of economic, social and administrative development, including grandiose solutions to the problem of industrial relations and an egalitarian reworking of the British Empire. In his diplomatic career he pursued better treatment for the Commonwealth and programs through the League of Nations and United Nations that would address world questions of pressing social and economic concern, culminating in his most ambitious work to eliminate world hunger through the Food and Agriculture Organization. The Australian government even nominated Bruce for the <a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> in recognition for these efforts. Yet his schemes frequently bordered on the idealistic, and he was frequently disappointed at the limited degree to which he could practically implement his ideas. As Bruce himself would concede in later life, he was overly ambitious by nature and "forever buying into things that aren't really my concern". But despite his lack of public recognition in Australia, peers and historians have long recognised the abiding impact Bruce had both as prime minister and internationalist, leading his successor as Chancellor of the Australian National University Sir <a href="John%20Cockcroft">John Cockcroft</a> to conclude in 1962 that Bruce was "probably the outstanding Australian of our time". The "Melbourne Sun" agreed with the assessment, stating upon his death that Bruce was "probably the least remembered but the most extraordinary of our Prime Ministers".

Jacques Plante

Joseph Jacques Omer Plante (; January 17, 1929 – February 27, 1986) was a <a href="Canadians">Canadian</a> professional <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> <a href="goaltender">goaltender</a>. During a career lasting from 1947 to 1975, he was considered to be one of the most important innovators in hockey. He played for the <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a> from 1953 to 1963; during his tenure, the team won the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> six times, including five consecutive wins. In 2017 Plante was named one of the '<a href="100%20Greatest%20NHL%20Players">100 Greatest NHL Players</a>' in history.

Plante retired in 1965 but was persuaded to return to the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> to play for the expansion <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a> in 1968. He was later traded to the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> in 1970 and to the <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a> in 1973. He joined the <a href="World%20Hockey%20Association">World Hockey Association</a> as coach and general manager for the <a href="Quebec%20Nordiques">Quebec Nordiques</a> in 1973–74. He then played goal for the <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a> in 1974–75, ending his professional career with that team.

Plante was the first NHL goaltender to wear a <a href="goaltender%20mask">goaltender mask</a> in regulation play on a regular and tested many versions of the mask (including the forerunner of today's mask/helmet combination) with the assistance of other experts. Plante was the first NHL goaltender to regularly play the puck outside his <a href="crease%20%28hockey%29">crease</a> in support of his team's <a href="defenceman%20%28ice%20hockey%29">defencemen</a>, and he often instructed his teammates from behind the play. Plante was inducted into the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> in 1978, was chosen as the goaltender of the Canadiens' "dream team" in 1985, and was inducted into the Quebec Sports Pantheon in 1994. The Montreal Canadiens retired Plante's jersey, #1, the following year. Plante ranks seventh among NHL goalies for all-time career wins with 437.

Plante was one of the first goaltenders to skate behind the net to stop the puck. He also was one of the first to raise his arm on an <a href="icing%20%28hockey%29">icing</a> call to let his defencemen know what was happening. He perfected a stand-up, positional style, cutting down the angles; he became one of the first goaltenders to write a how-to book about the position. He was a pioneer of stickhandling the puck; before that time, goaltenders passively stood in the net and simply deflected pucks to defencemen or backchecking forwards.

Plante was inducted into the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> in 1978, and into the Quebec Sports Pantheon in 1994. His jersey, #1, was retired in 1995 by the Montreal Canadiens. The <a href="Jacques%20Plante%20Memorial%20Trophy">Jacques Plante Memorial Trophy</a> was established in his honour as an award to the top goaltender in the <a href="Quebec%20Major%20Junior%20Hockey%20League">Quebec Major Junior Hockey League</a>. The <a href="Jacques%20Plante%20Trophy">Jacques Plante Trophy</a> was established in Switzerland after Plante's death; it is given out annually to the top Swiss goaltender. The main arena in Shawinigan, the town he grew up in, was renamed to <a href="Ar%C3%A9na%20Jacques%20Plante">Aréna Jacques Plante</a>.

Plante was selected by "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" magazine to its 1991 all-time All-Star team.

His injury and subsequent donning of a mask was depicted in an installment of Canada's "<a href="Heritage%20Minute">Heritage Minute</a>" series.

Plante was born on a farm near <a href="Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel%2C%20Quebec">Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel</a>, in <a href="Mauricie">Mauricie</a>, Quebec, the first of 11 children born to Palma and Xavier Plante. The family moved to <a href="Shawinigan">Shawinigan Falls</a>, where his father worked in one of the local factories. In 1932, Plante began to play hockey, skateless and with a tennis ball, using a goaltender's hockey stick his father had carved from a tree root. When he was five years old, Plante fell off a ladder and broke his hand. The fracture failed to heal properly and affected his playing style during his early hockey career; he underwent successful corrective surgery as an adult. Plante suffered from asthma starting in early childhood. This prevented him from skating for extended periods so he gravitated to playing goaltender. As his playing progressed, Jacques received his first regulation goaltender's stick for <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> of 1936. His father made Plante's first pads by stuffing potato sacks and reinforcing them with wooden panels. As a child, Plante played hockey outdoors in the bitterly cold Quebec winters. His mother taught him how to knit his own <a href="tuque">tuque</a>s to protect him from the cold. Plante continued knitting and embroidering throughout his life and wore his hand-knitted tuques while playing and practicing until entering the National Hockey League (NHL).

Plante's first foray into organized hockey came at age 12. He was watching his school's team practice, when the coach ordered the goaltender off the ice after a heated argument over his play, and Plante asked to replace him. The coach permitted him to play since there was no other available goaltender; it was quickly apparent that Plante could hold his own, despite the other players being many years older than he was. He impressed the coach and stayed on as the team's number one goaltender.

Two years later, Plante was playing for five different teams – the local factory team, and teams in the midget, juvenile, junior and intermediate categories. Plante demanded a salary from the factory team's coach after his father told him that the other players were being paid because they were company employees. The coach paid Plante 50 cents per game to retain him and maintain the team's popularity. Afterwards, Plante began to receive various offers from other teams; he was offered $80 per week—a considerable sum in those days—to play for a team in <a href="England">England</a>, and a similar offer to play for the <a href="Providence%20Reds">Providence Reds</a> of the <a href="American%20Hockey%20League">American Hockey League</a>. Plante passed them up because his parents wanted him to finish high school. He graduated with top honours in 1947. Upon graduation, he took a job as a clerk in a Shawinigan factory. A few weeks later, the <a href="Quebec%20Citadelles%23Other%20teams%20with%20the%20same%20name">Quebec Citadels</a> offered Plante $85 per week to play for them; he accepted, marking the beginning of his professional career.

His nickname was "Jake the Snake".

Jacques joined the <a href="Quebec%20Citadelles%23Other%20teams%20with%20the%20same%20name">Quebec Citadelles</a> in 1947. While playing for Quebec, Plante started to play the puck outside his crease, a technique he developed when he recognized that the team's defense was performing poorly. Fans found Plante's unconventional playing style to be exciting, but it angered his managers, who believed that a goaltender should stay in net and let his players recover the puck. Plante had come to the conclusion that as long as he was in control of the puck, the opponents could not shoot it at him – this is now standard practice for goaltenders. The same season, the Citadelles beat the <a href="Montreal%20Junior%20Canadiens">Montreal Junior Canadiens</a> in the league finals, with Plante being named most valuable player on his team. The <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a>' general manager, <a href="Frank%20J.%20Selke">Frank J. Selke</a>, became interested in acquiring Plante as a member of the team. In 1948, Plante received an invitation to the Canadiens' training camp. On August 17, 1949, Selke offered Plante a contract. Plante played for Montreal's affiliate <a href="Royal%20Montreal%20Hockey%20Club">Royal Montreal Hockey Club</a>, earning $4,500 for the season, and an extra $500 for practicing with the Canadiens.

In 1949, he married Jacqueline Gagné; they had two sons, Michel and Richard.

In January 1953, Plante was called up to play for the Canadiens. <a href="Bill%20Durnan">Bill Durnan</a>, the goaltender who played for Montreal when Plante first began, had retired, and <a href="Gerry%20McNeil">Gerry McNeil</a>, their top goaltender, had fractured his jaw. Plante played three games, but in that short time, he generated controversy. Coach <a href="Dick%20Irvin">Dick Irvin, Sr.</a> did not wish his players to stand out by any addition to their regular uniforms. Plante always wore one of his tuques while playing hockey, and after an argument with Irvin, all of Plante's tuques had vanished from the Montreal locker room. Even without his good luck charm, Plante gave up only four goals in the three games he played, all of them wins.

Later during the <a href="1952%E2%80%9353%20NHL%20season">1952–53 NHL season</a>, Plante played in the playoffs against the <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Black Hawks</a>. He won his first playoff game with a shutout. Montreal won that series and eventually the Stanley Cup, and Plante's name was engraved on the Cup for the first time.

At the beginning of 1953, McNeil was still the starting goaltender for the Canadiens. Selke assigned Plante to the <a href="Buffalo%20Bisons%20%28AHL%29">Buffalo Bisons</a> of the <a href="American%20Hockey%20League">American Hockey League</a> so fans in the United States would get to know him. Plante was instantly successful; Fred Hunt, the general manager of the Bisons, told <a href="Kenny%20Reardon">Kenny Reardon</a>, Montreal's recruiting manager, "he's <nowiki>[Plante]</nowiki> the biggest attraction since the good old days of <a href="Terry%20Sawchuk">Terry Sawchuk</a>."

By the end of the <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20NHL%20season">1953–54 season</a>, Plante was well-entrenched within the NHL. In the spring of 1954, he underwent surgery to correct his left hand, which he had broken in his childhood. He could not move the hand well enough to catch high shots and compensated by using the rest of his body. The operation was successful.

On February 12, 1954, Plante was called up to the Canadiens and established himself as their starting goaltender – he did not return to the minor leagues for many years. Plante was the Canadiens' number one goaltender at the beginning of the <a href="1954%E2%80%9355%20NHL%20season">1954–55 NHL season</a>. On March 13, 1955, with only four games left in the season, an on-ice brawl resulted in the suspension of Montreal's leading scorer, <a href="Maurice%20Richard">Maurice Richard</a>, for the rest of the season and the playoffs. Four nights later, playing in Montreal in front of an angry crowd, Plante was witness to the <a href="Richard%20Riot">riot</a> that followed. The Canadiens subsequently lost to the <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a> in the finals.

For the <a href="1955%E2%80%9356%20NHL%20season">1955–56 season</a>, Plante was the unchallenged starting goaltender of the Canadiens; <a href="Gerry%20McNeil">Gerry McNeil</a> had not played the previous season and was sent to the <a href="Royal%20Montreal%20Hockey%20Club">Montreal Royals</a>. <a href="Charlie%20Hodge%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Charlie Hodge</a>, Plante's backup the previous season, was sent to the <a href="Seattle_Totems%23Seattle_Americans_%281955%E2%80%9358%29">Seattle Americans</a>, a Canadiens' farm team. Later that season, Montreal won the Stanley Cup, the first of what would be five consecutive Stanley Cup championship seasons. The <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20NHL%20season">next season</a>, Plante missed most of November because of chronic <a href="bronchitis">bronchitis</a>, a consequence of the asthma that had affected him since childhood. During the <a href="1957%E2%80%9358%20NHL%20season">1957–58 NHL season</a>, the Canadiens won their third straight Stanley Cup despite injuries to Plante and other members of the team. Plante's asthma was getting worse. He sustained a concussion with just a few weeks left in the season and missed three games of the playoffs. In the sixth game of the Stanley Cup finals, Plante's asthma was making him dizzy, and he was having difficulty concentrating; he collapsed at the end of the game after teammate <a href="Doug%20Harvey%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Doug Harvey</a> scored the series-winning goal. The Canadiens went on to win the Stanley Cup again at the close of the <a href="1958-59%20NHL%20season">1958–59 season</a>.

During the <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20NHL%20season">1959-60 season</a>, Plante wore a <a href="goaltender%20mask">goaltender mask</a> for the first time in a regular season game. Although Plante had used his mask in practice since 1956 after missing 13 games because of a <a href="sinusitis">sinusitis</a> operation, head coach <a href="Toe%20Blake">Toe Blake</a> was afraid it would impair his vision and would not permit him to wear it during regulation play. However, on November 1, 1959, Plante's nose was broken when he was hit by a shot fired by <a href="Andy%20Bathgate">Andy Bathgate</a> three minutes into a game against the <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a>, and he was taken to the dressing room for stitches. When he returned, he was wearing the crude home-made goaltender mask that he had been using in practices. Blake was livid, but he had no other goaltender to call upon and Plante refused to return to the goal unless he wore the mask. Blake agreed on the condition that Plante discard the mask when the cut healed. The Canadiens won the game 3–1. During the following days Plante refused to discard the mask, and as the Canadiens continued to win, Blake was less vocal about it. The unbeaten streak stretched to 18 games. Plante did not wear the mask, at Blake's request, against Detroit on March 8, 1960; the Canadiens lost 3–0, and the mask returned for good the next night. That year the Canadiens won their fifth straight Stanley Cup, which was Plante's last.

Plante subsequently designed his own and other goaltenders' masks. He was not the first NHL goaltender known to wear a face mask. <a href="Montreal%20Maroons">Montreal Maroons</a>' <a href="Clint%20Benedict">Clint Benedict</a> wore a crude leather version in 1930 to protect a broken nose, but Plante introduced the mask as everyday equipment, and it is now mandatory <a href="Ice%20hockey%20goaltending%20equipment">equipment for goaltenders</a>.

Hampered by terrible pain in his left knee during the <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20NHL%20season">1960–61 NHL season</a>, Plante was sent down to the minor league Montreal Royals. Torn cartilage was found in his knee, and the knee was surgically repaired during the summer of 1961. The <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20NHL%20season">next season</a> Plante became only the fourth goaltender to win the <a href="Hart%20Memorial%20Trophy">Hart Memorial Trophy</a> – he also won the <a href="Vezina%20Trophy">Vezina Trophy</a> for the sixth time. The <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20NHL%20season">1962–63 season</a> was unsettling for Plante. His asthma had worsened, and he missed most of the early season. His relationship with his coach, <a href="Toe%20Blake">Toe Blake</a>, continued to deteriorate because of Plante's persistent health problems. Later, Plante was at the center of a major controversy when he claimed that net sizes in the NHL were not uniform, thus giving a statistical advantage to goaltenders playing for the <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Black Hawks</a>, <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a>, and <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a>. His claim was later confirmed as the result of a manufacturing error.

After the Canadiens were eliminated for the third straight year in the first playoff round during the spring of 1963, there was mounting pressure for change from their fans and media. Growing tension between Plante and Blake because of Plante's inconsistent work ethic and demeanor caused Blake to declare that for the 1963–64 season either he or Plante must go. On June 4, 1963, Plante was traded to the New York Rangers, with <a href="Phil%20Goyette">Phil Goyette</a> and <a href="Don%20Marshall">Don Marshall</a> in exchange for <a href="Gump%20Worsley">Gump Worsley</a>, <a href="Dave%20Balon">Dave Balon</a>, <a href="Leon%20Rochefort">Leon Rochefort</a>, and <a href="Len%20Ronson">Len Ronson</a>. Plante played for the Rangers for one full season and part of a second. He retired in 1965 while playing for the Rangers' <a href="American%20Hockey%20League">AHL</a> affiliate, the <a href="Baltimore%20Clippers">Baltimore Clippers</a>. His wife was ill at the time, and he required surgery on his right knee.

Upon retirement, Plante took a job with <a href="Molson">Molson</a> as a sales representative but remained active in the NHL. In 1965, <a href="Scotty%20Bowman">Scotty Bowman</a> asked Plante to play for the Montreal Jr. Canadiens in a game against the Soviet National Team. Honoured to represent his country, Plante agreed, and after receiving permission from both the Rangers (who owned his rights) and Molson, he began practicing. The Canadiens won 2–1, and Plante was named first star of the game.

At the beginning of the <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20NHL%20season">1967–68 NHL season</a>, Plante received a call from his ex-teammate <a href="Bert%20Olmstead">Bert Olmstead</a> seeking some help coaching the expansion <a href="Oakland%20Seals">Oakland Seals</a>. Plante coached mainly by example, and after the three-week training camp he returned home to Montreal. Plante also played an exhibition game with the Seals. Rumours swirled that Plante was planning a comeback.

In June 1968, Plante was drafted by the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a> and signed for $35,000 for the <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20NHL%20season">1968–69 season</a>. In his first season with the Blues, Plante split the goaltending duties with <a href="Glenn%20Hall">Glenn Hall</a>. He won the Vezina Trophy that season for the seventh time, surpassing <a href="Bill%20Durnan">Bill Durnan</a>'s record. While playing for the Blues in the 1969–70 playoffs against the Boston Bruins, a shot fired by <a href="Fred%20Stanfield">Fred Stanfield</a> and redirected by <a href="Phil%20Esposito">Phil Esposito</a> hit Plante in the forehead, knocking him out and breaking his fibreglass mask. The first thing Plante said after he regained consciousness at the hospital was that the mask saved his life. That game proved to be his last for the Blues, and he was traded in the summer of 1970 to the Toronto Maple Leafs. He led the NHL with the lowest <a href="goals%20against%20average">goals against average</a> (GAA) during his first season with the Maple Leafs. At season's end, he was named to the NHL's second All-Star team, his seventh such honour. He continued to play for the Leafs until he was traded to the <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a> late in the 1972–73 season, recording a shutout against the Black Hawks in his debut for the Bruins. He played eight regular season and two playoff games for the Bruins to finish that season, his last in the NHL.

Plante accepted a $10 million, 10-year contract to become coach and general manager of the <a href="Quebec%20Nordiques">Quebec Nordiques</a> of the <a href="World%20Hockey%20Association">World Hockey Association</a> in 1973. He was highly dissatisfied with his and the team's performance and resigned at the end of the 1973–74 season. Coming out of retirement once more, Plante played 31 games for the <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a> of the WHA in the 1974–75 season. Plante retired during the Oilers' training camp in 1975–76 after receiving news that his youngest son had died.

Plante had a well-earned reputation for his ability to analyse the game of hockey. He began shouting directions to his teammates during games in his first stint in the minor leagues (the goaltender usually has the best view of the game). He kept extensive notes on opposing players and teams throughout his career. He made his debut in the broadcasting booth during his first retirement in the 1960s as a colour commentator for broadcasts of <a href="Quebec%20Major%20Junior%20Hockey%20League%23History">Quebec Junior League</a> games alongside <a href="Danny%20Gallivan">Danny Gallivan</a> of <a href="Hockey%20Night%20in%20Canada">Hockey Night in Canada</a> fame. <a href="T%C3%A9l%C3%A9vision%20de%20Radio-Canada">Radio Canada</a>, the French language branch of the <a href="Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a>, brought Plante aboard as on-air analyst for its television broadcasts of the <a href="Summit%20Series">1972 Summit Series</a> between the national team of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> and a Canadian team made up of professional players from the NHL. Plante was one of the few North American analysts who dissented from the widely held belief in the superiority of the Canadian team.

Plante also wrote extensively on hockey. He wrote hockey columns starting early in his career and was published in "La Voix de Shawinigan", "Le Samedi", and "Sport Magazine." He alienated local reporters by writing a column for the local paper during his time as coach of the Quebec Nordiques. His seminal work, "Goaltending", was published in 1972 in English, with the French edition (entitled "Devant le filet") published in 1973. In his book, Plante outlined a program of goaltender development that included off-ice exercises, choice of equipment, styles of play, and game-day preparation. He also advised on best coaching methods for both young and advanced goaltenders. His book remained popular with coaches and players and was reprinted in both French and English in 1997, 25 years after it was first published.

Starting in 1967, Plante was one of the instructors at "École moderne de hockey," a summer hockey school for young players. His reputation as a teacher spread, and he traveled to <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> in 1972 at the invitation of the Swedish Hockey Federation, teaching the top goaltenders in the country and their coaches and trainers. During his first and second retirements, Plante also coached goaltenders and consulted for several NHL teams, including the <a href="California%20Golden%20Seals">Oakland Seals</a>, <a href="Philadelphia%20Flyers">Philadelphia Flyers</a>, Montreal Canadiens and St. Louis Blues.

Plante finally retired from hockey in 1975, after the death of his youngest son. He moved to <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> with his second wife, Raymonde Udrisard, but remained active on the North American hockey scene as an analyst, adviser, and goaltender trainer. He was inducted into the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> in 1978. In the fall of 1985, Plante was diagnosed with terminal <a href="stomach%20cancer">stomach cancer</a>. He died in a <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> hospital in February 1986 and was buried in <a href="Sierre">Sierre</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. When his coffin was carried from the church following the funeral mass, it passed under an arch of hockey sticks held high by a team of young hockey players from Quebec, visiting Switzerland for a tournament.

John Gielgud

Sir Arthur John Gielgud, <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">OM</a>, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Companions%20of%20Honour">CH</a> (14 April 1904 – 21 May 2000) was an English actor and <a href="theatre%20director">theatre director</a> whose career spanned eight decades, and who, along with his contemporaries <a href="Peggy%20Ashcroft">Peggy Ashcroft</a>, <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>, and <a href="Ralph%20Richardson">Ralph Richardson</a>, dominated the <a href="Theatre%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British stage</a> of much of the 20th century. A member of the <a href="Terry%20family">Terry family</a> theatrical dynasty, he gained his first paid acting work as a junior member of his cousin <a href="Phyllis%20Neilson-Terry">Phyllis Neilson-Terry</a>'s company in 1922. After studying at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Dramatic%20Art">Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</a> he worked in <a href="repertory%20theatre">repertory theatre</a> and in the <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> before establishing himself at the <a href="Old%20Vic">Old Vic</a> as an exponent of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> in 1929–31.

During the 1930s Gielgud was a stage star in the West End and on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a>, appearing in new works and classics. He began a parallel career as a director, and set up his own company at the <a href="Queen%27s%20Theatre">Queen's Theatre</a>, London. He was regarded by many as the finest <a href="Prince%20Hamlet">Hamlet</a> of his era, and was also known for high comedy roles such as John Worthing in "<a href="The%20Importance%20of%20Being%20Earnest">The Importance of Being Earnest</a>". In the 1950s Gielgud feared that his career was threatened when he was convicted and fined for a homosexual offence, but his colleagues and the public supported him loyally. When "" plays began to supersede traditional West End productions in the later 1950s he found no new suitable stage roles, and for several years he was best known in the theatre for his one-man Shakespeare show "<a href="The%20Ages%20of%20Man%20%28play%29">Ages of Man</a>". From the late 1960s he found new plays that suited him, by authors including <a href="Alan%20Bennett">Alan Bennett</a>, <a href="David%20Storey">David Storey</a> and <a href="Harold%20Pinter">Harold Pinter</a>.

During the first half of his career, Gielgud did not take the cinema seriously. Though he made his first film in 1924, and had successes with "<a href="The%20Good%20Companions%20%281933%20film%29">The Good Companions</a>" (1933) and "<a href="Julius%20Caesar%20%281953%20film%29">Julius Caesar</a>" (1953), he did not begin a regular film career until his sixties. Gielgud appeared in more than sixty films between "<a href="Becket%20%281964%20film%29">Becket</a>" (1964), for which he received his first <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> nomination for playing <a href="Louis%20VII%20of%20France">Louis VII of France</a>, and "<a href="Elizabeth%20%28film%29">Elizabeth</a>" (1998). As the acid-tongued Hobson in "<a href="Arthur%20%281981%20film%29">Arthur</a>" (1981) he won the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor</a>. His film work further earned him a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a> and two <a href="British%20Academy%20Film%20Awards">BAFTAs</a>.

Although largely indifferent to awards, Gielgud had the rare distinction of winning an <a href="List%20of%20people%20who%20have%20won%20Academy%2C%20Emmy%2C%20Grammy%2C%20and%20Tony%20Awards">Oscar, an Emmy, a Grammy, and a Tony</a>. He was famous from the start of his career for his voice and his mastery of Shakespearean verse. He broadcast more than a hundred radio and television dramas between 1929 and 1994, and made commercial recordings of many plays, including ten of Shakespeare's. Among his honours, he was <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a> in 1953 and the <a href="Gielgud%20Theatre">Gielgud Theatre</a> was named after him. From 1977 to 1989, he was president of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

Gielgud was born in <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a>, London, the third of the four children and youngest of three sons of Frank Henry Gielgud (1860–1949) and his second wife, Kate Terry-Gielgud, "née" Terry-Lewis (1868–1958). The two elder boys were <a href="Lewis%20Gielgud">Lewis</a>, who became a senior official of the <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Societies">Red Cross</a> and <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>, and <a href="Val%20Gielgud">Val</a>, later head of <a href="BBC">BBC</a> radio drama; their sister Eleanor became John's secretary for many years. On his father's side, Gielgud was of Lithuanian and Polish descent. The surname derives from <a href="Gelgaudi%C5%A1kis">Gelgaudiškis</a>, a village in Lithuania. The Counts Gielgud had owned the Gielgudziszki Castle on the <a href="Neman%20River">River Niemen</a>, but their estates were confiscated after they took part in a <a href="November%20Uprising">failed uprising against Russian rule</a> in 1830–31. Jan Gielgud took refuge in England with his family; one of his grandchildren was Frank Gielgud, whose maternal grandmother was a famous Polish actress, <a href="Aniela%20Aszpergerowa">Aniela Aszpergerowa</a>.
Frank married into <a href="Terry%20family">a family with wide theatrical connections</a>. His wife, who was on the stage until she married, was the daughter of the actress <a href="Kate%20Terry">Kate Terry</a>, and a member of the stage dynasty that included <a href="Ellen%20Terry">Ellen</a>, <a href="Fred%20Terry">Fred</a> and <a href="Marion%20Terry">Marion Terry</a>, <a href="Mabel%20Terry-Lewis">Mabel Terry-Lewis</a> and <a href="Edith%20Craig">Edith</a> and <a href="Edward%20Gordon%20Craig">Edward Gordon Craig</a>. Frank had no theatrical ambitions and worked all his life as a stockbroker in the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>.

In 1912, aged eight, Gielgud went to Hillside <a href="preparatory%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">preparatory school</a> in <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a> as his elder brothers had done. For a child with no interest in sport he acquitted himself reasonably well in <a href="cricket">cricket</a> and <a href="rugby%20football">rugby</a> for the school. In class, he hated mathematics, was fair at <a href="classics">classics</a>, and excelled at English and <a href="divinity%20%28academic%20discipline%29">divinity</a>. Hillside encouraged his interest in drama, and he played several leading roles in school productions, including <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a> in "<a href="Julius%20Caesar%20%28play%29">Julius Caesar</a>" and <a href="Shylock">Shylock</a> in "<a href="The%20Merchant%20of%20Venice">The Merchant of Venice</a>".

After Hillside, Lewis and Val had won scholarships to <a href="Eton%20College">Eton</a> and <a href="Rugby%20School">Rugby</a>, respectively; lacking their academic achievement, John failed to secure such a scholarship. He was sent as a <a href="day%20pupil">day boy</a> to <a href="Westminster%20School">Westminster School</a> where, as he later said, he had access to the <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> "in time to touch the fringe of the great century of the theatre". He saw <a href="Sarah%20Bernhardt">Sarah Bernhardt</a> act, <a href="Adeline%20Gen%C3%A9e">Adeline Genée</a> dance and <a href="Albert%20Chevalier">Albert Chevalier</a>, <a href="Vesta%20Tilley">Vesta Tilley</a> and <a href="Marie%20Lloyd">Marie Lloyd</a> perform in the <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a>s. The school choir sang in services at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, which appealed to his fondness for ritual. He showed talent at sketching, and for a while thought of <a href="scenic%20design">scenic design</a> as a possible career.

The young Gielgud's father took him to concerts, which he liked, and galleries and museums, "which bored me rigid". Both parents were keen theatregoers, but did not encourage their children to follow an acting career. Val Gielgud recalled, "Our parents looked distinctly sideways at the Stage as a means of livelihood, and when John showed some talent for drawing his father spoke crisply of the advantages of an architect's office." On leaving Westminster in 1921, Gielgud persuaded his reluctant parents to let him take drama lessons on the understanding that if he was not self-supporting by the age of twenty-five he would seek an office post.

Gielgud, aged seventeen, joined a private drama school run by Constance Benson, wife of the <a href="actor-manager">actor-manager</a> <a href="Frank%20Benson%20%28actor%29">Sir Frank Benson</a>. On the new boy's first day Lady Benson remarked on his physical awkwardness: "she said I walked like a cat with <a href="rickets">rickets</a>. It dealt a severe blow to my conceit, which was a good thing." Before and after joining the school he played in several amateur productions, and in November 1921 made his debut with a professional company, though he himself was not paid. He played the Herald in "<a href="Henry%20V%20%28play%29">Henry V</a>" at the <a href="Old%20Vic">Old Vic</a>; he had one line to speak and, he recalled, spoke it badly. He was kept on for the rest of the season in walk-on parts in "<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>", "Wat Tyler" and "<a href="Peer%20Gynt">Peer Gynt</a>", with no lines.
Gielgud's first substantial engagement came through his family. In 1922 his cousin <a href="Phyllis%20Neilson-Terry">Phyllis Neilson-Terry</a> invited him to tour in <a href="J.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BB.%20Fagan">J. B. Fagan</a>'s "The Wheel", as <a href="understudy">understudy</a>, bit-part player and assistant stage manager, an invitation he accepted. A colleague, recognising that the young man had talent but lacked technique, recommended him to the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Dramatic%20Art">Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</a> (RADA). Gielgud was awarded a scholarship to the academy and trained there throughout 1923 under <a href="Kenneth%20Barnes">Kenneth Barnes</a>, <a href="Helen%20Haye">Helen Haye</a> and <a href="Claude%20Rains">Claude Rains</a>.

The actor-manager <a href="Nigel%20Playfair">Nigel Playfair</a>, a friend of Gielgud's family, saw him in a student presentation of <a href="J.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BM.%20Barrie">J. M. Barrie</a>'s "<a href="The%20Admirable%20Crichton">The Admirable Crichton</a>". Playfair was impressed and cast him as Felix, the poet-butterfly, in the British premiere of the Čapek brothers' "<a href="Pictures%20from%20the%20Insects%27%20Life">The Insect Play</a>". Gielgud later said that he made a poor impression in the part: "I am surprised that the audience did not throw things at me." The critics were cautious but not hostile to the play; it did not attract the public and closed after a month. While still continuing his studies at RADA, Gielgud appeared again for Playfair in "RobertE Lee" by <a href="John%20Drinkwater%20%28playwright%29">John Drinkwater</a>. After leaving the academy at the end of 1923 Gielgud played a Christmas season as Charley in "<a href="Charley%27s%20Aunt">Charley's Aunt</a>" in the West End, and then joined Fagan's <a href="repertory%20theatre">repertory</a> company at the <a href="Oxford%20Playhouse">Oxford Playhouse</a>.

Gielgud was in the Oxford company in January and February 1924, from October 1924 to the end of January 1925, and in August 1925. He played a wide range of parts in classics and modern plays, greatly increasing his technical abilities in the process. The role he most enjoyed was Trofimov in "<a href="The%20Cherry%20Orchard">The Cherry Orchard</a>", his first experience of <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Chekhov</a>: "It was the first time I ever went out on stage feeling that perhaps, after all, I could really be an actor."

Between Gielgud's first two Oxford seasons, the producer <a href="Barry%20Jackson%20%28director%29">Barry Jackson</a> cast him as <a href="Romeo">Romeo</a> to the <a href="Juliet">Juliet</a> of <a href="Gwen%20Ffrangcon-Davies">Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies</a> at the Regent's Theatre, London, in May 1924. The production was not a great success, but the two performers became close friends and frequently worked together throughout their careers. Gielgud made his screen debut during 1924 as Daniel Arnault in <a href="Walter%20Summers">Walter Summers</a>'s silent film "<a href="Who%20Is%20the%20Man%3F">Who Is the Man?</a>" (1924).
In May 1925 the Oxford production of "The Cherry Orchard" was brought to the <a href="Lyric%20Theatre%2C%20Hammersmith">Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith</a>. Gielgud again played Trofimov. His distinctive speaking voice attracted attention and led to work for <a href="BBC%20Radio">BBC Radio</a>, which his biographer <a href="Sheridan%20Morley">Sheridan Morley</a> calls "a medium he made his own for seventy years". In the same year <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a> chose Gielgud as his understudy in his play "<a href="The%20Vortex">The Vortex</a>". For the last month of the West End run Gielgud took over Coward's role of Nicky Lancaster, the drug-addicted son of a nymphomaniac mother. It was in Gielgud's words "a highly-strung, nervous, hysterical part which depended a lot upon emotion". He found it tiring to play because he had not yet learned how to pace himself, but he thought it "a thrilling engagement because it led to so many great things afterwards".

The success of "The Cherry Orchard" led to what one critic called a "Chekhov boom" in British theatres, and Gielgud was among its leading players. As Konstantin in "<a href="The%20Seagull">The Seagull</a>" in October 1925 he impressed the Russian director <a href="Theodore%20Komisarjevsky">Theodore Komisarjevsky</a>, who cast him as Tusenbach in the British premiere of "<a href="Three%20Sisters%20%28play%29">Three Sisters</a>". The production received enthusiastic reviews, and Gielgud's highly praised performance enhanced his reputation as a potential star. There followed three years of mixed fortunes for him, with successes in fringe productions, but West End stardom was elusive.

In 1926 the producer <a href="Basil%20Dean">Basil Dean</a> offered Gielgud the lead role, Lewis Dodd, in a dramatisation of <a href="Margaret%20Kennedy">Margaret Kennedy</a>'s best-selling novel, "<a href="The%20Constant%20Nymph%20%28novel%29">The Constant Nymph</a>". Before rehearsals began Dean found that a bigger star than Gielgud was available, namely Coward, to whom he gave the part. Gielgud had an enforceable contractual claim to the role, but Dean, a notorious bully, was a powerful force in British theatre. Intimidated, Gielgud accepted the position of understudy, with a guarantee that he would take over the lead from Coward when the latter, who disliked playing in long runs, left. In the event Coward, who had been overworking, suffered a nervous collapse three weeks after the opening night, and Gielgud played the lead for the rest of the run. The play ran for nearly a year in London and then went on tour.

By this time Gielgud was earning enough to leave the family home and take a small flat in the West End. He had his first serious romantic relationship, living with John Perry, an unsuccessful actor, later a writer, who remained a lifelong friend after their affair ended. Morley makes the point that, like Coward, Gielgud's principal passion was the stage; both men had casual dalliances, but were more comfortable with "low-maintenance" long-term partners who did not impede their theatrical work and ambitions.

In 1928 Gielgud made his <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> debut as the <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Alexander</a> in <a href="Alfred%20Neumann%20%28writer%29">Alfred Neumann</a>'s "The Patriot". The play was a failure, closing after a week, but Gielgud liked New York and received favourable reviews from critics including <a href="Alexander%20Woollcott">Alexander Woollcott</a> and <a href="Brooks%20Atkinson">Brooks Atkinson</a>. After returning to London he starred in a succession of short runs, including <a href="Henrik%20Ibsen">Ibsen</a>'s "<a href="Ghosts%20%28play%29">Ghosts</a>" with <a href="Mrs%20Patrick%20Campbell">Mrs Patrick Campbell</a> (1928), and <a href="Reginald%20Berkeley">Reginald Berkeley</a>'s "The Lady with a Lamp" (1929) with <a href="Edith%20Evans">Edith Evans</a> and Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies. In 1928 he made his second film, "<a href="The%20Clue%20of%20the%20New%20Pin%20%281929%20film%29">The Clue of the New Pin</a>". This, billed as "the first British full-length <a href="sound%20film">talkie</a>", was an adaptation of an <a href="Edgar%20Wallace">Edgar Wallace</a> mystery story; Gielgud played a young scoundrel who commits two murders and very nearly a third before he himself is killed.

In 1929 <a href="Harcourt%20Williams">Harcourt Williams</a>, newly appointed as director of productions at the Old Vic, invited Gielgud to join the company for the forthcoming season. The Old Vic, in an unfashionable area of London south of the <a href="River%20Thames">Thames</a>, was run by <a href="Lilian%20Baylis">Lilian Baylis</a> to offer plays and operas to a mostly working-class audience at low ticket prices. She paid her performers very modest wages, but the theatre was known for its unrivalled repertory of classics, mostly <a href="Shakespeare%27s%20plays">Shakespeare</a>, and Gielgud was not the first West End star to take a large pay cut to work there. It was, in Morley's words, the place to learn Shakespearean technique and try new ideas.
During his first season at the Old Vic, Gielgud played Romeo to the Juliet of <a href="Adele%20Dixon">Adele Dixon</a>, <a href="Antonio%20%28The%20Merchant%20of%20Venice%29">Antonio</a> in "The Merchant of Venice", Cleante in "<a href="The%20Imaginary%20Invalid">The Imaginary Invalid</a>", the <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20England">title role</a> in "<a href="Richard%20II%20%28play%29">Richard II</a>", and <a href="Oberon">Oberon</a> in "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>". His Romeo was not well reviewed, but as Richard II Gielgud was recognised by critics as a Shakespearean actor of undoubted authority. The reviewer in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" commented on his sensitiveness, strength and firmness, and called his performance "work of genuine distinction, not only in its grasp of character, but in its control of language". Later in the season he was cast as Mark Antony in "Julius Caesar", <a href="Orlando%20%28As%20You%20Like%20It%29">Orlando</a> in "<a href="As%20You%20Like%20It">As You Like It</a>", the <a href="Caesar%20%28title%29">Emperor</a> in "<a href="Androcles%20and%20the%20Lion%20%28play%29">Androcles and the Lion</a>" and the title role in <a href="Luigi%20Pirandello">Pirandello</a>'s "<a href="The%20Man%20with%20the%20Flower%20in%20His%20Mouth">The Man with the Flower in His Mouth</a>".

In April 1930 Gielgud finished the season <a href="Hamlet%20in%20performance">playing Hamlet</a>. Williams's production used the complete text of the play. This was regarded as a radical innovation; extensive cuts had been customary for earlier productions. A running time of nearly five hours did not dampen the enthusiasm of the public, the critics or the acting profession. <a href="Sybil%20Thorndike">Sybil Thorndike</a> said, "I never hoped to see Hamlet played as in one's dreams ... I've had an evening of being swept right off my feet into another life – far more real than the life I live in, and moved, moved beyond words." The production gained such a reputation that the Old Vic began to attract large numbers of West End theatregoers. Demand was so great that the cast moved to the <a href="Queen%27s%20Theatre">Queen's Theatre</a> in <a href="Shaftesbury%20Avenue">Shaftesbury Avenue</a>, where Williams staged the piece with the text discreetly shortened. The effect of the cuts was to give the title role even more prominence. Gielgud's Hamlet was richly praised by the critics. <a href="Ivor%20Brown">Ivor Brown</a> called it "a tremendous performance ... the best Hamlet of [my] experience". <a href="James%20Agate">James Agate</a> wrote, "I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that it is the high water-mark of English Shakespearean acting of our time."
Hamlet was a role with which Gielgud was associated over the next decade and more. After the run at the Queen's finished he turned to another part for which he became well known, John Worthing in "<a href="The%20Importance%20of%20Being%20Earnest">The Importance of Being Earnest</a>". Gielgud's biographer <a href="Jonathan%20Croall">Jonathan Croall</a> comments that the two roles illustrated two sides of the actor's personality: on the one hand the romantic and soulful Hamlet, and on the other the witty and superficial Worthing. The formidable Lady Bracknell was played by his aunt, Mabel Terry-Lewis. "The Times" observed, "Mr Gielgud and Miss Terry-Lewis together are brilliant ... they have the supreme grace of always allowing <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Wilde</a> to speak in his own voice."

Returning to the Old Vic for the 1930–31 season, Gielgud found several changes to the company. <a href="Donald%20Wolfit">Donald Wolfit</a>, who loathed him and was himself disliked by his colleagues, was dropped, as was Adele Dixon. Gielgud was uncertain of the suitability of the most prominent new recruit, <a href="Ralph%20Richardson">Ralph Richardson</a>, but Williams was sure that after this season Gielgud would move on; he saw Richardson as a potential replacement. The two actors had little in common. Richardson recalled, "He was a kind of brilliant butterfly, while I was a very gloomy sort of boy", and "I found his clothes extravagant, I found his conversation flippant. He was the New Young Man of his time and I didn't like him." The first production of the season was "<a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%201">Henry IV, Part 1</a>", in which Gielgud as <a href="Henry%20Percy%20%28Hotspur%29">Hotspur</a> had the best of the reviews. Richardson's notices, and the relationship of the two leading men, improved markedly when Gielgud, who was playing <a href="Prospero">Prospero</a> in "<a href="The%20Tempest">The Tempest</a>", helped Richardson with his performance as <a href="Caliban">Caliban</a>:
The friendship and professional association lasted for more than fifty years, until the end of Richardson's life. Gielgud's other roles in this season were Lord Trinket in "<a href="The%20Jealous%20Wife">The Jealous Wife</a>", Richard II again, Antony in "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>", <a href="Malvolio">Malvolio</a> in "<a href="Twelfth%20Night">Twelfth Night</a>", Sergius in "<a href="Arms%20and%20the%20Man">Arms and the Man</a>", Benedick in "<a href="Much%20Ado%20About%20Nothing">Much Ado About Nothing</a>" – another role for which he became celebrated – and he concluded the season as <a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>. His performance divided opinion. "The Times" commented, "It is a mountain of a part, and at the end of the evening the peak remains unscaled"; in "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>", however, Brown wrote that Gielgud "is a match for the thunder, and at length takes the Dover road with a broken tranquillity that allowed every word of the King's agony to be clear as well as poignant".

Returning to the West End, Gielgud starred in <a href="J.B.%20Priestley">JBPriestley</a>'s "<a href="The%20Good%20Companions">The Good Companions</a>", adapted for the stage by the author and <a href="Edward%20Knoblock">Edward Knoblock</a>. The production ran from May 1931 for 331 performances, and Gielgud described it as his first real taste of commercial success. He played Inigo Jollifant, a young schoolmaster who abandons teaching to join a travelling theatre troupe. This crowd-pleaser drew disapproval from the more austere reviewers, who felt Gielgud should be doing something more demanding, but he found playing a conventional juvenile lead had challenges of its own and helped him improve his technique. During the run of the play he made another film, "<a href="Insult%20%28film%29">Insult</a>" (1932), a <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a> about the <a href="French%20Foreign%20Legion">French Foreign Legion</a>, and he starred in <a href="The%20Good%20Companions%20%281933%20film%29">a cinema version</a> of "The Good Companions" in 1933, with <a href="Jessie%20Matthews">Jessie Matthews</a>. A letter to a friend reveals Gielgud's view of film acting: "There is talk of my doing Inigo in the film of "The Good Companions", which appals my soul but appeals to my pocket." In his first volume of memoirs, published in 1939, Gielgud devoted two pages to describing the things about filming that he detested. Unlike his contemporaries Richardson and <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>, he made few films until after the Second World War, and did not establish himself as a prominent film actor until many years after that. As he put it in 1994, "I was stupid enough to toss my head and stick to the stage while watching Larry and Ralph sign lucrative <a href="Alexander%20Korda">Korda</a> contracts."
In 1932 Gielgud turned to directing. At the invitation of <a href="George%20Devine">George Devine</a>, the president of the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Dramatic%20Society">Oxford University Dramatic Society</a>, Gielgud took charge of a production of "Romeo and Juliet" by the society, featuring two guest stars: <a href="Peggy%20Ashcroft">Peggy Ashcroft</a> as Juliet and Edith Evans as the Nurse. The rest of the cast were students, led by <a href="Christopher%20Hassall">Christopher Hassall</a> as Romeo, and included Devine, <a href="William%20Devlin%20%28actor%29">William Devlin</a> and <a href="Terence%20Rattigan">Terence Rattigan</a>. The experience was satisfactory to Gielgud: he enjoyed the attentions of the undergraduates, had a brief affair with one of them, <a href="James%20Lees-Milne">James Lees-Milne</a>, and was widely praised for his inspiring direction and his protégés' success with the play. Already notorious for his innocent slips of the tongue (he called them "Gielgoofs"), in a speech after the final performance he referred to Ashcroft and Evans as "Two leading ladies, the like of whom I hope I shall never meet again".

During the rest of 1932 Gielgud played in a new piece, "Musical Chairs" by Ronald Mackenzie, and directed one new and one classic play, "Strange Orchestra" by <a href="Rodney%20Ackland">Rodney Ackland</a> in the West End, and "The Merchant of Venice" at the Old Vic, with <a href="Malcolm%20Keen">Malcolm Keen</a> as Shylock and Ashcroft as Portia. In 1932 he starred in "<a href="Richard%20of%20Bordeaux%20%28play%29">Richard of Bordeaux</a>" by <a href="Josephine%20Tey">Elizabeth MacKintosh</a>. This, a retelling in modern language of the events of "Richard II", was greeted as the most successful historical play since Shaw's "<a href="Saint%20Joan%20%28play%29">Saint Joan</a>" nine years earlier, more faithful to the events than Shakespeare had been. After an uncertain start in the West End it rapidly became a sell-out hit and played in London and on tour over the next three years.

Between seasons of "Richard", in 1934 Gielgud returned to "Hamlet" in London and on tour, directing and playing the title role. The production was a box-office success, and the critics were lavish in their praise. In "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Charles%20Langbridge%20Morgan">Charles Morgan</a> wrote, "I have never before heard the rhythm and verse and the naturalness of speech so gently combined. ... If I see a better performance of this play than this before I die, it will be a miracle." Morley writes that junior members of the cast such as <a href="Alec%20Guinness">Alec Guinness</a> and <a href="Frith%20Banbury">Frith Banbury</a> would gather in the wings every night "to watch what they seemed intuitively already to know was to be the Hamlet of their time".
The following year Gielgud staged perhaps his most famous Shakespeare production, a "Romeo and Juliet" in which he co-starred with Ashcroft and Olivier. Gielgud had spotted Olivier's potential and gave him a major step up in his career. For the first weeks of the run Gielgud played <a href="Mercutio">Mercutio</a> and Olivier played Romeo, after which they exchanged roles. As at Oxford, Ashcroft and Evans were Juliet and the nurse. The production broke all box-office records for the play, running at the <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward%20Theatre">New Theatre</a> for 189 performances. Olivier was enraged at the notices after the first night, which praised the virility of his performance but fiercely criticised his speaking of Shakespeare's verse, comparing it with his co-star's mastery of the poetry. The friendship between the two men was prickly, on Olivier's side, for the rest of his life.
In May 1936 Gielgud played Trigorin in "The Seagull", with Evans as Arkadina and Ashcroft as Nina. Komisarjevsky directed, which made rehearsals difficult as Ashcroft, with whom he had been living, had just left him. Nonetheless, Morley writes, the critical reception was ecstatic. In the same year Gielgud made his last pre-war film, co-starring with <a href="Madeleine%20Carroll">Madeleine Carroll</a> in <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s "<a href="Secret%20Agent%20%281936%20film%29">Secret Agent</a>". The director's insensitivity to actors made Gielgud nervous and further increased his dislike of filming. The two stars were praised for their performances, but Hitchcock's "preoccupation with incident" was felt by critics to make the leading roles one-dimensional, and the laurels went to <a href="Peter%20Lorre">Peter Lorre</a> as Gielgud's deranged assistant.

From September 1936 to February 1937 Gielgud played Hamlet in North America, opening in Toronto before moving to New York and Boston. He was nervous about starring on Broadway for the first time, particularly as it became known that the popular actor <a href="Leslie%20Howard%20%28actor%29">Leslie Howard</a> was to appear there in a rival production of the play. When Gielgud opened at the <a href="Empire%20Theatre%20%2841st%20Street%29">Empire Theatre</a> in October the reviews were mixed, but, as the actor wrote to his mother, the audience response was extraordinary. "They stay at the end and shout every night and the stage door is beset by fans." Howard's production opened in November; it was, in Gielgud's words, a débâcle, and the "battle of the Hamlets" heralded in the New York press was over almost as soon as it had begun. Howard's version closed within a month; the run of Gielgud's production beat Broadway records for the play.

After his return from America in February 1937 Gielgud starred in "He Was Born Gay" by <a href="Emlyn%20Williams">Emlyn Williams</a>. This romantic tragedy about French royalty after the <a href="French%20Revolution">Revolution</a> was quite well received during its pre-London tour, but was savaged by the critics in the West End. "The Times" said, "This is one of those occasions on which criticism does not stand about talking, but rubs its eyes and withdraws hastily with an embarrassed, incredulous, and uncomprehending blush. What made Mr Emlyn Williams write this play or Mr Gielgud and Miss Ffrangcon-Davies appear in it is not to be understood." The play closed after twelve performances. Its failure, so soon after his Shakespearean triumphs, prompted Gielgud to examine his career and his life. His domestic relationship with Perry was comfortable but unexciting, he saw no future in a film career, and the Old Vic could not afford to stage the classics on the large scale to which he aspired. He decided that he must form his own company to play Shakespeare and other classic plays in the West End.

Gielgud invested £5,000, most of his earnings from the American "Hamlet"; Perry, who had family money, put in the same sum. From September 1937 to April 1938 Gielgud was the tenant of the Queen's Theatre, where he presented a season consisting of "Richard II", "<a href="The%20School%20for%20Scandal">The School for Scandal</a>", "Three Sisters", and "The Merchant of Venice". His company included <a href="Harry%20Andrews">Harry Andrews</a>, Peggy Ashcroft, <a href="Glen%20Byam%20Shaw">Glen Byam Shaw</a>, George Devine, <a href="Michael%20Redgrave">Michael Redgrave</a> and Harcourt Williams, with <a href="Angela%20Baddeley">Angela Baddeley</a> and Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies as guests. His own roles were King Richard, Joseph Surface, Vershinin and Shylock. Gielgud's performances drew superlatives from reviewers and colleagues. Agate considered his Richard II, "probably the best piece of Shakespearean acting on the English stage today". Olivier said that Gielgud's Joseph Surface was "the best light comedy performance I've ever seen, or ever shall see".

The venture did not make much money, and in July 1938 Gielgud turned to more conventional West End enterprises, in unconventional circumstances. He directed "<a href="Spring%20Meeting%20%28play%29">Spring Meeting</a>", a farce by Perry and <a href="Molly%20Keane">Molly Keane</a>, presented by <a href="Binkie%20Beaumont">Binkie Beaumont</a>, for whom Perry had just left Gielgud. Somehow the three men remained on excellent terms. In September of the same year Gielgud appeared in <a href="Dodie%20Smith">Dodie Smith</a>'s sentimental comedy "<a href="Dear%20Octopus">Dear Octopus</a>". The following year he directed and appeared in "The Importance of Being Earnest" at the Queen's, with Evans playing Lady Bracknell for the first time. They were gratified when <a href="Allan%20Aynesworth">Allan Aynesworth</a>, who had played Algernon in the 1895 premiere, said that the new production "caught the gaiety and exactly the right atmosphere. It's all delightful!"

At the start of the Second World War Gielgud volunteered for active service, but was told that men of his age, thirty-five, would not be wanted for at least six months. The government quickly came to the view that most actors would do more good performing to entertain the troops and the general public than serving, whether suitable or not, in the armed forces.

Gielgud directed Michael Redgrave in a 1940 London production of "<a href="The%20Beggar%27s%20Opera">The Beggar's Opera</a>" for the <a href="Glyndebourne%20Festival%20Opera">Glyndebourne Festival</a>. This was a chaotic affair: Gielgud's direction confused his star, and when Redgrave lost his voice Gielgud had to step in and sing the role as best he could. Gielgud felt that something serious or even solemn was necessary for <a href="The%20Blitz">wartime London</a>, where most entertainment was light-hearted. Together with <a href="Harley%20Granville-Barker">Harley Granville-Barker</a> and Guthrie he reopened the Old Vic with Shakespeare. His King Lear once again divided the critics, but his Prospero was a considerable success. He played the role quite differently from his attempt on the same stage in 1930: in place of the "manic conjurer" his Prospero was "very far from the usual mixture of Father Christmas, a Colonial Bishop, and the President of the Magicians' Union ... a clear, arresting picture of a virile Renaissance notable", according to Brown. The critics singled out, among the other players, <a href="Jack%20Hawkins">Jack Hawkins</a> as Caliban, <a href="Marius%20Goring">Marius Goring</a> as Ariel, <a href="Jessica%20Tandy">Jessica Tandy</a> as Miranda and Alec Guinness as Ferdinand.

Following the example of several of his stage colleagues, Gielgud joined tours of military camps. He gave recitals of prose and poetry, and acted in a triple bill of short plays, including two from Coward's "<a href="Tonight%20at%208.30">Tonight at 8.30</a>", but he found at first that less highbrow performers like <a href="Beatrice%20Lillie">Beatrice Lillie</a> were better than he at entertaining the troops. He returned to filming in 1940, as <a href="Benjamin%20Disraeli">Disraeli</a> in <a href="Thorold%20Dickinson">Thorold Dickinson</a>'s "<a href="The%20Prime%20Minister%20%28film%29">The Prime Minister</a>". In this morale-boosting film he portrayed the politician from ages thirty to seventy; this was, in Morley's view, the first time he seemed at home before the camera. Gielgud made no more films for the next ten years; he turned down the role of <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> in the <a href="Caesar%20and%20Cleopatra%20%28film%29">1945 film</a> of Shaw's "<a href="Caesar%20and%20Cleopatra%20%28play%29">Caesar and Cleopatra</a>" with <a href="Vivien%20Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a>. He and Leigh were close friends, and Shaw tried hard to persuade him to play the part, but Gielgud had taken a strong dislike to the director, <a href="Gabriel%20Pascal">Gabriel Pascal</a>. Caesar was eventually played by Gielgud's former teacher, Claude Rains.

Throughout 1941 and 1942 Gielgud worked continually, in Barrie's "Dear Brutus", another "Importance of Being Earnest" in the West End, and "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>" on tour. Returning, with more assurance than before, to entertaining the troops, he so far departed from his classical style as to join Lillie and <a href="Michael%20Wilding%20%28actor%29">Michael Wilding</a> singing a comic trio. His 1943 revival of <a href="William%20Congreve">William Congreve</a>'s "<a href="Love%20for%20Love">Love for Love</a>" on tour and then in London received high praise from reviewers. In 1944 he was approached by Ralph Richardson, who had been asked by the governors of the Old Vic to form a new company. Unwilling to take sole charge, Richardson proposed a managing triumvirate of Gielgud, Olivier and himself. Gielgud declined: "It would be a disaster, you would have to spend your whole time as referee between Larry and me."

A 1944–45 season at the <a href="Haymarket%20Theatre">Haymarket</a> for Beaumont included a Hamlet that many considered his finest. Agate wrote, "Mr Gielgud is now completely and authoritatively master of this tremendous part... I hold that this is, and is likely to remain, the best Hamlet of our time." Also in the season were "A Midsummer Night's Dream", "<a href="The%20Duchess%20of%20Malfi">The Duchess of Malfi</a>" and the first major revival of "<a href="Lady%20Windermere%27s%20Fan">Lady Windermere's Fan</a>" (1945). These productions attracted much praise, but at this point in his career Gielgud was somewhat overshadowed by his old colleagues. Olivier was celebrated for his recent film of "<a href="Henry%20V%20%281944%20film%29">Henry V</a>", and with Richardson (and <a href="John%20Burrell%20%28theatre%20director%29">John Burrell</a> in Gielgud's stead) was making the Old Vic "the most famous theatre in the Anglo-Saxon world" according to the critic <a href="Harold%20Hobson">Harold Hobson</a>.

In late 1945 and early 1946 Gielgud toured for <a href="Entertainments%20National%20Service%20Association">ENSA</a> in the Middle and Far East with "Hamlet" and Coward's "<a href="Blithe%20Spirit%20%28play%29">Blithe Spirit</a>". During this tour he played Hamlet on stage for the last time. He was <a href="Rodion%20Raskolnikov">Raskolnikoff</a> in a stage version of "<a href="Crime%20and%20Punishment">Crime and Punishment</a>", in the West End in 1946 and on Broadway the following year. Agate thought it the best thing Gielgud had done so far, other than Hamlet. Between these two engagements Gielgud toured North America in "The Importance of Being Earnest" and "Love for Love". Edith Evans was tired of the role of Lady Bracknell, and refused to join him; <a href="Margaret%20Rutherford">Margaret Rutherford</a> played the part to great acclaim. Gielgud was in demand as a director, with six productions in 1948–49. They included "<a href="The%20Heiress%20%281947%20play%29">The Heiress</a>" in 1949, when he was brought in at the last moment to direct Richardson and Ashcroft, saving what seemed a doomed production; it ran for 644 performances. His last big hit of the 1940s was as Thomas Mendip in "<a href="The%20Lady%27s%20Not%20for%20Burning">The Lady's Not for Burning</a>", which he also directed. The London cast included the young <a href="Claire%20Bloom">Claire Bloom</a> and <a href="Richard%20Burton">Richard Burton</a>, who went with Gielgud when he took the piece to the US the following year.

At the <a href="Royal%20Shakespeare%20Theatre">Shakespeare Memorial Theatre</a>, <a href="Stratford-upon-Avon">Stratford-upon-Avon</a>, Gielgud did much to reclaim his position as a leading Shakespearean. His cold, unsympathetic Angelo in <a href="Peter%20Brook">Peter Brook</a>'s production of "<a href="Measure%20for%20Measure">Measure for Measure</a>" (1950) showed the public a new, naturalistic manner in his playing. He followed this with three other Shakespeare productions with Brook, which were well received. His own attempt at direction in Stratford, for Richardson's "Macbeth" in 1952, was much less successful, with poor notices for the star and worse ones for the director.

In 1953 Gielgud made his first Hollywood film, the sole classical actor in <a href="Joseph%20L.%20Mankiewicz">Joseph L. Mankiewicz</a>'s "<a href="Julius%20Caesar%20%281953%20film%29">Julius Caesar</a>", playing <a href="Gaius%20Cassius%20Longinus">Cassius</a>. <a href="Marlon%20Brando">Marlon Brando</a> (Mark Antony) was in awe of him, and <a href="James%20Mason">James Mason</a> (Brutus) was disheartened at Gielgud's seemingly effortless skill. Gielgud, for his part, felt he learned much about film technique from Mason. Gielgud enjoyed his four-month stay in California, not least, as Morley comments, for the relaxed attitude there to homosexuality.
Returning to London later in 1953 Gielgud took over management of the Lyric, Hammersmith, for a classical season of "Richard II", Congreve's "<a href="The%20Way%20of%20the%20World">The Way of the World</a>", and <a href="Thomas%20Otway">Thomas Otway</a>'s "<a href="Venice%20Preserv%27d">Venice Preserv'd</a>", directing the first, acting in the last, and doing both in the second. Feeling he was too old for Richard, he cast the young <a href="Paul%20Scofield">Paul Scofield</a>; both the actor and the production were a critical and commercial success. During the season Gielgud was <a href="knight%20bachelor">knighted</a> in the <a href="1953%20Coronation%20Honours">1953 Coronation Honours</a>.

On the evening of 20 October 1953, Gielgud, usually highly discreet about casual sex, was arrested in <a href="Chelsea%2C%20London">Chelsea</a> for <a href="Cruising%20for%20sex">cruising</a> in a public lavatory. Until the 1960s sexual activity of any kind between men was illegal in Britain. The <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a> of the day, <a href="David%20Maxwell%20Fyfe">David Maxwell Fyfe</a>, was fervently homophobic, urging the police to arrest anyone who contravened the Victorian laws against homosexuality. Gielgud was fined; when the press reported the story, he thought his disgrace would end his career. When the news broke he was in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> on the pre-London tour of a new play, "A Day by the Sea". According to the biographer <a href="Richard%20Huggett%20%28playwright%29">Richard Huggett</a>, Gielgud was so paralysed by nerves that the prospect of going onstage as usual seemed impossible, but his fellow players, led by <a href="Sybil%20Thorndike">Sybil Thorndike</a>, encouraged him:
His career was safe, but the episode briefly affected Gielgud's health; he suffered a <a href="mental%20breakdown">nervous breakdown</a> some months afterwards. He never spoke publicly about the incident, and it was quickly sidelined by the press and politely ignored by writers during his lifetime. Privately he made donations to <a href="LGBT%20rights%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">gay campaign groups</a>, but did not endorse them in public. In his later years he said to the actor <a href="Simon%20Callow">Simon Callow</a>, "I do admire people like you and <a href="Ian%20McKellen">Ian McKellen</a> for coming out, but I can't be doing with that myself."

Between December 1953 and June 1955 Gielgud concentrated on directing and did not appear on stage. His productions ranged from a revival of "Charley's Aunt" with <a href="John%20Mills">John Mills</a> to "The Cherry Orchard" with Ffrangcon-Davies, and "Twelfth Night" with Olivier. His return to the stage was in a production of "King Lear", which was badly hampered by costumes and scenery by <a href="Isamu%20Noguchi">Isamu Noguchi</a> that the critics found ludicrous. A revival of "Much Ado About Nothing" with Ashcroft in 1955 was much better received; in "The Manchester Guardian", <a href="Philip%20Hope-Wallace">Philip Hope-Wallace</a> called it "Shakespearean comedy for once perfectly realised". In 1955 Gielgud made his second appearance in a film of Shakespeare, portraying <a href="George%20Plantagenet%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Clarence">Clarence</a> in Olivier's "<a href="Richard%20III%20%281955%20film%29">Richard III</a>".

In the second half of the 1950s Gielgud's career was in the doldrums as far as new plays were concerned. British theatre was moving away from the West End glamour of Beaumont's productions to more "" works. Olivier had a great success in <a href="John%20Osborne">John Osborne</a>'s "<a href="The%20Entertainer%20%28play%29">The Entertainer</a>" in 1957, but Gielgud was not in tune with the new wave of writers. He remained in demand as a Shakespearean, but there were few new plays suitable for him. He directed and played the lead in Coward's "<a href="Nude%20with%20Violin">Nude with Violin</a>" in 1956, which was dismissed by the critics as old-fashioned, though it ran for more than a year. He made two film appearances, playing a cameo comedy scene with Coward as a prospective manservant in <a href="Michael%20Anderson%20%28director%29">Michael Anderson</a>'s "<a href="Around%20the%20World%20in%2080%20Days%20%281956%20film%29">Around the World in 80 Days</a>" (1956), and as the father of <a href="Elizabeth%20Barrett%20Browning">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a> in <a href="Sidney%20Franklin%20%28director%29">Sidney Franklin's</a> 1957 remake of "<a href="The%20Barretts%20of%20Wimpole%20Street%20%281957%20film%29">The Barretts of Wimpole Street</a>". He did not consider his performance as the tyrannical father convincing, and confessed that he undertook it only for the large fee ("it will set me up for a couple of years") and to keep him before the public in America, where he had not performed for over four years.
During 1957 Gielgud directed <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a>'s "<a href="Les%20Troyens">The Trojans</a>" at <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Covent Garden</a> and played Prospero at <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Drury Lane</a>, but the production central to his career over the late 1950s and into the 1960s was his one-man show "The Ages of Man". He first appeared in this in 1956 and revived it every year until 1967. It was an anthology of Shakespearean speeches and <a href="Shakespeare%27s%20sonnets">sonnets</a>, compiled by <a href="Dadie%20Rylands">George Rylands</a>, in which, wearing modern evening clothes on a plain stage, Gielgud recited the verses, with his own linking commentary. He performed it all over Britain, mainland Europe, Australasia and the US, including a performance at the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> in 1965. He found there were advantages to performing solo: "You've no idea how much easier it is without a Juliet. When there's a beautiful girl above you on a balcony, or lying on a tomb with candles round her, naturally the audience look at her the whole time, and Romeo has to pull out all the stops to get any attention." His performance on Broadway won him a <a href="Special%20Tony%20Award">Special Tony Award</a> in <a href="13th%20Tony%20Awards">1959</a>, and an audio recording in 1979 received a <a href="22nd%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">Grammy Award</a> for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Spoken%20Word%20Album">Best Spoken Word Album</a>. He made many other recordings, both before and after this, including ten Shakespeare plays.

Gielgud continued to try, without much success, to find new plays that suited him as an actor, but his direction of <a href="Peter%20Shaffer">Peter Shaffer</a>'s first play, "<a href="Five%20Finger%20Exercise">Five Finger Exercise</a>" (1958), received acclaim. While in the US for the Shaffer play, Gielgud revived "Much Ado About Nothing", this time with <a href="Margaret%20Leighton">Margaret Leighton</a> as his Beatrice. Most of the New York critics praised the production, and they all praised the co-stars. He gave his first performances on television during 1959, in Rattigan's "<a href="The%20Browning%20Version%20%28play%29">The Browning Version</a>" for <a href="CBS">CBS</a> and <a href="N.%20C.%20Hunter">N C Hunter</a>'s "A Day by the Sea" for <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a>. He appeared in more than fifty more plays on television over the next four decades.

During the early 1960s Gielgud had more successes as a director than as an actor. He directed the first London performance of <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Britten</a>'s opera "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream%20%28opera%29">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>" (1961) at Covent Garden and <a href="Hugh%20Wheeler">Hugh Wheeler</a>'s "<a href="Big%20Fish%2C%20Little%20Fish%20%28play%29">Big Fish, Little Fish</a>" on Broadway, the latter winning him a Tony for <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Direction%20of%20a%20Play">Best Direction of a Play</a> in <a href="15th%20Tony%20Awards">1961</a>. His performance as Othello at Stratford in the same year was less successful; <a href="Franco%20Zeffirelli">Franco Zeffirelli</a>'s production was thought ponderous and Gielgud "singularly unvehement". As Gaev in "The Cherry Orchard" to the Ranevskaya of Ashcroft he had the best of the notices; his co-star and the production received mixed reviews. The following year Gielgud directed Richardson in "The School for Scandal", first at the Haymarket and then on a North American tour, which he joined as, in his words, "the oldest Joseph Surface in the business".

In 1962 Gielgud met Martin Hensler (1932–99), an interior designer exiled from Hungary. He was temperamental, and Gielgud's friends often found him difficult, but the two became a long-term couple and lived together until Hensler's death. Under his influence Gielgud moved his main residence from central London to <a href="Wotton%20Underwood">Wotton Underwood</a> in Buckinghamshire.

Gielgud received an <a href="Academy%20Awards">Oscar</a> nomination for his performance as King <a href="Louis%20VII%20of%20France">Louis VII of France</a> in "<a href="Becket%20%281964%20film%29">Becket</a>" (1964), with Richard Burton in the title role. Morley comments, "A minor but flashy role, this had considerable and long-lasting importance; his unrivalled theatrical dignity could greatly enhance a film." In 1964 Gielgud directed Burton in "Hamlet" on Broadway. Burton's performance received reviews ranging from polite to hostile, but the production was a box-office success, and a film was made of it. Gielgud finally began to take the cinema seriously, for financial and sometimes artistic reasons. He told his agent to accept any reasonable film offers. His films of the mid-1960s were in <a href="Tony%20Richardson">Tony Richardson</a>'s "<a href="The%20Loved%20One%20%28film%29">The Loved One</a>" (1965), which Croall termed a disaster despite later acclaim, and <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a>'s <a href="Falstaff">Falstaff</a> film, "<a href="Chimes%20at%20Midnight">Chimes at Midnight</a>" (1966), which was unsuccessful at the time but has since been recognised as "one of the best, albeit most eccentric, of all Shakespearean movies", according to Morley.

Much of Gielgud's theatre work in the later 1960s was as a director: Chekhov's "<a href="Ivanov%20%28play%29">Ivanov</a>" at the <a href="Phoenix%20Theatre%20%28London%29">Phoenix</a> in London and the <a href="Shubert%20Theatre%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Shubert</a> in New York, <a href="Peter%20Ustinov">Peter Ustinov</a>'s "Half Way Up the Tree" at the Queen's and <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>'s "<a href="Don%20Giovanni">Don Giovanni</a>" at the <a href="English%20National%20Opera">Coliseum</a>. One potentially outstanding acting role, Ibsen's Bishop Nicholas, fell through in 1967 when Olivier, with whom he was to co-star at the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">National Theatre</a> in "<a href="The%20Pretenders%20%28play%29">The Pretenders</a>", was ill. Gielgud played Orgon in "<a href="Tartuffe">Tartuffe</a>" and the title role in <a href="Seneca%20the%20Younger">Seneca</a>'s "<a href="Oedipus%20%28Seneca%29">Oedipus</a>" during the National's 1967–68 season, but according to Croall neither production was satisfactory. After this, Gielgud at last found a modern role that suited him and which he played to acclaim: the Headmaster in <a href="Alan%20Bennett">Alan Bennett</a>'s first play, "<a href="Forty%20Years%20On%20%28play%29">Forty Years On</a>" (1968). The notices for both play and star were excellent. In "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" John Barber wrote, "Gielgud dominates all with an unexpected caricature of a mincing pedant, his noble features blurred so as to mimic a fussed and fatuous egghead. From the great mandarin of the theatre, a delicious comic creation."

Having finally embraced film-making, Gielgud appeared in six films in 1967–69. His most substantial role was <a href="FitzRoy%20Somerset%2C%201st%20Baron%20Raglan">Lord Raglan</a> in Tony Richardson's "<a href="The%20Charge%20of%20the%20Light%20Brigade%20%281968%20film%29">The Charge of the Light Brigade</a>". His other roles, in films including Michael Anderson's "<a href="The%20Shoes%20of%20the%20Fisherman">The Shoes of the Fisherman</a>" (1968) as a fictional pope and <a href="Richard%20Attenborough">Richard Attenborough</a>'s "<a href="Oh%21%20What%20a%20Lovely%20War">Oh! What a Lovely War</a>" (1969) as <a href="Count%20Leopold%20Berchtold">Count Leopold Berchtold</a>, were cameo appearances in character roles.

In 1970 Gielgud played another modern role in which he had great success; he joined Ralph Richardson at the <a href="Royal%20Court%20Theatre">Royal Court</a> in Chelsea in <a href="David%20Storey">David Storey</a>'s "<a href="Home%20%28play%29">Home</a>". The play is set in the gardens of a nursing home for mental patients, though this is not clear at first. The two elderly men converse in a desultory way, are joined and briefly enlivened by two more extrovert female patients, are slightly scared by another male patient, and are then left together, conversing even more emptily. The "<a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>" critic, Jeremy Kingston, wrote:

The play transferred to the West End and then to Broadway. In "The New York Times" <a href="Clive%20Barnes">Clive Barnes</a> wrote, "The two men, bleakly examining the little nothingness of their lives, are John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson giving two of the greatest performances of two careers that have been among the glories of the English-speaking theater." The original cast recorded the play for television in 1972.
In the first half of the decade Gielgud made seven films and six television dramas. Morley describes his choice as indiscriminate, but singles out for praise his performances in 1974 as the Old Cardinal in <a href="Joseph%20Losey">Joseph Losey</a>'s "<a href="Galileo%20%281975%20film%29">Galileo</a>" and the manservant Beddoes in <a href="Sidney%20Lumet">Sidney Lumet</a>'s "<a href="Murder%20on%20the%20Orient%20Express%20%281974%20film%29">Murder on the Orient Express</a>". In a 1971 BBC presentation of <a href="James%20Elroy%20Flecker">James Elroy Flecker</a>'s "Hassan", Gielgud played the Caliph to Richardson's Hassan. The critic of "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20London%20News">The Illustrated London News</a>" said that viewers would "shiver at a towering performance by Gielgud, as a Caliph with all the purring beauty and ruthlessness of a great golden leopard". In the theatre Gielgud directed Coward's "<a href="Private%20Lives">Private Lives</a>" and <a href="W.%20Somerset%20Maugham">Somerset Maugham</a>'s "<a href="The%20Constant%20Wife">The Constant Wife</a>" (both 1973, London and 1974, New York). His final production as a director was <a href="Arthur%20Wing%20Pinero">Pinero</a>'s "<a href="The%20Gay%20Lord%20Quex%20%28play%29">The Gay Lord Quex</a>" (1975).

Gielgud continued his long stage association with Richardson in <a href="Harold%20Pinter">Harold Pinter</a>'s "<a href="No%20Man%27s%20Land%20%28play%29">No Man's Land</a>" (1975), directed by Hall at the National. Richardson played Hirst, a prosperous but isolated and vulnerable author, and Gielgud was Spooner, a down-at-heel sponger and opportunist. Hall found the play "extremely funny and also extremely bleak". The production was a critical and box-office success and, over a period of three years, played at the Old Vic, in the West End, at the <a href="Lyttelton%20Theatre">Lyttelton Theatre</a> in the new National Theatre complex, on Broadway and on television. In <a href="Julian%20Mitchell">Julian Mitchell</a>'s "Half-Life" (1977) at the National, Gielgud was warmly praised by reviewers; he reprised the role at the <a href="Duke%20of%20York%27s%20Theatre">Duke of York's Theatre</a> in the West End in 1978 and on tour the following year.

In the latter part of the decade Gielgud worked more for cinema and television than on stage. His film work included what Morley calls "his most embarrassing professional appearance", in "<a href="Caligula%20%28film%29">Caligula</a>" (1979), <a href="Gore%20Vidal">Gore Vidal</a>'s story of Ancient Rome, spiced with pornographic scenes. In Gielgud's ten other films from this period, his most substantial role was Clive Langham in <a href="Alain%20Resnais">Alain Resnais</a>' "<a href="Providence%20%281977%20film%29">Providence</a>" (1977). Gielgud thought it "by far the most exciting film I have ever made". He won a <a href="New%20York%20Film%20Critics%20Circle">New York Film Critics Circle</a> award for his performance as a dying author, "drunk half the time ... throwing bottles about, and roaring a lot of very coarse dialogue". His other film parts included the Head Master of Eton in <a href="Jack%20Gold">Jack Gold</a>'s "<a href="Aces%20High%20%28film%29">Aces High</a>" (1976) and Tomlinson in <a href="Otto%20Preminger">Otto Preminger</a>'s "<a href="The%20Human%20Factor%20%281979%20film%29">The Human Factor</a>" (1979). For television his roles included Lord Henry Wotton in "<a href="The%20Picture%20of%20Dorian%20Gray%20%281976%20TV%29">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a>" (1976), <a href="John%20of%20Gaunt">John of Gaunt</a> in "Richard II" (1978) and Chorus in "Romeo and Juliet" (1978).

In the 1980s Gielgud appeared in more than twenty films. Morley singles out as noteworthy "<a href="The%20Elephant%20Man%20%28film%29">The Elephant Man</a>" (1980), as the chairman of the <a href="Royal%20London%20Hospital">Royal London Hospital</a>, "<a href="Chariots%20of%20Fire">Chariots of Fire</a>" (1981), as the Master of <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, "<a href="Gandhi%20%28film%29">Gandhi</a>" (1982), as <a href="Edward%20Wood%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Halifax">Lord Irwin</a> (the latter two winning Academy Awards as Best Picture), "<a href="The%20Shooting%20Party">The Shooting Party</a>" (1984) and "<a href="Plenty%20%28film%29">Plenty</a>" (1985), directed by <a href="David%20Lynch">David Lynch</a>, <a href="Hugh%20Hudson">Hugh Hudson</a>, Richard Attenborough, <a href="Alan%20Bridges">Alan Bridges</a> and <a href="Fred%20Schepisi">Fred Schepisi</a> respectively. <a href="Tony%20Palmer">Tony Palmer</a>'s "<a href="Wagner%20%28film%29">Wagner</a>" (1983) was the only film in which Gielgud, Richardson, and Olivier played scenes together. Gielgud made cameo appearances in films of little merit, lending distinction while not damaging his own reputation. He told an interviewer, "They pay me very well for two or three days' work a month, so why not? It's nice at my age to be able to travel all over the world at other people's expense."

Gielgud's most successful film performance of the decade was <a href="Steve%20Gordon%20%28director%29">Steve Gordon</a>'s comedy "<a href="Arthur%20%281981%20film%29">Arthur</a>" (1981), which starred <a href="Dudley%20Moore">Dudley Moore</a> as a self-indulgent playboy. Gielgud played Hobson, Moore's butler. He turned the part down twice before finally accepting it, nervous, after the "Caligula" débâcle, of the strong language used by the acerbic Hobson. He won an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor">Oscar as Best Supporting Actor</a> and other awards for the performance. He placed little value on awards, and avoided presentation ceremonies whenever he could: "I really detest all the mutual congratulation baloney and the invidious comparisons which they evoke."

For television Gielgud played nineteen roles during the 1980s; they included Edward Ryder in an <a href="Brideshead%20Revisited%20%28TV%20serial%29">eleven-part adaptation</a> of <a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Waugh</a>'s "<a href="Brideshead%20Revisited">Brideshead Revisited</a>" (1982); "The Times" said that he gave the role "a desolate and calculated malice which carries almost singlehandedly [the] first two episodes". At the end of the decade he played a rakish journalist, Haverford Downs, in <a href="John%20Mortimer">John Mortimer</a>'s "<a href="Summer%27s%20Lease">Summer's Lease</a>", for which he won an <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Lead%20Actor%20in%20a%20Limited%20Series%20or%20Movie">Emmy Award</a> after its 1991 American broadcast.

Gielgud's final West End play was <a href="Hugh%20Whitemore">Hugh Whitemore</a>'s "<a href="The%20Best%20of%20Friends%20%28play%29">The Best of Friends</a>" (1988). He played <a href="Sydney%20Cockerell">Sir Sydney Cockerell</a>, director of the <a href="Fitzwilliam%20Museum">Fitzwilliam Museum</a>, in a representation of a friendship between Cockerell, <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">Bernard Shaw</a> and <a href="Laurentia%20McLachlan">Laurentia McLachlan</a>, a <a href="Order%20of%20Saint%20Benedict">Benedictine</a> nun. Gielgud had some trouble learning his lines; at one performance he almost forgot them, momentarily distracted by seeing in a 1938 copy of "The Times", read by his character, a review of his own portrayal of Vershinin in "Three Sisters" fifty years earlier.

In 1990 Gielgud appeared in the <a href="James%20Scott%20%28artist%29">James Scott</a>-directed "<a href="Strike%20It%20Rich%20%281990%20film%29">Strike It Rich</a>", an adaptation of a <a href="Graham%20Greene">Graham Greene</a> novel co-starring <a href="Molly%20Ringwald">Molly Ringwald</a> and <a href="Robert%20Lindsay%20%28actor%29">Robert Lindsay</a>. That same year he made his last film appearance in a leading role, playing Prospero in "<a href="Prospero%27s%20Books">Prospero's Books</a>", <a href="Peter%20Greenaway">Peter Greenaway</a>'s adaptation of "The Tempest". Reviews for the film were mixed, but Gielgud's performance in one of his signature roles was much praised. He continued to work on radio, as he had done throughout his career; Croall lists more than fifty BBC radio productions of plays starring Gielgud between 1929 and 1994. To mark his ninetieth birthday he played Lear for the last time; for the BBC <a href="Kenneth%20Branagh">Kenneth Branagh</a> gathered a cast that included <a href="Judi%20Dench">Judi Dench</a>, <a href="Eileen%20Atkins">Eileen Atkins</a> and <a href="Emma%20Thompson">Emma Thompson</a> as Lear's daughters, with actors such as <a href="Bob%20Hoskins">Bob Hoskins</a>, <a href="Derek%20Jacobi">Derek Jacobi</a> and <a href="Simon%20Russell%20Beale">Simon Russell Beale</a> in supporting roles. He continued to appear on television until 1994; his last role in the medium was in a BBC production that year of <a href="J.%20B.%20Priestley">J. B. Priestley</a>'s rarely-revived "<a href="Summer%20Day%27s%20Dream">Summer Day's Dream</a>". Subsequently, he made further cameo appearances in films including Branagh's "<a href="Hamlet%20%281996%20film%29">Hamlet</a>" (as King Priam, 1996), "<a href="Dragonheart">Dragonheart</a>" (as the voice of <a href="King%20Arthur">King Arthur</a>, 1996), and "<a href="Shine%20%28film%29">Shine</a>" (as Cecil Parkes, 1996). His last feature film appearance was as <a href="Pope%20Pius%20V">Pope Pius V</a> in <a href="Shekhar%20Kapur">Shekhar Kapur</a>'s "<a href="Elizabeth%20%28film%29">Elizabeth</a>" (1999). In 2000 he had a non-speaking role alongside Pinter in a film of Beckett's short play "<a href="Catastrophe%20%28play%29">Catastrophe</a>" directed by <a href="David%20Mamet">David Mamet</a>.

Gielgud's partner, Martin Hensler, died in 1999. After this, Gielgud went into a physical and psychological decline; he died at home in May the following year, at the age of 96. At his request there was no memorial service, and his funeral at Wotton parish church was private, for family and close friends. His ashes were scattered in the rose garden of his home, where those of Martin Hensler had been sprinkled after his death the previous year.

Gielgud's state honours were <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">Knight Bachelor</a> (1953), <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a> (France, 1960), <a href="Companion%20of%20Honour">Companion of Honour</a> (1977), and <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">Order of Merit</a> (UK, 1996). He was awarded honorary degrees by <a href="University%20of%20St%20Andrews">St Andrews</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a> and <a href="Brandeis%20University">Brandeis</a> universities.

From 1977 to 1989 Gielgud was president of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art—a symbolic position—and was the academy's first honorary fellow (1989). In 1996 the Globe Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue was renamed the <a href="Gielgud%20Theatre">Gielgud Theatre</a>. He had not acted on stage for eight years, and felt out of touch with the West End: he commented on the renaming of the theatre, "At last there is a name in lights on the Avenue which I actually recognise, even if it is my own."

Gielgud was uninterested in religion or politics. As a boy he had been fascinated by the rituals at Westminster Abbey, but his brief attraction to religion quickly faded, and as an adult he was a non-believer. His indifference to politics was illustrated at a formal dinner not long after the Second World War when he asked a fellow guest, "Whereabouts are you living now?", unaware that, as he was talking to <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a>, the answer was "<a href="10%20Downing%20Street">10 Downing Street</a>". In his "<a href="Who%27s%20Who%20%28UK%29">Who's Who</a>" entry Gielgud listed his hobbies as music and painting, but his concentration on his work, which Emlyn Williams called fanatical, left little scope for leisure activities. His dedication to his art was not solemn. The critic <a href="Nicholas%20de%20Jongh">Nicholas de Jongh</a> wrote that Gielgud's personality was "such infinite, mischievous fun", and Coward's biographer Cole Lesley recalled the pleasure of Gielgud's company, "the words tumbling out of his mouth in an avalanche, frequently having to wipe away his own tears of laughter at the funniness of the disasters he recounted, disasters always against himself".

Together with Richardson and Olivier, Gielgud was internationally recognised as one of the "great trinity of theatrical knights" who dominated the British stage for more than fifty years during the middle and later decades of the 20th century. The critic <a href="Michael%20Coveney">Michael Coveney</a> wrote, for Gielgud's ninety-fifth birthday:
In an obituary in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" Alan Strachan, having discussed Gielgud's work for cinema, radio and television, concluded that "any consideration of Gielgud's rich and often astonishing career must return to the stage; as he wrote at the close of "An Actor and his Time" (1979), he saw the theatre as 'more than an occupation or a profession; for me it has been a life'."

South Pacific (musical)

South Pacific is a <a href="musical%20theatre">musical</a> composed by <a href="Richard%20Rodgers">Richard Rodgers</a>, with lyrics by <a href="Oscar%20Hammerstein%20II">Oscar Hammerstein II</a> and <a href="Book%20%28musical%20theatre%29">book</a> by Hammerstein and <a href="Joshua%20Logan">Joshua Logan</a>. The work premiered in 1949 on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> and was an immediate hit, running for 1,925 performances. The plot is based on <a href="James%20A.%20Michener">James A. Michener</a>'s <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Fiction">Pulitzer Prize-winning</a> 1947 book "<a href="Tales%20of%20the%20South%20Pacific">Tales of the South Pacific</a>" and combines elements of several of those stories. <a href="Rodgers%20and%20Hammerstein">Rodgers and Hammerstein</a> believed they could write a musical based on Michener's work that would be financially successful and, at the same time, send a strong progressive message on racism.

The plot centers on an American nurse stationed on a South Pacific island during World War II, who falls in love with a middle-aged expatriate French plantation owner but struggles to accept his mixed-race children. A secondary romance, between a U.S. lieutenant and a young <a href="Tonkin">Tonkin</a>ese woman, explores his fears of the social consequences should he marry his Asian sweetheart. The issue of racial prejudice is candidly explored throughout the musical, most controversially in the lieutenant's song, "<a href="You%27ve%20Got%20to%20Be%20Carefully%20Taught">You've Got to Be Carefully Taught</a>". Supporting characters, including a comic <a href="petty%20officer%23United%20States">petty officer</a> and the Tonkinese girl's mother, help to tie the stories together. Because he lacked military knowledge, Hammerstein had difficulty writing that part of the script; the director of the original production, Logan, assisted him and received credit as co-writer of the book.

The original Broadway production enjoyed immense critical and box-office success, became <a href="List%20of%20the%20longest-running%20Broadway%20shows">the second-longest running Broadway musical</a> to that point (behind Rodgers and Hammerstein's earlier "<a href="Oklahoma%21">Oklahoma!</a>" (1943)), and has remained popular ever since. After they signed <a href="Ezio%20Pinza">Ezio Pinza</a> and <a href="Mary%20Martin">Mary Martin</a> as the leads, Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote several of the songs with the particular talents of their stars in mind. The piece won the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Drama">Pulitzer Prize for Drama</a> in 1950. Especially in the Southern U.S., its racial theme provoked controversy, for which its authors were unapologetic. Several of its songs, including "<a href="Bali%20Ha%27i">Bali Ha'i</a>", "<a href="I%27m%20Gonna%20Wash%20That%20Man%20Right%20Outa%20My%20Hair">I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair</a>", "<a href="Some%20Enchanted%20Evening">Some Enchanted Evening</a>", "<a href="There%20Is%20Nothing%20Like%20a%20Dame">There Is Nothing Like a Dame</a>", "<a href="Happy%20Talk%20%28song%29">Happy Talk</a>", "<a href="Younger%20Than%20Springtime">Younger Than Springtime</a>", and "<a href="I%27m%20in%20Love%20with%20a%20Wonderful%20Guy">I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy</a>", have become popular standards.

The production won ten <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a>s, including Best Musical, Best Score, and Best Libretto, and it is the only musical production to win Tony Awards in all four acting categories. Its original cast album was the bestselling record of the 1940s, and other recordings of the show have also been popular. The show has enjoyed many successful revivals and tours, spawning a <a href="South%20Pacific%20%281958%20film%29">1958 film</a> and television adaptations. The 2008 Broadway revival, a critical success, ran for 996 performances and won seven Tonys, including Best Musical Revival.

Although book editor and university instructor <a href="James%20Michener">James Michener</a> could have avoided military service in World War II as a birthright <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a>, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy in October 1942. He was not sent to <a href="Asiatic-Pacific%20Theater">the South Pacific theater</a> until April 1944, when he was assigned to write a history of the Navy in the Pacific and was allowed to travel widely. He survived a plane crash in <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a>; the near-death experience motivated him to write fiction, and he began listening to the stories told by soldiers. One journey took him to the <a href="Treasury%20Islands">Treasury Islands</a>, where he discovered an unpleasant village, called Bali-ha'i, populated by "scrawny residents and only one pig". Struck by the name, Michener wrote it down and soon began to record, on a battered typewriter, his version of the tales. On a plantation on the island of <a href="Espiritu%20Santo">Espiritu Santo</a>, he met a woman named Bloody Mary; she was small, almost toothless, her face stained with red <a href="betel%20nut">betel juice</a>. Punctuated with profanity learned from <a href="G.I.%20%28military%29">GIs</a>, she complained endlessly to Michener about the French colonial government, which refused to allow her and other <a href="Tonkin">Tonkin</a>ese to return to their native Vietnam, lest the plantations be depopulated. She told him also of her plans to oppose colonialism in <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a>. These stories, collected into "<a href="Tales%20of%20the%20South%20Pacific">Tales of the South Pacific</a>", won Michener the <a href="1948%20Pulitzer%20Prize">1948 Pulitzer Prize</a> for fiction.

"Tales of the South Pacific" comprises nineteen stories. Each stands independently but revolves around the preparation for an American military operation to dislodge the Japanese from a nearby island. This operation, dubbed "Alligator", occurs in the penultimate story, "The Landing at Kuralei". Many of the characters die in that battle, and the last story is titled "The Cemetery at Huga Point". The stories are thematically linked in pairs: the first and final stories are reflective, the second and eighteenth involve battle, the third and seventeenth involve preparation for battle, and so on. The tenth story, at the center, however, is not paired with any other. This story, "Fo' Dolla' ", was one of only four of his many works that Michener later admitted to holding in high regard. It was the one that attracted <a href="Rodgers%20and%20Hammerstein">Rodgers and Hammerstein</a>'s attention for its potential to be converted into a stage work.

"Fo' Dolla' ", set in part on the island of Bali-ha'i, focuses on the romance between a young Tonkinese woman, Liat, and one of the Americans, Marine Lieutenant Joe Cable, a <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton</a> graduate and scion of a wealthy <a href="Philadelphia%20Main%20Line">Main Line</a> family. Pressed to marry Liat by her mother, Bloody Mary, Cable reluctantly declines, realizing that the Asian girl would never be accepted by his family or Philadelphia society. He leaves for battle (where he will die) as Bloody Mary proceeds with her backup plan, to affiance Liat to a wealthy French planter on the islands. Cable struggles, during the story, with his own racism: he is able to overcome it sufficiently to love Liat, but not enough to take her home.

Another source of the musical is the eighth story, "Our Heroine", which is thematically paired with the 12th, "A Boar's Tooth", as both involve American encounters with local cultures. "Our Heroine" tells of the romance between Navy nurse Nellie Forbush, from rural Arkansas, and a wealthy, sophisticated planter, Frenchman Emile De Becque. After falling in love with Emile, Nellie (who is introduced briefly in story #4, "An Officer and a Gentleman") learns that Emile has eight daughters, out of wedlock, with several local women. Michener tells us that "any person ... who was not white or yellow was a nigger" to Nellie, and while she is willing to accept two of the children (of French-Asian descent) who remain in Emile's household, she is taken aback by the other two girls who live there, evidence that the planter had cohabited with a darker Polynesian woman. To her great relief, she learns that this woman is dead, but Nellie endangers her relationship with Emile when she is initially unable to accept Emile's "nigger children." Nellie overcomes her feelings and returns to spend her life with her plantation owner.

Additional elements of "South Pacific" had their genesis in others of Michener's 19 tales. One introduces the character of Bloody Mary; another tells of a British spy hidden on the Japanese-controlled island who relays information about Japanese movements to <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied forces</a> by radio. Michener based the spy, dubbed "the Remittance Man", on Captain <a href="Martin%20Clemens">Martin Clemens</a>, a Scot, who unlike his fictional counterpart, survived the war. The stories also tell of the seemingly endless waiting that precedes battle, and the efforts of the Americans to repel boredom, which would inspire the song "<a href="There%20Is%20Nothing%20Like%20a%20Dame">There Is Nothing Like a Dame</a>". Several of the stories involve the <a href="Seabee">Seabee</a>, Luther Billis, who in the musical would be used both for comic relief and to tie together episodes involving otherwise unconnected characters. A 2001 article in "Islands Magazine" states that Michener renamed <a href="Ambae%20Island">Aoba Island</a> Bali-ha'i. The author interviewed the proprietor of a resort on <a href="Espiritu%20Santo">Espiritu Santo</a>, who claimed that Emile was modeled on his father and that the "real Bloody Mary" lived on Espiritu Santo for many years after the war and lived to the age of 102.

In the early 1940s, composer <a href="Richard%20Rodgers">Richard Rodgers</a> and lyricist <a href="Oscar%20Hammerstein%20II">Oscar Hammerstein II</a>, each a longtime Broadway veteran, joined forces and began their collaboration by writing two musicals that became massive hits, "<a href="Oklahoma%21">Oklahoma!</a>" (1943) and "<a href="Carousel%20%28musical%29">Carousel</a>" (1945). An innovation for its time in integrating song, dialogue and dance, "Oklahoma!" would serve as "the model for Broadway shows for decades". In 1999, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine named "Carousel" the best musical of the century, writing that Rodgers and Hammerstein "set the standards for the 20th century musical". Their next effort, "<a href="Allegro%20%28musical%29">Allegro</a>" (1947), was a comparative disappointment, running for less than a year, although it turned a small profit. After this, the two were determined to achieve another hit.

According to director <a href="Joshua%20Logan">Joshua Logan</a>, a friend of both theatre men, he and <a href="Leland%20Hayward">Leland Hayward</a> mentioned Michener's best-selling book to Rodgers as a possible basis for the duo's next play, but the composer took no action. Logan recalled that he then pointed it out to Hammerstein, who read Michener's book and spoke to Rodgers; the two agreed to do the project so long as they had majority control, to which Hayward grudgingly agreed. Michener, in his 1992 memoirs, however, wrote that the stories were first pitched as a movie concept to <a href="MGM">MGM</a> by <a href="Kenneth%20MacKenna">Kenneth MacKenna</a>, head of the studio's literary department. MacKenna's half brother was <a href="Jo%20Mielziner">Jo Mielziner</a>, who had designed the sets for "Carousel" and "Allegro". Michener states that Mielziner learned of the work from MacKenna and brought it to the attention of Hammerstein and Rodgers, pledging to create the sets if they took on the project.

Hayward attempted to buy the rights from Michener outright, offering $500; Michener declined. Although playwright <a href="Lynn%20Riggs">Lynn Riggs</a> had received 1.5% of the box office grosses for the right to adapt "<a href="Green%20Grow%20the%20Lilacs">Green Grow the Lilacs</a>" into "Oklahoma!", Michener never regretted accepting one percent of the gross receipts from "South Pacific". As Rodgers and Hammerstein began their work on the adaptation, Michener worked mostly with the lyricist, but Rodgers was concerned about the implications of the setting, fearing that he would have to include ukuleles and guitars, which he disliked. Michener assured him that the only instrument he had ever heard the natives play was an emptied barrel of gasoline, drummed upon with clubs.

Soon after their purchase of the rights, Rodgers and Hammerstein decided not to include a ballet, as in their earlier works, feeling that the realism of the setting would not support one. Concerned that an adaptation too focused on "Fo' Dolla' ", the story of the encounter between Cable and Liat, would be too similar to "<a href="Madama%20Butterfly">Madama Butterfly</a>", Hammerstein spent months studying the other stories and focused his attention on "Our Heroine", the tale of the romance between Nellie and Emile. The team decided to include both romances in the musical play. It was conventional at the time that if one love story in a musical was serious, the other would be more comedic, but in this case both were serious and focused on racial prejudice. They decided to increase the role played by Luther Billis in the stories, merging experiences and elements of several other characters into him. Billis's wheeling and dealing would provide comic relief. They also shortened the title to "South Pacific" – Rodgers related that the producers tired of people making risqué puns on the word "tales".

In early drafts of the musical, Hammerstein gave significant parts to two characters who eventually came to have only minor roles, Bill Harbison and Dinah Culbert. Harbison is one of the major characters in "Tales of the South Pacific"; a model officer at the start, he gradually degenerates to the point where, with battle imminent, he requests his influential father-in-law to procure for him a transfer to a post in the United States. Hammerstein conceived of him as a rival to Emile for Nellie's affections, and gave him a song, "The Bright Young Executive of Today". As redrafts focused the play on the two couples, Harbison became less essential, and he was relegated to a small role as the executive officer to the commander of the island, Captain Brackett. Dinah, a nurse and friend of Nellie, is also a major character in Michener's work, and was seen as a possible love interest for Billis, though any actual romance was limited by Navy regulations forbidding fraternization between officers (all American nurses in World War II were commissioned officers) and enlisted men. "<a href="I%27m%20Gonna%20Wash%20That%20Man%20Right%20Outa%20My%20Hair">I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair</a>" originated as a duet for Dinah and Nellie, with Dinah beginning the song and developing its theme. According to Lovensheimer, Nellie's and Dinah's "friendship became increasingly incidental to the plot as the writing continued. Hammerstein eventually realized that the decision to wash Emile out of her hair had to be Nellie's. Only then did the scene have the dramatic potential for Nellie's emotional transition" as she realizes her love for Emile. In the final version, Dinah retains one solo line in the song.

Joshua Logan, in his memoirs, stated that after months of effort in the first half of 1948, Hammerstein had written only the first scene, an outline, and some lyrics. Hammerstein was having trouble due to lack of knowledge of the military, a matter with which Logan, a veteran of the armed forces, was able to help. The dialogue was written in consultation between the two of them, and eventually Logan asked to be credited for his work. Rodgers and Hammerstein decided that while Logan would receive co-writing credit on the book, he would receive no author's royalties. Logan stated that a contract putting these changes into force was sent over to his lawyer with instructions that unless it was signed within two hours, Logan need not show up for rehearsals as director. Logan signed, although his lawyer did not then tell him about the ultimatum. Through the decades that followed, Logan brought the matter up from time to time, demanding compensation, but when he included his version of the events in his 1976 memoirs, it was disputed by Rodgers (Hammerstein had died in 1960). Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest suggests that Logan was compensated when <a href="South%20Pacific%20%281958%20film%29">"South Pacific" was filmed in 1958</a>, as Logan received a substantial share of the profits as director. According to Michener biographer Stephen J. May, "it is difficult to assess just how much of the final book Josh Logan was responsible for. Some estimates say 30 to 40 percent. But that percentage is not as critical perhaps as his knowledge of military lore and directing for the theatre, without which the creation of "South Pacific" would have collapsed during that summer of 1948."

Rodgers composed the music once he received the lyrics from Hammerstein. A number of stories are told of the speed with which he wrote the music for "South Pacific" 's numbers. "<a href="Happy%20Talk%20%28song%29">Happy Talk</a>" was said to have been composed in about twenty minutes; when Hammerstein, who had sent the lyrics by messenger, called to check whether Rodgers had received them, his partner informed him that he had both lyrics and music. Legend has it he composed "<a href="Bali%20Ha%27i">Bali Ha'i</a>" in ten minutes over coffee in Logan's apartment; what he did create in that time frame was the three-note motif which begins both song and musical. Hammerstein's lyrics for "Bali Ha'i" were inspired by the stage backdrop which designer <a href="Jo%20Mielziner">Jo Mielziner</a> had painted. Feeling that the island of Bali Ha'i did not appear mysterious enough, Mielziner painted some mist near the summit of its volcano. When Hammerstein saw this he immediately thought of the lyric, "my head sticking up from a low-flying cloud" and the rest of the song followed easily from that.

In May 1948, Rodgers received a telephone call from <a href="Edwin%20Lester">Edwin Lester</a> of the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Civic%20Light%20Opera">Los Angeles Civic Light Opera</a>. Lester had signed former <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a> star <a href="Ezio%20Pinza">Ezio Pinza</a> for $25,000 to star in a new show, "Mr. Ambassador". The show had not been written, and it never would be. Lester hoped that Rodgers would take over Pinza's contract. Pinza had become bored as the Met's leading lyric <a href="Bass%20%28voice%20type%29">bass</a>, and having played the great opera houses, sought other worlds to conquer. Rodgers immediately saw Pinza as perfect for the role of Emile. Lester carefully broached the subject to Pinza and his wife/business manager and provided them with a copy of "Tales of the South Pacific". When Pinza read the book, he told Lester, "Sell me right away!" Pinza's contract for "South Pacific" included a clause limiting his singing to 15 minutes per performance. With Pinza's signing, Rodgers and Hammerstein decided to make his the lead male role, subordinating the story of the pair of young lovers. It was unusual on Broadway for the romantic lead to be an older male.
For the role of Nellie, Rodgers sought <a href="Mary%20Martin">Mary Martin</a>, who had nearly been cast to originate the role of Laurey in "Oklahoma!" Martin was playing the title role in the touring company of "<a href="Annie%20Get%20Your%20Gun%20%28musical%29">Annie Get Your Gun</a>". After Hammerstein and Rodgers saw her play in Los Angeles in mid-1948, they asked her to consider the part. Martin was reluctant to sing opposite Pinza's powerful voice; Rodgers assured her he would see to it the two never sang at the same time, a promise he mostly kept. Rodgers and Martin lived near each other in Connecticut, and after her tour Rodgers invited Martin and her husband, Richard Halliday, to his home to hear the three songs for the musical that he had completed, none of them for Nellie. "<a href="Some%20Enchanted%20Evening">Some Enchanted Evening</a>" especially struck Martin, and although disappointed the song was not for her, she agreed to do the part. Although Nellie and Emile were already fully developed characters in Michener's stories, during the creation of "South Pacific", Rodgers, Hammerstein and Logan began to adapt the roles specifically to the talents of Martin and Pinza and to tailor the music for their voices.

Martin influenced several of her songs. While showering one day during rehearsals, she came up with the idea for a scene in which she would shampoo her hair onstage. This gave rise to "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair". Built around a primitive shower that Logan remembered from his time in the military, the song became one of the most talked-about in "South Pacific". To introduce another of Martin's numbers to her, Rodgers called her over to his apartment, where he and Hammerstein played "<a href="I%27m%20in%20Love%20with%20a%20Wonderful%20Guy">I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy</a>" for her. When Martin essayed it for herself, she sang the final 26 words, as intended, with a single breath, and fell off her piano bench. Rodgers gazed down at her, "That's exactly what I want. Never do it differently. We must feel you couldn't squeeze out another sound."

The producers held extensive auditions to fill the other roles. <a href="Myron%20McCormick">Myron McCormick</a> was cast as Billis; according to Logan, no one else was seriously considered. The two roles which gave the most trouble were those of Cable and Bloody Mary. They tried to get Harold Keel for the role of Cable (he had played Curly in the West End production of "Oklahoma!") only to find that he had signed a contract with MGM under the name <a href="Howard%20Keel">Howard Keel</a>. <a href="William%20Tabbert">William Tabbert</a> was eventually cast as Cable, though Logan instructed him to lose . African-American singer <a href="Juanita%20Hall">Juanita Hall</a> was cast as Bloody Mary; Logan recalled that at her audition, she took a squatting pose which proclaimed, "I am Bloody Mary and don't you dare cast anyone else!" <a href="Betta%20St.%20John">Betta St. John</a>, who under the name Betty Striegler had replaced <a href="Bambi%20Linn">Bambi Linn</a> as Louise in "Carousel", took the role of Liat. Logan directed (he and Hayward co-produced with Rodgers and Hammerstein), Mielziner did the stage design, <a href="Trude%20Rittmann">Trude Rittmann</a> and <a href="Robert%20Russell%20Bennett">Robert Russell Bennett</a> prepared the orchestration, and <a href="Elizabeth%20Montgomery%20Wilmot">Elizabeth Montgomery</a> of <a href="Motley%20Theatre%20Design%20Group">Motley Theatre Design Group</a> designed the costumes. <a href="Salvatore%20Dell%27Isola">Salvatore Dell'Isola</a> served as music director.

Rehearsals began at Broadway's <a href="Belasco%20Theatre">Belasco Theatre</a> on February 2, 1949. There was no formal chorus; each of the nurses and <a href="Seabees%20in%20World%20War%20II">Seabees</a> was given a name, and, in the case of the men, $50 to equip themselves with what clothing they felt their characters would wear from the military surplus shops which lined West 42nd Street. <a href="Don%20Fellows">Don Fellows</a>, the first Lt. Buzz Adams, drew on his wartime experience as a Marine to purchase a non-regulation baseball cap and black ankle boots. Martin and Pinza had not known each other, but they soon formed a strong friendship. Of the mood backstage, "everyone agreed: throughout the rehearsals Logan was fiery, demanding, and brilliantly inventive." He implemented lap changes (pioneered by Rodgers and Hammerstein in "Allegro"), whereby the actors coming on next would already be on a darkened part of the stage as one scene concluded. This allowed the musical to continue without interruption by scene changes, making the action almost seamless. He soon had the Seabees pacing back and forth like caged animals during "There Is Nothing Like a Dame", a staging so effective it was never changed during the run of the show. One Logan innovation that Rodgers and Hammerstein reluctantly accepted was to have Cable remove his shirt during the blackout after he and Liat passionately embrace on first meeting, his partial nakedness symbolizing their lovemaking. As originally planned, Martin was supposed to conclude "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy" with an exuberant cartwheel across the stage. This was eliminated after she vaulted into the orchestra pit, knocking out Rittman.

There were no major difficulties during the four weeks of rehearsal in New York; Martin later remembered that the "gypsy run-through" for friends and professional associates on a bare stage was met with some of the most enthusiastic applause she could remember. One of the few people having trouble was Pinza, who had difficulty adjusting to the constant alterations in the show – he was used to the operatic world, where a role rarely changed once learned. Pinza's mispronunciations of English exasperated Logan, and driving to <a href="New%20Haven%2C%20Connecticut">New Haven, Connecticut</a> for the first week of previews, Pinza discussed with his wife the possibility of a return to the Met, where he knew audiences would welcome him. She told him to let "South Pacific" 's attendees decide for themselves. When the tryouts began in New Haven on March 7, the play was an immediate hit; the "<a href="New%20Haven%20Register">New Haven Register</a>" wrote, ""South Pacific" should make history".

Nevertheless, a number of changes were made in New Haven and in the subsequent two weeks of previews in Boston. The show was running long; Logan persuaded his friend, playwright <a href="Emlyn%20Williams">Emlyn Williams</a>, to go over the script and cut extraneous dialogue. There were wide expectations of a hit; producer <a href="Mike%20Todd">Mike Todd</a> came backstage and advised that the show not be taken to New York "because it's too damned good for them". The show moved to Boston, where it was so successful that playwright <a href="George%20S.%20Kaufman">George S. Kaufman</a> joked that people lining up there at the <a href="Shubert%20Theatre%20%28Boston%29">Shubert Theatre</a> "don't actually want anything ... They just want to push money under the doors."
"South Pacific" opened on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> on April 7, 1949, at the <a href="Majestic%20Theatre%20%28Broadway%29">Majestic Theatre</a>. The advance sale was $400,000, and an additional $700,000 in sales was made soon after the opening. The first night audience was packed with important Broadway, business, and arts leaders. The audience repeatedly stopped the show with extended applause, which was sustained at length at the final curtain. Rodgers and Hammerstein had preferred, in the past, not to sponsor an afterparty, but they rented the <a href="St.%20Regis%20Hotel">St. Regis Hotel</a>'s roof and ordered 200 copies of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" in the anticipation of a hit. "Times" critic <a href="Brooks%20Atkinson">Brooks Atkinson</a> gave the show a rave review.

Three days after the opening, Pinza signed a contract with MGM to star in films once his obligation to appear in the show expired. He left the show June 1, 1950, replaced by <a href="Ray%20Middleton%20%28actor%29">Ray Middleton</a>, though Pinza missed a number of shows due to illness before that. Martin recalled that, unused to performing eight shows a week, the former opera star would sing full out early in the week, leaving himself little voice towards the end, and would have his understudy go on. Nevertheless, during the year he was in the show, and although aged 58, he was acclaimed as a sex symbol; <a href="George%20Jean%20Nathan">George Jean Nathan</a> wrote that "Pinza has taken the place of Hot Springs, Saratoga, and hormone injections for all the other old boys".

A national tour began in <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>, Ohio, in April 1950; it ran for five years and starred <a href="Richard%20Eastham">Richard Eastham</a> as Emile, <a href="Janet%20Blair">Janet Blair</a> as Nellie and <a href="Ray%20Walston">Ray Walston</a> as Billis, a role Walston would reprise in London and in the 1958 film. For the 48,000 tickets available in Cleveland, 250,000 requests were submitted, causing the box office to close for three weeks to process them. <a href="Jeanne%20Bal">Jeanne Bal</a> and <a href="Iva%20Withers">Iva Withers</a> were later Nellies on this tour. A scaled-down version toured military bases in Korea in 1951; by the request of Hammerstein and Rodgers, officers and enlisted soldiers sat together to view it.

Martin left the Broadway production in 1951 to appear in the original London <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> production; <a href="Martha%20Wright%20%28actress%29">Martha Wright</a> replaced her. Despite the departure of both original stars, the show remained a huge attraction in New York. <a href="Cloris%20Leachman">Cloris Leachman</a> also played Nellie during the New York run; <a href="George%20Britton%20%28musician%29">George Britton</a> was among the later Emiles. The London production ran from November 1, 1951 for 802 performances at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a>. Logan directed; Martin and <a href="Wilbur%20Evans">Wilbur Evans</a> starred, with Walston as Billis, <a href="Muriel%20Smith%20%28singer%29">Muriel Smith</a> as Bloody Mary and <a href="Ivor%20Emmanuel">Ivor Emmanuel</a> in the small role of Sgt. Johnson. <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a> and Martin's son <a href="Larry%20Hagman">Larry Hagman</a>, both at the start of their careers, played Seabees in the London production; <a href="Julie%20Wilson">Julie Wilson</a> eventually replaced Martin. On January 31, 1952, King <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a> attended the production with his daughter <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Princess Elizabeth</a> and other members of the Royal Family. He died less than a week later.

The Broadway production transferred to the <a href="Broadway%20Theatre%20%2853rd%20Street%29">Broadway Theatre</a> in June 1953 to accommodate Rodgers and Hammerstein's new show, "<a href="Me%20and%20Juliet">Me and Juliet</a>", although "South Pacific" had to be moved to Boston for five weeks because of schedule conflicts. When it closed on January 16, 1954, after 1,925 performances, it was the <a href="List%20of%20the%20longest-running%20Broadway%20shows">second-longest-running musical</a> in Broadway history, after "Oklahoma!". At the final performance, Myron McCormick, the only cast member remaining from the opening, led the performers and audience in "<a href="Auld%20Lang%20Syne">Auld Lang Syne</a>"; the curtain did not fall but remained raised as the audience left the theatre.

On a South Pacific island during World War II, two half-<a href="Polynesians">Polynesian</a> children, Ngana and Jerome, happily sing as they play together ("Dites-Moi"). Ensign Nellie Forbush, a naïve <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> nurse from <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock, Arkansas</a>, has fallen in love with Emile de Becque, a middle-aged French plantation owner, though she has known him only briefly. Even though everyone else is worried about the outcome of the war, Nellie tells Emile that she is sure everything will turn out all right ("A Cockeyed Optimist"). Emile also loves Nellie, and each wonders if the other reciprocates those feelings ("Twin Soliloquies"). Emile expresses his love for Nellie, recalling how they met at the officers' club dance and instantly were attracted to each other ("<a href="Some%20Enchanted%20Evening">Some Enchanted Evening</a>"). Nellie, promising to think about their relationship, returns to the hospital. Emile calls Ngana and Jerome to him, revealing to the audience that they are his children, unbeknownst to Nellie.

Meanwhile, the restless American <a href="Seabees%20in%20World%20War%20II">Seabees</a>, led by crafty Luther Billis, lament the absence of available women – Navy nurses are commissioned officers and off-limits to enlisted men. There is one civilian woman on the island, nicknamed "Bloody Mary", a sassy middle-aged <a href="Tonkin">Tonkin</a>ese vendor of grass skirts, who engages the sailors in sarcastic, flirtatious banter as she tries to sell them her wares ("Bloody Mary"). Billis yearns to visit the nearby island of Bali Ha'i – which is off-limits to all but officers – supposedly to witness a Boar's Tooth Ceremony (at which he can get an unusual native artifact); the other sailors josh him, saying that his real motivation is to see the young French women there. Billis and the sailors further lament their lack of feminine companionship ("<a href="There%20Is%20Nothing%20Like%20a%20Dame">There Is Nothing Like a Dame</a>").
<a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">U.S. Marine</a> <a href="Lieutenant%23Marine%20rank">Lieutenant</a> Cable arrives on the island from <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a>, having been sent to take part in a dangerous spy mission whose success could turn the tide of the war against Japan. Bloody Mary tries to persuade Cable to visit "<a href="Bali%20Ha%27i">Bali Ha'i</a>", mysteriously telling him that it is "his" special island. Billis, seeing an opportunity, urges Cable to go. Cable meets with his commanding officers, <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">Captain</a> George Brackett and <a href="Commander%20%28United%20States%29%23Naval%20rank">Commander</a> William Harbison, who plan to ask Emile to help with the mission because he used to live on the island where the mission will take place. They ask Nellie to help them find out more about Emile's background, for example, his politics and why he left France. They have heard, for instance, that Emile committed a murder, and this might make him less than desirable for such a mission.

After thinking a bit more about Emile and deciding she has become attracted on the basis of little knowledge of him, Nellie tells the other nurses that she intends to end her relationship with him ("<a href="I%27m%20Gonna%20Wash%20That%20Man%20Right%20Outa%20My%20Hair">I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair</a>"). When he arrives unexpectedly and invites Nellie to a party where he will introduce her to his friends, however, she accepts. Emile declares his love for Nellie and asks her to marry him. When she mentions politics, he speaks of universal freedom, and describes fleeing France after standing up against a bully, who died accidentally as the two fought. After hearing this, Nellie agrees to marry Emile. After he exits, Nellie joyously gives voice to her feelings ("<a href="I%27m%20in%20Love%20with%20a%20Wonderful%20Guy">I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy</a>").
Cable's mission is to land on a Japanese-held island and report on Japanese ship movements. The Navy officers ask Emile to be Cable's guide, but he refuses their request because of his hopes for a new life with Nellie. Commander Harbison, the executive officer, tells Cable to go on leave until the mission can take place, and Billis obtains a boat and takes Cable to Bali Ha'i. There, Billis participates in the native ceremony, while Bloody Mary introduces Cable to her beautiful daughter, Liat, with whom he must communicate haltingly in French. Believing that Liat's only chance at a better life is to marry an American officer, Mary leaves Liat alone with Cable. The two are instantly attracted to each other and make love ("<a href="Younger%20Than%20Springtime">Younger Than Springtime</a>"). Billis and the rest of the crew are ready to leave the island, yet must wait for Cable who, unbeknownst to them, is with Liat ("Bali Ha'i" (reprise)). Bloody Mary proudly tells Billis that Cable is going to be her son-in-law.

Meanwhile, after Emile's party, Nellie and he reflect on how happy they are to be in love (Reprises of "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy", "Twin Soliloquies", "Cockeyed Optimist" and "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair"). Emile introduces Nellie to Jerome and Ngana. Though she finds them charming, she is shocked when Emile reveals that they are his children by his first wife, a dark-skinned Polynesian woman, now deceased. Nellie is unable to overcome her deep-seated racial prejudices and tearfully leaves Emile, after which he reflects sadly on what might have been ("Some Enchanted Evening" (reprise)).

It is <a href="Thanksgiving%20%28United%20States%29">Thanksgiving Day</a>. The GIs and nurses dance in a holiday revue titled "Thanksgiving Follies". In the past week, an epidemic of <a href="malaria">malaria</a> has hit the island of Bali Ha'i. Having visited Bali Ha'i often to be with Liat, Cable is also ill, but escapes from the hospital to be with Liat. As Liat and Cable spend more time together, Bloody Mary is delighted. She encourages them to continue their carefree life on the island ("<a href="Happy%20Talk%20%28song%29">Happy Talk</a>") and urges them to marry. Cable, aware of his family's prejudices, says he cannot marry a Tonkinese girl. Bloody Mary furiously drags her distraught daughter away, telling Cable that Liat must now marry a much older French plantation owner instead. Cable laments his loss. ("Younger Than Springtime" (reprise)).

For the final number of the Thanksgiving Follies, Nellie performs a comedy burlesque dressed as a sailor singing the praises of "his" sweetheart ("Honey Bun"). Billis plays Honey Bun, dressed in a blond wig, grass skirt and coconut-shell bra. After the show, Emile asks Nellie to reconsider. She insists that she cannot feel the same way about him since she knows about his children's Polynesian mother. Frustrated and uncomprehending, Emile asks Cable why he and Nellie have such prejudices. Cable, filled with self-loathing, replies that "it's not something you're born with", yet it is an ingrained part of their upbringing ("<a href="You%27ve%20Got%20to%20Be%20Carefully%20Taught">You've Got to Be Carefully Taught</a>"). He also vows that if he gets out of the war alive, he won't go home to the United States; everything he wants is on these islands. Emile imagines what might have been ("This Nearly Was Mine"). Dejected and feeling that he has nothing to lose, he agrees to join Cable on his dangerous mission.
The mission begins with plenty of air support. Offstage, Billis stows away on the plane, falls out when the plane is hit by anti-aircraft fire, and ends up in the ocean waiting to be rescued; the massive rescue operation inadvertently becomes a diversion that allows Emile and Cable to land on the other side of the island undetected. The two send back reports on Japanese ships' movements in the "Slot", a strategic strait; American aircraft intercept and destroy the Japanese ships. When the Japanese <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M">Zeros</a> strafe the Americans' position, Emile narrowly escapes, but Cable is killed.

Nellie learns of Cable's death and that Emile is missing. She realizes that she was foolish to reject Emile because of the race of his children's mother. Bloody Mary and Liat come to Nellie asking where Cable is; Mary explains that Liat refuses to marry anyone but him. Nellie comforts Liat. Cable and Emile's espionage work has made it possible for a major offensive, Operation "Alligator", to begin. The previously idle fighting men, including Billis, go off to battle.

Nellie spends time with Jerome and Ngana and soon comes to love them. While the children are teaching her to sing "Dites-Moi," suddenly Emile's voice joins them. Emile has returned to discover that Nellie has overcome her prejudices and has fallen in love with his children. Emile, Nellie and the children rejoice ("Dites-Moi" (reprise)).

A number of songs were extensively modified or omitted in the weeks leading up to the initial Broadway opening. They are listed in the order of their one-time placement within the show:


The first Australian production opened in September 1952 at <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Theatre%2C%20Melbourne">His Majesty's Theatre</a> in Melbourne, playing for 10 months and 333 performances. It then played seasons in Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide until late 1954, before returning to Melbourne for a further season.

A limited run of "South Pacific" by the New York City Center Light Opera Company opened at <a href="New%20York%20City%20Center">New York City Center</a> on May 4, 1955, closing on May 15, 1955.

That production was given again in 1961, this time with Ann McLerie and <a href="William%20Chapman%20%28baritone%29">William Chapman</a> in the lead roles.

There have been many stock or summer revivals of "South Pacific". One, in 1957 at Long Island's <a href="Westbury%20Music%20Fair">Westbury Music Fair</a>, occurred at the same time that Arkansas Governor <a href="Orval%20Faubus">Orval Faubus</a> was resisting the integration of <a href="Little%20Rock%20Central%20High%20School">Central High School</a> by the <a href="Little%20Rock%20Nine">Little Rock Nine</a>. Nellie's pronouncement that she was from Little Rock was initially met with boos. Logan refused to allow Nellie's hometown to be changed, so a speech was made before each performance asking for the audience's forbearance, which was forthcoming.

There were two revivals at <a href="Lincoln%20Center">Lincoln Center</a>. Richard Rodgers produced the 1967 revival, which starred <a href="Florence%20Henderson">Florence Henderson</a> and <a href="Giorgio%20Tozzi">Giorgio Tozzi</a>, who had been <a href="Rossano%20Brazzi">Rossano Brazzi</a>'s singing voice in the 1958 film. <a href="Joe%20Layton">Joe Layton</a> was the director. The cast album was issued on <a href="LP%20record">LP</a> and later on CD. The musical toured North America from 1986 to 1988, headlined by <a href="Robert%20Goulet">Robert Goulet</a> and <a href="Barbara%20Eden">Barbara Eden</a>, with <a href="David%20Carroll%20%28actor%29">David Carroll</a> as Cable, <a href="Armelia%20McQueen">Armelia McQueen</a> as Bloody Mary and <a href="Lia%20Chang">Lia Chang</a> as Liat, first directed by <a href="Geraldine%20Fitzgerald">Geraldine Fitzgerald</a> and then <a href="Ron%20Field">Ron Field</a>.

A 1988 West End revival starred <a href="Gemma%20Craven">Gemma Craven</a> and <a href="Emile%20Belcourt">Emile Belcourt</a>, supported by <a href="Bertice%20Reading">Bertice Reading</a>, among others, and was directed by Roger Redfern. It ran at the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales%20Theatre">Prince of Wales Theatre</a> from January 20, 1988 to January 14, 1989.

A new production with slight revisions to the book and score was produced by the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">Royal National Theatre</a> at the company's Olivier Theatre in London for a limited run from December 2001 through April 2002, timed to celebrate the centenary of Richard Rodgers' birth. <a href="Trevor%20Nunn">Trevor Nunn</a> directed, with musical staging by <a href="Matthew%20Bourne">Matthew Bourne</a> and designs by <a href="John%20Napier%20%28designer%29">John Napier</a>. <a href="Lauren%20Kennedy">Lauren Kennedy</a> was Nellie, and Australian actor <a href="Philip%20Quast">Philip Quast</a> played Emile, Borrowing from the 1958 film, this production placed the first Emile-Nellie scene after the introduction of Cable, Billis and Bloody Mary.

A British touring production of "South Pacific" opened at the <a href="Blackpool%20Grand%20Theatre">Blackpool Grand Theatre</a> on August 28, 2007. The tour ended at the <a href="New%20Theatre%20%28Cardiff%29">Cardiff New Theatre</a> on July 19, 2008. It starred <a href="Helena%20Blackman">Helena Blackman</a> as Nellie and <a href="Dave%20Willetts">Dave Willetts</a> as Emile. <a href="Julian%20Woolford">Julian Woolford</a> directed, with choreography by Chris Hocking. This production was most noted for its staging of the overture, which charted Nellie's journey from <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock, Arkansas</a>, to the South Pacific. On entering the theatre, the audience first saw a map of the U.S., not the theater of war.

A Broadway revival of "South Pacific" opened on April 3, 2008 at <a href="Lincoln%20Center%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts">Lincoln Center's</a> <a href="Vivian%20Beaumont%20Theater">Vivian Beaumont Theater</a>. <a href="Bartlett%20Sher">Bartlett Sher</a> directed, with musical staging by <a href="Christopher%20Gattelli">Christopher Gattelli</a> and associate choreographer <a href="Joe%20Langworth">Joe Langworth</a>.

Szot alternated with David Pittsinger as Emile. The production closed on August 22, 2010, after 37 previews and 996 regular performances.

With a few exceptions, the production received rave reviews. <a href="Ben%20Brantley">Ben Brantley</a> wrote in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>":
The production, with most of the original principals, was taped and broadcast live in <a href="High-definition%20television">HD</a> on August 18, 2010 on the <a href="PBS">PBS</a> television show "<a href="Live%20from%20Lincoln%20Center">Live from Lincoln Center</a>".

A production based on the 2008 Broadway revival opened at the <a href="Barbican%20Theatre">Barbican Theatre</a> in London on August 15, 2011 and closed on October 1, 2011. Sher again directed, with the same creative team from the Broadway revival. Szot and <a href="Welsh%20National%20Opera">Welsh National Opera</a> singer Jason Howard alternated in the role of Emile, with <a href="Samantha%20Womack">Samantha Womack</a> as Nellie, Ables Sayre as Bloody Mary and <a href="Alex%20Ferns">Alex Ferns</a> as Billis. The production received mostly positive reviews. A U.K tour followed, with Womack, Ables Sayre and Ferns.

A U.S. national tour based on the 2008 revival began in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> at the <a href="Golden%20Gate%20Theatre">Golden Gate Theatre</a> on September 18, 2009. Sher directed, and the cast starred <a href="Rod%20Gilfry">Rod Gilfry</a> (Emile) and <a href="Carmen%20Cusack">Carmen Cusack</a> (Nellie). The Sher production was also produced by <a href="Opera%20Australia">Opera Australia</a> at the <a href="Sydney%20Opera%20House">Sydney Opera House</a> from August to September 2012 and then at <a href="Princess%20Theatre%2C%20Melbourne">Princess Theatre, Melbourne</a> through October 2012. It starred <a href="Teddy%20Tahu%20Rhodes">Teddy Tahu Rhodes</a> as Emile, <a href="Lisa%20McCune">Lisa McCune</a> as Nellie, <a href="Kate%20Ceberano">Kate Ceberano</a> as Bloody Mary and <a href="Eddie%20Perfect">Eddie Perfect</a> as Billis. The production then played in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> for the 2012 holiday season, with <a href="Christine%20Anu">Christine Anu</a> as Bloody Mary, and resumed touring in Australia in September 2013.

Reviewers gave the original production uniformly glowing reviews; one critic called it "South Terrific". The "<a href="New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</a>" wrote:
The "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20Mirror">New York Daily Mirror</a>" critic wrote, "Programmed as a musical play, "South Pacific" is just that. It boasts no ballets and no hot hoofing. It has no chorus in the conventional sense. Every one in it plays a part. It is likely to establish a new trend in musicals." The review continued: "Every number is so outstanding that it is difficult to decide which will be the most popular." The review in "<a href="New%20York%20World-Telegram">New York World-Telegram</a>" found the show to be "the ultimate modern blending of music and popular theatre to date, with the finest kind of balance between story and song, and hilarity and heartbreak." <a href="Brooks%20Atkinson">Brooks Atkinson</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" especially praised Pinza's performance: "Mr. Pinza's bass voice is the most beautiful that has been heard on a Broadway stage for an eon or two. He sings ... with infinite delicacy of feeling and loveliness of tone." He declared that "Some Enchanted Evening", sung by Pinza, "ought to become reasonably immortal." <a href="Richard%20Watts%2C%20Jr.">Richard Watts, Jr.</a> of the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" focused on Mary Martin's performance, writing, "nothing I have ever seen her do prepared me for the loveliness, humor, gift for joyous characterization, and sheer lovableness of her portrayal of Nellie Forbush ... who is so shocked to find her early racial prejudices cropping up. Hers is a completely irresistible performance."

When "South Pacific" opened in London in November 1951, the reviews were mixed. London's "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" praised the music but disliked other elements of that show, writing, "We got a 42nd Street "Madame Butterfly", the weakest of all the Hammerstein-Rodgers musicals. The "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" suggested, "The play moved so slowly between its songs that it seemed more like "South Soporific"." "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" applauded the songs but indicated that "before the end the singing and the dancing have dwindled to almost nothing, while the rather sad little tale is slowly and conventionally wound up." "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>", however, noted the anticipation in advance of the opening and concluded that "there was no disappointment ... the show bounces the audience and well deserves the cheers." Drama critic <a href="Kenneth%20Tynan">Kenneth Tynan</a> of "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>" wrote that "South Pacific" was "the first musical romance which was seriously involved in an adult subject ... I have nothing to do but thank Logan, Rodgers and Hammerstein and climb up from my knees, a little cramped from the effort of typing in such an unusual position."

A 2006 review asserted: "Many are the knowledgeable and discriminating people for whom Rodgers and Hammerstein's "South Pacific", brilliantly co-written and staged by Joshua Logan, was the greatest musical of all." In 1987, however, <a href="John%20Rockwell">John Rockwell</a> of "The New York Times" reviewed the City Opera production, commenting that while "South Pacific" had been innovative for 1949, "<a href="Stephen%20Sondheim">Sondheim</a> has long since transcended its formal innovations, and the constant reprises of the big tunes sound mechanical. In 1949, "South Pacific" epitomized the concerns of the day – America's responsibilities in the world and the dangers of racism. ... At its 1967 State Theater revival, the show struck many as dated. It still seems that way, with "M*A*S*H" having contemporized this same setting". A 2008 "<a href="Huffington%20Post">Huffington Post</a>" review criticized the play as having an Orientalist and Western-centric storyline in which stereotypical natives take on "exotic background roles" in relation to Americans, and it characterized the relationship between Cable and Liat as underage prostitution, charging that she "speaks not a word in the whole musical, only smiles and takes the Yankee to bed." "South Pacific" is the only major American musical set in World War II, but former Marine <a href="Robert%20Leckie%20%28author%29">Robert Leckie</a> wrote his memoir of that conflict, "<a href="Helmet%20for%20My%20Pillow">Helmet for My Pillow</a>", after he walked out of a performance: "I have to tell the story of how it really was. I have to let people know the war wasn't a musical."

"South Pacific" opened on Broadway with $400,000 in advance sales. People were so eager to obtain tickets that the press wrote about the lengths people had gone to in getting them. Because "house seats" were being sold by <a href="ticket%20resale">scalpers</a> for $200 or more, the attorney general's office threatened to close the show. However, the parties who provided the scalpers with the tickets were never identified, and the show ran without interference. The production had a $50,600 weekly gross, and ran for 1,925 performances. The national tour began in 1950 and grossed $3,000,000 in the first year, making $1,500,000 in profit. The <a href="Cast%20recording">original cast album</a>, priced at $4.85, sold more than a million copies.

The original production of "South Pacific" won ten Tony Awards, including Best Musical, Best Male Performer (Pinza), Best Female Performer (Martin), Best Supporting Male Performer (McCormick), Best Supporting Female Performer (Hall), Best Director (Logan), Best Book and Best Score. As of 2016, it is the only show to win Tonys in all four acting categories. In 1950, the musical won the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Drama">Pulitzer Prize for Drama</a>, the second musical to do so after "<a href="Of%20Thee%20I%20Sing">Of Thee I Sing</a>", which won in 1932. Rodgers became the first composer of musical comedy to win the Pulitzer, as composer <a href="George%20Gershwin">George Gershwin</a> had not been recognized for "Of Thee I Sing". The Pulitzer Prize was initially given only to Rodgers and Hammerstein; Logan was later recognized in an amended announcement, much to his annoyance.

The 2001 London revival garnered a <a href="Laurence%20Olivier%20Award">Laurence Olivier Award</a> for <a href="Philip%20Quast">Philip Quast</a> (Emile). The 2008 revival won seven Tony Awards, including Best Revival (Sher and Szot also won, and the show won in all four design categories), and five <a href="Drama%20Desk%20Award">Drama Desk Award</a>s, including Outstanding Musical Revival. The late <a href="Robert%20Russell%20Bennett">Robert Russell Bennett</a> was also honored that season for "his historic contribution to American musical theatre in the field of orchestrations, as represented on Broadway this season by Rodgers and Hammerstein's "South Pacific"." As of 2016, this was the musical revival with the most Tony Awards. The 2011 London production received three <a href="Olivier%20Award">Olivier Award</a> nominations, including Best Musical Revival, but won none.

Part of the reason why "South Pacific" is considered a classic is its confrontation of racism. According to professor <a href="Philip%20Beidler">Philip Beidler</a>, "Rodgers and Hammerstein's attempt to use the Broadway theater to make a courageous statement against racial bigotry in general and institutional racism in the postwar United States in particular" forms part of "South Pacific" 's legend. Although "Tales of the South Pacific" treats the question of racism, it does not give it the central place that it takes in the musical. Andrea Most, writing on the "politics of race" in "South Pacific", suggests that in the late 1940s, American liberals, such as Rodgers and Hammerstein, turned to the fight for racial equality as a practical means of advancing their progressive views without risking being deemed communists. <a href="Trevor%20Nunn">Trevor Nunn</a>, director of the 2001 West End production, notes the importance of the fact that Nellie, a southerner, ends the play about to be the mother in an interracial family: "It's being performed in America in 1949. That's the resonance."

From the early drafts, Hammerstein and Logan made the issue of racial prejudice central to the story. Hammerstein repeatedly rewrote the Act II backstage scene where Emile, Nellie and Cable confront the question of the Americans' racism. As critic Robert Butler pointed out in his educational companion to the 2001 London production, "if one young person has a prejudice, it might be a character flaw; if two young people share a prejudice, it tells us something about the society in which they grew up". In one draft, Emile advises that the Americans are no better than the Axis Powers, in their prejudice, and suggests they go home to sing songs about how all are created free and equal. Lovensheimer states that a postwar American audience would have found such onstage sentiments to be offensive. In the staged version, Emile's expressions are limited to two lines arguing that prejudice is not inborn.
At the heart of this scene is Cable's song "<a href="You%27ve%20Got%20to%20Be%20Carefully%20Taught">You've Got to Be Carefully Taught</a>", in which Cable realizes the sources of his own racism. Its frank lyrics made it perhaps the most controversial element of the show. Michener recalled in his memoirs that a delegation of New Englanders had approached him after a New Haven tryout and urged him to recommend the song's removal to Rodgers and Hammerstein. When Michener told Hammerstein, he laughed and replied, "That's what the show is about!" Boston drama critic Elliot Norton, after seeing the show in tryouts, strongly recommended its removal, or at least that Cable sing it less "briskly", as there was much bigotry in Boston; Logan replied that that was all the more reason for leaving it unaltered. Several New York reviewers expressed discomfort with the song; <a href="Wolcott%20Gibbs">Wolcott Gibbs</a> wrote of "something called 'You've Got to Be Taught', a poem in praise of tolerance that somehow I found a little embarrassing" while <a href="John%20Mason%20Brown">John Mason Brown</a> opined that he was "somewhat distressed by the dragged-in didacticism of such a plea for tolerance as 'You've Got to Be Taught'". After the Broadway opening, Hammerstein received a large number of letters concerning "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught". Judging by the letters that remain among his papers in the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>, the reaction was mixed. One correspondent wrote "What can I say to a man who writes, 'You've got to be taught to hate and fear?' ... Now that I know you, I feel that my informants didn't praise you enough." Nevertheless, another wrote, "I feel the inclusion of the song particularly in the album and to some extent in the show itself is not helpful to the cause of brotherhood, your intent to the contrary notwithstanding".

When the tour of the show reached a racially segregated theatre in <a href="Wilmington%2C%20Delaware">Wilmington, Delaware</a>, Rodgers and Hammerstein threatened to cancel the performances there unless seating was integrated, which it was. In 1953, with the tour in Atlanta, there was controversy over "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught". Two Georgia state legislators, Senator John D. Shepard and Representative David C. Jones, objected to the song, stating that though "South Pacific" was a fine piece of entertainment, that song "contained an underlying philosophy inspired by Moscow", and explained, "Intermarriage produces half-breeds. And half-breeds are not conducive to the higher type of society. ... In the South, we have pure blood lines and we intend to keep it that way." They stated that they planned to introduce legislation to outlaw such communist-inspired works. The Northern press had a field day; Hammerstein, when asked for comment, responded that he did not think the legislators were representing their constituents very well, and that he was surprised at the suggestion that anything kind and decent must necessarily originate in Moscow. In part because of the song, touring companies of "South Pacific" had difficulty getting bookings in the Deep South.
In the final scene of Act I, Nellie rejects Emile because of his part-Polynesian children. In so doing, Nellie fails to live up to the American ideal that "all men are created equal", which Emile had earlier affirmed. This scene was also toned down by Hammerstein; in early drafts, Nellie, initially unable to force out a word to describe Emile's first wife, after he supplies the word "Polynesian", responds with "colored". This pronouncement, which makes Nellie less sympathetic as a character, was restored for the 2008 Lincoln Center production. As <a href="Frank%20Rich">Frank Rich</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" commented, "it's upsetting because Nellie isn't some cracker stereotype – she's lovable ... But how can we love a racist?" Most argues that even Emile is tainted by racism, as his lifestyle is dependent on the maintenance of a system whereby he benefits from underpaid native labor – Bloody Mary is able to attract workers to make grass skirts for sale to GIs because, as she puts it, "French planters stingy bastards!"

Nellie Forbush, in her journey from Little Rock, Arkansas, to serving as a Navy nurse and on to the domesticity of the final scene of "South Pacific", parallels the experience of many American women of the period. They entered the workforce during the war, only to find afterwards a societal expectation that they give up their jobs to men, with their best route to financial security being marriage and becoming a housewife. One means of securing audience acceptance of Nellie's choices was the sanitization of her sexual past from her counterpart in the Michener work – that character had a <a href="4-F%20%28US%20Military%29">4-F</a> boyfriend back in Arkansas and a liaison with Bill Harbison while on the island.
The male characters in "South Pacific" are intended to appear conventionally masculine. In the aftermath of World War II, the masculinity of the American soldier was beyond public question. Cable's virility with Liat is made evident to the audience. Although Billis operates a laundry – Nellie particularly praises his pleats – and appears in a grass skirt in the "Thanksgiving Follies", these acts are consistent with his desire for money and are clearly intended to be comic. His interest in the young women on Bali H'ai establishes his masculinity. Lovensheimer writes that Billis is more defined by class than by sexuality, evidenced by the Seabee's assumption, on learning that Cable went to college in New Jersey, that it was <a href="Rutgers%20University">Rutgers</a> (the state's flagship public university), rather than <a href="Ivy%20League">Ivy League</a> Princeton, and by his delight on learning that the rescue operation for him had cost $600,000 when his uncle had told him he would never be worth a dime.

Meryle Secrest, in her biography of Rodgers, theorizes that "South Pacific" marks a transition for the pair "between heroes and heroines who are more or less evenly matched in age and stories about powerful older men and the younger women who are attracted to them". Lovensheimer, however, points out that this pattern really only holds for two of their five subsequent musicals, "The King and I" and "<a href="The%20Sound%20of%20Music">The Sound of Music</a>", and in the former, the love between Anna and the King is not expressed in words. He believes a different transition took place: that their plots, beginning with "South Pacific", involve a woman needing to enter and accept her love interest's world to be successful and accepted herself. He notes that both "Oklahoma!" and "Carousel" involve a man entering his wife's world, Curly in "Oklahoma!" about to become a farmer with expectations of success, whereas Billy Bigelow in "Carousel" fails to find work after leaving his place as a barker. Lovensheimer deems "Allegro" to be a transition, where the attempts of the lead female character to alter her husband Joe's world to suit her ambition lead to the breakup of their marriage. He argues that the nurse Emily, who goes with Joe in his return to the small town where he was happy, is a forerunner of Nellie, uprooting her life in Chicago for Joe.

Secrest notes that much is overlooked in the rush to have love conquer all in "South Pacific", "questions of the long-term survival of a marriage between a sophisticate who read Proust at bedtime and a girl who liked Dinah Shore and did not read anything were raised by Nellie Forbush only to be brushed aside. As for the interracial complexities of raising two Polynesian children, all such issues were subsumed in the general euphoria of true love." Lovensheimer too wonders how Nellie will fare as the second Madame de Becque, "little Nellie Forbush from Arkansas ends up in a tropical paradise, far from her previous world, with a husband, a servant, and two children who speak a language she does not understand".

A mammoth hit, "South Pacific" sparked huge media and public attention. "South Pacific" was one of the first shows for which a variety of souvenirs were available: fans could buy "South Pacific" neckties, or for women, lipstick and scarves. Fake ticket stubs could be purchased for use as status symbols. There were "South Pacific" music boxes, dolls, fashion accessories, and even hairbrushes for use after washing men from hair. Martin's on-stage shower prompted an immediate fashion craze for short hair that could be managed through once-a-day washing at home, rather than in a beauty salon, and for the products which would allow for such care. The songs of "South Pacific" could be heard on the radio, and they were popular among dance bands and in piano lounges. Mordden comments that "South Pacific" contained nothing but hit songs; Rodgers and Hammerstein's other successful works always included at least one song which did not become popular.

The cast album, recorded ten days after the show's opening, was an immediate hit. Released by <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>, it spent 69 weeks at #1 on Billboard and a total of 400 weeks on the charts, becoming the best-selling record of the 1940s. It was one of the early <a href="LP%20record">LP record</a>s, with a turntable speed of 33⅓ rpm, and helped to popularize that technology – previously, show albums and operas had been issued on sets of 78 rpm records, with high prices and much less music on a single disc. In the years to come, the LP would become the medium of choice for the "longhair" music niche of show, opera and classical performances.

An indirect effect of the success of the show was the career of James Michener. His one percent of the show as author of the source material, plus the income from a share which the duo allowed him to buy on credit, made him financially independent and allowed him to quit his job as an editor at Macmillan and to become a full-time writer. Over the next five decades, his lengthy, detailed novels centering on different places would dominate the bestseller lists.

The role of Nellie Forbush was the first time with Hammerstein that Rodgers made the leading female role a <a href="belt%20%28music%29">belter</a>, rather than a <a href="lyric%20soprano">lyric soprano</a> like Laurey in "Oklahoma!" and Julie in "Carousel". According to Mordden, "Nellie was something new in R&H, carrying a goodly share of the score on a 'Broadway' voice".

Nellie does not sing together with Emile, because Rodgers promised Martin that she would not have to compete vocally with Pinza, but the composer sought to unite them in the underlying music. A <a href="tetrachord">tetrachord</a>, heard before we see either lead, is played during the instrumental introduction to ""Dites-Moi" ", the show's first song. Considered as pitch classes, that is, as pitches without characterization by octave or register, the motif is C-B-A-G. It will be heard repeatedly in Nellie's music, or in the music (such as "Twin Soliloquies") that she shares with Emile, and even in the bridge of "Some Enchanted Evening". Lovensheimer argues that this symbolizes what Nellie is trying to say with her Act II line "We're the same sort of people fundamentally – you and me".

Originally, "Twin Soliloquies" came to an end shortly after the vocal part finishes. Logan found this unsatisfying and worked with Trude Rittmann to find a better ending to the song. This piece of music, dubbed "Unspoken Thoughts", continues the music as Nellie and Emile sip brandy together, and is called by Lovensheimer "the one truly operatic moment of the score". "This Nearly Was Mine" is a big bass solo for Emile in waltz time, deemed by Rodgers biographer William G. Hyland as "one of his finest efforts". Only five notes are used in the first four bars, a phrase which is then repeated with a slight variation in the following four bars. The song ends an octave higher than where it began, making it perfect for Pinza's voice.

Two songs, "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair" and "Honey Bun" are intended to imitate American popular songs of the 1940s. In the former, the triple recitation of the song title at intervals suggests a <a href="big%20band">big band</a> arrangement of the wartime era, while in the bridge, the final eight bars (repeating the lyrics from the bridge's first eight bars) gives a suggestion of <a href="swing%20music">swing</a>. The sections beginning "If the man don't understand you" and "If you laugh at different comics" have a <a href="blues">blues</a> style. Lovensheimer deems the song "Nellie's spontaneous and improvisatory expression of her feelings through the vocabulary of popular song". Mordden suggests that "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy" with its "take no prisoners bounce", might well be the center of the score, with the typical American girl defending her love by spouting clichés, many of which, such as "corny as Kansas in August" Hammerstein made up, and "sure enough, over the years they have become clichés".

<a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> recorded the overture and most of the songs from the original production in 1949, using members of the cast including <a href="Ezio%20Pinza">Ezio Pinza</a> and <a href="Mary%20Martin">Mary Martin</a>. Drawing from the original <a href="Acetate%20disc">lacquer disc</a> masters, Columbia released the album in both the new LP format and on 78-rpm discs. Soon after Sony acquired Columbia in 1988, a CD was released from the previously unused magnetic tape recording from the same 1949 sessions in New York City. The CD includes the bonus tracks "Loneliness of Evening" (recorded in 1949 by Mary Martin), "My Girl Back Home" (Martin), "Bali Ha'i" (Pinza) and Symphonic Scenario for Concert Orchestra (original orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett). According to critic <a href="John%20Kenrick%20%28theatre%20writer%29">John Kenrick</a>, the original cast recording "is the rare stuff that lasting legends are made of", an essential classic. The original cast album was added to the <a href="National%20Recording%20Registry">National Recording Registry</a> in the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> on March 21, 2013 for long-term preservation. The film soundtrack was released on the <a href="RCA%20Records">RCA Victor</a> label in March 1958. Kenrick calls the recording "mixed up" and does not recommend it.

Masterworks Broadway released a recording of the 1967 Lincoln Center production starring <a href="Florence%20Henderson">Florence Henderson</a> as Nellie, <a href="Giorgio%20Tozzi">Giorgio Tozzi</a> as Emile, Justin McDonough as Cable and Irene Byatt as Bloody Mary. The recording includes a version of "Bali Ha'i", sung in French by <a href="Eleanor%20Calbes">Eleanor Calbes</a>, the Liat. According to Kenrick, "Every track of this 1967 Lincoln Center cast recording is such a winner that you can't help wondering why it took so long for this winner to make its way to CD." Kenrick notes that the album is a more complete alternative to the original cast album.

In 1986 <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Carreras">José Carreras</a> and <a href="Kiri%20Te%20Kanawa">Kiri Te Kanawa</a> made a studio recording of "South Pacific", the sessions of which were filmed as a documentary, similar in style to <a href="Leonard%20Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a>'s successful "<a href="West%20Side%20Story%20%28musical%29">West Side Story</a>" documentary a year earlier that featured the same stars. Emile's music was transposed to fit Carreras's tenor voice. The recording also featured <a href="Sarah%20Vaughan">Sarah Vaughan</a> as Bloody Mary and <a href="Mandy%20Patinkin">Mandy Patinkin</a> as Cable. Stephen Holden reviewed the album in "The New York Times", "the star of this "South Pacific" isn't any individual, but rather the score itself". Kenrick calls the recording badly miscast "pretentious trash." Kenrick gives mixed praise to the 1988 London revival cast album.

The 2001 Royal National Theatre's revival cast album was recorded in 2002 on First Night Records with <a href="Philip%20Quast">Philip Quast</a> as Emile, <a href="Lauren%20Kennedy">Lauren Kennedy</a> as Nellie, <a href="Edward%20Baker-Duly">Edward Baker-Duly</a> as Cable, Sheila Francisco as Bloody Mary and <a href="Nick%20Holder">Nick Holder</a> as Billis. The album includes the cut song, "Now Is the Time". While Kenrick allows that most critics like the recording, he finds it a waste of money. The 2005 <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a> concert version was released on April 18, 2006 by <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca</a> Broadway with <a href="Reba%20McEntire">Reba McEntire</a> as Nellie, <a href="Brian%20Stokes%20Mitchell">Brian Stokes Mitchell</a> as Emile, <a href="Lillias%20White">Lillias White</a> as Bloody Mary, <a href="Jason%20Danieley">Jason Danieley</a> as Cable and <a href="Alec%20Baldwin">Alec Baldwin</a> as Billis. Kenrick describes this recording as "one of the most ravishing that this glorious Rodgers & Hammerstein classic has ever received" and "a show tune lover's dream come true." The 2008 Broadway revival cast album was released on May 27, 2008 by Masterworks Broadway. Kenrick finds it "very satisfying".

"South Pacific" was made into a <a href="South%20Pacific%20%281958%20film%29">film of the same name</a> in 1958, and it topped the box office that year. <a href="Joshua%20Logan">Joshua Logan</a> directed the film, which starred <a href="Rossano%20Brazzi">Rossano Brazzi</a>, <a href="Mitzi%20Gaynor">Mitzi Gaynor</a>, <a href="John%20Kerr%20%28actor%29">John Kerr</a>, <a href="Ray%20Walston">Ray Walston</a> and <a href="Juanita%20Hall">Juanita Hall</a>; all of their singing voices except Gaynor's and Walston's were dubbed. <a href="Thurl%20Ravenscroft">Thurl Ravenscroft</a>, later television's <a href="Tony%20the%20Tiger">Tony the Tiger</a>, sang the <a href="basso%20profundo">basso profundo</a> notes in "There Is Nothing Like a Dame". The film opened with Cable's flight to the island in a <a href="PBY">PBY</a>, followed by the Seabees' beach scene, and added Billis' rescue and scenes from the mission to spy on the Japanese. The film won the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Sound">Academy Award for Best Sound</a>. It was also nominated for the Oscar for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Score">Best Scoring of a Musical Picture</a> (Alfred Newman and Ken Darby), and the 65 mm <a href="Todd-AO">Todd-AO</a> cinematography by <a href="Leon%20Shamroy">Leon Shamroy</a> was also nominated. The film was widely criticized for its use of color to indicate mood, with actors changing color as they began to sing. The film includes the song "My Girl Back Home", sung by Cable, which was cut from the stage musical. The movie was the third-highest-grossing film in the U.S. of the 1950s; its UK revenues were the highest ever, a record it kept until "<a href="Goldfinger%20%28film%29">Goldfinger</a>" in 1963. Although reviewers have criticized the film – <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">"Time" magazine</a> stated that it was "almost impossible to make a bad movie out of it – but the moviemakers appear to have tried" – it has added success on television, videotape and DVD to its box office laurels.

A <a href="South%20Pacific%20%282001%20film%29">made-for-television film</a>, directed by <a href="Richard%20Pearce%20%28director%29">Richard Pearce</a>, was produced and televised in 2001, starring <a href="Glenn%20Close">Glenn Close</a> as Nellie, <a href="Harry%20Connick%2C%20Jr.">Harry Connick, Jr.</a> as Cable and <a href="Rade%20Sherbedgia">Rade Sherbedgia</a> as Emile. This version changed the order of the musical's songs (the film opens with "There Is Nothing Like a Dame") and omits "Happy Talk". "My Girl Back Home" was filmed but not included in the broadcast due to time constraints; it was restored for the DVD, issued in 2001. The last half-hour of the film features scenes of war, including shots of segregated troops. Lovensheimer states that the film returned to the Michener original in one particular: "Harry Connick Jr.'s Joe Cable is a fascinating combination of sensitive leading man and believable Leatherneck".
The movie and Close were praised by "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>": "Ms. Close, lean and more mature, hints that a touch of desperation lies in Nellie's cockeyed optimism." The review also commented that the movie "is beautifully produced, better than the stagy 1958 film" and praised the singing. Kenrick, however, dislikes the adaptation: "You certainly won't ever want to put this disaster in your player, unless you want to hear the sound of Rodgers and Hammerstein whirling in their graves. Glenn Close is up to the material, but her supporting cast is uniformly disastrous. A pointless and offensive waste of money, time and talent."

A 2005 concert version of the musical, edited down to two hours, but including all of the songs and the full musical score, was presented at <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a>. It starred <a href="Reba%20McEntire">Reba McEntire</a> as Nellie, <a href="Brian%20Stokes%20Mitchell">Brian Stokes Mitchell</a> as Emile, <a href="Alec%20Baldwin">Alec Baldwin</a> as Billis and <a href="Lillias%20White">Lillias White</a> as Bloody Mary. The production used <a href="Robert%20Russell%20Bennett">Robert Russell Bennett</a>'s original orchestrations and the <a href="Orchestra%20of%20St.%20Luke%27s">Orchestra of St. Luke's</a> directed by <a href="Paul%20Gemignani">Paul Gemignani</a>. It was taped and telecast by <a href="PBS">PBS</a> in 2006 and released the same year on DVD. "The New York Times" critic <a href="Ben%20Brantley">Ben Brantley</a> wrote, "Open-voiced and open-faced, Reba McEntire was born to play Nellie"; the production was received "in a state of nearly unconditional rapture. It was one of those nights when cynicism didn't stand a chance." Kenrick especially likes Mitchell's "This Nearly Was Mine", and praises the concert generally: "this excellent performance helped restore the reputation of this classic".

Antiochus X Eusebes

Antiochus X Eusebes Philopator (; –92 or 88 BC) was a <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic</a> <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid</a> monarch who reigned as the <a href="List%20of%20Syrian%20monarchs">King of Syria</a> between 95 and 92 or 89/88 BC (224 <a href="Seleucid%20era">Seleucid year (SE)</a>). He was the son of <a href="Antiochus%20IX%20Cyzicenus">Antiochus IX</a> and perhaps his Egyptian wife <a href="Cleopatra%20IV%20of%20Egypt">Cleopatra IV</a>. He lived at a period that witnessed a general disintegration of Seleucid Syria characterized by civil wars, foreign interference by <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic</a> Egypt and incursions by the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthians</a>. Antiochus IX was killed in 95BC at the hands of <a href="Seleucus%20VI%20Epiphanes">Seleucus VI</a>, the son of his half-brother and rival <a href="Antiochus%20VIII%20Grypus">Antiochus VIII</a>. Antiochus X then went to the city of <a href="Arwad">Aradus</a> where he declared himself king. He avenged his father by defeating Seleucus VI, who was eventually killed.

Antiochus X did not enjoy a stable reign as he had to face three of Seleucus VI's brothers, <a href="Antiochus%20XI%20Epiphanes">Antiochus XI</a>, <a href="Philip%20I%20Philadelphus">Philip I</a> and <a href="Demetrius%20III%20Eucaerus">Demetrius III</a>. Antiochus XI defeated Antiochus X and expelled him from the capital <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> in 93 BC. Few months later, Antiochus X regained his position and killed Antiochus XI. This led to the interference of Philip I and Demetrius III. The civil war continued but its final outcome is uncertain due to the contradictions of ancient historians' accounts. Antiochus X married his stepmother, Antiochus IX's widow <a href="Cleopatra%20Selene%20of%20Syria">Cleopatra Selene</a>, and had several children with her, including later king <a href="Antiochus%20XIII%20Asiaticus">Antiochus XIII</a>.

The death of Antiochus X is shrouded in mystery. The year of his demise is traditionally given by modern scholars as 92 BC, but other dates are also possible including the year 224 SE (89/88BC). The most reliable account of his end is that of the first century historian <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a>, who wrote that Antiochus X marched east to fight off the Parthians when they attacked a queen called <a href="Laodice%20of%20the%20Sameans">Laodice</a>; the identity of this queen and who her people were are debated. Other accounts exist: the ancient Greek historian <a href="Appian">Appian</a> has Antiochus X defeated by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Armenia%20%28antiquity%29">Armenian</a> king <a href="Tigranes%20the%20Great">Tigranes II</a> and losing his kingdom; the third century historian <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a> wrote that Antiochus X was defeated by his cousins and escaped to the Parthians before asking the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Romans</a> to be reinstated on the throne. Modern scholars prefer the account of Josephus and question practically every aspect of the versions presented by other ancient historians. Numismatic evidence shows that Antiochus X was succeeded in Antioch by Demetrius III, who controlled the capital SE (88/87 BC).

The second century BC witnessed the disintegration of the Syria-based <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a> due to never-ending dynastic feuds and foreign <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Egyptian</a> and <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman</a> interference. Amid constant civil wars, Syria fell to pieces. Seleucid pretenders fought for the throne, tearing the country apart. In 113 BC, <a href="Antiochus%20IX%20Cyzicenus">Antiochus IX</a> declared himself king in opposition to his half-brother <a href="Antiochus%20VIII%20Grypus">Antiochus VIII</a>. The siblings fought relentlessly for a decade and a half until Antiochus VIII was killed in 96 BC. The following year, Antiochus VIII's son <a href="Seleucus%20VI%20Epiphanes">Seleucus VI</a> marched against Antiochus IX and killed him near the Syrian capital <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>.

Egypt and Syria attempted dynastic marriages to maintain a degree of peace. Antiochus IX married several times; known wives are his cousin <a href="Cleopatra%20IV%20of%20Egypt">Cleopatra IV of Egypt</a>, whom he married in 114 BC, and her sister <a href="Cleopatra%20Selene%20of%20Syria">Cleopatra Selene</a>, the widow of Antiochus VIII. Some historians, such as John D. Grainger, maintain the existence of a first wife unknown by name who was the mother of Antiochus X. Others, such as <a href="Auguste%20Bouch%C3%A9-Leclercq">Auguste Bouché-Leclercq</a>, believe that the first wife of Antiochus IX and the mother of his son was Cleopatra IV, in which case Antiochus X would have been born in . None of those assertions are based on evidence, and the mother of Antiochus X is not named in ancient sources. Antiochus is a Greek name meaning "resolute in contention". The capital Antioch received its name in deference to <a href="Antiochus%20%28father%20of%20Seleucus%20I%20Nicator%29">Antiochus</a>, the father of the Seleucid dynasty's founder <a href="Seleucus%20I%20Nicator">Seleucus I</a>; the name became dynastic and many Seleucid kings bore it.

According to <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a>, following the death of his father, Antiochus X went to the city of <a href="Arwad">Aradus</a> where he declared himself king; it is possible that Antiochus IX, before facing Seleucus VI, sent his son to that city for protection. Aradus was an independent city since 137 BC, meaning that Antiochus X made an alliance with it, since he would not have been able to subdue it by force at that stage of his reign. As the lines of Antiochus VIII and Antiochus IX fought over Syria, the descendants of each king portrayed themselves in the likeness of their respective fathers to indicate their legitimacy; Antiochus X's busts on his coins showed him with a short nose that ends with an up-turn, like his father. Ancient <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic</a> kings did not use <a href="regnal%20number">regnal number</a>s. Instead, they usually employed epithets to distinguish themselves from other rulers with similar names; the numbering of kings is mostly a modern practice. On his coins, Antiochus X appeared with the epithets "Eusebes" (the pious) and "Philopator" (father-loving). According to <a href="Appian">Appian</a>, the king received the epithet Eusebes from the Syrians because he escaped a plot on his life by Seleucus VI, and, officially, the Syrians thought that he survived because of his piety, but, in reality, it was a prostitute in love with Antiochus X who saved him.

Beginning his reign in 218 SE (95/94 BC), Antiochus X was deprived of resources and lacked a queen. He therefore married a woman who could provide what he needed, his stepmother Cleopatra Selene. Antiochus X was probably no more than twenty years old while his wife was in her forties. This union was not unprecedented in the Seleucid dynasty, as <a href="Antiochus%20I%20Soter">Antiochus I</a> had married his stepmother <a href="Stratonice%20of%20Syria">Stratonice</a>, but nevertheless, the marriage was scandalous. Appian commented that he thought the real reason behind the epithet "Eusebes" to be a joke by the Syrians, mocking Antiochus X's piety, as he showed loyalty to his father by bedding his widow. Appian concluded that it was "divine vengeance" for his marriage that eventually led to Antiochus X's fall.

One of Antiochus X's first actions was to avenge his father; in 94 BC, he advanced on the capital Antioch and drove Seleucus VI out of northern Syria into <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>. According to Eusebius, the final battle between Antiochus X and Seleucus VI took place near the Cilician city of <a href="Mopsuestia">Mopsuestia</a>, ending in Antiochus X's victory while Seleucus VI took refuge in the city where he perished as a result of a popular revolt.

During the Seleucid period, currency struck in times of campaigns against a rival or a usurper showed the king bearded, and what seems to be the earliest bronze coinage of Antiochus X shows him with a curly beard, while later currency, apparently meant to show the king in firm control of his realm, depicted Antiochus X clean shaven. Early in 93 BC, the brothers of Seleucus VI, <a href="Antiochus%20XI%20Epiphanes">Antiochus XI</a> and <a href="Philip%20I%20Philadelphus">Philip I</a>, avenged Seleucus VI by sacking Mopsuestia. Antiochus XI then advanced on Antioch, defeated Antiochus X, and expelled him from the city, reigning alone in the capital for few months.

Antiochus X recruited new soldiers and attacked Antioch the same year. He emerged victorious, while Antiochus XI drowned in the <a href="Orontes%20River">Orontes River</a> as he tried to flee. Now Antiochus X ruled northern Syria and Cilicia; around this time, Mopsuestia minted coins with the word "autonomous" inscribed. This new political status seems to have been a privilege bestowed upon the city by Antiochus X, who, as a sign of gratitude for Mopsuestia's role in eliminating Seleucus VI, apparently not just rebuilt it, but also compensated it for the damage it suffered at the hands of Seleucus VI's brothers. In the view of the numismatist , some coins minted in Mopsuestia may carry a portrait of Antiochus X. Other cities minted their own civic coinage under the king's rule, including <a href="Tripoli%2C%20Lebanon">Tripolis</a>, <a href="Beirut">Berytus</a>, and perhaps the autonomous city of <a href="Ashkelon">Ascalon</a>.

In the capital, Antiochus X might have been responsible for building a library and an attached museum on the model of the <a href="Library%20of%20Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a>. Philip I was probably centered at <a href="Aleppo">Beroea</a>; his brother, <a href="Demetrius%20III%20Eucaerus">Demetrius III</a>, who ruled <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>, supported him and marched north probably in the spring of 93 BC. Antiochus X faced fierce resistance from his cousins. In the year 220 SE (93/92BC), the city of Damascus stopped issuing coins in the name of Demetrius III, then resumed the following year; this could have been the result of incursions by Antiochus X, which weakened his cousin and made Damascus vulnerable to attacks by the <a href="Judea">Judaean</a> king <a href="Alexander%20Jannaeus">Alexander Jannaeus</a>.

The Roman statesman <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> wrote about two sons of Antiochus X and Cleopatra Selene who visited <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a> during his time (between 75 and 73 BC); one of them was named Antiochus. The king might have also fathered a daughter with his wife; according to the first century historian <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Armenia%20%28antiquity%29">Armenian</a> king <a href="Tigranes%20the%20Great">Tigranes II</a>, who killed Cleopatra Selene in 69 BC, "put to death the successors of <a href="Seleucus%20I%20Nicator">Seleucus</a>, and [carried] off their wives and daughters into captivity". This statement makes it possible to assume that Antiochus X had at least one daughter with his wife.

Information about Antiochus X after the interference of Demetrius III is scanty. Ancient sources and modern scholars present different accounts and dates for the demise of the king. Antiochus X's end as told by Josephus, which has the king killed during a campaign against the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthians</a>, is considered the most reliable and likely by modern historians. The majority of scholars accept the year 92 BC for Antiochus X's end:

No known coins issued by the king in Antioch contain a date. Josephus wrote that the king fell soon after Demetrius III's interference, but this statement is vague. Most scholars, such as <a href="Edward%20Theodore%20Newell">Edward Theodore Newell</a>, understood Josephus' statement to indicate 92BC. According to Hoover, the dating of Newell is apparently based on combining the statement of Josephus with that of Eusebius, who wrote that Antiochus X was ejected from the capital in 220 SE (93/92 BC) by Philip I. Hoover considered Newell's dating hard to accept; a market weight from Antioch bearing Antiochus X's name, from 92 BC, might contradict the dating of 220 SE (93/92 BC). On the other hand, in the year 221 SE (92/91BC), the city of Antioch issued civic coinage mentioning no king; Hoover noted that the civic coinage mentions Antioch as the "metropolis" but not as autonomous, and this might be explained as a reward from Antiochus X bestowed upon the city for supporting him in his struggle against his cousins.

In 2007, using a methodology based on estimating the annual <a href="Coining%20%28mint%29%23Ancient%20coin%20dies">die</a> usage average rate (the Esty formula), Hoover proposed the year 224 SE (89/88 BC) for the end of Antiochus X's reign. Later in 2011, Hoover noted that this date is hard to accept considering that during Antiochus X's second reign in the capital, only one or two dies were used per year, far too few for the Seleucid average rate to justify a long reign. Hoover then noted that there seem to be several indications that the coinage of Antiochus X's second reign in the capital, along with the coinages of Antiochus XI and Demetrius III, were re-coined by Philip I who eventually took Antioch , thus explaining the rarity of those kings' coins. Hoover admitted that his conclusion is "troubling". The historian considered Hoover's dating and arguments too speculative, as they contradict ancient literature.

The manner of the king's death varies depending on which ancient account is used. The main ancient historians providing information on Antiochus X's end are Josephus, Appian, Eusebius and Saint <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a>:

The account of Josephus: "For when he was come as an auxiliary to <a href="Laodice%20of%20the%20Sameans">Laodice</a>, queen of the Gileadites, when she was making war against the Parthians, and he was fighting courageously, he fell." The Parthians might have been allied with Philip I. The people of Laodice, their location, and who she was are hard to determine, as surviving manuscripts of Josephus' work transmit different names for the people. Gileadites is an older designation based on the Codex Leidensis (Lugdunensis) manuscript of Josephus' work, but the academic consensus <a href="Laodice%20of%20the%20Sameans%23The%20name%20of%20the%20tribe">uses the designation Sameans</a>, based on the "Codex Palatinus (Vaticanus) Graecus" manuscript.


The account of Appian: Antiochus X was expelled from Syria by Tigranes II of Armenia. Appian gave Tigranes II a reign of fourteen years in Syria ending in 69 BC. That year witnessed the retreat of the Armenian king due to a war with the Romans. Hence, the invasion of Syria by Tigranes, based on the account of Appian, probably took place in 83 BC. Bellinger dismissed this account, and considered that Appian confused Antiochus X with his son Antiochus XIII. Kuhn considered a confusion between father and son to be out of the question because Appian mentioned the epithet Eusebes when talking about the fate of Antiochus X. In the view of Kuhn, Antiochus X retreated to Cilicia after being defeated by Tigranes II, and his sons ruled that region after him and were reported visiting Rome in 73 BC. However, numismatic evidence proves that Demetrius III controlled Cilicia following the demise of Antiochus X, and that <a href="Tarsus%2C%20Mersin">Tarsus</a> minted coins in his name SE (88/87 BC). The Egyptologist <a href="The%20Egyptian%20Royal%20Genealogy%20Project">Christopher J. Bennett</a>, considered it possible that Antiochus X retreated to <a href="Ptolemais%20in%20Phoenicia">Ptolemais</a> after being defeated by Tigranes since it became his widow's base. In his history, Appian failed to mention the reigns of Demetrius III and Philip I in the capital which preceded the reign of Tigranes II. According to Hoover, Appian's ignorance of the intervening kings between Antiochus X and Tigranes II might explain how he confused Antiochus XIII, who is known to have fled from the Armenian king, with his father.

Eusebius and others: According to Eusebius, who used the account of the third century historian <a href="Porphyry%20%28philosopher%29">Porphyry</a>, Antiochus X was ejected from the capital by Philip I in 220 SE (93/92 BC) and fled to the Parthians. Eusebius added that following the Roman conquest of Syria, Antiochus X surrendered to <a href="Pompey">Pompey</a>, hoping to be reinstated on the throne, but the people of Antioch paid money to the Roman general to avoid a Seleucid restoration. Antiochus X was then invited by the people of <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> to rule jointly with the daughters of <a href="Ptolemy%20XII%20Auletes">Ptolemy XII</a>, but he died of illness soon after. This account has been questioned by many scholars, such as Hoover and Bellinger. The story told by Eusebius contains factual inaccuracies, as he wrote that in the same year Antiochus X was defeated by Philip I, he surrendered to Pompey, while at the same time Philip I was captured by the governor of Syria <a href="Aulus%20Gabinius">Aulus Gabinius</a>. However, Pompey arrived in Syria only in 64 BC, and left it in 62 BC. Aulus Gabinius was appointed governor of Syria in 57 BC. Also, the part of Eusebius' account regarding the surrender to Pompey echoes the fate of Antiochus XIII; the writer seems to be confusing the fate of Antiochus X with that of his son. The second century historian <a href="Justin%20%28historian%29">Justin</a>, writing based on the work of the first century BC historian <a href="Gnaeus%20Pompeius%20Trogus">Trogus</a>, also confused the father and son, as he wrote that Antiochus X was appointed king of Syria by the Roman general <a href="Lucullus">Lucullus</a> following the defeat of Tigranes II in 69 BC.

It is known from numismatic evidence that Demetrius III eventually succeeded Antiochus X in Antioch. Eusebius' statement that Antiochus X was ejected from the capital by Philip I in 220 SE (93/92 BC) is contradicted by the coins of Demetrius III, who was not mentioned at all by Eusebius. Any suggestions that Philip I controlled Antioch before the demise of Demetrius III can be dismissed; in addition to the numismatic evidence, no ancient source claimed that Demetrius III had to push Philip I out of the city.

In 1949, a jugate coin of Cleopatra Selene and Antiochus XIII, from the collection of the French archaeologist <a href="Henri%20Arnold%20Seyrig">Henri Arnold Seyrig</a>, was dated by the historian <a href="Alfred%20Bellinger">Alfred Bellinger</a> to 92BC and ascribed to Antioch. Based on Bellinger's dating, some modern historians, such as Ehling, proposed that Cleopatra Selene enjoyed an ephemeral reign in Antioch between the death of her husband and the arrival of his successor. Bellinger doubted his own dating and the coin's place of issue in 1952, suggesting Cilicia instead of Antioch. This coin is dated by many twenty-first century scholars to 82BC.

Philip I Philadelphus

Philip I Epiphanes Philadelphus (; between 125 and 109 BC – 83 or 75 BC) was a <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic</a> <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid</a> monarch who reigned as the <a href="List%20of%20Syrian%20monarchs">King of Syria</a> from 94 to either 83 or 75 BC. The son of <a href="Antiochus%20VIII%20Grypus">Antiochus VIII</a> and his wife <a href="Tryphaena">Tryphaena</a>, he spent his early life in a period of civil war between his father and his uncle <a href="Antiochus%20IX%20Cyzicenus">Antiochus IX</a>. The conflict ended with the assassination of Antiochus VIII and a quick succession in the Syrian capital <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> of Antiochus IX then Antiochus VIII's eldest son <a href="Seleucus%20VI%20Epiphanes">Seleucus VI</a>.

After the murder of Seleucus VI in 94 BC, Philip I became king with his twin brother <a href="Antiochus%20XI%20Epiphanes">Antiochus XI</a>, and planned to avenge Seleucus VI. In 93 BC Antiochus XI took Antioch from Antiochus IX's son <a href="Antiochus%20X%20Eusebes">Antiochus X</a>. Antiochus XI became the senior king, and Philip I remained in a base in <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>. Antiochus X returned and killed Antiochus XI that year. Philip I then allied with his younger brother <a href="Demetrius%20III%20Eucaerus">Demetrius III</a>, who was based in <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>. Antiochus X was probably killed in 88 BC. Demetrius III took the capital and besieged Philip I in <a href="Aleppo">Beroea</a> (Aleppo), but the latter prevailed and took Antioch; their youngest brother <a href="Antiochus%20XII%20Dionysus">Antiochus XII</a> took Damascus. 

Philip I tried unsuccessfully to take Damascus for himself, after which he disappears from the historical record; there is no information about when or how he died. The Antiochenes, apparently refusing to accept Philip I's minor son <a href="Philip%20II%20Philoromaeus">Philip II</a> as his successor, invited <a href="Tigranes%20the%20Great">Tigranes II</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Armenia%20%28antiquity%29">Armenia</a> to take the city. While the invasion of Tigranes II is traditionally dated to 83 BC, the year most scholars agree on for Philip I's death, the conflict may have taken place in 74 BC. Numismatic evidence and clues in ancient contemporary literature indicate that Philip I might have died in 75 BC, giving Antiochus X's widow <a href="Cleopatra%20Selene%20of%20Syria">Cleopatra Selene</a> and her son <a href="Antiochus%20XIII%20Asiaticus">Antiochus XIII</a>, who probably took control of the south following the death of Antiochus XII in 82 BC, a year of claiming the whole kingdom. Philip I initiated monetary reforms, and his coins remained in circulation until the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Romans</a> conquered Syria in 64 BC; Roman authorities in Syria continued to issue coins modeled on Philip I's coins, including his portrait, until 13 BC.

The <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid dynasty</a> which ruled Syria following the death of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> was plagued by dynastic feuds during the 2nd century BC, exacerbated by <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic</a> and <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman</a> interference. <a href="Dynastic%20marriage">Dynastic marriage</a> was used to maintain a degree of peace between Ptolemaic Egypt and Syria; Ptolemaic princess <a href="Cleopatra%20Thea">Cleopatra Thea</a> became the consort of three successive Syrian kings in 150, 145 and 138 BC. Syria gradually disintegrated due to constant civil wars, as the Seleucid kings and their heirs fought for power, tearing the country apart. This lasted until about 123 BC, when <a href="Antiochus%20VIII%20Grypus">Antiochus VIII</a> provided a degree of stability which lasted for a decade until his brother <a href="Antiochus%20IX%20Cyzicenus">Antiochus IX</a> declared himself king. 

With his Ptolemaic wife <a href="Tryphaena">Tryphaena</a>, whom he married in 125 BC, Antiochus VIII fathered five sons: <a href="Seleucus%20VI%20Epiphanes">Seleucus VI</a>, the eldest; <a href="Antiochus%20XI%20Epiphanes">Antiochus XI</a> and Philip I, who were apparently twins; their younger brother, <a href="Demetrius%20III%20Eucaerus">Demetrius III</a>; and the youngest, <a href="Antiochus%20XII%20Dionysus">Antiochus XII</a>. The name Philip (Greek "Phílippos") means "lover of horses". Seleucid kings were mostly named Seleucus and Antiochus; "Philip" was used by the <a href="Antigonid%20dynasty">Antigonid dynasty</a> as a royal name, and its use by the Seleucids, who were descended from the Antigonids through queen <a href="Stratonice%20of%20Syria">Stratonice</a>, was probably meant to signify that they were heirs of the latter. The war with Antiochus IX claimed Tryphaena's life in 109 BC. Following Antiochus VIII's assassination in 96 BC, his second wife, Tryphaena's sister <a href="Cleopatra%20Selene%20of%20Syria">Cleopatra Selene</a>, married Antiochus IX, who took Antioch. Antiochus VIII's sons did not submit to their uncle; Seleucus VI took Antioch in 95 BC after killing Antiochus IX, while Demetrius III seized and ruled <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>. Antiochus IX's son <a href="Antiochus%20X%20Eusebes">Antiochus X</a> married Cleopatra Selene and defeated Seleucus VI, who escaped to <a href="Mopsuestia">Mopsuestia</a>, where he was killed by rebels in 94 BC.

Philip I and Antiochus XI probably resided in Cilicia during Seleucus VI's reign. In 94 BC, shortly after their brother's death, Philip I and Antiochus XI minted <a href="jugate">jugate</a> coins with their portraits on the obverse. The historian <a href="Alfred%20Bellinger">Alfred Bellinger</a> suggested that their base of operations was a coastal city north of Antioch, but according to the numismatist Arthur Houghton, <a href="Aleppo">Beroea</a> is a stronger candidate because the city's rulers were Philip I's allies. All the jugate coins were minted in Cilicia; the series with the most numerous surviving specimens was probably issued in <a href="Tarsus%2C%20Mersin">Tarsus</a>, making it the likely base of operations. Antiochus XI was portrayed in front of his brother, indicating that he was the senior king. Deriving their legitimacy from Antiochus VIII, the brothers were depicted on the coins with exaggerated <a href="aquiline%20nose">aquiline nose</a>s similar to their father. <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic</a> kings did not use <a href="regnal%20number">regnal number</a>s, which is a modern practise; instead, they used epithets to distinguish themselves from similarly named monarchs. On his coins, Philip I used the epithets Philadelphus (sibling-loving) and Epiphanes (the glorious, or illustrious). The brothers intended to avenge Seleucus VI; according to the fourth century writer <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>, they sacked Mopsuestia and destroyed it. 

While Philip I remained in Cilicia, Antiochus XI advanced on Antioch and drove Antiochus X from the city in the beginning of 93 BC. Philip I did not live in the Syrian metropolis and left Antiochus XI as master of the capital. By autumn 93 BC, Antiochus X regrouped and defeated Antiochus XI, who drowned in the <a href="Orontes%20River">Orontes</a>. The first century historian <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a> mentioned only Antiochus XI in the battle, but Eusebius wrote that Philip I was also present. Bellinger believed that Philip I's troops participated, but that he remained behind at his base, since only Antiochus XI was killed. Following the defeat, Philip I is thought to have retreated to his capital, which was probably the same base from which he and his brother operated when they first prepared to avenge Seleucus VI.

Demetrius III may have marched north to support Antiochus XI in the battle of 93 BC, and he certainly supported Philip I in the struggle against Antiochus X. Eusebius wrote that Philip I defeated Antiochus X and replaced him in the capital in 93/92 BC (220 <a href="Seleucid%20era">Seleucid year (SE)</a>). However, Eusebius does not note the reign of Antiochus XI or mention Demetrius III. The account contradicts archaeological evidence, represented in a market weight belonging to Antiochus X from 92 BC, and contains factual mistakes. The English minister and numismatist Edgar Rogers believed that Philip I ruled Antioch immediately after Antiochus XI, but suggestions that Philip I controlled Antioch before the demise of Antiochus X and Demetrius III can be dismissed; they contradict the numismatic evidence, and no ancient source claimed that Demetrius III, who actually succeeded Antiochus X in Antioch, had to push Philip I out of the city. 

In any case, Antiochus X disappeared from the record after 92 BC, but could have remained in power until 224 SE (89/88 BC); he probably died fighting against <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthia</a>. Taking advantage of Antiochus X's death, Demetrius III rushed to the capital and occupied it; this led Philip I to break his alliance with his brother. With most of Syria in the hands of Demetrius III, Philip I retreated to his base. In 88 BC, Demetrius III marched on Beroea for the final battle with Philip I. To raise the siege, Philip I's ally Straton, the ruler of Beroea, called on the Arab <a href="phylarch">phylarch</a> Aziz and the Parthian governor Mithridates Sinaces for help. The allies defeated Demetrius III, who was sent into captivity in Parthia. Any captive who was a citizen of Antioch was released without a ransom, a gesture which must have eased Philip I's occupation of Antioch.

Shortly after the battle, in late 88 BC or early 87 BC, Philip I entered the Syrian capital, and had Cilicia under his authority. He was faced with the need to replenish the empty treasury to rebuild a country destroyed after years of civil war, and in case a new pretender to the throne arose. Those factors, combined with the low estimates of annual <a href="Coining%20%28mint%29%23Ancient%20coin%20dies">coin dies</a> used by Philip I's immediate predecessors in Antioch—Antiochus X (his second reign) and Demetrius III—compared with the general die estimates of late Seleucid kings, led numismatist <a href="Oliver%20D.%20Hoover">Oliver D. Hoover</a> to propose that Philip I simply re-coined his predecessors' coins and skewed their dies. This resulted in currency bearing Philip I's image, reduced in weight from the standard to . This yielded a profit of half an <a href="Obol%20%28coin%29">obol</a> on each older coin which was re-struck. Profit was, however, not the main aim of Philip I; it is more probable that he wanted to pay his troops with coins bearing his own image instead of that of his rivals. The recoinage was also necessary since Philip I's coins were reduced in weight and the king needed to enforce the use of his currency by removing his rivals' heavier coins out of circulation. Philip I may have adopted the New Seleucid era dating, which have the return of Antiochus VIII from his exile in <a href="Aspendos">Aspendos</a> in 200 SE (113/112 BC) as a starting point; the traditional Seleucid era started in 1 SE (312/311 BC).

Philip I's position on the throne was insecure: Cleopatra Selene hid in Syria with <a href="Antiochus%20XIII%20Asiaticus">Antiochus XIII</a>, her son by Antiochus X, waiting for an opportunity to regain the throne, while Antiochus XII replaced Demetrius III in Damascus, but there is no evidence that he sought to compete with his brother for Antioch. According to Josephus, Philip I took advantage of Antiochus XII's absence in a campaign against <a href="Nabataean%20Kingdom">Nabataea</a> to seize Damascus. The governor of the city—Milesius, who opened the gates for the Philip I—was not given a suitable reward by his new master, leading him to wait until Philip I left the city; he then closed the gates, locking the king out until Antiochus XII returned. In the Seleucid dynasty, currency struck during campaigns against a rival (or usurper) showed the king with a beard. Antiochus XII was shown beardless for the first two years of his reign; in 228 SE (85/84 BC), he appeared with a beard, possibly related to Philip I's attack on Damascus. But since Antiochus XII did not march north against his brother, the hypothesis about a connection between Antiochus XII' beard and Philip I's attempt to take Damascus weakens; no coins of Philip I were struck in Damascus, indicating that his occupation of the city was brief.

After the attack on Damascus, Philip I disappeared from ancient literature. Without proof, 83 BC is commonly accepted as Philip I's year of death by most scholars; he could have been buried in the Nikatoreion Mausoleum, <a href="Seleucia%20Pieria">Seleucia Pieria</a>. Traditionally, Philip I is considered by most scholars to have been succeeded by <a href="Tigranes%20the%20Great">Tigranes II</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Armenia%20%28antiquity%29">Armenia</a>, who was invited by the people of Antioch despite the existence of Philip I's probably-minor son <a href="Philip%20II%20Philoromaeus">Philip II</a>. The second century historian <a href="Appian">Appian</a> assigned a fourteen-year reign to Tigranes II which ended in 69 BC, and most scholars accepted the ancient historian's version, hence the date 83 BC. The fate of Philip I is a source of debate in academic circles, as no clues regarding how, where, and when his life ended exist. Many theories were presented by different historians: 



Philip I's coins were still in circulation when the Romans annexed Syria in 64 BC. The first Roman coins struck in Syria were copies of Philip I's coins, and bore his image with the monogram of the Roman governor. The first issue was in 57 BC under governor <a href="Aulus%20Gabinius">Aulus Gabinius</a>, and the last series of Philip I's posthumous coins was minted in 13 BC. The Romans may have considered Philip I the last legitimate Seleucid king, a theory held by Kevin Butcher and other scholars. Hoover opted for a simpler answer; Philip I's coins were the most numerous and earlier Seleucid coin models were destroyed, making it economically sensible for the Romans to continue Philip I's model. Anomalous coins of Philip, differing from his standard lifetime models but similar to the later Roman Philip coins, indicate that they might have been minted by the autonomous city of Antioch between 64 and 58 BC before governor Aulus Gabinius issued his Philipean coins, making it viable for the Romans to continue minting coins already being struck.

Seleucus VI Epiphanes

Seleucus VI Epiphanes Nicator (; between 125 and 109 BC – 94BC) was a <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic</a> <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid</a> monarch who <a href="List%20of%20Syrian%20monarchs">ruled Syria</a> between 96 and 94 BC. He was the son of <a href="Antiochus%20VIII%20Grypus">Antiochus VIII</a> and his Egyptian wife <a href="Tryphaena">Tryphaena</a>. Seleucus VI lived in a period of civil war between his father and his uncle <a href="Antiochus%20IX%20Cyzicenus">Antiochus IX</a>, which ended in 96 BC when Antiochus VIII was assassinated. Antiochus IX then occupied the capital <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> while Seleucus VI established his power-base in western <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a> and himself prepared for war. In 95 BC, Antiochus IX marched against his nephew, but lost the battle and was killed. Seleucus VI became the master of the capital but had to share Syria with his brother <a href="Demetrius%20III%20Eucaerus">Demetrius III</a>, based in <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>, and his cousin, Antiochus IX's son <a href="Antiochus%20X%20Eusebes">Antiochus X</a>.

According to the ancient historian <a href="Appian">Appian</a>, Seleucus VI was a violent ruler. He taxed his dominions extensively to support his wars, and resisted allowing the cities a measure of autonomy, as had been the practice of former kings. His reign did not last long; in 94 BC, he was expelled from Antioch by Antiochus X, who followed him to the Cilician city of <a href="Mopsuestia">Mopsuestia</a>. Seleucus took shelter in the city where his attempts to raise money led to riots that eventually claimed his life in 94 BC. Ancient traditions have different versions of his death, but he was most probably burned alive by the rioters. Following his demise, his brothers <a href="Antiochus%20XI%20Epiphanes">Antiochus XI</a> and <a href="Philip%20I%20Philadelphus">Philip I</a> destroyed Mopsuestia as an act of revenge and their armies fought those of Antiochus X.

"Seleucus" was a dynastic name in the <a href="List%20of%20Seleucid%20rulers">Seleucid dynasty</a>, and it is the <a href="Ancient%20Macedonian%20language">Macedonian</a> variant of the Greek Ζάλευκος (zaleucus), meaning the shining white. <a href="Antiochus%20VIII%20Grypus">Antiochus VIII</a> married the <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic</a> Egyptian princess <a href="Tryphaena">Tryphaena</a> in 125BC, shortly after his ascension to the throne; Seleucus VI was the couple's eldest son. From 113BC, Antiochus VIII had to contend with his half-brother <a href="Antiochus%20IX%20Cyzicenus">Antiochus IX</a> for the throne. The civil war continued for more than a decade; it claimed the life of Tryphaena in 109 BC, and ended when Antiochus VIII was assassinated in 96BC. In the aftermath of his brother's murder, Antiochus IX advanced on the capital <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> and took it; he also married the second wife and widow of Antiochus VIII, <a href="Cleopatra%20Selene%20of%20Syria">Cleopatra Selene</a>. According to an inscription, the city of <a href="Priene">Priene</a> sent honors to "Seleucus son of King Antiochus son of King <a href="Demetrius%20II%20Nicator">Demetrius</a>"; the embassy probably took place before Seleucus VI ascended the throne as the inscription does not mention him as a king. The embassy of Priene probably met Seleucus VI in <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>; Antiochus VIII might have sent his son to that region as a <a href="strategos">strategos</a>.

Following his father's death, Seleucus VI declared himself king and took the city of <a href="Silifke">Seleucia on the Calycadnus</a> in western Cilicia as his base, while his brother <a href="Demetrius%20III%20Eucaerus">Demetrius III</a> took <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>. The volume of coins minted by the new king in Seleucia on the Calycadnus surpassed any other mint known from the late Seleucid period, and most of the coins were produced during his preparations for war against Antiochus IX, a conflict that would end in the year 96/95 BC (217 <a href="Seleucid%20era">Seleucid year (SE)</a>). This led the numismatist Arthur Houghton to suggest an earlier death for Antiochus VIII and a longer reign for Seleucus VI beginning in 98 or 97BC instead of 96BC. The numismatist <a href="Oliver%20D.%20Hoover">Oliver D. Hoover</a> contested Houghton's hypothesis as it was not rare for a king to double his production in a single year at times of need, and the academic consensus prefers the year 96BC for the death of Antiochus VIII.

Ancient <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic</a> kings did not use <a href="regnal%20number">regnal number</a>s. Instead, they employed epithets to distinguish themselves from other kings with similar names; the numbering of kings is a modern practice. Seleucus VI appeared on his coins with the epithets "Epiphanes" (God Manifest) and "Nicator" (Victorious). As being the son of Antiochus VIII was the source of his legitimacy as king, Seleucus VI sought to emphasize his descent by depicting himself on the coinage with an exaggerated hawk-nose in the likeness of his father. 

Another iconographic element of Seleucus VI's coinage is the short vertical stubby horns above the <a href="Temple%20%28anatomy%29">temple</a> area; the meaning of this motif has been debated among scholars. It is likely an allusion to Seleucus VI's descent from his grandfather <a href="Demetrius%20II%20Nicator">Demetrius II</a>, who utilized the same motif. The specific meaning of the horns is not clear, but it could have been an indication that the king was a manifestation of a god; the stubby horns sported by Seleucus VI probably carried the same meaning as those of his grandfather. In the Seleucid dynasty, currency struck during campaigns against a rival (or usurper) showed the king with a beard. Seleucus VI was depicted with a beard, which was later removed from coins, indicating the fulfilment of a vengeance vow to avenge his father.

In Seleucia on the Calycadnus, Seleucus VI prepared for war against his uncle, whose forces probably occupied central Cilicia and confined his nephew to the western parts of the region. The king needed a harbor for Seleucia on the Calycadnus and probably founded the city of <a href="Elaiussa%20Sebaste">Elaiussa</a> to serve that purpose. Seleucus VI gathered funds for his coming war from the cities of Cilicia, including <a href="Mopsuestia">Mopsuestia</a>, which seems to have been taxed on several occasions. During his reign, it is estimated that Seleucus VI produced 1,200 <a href="Talent%20%28measurement%29">talents</a> of coins to support his war effort, enough to pay ten thousand soldiers for two years. On the reverse of bronze coins produced in a mint whose location is not known, coded uncertain mint 125, a motif depicting a <a href="chelys">chelys</a> formed in the shape of a Macedonian shield appeared on the reverse. This motif was probably meant to rally the support of military Macedonian colonists in the region. Those coins were probably produced in Syria, in a city half the way between <a href="Tarsus%2C%20Mersin">Tarsus</a> in Cilicia and Antioch; therefore, they were probably minted in the course of Seleucus VI's campaign against Antiochus IX.

Antiochus IX took note of Seleucus VI's preparations; after the latter started his march on Antioch in 95BC, Antiochus IX left the capital and moved against his nephew. Seleucus VI emerged victorious while his uncle lost his life, either by committing suicide according to the third century historian <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>, or by being executed according to the first century historian <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a>. Soon afterwards, Seleucus VI entered the capital; Cleopatra Selene probably fled before his arrival.

In 144 SE (169/168 BC), King <a href="Antiochus%20IV%20Epiphanes">Antiochus IV</a> allowed nineteen cities to mint municipal bronze coinage in their own names, indicating his awareness of the mutual dependency of cities and the monarchy on each other. This movement towards greater autonomy continued as the cities sought to emancipate themselves from the central power, adding the phrase "sacred and autonomous" to their coinage. Seleucus VI did not follow the policy of his forebears. In Cilicia, as long as he reigned, autonomy was not granted; a change in the political status of Cilician cities was apparently not acceptable for Seleucus VI. 

Seleucus IV controlled Cilicia and Syria Seleucis (Northern Syria). Antiochus IX had a son, <a href="Antiochus%20X%20Eusebes">Antiochus X</a>; according to Josephus, he fled to the city of <a href="Arwad">Aradus</a> where he declared himself king. Seleucus VI attempted to kill his cousin and rival but the plot failed, and Antiochus X married Cleopatra Selene to enhance his position. The archaeologist <a href="Alfred%20Bellinger">Alfred Bellinger</a> believed that Seleucus VI prepared for his coming war against Antiochus X in Elaiussa. In 94BC, Antiochus X advanced on the capital Antioch and drove Seleucus VI out of northern Syria into Cilicia. According to Eusebius, the final battle took place near Mopsuestia, and ended with the defeat of Seleucus VI.

Described by the second century historian <a href="Appian">Appian</a> as "violent and extremely tyrannical", Seleucus VI took shelter in Mopsuestia, and attempted to tax the residents again, which led to his death during riots. The year of his demise is not clear; Eusebius placed it in 216 SE (97/96 BC) which is impossible considering that a market weight of Seleucus VI from Antioch dated to 218 SE (95/94 BC) has been discovered. The fourth century historian <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> has 219 SE (94/93 BC) as the year of Seleucus VI's demise, which is more plausible. The year 94BC is the academically accepted date for the death of Seleucus VI. No spouse or children were recorded for Seleucus VI. According to the first century biographer <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, the first century BC <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman</a> general <a href="Lucullus">Lucullus</a> said that the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Armenia%20%28antiquity%29">Armenian</a> king, <a href="Tigranes%20the%20Great">Tigranes II</a>, who conquered Syria in 83BC, "put to death the successors of <a href="Seleucus%20I%20Nicator">Seleucus</a>, and [carried] off their wives and daughters into captivity". Given the fragmentary nature of ancient sources regarding the late-Seleucid period, the statement of Lucullus leaves open the existence of a wife or daughter of Seleucus VI.

Ancient traditions preserve three accounts regarding Seleucus VI's death: the oldest, by Josephus, has a mob burning the king and his courtiers in the royal palace. Appian shares the burning account but has the city's gymnasium as the scene. According to Eusebius, Seleucus VI discovered the intention of the residents to burn him, and took his own life. Bellinger considered the account of Josephus to be the most probable; he noted that Eusebius presented suicide accounts for other Seleucid kings who were recorded as having been killed by other historians, such as <a href="Alexander%20Balas">Alexander I</a> and Antiochus IX. Bellinger believed that the third century historian <a href="Porphyry%20%28philosopher%29">Porphyry</a>, the source of Eusebius' stories about the Seleucids, was attempting to "tone down somewhat the horrors of the Seleucid house".

The city of <a href="Athens">Athens</a> shared a close relation with the Seleucid kings, and statues of Syrian monarchs set up by Athenian citizens on the island of <a href="Delos">Delos</a> testify to that; a citizen named Dionysius dedicated a statue for Seleucus VI between 96 and 94BC. In deference to his late brother, King <a href="Antiochus%20XI%20Epiphanes">Antiochus XI</a> adopted the epithet "Philadelphus" (brother loving). Along with his twin <a href="Philip%20I%20Philadelphus">Philip I</a>, Antiochus XI proceeded to avenge Seleucus VI; the brothers sacked and destroyed Mopsuestia. Antiochus XI then headed to Antioch in 93BC and expelled Antiochus X.

H.D.

Hilda "H.D." Doolittle (September 10, 1886 – September 27, 1961) was an American poet, novelist, and memoirist, associated with the early 20th century avant-garde <a href="Imagism">Imagist</a> group of poets, including <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a> and <a href="Richard%20Aldington">Richard Aldington</a>. She published under the <a href="pen%20name">pen name</a> H.D.

Hilda was born in <a href="Bethlehem%2C%20Pennsylvania">Bethlehem, Pennsylvania</a> in 1886. She moved to London in 1911, where she played a central role within the then emerging Imagist movement. A charismatic figure, she was championed by the <a href="Modernist%20poetry%20in%20English">modernist poet</a> Ezra Pound, who was instrumental in building and furthering her career. From 1916–17, she acted as the literary editor of the "<a href="The%20Egoist%20%28periodical%29">Egoist</a>" journal, while her poetry appeared in the "<a href="English%20Review">English Review</a>" and the "<a href="The%20Transatlantic%20Review%20%281924%29">Transatlantic Review</a>". During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, H.D. suffered the death of her brother and the breakup of her marriage to the poet <a href="Richard%20Aldington">Richard Aldington</a>, and these events weighed heavily on her later poetry. Imagist authority Glenn Hughes wrote that 'her loneliness cries out from her poems'. She had a deep interest in <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20literature">Ancient Greek literature</a>, and her poetry often borrowed from <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> and classical poets. Her work is noted for its incorporation of natural scenes and objects, which are often used to emote a particular feeling or mood.

She befriended <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> during the 1930s, and became his patient in order to understand and express her <a href="bisexuality">bisexuality</a>, her residual war trauma, her writing, and her spiritual experiences. H.D. married once, and undertook a number of relationships with both men and women. She was unapologetic about her sexuality, and thus became an icon for both the <a href="LGBT%20rights%20movement">LGBT rights</a> and <a href="feminist%20movement">feminist movement</a>s when her poems, plays, letters and essays were rediscovered during the 1970s and 1980s.

H.D. was born into the Moravian community in <a href="Bethlehem%2C%20Pennsylvania">Bethlehem, Pennsylvania</a>. Her father, Charles Doolittle, was professor of astronomy at <a href="Lehigh%20University">Lehigh University</a> and her mother, Helen (Wolle), was a <a href="Moravian%20Church">Moravian</a> with a strong interest in music. H.D. was their only surviving daughter in a family of five sons. In 1896, Charles Doolittle was appointed Flower Professor of Astronomy at the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>, and the family moved to a house in <a href="Upper%20Darby%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Upper Darby</a>. She attended Philadelphia's <a href="Religious%20Society%20of%20Friends">Friends'</a> <a href="Friends%27%20Central%20School">Central High School</a>, at Fifteenth and Race streets, graduating in 1905. In 1901, she met and befriended Ezra Pound, who was to play a major role both in her private life and her emergence as a writer. In 1905, Pound presented her with a sheaf of love poems under the collective title "Hilda's Book".

That year, H.D. attended <a href="Bryn%20Mawr%20College">Bryn Mawr College</a> to study <a href="Greek%20literature">Greek literature</a>, but left after only three terms due to poor grades and the excuse of poor health. While at the college, she met poets <a href="Marianne%20Moore">Marianne Moore</a> and <a href="William%20Carlos%20Williams">William Carlos Williams</a>. Her first published writings, stories for children, were published in "The Comrade", a Philadelphia Presbyterian Church paper, between 1909 and 1913, mostly under the name Edith Gray. In 1907, she became engaged to Pound. Her father disapproved of her fiancé, and by the time Pound left for Europe in 1908, the engagement had been called off. Around this time, H.D. started a relationship with a young female art student at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Frances Josepha Gregg. After spending part of 1910 living in <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>, she sailed to Europe with Gregg and Gregg's mother in 1911. In Europe, H.D. began a more serious career as a writer. Her relationship with Gregg cooled, and she met a writing enthusiast named Brigit Patmore with whom she became involved in an affair. Patmore introduced H.D. to another poet, <a href="Richard%20Aldington">Richard Aldington</a>.

Soon after arriving in England, H.D. showed Pound some poems she had written. He had already begun to meet with other poets at the Eiffel Tower restaurant in <a href="Soho">Soho</a>. He was impressed by the closeness of her poems to the ideas and principles he had been discussing with Aldington, with whom he had shared plans to reform contemporary poetry through <a href="free%20verse">free verse</a>, the <a href="Waka%20%28poetry%29%23Tanka">tanka</a> and the tightness and conciseness of the <a href="haiku">haiku</a>, and the removal of all unnecessary verbiage. In summer 1912, the three poets declared themselves the "three original Imagists", and set out their principles as:

During a meeting with H.D. in a tea room near the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> that year, Pound appended the signature "H.D. Imagiste" to her poetry, creating a label that was to stick to the poet for most of her writing life. However, H.D. told different versions of this story at various times, and during her career published under a variety of pseudonyms. That same year <a href="Harriet%20Monroe">Harriet Monroe</a> started her magazine "<a href="Poetry%20%28magazine%29">Poetry</a>", and asked Pound to act as foreign editor. In October, he submitted three poems each by H.D. and Aldington under the rubric "Imagiste". Aldington's poems were in the November issue of "Poetry", and H.D.'s poems "Hermes of the Ways", "Orchard" and "Epigram" in the January 1913 issue. Imagism as a movement was launched with H.D. as its prime exponent.

The early models for the Imagist group were from Japan, and H.D. often visited the exclusive Print Room at the British Museum in the company of Richard Aldington and the curator and poet <a href="Laurence%20Binyon">Laurence Binyon</a>, in order to examine <a href="Nishiki-e">Nishiki-e</a> prints that incorporated <a href="Waka%20%28poetry%29">traditional Japanese verse</a>. However, she also derived her way of making poems from her reading of <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Classical Greek</a> literature and especially of <a href="Sappho">Sappho</a>, an interest she shared with Aldington and Pound, each of whom produced versions of the Greek poet's work. In 1915, H.D. and Aldington launched the Poets' Translation Series, pamphlets of translations from Greek and Latin classics. H.D. worked on the plays by <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>, publishing in 1916 a translation of choruses from "<a href="Iphigeneia%20at%20Aulis">Iphigeneia at Aulis</a>", in 1919 a translation of choruses from "Iphigeneia at Aulis" and "<a href="Hippolytus%20%28play%29">Hippolytus</a>", an adaptation of "Hippolytus" called "Hippolytus Temporizes" (1927), a translation of choruses from "<a href="The%20Bacchae">The Bacchae</a>" and "<a href="Hecuba%20%28play%29">Hecuba</a>" (1931), and "Euripides' Ion" (1937) a loose translation of "<a href="Ion%20%28play%29">Ion</a>".

She continued her association with the group until the final issue of the "Some Imagist Poets" anthology in 1917. She and Aldington did most of the editorial work on the 1915 anthology. Her work also appeared in Aldington's "Imagist Anthology 1930." All of her poetry up to the end of the 1930s was written in an Imagist mode, utilising spare use of language, and a classical, austere purity. This style of writing was not without its critics. In a special Imagist issue of "<a href="The%20Egoist%20%28periodical%29">The Egoist</a>" magazine in May 1915, the poet and critic <a href="Harold%20Monro">Harold Monro</a> called H.D.'s early work "petty poetry", denoting "either poverty of imagination or needlessly excessive restraint".

"<a href="Oread%20%28poem%29">Oread</a>", one of her earliest and best-known poems, which was first published in the 1915 anthology, illustrates this early style:

H.D. married Aldington in 1913; however, their first and only child, a daughter, was stillborn in 1915. Aldington enlisted in the army. The couple became estranged, and he reportedly took a mistress in 1917. H.D. became involved in a close but platonic relationship with <a href="D.%20H.%20Lawrence">D. H. Lawrence</a>. Her first book, "Sea Garden", was published in 1916, and she was appointed assistant editor of "The Egoist", replacing her husband. In 1918, her brother Gilbert was killed in action, and that March she moved into a cottage in Cornwall with the composer <a href="Cecil%20Gray%20%28composer%29">Cecil Gray</a>, a friend of Lawrence. She became pregnant with Gray's child; however, by the time she realised she was expecting, the relationship had cooled and Gray had returned to live in London. When Aldington returned from active service he was noticeably traumatised, and he and H.D. later separated.

Close to the end of the war, H.D. met the wealthy English novelist <a href="Bryher%20%28novelist%29">Bryher</a> (Annie Winifred Ellerman). They lived together until 1946, and although both took numerous other partners, Bryher remained her lover for the rest of H.D.'s life. In 1919, H.D. came close to death when she gave birth to her daughter Frances Perdita Aldington—although the father was not Aldington, but Gray—while suffering from <a href="Spanish%20flu">war influenza</a>. During this time, her father, who had never recovered from Gilbert's death, died. In 1919, H.D. wrote one of her few known statements on poetics, "Notes on Thought and Vision", which was unpublished until 1982. In this, she speaks of poets (herself included) as belonging to a kind of elite group of visionaries with the power to "turn the whole tide of human thought".

H.D. and Aldington attempted to salvage their relationship during this time, but he was suffering from the effects of his participation in the war (possibly <a href="post-traumatic%20stress%20disorder">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>) and they became estranged, living completely separate lives, but not divorcing until 1938. They remained friends, however, for the rest of their lives. From 1920, her relationship with Bryher became closer, and the pair travelled in Egypt, Greece and the United States before eventually settling in Switzerland. Bryher entered a <a href="marriage%20of%20convenience">marriage of convenience</a> in 1921 with <a href="Robert%20McAlmon">Robert McAlmon</a>, which allowed him to fund his publishing ventures in Paris by utilising some of her personal wealth for his Contact Press. Both Bryher and H.D. slept with McAlmon during this time. Bryher and McAlmon divorced in 1927.

In the early 1920s, H.D. started to write three projected cycles of novels. The first of these, "Magna Graeca", consists of "Palimpsest" (1921) and "Hedylus" (1928). The "Magna Graeca" novels use their classical settings to explore the poetic vocation, particularly as it applies to women in a patriarchal literary culture. The "Madrigal" cycle consists of "<a href="HERmione">HERmione</a>", "Bid Me to Live", "Paint It Today" and "Asphodel", and is largely autobiographical, dealing with the development of the female artist and the conflict between heterosexual and lesbian desire. "Kora and Ka" and "The Usual Star", two novellas from the "Borderline" cycle, were published in 1933. In this period, she also wrote "Pilate's Wife", "Mira-Mare" and "Nights".

During this period her mother had died, and Bryher had divorced her husband, only to marry H.D.'s new male lover, Kenneth Macpherson. H.D., Bryher and Macpherson lived together and traveled through Europe as what the poet and critic <a href="Barbara%20Guest">Barbara Guest</a> termed in her biography of H.D. as a 'menagerie of three.' Bryher and Macpherson adopted H.D.'s daughter, Perdita. H.D. became pregnant in 1928, but chose to abort the pregnancy in November. Bryher and Macpherson set up the magazine "Close Up" (to which H.D. regularly contributed) as a medium for intellectual discussion of cinema. In 1927, the small independent film cinema group POOL or <a href="Pool%20Group">Pool Group</a> was established (largely funded with Bryher's inheritance) and was managed by all three. Only one POOL film survives in its entirety, "<a href="Borderline%20%281930%20film%29">Borderline</a>" (1930), which featured H.D. and <a href="Paul%20Robeson">Paul Robeson</a> in the lead roles. In common with the "Borderline" novellas, the film explores extreme psychic states and their relationship to surface reality. As well as acting in this film, H.D. wrote an explanatory pamphlet to accompany it, a piece later published in "Close Up".

In 1933, H.D. traveled to Vienna to undergo analysis with <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>. She had an interest in Freud's theories as far back as 1909, when she read some of his works in the original German. H.D. was referred by Bryher's psychoanalyst due to her apparent paranoia about the rise of <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> which indicated another world war, an idea that H.D. found intolerable. The 'Great War' (World War I) had left her feeling shattered. She had lost her brother in action, while her husband suffered effects of combat experiences, and she believed that the onslaught of the war indirectly caused the death of her child with Aldington: she believed it was her shock at hearing the news about the <a href="RMS%20Lusitania">RMS "Lusitania"</a> that directly caused her child to be stillborn. "Writing on the Wall," her memoir about this psychoanalysis, was written concurrently with "Trilogy" and published in 1944; in 1956 it was republished with "Advent," a journal of the analysis, under the title "Tribute to Freud".

H.D. and Bryher spent the duration of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in London. During this time, H.D. wrote "The Gift", a memoir of her childhood and family life in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which reflects on people and events in her background that helped shape her as a writer. "The Gift" was eventually published in 1960 and 1982. She also wrote "Trilogy", published as "The Walls do not Fall" (1944), "Tribute to the Angels" (1945) and "The Flowering of the Rod" (1946). The opening lines of "The Walls do not Fall" clearly and immediately signal H.D.'s break with her earlier work:

After the war, H.D. and Bryher no longer lived together, but remained in contact. H.D. moved to Switzerland where, in the spring of 1946, she suffered a severe mental breakdown, which resulted in her staying in a clinic until the autumn of that year. Apart from a number of trips to the States, H.D. spent the rest of her life in Switzerland. In the late 1950s, she underwent more treatment, this time with the psychoanalyst Erich Heydt. At Heydt's prompting, she wrote "End to Torment", a memoir of her relationship with Pound, who allowed the poems of "Hilda's Book" to be included when the book was published. Doolittle was one of the leading figures in the bohemian culture of London in the early decades of the century. Her later poetry explores traditional epic themes, such as violence and war, from a feminist perspective. H.D. was the first woman to be granted the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Letters">American Academy of Arts and Letters</a> medal.

During the 1950s, H.D. wrote a considerable amount of poetry, most notably "Helen in Egypt" (written between 1952–54), an examination from a feminist point of view of a male-centred <a href="epic%20poetry">epic poetry</a>. H.D. used <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>'s play "<a href="Helen%20%28play%29">Helen</a>" as a starting point for a reinterpretation of the basis of the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a> and, by extension, of war itself. This work has been seen by some critics, including Jeffrey Twitchell-Waas, as H.D.'s response to Pound's "<a href="The%20Cantos">Cantos</a>", a work she greatly admired. Other poems from this period include "Sagesse", "Winter Love" and "Hermetic Definition". These three were published posthumously with the collective title "Hermetic Definition" (1972). The poem "Hermetic Definition" takes as its starting points her love for a man 30 years her junior and the line 'so slow is the rose to open' from Pound's "Canto 106". "Sagesse", written in bed after H.D. had broken her hip in a fall, serves as a kind of <a href="coda%20%28music%29">coda</a> to "Trilogy". being partly written in the voice of a young female Blitz survivor who finds herself living in fear of the <a href="Nuclear%20weapon%23Fission%20bombs">atom bomb</a>. "Winter Love" was written together with "End to Torment" and uses as narrator the <a href="Homer">Homer</a>ic figure of <a href="Penelope">Penelope</a> to restate the material of the memoir in poetic form. At one time, H.D. considered appending this poem as a coda to "Helen in Egypt."

H.D. visited the United States in 1960 to collect an American Academy of Arts and Letters medal. Returning to Switzerland, she suffered a <a href="stroke">stroke</a> in July 1961 and died a couple of months later in the Klinik Hirslanden in <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>. Her ashes were returned to Bethlehem, and were buried in the family plot in the Nisky Hill Cemetery on October 28, 1961. Her <a href="epitaph">epitaph</a> consists of the following lines from her early poem "Let Zeus Record":

The rediscovery of H.D. began in the 1970s, and coincided with the emergence of a <a href="feminism">feminist</a> criticism that found much to admire in the questioning of gender roles typical of her writings. Specifically, those critics who were challenging the standard view of English-language literary modernism based on the work of such male writers as Pound, Eliot and <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>, were able to restore H.D. to a more significant position in the history of that movement. Her writings have served as a model for a number of more recent women poets working in the modernist tradition, including the <a href="New%20York%20School%20%28art%29">New York School</a> poet <a href="Barbara%20Guest">Barbara Guest</a>, the <a href="English%20American">Anglo-American</a> poet <a href="Denise%20Levertov">Denise Levertov</a>, the <a href="Black%20Mountain%20poets">Black Mountain</a> poet <a href="Hilda%20Morley">Hilda Morley</a> and the "<a href="Language%20poets">Language</a>" poet <a href="Susan%20Howe">Susan Howe</a>. Her influence is not limited to female poets, and many male writers, including <a href="Robert%20Duncan%20%28poet%29">Robert Duncan</a> and <a href="Robert%20Creeley">Robert Creeley</a>, have acknowledged their debt.

Among her grandchildren was the author and <a href="Beatles">Beatles</a> biographer, <a href="Nicholas%20Schaffner">Nicholas Schaffner</a>.

Smilodon

Smilodon is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of the extinct <a href="machairodont">machairodont</a> subfamily of the <a href="felid">felid</a>s. It is one of the most famous prehistoric <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s, and the best known <a href="saber-toothed%20cat">saber-toothed cat</a>. Although commonly known as the saber-toothed tiger, it was not closely related to the <a href="tiger">tiger</a> or other modern cats. "Smilodon" lived in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a> during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> epoch (2.5 <a href="Year%23mya">mya</a>–10,000 years ago). The genus was named in 1842, based on <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s from Brazil. Three <a href="species">species</a> are recognized today: S. gracilis, S. fatalis, and S. populator. The two latter species were probably descended from "S. gracilis", which itself probably evolved from "<a href="Megantereon">Megantereon</a>". The hundreds of individuals obtained from the <a href="La%20Brea%20Tar%20Pits">La Brea Tar Pits</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> constitute the largest collection of "Smilodon" fossils.

Overall, "Smilodon" was more robustly built than any <a href="Neontology">extant</a> cat, with particularly well-developed forelimbs and exceptionally long upper <a href="canine%20teeth">canine teeth</a>. Its jaw had a bigger gape than that of modern cats, and its upper canines were slender and fragile, being adapted for precision killing. "S. gracilis" was the smallest species at in weight. "S. fatalis" had a weight of and height of . Both of these species are mainly known from <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, but remains from <a href="South%20America">South America</a> have also been attributed to them. "S. populator" from South America was the largest species, at in weight and in height, and was among the largest known felids. The <a href="Coat%20%28animal%29">coat</a> pattern of "Smilodon" is unknown, but it has been <a href="paleoart">artistically restored</a> with plain or spotted patterns.

In North America, "Smilodon" <a href="predation">hunted</a> large <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a>s such as <a href="Bison%20antiquus">bison</a> and <a href="Camelops">camels</a>, and it remained successful even when encountering new prey species in South America. "Smilodon" is thought to have killed its prey by holding it still with its forelimbs and biting it, but it is unclear in what manner the bite itself was delivered. Scientists debate whether "Smilodon" had a social or a solitary lifestyle; analysis of modern predator behavior as well as of "Smilodon"s fossil remains could be construed to lend support to either view. "Smilodon" probably lived in closed habitats such as forests and <a href="Shrubland">bush</a>, which would have provided cover for ambushing prey. "Smilodon" died out at the same time that most North and South American <a href="Pleistocene%20megafauna">megafauna</a> disappeared, about 10,000 years ago. Its reliance on large animals has been proposed as the cause of its extinction, along with climate change and competition with other species, but the exact cause is unknown.

During the 1830s, Danish <a href="naturalist">naturalist</a> <a href="Peter%20Wilhelm%20Lund">Peter Wilhelm Lund</a> and his assistants <a href="collected%20fossils">collected fossils</a> in the <a href="calcareous">calcareous</a> caves near the small town of <a href="Lagoa%20Santa%2C%20Minas%20Gerais">Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais</a>, Brazil. Among the thousands of fossils found, he recognized a few isolated <a href="cheek%20teeth">cheek teeth</a> as belonging to a <a href="hyena">hyena</a>, which he named "Hyaena neogaea" in 1839. After more material was found (including <a href="canine%20teeth">canine teeth</a> and foot bones), Lund concluded the fossils instead belonged to a distinct <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="felid">felid</a>, though transitional to the hyenas. He stated it would have matched the largest modern predators in size, and was more robust than any modern cat. Lund originally wanted to name the new genus "<a href="Hyaenodon">Hyaenodon</a>", but realizing this had recently become preoccupied by another prehistoric predator, he instead named it "Smilodon populator" in 1842. He explained the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> meaning of "Smilodon" as ("smilē"), a scalpel or two-edged knife, and "οδόντος" ("odontús"), tooth. This has also been translated as "tooth shaped like double-edged knife". He explained the species name "populator" as "the destroyer", which has also been translated as "he who brings devastation". By 1846, Lund had acquired nearly every part of the skeleton (from different individuals), and more specimens were found in neighboring countries by other collectors in the following years. Though some later authors used Lund's original species name "neogaea" instead of "populator", it is now considered an invalid "<a href="nomen%20nudum">nomen nudum</a>" ("naked name"), as it was not accompanied with a proper <a href="species%20description">description</a> and no type specimens were designated. Some South American specimens have been referred to other genera, subgenera, species, and <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, such as "Smilodontidion riggii", "Smilodon" ("Prosmilodon") "ensenadensis", and "S. bonaeriensis", but these are now thought to be <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29%23Zoology">junior synonyms</a> of "S. populator".

Fossils of "Smilodon" were discovered in North America from the second half of the 19th century onwards. In 1869, American paleontologist <a href="Joseph%20Leidy">Joseph Leidy</a> described a <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> fragment with a <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a>, which had been discovered in a petroleum bed in <a href="Hardin%20County%2C%20Texas">Hardin County, Texas</a>. He referred the specimen to the genus "<a href="Felis">Felis</a>" (which was then used for most cats, extant as well as extinct) but found it distinct enough to be part of its own <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a>, as "F." ("Trucifelis") "fatalis". The species name means "fate" or "destiny", but it is thought Leidy intended it to mean "fatal". In an 1880 article about extinct American cats, American paleontologist <a href="Edward%20Drinker%20Cope">Edward Drinker Cope</a> pointed out that the "F. fatalis" molar was identical to that of "Smilodon", and he proposed the <a href="new%20combination">new combination</a> "S. fatalis". Most North American finds were scanty until excavations began in the <a href="La%20Brea%20Tar%20Pits">La Brea Tar Pits</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, where hundreds of individuals of "S. fatalis" have been found since 1875. "S. fatalis" has junior synonyms such as "S. mercerii", "S. floridanus", and "S. californicus". American paleontologist Annalisa Berta considered the holotype of "S. fatalis" too incomplete to be an adequate type specimen, and the species has at times been proposed to be a junior synonym of "S. populator". Swedish paleontologists Björn Kurtén and Lars Werdelin supported the distinctness of the two species in 1990.

In his 1880 article about extinct cats, Cope also named a third species of "Smilodon", "S. gracilis". The species was based on a partial canine, which had been obtained in a cave near the <a href="Schuylkill%20River">Schuylkill River</a> in Pennsylvania. Cope found the canine to be distinct from that of the other "Smilodon" species due to its smaller size and more compressed base. Its <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> refers to the species' lighter build. This species is known from fewer and less complete remains than the other members of the genus. "S. gracilis" has at times been considered part of genera such as "<a href="Megantereon">Megantereon</a>" and "<a href="Ischyrosmilus">Ischyrosmilus</a>". "S. populator", "S. fatalis" and "S. gracilis" are currently considered the only valid species of "Smilodon", and features used to define most of their junior synonyms have been dismissed as variation between individuals of the same species (intraspecific variation). One of the most famous of prehistoric mammals, "Smilodon" has often been featured in popular media and is the <a href="state%20fossil">state fossil</a> of California.

Long the most completely known <a href="saber-toothed%20cat">saber-toothed cat</a>, "Smilodon" is still one of the best-known members of the group, to the point where the two concepts have been confused. The term "saber-tooth" refers to an <a href="ecomorph">ecomorph</a> consisting of various groups of extinct predatory <a href="synapsid">synapsid</a>s (mammals and close relatives), which <a href="convergently%20evolved">convergently evolved</a> extremely long <a href="maxillary%20canine">maxillary canine</a>s, as well as adaptations to the skull and skeleton related to their use. This includes members of <a href="Gorgonopsia">Gorgonopsia</a>, <a href="Thylacosmilidae">Thylacosmilidae</a>, <a href="Machaeroidinae">Machaeroidinae</a>, <a href="Nimravidae">Nimravidae</a>, <a href="Barbourofelidae">Barbourofelidae</a>, and <a href="Machairodontinae">Machairodontinae</a>. Within the family <a href="Felidae">Felidae</a> (true cats), members of the <a href="subfamily">subfamily</a> Machairodontinae are referred to as saber-toothed cats, and this group is itself divided into three <a href="Tribe%20%28biology%29">tribes</a>: <a href="Metailurini">Metailurini</a> (false saber-tooths); <a href="Homotherini">Homotherini</a> (<a href="scimitar">scimitar</a>-toothed cats); and <a href="Smilodontini">Smilodontini</a> (<a href="dirk">dirk</a>-toothed cats), to which "Smilodon" belongs. Members of Smilodontini are defined by their long slender canines with fine to no <a href="serration">serration</a>s, whereas Homotherini are typified by shorter, broad, and more flattened canines, with coarser serrations. Members of Metailurini were less specialized and had shorter, less flattened canines, and are not recognized as members of Machairodontinae by some researchers.

The earliest felids are known from the <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> of Europe, such as "<a href="Proailurus">Proailurus</a>", and the earliest one with saber-tooth features is the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> genus "<a href="Pseudaelurus">Pseudaelurus</a>". The skull and mandible morphology of the earliest saber-toothed cats was similar to that of the modern <a href="Neofelis">clouded leopards</a> ("Neofelis"). The lineage further adapted to the precision killing of large animals by developing elongated canine teeth and wider gapes, in the process sacrificing high <a href="Bite%20force%20quotient">bite force</a>. As their canines became longer, the bodies of the cats became more robust for immobilizing prey. In <a href="Autapomorphy">derived</a> smilodontins and homotherins, the <a href="lumbar">lumbar</a> region of the spine and the tail became shortened, as did the hind limbs. Based on <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> sequences <a href="Ancient%20DNA">extracted from fossils</a>, the lineages of "<a href="Homotherium">Homotherium</a>" and "Smilodon" are estimated to have diverged about 18 Ma ago. The earliest species of "Smilodon" is "S. gracilis", which existed from 2.5 <a href="Mya%20%28unit%29">million</a> to 500,000 years ago (early <a href="Blancan">Blancan</a> to <a href="Irvingtonian">Irvingtonian</a> ages) and was the successor in North America of "Megantereon", from which it probably evolved. "Megantereon" itself had entered North America from <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> during the <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>, along with "Homotherium". "S. gracilis" reached the northern regions of South America in the <a href="Early%20Pleistocene">Early Pleistocene</a> as part of the <a href="Great%20American%20Interchange">Great American Interchange</a>. The younger "Smilodon" species are probably derived from "S. gracilis". "S. fatalis" existed 1.6 million–10,000 years ago (late Irvingtonian to <a href="Rancholabrean">Rancholabrean</a> ages), and replaced "S. gracilis" in North America. "S. populator" existed 1 million–10,000 years ago (<a href="Ensenadan">Ensenadan</a> to <a href="Lujanian">Lujanian</a> ages); it occurred in the eastern parts of South America.

Despite the colloquial name "saber-toothed tiger", "Smilodon" is not closely related to the modern <a href="tiger">tiger</a> (which belongs in the subfamily <a href="Pantherinae">Pantherinae</a>), or any other extant felid. A 1992 ancient DNA analysis suggested that "Smilodon" should be grouped with modern cats (subfamilies <a href="Felinae">Felinae</a> and Pantherinae). A 2005 study found that "Smilodon" belonged to a separate lineage. A study published in 2006 confirmed this, showing that the Machairodontinae diverged early from the ancestors of modern cats and were not closely related to any living species. The following <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> based on fossils and DNA analysis shows the placement of "Smilodon" among extinct and extant felids, after Rincón and colleagues, 2011:

"Smilodon" was around the size of modern <a href="big%20cat">big cat</a>s, but was more robustly built. It had a reduced <a href="lumbar%20region">lumbar region</a>, high <a href="scapula">scapula</a>, short tail, and broad limbs with relatively short feet. "Smilodon" is most famous for its relatively long canine teeth, which are the longest found in the saber-toothed cats, at about long in the largest species, "S. populator". The canines were slender and had fine serrations on the front and back side. The skull was robustly proportioned and the <a href="snout">muzzle</a> was short and broad. The <a href="Zygomatic%20bone%23In%20other%20animals">cheek bones</a> (zygomata) were deep and widely arched, the <a href="sagittal%20crest">sagittal crest</a> was prominent, and the <a href="frontal%20region">frontal region</a> was slightly convex. The mandible had a flange on each side of the front. The upper incisors were large, sharp, and slanted forwards. There was a <a href="diastema">diastema</a> (gap) between the incisors and molars of the mandible. The lower incisors were broad, recurved, and placed in a straight line across. The p3 <a href="premolar">premolar</a> tooth of the mandible was present in most early specimens, but lost in later specimens; it was only present in 6% of the La Brea sample. There is some dispute over whether "Smilodon" was <a href="sexually%20dimorphic">sexually dimorphic</a>. Some studies of "S. fatalis" fossils have found little difference between the sexes. Conversely, a 2012 study found that, while fossils of "S. fatalis" show less variation in size among individuals than modern "Panthera", they do appear to show the same difference between the sexes in some traits.

"S. gracilis" was the smallest species, estimated at in weight, about the size of a <a href="jaguar">jaguar</a>. It was similar to its predecessor "Megantereon" of the same size, but its dentition and skull were more advanced, approaching "S. fatalis". "S. fatalis" was intermediate in size between "S. gracilis" and "S. populator". It ranged from . and reached a shoulder height of and body length of . It was similar to a lion in dimensions, but was more robust and muscular, and therefore had a larger body mass. Its skull was also similar to that of "Megantereon", though more massive and with larger canines. "S. populator" was among the <a href="List%20of%20largest%20mammals%23Carnivores%20%28Carnivora%29">largest known felids</a>, with a body mass range of , and one estimate suggesting up to . It stood at a shoulder height of . Compared to "S. fatalis", "S. populator" was more robust and had a more elongated and narrow skull with a straighter upper profile, higher positioned <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a>s, a more vertical <a href="occiput">occiput</a>, more massive <a href="metapodial">metapodial</a>s and slightly longer forelimbs relative to hindlimbs. Large tracks from Argentina (for which the <a href="ichnotaxon">ichnotaxon</a> name "Smilodonichium" has been proposed) have been attributed to "S. populator", and measure by . This is larger than tracks of the <a href="Bengal%20tiger">Bengal tiger</a>, to which the footprints have been compared.

Traditionally, saber-toothed cats have been <a href="paleoart">artistically restored</a> with external features similar to those of extant felids, by artists such as <a href="Charles%20R.%20Knight">Charles R. Knight</a> in collaboration with various paleontologists in the early 20th century. In 1969, paleontologist G. J. Miller instead proposed that "Smilodon" would have looked very different from a typical cat and similar to a <a href="bulldog">bulldog</a>, with a lower lip line (to allow its mouth to open wide without tearing the facial tissues), a more retracted nose and lower-placed ears. Paleoartist <a href="Mauricio%20Ant%C3%B3n">Mauricio Antón</a> and coauthors disputed this in 1998 and maintained that the facial features of "Smilodon" were overall not very different from those of other cats. Antón noted that modern animals like the <a href="hippopotamus">hippopotamus</a> are able to achieve a wide gap without tearing tissue by the moderate folding of the <a href="orbicularis%20oris%20muscle">orbicularis oris muscle</a>, and such a muscle configuration exists in modern large felids. Antón stated that <a href="extant%20phylogenetic%20bracketing">extant phylogenetic bracketing</a> (where the features of the closest extant relatives of a fossil taxon are used as reference) is the most reliable way of restoring the life-appearance of prehistoric animals, and the cat-like "Smilodon" restorations by Knight are therefore still accurate.

"Smilodon" and other saber-toothed cats have been reconstructed with both plain-colored <a href="Coat%20%28animal%29">coats</a> and with spotted patterns (which appears to be the ancestral condition for <a href="feliforms">feliforms</a>), both of which are considered possible. Studies of modern cat species have found that species that live in the open tend to have uniform coats while those that live in more vegetated habitats have more markings, with some exceptions. Some coat features, such as the manes of male lions or the stripes of the tiger, are too unusual to predict from fossils.

An <a href="apex%20predator">apex predator</a>, "Smilodon" primarily hunted large mammals. <a href="Isotope">Isotope</a>s preserved in the bones of "S. fatalis" in the La Brea Tar Pits reveal that <a href="ruminant">ruminant</a>s like bison ("<a href="Bison%20antiquus">Bison antiquus</a>", which was much larger than the modern <a href="American%20bison">American bison</a>) and camels ("<a href="Camelops">Camelops</a>") were most commonly taken by the cats there. In addition, isotopes preserved in the <a href="tooth%20enamel">tooth enamel</a> of "S. gracilis" specimens from Florida show that this species fed on the <a href="peccary">peccary</a> "<a href="Platygonus">Platygonus</a>" and the <a href="llama">llama</a>-like "<a href="Hemiauchenia">Hemiauchenia</a>". In rare cases, "Smilodon" may have also targeted <a href="glyptodont">glyptodont</a>s, based on a "<a href="Glyptotherium">Glyptotherium</a>" skull that bears elliptical puncture marks consistent with the size and diameter of its canine teeth. This was a juvenile glyptodont with an incompletely developed cephalic shield (head armor). Isotopic studies of <a href="dire%20wolf">dire wolf</a> ("Canis dirus") and <a href="American%20lion">American lion</a> ("Panthera leo atrox") bones show an overlap with "S. fatalis" in prey, which suggests that they were competitors. The availability of prey in the Rancho La Brea area was likely comparable to modern <a href="East%20Africa">East Africa</a>. As "Smilodon" migrated to South America, its diet changed; bison were absent, the <a href="Equus%20%28genus%29">horses</a> and <a href="proboscidea">proboscidea</a>ns were different, and native ungulates such as <a href="toxodonts">toxodonts</a> and <a href="litopterns">litopterns</a> were completely unfamiliar, yet "S. populator" thrived as well there as its relatives in North America. The differences between the North and South American species may be due to the difference in prey between the two continents. "Smilodon" probably avoided eating bone and would have left enough food for scavengers. "Smilodon" itself may have scavenged dire wolf kills. It has been suggested that "Smilodon" was a pure scavenger that used its canines for display to assert dominance over carcasses, but this theory is not supported today as no modern terrestrial mammals are pure scavengers.

The <a href="brain">brain</a> of "Smilodon" had <a href="Sulcus%20%28neuroanatomy%29">sulcal</a> patterns similar to modern cats, which suggests an increased complexity of the regions that control the sense of hearing, sight, and coordination of the limbs. Felid saber-tooths in general had relatively small <a href="Cat%20senses%23Sight">eyes</a> that were not as forward-facing as those of modern cats, which have good <a href="binocular%20vision">binocular vision</a> to help them move in trees. "Smilodon" was likely an <a href="ambush%20predator">ambush predator</a> that concealed itself in dense vegetation, as its limb proportions were similar to modern forest dwelling cats, and its short tail would not have helped it balance while running. Unlike its ancestor "Megantereon", which was at least partially <a href="scansorial">scansorial</a> and therefore able to climb trees, "Smilodon" was probably completely terrestrial due to its greater weight and lack of climbing adaptations. The <a href="heel%20bone">heel bone</a> of "Smilodon" was fairly long, which suggests it was a good jumper. Its well-developed flexor and extensor muscles in its <a href="forearm">forearm</a>s probably enabled it to pull down, and securely hold down, large prey. Analysis of the cross-sections of "S. fatalis" <a href="humerus">humeri</a> indicated that they were strengthened by <a href="cortical%20thickening">cortical thickening</a> to such an extent that they would have been able to sustain greater loading than those of extant big cats, or of the extinct American lion. The thickening of "S. fatalis" <a href="femur">femur</a>s was within the range of extant felids. Its canines were fragile and could not have bitten into bone; due to the risk of breaking, these cats had to subdue and restrain their prey with their powerful forelimbs before they could use their canine teeth, and likely used quick slashing or stabbing bites rather than the slow, suffocating bites typically used by modern cats. On rare occasions, as evidenced by fossils, "Smilodon" was willing to risk biting into bone with its canines. This may have been focused more towards competition such as other "Smilodon" or potential threats such as other carnivores than on prey.
Debate continues as to how "Smilodon" killed its prey. Traditionally, the most popular theory is that the cat delivered a deep stabbing bite or open-jawed stabbing thrust to the throat, generally cutting through the <a href="jugular">jugular</a> vein and/or the <a href="Vertebrate%20trachea">trachea</a> and thus killing the prey very quickly. Another hypothesis suggests that "Smilodon" targeted the belly of its prey. This is disputed, as the curvature of their prey's belly would likely have prevented the cat from getting a good bite or stab. In regard to how "Smilodon" delivered its bite, the "canine shear-bite" hypothesis has been favored, where flexion of the neck and rotation of the skull assisted in biting the prey, but this may be mechanically impossible. The mandibular flanges may have helped resist bending forces when the mandible was pulled against the hide of a prey. The protruding incisors were arranged in an arch, and were used to hold the prey still and stabilize it while the canine bite was delivered. The contact surface between the canine crown and the gum was enlarged, which helped stabilize the tooth and helped the cat sense when the tooth had penetrated to its maximum extent. Since saber-toothed cats generally had a relatively large <a href="infraorbital%20foramen">infraorbital foramen</a> (opening) in the skull, which housed nerves associated with the whiskers, it has been suggested the improved senses would have helped the cats' precision when biting outside their field of vision, and thereby prevent breakage of the canines. The blade-like <a href="carnassial">carnassial</a> teeth were used to cut skin to access the meat, and the reduced molars suggest that they were less adapted for crushing bones than modern cats. As the food of modern cats enters the mouth through the side while cutting with the carnassials, not the front incisors between the canines, the animals do not need to gape widely, so the canines of "Smilodon" would likewise not have been a hindrance when feeding.

Despite being more powerfully built than other large cats, "Smilodon" had a weaker bite. Modern big cats have more pronounced <a href="zygomatic%20arch">zygomatic arch</a>es, while these were smaller in "Smilodon", which restricted the thickness and therefore power of the <a href="temporalis%20muscle">temporalis muscle</a>s and thus reduced "Smilodon"&apos;s bite force. Analysis of its narrow jaws indicates that it could produce a bite only a third as strong as that of a lion (the bite force quotient measured for the lion is 112). There seems to be a general rule that the saber-toothed cats with the largest canines had proportionally weaker bites. Analyses of canine <a href="Flexural%20strength">bending strength</a> (the ability of the canine teeth to resist bending forces without breaking) and bite forces indicate that the saber-toothed cats' teeth were stronger relative to the bite force than those of modern big cats. In addition, "Smilodon"&apos;s gape could have reached almost 120 degrees, while that of the modern lion reaches 65 degrees. This made the gape wide enough to allow "Smilodon" to grasp large prey despite the long canines. A 2018 study compared the killing behaviour of "Smilodon fatalis" and "Homotherium serum", and found that the former had a strong skull with little <a href="trabecular%20bone">trabecular bone</a> for a stabbing canine-shear bite, whereas the latter had more trabecular bone and used a clamp and hold style more similar to lions. The two would therefore have held distinct ecological niches.

Many "Smilodon" specimens have been excavated from <a href="asphalt%20seeps">asphalt seeps</a> that acted as natural carnivore traps. Animals were accidentally trapped in the seeps and became bait for predators that came to scavenge, but these were then trapped themselves. The best-known of such traps are at <a href="La%20Brea%20Tar%20Pits">La Brea</a> in Los Angeles, which have produced over 166,000 "Smilodon fatalis" specimens that form the largest collection in the world. The sediments of the pits there were accumulated 40,000 to 10,000 years ago, in the <a href="Late%20Pleistocene">Late Pleistocene</a>. Though the trapped animals were buried quickly, predators often managed to remove limb bones from them, but they were themselves often trapped and then scavenged by other predators; 90% of the excavated bones belonged to predators.

The Talara Tar Seeps in Peru represent a similar scenario, and have also produced fossils of "Smilodon". Unlike in La Brea, many of the bones were broken or show signs of weathering. This may have been because the layers were shallower, so the thrashing of trapped animals damaged the bones of previously trapped animals. Many of the carnivores at Talara were juveniles, possibly indicating that inexperienced and less fit animals had a greater chance of being trapped. Though Lund thought accumulations of "Smilodon" and herbivore fossils in the Lagoa Santa Caves were due to the cats using the caves as dens, these are probably the result of animals dying on the surface, and water currents subsequently dragging their bones to the floor of the cave, but some individuals may also have died after becoming lost in the caves.

Scientists debate whether "Smilodon" was <a href="social%20animal">social</a>. One study of African predators found that social predators like <a href="lion">lion</a>s and <a href="spotted%20hyena">spotted hyena</a>s respond more to the <a href="distress%20call">distress call</a>s of prey than solitary species. Since "S. fatalis" fossils are common at the La Brea Tar Pits, and were likely attracted by the distress calls of stuck prey, this could mean that this species was social as well. One critical study claims that the study neglects other factors, such as body mass (heavier animals are more likely to get stuck than lighter ones), intelligence (some social animals, like the American lion, may have avoided the tar because they were better able to recognize the hazard), lack of visual and <a href="olfactory">olfactory</a> lures, the type of audio lure, and the length of the distress calls (the actual distress calls of the trapped prey animals would have lasted longer than the calls used in the study). The author of that study ponders what predators would have responded if the recordings were played in India, where the otherwise solitary tigers are known to aggregate around a single carcass. The authors of the original study responded that though effects of the calls in the tar pits and the playback experiments would not be identical, this would not be enough to overturn their conclusions. In addition, they stated that weight and intelligence would not likely affect the results as lighter carnivores are far more numerous than heavy herbivores and the social (and seemingly intelligent) dire wolf is also found in the pits.

Another argument for sociality is based on the healed injuries in several "Smilodon" fossils, which would suggest that the animals needed others to provide it food. This argument has been questioned, as cats can recover quickly from even severe bone damage and an injured "Smilodon" could survive if it had access to water. The brain of "Smilodon" was relatively small compared to other cat species. Some researchers have argued that "Smilodon"&apos;s brain would have been too small for it to have been a social animal. An analysis of brain size in living big cats found no correlation between brain size and sociality. Another argument against "Smilodon" being social is that being an ambush hunter in closed habitat would likely have made group-living unnecessary, as in most modern cats. Yet it has also been proposed that being the largest predator in an environment comparable to the savanna of Africa, "Smilodon" may have had a social structure similar to modern lions, which possibly live in groups primarily to defend optimal territory from other lions (lions are the only social big cats today).

Whether "Smilodon" was sexually dimorphic has implications for its reproductive behavior. Based on their conclusions that "Smilodon fatalis" had no sexual dimorphism, Van Valkenburgh and Sacco suggested in 2002 that, if the cats were social, they would likely have lived in <a href="Monogamous%20pairing%20in%20animals">monogamous pairs</a> (along with offspring) with no intense competition among males for females. Likewise, Meachen-Samuels and Binder (2010) concluded that aggression between males was less pronounced in "S. fatalis" than in the American lion. Christiansen and Harris (2012) found that, as "S. fatalis" did exhibit some sexual dimorphism, there would have been evolutionary selection for competition between males. The structure of the <a href="hyoid%20bone">hyoid bone</a>s suggest that "Smilodon" communicated by <a href="roar%20%28utterance%29">roaring</a>, like modern big cats. The ability to roar may have implications for the social life of "Smilodon".

"Smilodon" started developing its adult saber-teeth when the animal turned one-and-a-half years of age, shortly after the completion of the eruption of the cat's <a href="baby%20teeth">baby teeth</a>. Both baby and adult canines would be present side by side in the mouth for an 11-month period, and the muscles used in making the powerful bite were developed at about one-and-a-half years old as well, eight months earlier than in a modern lion. After "Smilodon" turned around 20 months of age, the infant teeth were shed while the adult canines grew at an average growth rate of per month during a 12-month period. They reached their full size at around 3 years of age, later than for modern species of big cat. Juvenile and adolescent "Smilodon" specimens are extremely rare at Rancho La Brea, where the study was performed, indicating that they remained hidden or at denning sites during hunts, and depended on parental care while their canines were developing.

A 2017 study indicates that juveniles were born with a robust build similar to the adults. Comparison of the bones of juvenile "S. fatalis" specimens from La Brea with those of the contemporaneous American lion revealed that the two cats shared a similar growth curve. Felid forelimb development during <a href="ontogeny">ontogeny</a> (changes during growth) has remained tightly constrained. The curve is similar to that for modern cats such as tigers and cougars, but shifts more towards the robust direction of the axes than is seen in modern felids.

Several "Smilodon" fossils show signs of <a href="ankylosing%20spondylitis">ankylosing spondylitis</a>, <a href="hyperostosis">hyperostosis</a> and trauma; some also had <a href="arthritis">arthritis</a>, which gave them fused vertebrae. One study of 1,000 "Smilodon" skulls found that 30% of them had eroded <a href="parietal%20bone">parietal bone</a>s, which is where the largest jaw muscles attach. They also showed signs of microfractures, and the weakening and thinning of bones possibly caused by mechanical stress from the constant need to make stabbing motions with the canines. Bony growths where the <a href="deltoid%20muscle">deltoid muscle</a> inserted in the humerus is a common pathology for a La Brea specimen, which was probably due to repeated strain when "Smilodon" attempted to pull down prey with its forelimbs. Sternum injuries are also common, probably due to collision with prey. Some bones also show evidence of having been bitten by other "Smilodon", with one skull showing an unhealed wound from a canine, seemingly fatal, and a scapula from the same site that had been pierced by a canine. The frequency of trauma in "S. fatalis" specimens was 4.3%, compared to 2.8% in the dire wolf, which implies the ambush predatory behavior of the former led to greater risk of injury than the pursuit predatory behavior of the latter. "Smilodon" remains exhibit relatively more shoulder and <a href="lumbar%20vertebrae">lumbar vertebrae</a> injuries.

"Smilodon" lived during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> epoch (2.5 mya–10,000 years ago), and was perhaps the most recent of the saber-toothed cats. "Smilodon" probably lived in a closed habitat such as forest or <a href="Shrubland">bush</a>. Fossils of the genus have been found throughout the Americas. In North America, the varied habitat supported other saber-toothed cats in addition to "Smilodon", such as "Homotherium" and "<a href="Xenosmilus">Xenosmilus</a>"; the habitat here varied from subtropical forests and savannah in the south, to treeless <a href="mammoth%20steppes">mammoth steppes</a> in the north. "Smilodon" inhabited the <a href="temperate">temperate</a> latitudes of North America, where the mosaic vegetation of woods, shrubs, and grasses in the southwest supported large herbivores such as horses, bison, <a href="Antilocapridae">antelope</a>, <a href="deer">deer</a>, camels, <a href="mammoth">mammoth</a>s, <a href="mastodon">mastodon</a>s, and <a href="ground%20sloth">ground sloth</a>s. Other large carnivores included dire wolves, <a href="short-faced%20bear">short-faced bear</a> ("Arctodus simus") and the American lion. Due to competition from larger carnivores in North America, "S. fatalis" was perhaps not able to attain the same size as "S. populator". The similar sizes of "S. fatalis" and the American lion suggests niche overlap and direct competition between these species, and they appear to have fed on similarly sized prey.

"S. gracilis" entered South America during the early to middle Pleistocene, where it probably gave rise to "S. populator", which lived in the eastern part of the continent. "S. fatalis" also entered western South America in the late Pleistocene, and the two species were thought to be divided by the <a href="Andes%20mountains">Andes mountains</a>. However, in 2018, a skull of "S. fatalis" found in <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> east of the Andes was reported, which puts the idea that the two species were <a href="allopatric">allopatric</a> (geographically separated) into question. The American interchange resulted in a mix of native and <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a> sharing the prairies and woodlands in South America; North American herbivores included proboscideans, horses, <a href="camelid">camelid</a>s and deer, South American herbivores included toxodonts, litopterns, ground sloths, and glyptodonts. Native <a href="metatherian">metatherian</a> predators (including the saber-toothed thylacosmilids) had gone extinct by the Pliocene, and were replaced by North American carnivores such as canids, bears, and large cats.

"S. populator" was very successful, while "Homotherium" never became widespread in South America. The extinction of the thylacosmilids has been attributed to competition with "Smilodon", but this is probably incorrect, as they seem to have disappeared before the arrival of the large cats. The <a href="phorusrhacid">phorusrhacid</a> "terror birds" may have dominated the large predator niche in South America until "Smilodon" arrived. "S. populator" may have been able to reach larger size than "S. fatalis" due to a lack of competition in Pleistocene South America; "S. populator" arrived after the extinction of "<a href="Arctotherium%20angustidens">Arctotherium angustidens</a>", one of the largest carnivores ever, and could therefore assume the niche of mega-carnivore. "S. populator" preferred large prey from open habitats such as grassland and plains, based on evidence gathered from isotope ratios that determined the animal's diet. In this way, the South American "Smilodon" species was probably similar to the modern lion. "S. populator" probably competed with the canid "<a href="Protocyon">Protocyon</a>" there, but not with the jaguar, which fed primarily on smaller prey.

Along with most of the Pleistocene megafauna, "Smilodon" became extinct 10,000 years ago in the <a href="Quaternary%20extinction%20event">Quaternary extinction event</a>. Its extinction has been linked to the decline and extinction of large herbivores, which were replaced by smaller and more agile ones like deer. Hence, "Smilodon" could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. A 2012 study of "Smilodon" tooth wear found no evidence that they were limited by food resources. Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans (who entered the Americas around the time "Smilodon" disappeared), or a combination of several factors, all of which apply to the general Pleistocene extinction event, rather than specifically to the extinction of the saber-toothed cats.

Some early writers theorized that the last saber-toothed cats, "Smilodon" and "Homotherium", became extinct through competition with the faster and more generalized felids that replaced them. It was even proposed that the saber-toothed predators were inferior to modern cats, as the ever-growing canines were thought to inhibit their owners from feeding properly. Yet fast felids, such as the American lion and the <a href="American%20cheetah">American cheetah</a>, also became extinct during the Late Pleistocene. The fact that saber-teeth evolved many times in unrelated lineages also attests to the success of this feature.

The latest "Smilodon fatalis" specimen recovered from the Rancho La Brea tar pits has been dated to 13,025 years ago.
The latest "Smilodon populator" remains found in the cave of Cueva del Medio, near the town of Soria, northeast <a href="%C3%9Altima%20Esperanza%20Province">Última Esperanza Province</a>, <a href="Magallanes%20Region">Magallanes Region</a> in southern-most <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, and have been dated 10,935–11,209 years ago.
