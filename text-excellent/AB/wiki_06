History of Tottenham Hotspur F.C.

Tottenham Hotspur F.C. is an English <a href="Association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Tottenham">Tottenham</a>, London that came into existence in 1882. Formed as Hotspur Football Club by a group of schoolboys, it was renamed <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur F.C.</a> in 1884, and is commonly referred to as Spurs. Initially <a href="Amateur%20sports%23Association%20football">amateur</a>, the club became professional in 1895. Spurs won the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> in <a href="1900%E2%80%9301%20in%20English%20football">1901</a> before joining the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a>, becoming the only <a href="non-League%20football">non-League</a> club to achieve the feat since the formation of the League. Since then, the club has won the FA Cup a further seven times, the Football League twice, the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> four times, the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> twice and the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a>. The Cup Winners' Cup in 1963 was the first <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> competition won by an English team. In <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20in%20English%20football">1960–61</a>, Tottenham became the first team to complete <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">The Double</a> in the 20th century.

Tottenham played in the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> from 1896 until 1908, before election to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Football League Second Division</a>. The club won promotion into the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> the following year, where it stayed until the late 1920s. The club languished mostly in the Second Division until the 1950s, when it enjoyed a revival, reaching a peak in the 1960s. Fortunes dipped after the early 1970s but resurged in the 1980s. Tottenham has remained a member of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> since its formation in 1992, finishing in mid-table most seasons.

Of the club's thirty-two managers to date, <a href="John%20Cameron%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201872%29">John Cameron</a> was the first to win a major trophy, the 1901 FA Cup. <a href="Peter%20McWilliam">Peter McWilliam</a> added a second FA Cup win for the club in 1921. <a href="Arthur%20Rowe">Arthur Rowe</a> developed the "<a href="push%20and%20run">push and run</a>" style of play in the 1950s and led the club to its first league title. <a href="Bill%20Nicholson%20%28footballer%29">Bill Nicholson</a> oversaw the <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29%23England">Double</a> winning side as well as the most successful period of the club's history, in the 1960s and early '70s. Later prominent managers include <a href="Keith%20Burkinshaw">Keith Burkinshaw</a>, the second most successful in terms of major trophies won, with two FA Cups and a UEFA Cup, and <a href="Terry%20Venables">Terry Venables</a>, under whom the club collected another FA Cup in 1991.

Spurs played their early games on public land at <a href="Tottenham%20Marshes">Tottenham Marshes</a>, but by 1888 they were playing on rented ground at <a href="Northumberland%20Park%2C%20London">Northumberland Park</a> in Tottenham. In 1899 the club moved to a site that became known as <a href="White%20Hart%20Lane">White Hart Lane</a>, where a stadium was gradually developed. Spurs remained there until 2017. A new stadium, the <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20Stadium">Tottenham Hotspur Stadium</a>, is currently being built at the same site; home matches have been played at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> during construction.

The Hotspur Football Club was formed in 1882 by a group of schoolboys from Saint John's Middle Class School and <a href="Tottenham%20Grammar%20School">Tottenham Grammar School</a>. Mostly aged 13 to 14, the boys were members of the Hotspur <a href="Cricket">Cricket</a> Club formed two years earlier. <a href="Bobby%20Buckle">Robert Buckle</a> with his two friends Sam Casey and John Anderson conceived the idea so they could continue to play sport during the winter months. Club lore states that the boys gathered one night under a lamppost along <a href="Tottenham%20High%20Road">Tottenham High Road</a> about 100 yards/metres from the now-demolished <a href="White%20Hart%20Lane">White Hart Lane</a> ground, and agreed to form a football club. The date of their meeting is unknown, so the Hotspur Football Club is taken to have been formed on 5 September 1882, when the eleven boys had to start paying their first annual subscriptions of <a href="Sixpence%20%28British%20coin%29">sixpence</a>; by the end of the year the club had eighteen members. Although the name "Northumberland Rovers" was mooted, the boys settled on the name "Hotspur". As with the cricket club, it was chosen in honour of Sir <a href="Henry%20%27Hotspur%27%20Percy">Henry Percy</a> (better known as Harry Hotspur, the rebel of Shakespeare's <a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20part%201">Henry IV, part 1</a>), whose <a href="Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Northumberland</a> family once owned land in the area, including <a href="Northumberland%20Park%2C%20London">Northumberland Park</a> in Tottenham.

The boys initially held their meetings under lampposts in Northumberland Park or in half-built houses on the adjoining Willoughby Lane in Tottenham. In August 1883 the boys sought the assistance of John Ripsher, the warden of Tottenham <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a> and Bible-class teacher at <a href="All%20Hallows%27%20Church%2C%20Tottenham">All Hallows Church</a>, who became the first president of the club and its treasurer. A few days later he presided over a meeting of twenty-one club members in the basement kitchen of the YMCA at Percy House or its annex on the High Road, which became the club's first headquarters. Ripsher, who continued as president until 1894, supported the boys through the club's formative years, reorganising it and establishing the club's ethos. The stability he provided in the early years helped the club to survive, unlike many others of the period that did not. Ripsher found new premises for the club when the boys were evicted in 1884 after a YMCA council member was accidentally hit by a soot-covered football: first at 1 Dorset Villa on Northumberland Park where they stayed for two years, then to the Red House on High Road in 1886 after they were again asked to leave, this time for playing cards in church. The Red House, which stood beside the entrance gate to White Hart Lane but was demolished in 2016 during the ground's redevelopment, was the club's headquarters until its move to 808 High Road in 1891 and later to White Hart Lane. In April 1884, owing to letters for another established club "London Hotspur" being misdirected to North London, the club was renamed Tottenham Hotspur Football Club to avoid any further confusion. The team were referred to as "Spurs" as early as 1883, and they have also been called "the Lilywhites" after the white jerseys they have worn since the late 19th century.

The boys played their early matches on public ground at <a href="Tottenham%20Marshes">Tottenham Marshes</a>, where they needed to mark out and prepare their own pitch, and on occasions had to defend against other teams who might try to take it over. Local pubs were used as dressing rooms. Robert Buckle was the team's first captain, and for two years the boys largely played games among themselves, but the number of <a href="Exhibition%20game">friendly</a> fixtures against other clubs gradually increased. The first recorded match took place on 30 September 1882 against a local team named the Radicals, a game Hotspur lost 2–0. The first game reported by the local press was on 6 October 1883 against Brownlow Rovers, which Spurs won 9–0. The club played its first competitive match on 17 October 1885 against St Albans, a company works team, in the London Association Cup. The match was attended by 400 spectators, and Spurs won 5–2. In the early days Spurs were essentially a schoolboy team, sometimes playing against adults, but older players later joined, and the squad strengthened as they absorbed players from other local clubs. Some of the early members such as Buckle, Sam Casey, John Thompson and <a href="Jack%20Jull">Jack Jull</a> stayed with the club for many years as players, committee members or directors; for example Jull played until 1896, while Buckle served in various roles on the club committee and was on the first board of directors of Tottenham formed in 1898 until he left in 1900.

The club's matches began to attract the interest of the local community, and the number of spectators grew to 4,000 within a few years. As their games were played on public land, no admission fees could be charged for spectators. In 1888 Tottenham moved their home fixtures from the Tottenham Marshes to Northumberland Park, where they rented an enclosed ground and were able to charge for spectator admission. The first match there was in October 1888, a reserve match that yielded gate receipts of 17 shillings. A week later they were beaten 8–2 by <a href="Old%20Etonians%20F.C.">Old Etonians</a> in their first senior game at the ground. Spectators were usually charged <a href="Threepence%20%28British%20coin%29">3d</a> a game, raised to <a href="Sixpence%20%28British%20coin%29">6d</a> for cup ties. By the early 1890s, a cup tie may have a few thousand paying spectators. In the early days there were no stands except for a couple of wagons as seats and wooden trestles for spectators to stand on, but for the <a href="1894%E2%80%9395%20in%20English%20football">1894–95 season</a>, the first stand with just over 100 seats and a changing room underneath was built on the ground. The club attempted to join the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> in 1892 but failed when it received only one vote. Instead, the club played in the short-lived <a href="Southern%20Alliance">Southern Alliance</a> for the <a href="1892%E2%80%9393%20in%20English%20football">1892–93 season</a>.

Spurs initially played in navy-blue shirts with a letter H on a scarlet shield on the left breast and white <a href="breeches">breeches</a>. The club colours were changed in 1884 or 1885 to light blue and white halved jerseys and white shorts, inspired by watching <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> win the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> at the <a href="The%20Oval">Kennington Oval</a> in 1884, before returning to the original dark blue shirts for the <a href="1889%E2%80%9390%20in%20English%20football">1889–90 season</a>. From 1890 to 1895, the club had red shirts and blue shorts, changed in 1895 to chocolate brown and gold narrow striped shirts and dark-blue shorts. Finally, in the <a href="1898%E2%80%9399%20in%20English%20football">1898–99 season</a>, the strip was changed to the now familiar white shirts and navy-blue shorts.

The club became unwittingly involved in a controversy known as the Payne Boots Affair in October 1893. A reserve player from <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>, Ernie Payne, agreed to play for Spurs but arrived without any kit as it had apparently been stolen at Fulham. As no suitable boots could be found, the club gave him 10 shillings to buy his boots. Fulham then complained to the <a href="London%20Football%20Association">London Football Association</a> that Tottenham had poached their player, and accused them of professionalism breaching amateur rules. On the latter charge, the London Football Association found Tottenham guilty, as the payment for the boots was judged an "unfair inducement" to attract the player to the club. Spurs were suspended for a fortnight and as a result were eliminated from the <a href="FA%20Amateur%20Cup">FA Amateur Cup</a>, as they had to forfeit their second-round match against <a href="Clapham%20Rovers%20F.C.">Clapham Rovers</a>. Despite the punishment, the controversy had an unexpected positive effect on the club. Press coverage of the incident raised the national profile of what was then a local amateur club, and gained them sympathy for what many thought was unfair treatment. Invitations from other clubs to play games increased, and attendance at Spurs' matches rose. The publicity also brought on board two individuals who went on to run the club: Charles Roberts and local businessman John Oliver, who also provided funding.

With an increasing number of teams to play against, the quality of Spurs' opposition also improved. To compete against better teams, the club committee, led by the second president of the club John Oliver, agreed that the club should turn professional. Robert Buckle made the proposal at a meeting on 16 December 1895, which was accepted after a vote, and the club gained its professional status on 20 December 1895. Spurs made a failed attempt to join the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a>, but were admitted to Division One of the Southern League in mid-1896. Later they also participated in other leagues, including the United League and <a href="Western%20Football%20League">Western League</a>, in which they did not always field the full first team. The team was almost entirely rebuilt over the next two years; the first two professional players, Jock Montgomery and J. Logan, were quickly recruited from Scotland, and in 1897 the club also signed its first international, <a href="Jack%20Jones%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201869%29">Jack Jones</a>.

On 2 March 1898, Spurs decided to become a limited company—the Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company—to raise funds and to limit the personal liability of its members. Eight thousand shares were issued at £1 each, but only 1,558 were taken up by the public in the first year. A board of directors was formed with Oliver as chairman, but he retired after the company reported a loss of £501 at the end of the season in 1899. Charles Roberts took over as chairman and remained in the post until 1943.

On 14 March 1898, soon after the club became a limited company, <a href="Frank%20Brettell">Frank Brettell</a> was appointed the first manager of Spurs. He signed several players from northern clubs, including <a href="Harry%20Erentz">Harry Erentz</a>, <a href="Tom%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201876%29">Tom Smith</a>, and in particular <a href="John%20Cameron%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201872%29">John Cameron</a>, who signed from <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> in May 1898 and was to have a considerable impact on the history of the club. Cameron became player-manager the following February, after Bretell left to take a better-paid position at <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a>, and led the club to its first trophies: the Southern League title in <a href="1899%E2%80%931900%20Southern%20Football%20League">1899–1900</a> and the <a href="1900%E2%80%9301%20FA%20Cup">1901 FA Cup</a>. In his first year as manager, Cameron signed seven players: <a href="George%20Clawley">George Clawley</a>, <a href="Ted%20Hughes%20%28footballer%29">Ted Hughes</a>, <a href="David%20Copeland%20%28footballer%29">David Copeland</a>, <a href="Tom%20Morris%20%28footballer%29">Tom Morris</a>, <a href="Jack%20Kirwan">Jack Kirwan</a>, <a href="Sandy%20Tait">Sandy Tait</a> and <a href="Tom%20Pratt%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201873%29">Tom Pratt</a>. The following year <a href="Sandy%20Brown%20%28footballer%20born%201879%29">Sandy Brown</a> replaced Pratt, who wanted to return to the North despite being the top goalscorer. They, together with Cameron, Erentz, Smith and Jones, formed the 1901 Cup-winning team.

On <a href="Good%20Friday">Good Friday</a> 1898 a match was held against <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Woolwich Arsenal</a> at Northumberland Park, attended by a record crowd of 14,000. In the overcrowded ground, fans climbed up onto the roof of the refreshment stand to get a better view. The stand collapsed causing a few injuries, which prompted the club to start looking for a new ground. In 1899 the club moved a short distance to a piece of land behind the White Hart pub. The White Hart Lane site, actually behind <a href="Tottenham%20High%20Road">Tottenham High Road</a>, was a <a href="nursery%20%28horticulture%29">nursery</a> owned by the brewery chain <a href="Charrington%20Brewery">Charringtons</a>. The club initially leased the ground from Charringtons, but development of the ground was restricted by the terms of the lease. In 1905, after issuing shares towards the cost of purchase, Spurs bought the freehold for £8,900 and paid a further £2,600 for a piece of land at the northern end. By then the ground had a covered stand on the west side and earth mounds on the other three sides.

The ground was never officially named, but it became popularly known as White Hart Lane, also the name of a local <a href="thoroughfare">thoroughfare</a>. The first game at White Hart Lane was a friendly against <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a> on 4 September 1899 that Spurs won 4–1, and the first competitive game on the ground was held five days later against <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a>, a game won by Spurs 1–0. In 1900, Tottenham won the Southern League title, the first trophy won by the club. After the win, the club was dubbed "Flower of the South" by the press.

In the <a href="1900%E2%80%9301%20FA%20Cup">1901 FA Cup</a>, Spurs reached the final after beating Preston North End, <a href="Bury%20F.C.">Bury</a>, <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a> and <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>; all apart from Reading were Football League Division One teams of the <a href="1900%E2%80%9301%20in%20English%20football">1900–01 season</a>. The <a href="1901%20FA%20Cup%20Final">final</a> was played at <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20National%20Sports%20Centre">Crystal Palace</a> against Division One <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>, and was attended by 110,820 spectators, at that time the largest crowd ever for a football match. The game ended in a 2–2 draw, with both of Spurs' goals coming from Sandy Brown, and a disputed goal from Sheffield. The final was the first to be filmed, and it contained the first referee decision demonstrated by film footage to be incorrect, as it showed that the ball did not cross the line for the Sheffield goal.
In the replay at <a href="Burnden%20Park">Burnden Park</a>, Bolton on 27 April 1901, Spurs won 3–1 with goals from Cameron, Smith and another by Brown. By winning the FA Cup, Spurs became the only <a href="non-League%20football">non-League</a> club to have achieved the feat since the formation of the Football League in 1888.

The win started a trend for Spurs' success in years ending in a one, with further FA Cup wins in <a href="1921%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1921</a>, <a href="1961%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1961</a>, <a href="1981%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1981</a> and <a href="1991%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1991</a>, the <a href="1971%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">League Cup in 1971</a>, the league in <a href="1950%E2%80%9351%20Football%20League">1951</a>, and in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20Football%20League">1961</a>, which is the <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29%23England">double</a> winning year. The club also inadvertently introduced the tradition of tying ribbons in the colours of the winning team on the FA Cup when the wife of a Spurs director tied blue and white ribbons to the handles of the cup.

Following the 1901 Cup win, Spurs failed to repeat the success in the next few seasons but they were runners-up in the Southern League twice, and won the <a href="London%20League%20%28football%29">London League</a> in the <a href="1902%E2%80%9303%20in%20English%20football">1902–03 season</a> as well as the Western League in the <a href="1903%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football">1903–04 season</a>. They went on their first overseas tour, to Austria and Hungary, in May 1905. Cameron left on 13 March 1907, citing "differences with the directorate", and he was replaced by <a href="Fred%20Kirkham%20%28football%20manager%29">Fred Kirkham</a> in April 1907. <a href="Billy%20Minter">Billy Minter</a> was signed in the <a href="1907%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">1907–08 season</a>; in 1919 he became the first player to score 100 goals for the club. Kirkham was disliked by players and fans alike, and he left on 20 July 1908 after a year as manager.

Tottenham resigned from the Southern League in 1908 and sought to join the Football League. Their initial application was unsuccessful, but after the resignation of <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke</a> from the league for financial reasons, Tottenham won election to the Second Division of the Football League for the <a href="1908%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football">1908–09 season</a> to replace them. As Spurs had no manager following Kirkham's departure, the directors took on the role of choosing the team, while the club secretary <a href="Arthur%20Turner%20%28Tottenham%20Hotspur%20football%20manager%29">Arthur Turner</a> was tasked with overseeing the team's affairs. Spurs played their first league game in September 1908 against <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> and won 3–0, their first ever goal in the Football League scored by <a href="Vivian%20Woodward">Vivian Woodward</a>. Woodward was also instrumental in the club's immediate promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> after finishing runners-up in their first year. Before the start of the following season, Woodward left football to pursue other interests, although he later returned to the game and joined <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>. Spurs struggled in their first year in the First Division, but avoided relegation by beating Chelsea in the last game of the season with goals from Billy Minter and a former Chelsea player <a href="Percy%20Humphreys">Percy Humphreys</a>, sending their opponents down instead.
The club started an ambitious plan to redevelop White Hart Lane, beginning in 1909 with the construction of the West Stand designed by <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a>. The North and South stands were built in the early 1920s, and the East Stand completed in 1934; the finished stadium had a capacity of almost 80,000. A bronze cockerel was placed atop the West Stand in 1909. The cockerel was adopted as an emblem because Harry Hotspur, after whom the club was named, was believed to be fond of <a href="Cockfight">cock-fighting</a>. Tottenham had initially used spurs as a symbol in 1900, as Harry Hotspur was said to have gained the nickname as he charged into battles by digging in his spurs to make the horse go faster, a symbol that evolved into a fighting cock.

In April 1912 <a href="Jimmy%20Cantrell">Jimmy Cantrell</a>, <a href="Bert%20Bliss">Bert Bliss</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Grimsdell">Arthur Grimsdell</a> arrived at the club. Late that year <a href="Peter%20McWilliam">Peter McWilliam</a> was appointed manager. He became a significant and popular figure at the club, managing the team in two separate periods, both interrupted by world wars. The first significant signing by McWilliam was winger <a href="Fanny%20Walden">Fanny Walden</a>, who was signed for a record £1,700 in April 1913, later signings included goalkeeper <a href="Bill%20Jaques">Bill Jaques</a> and right-back <a href="Thomas%20Clay">Tommy Clay</a>. McWilliam's record in the early years was poor, and Tottenham were bottom of the league at the end of the <a href="1914%E2%80%9315%20in%20English%20football">1914–15 season</a> when league football was suspended owing to the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> that had started a year earlier. During the war years, White Hart Lane was taken over by the government and turned into a factory for making gas masks, gunnery and protection equipment. The London clubs organised their own matches, and Tottenham played their home games at Arsenal's <a href="Arsenal%20Stadium">Highbury</a> and <a href="Leyton%20Orient%20F.C.">Clapton Orient</a>'s Homerton grounds.

When football resumed in 1919 the First Division was expanded from 20 to 22 teams. The Football League offered one of the additional places to 19th-placed Chelsea, who would otherwise have been relegated with Spurs for the <a href="1915%E2%80%9316%20in%20English%20football">1915–16 season</a>, and the other, controversially, to Arsenal, who had finished only sixth in Division Two the previous season. This decision cemented a bitter rivalry that continues to this day, a rivalry that had begun six years earlier when Arsenal relocated from <a href="Plumstead">Plumstead</a> to <a href="Highbury">Highbury</a>, a move opposed by Tottenham, who considered Highbury their territory, as well as by Clapton Orient and Chelsea.

In the first season after the war McWilliam took Tottenham straight back to Division One when they became <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Division Two</a> Champions of the <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20in%20English%20football">1919–20 season</a>. They won with what was then a league record of 70 points, losing only 4 games all season with 102 goals scored. Two players signed that season, <a href="Jimmy%20Dimmock">Jimmy Dimmock</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20Seed">Jimmy Seed</a>, became crucial members of the team together with Grimsdell. Other notable players of the period include Tommy Clay, <a href="Bert%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201892%29">Bert Smith</a> and <a href="Charlie%20Walters">Charlie Walters</a>. The following year Spurs reached their second <a href="1920%E2%80%9321%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> Final after beating Preston North End in the semi-final with two goals from Bliss. On 23 April 1921, in a game dominated by Walters, Spurs beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 1–0 in <a href="1921%20FA%20Cup%20Final">the final</a> at <a href="Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29">Stamford Bridge</a>, with 20-year-old Dimmock scoring the winning goal. They also won their first <a href="1921%20FA%20Charity%20Shield">Charity Shield</a>. Spurs players started to wear the cockerel emblem on their shirts in 1921, following their FA Cup victory that year.

At McWilliam's instigation a nursery club was established at <a href="Northfleet%20United%20F.C.">Northfleet</a> in about 1922, an arrangement that was formalised in 1931 and lasted until the Second World War. Thirty-seven Spurs players, nine of whom became internationals, started their playing career at Northfleet. They include <a href="Bill%20Nicholson%20%28footballer%29">Bill Nicholson</a>, <a href="Ron%20Burgess%20%28footballer%29">Ron Burgess</a>, <a href="Taffy%20O%27Callaghan">Taffy O'Callaghan</a>, <a href="Vic%20Buckingham">Vic Buckingham</a> and <a href="Ted%20Ditchburn">Ted Ditchburn</a>.

In the <a href="1921%E2%80%9322%20in%20English%20football">1921–22 season</a>, Spurs finished second to <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> in the league, their first serious challenge for the title. After the success of the two post-war seasons, Spurs only managed to finish mid-table in the next five. The team had begun to deteriorate, and new signings <a href="Jack%20Elkes">Jack Elkes</a> and <a href="Frank%20Osborne%20%28footballer%29">Frank Osborne</a> could not overcome weaknesses in other positions. They were in first place for a while in 1925, until Grimsdell broke his leg and they dropped down the table. McWilliam left for <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> in February 1927 when Middlesbrough offered him significantly better pay (and the Tottenham board had refused his request for a smaller increase). <a href="Billy%20Minter">Billy Minter</a>, who had first joined the club as a player in 1907, took over as manager, but his first full season in charge saw Spurs unexpectedly relegated at the end of the <a href="1927%E2%80%9328%20in%20English%20football">1927–28 season</a>. One factor may have been the sale of Jimmy Seed to <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>. Wednesday had looked certain to be relegated, but Seed helped them escape, beating Tottenham twice along the way, and they went on to win the League Championship title in each of the next two seasons.

Minter struggled to return Spurs to the top flight despite signing <a href="Ted%20Harper">Ted Harper</a>, a prolific goalscorer in the few years he was at the club, in February 1929. The stress of being manager affected Minter's health; he resigned and was given another position at the club in November 1929. <a href="Percy%20Smith%20%28English%20footballer%29">Percy Smith</a> was appointed manager at the start of 1930, and he strengthened the team with imported and home-grown talents including <a href="George%20Hunt%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201910%29">George Hunt</a>, <a href="Willie%20Hall%20%28English%20footballer%29">Willie Hall</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Rowe">Arthur Rowe</a>. The team, nicknamed the "Greyhounds", raced up the Second Division from near the bottom of the table in the <a href="1932%E2%80%9333%20in%20English%20football">1932–33 season</a>, and won promotion after finishing second to <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a>. Spurs only managed to stay in Division One for two seasons; injuries (especially to Rowe and Hall) left the team weakened and at the bottom of the table in the <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20in%20English%20football">1934–35 season</a> by April 1935. Smith then resigned, claiming that the club's directors had interfered with his team selection.

<a href="Jack%20Tresadern">Jack Tresadern</a> took over from caretaker manager <a href="Wally%20Hardinge">Wally Hardinge</a> in July 1935, but failed to lift the club out of the Second Division in the three years of his tenure. He promoted centre-forward <a href="Johnny%20Morrison%20%28footballer%29">Johnny Morrison</a> in place of fans' favourite George Hunt, and decided to sell Hunt to rival Arsenal in 1937, which made him unpopular. He left in April 1938 for <a href="Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.">Plymouth Argyle</a> when it became apparent that he would likely be sacked. Peter McWilliam was brought back as manager, and he tried to rebuild the team by promoting young players from Northfleet including Nicholson, Burgess and Ditchburn, but his second stint at the club was again interrupted by world war. Spurs also failed to advance beyond the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in the 1930s, getting that far three years running from 1935 to 1938. Despite Tottenham's lack of success in this period, 75,038 spectators still squeezed into White Hart Lane in March 1938 for a <a href="1937%E2%80%9338%20FA%20Cup">cup tie</a> against <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>—the club's largest gate until it was surpassed in 2016 when more than 85,000 attended the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2016–17 UEFA Champions League</a> home match against <a href="AS%20Monaco%20FC">Monaco</a> held at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>.

On 3 September 1939 <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a> declared war, and league football was abandoned with only three games played. Nevertheless, matches continued to be arranged and played during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. The London clubs first played in the <a href="Wartime%20League">Wartime League</a> and <a href="Football%20League%20War%20Cup">Football League War Cup</a>, and Spurs won the Regional League South 'C' in <a href="1939%E2%80%9340%20in%20English%20football">1940</a>. After a reorganisation in 1941, they also competed in the Football League South. Owing to the difficult wartime conditions, Spurs along with other London clubs refused to travel long distances for the matches drawn up by the Football League and decided to run their own competitions: London War League and London War Cup. They (eleven London clubs and five other clubs from the south) were temporarily expelled from the Football League; after paying a £10 fine they were readmitted, but they played in the Football League South in the way the London clubs had suggested. McWilliam went back to the North during the war and the team was managed by Arthur Turner; under him Spurs won the regional league twice. Charles Robert who had been chairman since 1898 died in 1943, and he was replaced by Fred Bearman. As it was difficult to field a full squad in the war years, many young players, among them <a href="Sonny%20Walters">Sonny Walters</a>, <a href="Les%20Medley">Les Medley</a>, <a href="Les%20Bennett">Les Bennett</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Willis">Arthur Willis</a>, gained their first playing experience for the club in this period. Spurs also shared White Hart Lane with Arsenal when Highbury was requisitioned by the government and used as an <a href="Air%20Raid%20Precautions%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Air Raid Precautions</a> centre.

After the war ended, McWilliam decided he was too old to return to the club, and <a href="Joe%20Hulme">Joe Hulme</a> was given the job of managing Tottenham. Hulme failed to win promotion for the club, although Spurs managed to stay in the top half of the Second Division for the three seasons he was manager, and they reached the semi-final of the <a href="1947%E2%80%9348%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup in 1948</a>. Players who joined the squad under Hulme include <a href="Eddie%20Baily">Eddie Baily</a>, <a href="Len%20Duquemin">Len Duquemin</a>, <a href="Harry%20Clarke%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201923%29">Harry Clarke</a> and <a href="Charlie%20Withers">Charlie Withers</a>. Football was popular in the post-war era, and although in the three post-war seasons during which Spurs languished in the Second Division, some games still drew large crowds, particularly for cup ties. Hulme was sacked after he rejected a suggestion to resign following an illness in March 1949.

In May 1949 Rowe became Spurs manager at a salary of £1,500 a year. He inherited the squad assembled by Hulme except for the one crucial signing he made when he took over, <a href="Alf%20Ramsey">Alf Ramsey</a>. Rowe introduced a new style of play that proved to be highly successful. He started his tenure as a Spurs manager in the <a href="1949%E2%80%9350%20in%20English%20football">1949–50 season</a> with a 4–1 victory at <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a>, the beginning of an unbeaten run of 23 League and Cup games between 27 August 1949 and 14 January 1950. The team secured promotion with six games yet to play, and won the Second Division convincingly by nine points, elevating them back into the top flight.

After a shaky start to their <a href="1950%E2%80%9351%20in%20English%20football">1950–51 season</a> when they were trounced 4–1 at home by the <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a> side of <a href="Stanley%20Matthews">Stanley Matthews</a>, Tottenham won eight consecutive games in October and November. They finished the season ahead of <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> by three points, having won their First Division Championship title in the penultimate game of the season by beating Sheffield Wednesday. That was Tottenham's first ever League title, and some considered the team that won it to be the best in Tottenham's history. The regular starting eleven of the season were Burgess (captain), Ramsey, Baily, Bennett, Medley, Withers/Willis, Clarke, Ditchburn, Duquemin, Walters and Nicholson.

The tactical style of play developed by Rowe that was successful in his early years as manager is known as "<a href="push%20and%20run">push and run</a>". Rowe credited McWilliam for learning to play a quick passing game, which he developed into a style involving players playing in triangles, quickly laying the ball off to a teammate and running past the marking tackler to collect the return pass. Keeping to Rowe's maxim of "make it simple, make it quick", this method proved an effective way of moving the ball at pace with players' positions and responsibilities being totally fluid. It became an attractive fast-moving attacking style of play regarded by Tottenham fans to be the Spurs Way, which was adjusted and perfected in the later period under Bill Nicholson. 

Spurs finished second in the <a href="1951%E2%80%9352%20in%20English%20football">1951–52 season</a>, beaten to the title by a young Manchester United team. A bad winter and the poor state of the White Hart Lane pitch were contributory, as the "push and run" style of play required a good firm playing surface. The following years witnessed a period of decline, as great players aged but younger players such as <a href="Tony%20Marchi">Tony Marchi</a> and <a href="Tommy%20Harmer">Tommy Harmer</a> were not yet experienced enough, and with injuries and other teams adapting to Spurs' revolutionary style of play, it meant a struggle for the once-dominant team. Spurs could only finish tenth in the <a href="1951%E2%80%9352%20in%20English%20football">1952–53 season</a>. The "push and run" team also started to disperse; Medley, Willis, Bennett and Burgess left to join other teams while Nicholson moved into coaching. In 1954 Rowe signed future captain <a href="Danny%20Blanchflower">Danny Blanchflower</a> for a club record fee of £30,000. Blanchflower won the <a href="FWA%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">FWA Footballer of the Year</a> twice while at Tottenham.

The stress of managing the team had affected Rowe's health, and he suffered a breakdown in 1954; he resigned after falling ill again the following year. Rowe's assistant and long-time club servant <a href="Jimmy%20Anderson%20%28football%20manager%29">Jimmy Anderson</a> stepped into the breach as manager, but the season ended with Spurs in the lower half of the table. With Blanchflower in the team, Ramsey was dropped from the line-up, and he soon left to start his managerial career with <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>, later guiding <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> to a <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a> win. Spurs were almost relegated at the end of the <a href="1955%E2%80%9356%20in%20English%20football">1955–56 season</a>, finishing just two points above the drop zone. In the <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20in%20English%20football">1956–57 season</a>, under the guidance of Bill Nicholson as coach, the creative pairing of Blanchflower and Harmer, and the scoring prowess of <a href="Bobby%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201933%29">Bobby Smith</a>, the club experienced a revival and finished in second place, albeit eight points behind the winners, the "<a href="Busby%20Babes">Busby Babes</a>" of Manchester United. Tottenham also fared well in the <a href="1957%E2%80%9358%20in%20English%20football">following season</a>, finishing third. As manager, Anderson started to build a new team by signing, bringing in or promoting some of the players who became members of the team that saw major success later: <a href="Cliff%20Jones%20%28Welsh%20footballer%29">Cliff Jones</a>, <a href="Terry%20Medwin">Terry Medwin</a>, <a href="Peter%20Baker%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201931%29">Peter Baker</a>, <a href="Ron%20Henry">Ron Henry</a>, <a href="Terry%20Dyson">Terry Dyson</a>, <a href="Maurice%20Norman">Maurice Norman</a> and Smith.

In October 1958, with the pressure of a poor start to the season and failing health, Anderson resigned, to be replaced by Bill Nicholson. Nicholson had joined Tottenham as an apprentice in 1936, and the following sixty-eight years saw him serve the club in every capacity from boot room to president. He became the most successful Spurs manager, guiding Tottenham to major trophy success three seasons in a row in the early 1960s: the <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a> in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">1961</a>, the FA Cup and <a href="European%20Champion%20Clubs%27%20Cup">European Cup</a> semi-final in 1962 and the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">Cup Winners' Cup</a> in <a href="1963%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">1963</a>.

In Nicholson's first game as manager, on 11 October 1958, Spurs beat Everton 10–4, their then record win, but the team finished 18th in the league in his <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20in%20English%20football">first season</a> in charge. In the following <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20in%20English%20football">1959–60 season</a>, Spurs improved to third place in the league, two points behind the champions <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a>. They also beat <a href="Crewe%20Alexandra%20F.C.">Crewe Alexandra</a> 13–2 in the <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20FA%20Cup">1959–60 FA Cup</a> with five goals coming from <a href="Les%20Allen">Les Allen</a>. It remains the highest scoring FA Cup tie of the 20th century and is still the club's record win. In his first two years in charge, Nicholson made several signings—<a href="Dave%20Mackay">Dave Mackay</a> and <a href="John%20White%20%28footballer%20born%201937%29">John White</a>, the two influential players of the Double-winning team, as well as Allen and goalkeeper <a href="Bill%20Brown%20%28goalkeeper%29">Bill Brown</a>.

The <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">1960–61 season</a> started with a 2–0 home win against Everton, the beginning of a run of eleven wins. The winning run was interrupted by a 1–1 draw against <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>, followed by another four wins before the unbeaten streak was broken by a loss to Sheffield Wednesday at <a href="Hillsborough%20Stadium">Hillsborough</a> in November. It remained the best ever start by any club in the top flight of English football until it was surpassed by Manchester City in 2017. The title was won on 17 April 1961 when Spurs beat the eventual runners-up Sheffield Wednesday at home 2–1, with three games still to play.

In this Double-winning season only seventeen players were used in all forty-nine league and cup games, three of them playing only once. The team was built around the quartet of Blanchflower, Mackay, Jones, and White; completing the side were Smith (top scorer of the season), Allen, Henry, Norman, Baker, Dyson and Brown, with Medwin, Marchi, and a young <a href="Frank%20Saul%20%28footballer%29">Frank Saul</a> among the reserves. Spurs reached the final of the <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20FA%20Cup">1960–61 FA Cup</a>, beating along the way Sunderland 5–0 in the sixth-round replay and Burnley 3–0 in the semi-final. Spurs met <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> in the <a href="1961%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1961 FA Cup Final</a> and won 2–0, helped in part by Leicester being effectively reduced to ten men owing to injury (no substitutions were allowed at that time). Spurs became the first team in England to win the Double in the 20th century, and the first since <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> achieved the feat in <a href="1896%E2%80%9397%20in%20English%20football">1897</a>.

Tottenham competed for the first time in a <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20in%20European%20football">European competition</a> in the <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20European%20Cup">1961–62 European Cup</a>. Their first opponents were <a href="G%C3%B3rnik%20Zabrze">Górnik Zabrze</a>, who beat Spurs 4–2. After the match the Polish press described Spurs players as "no angels"; in response, in the return leg at White Hart Lane, some Spurs fans dressed up as angels holding placards with slogans such as "Glory be to shining White Hart Lane", and other fans joined in by singing the refrains of "<a href="Glory%20Glory%20Hallelujah">Glory Glory Hallelujah</a>". Spurs won 8–1 to the sound of fans singing "Glory glory hallelujah, and the Spurs go marching on", which became an anthem for Tottenham from that night onwards. Spurs eventually lost in the semi-final to the holders <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a>, who went on to win the competition.

A month later Spurs won the FA Cup again after beating Burnley in the <a href="1962%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1962 FA Cup Final</a>. The first goal of the game was scored by <a href="Jimmy%20Greaves">Jimmy Greaves</a>, who was signed in December 1961 for £99,999 (so as not to be the first £100,000 player). Greaves became the top goal scorer for Tottenham with 220 league goals and 321 goals in all appearances for the club, and the most prolific scorer ever in the <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20first%20tier%20top%20scorers">top tier of English football</a>.

In the <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1962–63 European Cup Winners' Cup</a>, Spurs reached the final, beating <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> 8–4 on aggregate, <a href="%C5%A0K%20Slovan%20Bratislava">Slovan Bratislava</a> 6–2, and <a href="OFK%20Beograd">OFK Belgrade</a> 5–2 on aggregate. Spurs' 5–1 win in the <a href="1963%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">Cup Winners' Cup Final</a> against <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> in Rotterdam on 15 May 1963, during which <a href="Terry%20Dyson">Terry Dyson</a> scored a goal from 25 yards out, made Tottenham the first British team to win a European trophy.

By 1964 the Double-winning side was beginning to break up owing to age, injuries and transfers. Captain Danny Blanchflower hung up his boots that spring at the age of 38, troubled by a knee injury, and Dave Mackay was sidelined for a long period with his leg broken twice—the first occurred during Spurs' defence of the <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">Cup Winners' Cup</a> against Manchester United, resulting in the 10-men Spurs being eliminated from the competition. John White was tragically killed by lightning on a <a href="golf%20course">golf course</a> the summer of 1964. Nicholson rebuilt the team with new players, most of them imports, including <a href="Alan%20Mullery">Alan Mullery</a>, <a href="Pat%20Jennings">Pat Jennings</a>, <a href="Cyril%20Knowles">Cyril Knowles</a>, <a href="Mike%20England">Mike England</a>, <a href="Terry%20Venables">Terry Venables</a>, <a href="Jimmy%20Robertson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201944%29">Jimmy Robertson</a>, <a href="Phil%20Beal">Phil Beal</a>, <a href="Joe%20Kinnear">Joe Kinnear</a>, and <a href="Alan%20Gilzean">Alan Gilzean</a> who formed a goal-scoring partnership with Greaves. The rebuilding culminated in a win at the <a href="1967%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1967 FA Cup Final</a> over Chelsea with goals from wingers Robertson and Saul, and a third-place finish in the league.

The team failed to make much of an impact in the following two seasons, reaching only in <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20Football%20League%20Cup">1969</a> the semi-final of the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a>, a competition created in 1960 but one in which Tottenham did not participate until 1966. Mackay, Jones and Robertson left the club in 1968, followed by Venables in 1969. In their place came the home-grown players <a href="Steve%20Perryman">Steve Perryman</a>, <a href="Ray%20Evans%20%28footballer%29">Ray Evans</a> and <a href="John%20Pratt%20%28footballer%29">John Pratt</a>, and new signing <a href="Martin%20Chivers">Martin Chivers</a>. <a href="Martin%20Peters">Martin Peters</a> also arrived from <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> for a record fee of £200,000 in 1970, in part-exchange for a reluctant Greaves, while <a href="Ralph%20Coates">Ralph Coates</a> was signed in the summer of 1971 for £192,000 from <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a>. Gilzean recreated the goal-scoring partnership with Chivers that he had with Greaves, this time aided by the blindside runs of Peters. The revitalised team reached the <a href="1971%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">League Cup final</a> in 1971, where they beat Aston Villa 2–0 to win their first League Cup with Chivers scoring both goals. They won the League Cup again in 1973 after beating <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> by a single goal from Coates in the <a href="1973%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">final</a>.

The 1971 Cup win and a third-place finish in the <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20in%20English%20football">1970–71 season</a> earned Spurs a place in the inaugural <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>. They reached the final after a battling performance to draw against <a href="A.C.%20Milan">A.C. Milan</a> at the <a href="San%20Siro">San Siro</a> stadium, winning 3–2 on aggregate in the semi-final. In the first leg of the <a href="1972%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">UEFA Cup final</a> against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Chivers scored twice to give Spurs a 2–1 lead. In the return leg at White Hart Lane, team captain Mullery headed in a goal in his last game for the club to give Spurs a 3–2 win on aggregate. With this victory, Spurs became the first British team to win two different European trophies. In total Nicholson had won eight major trophies in sixteen years; his spell in charge was the most successful period in the club's history.

Although Tottenham managed to reach four cup finals in four years and winning three of them from 1971 to 1974, the team began to decline as Nicholson was unable to sign the players he wanted, in part because of his refusal to meet the demands for <a href="bribery">under-the-counter payments</a>. The early seventies was also the beginning of a period of increasing football violence; rioting by Spurs fans in <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> in their loss to <a href="Feyenoord">Feyenoord</a> in the <a href="1974%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">1974 UEFA Cup Final</a> added to his disillusionment. Nicholson resigned after a poor start to the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20in%20English%20football">1974–75</a> season and a 4–0 loss to Middlesbrough in the League Cup, but his tenure ended on a sour note. He had sought to be succeeded by Blanchflower as manager and <a href="Johnny%20Giles">Johnny Giles</a> as player-coach, but the chairman Sidney Wale was angered by Nicholson contacting the pair without informing him first. The club then severed all ties with a £10,000 payoff, even though Nicholson had wanted to stay on as an advisor, and refused him a <a href="Testimonial%20match">testimonial</a> (Nicholson was later brought back as advisor by Keith Burkinshaw and was only given a testimonial in 1983 under a different chairman).

<a href="Terry%20Neill">Terry Neill</a> was appointed manager by the board, and Spurs narrowly avoided relegation at the end of the 1974–75 season. Spurs performed better the following season, in which <a href="Glenn%20Hoddle">Glenn Hoddle</a> played his first game for the club. A former Arsenal player, Neill was never accepted by the fans, and he left to manage Arsenal in mid-1976, replaced by his assistant <a href="Keith%20Burkinshaw">Keith Burkinshaw</a> whom he had recruited the previous year.

In Burkinshaw's first year as manager in the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20in%20English%20football">1976–77</a> season, Tottenham slipped out of the First Division after 27 years in the top flight. Many of the early '70s Cup-winning team had by now left or retired. This was followed in the summer of 1977 by the sale of their <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Northern Ireland</a> international goalkeeper Pat Jennings for a bargain £45,000 to Arsenal as Burkinshaw had started to use <a href="Barry%20Daines">Barry Daines</a>, a move that shocked the club's fans and one that Burkinshaw later admitted was a great error. Jennings played on for another seven seasons for Spurs' arch-rivals.

Despite relegation, the board kept faith with Burkinshaw and the team immediately won promotion to the top flight, although it took until the final league game for them to be promoted. A sudden loss of form at the end of the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20in%20English%20football">1977–78</a> season meant the club needed a point in the last game at <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>. To Tottenham's great relief, the game ended 0–0 and Spurs returned to the First Division. Early in the season, Spurs had won 9–0 at home to <a href="Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.">Bristol Rovers</a>, with four of their goals coming from debutant striker <a href="Colin%20Lee">Colin Lee</a>. The glut of goals proved significant later on as Tottenham won promotion through goal difference.

In the summer of 1978, Burkinshaw caused a stir by signing for £750,000 two <a href="Argentina">Argentinian</a> internationals <a href="Osvaldo%20Ardiles">Osvaldo Ardiles</a> and <a href="Ricardo%20Villa">Ricardo Villa</a>—players from beyond the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a> in English football were rare at the time. This was also a period of rebuilding as young players were brought in from the youth team, such as <a href="Mark%20Falco">Mark Falco</a>, <a href="Paul%20Miller%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201959%29">Paul Miller</a>, <a href="Chris%20Hughton">Chris Hughton</a> and <a href="Micky%20Hazard">Micky Hazard</a>, as well as other players signed from other clubs such as <a href="Graham%20Roberts">Graham Roberts</a>, <a href="Tony%20Galvin">Tony Galvin</a>, and in particular the twin strike force of <a href="Garth%20Crooks">Garth Crooks</a> and <a href="Steve%20Archibald">Steve Archibald</a>.

Spurs opened the 1980s by reaching the <a href="1981%20FA%20Cup%20Final">100th FA Cup Final</a> in 1981 against Manchester City, and won the replay 3–2 in a match notable for the winning goal from Ricardo Villa. They lifted the FA Cup again the next season, beating Queens Park Rangers in the <a href="1982%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1982 Final</a>. Although they were also in contention for three other trophies that season, they finished fourth in the First Division, lost to Liverpool in the <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> final in extra time, while <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> won at home in the <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">Cup Winners' Cup</a> semi-final after a 1–1 draw at White Hart Lane.

The club began a new phase of redevelopment at White Hart Lane in 1980, starting with the rebuilding of the West Stand initiated by a new chairman Arthur Richardson. The West Stand was demolished and a new stand, which took 15 months to complete, opened in 1982. Cost overruns on the project, which rose from £3.5 million to £6 million, as well as the cost of rebuilding the team in the return to Division One resulted in financial difficulties for the club. Property developer and Spurs fan <a href="Irving%20Scholar">Irving Scholar</a> began buying up shares in the club. He took advantage of a rift in the boardroom between Richardson and former chairman Sidney Wale, and persuaded Wale to sell his shares. Scholar bought up 25% of the club for £600,000, and with the help of Paul Bobroff who had bought 15% of shares from the family of previous chairman Bearman, took control in December 1982. Scholar inherited a club in debt to the tune of nearly £5 million, what was then the largest debt in English football, but a <a href="rights%20issue">rights issue</a> after he took over brought in a million pounds. In 1983, a new holding company, Tottenham Hotspur <a href="Public%20limited%20company">plc</a>, was formed with the football club run as a subsidiary of the company. With a valuation of £9 million, the company was <a href="Flotation%20%28shares%29">floated</a> on the <a href="London%20Stock%20Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a>, the first sports club to do so. Together with <a href="Martin%20Edwards">Martin Edwards</a> of Manchester United and <a href="David%20Dein">David Dein</a> of Arsenal, Scholar transformed English football clubs into business ventures that applied commercial principles to the running of the clubs to maximise their revenues, a process that eventually led to the formation of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>.

In 1984, Spurs won the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> after beating <a href="R.S.C.%20Anderlecht">Anderlecht</a> on penalties in the <a href="1984%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">final</a>, the third of the major trophies won by the club under Burkinshaw in the 1980s. Several weeks before this victory, Burkinshaw announced that he would be leaving at the end of that season after disagreements with the directors and becoming disenchanted with the club.

Burkinshaw was succeeded as manager by his assistant <a href="Peter%20Shreeves">Peter Shreeves</a> in June 1984. According to Scholar, <a href="Aberdeen%20F.C.">Aberdeen</a> manager <a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Alex Ferguson</a>, who joined Manchester United two years later, had reneged on an agreement to take over. Tottenham enjoyed a strong start to the 1984–85 season and looked poised to win the league title by the winter, but a series of poor home results in 1985 resulted in the team being leapfrogged by eventual champions Everton and runners-up Liverpool. Their final position of third place in the league should have secured them a UEFA Cup place, but the <a href="Heysel%20disaster">Heysel disaster</a> on 29 May 1985, which saw 39 spectators crushed to death when Liverpool fans rioted at the <a href="1985%20European%20Cup%20Final">1985 European Cup Final</a>, resulted in all English clubs being banned from European competitions. Perryman departed in 1986 after 19 years at the club (17 years in the first team) and a record 655 league appearances. Also in 1986, the club training ground at <a href="Cheshunt">Cheshunt</a> that Spurs had owned since 1952 was sold for over £4 million. Although <a href="Chris%20Waddle">Chris Waddle</a> and <a href="Paul%20Allen%20%28footballer%29">Paul Allen</a> were signed, the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Football%20League">1985–86 season</a> proved disappointing, and Shreeves was sacked at the end of the season.

<a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a> manager <a href="David%20Pleat">David Pleat</a> was appointed the new manager following Shreeves' dismissal. For much of <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20in%20English%20football">1986–87</a>, Spurs played with what was for that time an unusual five-man midfield <a href="Formation%20%28association%20football%29">formation</a>: Hoddle, Ardiles, Allen, Waddle and <a href="Steve%20Hodge">Steve Hodge</a>. The lone striker <a href="Clive%20Allen">Clive Allen</a> scored 49 goals in all competitions that season, still a club record. Tottenham remained in contention for all three major domestic honours throughout the season, though finished empty-handed. In the League Cup, Tottenham lost to eventual competition winners Arsenal in the semi-final. Spurs also missed out on the First Division title to Everton, and stumbled to a 3–2 loss in the <a href="1987%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup final</a> to <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry City</a>, whose winning goal was deflected off <a href="Gary%20Mabbutt">Gary Mabbutt</a>'s knee as an own goal in the final minutes. The close season of 1987 saw the sale of Glenn Hoddle to <a href="AS%20Monaco%20FC">Monaco</a> after a decade as the driving force in Tottenham's midfield.

In October 1987, Pleat quit the club following allegations about his private life. He was succeeded by former player <a href="Terry%20Venables">Terry Venables</a>, who had by then built up an impressive managerial record. He inherited a Spurs side that was struggling in the league with a quarter of the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20in%20English%20football">1987–88 season</a> played. Earlier in the season veteran goalkeeper <a href="Ray%20Clemence">Ray Clemence</a> had to retire after suffering an <a href="Achilles%20tendon">Achilles tendon</a> injury, and new signings by Venables <a href="Terry%20Fenwick">Terry Fenwick</a> and <a href="Paul%20Walsh">Paul Walsh</a> failed to lift the team, which only managed a 13th-place finish. Striker Clive Allen was also less prolific in attack in this season, and he was sold to French club <a href="FC%20Girondins%20de%20Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> in March 1988.

To invigorate the Tottenham side, Venables paid a national record £2 million for Newcastle midfielder <a href="Paul%20Gascoigne">Paul Gascoigne</a> in June 1988, and also signed striker <a href="Paul%20Stewart%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201964%29">Paul Stewart</a> from Manchester City for £1.7 million. Spurs made a shaky start to the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">1988–89 season</a>; incomplete refurbishment of the East Stand caused the postponement of the opening game against <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry</a> just a few hours before kickoff, which earned the club a two-point deduction (later replaced by a £15,000 fine), followed by a string of losses in October. They were second from bottom at the end of October but improving to ninth place by the turn of 1989 and finishing sixth in the final table.

By the end of the 1980s and the beginning of 1990s, Spurs had become mired in considerable financial difficulties, with a debt reported to be £20 million in 1991. The East Stand was refurbished in 1989 but its cost had doubled to over £8 million, while the company's attempts to diversify into other businesses such as the clothing firms <a href="Hummel%20International">Hummel UK</a> and Martex failed to generate the income expected and were in fact losing them money. July 1989 saw the arrival at White Hart Lane of England striker <a href="Gary%20Lineker">Gary Lineker</a> from Barcelona for a fee of £1.2 million; however, the cash-strapped club was unable to pay Barcelona in full even though Waddle was sold days later to <a href="Olympique%20de%20Marseille">Marseille</a> for £4.25 million. Scholar had to organise a secret £1.1 million loan from <a href="Robert%20Maxwell">Robert Maxwell</a>, which caused an uproar and resulted in an attempt to oust Scholar from the boardroom when it was revealed. Maxwell, who first owned <a href="Oxford%20United%20F.C.">Oxford United</a> and then <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a>, became interested in the club, putting Derby County up for sale so that he could acquire Tottenham. Venables, who had previously attempted to buy the club but failed, then joined forces with businessman <a href="Alan%20Sugar">Alan Sugar</a> in June 1991 to forestall a takeover by Maxwell and gain control of Tottenham Hotspur plc, buying out Scholar for £2 million.

With Lineker and Gascoigne in the team, Spurs finished third in the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20in%20English%20football">1989–90</a> title race won by Liverpool. In the following <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20in%20English%20football">1990–91 season</a>, they began the season unbeaten in ten games, but failed to rediscover their earlier league form in the second half of the season, eventually finishing tenth in the final table. Despite the middling ranking, this season remains a highlight for Tottenham for their performances in the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20FA%20Cup">1990–91 FA Cup</a>. A 3–1 semi-final win over Arsenal featured a 30-yard free kick from Gascoigne considered to be one of the best goals ever seen in the competition. In the <a href="1991%20FA%20Cup%20Final">final</a> against <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>, Gascoigne suffered serious <a href="cruciate%20ligament">cruciate ligament</a> damage in his knee when he made a reckless tackle on opponent <a href="Gary%20Charles">Gary Charles</a>. Winning the match 2–1 after extra time, Spurs became the first team to collect eight FA Cups, a record later surpassed by Manchester United in 1996. The excitement in North London over the win also had the unexpected result of prompting Sugar, who had little knowledge of the club's history (and was alleged to have asked "What Double?" when someone mentioned Tottenham's Double), to contact Venables and jointly buy the club.

Gascoigne was a transfer target for Italian club <a href="S.S.%20Lazio">Lazio</a>, but his knee injury (aggravated later in a nightclub incident) meant that he missed the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20in%20English%20football">1991–92 season</a>, and his transfer to Lazio was put on hold. By the summer of 1992, his knee had recovered and he completed his move to Lazio for £5.5 million, reduced from the £7.9 million fees agreed before his injury. Gary Lineker then announced in November that he would be leaving Spurs at the end of the season to play in Japan, while Paul Walsh and Paul Stewart also left the club.

In the 1991–92 season, Venables became chief executive of the club, and Shreeves again took charge of first-team duties. During the summer of 1992, Venables decided to return to team management; Shreeves was sacked, and a European style of management was instituted with <a href="Doug%20Livermore">Doug Livermore</a> the head coach and Clemence the assistant. Although Sugar and Venables began as equal partners with each investing £3.25 million in the club, Sugar's financial clout allowed him to increase his stake to £8 million in December 1991, thereby gaining control of the club. In May 1993, after a row at a board meeting, Terry Venables was controversially dismissed from the Tottenham board by Sugar, whose decision was overturned in the <a href="High%20Court">High Court</a> but reversed on appeal. Despite being initially seen as a saviour of the club, the ousting of a popular figure, later aggravated by a perceived lack of investment in the club, earnt Sugar long-lasting animosity from some fans who repeatedly called for his resignation.

Spurs were one of the five clubs that pushed for the founding of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, created with the approval of <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> to replace the Football League First Division as the highest division of English football. To coincide with the massive changes in English football, Tottenham made major signings, including winger <a href="Darren%20Anderton">Darren Anderton</a>, defender <a href="Neil%20Ruddock">Neil Ruddock</a>, and striker <a href="Teddy%20Sheringham">Teddy Sheringham</a> for what was then a club record £2.1 million from Nottingham Forest. The Sheringham transfer was later the subject of allegations of "<a href="Bribery">bungs</a>" against Forest manager <a href="Brian%20Clough">Brian Clough</a>. In the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Premier%20League">first ever Premier League season</a>—Venables' final year as Spurs' manager—Spurs finished eighth. Teddy Sheringham was the division's top scorer with 22 goals, 21 of which were scored for Tottenham.

The departure of Venables saw Tottenham return to a conventional management setup after two seasons of a two-tier structure. Former player Osvaldo Ardiles took charge of the first team. In the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">1993–94 season</a>, Sheringham's injury in October 1993 impacted on Spurs' performance, and relegation became a real possibility. In the end, the club managed a 15th-place finish, its survival only guaranteed by a win in the penultimate game of the season. By this time Spurs had come under investigation for financial irregularities alleged to have taken place in the 1980s while Irving Scholar was chairman, and in June 1994 the club was found guilty of making illegal payments to players. Spurs were fined £600,000, had twelve league points deducted for the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Premier%20League">1994–95 season</a> and were banned from the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20FA%20Cup">1994–95 FA Cup</a>. Following an appeal the number of points deducted was reduced, but the fine was increased to £1.5 million. A further arbitration (after Sugar threatened to sue the FA) quashed the points deduction and FA Cup ban, although the fine remained in place.

Despite the penalty, the club aimed to have a successful season in 1994–95, and signed three players who had appeared at that <a href="1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">summer's World Cup</a>: German striker <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Klinsmann">Jürgen Klinsmann</a> and two Romanians, <a href="Ilie%20Dumitrescu">Ilie Dumitrescu</a> and <a href="Gheorghe%20Popescu">Gheorghe Popescu</a>. <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29">Forward players</a> in Spurs line-up already included Sheringham, Anderton and <a href="Nick%20Barmby">Nick Barmby</a>, and Ardiles chose to play five attacking players, dubbed the "Famous Five" of Klinsmann, Sheringham, Anderton, Barmby, and Dumitrescu. Their debut in the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">1994–95 season</a> against Sheffield Wednesday in August 1994, which Spurs won 4–3, was described as a "breathtaking exhibition of football", but the imbalance in the team also leaked goals (33 in 15 games). Spurs struggled in September with a series of defeats, and after the team lost 3–0 in the League Cup in October, Ardiles was dismissed. At that time Spurs were just two places above the relegation zone, although they would have been 11th in the table with the deducted points that were later restored.

Ardiles was replaced by <a href="Gerry%20Francis">Gerry Francis</a>, who alleviated relegation fears and oversaw the club's climb to seventh place in the league, just missing out on a <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20UEFA%20Cup">1995–96 UEFA Cup</a> place. When the FA Cup ban was lifted, Spurs reached the FA Cup semi-final where they were defeated 4–1 by eventual winners Everton. Klinsmann was top scorer at the club with twenty-nine in all competitions, but he felt that Spurs would not be able to challenge for the title in future seasons, and returned to his homeland to sign with <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>. Barmby, Dumitrescu and Popescu also departed, and Francis signed the likes of <a href="Ruel%20Fox">Ruel Fox</a> and <a href="Chris%20Armstrong%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201971%29">Chris Armstrong</a> for more than £4 million each but spurned the chance to sign <a href="Dennis%20Bergkamp">Dennis Bergkamp</a> who was a fan of the club and was interested in joining Spurs. Other signings include future captain <a href="Ledley%20King">Ledley King</a> who did not start in the first team for a few years. Francis' transfer dealings failed to deliver European qualification or higher, and Spurs finished eighth in 1996 and tenth in 1997. Sheringham left in the summer of 1997 for Manchester United while <a href="Les%20Ferdinand">Les Ferdinand</a> joined the team for a record £6 million and <a href="David%20Ginola">David Ginola</a> for £2.5 million from Newcastle. Ferdinand was soon hit by injury, and in November 1997, Francis decided to resign after Spurs were beaten 4–0 by Liverpool.
<a href="Christian%20Gross">Christian Gross</a>, coach of Swiss champions <a href="Grasshopper%20Club%20Z%C3%BCrich">Grasshoppers</a>, was chosen as the successor to Francis. Gross failed to turn around the club's fortunes in the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">1997–98 season</a>, and the team battled against the drop for the remainder of the campaign. Klinsmann returned to Spurs in December on loan, and four goals in a 6–2 win away to Wimbledon in the penultimate game of the season was enough to secure survival. By the end of the season, the renovation of the White Hart Lane stadium was completed. White Hart Lane was converted into an all-seater stadium in the 1990s, the South Stand was rebuilt, and a new tier added to the North Stand, leaving the stadium with a capacity of about 36,240. The stadium remained in this form bar some minor changes until 2016.

After losing two of the first three games of the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">1998–99 season</a>, Gross was sacked, and former Arsenal manager <a href="George%20Graham%20%28footballer%29">George Graham</a> was hired to take over. Graham signed <a href="Steffen%20Freund">Steffen Freund</a>, who became a fans' favourite, as well as <a href="Tim%20Sherwood">Tim Sherwood</a>. Fans were critical of Graham due to his association with Arsenal and disliked his defensive style of football, especially when <a href="Arsene%20Wenger">Arsene Wenger</a> was starting to achieve major success at Arsenal with an attacking football style previously associated with Spurs. Nevertheless, in Graham's first season as Spurs manager, 1998–99, the club secured a mid-table finish and won the <a href="1999%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">League Cup</a>. In the final against <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>, full-back <a href="Justin%20Edinburgh">Justin Edinburgh</a> was sent off after an altercation with <a href="Robbie%20Savage">Robbie Savage</a>, but the ten-men Spurs secured a dramatic victory through <a href="Allan%20Nielsen">Allan Nielsen</a>'s diving header in the 93rd minute of the game. To cap a good season, David Ginola won both the <a href="PFA%20Players%27%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">PFA Players' Player of the Year</a> and <a href="Football%20Writers%27%20Association%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year</a> awards in <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">the year</a> Manchester United won the <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29">Treble</a>.

The club finished mid-table the following year. In May 2000, Tottenham signed Ukrainian striker <a href="Sergei%20Rebrov">Sergei Rebrov</a> from <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Kyiv">Dynamo Kyiv</a> for a club record £11 million. But Rebrov was not a success at White Hart Lane, managing just ten goals over the next four seasons.

In late 2000, Sugar decided to sell his share holding in the club, a decision he blamed on the hostility of fans towards him and his family, and stepped down as chairman in February 2001. 27% of his 40% share holding in Tottenham were sold for £22m to <a href="ENIC%20Group">ENIC Sports PLC</a> in 2001, with the rest sold in 2007 for £25m. ENIC, owned by <a href="Joe%20Lewis%20%28British%20businessman%29">Joe Lewis</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Levy%20%28Tottenham%20Hotspur%29">Daniel Levy</a> with Levy responsible for the running of the club, would eventually acquire 85% of Tottenham. The club was transferred into its private ownership in 2012. A month after Levy took over as chairman, George Graham was sacked as manager for alleged breach of contract by vice-chairman David Buchler after Graham commented on the financial position of Spurs.

Team management passed to former Tottenham player <a href="Glenn%20Hoddle">Glenn Hoddle</a>, who took over in the final weeks of the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">2000–01 season</a> from caretaker manager David Pleat. His first game was a defeat to Arsenal in the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20FA%20Cup">2001 FA Cup</a> semi-final. That summer, club captain <a href="Sol%20Campbell">Sol Campbell</a> joined Arsenal on a <a href="Bosman%20ruling">Bosman</a> <a href="free%20transfer%20%28soccer%29">free transfer</a>. The loss of a transfer fee by Spurs, the move to their bitterest rivals, and the perceived underhanded fashion in which he negotiated his move (claimed to be a record £100,000 per week) led to long-term enmity towards Campbell from Spurs fans. Hoddle turned to more experienced players in the shape of Teddy Sheringham who returned to Spurs in May 2001, as well as new signings <a href="Gus%20Poyet">Gus Poyet</a> and <a href="Christian%20Ziege">Christian Ziege</a>. Spurs played some encouraging football in the opening months of his management, but they ended the <a href="FA%20Premier%20League%202001%E2%80%9302">2001–02 season</a> in ninth place. They reached the <a href="2002%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">League Cup final</a>, where they lost to Blackburn, despite being seen as the favourites after their 5–1 defeat of Chelsea in the previous round.

The only significant outlay before the following campaign was the £7 million signing of <a href="Robbie%20Keane">Robbie Keane</a>, who joined from <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>. <a href="Jamie%20Redknapp">Jamie Redknapp</a> also joined earlier on a free transfer. The <a href="FA%20Premier%20League%202002%E2%80%9303">2002–03 season</a> started well, with Tottenham top of the league after three successive wins, and Hoddle voted manager of the month in the division for August. They were still in the top six as late as early February, but the season ended with a tenth-place finish, the result of a barren final ten games of the league campaign that delivered a mere seven points. Several players publicly criticised Hoddle's management and communication skills. In the following <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20FA%20Premier%20League">2003–04 season</a>, Spurs started the season poorly, gaining only four points out of six games. With Spurs struggling third from bottom at the table, Hoddle was sacked by Levy, and Pleat again took over as caretaker manager.

In June 2004, Tottenham appointed French team manager <a href="Jacques%20Santini">Jacques Santini</a> as head coach, with <a href="Martin%20Jol">Martin Jol</a> as his assistant and <a href="Frank%20Arnesen">Frank Arnesen</a> as sporting director. In early November, after only 13 games in charge, Santini decided to quit the club, making his the shortest stint by any Spurs manager. Santini was replaced by Jol, and the team managed to secure a ninth-place finish in the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">2004–05 season</a>. In June 2005, when Arnesen moved to Chelsea, Spurs appointed <a href="Damien%20Comolli">Damien Comolli</a> as sporting director. Among the players signed by Jol were <a href="Edgar%20Davids">Edgar Davids</a> in 2005, <a href="Dimitar%20Berbatov">Dimitar Berbatov</a> in 2006, and <a href="Gareth%20Bale">Gareth Bale</a> in May 2007. Players who left included <a href="Michael%20Carrick">Michael Carrick</a>, who went to Manchester United in 2006.

During the <a href="FA%20Premier%20League%202005%E2%80%9306">2005–06 season</a>, Spurs spent six months in the top four. Going into the final game of the season, they led Arsenal by a point, but were defeated in their final match—away to West Ham—after many players including Keane and Carrick succumbed to <a href="food%20poisoning">food poisoning</a> from a meal they had the night before. Spurs were pipped to a <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> place, but gained a place in the UEFA Cup and achieved their highest finish for 16 years. In <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">2006–07</a>, they finished fifth for the second-straight year.
The <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">2007–08 season</a> saw the club win only one of their first ten League matches, their worst start in 19 years. Jol was sacked, learning of his removal just before a Uefa Cup game on 25 October 2007. <a href="Juande%20Ramos">Juande Ramos</a>, formerly of <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a>, then replaced the Dutchman as manager. Captained by Ledley King, Spurs went on to win the League Cup, beating Chelsea 2–1 in the <a href="2008%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">League Cup Final</a> in February 2008. <a href="Luka%20Modri%C4%87">Luka Modrić</a> was signed towards the end of the season, but Berbatov and Keane were sold to Manchester United and Liverpool respectively in the summer as both wanted to leave. Tottenham made their worst start to a season in the club's history in <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">2008–09</a>, their failure to register a win in eight League games leaving them bottom of the Premier League. Ramos and Director of Football Damien Comolli were dismissed on 25 October 2008, amid Levy's criticism of the failure to recruit suitable replacements for Berbatov and Keane.

Portsmouth manager <a href="Harry%20Redknapp">Harry Redknapp</a> was appointed as Ramos' replacement, and Tottenham reverted to a traditional setup with Redknapp responsible for both coaching and player transfers. Redknapp took the club out of the relegation zone by winning 10 out of the 12 points available in his first two weeks in charge, and finished the 2008–09 campaign eighth in the league table. The January transfer window saw the return of Keane and <a href="Jermain%20Defoe">Jermain Defoe</a> to the club after spells at Liverpool and Portsmouth respectively, later joined by <a href="Peter%20Crouch">Peter Crouch</a> signed in the summer, and <a href="Rafael%20van%20der%20Vaart">Rafael van der Vaart</a> in 2010.
The team's performance improved in the two following seasons. Notable matches in the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">2009–10 season</a> include the 9–1 home win against <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a>, with Defoe scoring five, a record win in the top flight for the club, and a 2–1 against Arsenal, with goals from Bale and debutant <a href="Danny%20Rose%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201990%29">Danny Rose</a>, giving them their first Premier League victory against their rivals. Spurs finished the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20in%20English%20football">2009–10 season</a> in fourth place, and reached the qualifying rounds of the Champions League for the first time in their history. In the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">2010–11 season</a>, they qualified for the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20group%20stage">group stages</a> of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a>, came top of their group and went on to beat <a href="A.C.%20Milan">A.C. Milan</a> 1–0 on aggregate in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20phase">knock-out</a> stage. At the quarter-finals, Spurs suffered a heavy defeat against <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> after Crouch was sent off early in the game, and the 10-men team was beaten 4–0 at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a>, and 5–0 on aggregate. Earlier in the season they won at the <a href="Emirates%20Stadium">Emirates</a> with goals from van der Vaart and Bale, their first win at Arsenal in 17 years.

At the start of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">2011–12 season</a>, the home league game to Everton was cancelled because of <a href="2011%20England%20riots">rioting in Tottenham</a> a week before the game, and Spurs then lost the next two games. Tottenham managed to record ten wins and one draw in their next eleven Premier League matches, and finished the season in fourth place in the Premier League but failed to qualify for the Champions League. On 13 June 2012, after brief contract renewal talks during which Redknapp and the Tottenham board failed to agree terms, Redknapp left the club.

Following Redknapp's departure, the club appointed former Chelsea and <a href="FC%20Porto">Porto</a> coach <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Villas-Boas">André Villas-Boas</a> as manager. Shortly after his appointment, the club pipped Liverpool for the signature of <a href="Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.">Swansea City</a> midfielder <a href="Gylfi%20Sigur%C3%B0sson">Gylfi Sigurðsson</a>. Several days later, the club also resolved the protracted transfer saga surrounding <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a> defender <a href="Jan%20Vertonghen">Jan Vertonghen</a>. They were soon followed by <a href="Hugo%20Lloris">Hugo Lloris</a> and <a href="Mousa%20Demb%C3%A9l%C3%A9%20%28Belgian%20footballer%29">Mousa Dembélé</a>, while Modric left for Real Madrid. In the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">2012–13 season</a>, they finished fifth. Despite winning a dramatic match against <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> with a goal from Gareth Bale in the final match of the season, Arsenal won their last match to take the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2013–14 Champions League</a> spot, and Spurs dropped to the Europa League for the second successive season. In their concurrent <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2012–13 Europa League</a> campaign, they were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Swiss side <a href="FC%20Basel">Basel</a> on penalties.

At the beginning of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">2013–14 season</a>, Bale moved to Real Madrid in what was then a world record transfer fee of €100.8 million (£85.1 million). This money paid for several players signed in that transfer window, including <a href="Christian%20Eriksen">Christian Eriksen</a> and <a href="Erik%20Lamela">Erik Lamela</a>. Following a 6–0 defeat against Manchester City and a 5–0 defeat against Liverpool, André Villas-Boas was dismissed from his role on 16 December 2013. A week later, former Spurs player Tim Sherwood became Villas-Boas' replacement as manager, but only as a stopgap measure. Although Sherwood led Spurs to a sixth-place finish in the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, his results against the top teams were disappointing, and he was sacked on 13 May 2014.

<a href="Mauricio%20Pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a> was appointed Tottenham manager on 27 May 2014, on a five-year contract. In his first season Spurs finished fifth in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Premier%20League">2014–15 Premier League</a> with 64 points, and were runners-up in the <a href="2015%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">2015 Football League Cup Final</a>. Pochettino chose to promote young players, and in his second season in charge, Spurs had the youngest team in the Premier League. A new generation of players that included <a href="Harry%20Kane">Harry Kane</a>, <a href="Dele%20Alli">Dele Alli</a>, and <a href="Eric%20Dier">Eric Dier</a> were all aged 22 or younger that season. Spurs had a much improved <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">2015–16 season</a>, but their title challenge ended with a 2–2 draw at Stamford Bridge on 2 May 2016, and they finished third behind winners Leicester. The following <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">2016–17 season</a> began with a series of 12 unbeaten league matches, but the team performed inconsistently during the first half of the season. They put in a much better performance in 2017, including a win in the <a href="North%20London%20derby">North London derby</a> that ensured a higher finish in the Premier League than their rivals Arsenal for the first time in 22 years. Their early inconsistency meant that Spurs were unable to overhaul the lead of the eventual champions Chelsea in the league table (13 points over Spurs at one stage in March), and finished the season in second place with 86 points, their highest ever points tally since the Premier League began. This is their highest ranking in 54 years since the <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20in%20English%20football">1962–63 season</a> under Bill Nicholson, and the team also achieved their first unbeaten home run in 52 years since the <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20in%20English%20football">1964–65 season</a>.
The construction of a new stadium was initiated at White Hart Lane in 2015, and scheduled to be completed in time for the 2018–19 season. The new stadium has a seating capacity of 62,062, considerably greater than the old stadium's 36,000. A section of the North Stand was removed to allow building work on the new stadium to proceed next to the old stadium. The removal of part of the stand reduced the capacity of the stadium, and European matches were held at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> for the 2016–17 season to comply with the ticketing requirement for European games. A club attendance record of 85,512 spectators was reported for the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2016–17 UEFA Champions League</a> game against <a href="Bayer%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a>, which Spurs lost 1–0. Spurs played their last game at White Hart Lane on 14 May 2017, a 2–1 victory over Manchester United that secured their second place in the Premier League.

In the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">2017–18 season</a> all Tottenham's home games were played at Wembley, as White Hart Lane had been demolished for the rebuilding. As the stadium has a higher capacity, this season saw a series of record attendances for Premier League games, the highest at the North London Derby on 10 February 2018 when 83,222 spectators witnessed Spurs' 1–0 win over Arsenal. Tottenham failed to make any new signings in the summer transfer window of 2018, the first club not to do so in the Premier League. They nevertheless had their best start in the Premier League in the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">2018–19 season</a>, ended by a home defeat against Manchester City.

The Monster (novella)

The Monster is an <a href="1898%20in%20literature">1898</a> <a href="novella">novella</a> by American author <a href="Stephen%20Crane">Stephen Crane</a> (1871–1900). The story takes place in the small, fictional town of Whilomville, New York. An <a href="African%20American">African-American</a> <a href="coachman">coachman</a> named Henry Johnson, who is employed by the town's physician, Dr. Trescott, becomes horribly disfigured after he saves Trescott's son from a fire. When Henry is branded a "monster" by the town's residents, Trescott vows to shelter and care for him, resulting in his family's exclusion from the community. The novella reflects upon the 19th-century social divide and ethnic tensions in America.

The fictional town of Whilomville, which is used in 14 other Crane stories, was based on <a href="Port%20Jervis%2C%20New%20York">Port Jervis, New York</a>, where Crane lived with his family for a few years during his youth. It is thought that he took inspiration from several local men who were similarly disfigured, although modern critics have made numerous connections between the story and the 1892 <a href="Lynching%20in%20the%20United%20States">lynching</a> in Port Jervis of an African-American man named <a href="Robert%20Lewis%20%28lynching%20victim%29">Robert Lewis</a>. A study of prejudice, fear, and isolation in a rather small town, the novella was first published in "<a href="Harper%27s%20Magazine">Harper's Magazine</a>" in August 1898. A year later, it was included in "The Monster and Other Stories"—the last collection of Crane's work to be published during his lifetime.

Written in a more exact and less dramatic style than two of his previous major works ("" and "<a href="The%20Red%20Badge%20of%20Courage">The Red Badge of Courage</a>"), "The Monster" differs from the other Whilomville stories in its scope and length. Its themes include the paradoxical study of monstrosity and deformity, as well as race and tolerance. While the novella and collection received mixed reviews from contemporary critics, "The Monster" is now considered one of Crane's best works.

Crane began writing "The Monster" in June 1897 while living in <a href="Oxted">Oxted</a>, England with his longtime partner <a href="Cora%20Crane">Cora Taylor</a>. Despite his previous success—"The Red Badge of Courage" had gone through 14 printings in the United States and six in England—Crane was running out of money. To survive financially, he worked at a feverish pitch, writing prolifically for both the English and the American markets. He later remarked that he wrote "The Monster" "under the spur of great need", as he desperately required funds. In August of that year, Crane and Cora were injured in a carriage accident while visiting friend <a href="Harold%20Frederic">Harold Frederic</a> and his mistress Kate Lyon in Homefield, <a href="Kenley">Kenley</a>; after a week of recuperation, they followed the couple on vacation to Ireland, where Crane finished the story.
"The Monster" was Crane's first story to feature the fictional town of Whilomville; it would eventually serve as the setting of 14 stories, 13 of which would appear in the 1900 anthology "Whilomville Stories". The town was based on <a href="Port%20Jervis%2C%20New%20York">Port Jervis, New York</a>, where the author lived from the age of six to eleven. Although Crane and his mother relocated to <a href="Asbury%20Park%2C%20New%20Jersey">Asbury Park, New Jersey</a> in 1880, until 1896 he frequently stayed with his older brother and Port Jervis resident <a href="William%20Howe%20Crane">William Howe Crane</a>. Crane admitted to his publishers that while he readily used Port Jervis as inspiration while writing "The Monster", he was anxious to ensure that the residents of his previous hometown did not recognize themselves in the fictional Whilomville. While Crane biographer <a href="Thomas%20Beer">Thomas Beer</a> claimed to trace the prototype of Henry Johnson to a Port Jervis <a href="teamster">teamster</a> named Levi Hume, Crane's niece, Edna Crane Sidbury, believed the character and his disfigurement were influenced by a local waste collector whose face was damaged by cancer. In "Black Frankenstein: The Making of an American Metaphor", author Elizabeth Young theorized that Crane may also have been inspired by popular <a href="freak%20show">freak show</a> attractions such as <a href="Zip%20the%20Pinhead">Zip the Pinhead</a>, whose real name was William Henry Johnson, and <a href="Joseph%20Merrick">Joseph Merrick</a>, the Elephant Man. It is also possible that Crane found thematic inspiration in <a href="Henrik%20Ibsen">Henrik Ibsen</a>'s "<a href="An%20Enemy%20of%20the%20People">An Enemy of the People</a>"; although first published in 1882, the play—about a physician who finds himself ostracized by his community—first became popular in the United States in the mid-1890s.

Modern critics have connected the novella's themes of racial division to a violent episode in Port Jervis' history. On June 2, 1892, an African-American man named <a href="Robert%20Lewis%20%28lynching%20victim%29">Robert Lewis</a> was <a href="Lynching%20in%20the%20United%20States">lynched</a> for allegedly assaulting a local white woman. On his way to the Port Jervis jail, Lewis was set upon by a mob of several hundred white men who dragged him through the town, beat him and hanged him from a tree. William Howe Crane lived within sight of where the lynching took place and was one of the few men, together with the chief of police, who attempted to intervene. Although Stephen Crane was not present, there were detailed accounts published in both the "Port Jervis Gazette" and the "<a href="New-York%20Tribune">New-York Tribune</a>", and Crane contributed to the "Tribune" at the time. The "Gazette" marked the day of Lewis' lynching as "one of the most disgraceful scenes that was ever enacted in Port Jervis", and activist <a href="Ida%20B.%20Wells">Ida B. Wells</a> launched a campaign to investigate the murder as well as the widespread theory that Lewis was set up. Of the 1,134 reported lynchings throughout the United States between 1882 and 1899, Lewis was the only black man to be lynched in New York.

Crane initially sent his manuscript of more than 21,000 words to "<a href="McClure%27s">McClure's</a>", along with several other works including "<a href="The%20Bride%20Comes%20to%20Yellow%20Sky">The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky</a>", but it remained unpublished for nearly a year. After "McClure's" eventual rejection, "The Monster" appeared in the August 1898 issue of "<a href="Harper%27s%20Magazine">Harper's Magazine</a>" with illustrations by <a href="Peter%20Newell">Peter Newell</a>. A year later, it was published in the United States by <a href="Harper%20%28publisher%29">Harper & Brothers Publishers</a> in a collection titled "The Monster and Other Stories", which included two other works by Crane, "<a href="The%20Blue%20Hotel">The Blue Hotel</a>" and "<a href="His%20New%20Mittens">His New Mittens</a>". The first British edition, which added an additional four stories, was published in 1901.

After being admonished by his father, Dr. Ned Trescott, for damaging a <a href="peony">peony</a> while playing in his family's yard, young Jimmie Trescott visits his family's coachman, Henry Johnson. Henry, who is described as "a very handsome negro", "known to be a light, a weight, and an eminence in the suburb of the town", is friendly toward Jimmie. Later that evening Henry dresses smartly and saunters through town—inciting catcalls from friends and ridicule from the local white men—on his way to call on the young Bella Farragut, who is extremely taken with him.

That same evening, a large crowd gathers in the park to hear a band play. Suddenly, the nearby factory whistle blows to alert the townspeople of a fire in the second district of the town; men gather hose-carts and head toward the blaze that is quickly spreading throughout Dr. Trescott's house. Mrs. Trescott is saved by a neighbor, but cannot locate Jimmie, who is trapped inside. Henry appears from the crowd and rushes into the house in search of the boy, finding him unharmed in his bedroom. Unable to retreat the way he came, Henry carries Jimmie, wrapped in a blanket, to the doctor's laboratory and the hidden stairway that leads outside. He discovers the fire has blocked this way out as well and collapses beside Dr. Trescott's desk. A row of nearby jars shatters from the heat, spilling molten chemicals upon Henry's upturned face.
Dr. Trescott returns home to find his house ablaze; after he is told by his hysterical wife that Jimmie is still inside, he rushes into the house by way of the laboratory's hidden passageway. He finds Jimmie still wrapped in the blanket and carries him outside. Hearing that Henry is inside the house, Dr. Trescott attempts to re-enter, but is held back. Another man goes into the house and returns with the badly burned "thing" that used to be Henry Johnson. The injured men and boy are taken to Judge Denning Hagenthorpe's house across the street to be treated, but while it is thought that Dr. Trescott and Jimmie will survive their injuries, Henry is pronounced as good as dead; he is mourned as a hero by the town.

Henry Johnson survives, however, under the watchful eye of Dr. Trescott, who treats the injured man out of gratitude for saving his son's life. Hagenthorpe, a leading figure in town, urges Trescott to let Henry die, stating that he "will hereafter be a monster, a perfect monster, and probably with an affected brain. No man can observe you as I have observed you and not know that it was a matter of conscience with you, but I am afraid, my friend, that it is one of the blunders of virtue." Ultimately Trescott decides to move Henry, who has sustained disfiguring injuries to his face and psyche, to a local negro household, but Henry's presence proves troubling for the family's well-being, and he is moved to another. One night Henry absconds, visiting various people around town and leaving terrified neighbors in his wake, including Bella Farragut, who he attempts to court as if no time has passed since they last met. Not welcome anywhere else, Henry is eventually moved to the carriage-house in the newly built Trescott home. Despite Dr. Trescott's protection, Henry is branded a monster by the townspeople, who avoid the Trescotts as a result. Although previously Henry's friend, Jimmie now mocks him, daring his friends to approach the disfigured man. Once the leading doctor in Whilomville, Trescott's reputation suffers greatly, as does that of his wife, who no longer receives visitors.

The story is told from the point of view of a selectively <a href="Narration%23Third-person%2C%20omniscient">omniscient narrator</a> who seemingly chooses whether or not to divulge plot points as they occur, causing "a pattern of expectation" on the part of the reader. Although the novella is separated into 24 chapters, some critics—among them Charles B. Ives, Thomas Gullason and Marston LeFrance—believe these chapters are further divided into two parts: chapters 1–9 lead up to Henry's injury, whereas chapters 10–24 map the town's response. Critic David Halliburton wrote in his 1989 book "The Color of the Sky: A Study of Stephen Crane" that "The Monster" displayed a more "chastened" and exact style than Crane's earlier works, which were often a mixture of clever bawdiness and epic dramatics—both of which are seen respectively in "" and "<a href="The%20Red%20Badge%20of%20Courage">The Red Badge of Courage</a>".

Edwin H. Cady believed "The Monster" is the best indication of the writer Crane may have become had he lived longer, showcasing a style that is "technically proficient, controlled, and broadly insightful." "The Monster" relies heavily on Crane's signature use of imagery and symbolism. Frequent images and metaphors dealing with sight appear several times in the story, especially in regard to the townspeople's lack of vision, both literally and morally. The townspeople are similarly depicted using imagery of either animals or machines, characterizing them as both bestial and mindless. Color imagery is also prevalent. For example, fire—both literal and symbolic—features prominently throughout the story. While critics as early as Edward Garnett in 1921 pointed to Crane's heavy use of irony in "The Monster", other critics such as Michael D. Warner question whether Crane intended the story to be read as ironic, or if this is the result of the author's "oddly contradictory attitude toward his characters."

In his introduction to 1921's "Men, Women and Boats", one of the first Crane anthologies, <a href="Vincent%20Starrett">Vincent Starrett</a> noted the difference in tone between "The Monster" and the 14 other tales that Crane set in the fictional Whilomville. He wrote, "The realism is painful; one blushes for mankind. But while this story really belongs in the volume called "Whilomville Stories", it is properly left out of that series. The Whilomville stories are pure comedy, and "The Monster" is a hideous tragedy." Critic William M. Morgan noted the stories' similar fascination with "pure animal spirits" and "meanings of boyhood", but differentiated "The Monster" focus on "a larger, more mature, and modernizing community." Paul Sorrentino also pointed to the style differences, noting the story's focus on the adult characters rather than the children, as well as the overall length of the story; at more than 21,000 words, it dwarfs the other Whilomville tales. However, there is disagreement among critics as to whether "The Monster" should be considered a short story or a novella. Crane called it a "novelette", and the <a href="Library%20of%20America">Library of America</a> edition refers to it as a novella.

The question of morality plays a large role in "The Monster", especially in terms of compassion and tolerance. Several critics have pointed to the novella's non-absolute stance on these themes, mainly in regard to Dr. Trescott's <a href="ethical%20dilemma">ethical dilemma</a> in his devotion to Henry, a black man and his son's savior. As author Patrick Dooley points out, "What is at stake in "The Monster" is that if Trescott is a moral man, Crane has rejected common-sense morality. If Trescott's actions are <a href="Supererogation">supererogative</a> and saintly, however, he is to be applauded and admired, but the ordinary moral behavior of average people and the competence of everyday heroes will not have been expunged." Crane scholar Stanley Wertheim also noted the duplicitous morality depicted by the town of Whilomville, which exhibits "prejudice, fear and isolation in an environment traditionally associated with neighborliness and goodwill."

Various critics have written about the story's paradoxical themes of deformity and monstrosity. Not only does Henry Johnson suffer a literal and physical defacement that brands him a monster, but the Trescotts' suffer metaphorical loss of face when they are cast out by society. The <a href="trope%20%28literature%29">trope</a> of monstrosity takes on a second meaning when it becomes clear that the townspeople's actions make them more monstrous than the man they shun for his deformity; as professor and critic Lee Clark Mitchell asked in his essay, "Face, Race, and Disfiguration in Stephen Crane's 'The Monster, "Is 'the monster' the disfigured black man or is it the town that comes to dis-figure him?" Similarly, <a href="Harold%20Bloom">Harold Bloom</a> called "The Monster" an example of the "invasion myth", made worse by the fact that the "monster" is born from within the townspeople's collective mind. Henry-the-monster is therefore "generated by its fears of social instability, its prejudices about appearance (including racism), and its all-consuming passion for gossip and drama." Trescott, the only man in town not to see Henry as an invader, also becomes ostracized by the frenzied small-town mentality.

Race is a polarizing theme throughout the story. As William M. Morgan wrote, while the white characters are largely depicted as cold and humorless, and the black characters as warm and amusing, the town's racial hierarchy is omnipresent. Slavery is referred to several times throughout the story, as critic Nan Goodman noted; as a post-<a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> work, "The Monster" revisits slavery's legacy, as well as its effects on modern African Americans like Henry Johnson. At the beginning of the story, it is made clear that the white townspeople tolerate Henry because he "behaves himself" and "knows his place" as a black man. Later, when Henry struggles through the burning house to save Jimmie, it is said that "he was submitting, submitting because of his fathers, bending his mind in a most perfect slavery to this conflagration." However, while his suffering is central to the story, Henry Johnson is never really fleshed out as a character; before the fire, he "strikes in quick succession the minstrel's poses of an old-time, happy-go-lucky Negro", who charms children and women alike. Despite his heroism, Morgan stated, Henry does not stray far from a racial stereotype. Critics such as Lillian Gilkes and John R. Cooley have noted Crane's lack of racial sensitivity while writing "The Monster", although they note that the author was simply exhibiting "unconscious racism" in order to fulfill literary conventions of the late 19th century. In his 2002 essay, "Blunders of Virtue: The Problem of Race in Stephen Crane's 'The Monster, John Clemen sums up the critics' tendency to either "ignore the evidence of Crane's racism, to dismiss it as a cultural influence irrelevant to his larger purposes, or to reconfigure it within his irony in such a way as to enable the story and its author to achieve an unintended racial insight."

"The Monster" received mixed to positive reviews from contemporary critics. Before its publication, Crane's friend <a href="Joseph%20Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a> wrote while responding to a partial draft: "the damned story has been haunting me ... I think it must be fine." <a href="William%20Dean%20Howells">William Dean Howells</a>, an early champion of Crane, proclaimed the novella to be "the greatest short story ever written by an American". "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>" concluded that "The Monster" alone would have cemented Crane's literary reputation; its reviewer wrote, "If Mr. Crane had never written anything else, he would have earned the right of remembrance by this story alone."

The reviewer for "The Critic" dismissed it as "an unpleasant story ... There is humor in the telling, but it is humor of a rather grim character." <a href="Julian%20Hawthorne">Julian Hawthorne</a>, son of author <a href="Nathaniel%20Hawthorne">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a>, also ultimately disliked the novella, calling it "an outrage on art and humanity". He did, however, point to the similarities between Crane's "monster" and <a href="Victor%20Frankenstein">Victor Frankenstein</a>'s creation in <a href="Mary%20Shelley">Mary Shelley</a>'s most famous work, stating that Crane, like Shelley before him, successfully depicted an innocent outsider being tormented by townspeople who are themselves made monstrous by their irrational fears. Other critics have since echoed the comparison between Shelley's character and Henry Johnson; Elizabeth Young explained the parallels in that, similar to "Frankenstein" narrative—in which "a male body is hideously transformed in a scientist's laboratory and brought back by the scientist from the dead—Johnson's disfigurement takes place in a doctor's laboratory, and it is Trescott that ultimately saves him.

"The Monster and Other Stories" was the last collection of Crane's work to be published during his lifetime. In the mid-20th century, the novella received a resurgence of critical attention, especially in regard to studies of race relations in late 19th-century New York. Critic Chester L. Wolford wrote that the story "reveals truths not socially accepted for almost another hundred years. The story is, indeed, an excoriation of social conditions for the blacks, but more important ... it is an excoriation of all communities, all societies, in all places and all times." African-American author <a href="Ralph%20Ellison">Ralph Ellison</a> called "The Monster", alongside <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a>'s "<a href="Adventures%20of%20Huckleberry%20Finn">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</a>", "one of the parents of the modern American novel". In a 1999 article, critic James Nagel stated that "no other work of short fiction in the decade was more important thematically, and nothing until <a href="William%20Faulkner">William Faulkner</a>'s "The Bear" so enriched the genre of the United States. Screenwriter and director <a href="Albert%20Band">Albert Band</a> adapted Crane's novella for the 1959 film "Face of Fire", starring <a href="Cameron%20Mitchell%20%28actor%29">Cameron Mitchell</a> as Dr. Trescott and <a href="James%20Whitmore">James Whitmore</a> as Johnson. Unlike in the original story, Johnson was depicted as white, and his first name was changed from Henry to Monk.

Xixiasaurus

Xixiasaurus () is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="troodontid">troodontid</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> that lived during the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> <a href="Period%20%28geologic%20time%29">Period</a> in what is now China. The only known specimen was discovered in <a href="Xixia%20County">Xixia County</a>, <a href="Henan%20Province">Henan Province</a>, in central China, and became the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> of the new genus and <a href="species">species</a> Xixiasaurus henanensis in <a href="2010%20in%20paleontology">2010</a>. The names refer to the areas of discovery, and can be translated as "Henan Xixia lizard". The specimen consists of an almost complete skull (except for the hindmost portion), part of the lower jaw, and teeth, as well as a partial right forelimb.

"Xixiasaurus" is estimated to have been long and to have weighed . As a troodontid, it would have been bird-like and lightly built, with grasping hands and an enlarged sickle-shaped claw on the second toe. Its skull was long, with a long, low snout that formed a tapering U-shape when seen from below. The of the forehead was dome-like in side view, which indicates it had an enlarged . It differed from other troodontids in that the front of the of the lower jaw was down-turned. Unlike in most troodontids, the teeth of "Xixiasaurus" did not have ; instead, their (front and back edges) were smooth and sharp. It was distinct among troodontids in having 22 teeth in each (in other genera the maxillary tooth count was either higher or lower).

The precise relationships of "Xixiasaurus" with other troodontids are uncertain, but it had some similarities with "<a href="Byronosaurus">Byronosaurus</a>". Though troodontids with unserrated teeth were once thought to form a <a href="clade">clade</a>, the taxonomic significance of this feature has been questioned. Troodontids had large brains, keen senses, and were probably agile. There has been debate about their diet, with some researchers arguing that they were carnivorous, and others that they were <a href="omnivorous">omnivorous</a> or herbivorous. The lack of serrated teeth in "Xixiasaurus" and some other troodontids indicates these were herbivorous, as they had lost the ability to slice meat. "Xixiasaurus" is known from the <a href="Majiacun%20Formation">Majiacun Formation</a>, the exact age of which is uncertain. These <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a>s were deposited by <a href="braided%20streams">braided streams</a> and <a href="meandering%20streams">meandering streams</a>, and are noted for containing abundant <a href="dinosaur%20eggs">dinosaur eggs</a>.

The <a href="holotype%20specimen">holotype specimen</a> (catalogued as HGM 41HIII−0201 in Henan Geological Museum, <a href="Zhengzhou">Zhengzhou</a>) was discovered near Songgou Village, which is in the northeast region of <a href="Xixia%20County">Xixia County</a>, in <a href="Henan%20Province">Henan Province</a> of central China. This area of the <a href="Xixia%20Basin">Xixia Basin</a> <a href="outcrop">exposes</a> the <a href="Majiacun%20Formation">Majiacun Formation</a>. In <a href="2010%20in%20paleontology">2010</a>, the specimen was described as the new <a href="genus">genus</a> and <a href="species">species</a> "Xixiasaurus henanensis" by the palaeontologist <a href="L%C3%BC%20Junchang">Lü Junchang</a> and colleagues. The <a href="Generic%20name%20%28biology%29">generic name</a> refers to Xixia County coupled with "saurus", meaning "lizard", while the <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> refers to Henan Province. The full name can be translated as "Henan Xixia lizard". Remains of <a href="troodontids">troodontids</a> are very rare compared to those of other small <a href="theropod">theropod</a> <a href="dinosaurs">dinosaurs</a> (only thirteen troodontid <a href="taxa">taxa</a> were known at the time "Xixiasaurus" was named), and have mainly been found in Asia.

The holotype specimen is the only known "Xixiasaurus" fossil, and consists of an almost complete skull except for the hindmost portion, as well as a partial right forelimb. The connection between the (forehead bone) and (bone running at the upper length of the snout) bones is displaced, and part of the is missing. Most of the snout is preserved, with the of the right side being well-preserved. Only the front part of the left (tooth-bearing bone of the mandible) and some of its broken teeth are preserved. Though several teeth are missing from both jaws, their original number can be determined in the upper jaw, since their sockets there are preserved. The forelimb (of which all preserved parts are ) consists of the middle part of the and (bones of the lower arm), the extremity of the second and third (hand bones), the complete first finger, and the first of the second finger. In 2014, the palaeontologist Takanobu Tsuihiji and colleagues stated that a bone Lü and colleagues had originally identified as the (part of the ) of "Xixiasaurus" was instead part of the or (the main bones of the upper jaw), based on comparison with the vomer of the more complete troodontid "<a href="Gobivenator">Gobivenator</a>".

"Xixiasaurus" is estimated to have been around long, and to have weighed about . Since the nasal bones of the holotype specimen were not fused, it may not have been a mature individual. As a troodontid <a href="maniraptoran">maniraptoran</a>, it would have been bird-like, lightly built, with <a href="raptorial">raptorial</a> (grasping) hands and an enlarged sickle-shaped claw on the hyper-extendible second toe. Fossils of other troodontids, such as "<a href="Jianianhualong">Jianianhualong</a>", show that members of the group were covered in <a href="pennaceous%20feathers">pennaceous feathers</a>, with long feathers on the arms and legs, and frond-like feathering on the tail (similar to the <a href="avialan">avialan</a> "<a href="Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx</a>").

The skull of "Xixiasaurus" was long, similar to that of "<a href="Byronosaurus">Byronosaurus</a>" overall, and the snout was distinctly long and low. The premaxillae were not fused to each other, and bore a few small pits on their side surfaces. When viewed from below, the front margin of the upper jaw formed a tapering U-shape, distinct from the shape in other troodontids; the U-shape tapered less in "Byronosaurus" and was very elongated in "<a href="Sinornithoides">Sinornithoides</a>", for example. Viewed from above, the nasal <a href="Process%20%28anatomy%29">processes</a> that extended hindwards from the premaxillae were wedged between the premaxillary processes of the nasal bones, which extended forwards. The nasal process of the premaxilla ended at the level of the hind margin of the external (bony nostril), and was quadrangular in <a href="Cross%20section%20%28geometry%29">cross-section</a> rather than triangular, as in "Byronosaurus". The nasal process of the premaxilla formed the upper hind corner of the narial opening, and "Xixiasaurus" was distinct in having an opening on the side surface at the base of the nasal process. The <a href="suture%20%28anatomy%29">suture</a> between the premaxilla and maxilla curved upwards from the front of the snout, and straightened out under the narial opening when seen from the side. The maxillary process of the premaxilla tapered hindwards and wedged between a small forwards-extended process of the maxilla and the main part of that bone. The maxilla was kept from being part of the margin of the narial opening by the maxillary process. The maxillary process of the premaxilla extended hindwards to the same level as the nasal process. Due to not being fused together, the premaxillae had a fissure along their lower midline. There were two small openings (connected to each other by a shallow groove) near the base of the third and fourth premaxillary teeth, but none near the first and second.

The maxilla was much longer than high, forming most of the skull's side surface, and to the front, most of the lower margin of the narial opening. The narial opening was roughly oval, with its long axis (the longest stretch from its front to the back) being parallel with the lower margin of the maxilla. The side surface of the maxilla below the narial opening was covered with small pits and <a href="foramina">foramina</a> (openings), as in "Byronosaurus", and the row of these was just above and parallel to the margin of the tooth-row. The side surface of the maxilla had three large, elongated openings, called the anterior, maxillary, and . The anterior fenestra appears to have been entirely enclosed by the maxilla, and there were two rows of small pits below it. The back of the maxillary fenestra had a bony wall called the interfenestral bar, which separated it from the antorbital fenestra, as in "Byronosaurus". The antorbital fenestra (the largest of the three openings, located in front of the orbit) was rectangular in side view, and the part of the maxilla below it was low and did not have small foramina, unlike the front part. The maxillary teeth were placed along most of the lower margin of the antorbital fenestra. On the lower side, the maxilla formed an extensive internal shelf which contributed to a large (which separated the nasal airways from the mouth), extending backwards from the contact with the premaxilla. The front part of the palatal shelf had three small openings, and there was a row of (which allowed blood to supply the bone with nutrients) in a groove just above and parallel to the tooth row margin. 

The nasal bones were elongated, long and wide. They were not fused together, and covered the top of the (snout) for most of their length. At the front, the nasal formed the boundary at the lower back of the narial opening. The nasal sloped downwards at the front, whereas it flattened hindwards. The frontal bones were long, and were not fused. Each frontal was triangular when viewed from above, and as in other troodontids, the frontals were widest at the point where they contacted the (bone behind the eye socket). The frontal was overlapped by the nasal and (bone in front of the eye socket) at the middle front, and its frontmost part contacted the hind end of the nasal. Seen from the side, the hind part of the frontal was dome-like, which indicates that "Xixiasaurus" had an enlarged braincase. The rim of the (eye socket) was raised, with weak notches along the margins. The lacrimal bone was T-shaped in side view; its front process was very long and reached the hind margin of the antorbital fenestra, forming most of the latter's upper hind border, as in "Byronosaurus".

It differed from other troodontids in that the front end of the dentary of the lower jaw was downturned, similar to what is seen in <a href="therizinosaurian">therizinosaurian</a> theropods. The (the area where the two halves of the mandible connected at the front) was short, and this region was slightly curved towards the middle. Two rows of foramina ran along the outer side of the dentary, just below the first seven dentary teeth (only one of the rows continued hindwards past the seventh of these teeth). The foramina lay in a groove, which is a distinct feature of troodontids, while the inner surface of the dentary was smooth. A narrow, deep ran at the inner side of the dentary, just above its lower margin, towards the front of the mandibular symphysis. Just behind the symphysis and below the Meckelian groove, a distinct foramen was present, similar to the condition in "<a href="Urbacodon">Urbacodon</a>". On the outer side of the dentary, at the level of the Meckelian groove, there was a shallow groove with elongated pits.

Unlike most troodontids, "Xixiasaurus" did not have on its teeth, and their (front and back edges) were instead smooth and sharp, as in "Byronosaurus". "Xixiasaurus" had four closely packed teeth in each premaxilla, as in most other theropods, with roughly oval (tooth-sockets). The premaxillary teeth were smaller than the hindmost teeth of the maxilla. There was a distinct constriction between the crown and root of the premaxillary and frontmost ten maxillary teeth. The inner surfaces of the premaxillary tooth crowns were convex and the outer surfaces were somewhat concave, which created a D-shape when viewed in cross-section, a feature shared with a few other troodontids. It was distinct among troodontids in having 22 teeth in each maxilla (though not all teeth were preserved in the holotype, their number can be determined from the alveoli); other genera had either a higher or lower maxillary tooth count than "Xixiasaurus". The first seven maxillary teeth were tightly packed and much smaller than those further back, and had distinct constrictions between their crowns and roots. The outer surfaces of the crowns had distinct grooves close to the carinae, similar to "Urbacodon". The teeth curved backwards and were compressed from side to side, and the bases of the crowns were less expanded behind the tenth maxillary tooth. As in "Byronosaurus", the maxillary teeth were (differentiated), with the fifteenth tooth being largest.

The radius bone of the lower arm was much thinner than the ulna. The third metacarpal was thinner than the second, and their outermost edges were at the same level, which indicates these two metacarpals were equal in length. The claw of the first finger was sharp, and had a large flexor <a href="tubercle">tubercle</a> (where a <a href="tendon">tendon</a> was inserted). The first phalanx of the first finger was long, and the first phalanx of the second was .

Lü and colleagues assigned "Xixiasaurus" to the <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Troodontidae based on its high tooth-count, constriction between the crowns and roots of the teeth, close packing of teeth near the tip of the dentary, and distinct groove for the neurovascular foramina on the dentary. They found "Xixiasaurus" to be most closely related to "Byronosaurus" of Mongolia, and suggested the two may have formed a <a href="clade">clade</a> with "Urbacodon" from Uzbekistan consisting of troodontids with unserrated teeth, which <a href="Evolutionary%20radiation">radiated</a> across Asia (while noting that serrations had been lost <a href="independent%20evolution">independently</a> in different groups of theropods). A 2012 <a href="phylogenetic%20analysis">phylogenetic analysis</a> by the paleontologist Alan H. Turner and colleagues instead found "Xixiasaurus" to belong in a clade with "<a href="Sinovenator">Sinovenator</a>" and "<a href="Mei%20%28dinosaur%29">Mei</a>" (both also from China), due to sharing a maxillary process of the premaxilla that separated the maxilla from the nasal behind the narial opening. In 2016, the palaeontologists Alexander Averianov and <a href="Hans-Dieter%20Sues">Hans-Dieter Sues</a> did not identify a clade formed of troodontids with unserrated teeth, but found them to be successive <a href="sister%20taxa">sister taxa</a> to a more <a href="derived%20%28phylogenetics%29">derived</a> (or "advanced") clade of troodontids with serrated teeth. They suggested that the D-shaped cross-section of the premaxillary teeth could be one possible feature uniting "Xixiasaurus", "Byronosaurus", and "Urbacodon".

The following <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> shows the position of "Xixiasaurus" within Troodotidae according to a 2017 analysis by the palaeontologist Caizhi Shen and colleagues:

Troodontids have mainly been discovered in the <a href="northern%20hemisphere">northern hemisphere</a>, largely restricted to Asia and North America. They appear to have reached their greatest diversity during the <a href="Campanian">Campanian</a> stage of the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> in Asia. Troodontids probably originated in Asia, and if genera such as "<a href="Anchiornis">Anchiornis</a>" are considered part of the family, it would have evolved by the <a href="Early%20Jurassic">Early Jurassic</a>. Troodontids are grouped in the clade <a href="Paraves">Paraves</a>, along with <a href="dromaeosaurids">dromaeosaurids</a> and birds. Troodontids and dromaeosaurids have also been grouped together in the clade <a href="Deinonychosauria">Deinonychosauria</a>, based on the shared sickle-claw on their hyper-extendible second toe, but some studies have found troodontids to be more closely related to birds than to dromaeosaurids.

Troodontids had some of the highest <a href="encephalization%20quotient">encephalization quotient</a>s (a measure of the ratio between actual brain size and the brain size predicted from body size) among non-<a href="Bird">avian</a> dinosaurs. As suggested by their large eye-sockets and well-developed <a href="middle-ear">middle-ear</a>s, they appear to have had keen senses. They also had proportionately long legs, which indicates they were agile. Due to their large brains, possible <a href="stereoscopic%20vision">stereoscopic vision</a>, grasping hands, and enlarged sickle-claws, troodontids were generally assumed to have been predatory. In 1998, the palaeontologist <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Holtz">Thomas R. Holtz</a> and colleagues pointed out that the serrations on the teeth of troodontids were different from those of typical, carnivorous theropods in their large size and wide spacing, which is similar to the condition in <a href="herbivore">herbivorous</a> dinosaurs (including <a href="Therizinosauridae">therizinosaurid</a> theropods) and lizards rather than carnivorous dinosaurs. They suggested that this difference in coarseness may be related to the size and resistance of plant and meat fibres, and that troodontids may have been herbivorous or <a href="omnivorous">omnivorous</a>. They also pointed out that some features that had been interpreted as predatory adaptations in troodontids were also found in herbivorous and omnivorous animals, such as <a href="primates">primates</a> and <a href="raccoons">raccoons</a>.

In 2001, the palaeontologists <a href="Philip%20J.%20Currie">Philip J. Currie</a> and <a href="Dong%20Zhiming">Dong Zhiming</a> rejected the idea that troodontids could have been herbivorous. They stated that troodontid anatomy was consistent with a carnivorous lifestyle, and pointed out that the structure of their serrations was not much different from those of other theropods. They noted that troodontid features such as sharply pointed serrations that curved up towards the tip of the teeth, razor sharp <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a> between the serrations, and at the bases, were not seen in herbivorous dinosaurs, which had simpler, cone shaped serrations. Lü and colleagues discussed the previous studies of troodontid diet, and suggested that the loss of serrations in the teeth of "Xixiasaurus" and some other troodontids was related to a change in their diet. Since the teeth would appear to have lost their typical ability to slice meat, at least these trodontids may therefore have been either herbivorous or omnivorous. In 2015, the palaeontologist Christophe Hendrickx and colleagues suggested that <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> (or "primitive") troodontids with unserrated teeth were herbivorous, whereas more derived troodontids with serrated teeth were carnivorous or omnivorous.

"Xixiasaurus" is known from the mid-lower part of the Majiacun Formation of China, which dates to the Late Cretaceous <a href="Period%20%28geologic%20time%29">period</a>, but there has been disagreement about the exact geological age of the formation. Lü and colleagues suggested the formation dated to the Campanian <a href="Geological%20age">age</a>, based on the similarity between "Xixiasaurus" and the Campanian genus "Byronosaurus". A <a href="Cenomanian">Cenomanian</a> to <a href="Turonian">Turonian</a> age for the formation had earlier been suggested based on spores, pollen, and <a href="dinosaur%20eggs">dinosaur eggs</a>; a <a href="Coniacian">Coniacian</a> to <a href="Santonian">Santonian</a> age has been suggested as well, and Coniacian to Campanian or Santonian to <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> ages have been suggested based on <a href="bivalve">bivalve</a> fossils. Some studies have also suggested that the formation is as old as <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a>. The Majiacun Formation is represented by an thick layer of brown and red <a href="sandstones">sandstones</a>, with muddier intervals of purple to green, or brown to red. The lower and middle units of the formation are composed of sandstone, <a href="siltstone">siltstone</a>, and <a href="mudstone">mudstone</a>. Eggs and eggshells are often found in the muddy siltstones.

The formations of the Xixia Basin are thought to be of continental origin (due to the absence of marine fossils), probably deposited by rivers and within lakes. The Majiacun Formation itself is interpreted as representing deposits of <a href="braided%20streams">braided streams</a> and <a href="meandering%20streams">meandering streams</a>. The formation was part of the <a href="Yunmeng">Yunmeng</a> Lake <a href="Drainage%20system%20%28geomorphology%29">drainage system</a> during the Late Cretaceous. The <a href="palaeoclimate">palaeoclimate</a> of the Xixia basin is inferred to have been <a href="subtropical">subtropical</a>, sub-humid to sub-arid, based on the preponderance of <a href="C3%20plants">C3 plants</a> identified in the diet of the dinosaurs there (determined through <a href="Isotope">isotopic</a> study of egg shells). Other dinosaurs from the formation include the <a href="alvarezsaurid">alvarezsaurid</a> "<a href="Xixianykus">Xixianykus</a>", the <a href="hadrosauroid">hadrosauroid</a> "<a href="Zhanghenglong">Zhanghenglong</a>", an unnamed <a href="spinosaurid">spinosaurid</a>, <a href="ankylosaurid">ankylosaurid</a>, and <a href="sauropods">sauropods</a>. The discovery of abundant and diverse dinosaur eggs in Henan Province has been considered "one of the significant scientific events" in China. Dinosaur <a href="ootaxa">ootaxa</a> (taxa based on eggs) from the Formation include "<a href="Ovaloolithus">Ovaloolithus</a>", "<a href="Paraspheroolithus">Paraspheroolithus</a>", "<a href="Placoolithus">Placoolithus</a>", "<a href="Dendroolithus">Dendroolithus</a>", "<a href="Prismatoolithus">Prismatoolithus</a>", "<a href="Youngoolithus">Youngoolithus</a>", and "<a href="Nanhiungoolithus">Nanhiungoolithus</a>". Reptiles include <a href="turtles">turtles</a> and <a href="crocodilians">crocodilians</a>. Invertebrates include the <a href="bivalves">bivalves</a> "<a href="Plicatounio">Plicatounio</a>" and "<a href="Sphaerium">Sphaerium</a>" and the <a href="clam%20shrimp">clam shrimp</a> "<a href="Tylestheria">Tylestheria</a>" (invertebrate <a href="trace%20fossils">trace fossils</a> are also known).

Babakotia

Babakotia is an extinct <a href="genus">genus</a> of medium-sized <a href="lemur">lemur</a>, or <a href="strepsirrhine">strepsirrhine</a> <a href="primate">primate</a>, from <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> that contains a single species, Babakotia radofilai. Together with "<a href="Palaeopropithecus">Palaeopropithecus</a>", "<a href="Archaeoindris">Archaeoindris</a>", and "<a href="Mesopropithecus">Mesopropithecus</a>", it forms the family Palaeopropithecidae, commonly known as the <a href="sloth%20lemur">sloth lemur</a>s. The name "Babakotia" comes from the <a href="Malagasy%20language">Malagasy</a> name for the <a href="indri">indri</a>, "babakoto", to which it and all other sloth lemurs are closely related. Due to its mix of <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological trait</a>s that show intermediate stages between the slow-moving smaller sloth lemurs and the suspensory large sloth lemurs, it has helped determine the relationship between both groups and the closely related and extinct <a href="monkey%20lemur">monkey lemur</a>s.

"Babakotia radofilai" and all other sloth lemurs share many traits with living <a href="sloth">sloth</a>s, demonstrating <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>. It had long forearms, curved digits, and highly mobile hip and ankle joints. Its skull was more heavily built than that of <a href="indriidae">indriids</a>, but not as much as in the larger sloth lemurs. Its <a href="dentition">dentition</a> is similar to that of all other indriids and sloth lemurs. It lived in the northern part of Madagascar and shared its range with at least two other sloth lemur species, "Palaeopropithecus ingens" and "Mesopropithecus dolichobrachion". "Babakotia radofilai" was primarily a leaf-eater (<a href="folivore">folivore</a>), though it also ate fruit and hard seeds. It is known only from <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> remains and may have died out shortly after the arrival of humans on the island, but not enough <a href="radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon dating</a> has been done with this species to know for certain.

The name of the genus "Babakotia" derives from the <a href="Malagasy%20language">Malagasy</a> common name for the <a href="Indri">Indri</a>, "babakoto", a close relative of "Babakotia". The <a href="Species">species name</a>, "radofilai", was chosen in honor of French mathematician and <a href="expatriate">expatriate</a> Jean Radofilao, an avid <a href="Caving">spelunker</a> who mapped the caves where remains of "Babakotia radofilai" were first found.

"Babakotia radofilai" is the sole member of the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Babakotia" and belongs to the <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Palaeopropithecidae">Palaeopropithecidae</a>, which includes three other genera of <a href="sloth%20lemur">sloth lemur</a>s: "<a href="Palaeopropithecus">Palaeopropithecus</a>", "<a href="Archaeoindris">Archaeoindris</a>", and "<a href="Mesopropithecus">Mesopropithecus</a>". This family in turn belongs to the <a href="Taxonomic%20rank">infraorder</a> <a href="Lemuriformes">Lemuriformes</a>, which includes all the Malagasy lemurs.

The first subfossil remains of "Babakotia radofilai" were discovered as part of a series of expeditions following upon discoveries of Jean Radofilao and two Anglo-Malagasy reconnaissance expeditions in 1981 and 1986–7. The second wave of research was launched in the 1980s by <a href="Biological%20anthropology">biological anthropologist</a> <a href="Elwyn%20L.%20Simons">Elwyn L. Simons</a> who unearthed in 1988 at a cave known as <a href="Antsiroandoha">Antsiroandoha</a> in the <a href="Ankarana%20Reserve">Ankarana Massif</a>, northern Madagascar a nearly complete skeleton and skull in addition to the remains of roughly a dozen other individuals. Identified immediately as a sloth lemur (palaeopropithecid) upon its discovery, "Babakotia" along with "Mesopropithecus" helped to settle a debate about the relationship between the sloth lemurs, the <a href="monkey%20lemur">monkey lemur</a>s (family Archaeolemuridae) and the living <a href="Indriidae">indriid</a>s. The monkey lemurs had skulls that more closely resembled the indriids, but their teeth were very specialized and unlike those of the indriids. The larger sloth lemurs, on the other hand, retained a <a href="dentition">dentition</a> similar to living indriids, yet differed by having more robust and specialized skulls. "Babakotia" and "Mesopropithecus" not only shared the indriid dentition, but also the indriid-like skulls, providing evidence that sloth lemurs were most closely related to living indriids, with monkey lemurs as a <a href="Cladistics">sister group</a> to both. Furthermore, the discovery of "Babakotia" helped to demonstrate that the ancestral indriids were not "ricochetal leapers" (bouncing rapidly from tree to tree) like living indriids, but vertical climbers and hanging feeders, and possibly occasional leapers.

Weighing between , "Babakotia radofilai" was a medium-sized lemur and noticeably smaller than the large sloth lemurs ("Archaeoindris" and "Palaeopropithecus"), but larger than the small sloth lemurs ("Mesopropithecus"). In many ways, it had an intermediate level of adaptations for <a href="suspensory%20behavior">suspensory behavior</a> between the large sloth lemurs and the small sloth lemurs. This includes its highly mobile hip and ankle joints, as well as other specializations in the vertebral column, pelvis, and limbs. Its <a href="forelimb">forelimb</a>s were 20% longer than its <a href="hind%20limb">hind limb</a>s, giving it a higher <a href="intermembral%20index">intermembral index</a> (~119) than "Mesopropithecus" (~97 to 113), suggesting that it was <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergently</a> similar to <a href="Arboreal%20locomotion">arboreal</a> <a href="sloth">sloth</a>s. It had a reduced <a href="Tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> and curved, elongated digits, adapted for grasping and suggesting suspensory behavior. Its hind feet were reduced, making it well-adapted for climbing and hanging (like in other palaeopropithecids), but not leaping (like in indriids). Wrist bones found in 1999 further demonstrated that this species was a vertical climber. Additionally, analysis of its <a href="semicircular%20canal">semicircular canal</a>s, <a href="lumbar%20vertebrae">lumbar vertebrae</a> and its spinous processes indicate slow movement and climbing (antipronograde) adaptations, but not necessarily sloth-like hanging, vertical clinging, or leaping. Therefore, it was likely a slow climber like a <a href="loris">loris</a> and also exhibited some suspensory behavior like a sloth.

All sloth lemurs have relatively robust skulls compared to the indriids, yet despite shared <a href="cranium">cranial</a> features with the larger sloth lemurs, its skull still resembles that of an indri. The cranial traits shared with the other sloth lemurs include relatively small <a href="Orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbit</a>s, robust <a href="zygomatic%20arch">zygomatic arch</a>es, and a mostly rectangular <a href="hard%20palate">hard palate</a>. The small orbits taken into consideration with the relative size of the <a href="optic%20canal">optic canal</a> suggest that "Babakotia" had low <a href="visual%20acuity">visual acuity</a>, which is typical for lemurs. The skull length averages .

The <a href="Dentition">dental formula</a> of "Babakotia radofilai" was the same as the other sloth lemurs and indriids: either or . It is unclear whether one of the teeth in the <a href="Permanent%20teeth">permanent dentition</a> is an <a href="incisor">incisor</a> or <a href="canine%20tooth">canine</a>, resulting in these two conflicting dental formulae. Regardless, the lack of either a lower canine or incisor results in a four-tooth <a href="toothcomb">toothcomb</a> instead of the more typical six-tooth strepsirrhine toothcomb. "Babakotia radofilai" differed slightly from indriids in having somewhat elongated <a href="premolar">premolar</a>s. Its cheek teeth had broad shearing crests and crenulated <a href="Tooth%20enamel">enamel</a>.

Like all other lemurs, "Babakotia radofilai" was <a href="endemic">endemic</a> to Madagascar. Its remains have only been found in <a href="Cave%23Solutional%20cave">limestone cave</a>s at the Ankarana Massif within the <a href="Ankarana%20Reserve">Ankarana Reserve</a> and at <a href="Anjohibe">Anjohibe</a>, indicating a range across the extreme north and northwest of the island. The restricted range of this arboreal primate, particularly during a time when much of the island was blanketed in forest, might have been due to habitat specificity, <a href="Competitive%20exclusion%20principle">competitive exclusion</a>, or some other unknown factor. It was <a href="sympatric">sympatric</a> (occurred together) with "Palaeopropithecus maximus" and "Mesopropithecus dolichobrachion".

Based on its size, the morphology of its <a href="Molar%20tooth">molar</a>s, and microwear analysis on its teeth, "Babakotia radofilai" was likely a <a href="folivore">folivore</a>, while supplementing its diet with fruit and hard <a href="Seed%20predation">seeds</a>. In all sloth lemurs, including "Babakotia radofilai", the <a href="permanent%20tooth">permanent teeth</a> erupted early, a trait seen in indriids that improves survivability of juveniles during the first dry season following <a href="weaning">weaning</a>.

Because it died out relatively recently and is only known from subfossil remains, it is considered to be a modern form of Malagasy lemur. "Babakotia radofilai" lived during the <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> <a href="Epoch%20%28geology%29">epoch</a> and is thought to have disappeared shortly after the arrival of humans to the island, possibly within the last 1,000 years. The only <a href="Radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon date</a> that has been reported for it dates back to 3100–2800 BCE.

Mesopropithecus

Mesopropithecus is an extinct <a href="genus">genus</a> of small to medium-sized <a href="lemur">lemur</a>, or <a href="strepsirrhine">strepsirrhine</a> <a href="primate">primate</a>, from <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> that includes three species, M. dolichobrachion, M. globiceps, and M. pithecoides. Together with "<a href="Palaeopropithecus">Palaeopropithecus</a>", "<a href="Archaeoindris">Archaeoindris</a>", and "<a href="Babakotia">Babakotia</a>", it is part of the <a href="sloth%20lemur">sloth lemur</a> family (Palaeopropithecidae). Once thought to be an <a href="indriid">indriid</a> because its <a href="skull">skull</a> is similar to that of living <a href="sifaka">sifaka</a>s, a recently discovered <a href="postcranial">postcranial</a> skeleton shows "Mesopropithecus" had longer forelimbs than <a href="hindlimb">hindlimb</a>s—a distinctive trait shared by sloth lemurs but not by indriids. However, as it had the shortest <a href="forelimb">forelimb</a>s of all sloth lemurs, it is thought that "Mesopropithecus" was more <a href="Quadrupedalism">quadrupedal</a> and did not use <a href="Suspensory%20behavior">suspension</a> as much as the other sloth lemurs.

All three species ate leaves, fruits, and seeds, but the proportions were different. "M. pithecoides" was primarily a leaf-eater (<a href="folivore">folivore</a>s), but also ate fruit and occasionally seeds. "M. globiceps" ate a mix of fruits and leaves, as well as a larger quantity of seeds than "M. pithecoides". "M. dolichobrachion" also consumed a mixed diet of fruits and leaves, but analysis of its teeth suggests that it was more of a <a href="seed%20predator">seed predator</a> than the other two species.

Although rare, the three species were widely distributed across the island yet <a href="allopatric">allopatric</a> to each other, with "M. dolichobrachion" in the north, "M. pithecoides" in the south and west, and "M. globiceps" in the center of the island. "M. dolichobrachion" was the most distinct of the three species due to its longer arms. "Mesopropithecus" was one of the smallest of the known extinct <a href="subfossil%20lemur">subfossil lemur</a>s, but was still slightly larger than the largest living lemurs. Known only from <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> remains, it died out after the arrival of humans on the island, probably due to hunting pressure and <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a>.

"Mesopropithecus" is a <a href="genus">genus</a> within the <a href="sloth%20lemur">sloth lemur</a> <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> (Palaeopropithecidae), which includes three other genera: "<a href="Palaeopropithecus">Palaeopropithecus</a>", "<a href="Archaeoindris">Archaeoindris</a>", and "<a href="Babakotia">Babakotia</a>". This family in turn belongs to the infraorder Lemuriformes, which includes all the Malagasy <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s.

"Mesopropithecus" was named in 1905 by <a href="Herbert%20F.%20Standing">Herbert F. Standing</a> using four skulls found at <a href="Ampasambazimba">Ampasambazimba</a>. He noted that the animal had characteristics of both "Palaeopropithecus" and the living <a href="sifaka">sifaka</a>s ("Propithecus"). In 1936, Charles Lamberton defined "Neopropithecus globiceps" (based on one skull from <a href="Tsirave">Tsirave</a>) and "N. platyfrons" (based on two skulls from <a href="Anavoha">Anavoha</a>). He thought that "Neopropithecus" was a separate, intermediate genus between "Mesopropithecus" and "Propithecus". In 1971, <a href="paleoanthropologist">paleoanthropologist</a> <a href="Ian%20Tattersall">Ian Tattersall</a> merged "N. platyfrons" into "N. globiceps" and "Neopropithecus" into "Mesopropithecus".

Until 1986, "Mesopropithecus" was only known from <a href="Skull">cranial</a> (skull) remains from central and southern Madagascar, and because these are similar to teeth and skulls of living <a href="Indriidae">indriid</a>s, particularly those of <a href="Verreaux%27s%20sifaka">Verreaux's sifaka</a> ("Propithecus verreauxi"), "Mesopropithecus" was often assigned to the family Indriidae. For example, in 1974, Tattersall and Schwartz labeled "Mesopropithecus" as a <a href="Cladistics">sister group</a> to sifakas. With the discovery of an associated skeleton of "M. dolichobrachion" near Ankarana in 1986, it became clear that "Mesopropithecus" shared distinct traits with sloth lemurs. Unlike the indriids, but like the sloth lemurs, they had elongated forelimbs and other adaptations for arboreal <a href="Suspensory%20behavior">suspension</a> (hanging in trees), linking them most closely to family Paleaeopropithecidae. A comparison of these morphological traits between the sloth lemurs and indriids suggest that "Mesopropithecus" was the first genus to diverge within the sloth lemur family.

Three species are recognized within "Mesopropithecus":


The genus "Mesopropithecus" includes some of the smallest of the recently extinct <a href="subfossil%20lemur">subfossil lemur</a>s, but all species were still noticeably larger than all living (<a href="Extant%20taxon">extant</a>) lemurs. They ranged in weight from . They were also the least specialized of the sloth lemurs, more closely resembling living indriids in both skull and postcranial characteristics. Skull length ranged from . The <a href="dentition">dentition</a> and cranial proportions, however, more closely resembled those of the sifakas. The <a href="dental%20formula">dental formula</a> of "Mesopropithecus" was the same as in the other sloth lemur and indriids: either or . "Mesopropithecus" had a four-toothed <a href="toothcomb">toothcomb</a>, like all indriids and most other sloth lemurs. It is unclear whether one of the <a href="permanent%20teeth">permanent teeth</a> in the toothcomb is an <a href="incisor">incisor</a> or <a href="canine%20tooth">canine</a>, resulting in the two conflicting dental formulae. Like other sloth lemurs and indriids, "Mesopropithecus" had rapid <a href="tooth%20development">tooth development</a>.

Despite the similarities, there are several features that distinguish "Mesopropithecus" skulls from those of living indriids. The skull, including the zygomatic arch, is more robustly built. The <a href="temporal%20line">temporal line</a>s join together anteriorly into a sagittal crest and there is a distinct nuchal ridge that joins the rear of the zygomatic arch. The skull has a more rounded <a href="braincase">braincase</a>, slightly smaller and more convergent <a href="Orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbit</a>s, more pronounced <a href="postorbital%20constriction">postorbital constriction</a> (narrowing of the skull behind the eye sockets), more robust <a href="postorbital%20bar">postorbital bar</a> (bone that encircles the eye socket), a steeper facial angle, more robust and cranially convex zygomatic bone, and a broader, squared snout. The upper <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s and <a href="canine%20tooth">canine</a>s are larger. The more robust <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (lower jaw) and <a href="mandibular%20symphysis">mandibular symphysis</a> (point where the two halves of the lower jaw meet) suggest a more folivorous diet, which requires extra grinding. The orbits are as large (in absolute size) as those in smaller living indriids, which suggests low <a href="visual%20acuity">visual acuity</a>. "Mesopropithecus" and its closest sloth lemur relative, "Babakotia", did share a few ancestral traits with indriids, unlike the largest sloth lemurs, "Palaeopropithecus" and "Archaeoindris". These include the aforementioned four-toothed toothcomb, an inflated <a href="auditory%20bulla">auditory bulla</a> (bony structure that encloses part of the middle and inner ear), and an intrabullar <a href="ectotympanic%20ring">ectotympanic ring</a> (bony ring that holds the eardrum).

While the skull of "Mesopropithecus" most closely resembles that of modern sifakas, the postcranial skeleton is quite different. Rather than having elongated hindlimbs for <a href="leaping">leaping</a>, "Mesopropithecus" had elongated <a href="forelimb">forelimb</a>s, suggesting they predominantly used <a href="quadrupedal">quadrupedal</a> locomotion, slow climbing, with some forelimb and <a href="hindlimb">hindlimb</a> suspension. In fact, they were the most quadrupedal of the sloth lemurs, having an intermembral index between 97 and 113, compared to the lower value for indriids and higher values for the other sloth lemurs. (In arboreal primates, an intermembral index of 100 predicts quadrupedalism, higher values predict suspensory behavior, and lower values predict leaping behavior.) Wrist bones found in 1999 further demonstrate that "Mesopropithecus" was a vertical climber and the most <a href="loris">loris</a>-like of the sloth lemurs. Analysis of a lumbar vertebra of "M. dolichobrachion" further supported this conclusion.

Our understanding of the morphology of "Mesopropithecus" has not always been so complete. Until recently, important pieces of the skeleton had not been discovered, including the <a href="Radius%20%28bone%29">radius</a>, <a href="ulna">ulna</a>, <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>e, hand and foot bones, and the <a href="pelvis">pelvis</a>. In 1936, Alice Carleton mistakenly associated postcranial remains of the <a href="diademed%20sifaka">diademed sifaka</a> ("Propithecus diadema") from Ampasambazimba with "Mesopropithecus pithecoides" and came to the false conclusion that its morphology was like that of a monkey. This mistaken attribution was corrected in 1948 by Charles Lamberton.
"Mesopropithecus" species appear to have been generally rare within their wide range. Collectively, the three species have been found in the north, south, west, and center of Madagascar, although they appear to have been geographically separated (allopatric) from each other. <a href="Subfossil">Subfossil</a> discoveries indicate that they lived in the same region (<a href="sympatric">sympatric</a>) with other sloth lemurs in the north and center of Madagascar. The subfossil remains of "M. globiceps" have been found at seven <a href="subfossil%20sites%20on%20Madagascar">subfossil sites on Madagascar</a>: <a href="Anavoha">Anavoha</a>, <a href="Ankazoabo%20Cave">Ankazoabo Cave</a>, <a href="Belo%20sur%20Mer">Belo sur Mer</a>, <a href="Manombo-Toliara">Manombo-Toliara</a>, <a href="Taolambiby">Taolambiby</a>, <a href="Tsiandroina">Tsiandroina</a>, <a href="Tsirave">Tsirave</a>. The subfossil remains of both "M. pithecoides" and "M. dolichobrachion" have only been found at one site each, <a href="Ampasambazimba">Ampasambazimba</a> and <a href="Ankarana">Ankarana</a> respectively.

"M. pithecoides" from the central plateau was a specialized leaf-eater (folivore), but the other two species had a more mixed diet, eating fruits and seeds in addition to leaves. The level of seed predation varies between the three species, with tooth wear indicating that "M. dolichobrachion" exhibited the greatest level of seed predation within the genus.

Because "Mesopropithecus" died out relatively recently and is only known from subfossil remains, it is considered to be a modern form of Malagasy lemur. It may have been among the last subfossil lemurs to go extinct, possibly surviving until 500 years ago, although radiocarbon dating places the most recent remains at 570–679 CE for a "M. pithecoides" from Ampasambazimba. The arrival of humans roughly 2,000 years ago is thought to have sparked the decline of "Mesopropithecus" through hunting, <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a>, or both.

Menominee Tribe v. United States

Menominee Tribe v. United States, 391 U.S. 404 (1968), is a case in which the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> ruled that the <a href="Menominee">Menominee Indian Tribe</a> kept their historical hunting and fishing rights even after the federal government ceased to recognize the tribe. It was a <a href="List%20of%20landmark%20court%20decisions%20in%20the%20United%20States">landmark decision</a> in <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> case law.

The Menominee Indian Tribe had entered into a series of treaties with the United States that did not specifically state that they had hunting and fishing rights. In 1961, Congress terminated the tribe's <a href="Native%20American%20recognition%20in%20the%20United%20States">federal recognition</a>, ending its right to govern itself, federal support of health care and education programs, police and fire protection, and tribal rights to land. In 1963, three members of the tribe were charged with violating <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>'s hunting and fishing laws on land which had been a <a href="Indian%20reservation">reservation</a> for over 100 years. The tribe members were acquitted, but when the state appealed, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the Menominee tribe no longer had hunting and fishing rights because of the termination action by Congress.

The tribe sued the United States for compensation in the <a href="US%20Court%20of%20Claims">US Court of Claims</a>, which ruled that tribal members still had hunting and fishing rights and that Congress had not abrogated the rights. The opposite rulings by the state and federal courts brought the issue to the Supreme Court. In 1968, the Supreme Court held that the tribe retained its hunting and fishing rights under the treaties involved and the rights were not lost after federal recognition was ended by the <a href="Indian%20termination%20policy%23Menominee%20Termination%20Act">Menominee Indian Termination Act</a> without a clear and unequivocal statement by <a href="US%20Congress">Congress</a> removing the rights.

Ancestors of the Menominee Indian Tribe may have lived in the states of <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> for the last 10,000 years. Their traditional territory was about 10 million acres (4 million hectares). They first acknowledged that they were under the protection of the United States in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20St.%20Louis%20%281817%29">Treaty of St. Louis (1817)</a>. In 1825 and 1827, the treaties of <a href="First%20Treaty%20of%20Prairie%20du%20Chien">Prairie du Chien</a> and <a href="Treaty%20of%20Butte%20des%20Morts">Butte des Morts</a> answered boundary questions. None of the early treaties addressed hunting and fishing rights. In 1831, the tribe entered into the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Washington%2C%20with%20Menominee%20%281831%29">Treaty of Washington</a>, which ceded about to the federal government. These two treaties reserved hunting and fishing rights for the tribe on the ceded land until the President of the United States ordered the land surveyed and sold to settlers. In 1836, the tribe entered into the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Cedar%20Point">Treaty of Cedar Point</a>, under which were ceded to the federal government. The treaty did not mention hunting or fishing rights.
In 1848, the tribe entered into another treaty with the United States, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Lake%20Poygan">Treaty of Lake Poygan</a>, which ceded the tribe's remaining approximately in exchange for west of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> in present-day <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>. This treaty was contingent on the tribe examining the land proposed for them and accepting it as suitable. In 1850, <a href="Chief%20Oshkosh">Chief Oshkosh</a> led a delegation to the <a href="Long%20Prairie%20River">Crow Wing area</a> and determined that the land was not suitable for the tribe, mainly because the proposed reservation was located between two warring tribes, the <a href="Sioux%23Eastern%20Dakota">Dakota</a> and <a href="Ojibwe">Ojibwe</a>. Oshkosh then pressed for a new treaty, stating that he "preferred a home somewhere in Wisconsin, for the poorest region in Wisconsin was better than the Crow Wing."

The tribe had been living in an area near the <a href="Wolf%20River%20%28Fox%20River%29">Wolf River</a>. They entered into the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Wolf%20River">Treaty of Wolf River</a> with the United States in 1854. The United States set aside of land for a reservation in present-day <a href="Menominee%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Menominee County</a>, Wisconsin. In return, the tribe ceded the land in Minnesota back to the federal government. None of the previous treaties except the Treaty of Washington addressed the tribe's retained hunting and fishing rights, but stated that the reservation was "to be held as Indian lands are held".

Since the Treaty of Wolf River, this area has been the tribe's home, and they were free from state taxation, regulation and court jurisdiction. Of the original land, of prime timberland remained under the tribe's control, while the remaining land was transferred to the <a href="Mahican">Mahican</a> and <a href="Lenape">Lenape</a> (the latter also known as the Delaware or Munsee) tribes. During this period, the Menominee enjoyed complete freedom to regulate hunting and fishing on the reservation, with the acquiescence of Wisconsin.

In the mid- to late-1940s, the Menominee tribe was considered by a government survey to identify <a href="Tribe%20%28Native%20American%29">tribes</a> for <a href="Indian%20termination%20policy">termination</a>, a process in which federal recognition of the tribe would be withdrawn and the tribe would no longer be dependent on the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Indian%20Affairs">Bureau of Indian Affairs</a> (BIA) to support them. The Menominee were thought to be a tribe that could be terminated because they were one of the richest tribes in the nation. The federal government thought that termination would allow the tribal members to be <a href="Americanization%20%28of%20Native%20Americans%29">assimilated</a> into mainstream American culture, becoming hard-working, tax-paying, productive citizens. In 1954, Congress terminated the federally recognized status of the tribe with the <a href="Indian%20termination%20policy%23Menominee%20Termination%20Act">Menominee Indian Termination Act</a>. According to the terms of the Termination Act, the federally recognized status was to end in 1958. The tribe and the state of Wisconsin successfully lobbied for a delay in the implementation of termination until 1961. The tribe was opposed to termination for a number of reasons; their concerns included the loss of tribal culture, the loss of land due to <a href="tax%20liens">tax liens</a>, the possibility of bankruptcy and loss of the tribal timber industry, and the lack of tribal members who were trained to run a county government. The state of Wisconsin was concerned that with no industry for the tribe to tax, the state would be responsible for the large financial outlay that would be required to maintain governmental operations for the former reservation.

On termination, the Menominee, which was one of the wealthiest tribes prior to termination, became one of the poorest. In 1954, the tribe's timber operations allowed it to be self-sufficient. The tribe, which owned utility companies, paid for a hospital, BIA salaries, local schools, and a stipend to tribal members. The tribe was forced to use its reserve funds to develop a termination plan that they did not want and instead of having a reserve, they entered into termination with a $300,000 deficit. Menominee County was created out of the old reservation boundaries and the tribe immediately had to finance its own police and fire protection. Without federal support and with no tax base, the situation became dire. The tribe closed the hospital, sold its utility company, and contracted those services to neighboring counties. The Menominee Enterprises, Inc., formed to care for the tribe's needs after termination, was unable to pay property taxes and began to consider selling off tribal property. Many Menominee tribal members believed that the sponsor of the termination bill, <a href="United%20States%20Senator">Senator</a> <a href="Arthur%20Vivian%20Watkins">Arthur Wilkins</a> of <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, intended to force the loss of rich tribal lands to non-Indians. In 1962, the state of Wisconsin took the position that the hunting and fishing rights were abrogated by the termination act and that the tribal members were subject to state hunting and fishing regulations. With the poverty in the former reservation, the loss of hunting rights meant the loss of one of their last remaining means of survival.

In 1962, tribal members Joseph L. Sanapaw, William J. Grignon, and Francis Basina were charged with violating state hunting and fishing regulations. All three admitted to the acts in open court, but claimed that the Wolf River Treaty gave them the right to hunt. The state trial court agreed and acquitted the three. The state was given leave to pursue a <a href="writ%20of%20error">writ of error</a> and appealed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court to answer whether the Termination Act canceled those rights retained by treaty.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court in "State v. Sanapaw" held that the <a href="treaty%20rights">treaty rights</a> were terminated by Congress. In analyzing the case, the Wisconsin Supreme Court first had to determine whether the tribe had hunting and fishing rights under treaties with the United States. It found that although the Wolf River Treaty did not specifically mention hunting and fishing rights, the term "to be held as Indian lands are held" was clear. Indians have always been able to hunt and fish on their own land, and if a term in a treaty with Indians is ambiguous, the Wisconsin Supreme Court found that it must be resolved in favor of the tribe. Since the tribe originally had hunting and fishing rights under the treaty, the Wisconsin Supreme Court then looked to determine whether Congress had removed those rights by enacting the Menominee Termination Act. The Wisconsin Supreme Court held that Congress had used its <a href="plenary%20power">plenary power</a> to abrogate those rights.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court placed special emphasis on the phrase "all statutes of the United States which affect Indians because of their status as Indians shall no longer be applicable to the members of the tribe, and "the laws of the several States shall apply to the tribe and its members in the same manner as they apply to other citizens or persons within their jurisdiction"." The Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the latter section was controlling, despite the tribal members' argument that hunting rights were retained by treaty rather than by statute. The Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the tribe had lost their hunting and fishing rights. The tribal members appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear the appeal.

The Menominee sued in the <a href="U.S.%20Court%20of%20Claims">U.S. Court of Claims</a> to recover compensation for the loss of their hunting and fishing rights. The Court of Claims first clarified that the Menominee Termination Act did not abolish the tribe or its membership, but merely ended federal supervision of the tribe. Since the Menominee was still a tribe, although not one under federal trusteeship, the tribe had a right to assert a claim arising out of the Wolf River Treaty in accordance with the <a href="Indian%20Claims%20Commission%20Act">Indian Claims Commission Act</a> and the <a href="Tucker%20Act">Tucker Act</a>.

The Court of Claims looked at whether the tribe had hunting and fishing rights and drew the same conclusion as the Wisconsin Supreme Court—that the terms of the treaty had to be resolved in the favor of the tribe, citing "The Menominee Tribe of Indians v. United States", 95 Ct.Cl. 232 (Ct.Cl., 1941). In that decision, the Court of Claims had observed that the reason the tribe had agreed to the site of the reservation was that it was well suited for hunting, with plenty of game. The hunting rights by treaty were therefore confirmed.

The Court of Claims had to determine whether the Menominee Termination Act had taken away that right. If it had, the tribe would have a valid claim for compensation; but if not, then there would be no compensation. On April 14, 1967, the Court of Claims denied the claim, stating that the hunting and fishing rights had not been abrogated by the Termination Act. In arriving at this decision, it said that the legislative history included two witnesses who stated that the Act would not affect hunting and fishing rights acquired by treaty, but would abrogate any such rights acquired by statute. Additionally, the Court of Claims observed that Congress also amended <a href="Public%20Law%20280">Public Law 280</a> so that Indian hunting and fishing rights were protected in Wisconsin. The decision contradicted the decision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

On October 9, 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal and granted "<a href="certiorari">certiorari</a>" (a writ to the lower court to send the case to them for review) to resolve the conflict between the Wisconsin Supreme Court and the federal Court of Claims.

In most appeals, the parties argue opposing positions. In this case, both the appellee (the Menominee) and the appellant (the United States) argued that the decision of the Court of Claims should be affirmed. The State of Wisconsin, as "<a href="amicus%20curiae">amicus curiae</a>", argued that the Court of Claims ruling should be reversed.

The tribe was represented by Charles A. Hobbs of Washington, D.C. The tribe argued that the Menominee Termination Act did not extinguish treaty rights, but instead had two purposes; to terminate federal supervision of the tribe and to transfer to the state general criminal and civil jurisdictionwhich had already been accomplished by Public Law 280 and that law expressly preserved hunting and fishing rights. In the event that the court would decide that the hunting and fishing rights were extinguished, then the tribe should receive compensation for the loss of the rights.

The United States was represented by Louis F. Claiborne, assistant to the <a href="United%20States%20Solicitor%20General">U.S. Solicitor General</a>. The United States also argued that the Menominee Termination Act did not extinguish hunting and fishing rights under the 1854 treaty and therefore the tribe was not due compensation from the United States. Claiborne also argued that whatever regulatory rights which were held by the federal government were transferred to the state of Wisconsin by the termination act.

The case was originally argued on January 22, 1968. During oral argument, some of the justices were concerned that the state of Wisconsin was not a party to the case. Following oral arguments, the court called for reargument and requested that Wisconsin present an oral argument in addition to the brief it had filed with the court. Justice Marshall recused himself from the case, as he had been the U.S. Solicitor General the previous year and had participated in the government's preparation of the case.

On April 25, 1968, the case was reargued. The tribe was again represented by Hobbs, who made the same basic argument that the hunting and fishing rights were not extinguished. The state of Wisconsin was represented by <a href="Bronson%20La%20Follette">Bronson La Follette</a>, the <a href="State%20attorney%20general">Attorney General</a> of Wisconsin. La Follette argued that the plain language of the termination act not only ended federal supervision of the tribe, but extinguished the tribe and with it all treaty rights. He argued that the Court of Claims ruling was incorrect and should be reversed, and that the tribe was due compensation from the federal government. The United States was again represented by Claiborne, who reiterated his earlier argument.

Justice <a href="William%20O.%20Douglas">William O. Douglas</a> delivered the opinion of the court. In a 6-2 decision, the ruling of the U.S. Court of Claims was affirmed, ruling that the tribe retained its hunting and fishing rights under the treaty. Douglas noted that Public Law 280 had been enacted and was fully in force for approximately seven years before the Termination Act became effective. The section of that law that dealt with Wisconsin provided that hunting and fishing rights in "Indian Country" were protected from state regulation and action. Thus from 1954 until termination in 1961, the Menominee's hunting and fishing rights were not interfered with by Wisconsin. The Termination Act stated that all federal statutes dealing with the tribe were no longer in force, but Douglas noted that it was silent with regard to treaties. The act did not specifically address the hunting and fishing rights, and Douglas stated that the U.S. Supreme Court would "decline to construe the Termination Act as a backhanded way of abrogating the hunting and fishing rights of these Indians." He noted that in a similar bill for the <a href="Klamath%20Tribe">Klamath Tribe</a>, there was a discussion on paying the tribe to buy out their hunting and fishing rights, a clear indication that Congress was aware of the implications. Douglas found it hard to believe that Congress would subject the United States to a claim for compensation without an explicit statement to that effect. He found that without a specific abrogation of those rights, the tribe retained those rights.

Justice <a href="Potter%20Stewart">Potter Stewart</a>, joined by Justice <a href="Hugo%20Black">Hugo Black</a>, dissented. Stewart acknowledged that the Wolf River Treaty unquestionably conferred hunting and fishing rights on the tribe and its members. He stated that the Termination Act subjected the members of the tribe to the same laws that all other citizens of Wisconsin were held to, including hunting and fishing regulations. In Stewart's opinion, Public Law 280 had no bearing on the case and the rights were not protected by the Termination Act, so they were lost. Stewart did note that this would have also made the claim for compensation valid under "<a href="Shoshone%20Tribe%20v.%20United%20States">Shoshone Tribe v. United States</a>", regardless of whether Congress intended it or not. He would have reversed the decision of the Court of Claims.

"Menominee Tribe v. United States" is a <a href="landmark%20case">landmark case</a> in Native American law, primarily in the area of reserved tribal rights. It has been used in college courses to explain <a href="Tribal%20sovereignty%20in%20the%20United%20States">tribal sovereignty</a> rights and that tribes retain some rights even if the tribe has been terminated, as the Menominee tribe was. The decision in the case has affected subsequent legislation, such as the <a href="Alaska%20Native%20Claims%20Settlement%20Act">Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act</a>, in which Congress expressly extinguished all aboriginal rights. The case has been discussed internationally, for example in Australia regarding the relevance of indigenous or <a href="aboriginal%20title">aboriginal title</a>.

The case has been cited in over 300 <a href="law%20review">law review</a> articles . A consistent point made in numerous articles is that while Congress may terminate tribal and treaty rights, it must show a "specific intent to abrogate them." It is repeatedly cited by cases and law reviews to show that the court will construe laws and treaties, where ambiguous, in favor of the tribes. Judges and legal experts have noted that hunting and fishing rights are valuable property rights, and if the government takes away such rights, it must compensate those who hold the rights for their loss.

Courts must also construe treaty rights and statutes liberally in favor of the Indians, even when the treaty does not specifically speak of hunting and fishing.

In 1973, Congress repealed termination and restored federal recognition of the Menominee tribe. The <a href="Menominee%20Restoration%20Act">Menominee Restoration Act</a> was signed by <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>; it repealed the Menominee Indian Termination Act, reopened the tribal rolls, re-established the trust status and provided for the reformation of tribal government. The tribe was the first terminated tribe to be restored to trust and recognition status. The Restoration Act signaled the end of the termination era.

David Evans (RAAF officer)

<a href="Air%20Marshal%20%28Australia%29">Air Marshal</a> David Evans, <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia">AC</a>, <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">DSO</a>, <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">AFC</a> (born Selwyn David Evans on 3 June 1925) is a retired senior commander of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF), and a writer and consultant on defence matters. He served as <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> from 1982 until 1985. Since leaving the RAAF he has published two military treatises, "A Fatal Rivalry: Australia's Defence at Risk" and "War: A Matter of Principles", as well as an autobiography.

Enlisting in the Air Force in 1943, Evans graduated from flying school as a <a href="Sergeant%20Pilot">sergeant pilot</a>, and was converting to <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Beaufort</a> bombers when World War II ended. He gained his commission as a <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> in 1947. From 1948 to 1949, he was a member of the Australian contingent operating <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">C-47 Dakota</a> transports in the <a href="Berlin%20Blockade">Berlin Airlift</a>. He was a flying instructor in the early 1950s, before becoming a VIP captain with the <a href="Governor-General%27s%20Flight%20RAAF">Governor-General's Flight</a> in 1954. His service in the flight earned him the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Air Force Cross</a> in 1957. In the 1960s Evans was twice posted to <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadron</a>, flying <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">Canberra</a> jet bombers: first as a <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight commander</a> when the unit was based in <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> from 1960 to 1962 and then as its commanding officer during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> from 1967 to 1968. The Canberras achieved a high degree of accuracy on their bombing missions under his leadership, and he was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> after completing his tour in Vietnam.

Evans held senior staff positions in the early 1970s, before serving as Officer Commanding <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Base Amberley</a> from 1975 until 1977. Promoted to <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a>, he then became Chief of Air Force Operations. In this role he worked to improve the RAAF's strategy for the defence of Australia, to fully exploit the "air-sea gap" on the northern approaches to the continent. Appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia">Officer of the Order of Australia</a> in 1981, he was Chief of Joint Operations and Plans for the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian Defence Force</a> before his promotion to <a href="air%20marshal">air marshal</a> and elevation to Chief of the Air Staff in April 1982. As head of the Air Force he focussed on morale, air power doctrine, and improving defensive capabilities in northern Australia. He was raised to <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia">Companion of the Order of Australia</a> in 1984. Retiring from the RAAF in May 1985, Evans began to write and lecture on defence matters, and also stood for election in Federal politics. He was a board member of and defence advisor to <a href="BAE%20Systems%20Australia">British Aerospace Australia</a> (later BAE Systems Australia) from 1990 to 2009, and chairman of the <a href="National%20Capital%20Authority">National Capital Authority</a> from 1997 until 2003. In 2001 he was awarded the <a href="Centenary%20Medal">Centenary Medal</a> for his services to the ADF and the Canberra community.

Selwyn Evans, known by his middle name of David, was born in the <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> suburb of <a href="Paddington%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Paddington</a> on 3 June 1925. The son of policeman Selwyn Douglas Evans and his wife Eileen, David was educated at <a href="Marist%20College%20North%20Shore">Marist Brothers College</a> in <a href="Mosman%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Mosman</a>. A schoolboy when <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">war was declared</a>, he avidly followed reports of <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> <a href="flying%20ace">fighter aces</a> during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a>, and resolved that, once he was old enough, he would serve as a pilot. He subsequently became one of the earliest recruits to the <a href="Australian%20Air%20Force%20Cadets">Air Training Corps</a>, established in 1941 to facilitate basic training for youths aged 16 to 18 whose ambition was to become aircrew in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a>. After spending a short time as a bank clerk, Evans duly enlisted in the RAAF on 5 June 1943. He received instruction under the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a>, firstly at No. 2 Initial Training School in <a href="RAAF%20Bradfield%20Park">Bradfield Park</a>, Sydney, then at <a href="No.%205%20Elementary%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 5 Elementary Flying Training School</a> in <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Narromine">Narromine</a>, New South Wales, and finally at <a href="No.%208%20Service%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 8 Service Flying Training School</a> in <a href="Bundaberg">Bundaberg</a>, Queensland. After graduating as a <a href="Sergeant%20Pilot">sergeant pilot</a>, he was posted in October 1944 to the flying staff of No. 1 Air Observer School at <a href="Evans%20Head%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Evans Head</a>, New South Wales. Promoted to <a href="flight%20sergeant">flight sergeant</a>, Evans was in the middle of a <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a> light bomber conversion course at <a href="No.%201%20Operational%20Training%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 1 Operational Training Unit</a> in <a href="RAAF%20Base%20East%20Sale">East Sale</a>, Victoria, when the war ended on 14 August 1945. His Air Force career should have finished then and there, as he was slated for <a href="Demobilization">demobilisation</a> along with thousands of other wartime enlistees. Evans was determined to remain and travelled to RAAF Headquarters in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> to take his case to the officer responsible for discharges. He found a sympathetic ear and within days was transferred to <a href="No.%2038%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 38 Squadron</a>, with which he flew <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">C-47 Dakota</a> transports on a regular courier service to Japan between October 1945 and May 1948.
Evans was commissioned as a <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> on 3 March 1947, becoming the most junior name in the 1947 "Air Force List" of serving officers according to seniority. On 23 August 1948 he married Dorothy (Gail) Campbell, the daughter of a <a href="Merchant%20Navy">Merchant Navy</a> captain; the couple had three daughters and a son. They had planned to wed on 29 August but had to bring the ceremony forward when Evans was selected to take part in Australia's contribution to the <a href="Berlin%20Blockade">Berlin Airlift</a>. Having been promoted to <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a>, he departed Sydney on 28 August, bound for <a href="London">London</a>. From there he joined <a href="RAAF%20Squadron%20Berlin%20Air%20Lift">RAAF Squadron Berlin Air Lift</a>—which comprised crews from <a href="No.%2036%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 36</a> and 38 Squadrons and was based in <a href="L%C3%BCbeck">Lübeck</a>, West Germany—and over the next 14 months flew over 250 <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s in <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> Dakotas. Airlift operations were considered particularly challenging, as aircraft were expected to fly on instruments their entire route, often in inclement weather, and keep just three minutes separation. On one occasion, Evans and his crew discovered that boxes of <a href="condom">condom</a>s were their main cargo. According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens, "as they took off into a bleak, snow-filled night they found themselves questioning the worth of the sortie, an attitude which doubtless was not shared by the eventual recipients". Evans' worst moment was when one of his engines failed just after take-off, with 23 passengers—mostly children—aboard, but he was able to land safely.

Returning to Australia in November 1949, Evans was posted to <a href="Central%20Flying%20School%20RAAF">Central Flying School</a> (CFS) at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20East%20Sale">RAAF Base East Sale</a>, Victoria, where he qualified as a flying instructor. He served in this capacity for the next four years, including an exchange posting with the <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Air%20Force">Royal New Zealand Air Force</a> from May 1951 to July 1953. As he was preparing to depart New Zealand, he received word that his next posting would be to the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> as a pilot with <a href="No.%2077%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 77 Squadron</a>; the <a href="Korean%20Armistice%20Agreement">armistice</a> prevented this and he returned to No. 38 Squadron as an instructor. In 1954 he was assigned to transporting VIPs, serving with the <a href="Governor-General%27s%20Flight%20RAAF">Governor-General's Flight</a> (later <a href="No.%2034%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 34 (Special Transport) Squadron</a>) until 1956. As well as Governor-General <a href="William%20Slim%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Slim">Sir William Slim</a> and Lady Slim, his passengers included Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> and <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a>. Promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a>, Evans' service with the VIP flight earned him the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Air Force Cross</a> in the <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">Queen's Birthday Honours</a> promulgated in the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 13 June 1957. The same year, he attended <a href="Australian%20Defence%20College">RAAF Staff College</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Williams">Point Cook</a>, Victoria. He became personal staff officer to the <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Air</a> in 1958, a position he found valuable for the insight he gained into Australia's political culture. In November 1959, he took a refresher course at CFS, qualifying on <a href="De%20Havilland%20Vampire">De Havilland Vampire</a> and <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a> jets. He underwent further training on Canberra bombers with <a href="No.%201%20Operational%20Conversion%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 1 Operational Conversion Unit</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Base Amberley</a>, Queensland, graduating in May 1960. From then until 1962 he served as a <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight commander</a> in <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadron</a>, operating Canberras out of <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Butterworth">RAAF Base Butterworth</a>, Malaysia. He subsequently attended the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">RAF College of Air Warfare</a>. In January 1963, Evans was transferred to Air Staff Division, Canberra, where he helped formulate operational requirements for a new RAAF bomber. His final specification included a payload of , speed of <a href="Mach%20number">Mach 2</a>, and range of . This requirement was met by the <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111C">General Dynamics F-111C</a>, 24 of which were ordered by the Australian government in October 1963. As an interim measure until delivery of the F-111, the US government offered 24 <a href="Boeing%20B-47%20Stratojet">Boeing B-47 Stratojet</a>s to the RAAF. Though the offer was never seriously considered, a B-47 was test flown from Amberley to <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a> in November 1963 by the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Marshal <a href="Valston%20Hancock">Val Hancock</a>, with Evans as passenger. Evans had been assigned to fly the plane but was replaced at the last moment by Hancock; the take-off almost ended in disaster after Hancock unknowingly switched off the engines' water injection—needed to ensure sufficient thrust in hot conditions—that Evans had switched on before vacating the pilot's seat. In January 1965, Evans was posted to <a href="Washington%2C%20DC">Washington, DC</a>, as Assistant <a href="Attach%C3%A9">Air Attaché</a>, having "had quite enough of writing Air Staff Requirements".

In April 1967, the Australian government committed No. 2 Squadron and its Canberra bombers to action in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. Operating from <a href="Phan%20Rang%20Air%20Base">Phan Rang Air Base</a> outside <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a>, under the direction of the US <a href="35th%20Fighter%20Wing">35th Tactical Fighter Wing</a> (TFW), the Canberras were initially engaged in medium-altitude missions against <a href="Viet%20Cong">Viet Cong</a> forces, guided by Sky Spot ground radar, usually at night. Promoted to <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a>, Evans assumed control of the squadron in December 1967. Having never heard a shot fired in anger in his 24 years of service, he was anxious for a combat assignment. The Japanese surrender in August 1945 had prevented him from seeing action in World War II, and the Korean War had ended just as he was on the verge of a posting for active duty with No. 77 Squadron. "Vietnam", he reasoned, "would be my last chance". By the time he took command, the Canberras were flying a greater proportion of their missions at lower levels in daylight, using visual bomb-aiming methods honed during their earlier service in Malaysia; this gave the bombers an average <a href="circular%20error%20probability">circular error probability</a> (CEP) of 50 metres. Evans introduced intensive post-mission analysis to refine their technique, and permitted his pilots to bomb at the lowest level possible at which the bombsight would operate. The CEP was eventually reduced to 20 metres, making the Canberras the most accurate bombing force in the region. In January 1968, the unit participated in the air campaigns to defend <a href="Hu%E1%BA%BF">Huế</a> and <a href="Khe%20Sanh">Khe Sanh</a> during the <a href="Tet%20Offensive">Tet Offensive</a>. Phan Rang itself was often subjected to harassing attacks and mortar fire from the Viet Cong, requiring Evans to undertake improvements to the airfield's ground defences. He completed his posting to Vietnam in November 1968 and was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> for his performance as commanding officer of No. 2 Squadron. The decoration was gazetted on 2 May 1969 and backdated to 13 March.
Evans was promoted to <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> in January 1969 and appointed Director of Air Force Plans. In this position he proposed and organised the gift of 23 of the RAAF's old <a href="CAC%20Sabre">CAC Sabre</a>s to the <a href="Indonesian%20Air%20Force">Indonesian Air Force</a>, following an earlier presentation of 10 Sabres to the <a href="Royal%20Malaysian%20Air%20Force">Royal Malaysian Air Force</a>. He completed studies at the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Royal College of Defence Studies</a>, London, in 1972. Returning to Australia, he was promoted to <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a> and appointed Director-General Plans and Policy, Air Force, in January 1973. He served as Officer Commanding RAAF Base Amberley from February 1975 until April 1977. In this role he qualified as a pilot on the recently delivered F-111C swing-wing bomber, as well as the <a href="Bell%20UH-1%20Iroquois">UH-1 Iroquois</a> helicopter. Following his tour as Amberley base commander, Evans was promoted to <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a> and became Chief of Air Force Operations (CAFOPS). He held this newly created position for the next two years, broken by a temporary posting as <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a> between January and August 1978. As CAFOPS, Evans played a major part in developing the RAAF's plans for the defence of Australia. Following America's announcement in the 1969 <a href="Guam%20Doctrine">Guam Doctrine</a> that its allies would have to assume greater self-reliance in their military affairs, Australia's strategic thought underwent a change from its earlier policy of "forward defence" to a more localised defensive posture. While the consensus among RAAF planning staff was to adopt a "repulsion" concept of attacking an enemy force along the air and sea approaches to northern Australia, Evans considered that this did not go far enough in exploiting the long-range offensive capabilities of such aircraft as the F-111. Convinced that Australia's numerically small forces would be hard-pressed to dislodge an invader that had gained a foothold on the continent, he refined the "repulsion" stance into what he termed an "anti-lodgement" strategy, focussing on defeating the enemy at its potential staging bases north of Australia and then, as a last resort, on the approaches closer to home. The Air Force's role in shaping an overall strategy that took advantage of the "air-sea gap" was later acknowledged in the Federal government paper "The Defence of Australia 1987". Evans was appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia">Officer of the Order of Australia</a> on <a href="Australia%20Day">26 January 1981</a> for his achievements as CAFOPS.

In 1980, Evans was appointed Chief of Joint Operations and Plans for the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian Defence Force</a> (ADF). He was promoted to <a href="air%20marshal">air marshal</a> and became Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) on 21 April 1982, succeeding Air Marshal <a href="Neville%20McNamara">Sir Neville McNamara</a>. As CAS, Evans took steps to enhance discipline, bearing and morale in the Air Force, demanding high personal standards. He sponsored the development of an Australian air power doctrine, eventually published as the "Air Power Manual" under one of his successors, Air Marshal <a href="Ray%20Funnell">Ray Funnell</a>, in 1990. Evans also commissioned a marching tune especially for the RAAF, later to be called "Eagles of Australia", to replace the Royal Air Force march that had been in use previously. As early as 1969, he had advocated permanently basing a squadron of fighter aircraft at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Tindal">RAAF Tindal</a> in the Northern Territory. Tindal was one of a series of forward air bases initiated by Air Marshal <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Sir Frederick Scherger</a> when he was CAS in 1959, but a defence committee decision prior to Evans becoming CAS had determined to locate the RAAF's northernmost fighter squadron at Darwin. His chance remark in mid-1982 to the new Minister of Defence, <a href="Ian%20Sinclair">Ian Sinclair</a>, regarding the suitability of Tindal over Darwin led to the former base being chosen as the home of <a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 75 (Fighter) Squadron</a>. Alan Stephens described the permanent manning of Tindal as having "formalised the shift to the strategy of defence-in-depth—of defending Australia by controlling its air-sea gap". Late in 1983, Evans selected the site for the last of the Air Force's northerly "<a href="RAAF%20bare%20bases">bare bases</a>", <a href="RAAF%20Scherger">RAAF Scherger</a>, near <a href="Weipa">Weipa</a> on <a href="Cape%20York%20Peninsula">Cape York Peninsula</a>. For his service as CAS, he was raised to a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia">Companion of the Order of Australia</a> on 11 June 1984. On 2 May 1985, he became the first serving member of the ADF to be invited to speak at the <a href="National%20Press%20Club%20%28Australia%29">National Press Club</a> in Canberra. During his speech he reiterated the need for Australia to acquire an <a href="Airborne%20early%20warning%20and%20control">airborne early warning</a> capability to enhance the effectiveness of the soon-to-be-delivered <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">F/A-18 Hornet</a> multirole fighter, declaring that "<a href="Jindalee%20over-the-horizon%20radar">Jindalee</a> is not sufficient". Later that month two Hornets, whose acquisition Evans had supported while CAFOPS, were handed over to <a href="No.%202%20Operational%20Conversion%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Williamtown">RAAF Base Williamtown</a>, New South Wales, following a record non-stop flight from <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Lemoore">Naval Air Station Lemoore</a> in California. Evans had pushed for the long-distance flight, employing a <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20KC-10%20Extender">McDonnell Douglas KC-10</a> tanker to refuel the Hornets in flight, to demonstrate the RAAF's capability and the benefit of tanker aircraft. Six <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%20III">Mirage</a> fighters from No. 77 Squadron intercepted the Hornets and the KC-10 and escorted them to their landing at Williamtown, an action the CAS considered "icing on the cake—a touch of class".

Evans retired as CAS on 30 May 1985, having flown in excess of 8,600 hours during his RAAF career. He was praised by his successor, Air Marshal <a href="Jake%20Newham">Jake Newham</a>, for his "extraordinary zeal and robustness" that helped instil "a renewed sense of pride in the Service". In retirement Evans became a consultant on defence and aviation matters, and wrote and lectured extensively on air power. As a <a href="visiting%20fellow">visiting fellow</a> at the <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a>'s Strategic and Defence Studies Centre in 1986, he produced a working paper focussing on the RAAF's concept of operations, "Air Operations in Northern Australia". The same year, he was publicly critical of the Federal government's <a href="Dibb%20Report">Dibb Report</a>, claiming that while it contained "sensible policy for the defence of Australia", it did not recognise the ADF's offensive capabilities: "People win wars by taking the initiative. In war the aim must be to win. ... If you are a small force you cannot afford to wait, and otherwise you will be defeated." Evans also stood for political office, running as the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal</a> candidate for the seat of <a href="Eden-Monaro">Eden-Monaro</a>, New South Wales, in the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201987">1987 Australian federal election</a>. He was competing for the conservative vote with <a href="National%20Party%20of%20Australia">National</a> candidate <a href="Peter%20Cochran%20%28politician%29">Peter Cochran</a>, whose party advertising was considered to have outperformed the Liberals'. The seat was retained by incumbent <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labor</a> member <a href="Jim%20Snow">Jim Snow</a>.

In 1990, Evans published his critique of Australian defence policies, "A Fatal Rivalry: Australia's Defence at Risk"; he followed this in 2000 with "War: A Matter of Principles", featuring contributions from senior soldiers and military analysts. Also in 1990, Evans joined the Board of <a href="BAE%20Systems%20Australia">British Aerospace Australia</a> as a non-executive director, and was later appointed senior defence advisor to BAE Systems Australia, retiring in 2009. From 1997 until 2003, he was chairman of the <a href="National%20Capital%20Authority">National Capital Authority</a>, and from 1999 until 2003 was national president of the <a href="Royal%20United%20Services%20Institute">Royal United Services Institute</a> Australia. Evans has been the patron of numerous organisations including the Airfield Defence Guards Association, the Royal Australian Air Force Association (ACT Division), The Celtic Club Australia, and the Royal Australian Air Force Staff College Association. He was one of three former members of Australia's Berlin Airlift squadron to be specially honoured by the <a href="Berlin">City of Berlin</a> on the 50th anniversary of the Berlin Blockade in 1998. In January 2001 he was awarded the <a href="Centenary%20Medal">Centenary Medal</a> for "service to Australian society through Australian Defence Force and to the Canberra community". He was chairman of the 60th Anniversary Victory in the Pacific Steering Committee in 2005. His autobiography, "Down to Earth", was launched on 19 July 2011 by former Prime Minister <a href="John%20Howard">John Howard</a> at <a href="Old%20Parliament%20House%2C%20Canberra">Old Parliament House, Canberra</a>.

Battle of Schliengen

At the Battle of Schliengen (24 October 1796), both the French <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Rhine%20and%20Moselle">Army of the Rhine and Moselle</a> under the command of <a href="Jean%20Victor%20Marie%20Moreau">Jean-Victor Moreau</a> and the Austrian army under the command of <a href="Archduke%20Charles%2C%20Duke%20of%20Teschen">Archduke Charles</a> of Austria claimed victories. The village of <a href="Schliengen">Schliengen</a> lies in the present-day <a href="Districts%20of%20Germany">Kreis</a> <a href="L%C3%B6rrach%20%28district%29">Lörrach</a> close to the border of present-day <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a> (Germany), the <a href="Haut-Rhin">Haut-Rhin</a> (France), and the <a href="Canton%20of%20Basel-Stadt">Canton of Basel-Stadt</a> (Switzerland).

During the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>, Schliengen was a strategically important location for the armies of both <a href="French%20First%20Republic">Republican France</a> and <a href="Habsburg%20Austria">Habsburg Austria</a>. Control of the area gave either combatant access to southwestern German states and important <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> crossings. On 20 October Moreau retreated from <a href="Freiburg%20im%20Breisgau">Freiburg im Breisgau</a> and established his army along a ridge of hills. The severe condition of the roads prevented Archduke Charles from flanking the French right wing. The French left wing lay too close to the Rhine to outflank, and the French center, positioned in a semi-circle on heights that commanded the terrain below, was unassailable. Instead, he attacked the French flanks directly, and in force, which increased casualties for both sides.

Although the French and the Austrians claimed victory at the time, military historians generally agree that the Austrians achieved a strategic advantage. However, the French withdrew from the battlefield in good order and several days later crossed the Rhine River at <a href="H%C3%BCningen">Hüningen</a>. A confusion of politics and diplomacy in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> wasted any strategic advantage that Charles might have obtained and locked the <a href="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> force into two sieges on the Rhine, when the troops were badly needed in northern Italy. The battle is commemorated on a monument in Vienna and on the <a href="Arc%20de%20Triomphe">Arc de Triomphe</a> in Paris.

Initially, the rulers of Europe viewed the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> as a dispute between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. As revolutionary rhetoric grew more strident, they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of <a href="Louis%20XVI">Louis XVI</a> and his family; this <a href="Declaration%20of%20Pillnitz">Declaration of Pillnitz</a> (27 August 1791) threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. The position of the revolutionaries became increasingly difficult. Compounding their problems in international relations, French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution. Finally, on 20 April 1792, the <a href="French%20National%20Convention">French National Convention</a> declared war on Austria. In this <a href="War%20of%20the%20First%20Coalition">War of the First Coalition</a> (1792–98), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Portugal">Portugal</a> and the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. Despite some victories in 1792, by early 1793, France was in terrible crisis: French forces had been pushed out of Belgium; also there was <a href="revolt%20in%20the%20Vend%C3%A9e">revolt in the Vendée</a> over conscription; wide-spread resentment of the <a href="Civil%20Constitution%20of%20the%20Clergy">Civil Constitution of the Clergy</a>; and the French king had just been executed. The armies of the French Republic were in a state of disruption; the problems became even more acute following the introduction of mass conscription, the "<a href="lev%C3%A9e%20en%20masse">levée en masse</a>", which saturated an already distressed army with thousands of illiterate, untrained men.
For the French, the <a href="Rhine%20Campaign%20of%201795">Rhine Campaign of 1795</a> proved especially disastrous, although they had achieved some success in other theaters of war (see for example, <a href="War%20of%20the%20Pyrenees">War of the Pyrenees</a> (1793–95)).

The armies of the <a href="First%20Coalition">First Coalition</a> included the imperial contingents and the infantry and cavalry of the various states, amounting to about 125,000 (including three autonomous corps), a sizable force by eighteenth century standards but a moderate force by the standards of the Revolutionary wars. In total, though, the commander-in-chief Archduke Charles' troops stretched from Switzerland to the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> and <a href="Dagobert%20Sigmund%20von%20Wurmser">Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser</a>'s, from the Swiss-Italian border to the Adriatic. <a href="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> troops comprised the bulk of the army, but the thin white line of Habsburg infantry could not cover the territory from <a href="Basel">Basel</a> to <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> with sufficient depth to resist the pressure of their opponents. Compared to French coverage, Charles had half the number of troops covering a front that stretched from <a href="Renchen">Renchen</a> near Basel to <a href="Bingen%20am%20Rhein">Bingen.</a> Furthermore, he had concentrated the bulk of his force, commanded by <a href="Theodor%20Franz%2C%20Count%20Baillet%20von%20Latour">Count Baillet Latour</a>, between <a href="Karlsruhe">Karlsruhe</a> and <a href="Darmstadt">Darmstadt</a>, where the confluence of the Rhine and the <a href="Main%20%28river%29">Main</a> made an attack most likely, as it offered a gateway into eastern German states and ultimately to Vienna, with good bridges crossing a relatively well-defined river bank. To his north, <a href="Wilhelm%20von%20Wartensleben">Wilhelm von Wartensleben</a>'s autonomous corps covered the line between Mainz and Giessen. The Austrian army consisted of professionals, many moved from the border regions in the Balkans, and conscripts drafted from the <a href="Imperial%20Circles">Imperial Circles</a>.

Two French generals, <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Jourdan">Jean-Baptiste Jourdan</a> and <a href="Jean%20Victor%20Moreau">Jean Victor Moreau</a>, commanded (respectively) the <a href="Army%20of%20Sambre-et-Meuse">Army of Sambre-et-Meuse</a> and the Army of the Rhine and Moselle at the outset of the 1796 campaign. The French citizens' army, created by <a href="lev%C3%A9e%20en%20masse">mass conscription</a> of young men and systematically divested of old men who might have tempered the rash impulses of teenagers and young adults, and had already made itself odious, by reputation and rumor at least, throughout France. Furthermore, it was an army entirely dependent upon the countryside for its material support. After April 1796, pay was made in metallic value, but pay was still in arrears. Throughout the spring and early summer, the unpaid French army was in almost constant mutiny: in May 1796, in the border town of <a href="Zweibr%C3%BCcken">Zweibrücken</a>, the 74th Demi-brigade revolted. In June, the 17th Demi-brigade was insubordinate (frequently) and in the 84th Demi-brigade, two companies rebelled. The French commanders understood that an assault into the German states was essential, not only in terms of war aims, but also in practical terms: the <a href="French%20Directory">French Directory</a> believed that war should pay for itself, and did not budget for the payment or feeding of its troops.

In Spring, 1796, when resumption of war appeared eminent, the 88 members of the <a href="Swabian%20Circle">Swabian Circle</a>, which included most of the states (ecclesiastical, secular, and dynastic) in Upper Swabia, had raised a small force of about 7,000 men. These were literally raw recruits, field hands and day laborers drafted for service, but usually untrained in military matters. It was largely guess work where they should be placed, and Charles did not like to use the militias in any vital location. Consequently, in early late May and early June, when the French started to mass troops by <a href="Mainz">Mainz</a> as if they would cross there—they even engaged the Imperial force at Altenkirchen (4 June) and Wetzler and Uckerath (15 June)—Charles thought that main attack would occur there and felt few qualms placing the 7,000-man Swabian militia at the crossing by Kehl. On 24 June, though, at Kehl, Moreau's advance guard, 10,000, preceded the main force of 27,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry directed at the Swabian pickets on the bridge. The Swabians were hopelessly outnumbered and could not be reinforced. Most of the Imperial Army of the Rhine was stationed further north, by Mannheim, where the river was easier to cross, but too far away to support the smaller force at Kehl. Neither the Condé's <a href="Army%20of%20Cond%C3%A9">troops</a> in Freiburg nor <a href="Karl%20Aloys%20zu%20F%C3%BCrstenberg">Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg</a>'s force in Rastatt could reach Kehl in time to support them. Within a day, Moreau had four divisions across the river. Thrust out of Kehl, the Swabian contingent reformed at <a href="Rastatt">Rastatt</a> by 5 July. There they managed to hold the city until the French turned both flanks. Charles could not move much of his army away from <a href="Mannheim">Mannheim</a> or Karlsruhe, where the French had also formed across the river, and Fürstenberg could not hold the southern flank. Furthermore, at Hüningen, near Basel, on the same day that Moreau's advance guard crossed at Kehl, Ferino executed a full crossing, and advanced unopposed east along the German shore of the Rhine with the 16th and 50th Demi-brigades, the 68th, 50th and 68th line infantry, and six squadrons of cavalry that included the 3rd and 7th Hussars and the 10th Dragoons.

The Habsburg and Imperial armies were in danger of encirclement, as the French pressed hard at Rastatt. Ferino moved quickly east along the shore of the Rhine; from there, an approach from the rear might have flanked the entire force. To prevent this, Charles executed an orderly withdrawal in four columns through the <a href="Black%20Forest">Black Forest</a>, across the Upper Danube valley, and toward Bavaria, trying to maintain consistent contact with all flanks as each column withdrew through the Black Forest and the Upper Danube. By mid-July, the column encamped near Stuttgart. The third column, which included the Condé's Corps, retreated through <a href="Bad%20Waldsee">Waldsee</a> to <a href="Stockach">Stockach</a>, and eventually <a href="Ravensburg">Ravensburg</a>. The fourth Austrian column, the smallest (three battalions and four squadrons), <a href="Ludwig%20Wolff%20de%20la%20Marselle">Ludwig Wolff de la Marselle</a>, marched the length of the Bodensee's northern shore, via <a href="%C3%9Cberlingen">Überlingen</a>, <a href="Meersburg">Meersburg</a>, <a href="Buchhorn">Buchhorn</a>, and the Austrian city of <a href="Bregenz">Bregenz</a>.

Given the size of the attacking force, Charles had to withdraw far enough into Bavaria to align his northern flank in a perpendicular line with Wartensleben's autonomous corps to protect the Danube valley and deny the French primary access to Vienna. His own front would prevent Moreau from flanking Wartensleben from the south and together they could resist the French onslaught. In the course of this withdrawal, he abandoned the Swabian Circle to the French. For the Swabians to negotiate neutrality, their militia needed to disband. At the end of July, eight thousand of Charles' men executed a dawn attack on the camp of the remaining three thousand Swabian and Condé's immigrant troops, disarmed them, and impounded their weapons. As Charles withdrew further east, the neutral zone established in Swabia expanded, eventually to encompass most of southern German states and the <a href="Ernestine%20duchies">Ernestine duchies</a>.

The summer and fall included various conflicts throughout the southern territories of the German states as the armies of the Coalition and the armies of the Directory sought to flank each other:

By mid-summer, the situation looked grim for the Coalition: Wartensleben continued to withdraw to the east-northeast despite Charles' orders to unite with him. It appeared probable that Jourdan or Moreau would outmaneuver Charles by driving a wedge between his force and that of Wartensleben. At Neresheim on 11 August, Moreau crushed Charles' force, forcing him to withdraw further east. At last, however, with this loss, Wartensleben recognized the danger and changed direction, moving his corps to join at Charles' northern flank. At Amberg on 24 August, Charles inflicted a defeat on the French, yet that same day, his commanders lost a battle to the French at Friedberg. Regardless, the tide had turned in the Coalition's favor. Both Jourdan and Moreau had overstretched their lines, moving far into the German states, and were separated too far from each other for one to offer the other aid or security. The Coalition's concentration of troops forced a wider wedge between the two armies of Jourdan and Moreau, similar to what the French had tried to do to Charles and Wartensleben. As the French withdrew toward the Rhine, Charles and Wartensleben pressed forward. On 3 September at Würzburg, Jourdan attempted to halt his retreat. Once Moreau received word of the French defeat, he had to withdraw from southern Germany. He pulled his troops back through the Black Forest, with Ferino supervising the rear guard. The Austrian corps commanded by <a href="Theodor%20Franz%2C%20Count%20Baillet%20von%20Latour">Latour</a> drew too close to Moreau at Biberach and lost 4,000 men taken as prisoners, some standards and artillery, after which Latour followed at a more prudent distance.

The Rhine River flows west along the border between the German states and the <a href="Cantons%20of%20Switzerland">Swiss Cantons</a>. The <a href="High%20Rhine">High Rhine</a> ("Hochrhein"), the stretch between the <a href="Rhine%20Falls">Rhine Falls</a> near <a href="Schaffhausen">Schaffhausen</a> and Basel, cuts through steep hillsides over a gravel bed; in such places as the former rapids at <a href="Laufenburg%2C%20Aargau">Laufenburg</a>, it moves in torrents. A few miles north and east of Basel, the terrain flattens. The Rhine makes a wide, northerly turn, in what is called the <a href="Rhine%20knee">Rhine knee</a>, and enters the so-called Rhine ditch ("Rheingraben"), part of a <a href="rift%20valley">rift valley</a> bordered by the Black Forest on the east and <a href="Vosges">Vosges</a> mountains on the west. In 1796, the plain on both sides of the river, some wide, was dotted with villages and farms. At the farthest edges of the flood plain, especially on the eastern side, the old mountains created dark shadows on the horizon. Tributaries cut through the hilly terrain of the Black Forest, creating deep defiles in the mountains. The tributaries then wound in rivulets through the flood plain to the river.

The landscape was impressive, but rugged. As a nineteenth-century traveler described it,
the mountains in the vicinity [of <a href="M%C3%BCllheim">Müllheim</a>] are bold; the dark ravines contrasting with its sunny fronts offer some exquisite scenes. The Rhine ... lay revealed before us for many a league, twisting and twining like a serpent of silver ... dotted with innumerable islands, and flowing through a most extensive plain, perfectly flat. Our elevation was considerable and the eye ranged over a great extent of country: <a href="Alsace">Elsace</a> , in France, and the level country as far as Bingen, would have been seen to their furthest limits had not the distance melted the extreme verges into 'thin air'. Many were the villages, and hamlets, and woods sprinkled over the landscape... The traveler described additional walks, in which the forest of dark pine bordered directly on the road, "checquered [sic] by glades in which browsed sheep and goats."

The Rhine River itself looked different in the 1790s than it does today; the passage from Basel to <a href="Iffezheim">Iffezheim</a> was "corrected" (straightened) between 1817 and 1875. Between 1927 and 1975, a canal was constructed to control the water level. In 1790, though, the river was wild and unpredictable, in some places four times wider or more than it is in the twenty-first century, even under regular water levels. Its channels wound through marsh and meadow, and created islands of trees and vegetation that were periodically submerged by floods.

Throughout September and early October, Charles maintained his pressure on Moreau's army, pushing it further to the west. On 18 September, part of an Austrian division under Feldmarschall-Leutnant <a href="Franz%20Petrasch">Petrasch</a> swept from Karlsruhe, south to Kehl and stormed the Rhine bridgehead there; he succeeded in holding it, with high losses (about 2,000 of his 5,000 men were killed, wounded or missing). Immediately, though, <a href="Balthazar%20Alexis%20Henri%20Schauenburg">General Schauenburg</a>, the French garrison commander, counter-attacked and drove the Austrians back; the French lost 1,200 killed or wounded, and 800 captured. Even though the French still held the crossing at Kehl and Strasbourg, Petrasch's Austrians prevented Moreau from using the crossing to escape to France, leaving as his only reliable route to France the bridge at Hüningen. If Moreau, at that point situated in <a href="Freiburg%20im%20Breisgau">Freiburg</a>, withdrew too soon from the <a href="Breisgau">Breisgau</a>, Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino 's column would be trapped there.

The next contact occurred on 19 October at <a href="Battle%20of%20Emmendingen">Emmendingen</a>, in the <a href="Elz%20%28Rhine%29">Elz</a> valley which winds through the Black Forest. The section of the valley involved in the battle runs southwest through the mountains from Elzach, through Bleibach and Waldkirch. Just to the southwest of Waldkirch, the river emerges from the mountains and flows north-west towards the Rhine, with the Black Forest to its right. This section of the river passes through Emmendingen before it reaches <a href="Riegel%20am%20Kaiserstuhl">Riegel</a>. Riegel sits in a narrow gap between the Black Forest and an isolated outcropping of volcanic hills known as the <a href="Kaiserstuhl%20%28Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg%29">Kaiserstuhl</a>. Here the archduke split his force into four columns.

Column Nauendorf, in the upper Elz, had 8 battalions and 14 squadrons, advancing southwest to Waldkirch; column Wartensleben had 12 battalions and 23 squadrons advancing south to capture the Elz bridge at Emmendingen. Latour, with 6,000 men, was to cross the foothills via Heimbach and Malterdingen, and capture the bridge of Köndringen, between Riegel and Emmendingen, and column Fürstenberg held Kinzingen, about north of Riegel. <a href="Michael%20von%20Fr%C3%B6hlich">Michael Fröhlich</a> and Condé (part of <a href="Friedrich%20Joseph%2C%20Count%20of%20Nauendorf">Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf</a>'s column) were to pin down Ferino and the French right wing in the Stieg valley. Nauendorf's men were able to ambush Saint' Cyr's advance; Latour's columns attacked <a href="Michel%20de%20Beaupuy">Beaupuy</a> at Matterdingen, killing the general and throwing his column into confusion. Wartensleben, in the center, was held up by French riflemen until his third (reserve) detachment arrived to outflank them. In the ensuing melee, Wartensleben was mortally wounded. The French retreated across the rivers, destroying all the bridges.

Lack of bridges did not slow the Coalition pursuit. The Austrians repaired the bridges by Matterdingen, and moved on Moreau at Freiburg. On 20 October, Moreau's army of 20,000 united south of Freiburg im Breisgau with Ferino's column. Ferino's force was smaller than Moreau had hoped, bringing the total of the combined French force to about 32,000. Charles' combined forces of 24,000 closely followed Moreau's rear guard from Freiburg, southwest, to a line of hills stretching between <a href="Kandern">Kandern</a> and the river.

After a retreat of approximately in which his rear guard was continually harassed by the vanguard of his enemy, Moreau halted at Schliengen and distributed his army in a semicircle along a ridge that commanded the approaches from Freiburg. He placed his right wing, commanded by Ferino, at the neighboring heights of Kandern (altitude ) and <a href="Sitzenkirch">Sitzenkirch</a>, and his left wing at <a href="Neuenburg%20am%20Rhein">Steinstadt</a>. His center occupied the village of Schliengen (altitude 820 feet or 250 meters), which lay about from the Rhine river. His entire force guarded a front protected by a small stream, the long <a href="Kander%20%28Germany%29">Kander</a> that meandered out of the mountains west of Kandern and plunged into the Rhine when it passed Steinstadt. For extra protection, Moreau also posted a body of infantry in front of his center, giving it added depth. His position on the heights gave him the advantage in any approach; his troops could fire downhill on any advancing troops. The French position, in the chain of abrupt and woody heights, seemed nearly impregnable.

The Austrian army, augmented by the Army of Condé under the prince's command, approached from Freiburg. Charles had a couple of options open to him. Any direct assault on the French position would be costly; Moreau had chosen an almost unassailable position, especially for his center. Any Habsburg force would have to cross the Kandern; in most cases, it would have to advance uphill into withering fire. Charles could avoid a battle by leaving a force to keep the French occupied and directing a part of his army through the mountains to the left of the Kandern, descending into the valley to <a href="Wies">Wies</a> and disrupt the French line with Hüningen. However, this operation would take time, and the roads were bad from the rain, making any such maneuver difficult.

Rather than see his enemy slip from his grasp, Charles decided to turn Moreau's right flank at Kandern. He redistributed the four columns: Condé's Emigré Corps formed the far right column, and Condé's grandson, <a href="Louis%20Antoine%2C%20Duke%20of%20Enghien">Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien</a>, commanded its <a href="tactical%20formation">vanguard</a>; the second column, commanded by the young but reliable Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg, included 9 battalions and 26 squadrons. Charles ordered the first two columns to keep the left wing of the French army in check, preventing it from swinging around his own army's rear in a flanking maneuver. This force also maintained contact with Petrasch's force by Kehl.

The third column, commanded by the experienced <a href="Maximilian%20Anton%20Karl%2C%20Count%20Baillet%20de%20Latour">Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour</a>, included 11 battalions and 2 regiments of cavalry. The fourth, commanded by the dependable Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, included the entire vanguard of Charles' corps and approached on the far Austrian left. The two larger columns, under Latour and Nauendorf, were to attack the French right wing in force, and to turn it so that the French army's back was to the Rhine. This was by far the most grueling of the proposed advances: they would approach the French uphill from them. Nauendorf divided his column into several smaller groups, and approached Kandern from several sides, up the steep slopes, by coordinating contact between his column and Latour's, using <a href="Maximilian%2C%20Count%20of%20Merveldt">Maximilian, Count of Merveldt</a>'s regiment as the link between them.

Condé's Corps formed down river at Neuburg and Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg's column formed at Müllheim. Their role was specific: keep the French left from flanking the main Austrian force. Yet, despite specific orders to the contrary, the Duke of Enghien, Condé's grandson, led a spirited attack on Steinstadt with the Army of Condé; they took the village with a bayonet charge and remained there under severe artillery and musket fire for the rest of the daylight hours. Republican fire continued, incessant and terrible. An officer was killed as he stood between the Royal Highnesses (Condé, his son, and grandson) and the <a href="Charles%20Ferdinand%2C%20Duke%20of%20Berry">Duke of Berry</a>. Taking advantage of the royalist acquisition, the second column took the hill opposite Schliengen, which was heavily defended by General of Division <a href="Gouvion%20Saint-Cyr">Gouvion Saint-Cyr</a>. Saint-Cyr tried several times to retake the position, but Fürstenberg's column clung to its prize throughout the day, despite a heavy cannonade from the French divisions opposite it.

On the opposite side of the battlefield, Latour's column marched through part of the night to Feldburg, passed through Vögisheim at to <a href="Feldberg%2C%20Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Feldberg</a>, after which it separated into two smaller columns. At 07:00, the right column attacked Ferino's positions in two vineyards which lay approximately to the northeast at . This column forced the French to retire behind Liel at , east of Schliengen. The left column, meanwhile, had attacked another position by Egennen. After fierce fighting, Latour's column dislodged the French after obstinate resistance; the second portion of Latour's column approached the hamlet Eckenheim from the reverse angle, and forced a French contingent from the village. Grueling combat followed as the Austrians made the steep, uphill advance.

The greater part of the battle, yet to come, fell to Nauendorf's column. His men had marched all of the preceding night; his column moved with the corps of General Latour to Feldburg, but by the castle of Bürgeln to the east at , it turned to the left (west) to penetrate to the source of the Kandern stream. Finally, by 14:00, two in the afternoon, Nauendorf's column had slogged through mud and muck and came fully into the action. Despite determined opposition, his troops ousted the French from Kandern and <a href="Sitzenkirch">Sitzenkirch</a>, and all the high ground above the river and <a href="Feuerbach%20%28Kandern%29">Feuerbach</a>. The fighting there, between Ferino's and Nauendorf's columns, was intense and horrific: Moreau later recounted that Ferino's troops performed "prodigies of valor" from daybreak to nightfall. When Nauendorf finished pushing the French from Kandern, and two hamlets beside it, and he sent a note with this information to Latour. As the battle finished, a ferocious storm unleashed hail and wind. So ended the first day of the battle during which Charles' army had successfully ousted both French flanks from their positions. Overnight, Charles drew up his plans to attack the French center on the following morning. It promised to be a long and bloody second day.

Moreau appreciated his untenable position, especially on his right where the bulk of Charles' force stood ready to attack again in the morning. The Austrian army occupied a line which passed obliquely across the extremity of his right, and another line which passed along his left; they both intersected in front of him, where the main force of Charles' army blocked any movement forward. With luck, his troops might hold the Austrians off another day, but there were hazards: principally, the Austrians could break either wing, swing behind him and cut him off from the bridge at Hüningen, which was his only escape route back to France. Consequently, that night he withdrew his right wing to the heights of <a href="Tannenkirch">Tannenkirch</a> at , a position scarcely less impregnable than that which it had abandoned. With a strong rear guard provided by <a href="Jean%20Charles%20Abbatucci">Abbatucci</a> and <a href="Jean%20Ambroise%20Baston%20de%20Lariboisi%C3%A8re">Lariboisière</a>, he abandoned his position the same night and retreated part of the to Hüningen. The right and left wings followed. By 3 November he had reached <a href="Haltingen">Haltingen</a> and evacuated his troops over the bridge into France.

With their backs to the river, Ferino and Moreau had to retreat across the Rhine into France, but retained control of the fortifications at Kehl and Hüningen and, more importantly, the "<a href="Bridgehead">tête-du-ponts</a>" of the star-shaped <a href="Star%20fort">fortresses</a> where the bridges crossed the river. Moreau offered an armistice to Charles, which the archduke was inclined to accept. He wanted to secure the Rhine crossings and send troops to northern Italy to relieve Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser at besieged <a href="Siege%20of%20Mantua%20%281796%E2%80%9397%29">Mantua</a>; an armistice with Moreau would allow him to do that. However, his brother, Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, and the civilian military advisers of the Aulic Council categorically refused such an armistice, forcing Charles to order simultaneous sieges at <a href="Siege%20of%20Kehl%20%281796%E2%80%9397%29">Kehl</a> and <a href="Siege%20of%20H%C3%BCningen">Hüningen</a>. These tied his army to the Rhine for most of the winter. He moved north with the bulk of his force to invest Kehl, and instructed Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg to conduct the siege in the south by Basel. While the Austrians besieged these Rhine crossings, Moreau had sufficient surplus troops to send 14 demi-brigades (approximately 12,000 troops) into Italy to assist in the siege at Mantua.

Hope (painting)

Hope is a <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">Symbolist</a> <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> by the English painter <a href="George%20Frederic%20Watts">George Frederic Watts</a>, who completed the first two versions in 1886. Radically different from previous treatments of the subject, it shows a lone blindfolded female figure sitting on a globe, playing a <a href="lyre">lyre</a> that has only a single string remaining. The background is almost blank, its only visible feature a single star. Watts intentionally used symbolism not traditionally associated with hope to make the painting's meaning ambiguous. While his use of colour in "Hope" was greatly admired, at the time of its exhibition many critics disliked the painting. "Hope" proved popular with the <a href="Aesthetic%20Movement">Aesthetic Movement</a>, who considered beauty the primary purpose of art and were unconcerned by the ambiguity of its message. Reproductions in <a href="platinotype">platinotype</a>, and later cheap <a href="carbon%20print">carbon print</a>s, soon began to be sold.

Although Watts received many offers to buy the painting, he had agreed to donate his most important works to the nation and felt it would be inappropriate not to include "Hope". Consequently, later in 1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a second version. On its completion Watts sold the original and donated the copy to the <a href="South%20Kensington%20Museum">South Kensington Museum</a> (now the Victoria and Albert Museum); thus, this second version is better known than the original. He painted at least two further versions for private sale.

As cheap reproductions of "Hope", and from 1908 high-quality prints, began to circulate in large quantities, it became a widely popular image. President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> displayed a copy at his <a href="Sagamore%20Hill%20%28house%29">Sagamore Hill</a> home in New York; reproductions circulated worldwide; and a 1922 film depicted Watts's creation of the painting and an imagined story behind it. By this time "Hope" was coming to seem outdated and sentimental, and Watts was rapidly falling out of fashion. In 1938 the <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a> ceased to keep their collection of Watts's works on permanent display.

Despite the decline in Watts's popularity, "Hope" remained influential. <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> based a 1959 sermon, now known as "Shattered Dreams", on the theme of the painting, as did <a href="Jeremiah%20Wright">Jeremiah Wright</a> in Chicago in 1990. Among the congregation for the latter was the young <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>, who was deeply moved. Obama took "The Audacity of Hope" as the theme of his <a href="2004%20Democratic%20National%20Convention%20keynote%20address">2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address</a>, and as the title of his <a href="The%20Audacity%20of%20Hope">2006 book</a>; he based his successful <a href="Barack%20Obama%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008">2008 presidential campaign</a> around the theme of "Hope".

<a href="George%20Frederic%20Watts">George Frederic Watts</a> was born in London in 1817, the son of a musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823 and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Meanwhile, his father's strict <a href="evangelical%20Christianity">evangelical Christianity</a> led to both a deep knowledge of the Bible and a strong dislike of organised religion. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and six years later was proficient enough as an artist to earn a living as a portrait painter and <a href="cricket">cricket</a> illustrator. Aged 18 he gained admission to the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20schools">Royal Academy schools</a>, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. In 1837 Watts was commissioned by Greek shipping magnate <a href="Alexander%20Constantine%20Ionides">Alexander Constantine Ionides</a> to copy a portrait of his father by <a href="Samuel%20Lane">Samuel Lane</a>; Ionides preferred Watts's version to the original and immediately commissioned two more paintings from him, allowing Watts to devote himself full-time to painting.

In 1843 he travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from depression and painted a number of notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded. In 1867 he was elected a <a href="Royal%20Academician">Royal Academician</a>, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with the culture of the Royal Academy. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at <a href="Little%20Holland%20House">Little Holland House</a>, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame. In 1884 a selection of 50 of his works was shown at New York's <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>.

Hope is traditionally considered by Christians as a <a href="Theological%20virtues">theological virtue</a> (a virtue associated with the <a href="Grace%20in%20Christianity">grace of God</a>, rather than with work or self-improvement). Since antiquity artistic representations of the personification depict her as a young woman, typically holding a flower or an anchor.

During Watts's lifetime, European culture had begun to question the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The <a href="Long%20Depression">Long Depression</a> of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, and the importance of material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless.
In late 1885 Watts's adopted daughter Blanche Clogstoun had just lost her infant daughter Isabel to illness, and Watts wrote to a friend that "I see nothing but uncertainty, contention, conflict, beliefs unsettled and nothing established in place of them." Watts set out to reimagine the depiction of Hope in a society in which economic decline and environmental deterioration were increasingly leading people to question the notion of progress and the existence of God.

Other artists of the period had already begun to experiment with alternative methods of depicting Hope in art. Some, such as the upcoming young painter <a href="Evelyn%20De%20Morgan">Evelyn De Morgan</a>, drew on the imagery of <a href="Psalm%20137">Psalm 137</a> and its description of exiled musicians refusing to play for their captors. Meanwhile, <a href="Edward%20Burne-Jones">Edward Burne-Jones</a>, a friend of Watts who specialised in painting mythological and allegorical topics, in 1871 completed the <a href="Modello">cartoon</a> for a planned <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> window depicting Hope for St Margaret's Church in <a href="Hopton-on-Sea">Hopton-on-Sea</a>. Burne-Jones's design showed Hope upright and defiant in a prison cell, holding a <a href="Aaron%27s%20rod">flowering rod</a>.

Watts generally worked on his allegorical paintings on and off over an extended period, but it appears that "Hope" was completed relatively quickly. He left no notes regarding his creation of the work, but his close friend Emilie Barrington noted that "a beautiful friend of mine", almost certainly <a href="Dorothy%20Dene">Dorothy Dene</a>, modelled for "Hope" in 1885. (Dorothy Dene, née Ada Alice Pullen, was better known as a model for <a href="Frederic%20Leighton">Frederic Leighton</a> but is known to have also modelled for Watts in this period. Although the facial features of "Hope" are obscured in Watts's painting, her distinctive jawline and hair are both recognisable.) By the end of 1885 Watts had settled on the design of the painting.

"Hope" shows its central character alone, with no other human figures visible and without her traditional fellow virtues, Love (also known as Charity) and Faith. She is dressed in <a href="Classical%20antiquity">classical</a> costume, based on the <a href="Elgin%20Marbles">Elgin Marbles</a>; Nicholas Tromans of <a href="Kingston%20University">Kingston University</a> speculated that her Greek style of clothing was intentionally chosen to evoke the ambivalent nature of hope in Greek mythology over the certainties of Christian tradition. Her pose is based on that of <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>'s "<a href="Night%20%28Michelangelo%29">Night</a>", in an intentionally strained position. She sits on a small, imperfect orange globe with wisps of cloud around its circumference, against an almost blank mottled blue background. The figure is illuminated faintly from behind, as if by starlight, and also directly from the front as if the observer is the source of light. Watts's use of light and tone avoids the clear definition of shapes, creating a shimmering and dissolving effect more typically associated with <a href="pastel">pastel</a> work than with oil painting.

The design bears close similarities to Burne-Jones's "Luna" (painted in watercolour 1870 and in oils  1872–1875), which also shows a female figure in classical drapery on a globe surrounded by clouds. As with many of Watts's works the style of the painting was rooted in the European <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">Symbolist</a> movement, but also drew heavily on the <a href="Venetian%20school%20%28art%29">Venetian school</a> of painting. Other works which have been suggested as possible influences on "Hope" include Burne-Jones's "The Wheel of Fortune" (c. 1870), <a href="Albert%20Joseph%20Moore">Albert Moore</a>'s "Beads" (1875), <a href="Dante%20Gabriel%20Rossetti">Dante Gabriel Rossetti</a>'s "<a href="A%20Sea%E2%80%93Spell">A Sea–Spell</a>" (1877), and "The Throne of Saturn" by <a href="Elihu%20Vedder">Elihu Vedder</a> (1884).
"Hope" is closely related to "Idle Child of Fancy", completed by Watts in 1885, which also shows a personification of one of the traditional virtues (in this case Love) sitting on a cloud-shrouded globe. In traditional depictions of the virtues, Love was shown blindfolded while Hope was not; in "Hope" and "Idle Child" Watts reversed this imagery, depicting Love looking straight ahead and Hope as blind. It is believed to be the first time a European artist depicted Hope as blind.

The figure of Hope holds a broken <a href="lyre">lyre</a>, based on an ancient Athenian wood and tortoiseshell lyre then on display in the British Museum. Although broken musical instruments were a frequently occurring motif in European art, they had never previously been associated with Hope. Hope's lyre has only a single string remaining, on which she attempts to play. She strains to listen to the sound of the single unbroken string, symbolising both persistence and fragility, and the closeness of hope and despair. Watts had recently shown interest in the idea of a continuity between the visual arts and music, and had previously made use of musical instruments as a way to invigorate the subjects of his portraits.

Above the central figure shines a single small star at the very top of the picture, serving as a symbol of further hope beyond that of the central figure herself. The distance of the star from the central figure, and the fact that it is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.

Although the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20Summer%20Exhibition">Royal Academy Summer Exhibition</a> was traditionally the most prestigious venue for English artists to display their new material, Watts chose to exhibit "Hope" at the smaller <a href="Grosvenor%20Gallery">Grosvenor Gallery</a>. In 1882 the Grosvenor Gallery had staged a <a href="retrospective%20exhibition">retrospective exhibition</a> of Watts's work and he felt an attachment to the venue. Also, at this time the Grosvenor Gallery was generally more receptive than the Royal Academy to experimentation. "Hope" was given the prime spot in the exhibition, in the centre of the gallery's longest wall.

Watts's use of colour was an immediate success with critics; even those who otherwise disliked the piece were impressed by Watts's skilful use of colour, tone and harmony. Its subject and Watts's technique immediately drew criticism from the press. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" described it as "one of the most interesting of [Watts's] recent pictures" but observed that while "in point of colour Mr. Watts has seldom given us anything more lovely and delicate ... and there is great beauty in the drawing, though it must be owned that the angles are too many and too marked". "The Portfolio" praised Watts's "Repentance of Cain" but thought "Hope" "a poetic but somewhat inferior composition". <a href="Theodore%20Child">Theodore Child</a> of "<a href="The%20Fortnightly%20Review">The Fortnightly Review</a>" dismissed "Hope" as "a ghastly and apocalyptic allegory", while the highly regarded critic <a href="Claude%20Phillips">Claude Phillips</a> considered it "an exquisite concept, insufficiently realised by a failed execution".

Despite its initial rejection by critics, "Hope" proved immediately popular with many in the then-influential <a href="Aesthetic%20Movement">Aesthetic Movement</a>, who considered beauty the primary purpose of art. Watts, who saw art as a medium for moral messages, strongly disliked the doctrine of "art for art's sake", but the followers of Aestheticism greatly admired Watts's use of colour and symbolism in "Hope". Soon after its exhibition poems based on the image began to be published, and <a href="platinotype">platinotype</a> reproductions—at the time the photographic process best able to capture subtle variations in tone—became popular. The first platinotype reproductions of "Hope" were produced by <a href="Henry%20Herschel%20Hay%20Cameron">Henry Herschel Hay Cameron</a>, son of Watts's close friend <a href="Julia%20Margaret%20Cameron">Julia Margaret Cameron</a>.

Because "Hope" was a work that was impossible to read using the traditional interpretation of symbolism in painting, Watts intentionally left its meaning ambiguous, and the bleaker interpretations were almost immediately challenged by Christian thinkers following its exhibition. Scottish theologian <a href="P.%20T.%20Forsyth">P. T. Forsyth</a> felt that "Hope" was a companion to Watts's 1885 "<a href="Mammon%20%28painting%29">Mammon</a>" in depicting false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them in the absence of faith. Forsyth wrote that the image conveyed the absence of faith, illustrated that a loss of faith placed too great a burden on hope alone, and that the message of the painting was that in the godless world created by technology, Hope has intentionally blinded herself and listens only to that music she can make on her own. Forsyth's interpretation, that the central figure is not herself a personification of hope but a representation of humanity too horrified at the world it has created to look at it, instead deliberately blinding itself and living in hope, became popular with other theologians.

Watts's supporters claimed that the image of "Hope" had near-miraculous redemptive powers. In his 1908 work "Sermons in Art by the Great Masters", <a href="Stoke%20Newington">Stoke Newington</a> Presbyterian minister James Burns wrote of a woman who had been walking to the Thames with the intention of suicide, but had passed the image of "Hope" in a shop window and been so inspired by the sight of it that rather than attempting suicide she instead emigrated to Australia. In 1918 Watts's biographer <a href="Henry%20William%20Shrewsbury">Henry William Shrewsbury</a> wrote of "a poor girl, character-broken and heart-broken, wandering about the streets of London with a growing feeling that nothing remained but to destroy herself" seeing a photograph of "Hope", using the last of her money to buy the photograph, until "looking at it every day, the message sank into her soul, and she fought her way back to a life of purity and honour". When <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> star <a href="Marie%20Lloyd">Marie Lloyd</a> died in 1922 after a life beset with alcohol, illness and depression, it was noted that among her possessions was a print of "Hope"; one reporter observed that among her other possessions, it looked "like a good deed in a naughty world".

Watts himself was ambivalent when questioned about the religious significance of the image, saying that "I made Hope blind so expecting nothing", although after his death his widow <a href="Mary%20Fraser%20Tytler">Mary Seton Watts</a> wrote that the message of the painting was that "Faith must be the companion of Hope. Faith is the substance, the assurance of things hoped for, because it is the evidence of things not seen." Malcolm Warner, curator of the <a href="Yale%20Center%20for%20British%20Art">Yale Center for British Art</a>, interpreted the work differently, writing in 1996 that "the quiet sound of the lyre's single string is all that is left of the full music of religious faith; those who still listen are blindfolded in the sense that, even if real reasons for Hope exist, they cannot see them; Hope remains a virtue, but in the age of scientific materialism a weak and ambiguous one".
In 1900, shortly before his death, Watts again painted the character in "Faith, Hope and Charity" (now in the <a href="Hugh%20Lane%20Gallery">Hugh Lane Gallery</a>, Dublin). This shows her smiling and with her lyre restrung, working with Love to persuade a blood-stained Faith to sheath her sword; Tromans writes that "the message would appear to be that if Faith is going to resume her importance for humanity ... it will have to be in a role deferential to the more constant Love and Hope."

By the time "Hope" was exhibited, Watts had already committed himself to donate his most significant works to the nation, and although he received multiple offers for the painting he thought it inappropriate not to include "Hope" in this donation, in light of the fact that it was already being considered one of his most important pictures. In mid-1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a duplicate of the piece, with the intention that this duplicate be donated to the nation allowing him to sell the original. Although the composition of this second painting is identical, it is radically different in feel. The central figure is smaller in relation to the globe, and the colours darker and less sumptuous, giving it an intentionally gloomier feel than the original.

In late 1886 this second version was one of nine paintings donated to the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">South Kensington Museum</a> (now the Victoria and Albert Museum) in the first instalment of Watts's gift to the nation. Meanwhile, the original was briefly displayed in Nottingham before being sold to the <a href="steam%20tractor">steam tractor</a> entrepreneur <a href="Joseph%20Ruston">Joseph Ruston</a> in 1887. Its whereabouts was long unknown until in 1986 it was auctioned at <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a> for £869,000 (about £ in 2019 terms), 100 years after its first exhibition.

On their donation to the South Kensington Museum, the nine works donated by Watts were hung on the staircase leading to the library, but "Hope" proved a popular loan to other institutions as a symbol of current British art. At the <a href="Royal%20Jubilee%20Exhibition">Royal Jubilee Exhibition</a> of 1887 in Manchester, an entire wall was dedicated to the works of Watts. "Hope", only recently completed but already the most famous of Watts's works, was placed at the centre of this display. It was then exhibited at the 1888 <a href="Melbourne%20Centennial%20Exhibition">Melbourne Centennial Exhibition</a> and the 1889 <a href="Exposition%20Universelle%20%281889%29">Exposition Universelle</a> in Paris, before being moved to Munich for display at the <a href="Glaspalast%20%28Munich%29">Glaspalast</a>. In 1897 it was one of the 17 Watts works transferred to the newly created <a href="Tate%20Gallery">National Gallery of British Art</a> (commonly known as the Tate Gallery, now Tate Britain); at the time, Watts was so highly regarded that an entire room of the new museum was dedicated to his works. The Tate Gallery considered "Hope" one of the highlights of their collection and did not continue the South Kensington Museum's practice of lending the piece to overseas exhibitions.

Needing funds to pay for his new house and studio in <a href="Compton%2C%20Guildford">Compton, Surrey</a>, now the <a href="Watts%20Gallery">Watts Gallery</a>, Watts produced further copies of "Hope" for private sale. A small version was sold to a private collector in Manchester at some point between 1886 and 1890, and was exhibited at the Free Picture Exhibition in <a href="Canning%20Town">Canning Town</a> (an annual event organised by <a href="Samuel%20Barnett%20%28reformer%29">Samuel Barnett</a> and <a href="Henrietta%20Barnett">Henrietta Barnett</a> in an effort to bring beauty into the lives of the poor) in 1897. It is now in the <a href="Iziko%20South%20African%20National%20Gallery">Iziko South African National Gallery</a>, Cape Town. Another version, in which Watts included a rainbow surrounding the central figure to reduce the bleakness of the image, was bought by Richard Budgett, a widower whose wife had been a great admirer of Watts, and remained in the possession of the family until 1997. Watts gave his initial <a href="oil%20sketch">oil sketch</a> to Frederic Leighton; it has been in the collection of the <a href="Walker%20Art%20Gallery">Walker Art Gallery</a>, Liverpool since 1923. Watts is thought to have painted at least one further version, but its location is unknown.

Although <a href="Victorian%20painting">Victorian painting</a> styles went out of fashion soon after Watts's death, "Hope" has remained extremely influential. Mark Bills, curator of the Watts Gallery, described "Hope" as "the most famous and influential" of all Watts's paintings and "a jewel of the late nineteenth-century Symbolist movement". In 1889 socialist agitator <a href="John%20Burns">John Burns</a> visited Samuel and Henrietta Barnett in Whitechapel, and saw a photograph of "Hope" among their possessions. After Henrietta explained its significance to him, efforts were made by the coalition of workers' groups which were to become the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> to recruit Watts. Although determined to stay outside of politics, Watts wrote in support of striking <a href="busman">busmen</a> in 1891, and in 1895 donated a chalk reproduction of "Hope" to the <a href="Missions%20to%20Seamen">Missions to Seamen</a> in <a href="Poplar%2C%20London">Poplar</a> in support of London dock workers. (This is believed to be the red chalk version of "Hope" now in the Watts Gallery.) The passivity of Watts's depiction of Hope drew criticism from some within the socialist movement, who saw her as embodying an unwillingness to commit to action. The prominent art critic <a href="Charles%20Lewis%20Hind">Charles Lewis Hind</a> also loathed this passivity, writing in 1902 that "It is not a work that the robust admire, but the solitary and the sad find comfort in it. It reflects the pretty, pitiable, forlorn hope of those who are cursed with a low vitality, and poor physical health".

Henry Cameron's platinotype reproductions of the first version of "Hope" had circulated since the painting's exhibition, but were slow to produce and expensive to buy. From the early 1890s photographer <a href="Frederick%20Hollyer">Frederick Hollyer</a> produced large numbers of cheap platinotype reproductions of the second version, particularly after Hollyer formalised his business relationship with Watts in 1896. Hollyer sold the reproductions both via <a href="printsellers">printsellers</a> around the country and directly via catalogue, and the print proved extremely popular.

In 1895 Frederic Leighton based his painting "<a href="Flaming%20June">Flaming June</a>", which also depicted Dorothy Dene, on the composition of Watts's "Hope". "Flaming June" kept the central figure's pose, but showing her as relaxed and sleeping. Dene had worked closely with Leighton since the 1880s, and was left the then huge sum of £5000 (about £ in 2019 terms) in Leighton's will when he died the following year. By this time, "Hope" was becoming an <a href="cultural%20icon">icon</a> of English popular culture, propelled by the wide distribution of reproductions; in 1898, a year after the opening of the Tate Gallery, its director noted that "Hope" was one of the two most popular works in their collection among students.

As the 20th century began, the increasingly influential <a href="modernism">Modernist movement</a> drew its inspiration from <a href="Paul%20C%C3%A9zanne">Paul Cézanne</a> and had little regard for 19th-century British painting. Watts drew particular dislike from English critics, and "Hope" came to be seen as a passing fad, emblematic of the excessive sentimentality and poor taste of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By 1904 author <a href="E.%20Nesbit">E. Nesbit</a> used "Hope" as a symbol of poor taste in her short story "The Flying Lodger", describing it as "a blind girl sitting on an orange", a description which would later be popularised by <a href="Agatha%20Christie">Agatha Christie</a> in her 1942 novel "<a href="Five%20Little%20Pigs">Five Little Pigs</a>" (also known as "Murder in Retrospect").
Although Watts's work was seen as outdated and sentimental by the English Modernist movement, his experimentation with Symbolism and <a href="Expressionism">Expressionism</a> drew respect from the European Modernists, notably the young <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>, who echoed "Hope's" intentionally distorted features and broad sweeps of blue in "<a href="The%20Old%20Guitarist">The Old Guitarist</a>" (1903–1904). Despite Watts's fading reputation at home, by the time of his death in 1904 "Hope" had become a globally recognised image. Reproductions circulated in cultures as diverse as Japan, Australia and Poland, and <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, President of the United States, displayed a reproduction in his <a href="Summer%20White%20House">Summer White House</a> at <a href="Sagamore%20Hill%20%28house%29">Sagamore Hill</a>. By 1916, "Hope" was well-known enough in the United States that the stage directions for <a href="Angelina%20Weld%20Grimk%C3%A9">Angelina Weld Grimké</a>'s "<a href="Rachel%20%28play%29">Rachel</a>" explicitly use the addition of a copy of "Hope" to the set to suggest improvements to the home over the passage of time.

Some were beginning to see it as embodying sentimentality and bad taste, but "Hope" continued to remain popular with the English public. In 1905 "<a href="The%20Strand%20Magazine">The Strand Magazine</a>" noted that it was the most popular picture in the Tate Gallery, and remarked that "there are few print-sellers who fail to exhibit it in their windows." After Watts's death the Autotype Company purchased from Mary Seton Watts the rights to make <a href="carbon%20print">carbon print</a> copies of "Hope", making reproductions of the image affordable for poorer households, and in 1908 engraver <a href="Emery%20Walker">Emery Walker</a> began to sell full-colour <a href="photogravure">photogravure</a> prints of "Hope", the first publicly available high-quality colour reproductions of the image.

In 1922 the American film "<a href="Hope%20%281922%20film%29">Hope</a>", directed by <a href="Lejaren%20Hiller%2C%20Sr.">Legaren à Hiller</a> and starring <a href="Mary%20Astor">Mary Astor</a> and <a href="Ralph%20Faulkner">Ralph Faulkner</a>, was based on the imagined origins of the painting. In it Joan, a fisherman's wife, is treated poorly by the rest of her village in her husband's absence, and has only the hope of his return to cling to. His ship returns but bursts into flames, before he is washed up safe and well on shore. The story is interspersed with scenes of Watts explaining the story to a model, and with stills of the painting. By the time the film was released, the fad for prints of "Hope" was long over, to the extent that references to it had become verbal shorthand for authors and artists wanting to indicate that a scene was set in the 1900s–1910s. Watts's reputation continued to fade as artistic tastes changed, and in 1938 the Tate Gallery removed their collection of Watts's works from permanent display.

Despite the steep decline in Watts's popularity, "Hope" continued to hold a place in popular culture, and there remained those who considered it a major work. When the Tate Gallery held an exhibition of its Watts holdings in 1954, trade unionist and left-wing M.P. <a href="Percy%20Collick">Percy Collick</a> urged "Labour stalwarts" to attend the exhibition, supposedly privately recounting that he had recently met a Viennese Jewish woman who during "the terrors of the Nazi War" had drawn "renewed faith and hope" from her photographic copy. Meanwhile, an influential 1959 sermon by <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a>, now known as "Shattered Dreams", took "Hope" as a symbol of frustrated ambition and the knowledge that few people live to see their wishes fulfilled, arguing that "shattered dreams are a hallmark of our mortal life", and against retreating into either apathetic cynicism, a fatalistic belief in God's will or escapist fantasy in response to failure.

Myths continued to grow about supposed beliefs in the redemptive powers of "Hope", and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in the <a href="Six-Day%20War">Six-Day War</a>, the Egyptian government issued copies of it to its troops. There is no evidence this took place, and the story is likely to stem from the fact that in early 1974, shortly after the <a href="Yom%20Kippur%20War">Yom Kippur War</a> between Israel and Egypt, the image of "Hope" appeared on Jordanian postage stamps. Likewise, it is regularly claimed that <a href="Nelson%20Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> kept a print of "Hope" in his cell on <a href="Robben%20Island">Robben Island</a>, a claim for which there is no evidence.

In 1990 <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>, at the time a student at <a href="Harvard%20Law%20School">Harvard Law School</a>, attended a sermon at the <a href="Trinity%20United%20Church%20of%20Christ">Trinity United Church of Christ</a> preached by <a href="Jeremiah%20Wright">Jeremiah Wright</a>. Taking the <a href="Books%20of%20Samuel">Books of Samuel</a> as a starting point, Wright explained that he had studied Watts's "Hope" in the 1950s, and had rediscovered the painting when Dr Frederick G. Sampson delivered a lecture on it in the late 1980s (Sampson described it as "a study in contradictions"), before discussing the image's significance in the modern world.

Wright's sermon left a great impression on Obama, who recounted Wright's sermon in detail in his memoir "<a href="Dreams%20from%20My%20Father">Dreams from My Father</a>". Soon after "Dreams From My Father" was published he went into politics, entering the <a href="Illinois%20Senate%20career%20of%20Barack%20Obama">Illinois Senate</a>. In 2004 he was chosen to deliver the keynote address at the <a href="2004%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">2004 Democratic National Convention</a>. In Obama's 2006 memoir "<a href="The%20Audacity%20of%20Hope">The Audacity of Hope</a>", he recollects that on being chosen to deliver this speech, he pondered the topics on which he had previously campaigned, and on major issues then affecting the nation, before thinking about the variety of people he had met while campaigning, all endeavouring in different ways to improve their own lives and to serve their country.

<a href="2004%20Democratic%20National%20Convention%20keynote%20address">Obama's speech</a>, on the theme of "The Audacity of Hope", was extremely well received. Obama was <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Illinois%2C%202004">elected to the U.S. Senate</a> later that year, and two years later published a second volume of memoirs, also titled "The Audacity of Hope". Obama continued to campaign on the theme of "hope", and in his <a href="Barack%20Obama%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008">2008 presidential campaign</a> his staff requested that artist <a href="Shepard%20Fairey">Shepard Fairey</a> amend the wording of an independently produced poster he had created, combining an image of Obama and the word , to instead read . <a href="Barack%20Obama%20%26quot%3BHope%26quot%3B%20poster">The resulting poster</a> came to be viewed as the iconic image of Obama's ultimately successful election campaign. In light of Obama's well-known interest in Watts's painting, and amid concerns over a perceived dislike of the British, in the last days of <a href="Brown%20ministry">Gordon Brown's government</a> historian and Labour Party activist <a href="Tristram%20Hunt">Tristram Hunt</a> proposed that "Hope" be transferred to the White House. According to an unverified report in the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>", the offer was made but rejected by Obama, who wished to distance himself from Jeremiah Wright following <a href="Jeremiah%20Wright%20controversy">controversial remarks</a> made by Wright.

"Hope" remains Watts's best known work, and formed the theme of the opening ceremony of the <a href="1998%20Winter%20Paralympics">1998 Winter Paralympics</a> in <a href="Nagano%2C%20Nagano">Nagano</a>. In recognition of its continued significance, a major redevelopment of the <a href="Watts%20Gallery">Watts Gallery</a> completed in 2011 was named the Hope Appeal.

Milos Raonic

Milos Raonic (; born December 27, 1990) is a Canadian professional <a href="tennis%20player">tennis player</a>. He reached a career-high <a href="Association%20of%20Tennis%20Professionals">Association of Tennis Professionals</a> (ATP) world No. 3 <a href="Singles%20%28tennis%29">singles</a> <a href="ATP%20Rankings">ranking</a> on November 21, 2016. 

His career highlights include a <a href="Grand%20Slam%20%28tennis%29">Grand Slam</a> final at the <a href="2016%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">2016 Wimbledon Championships</a>; two Grand Slam semifinals at the <a href="2014%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">2014 Wimbledon Championships</a> and <a href="2016%20Australian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">2016 Australian Open</a>; and three <a href="ATP%20World%20Tour%20Masters%201000">ATP World Tour Masters 1000</a> finals at the <a href="2013%20Rogers%20Cup%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">2013 Canadian Open</a>, <a href="2014%20BNP%20Paribas%20Masters%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">2014 Paris Masters</a>, and <a href="2016%20BNP%20Paribas%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">2016 Indian Wells Masters</a>.

Raonic first gained international acclaim by reaching the fourth round of the <a href="2011%20Australian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">2011 Australian Open</a> as a <a href="2011%20Australian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles%20Qualifying">qualifier</a>, being referred to as "the real deal", "a new star", part of "a new generation", and "a future superstar". Coupled with his first <a href="ATP%20World%20Tour">ATP World Tour</a> title three weeks later, his world ranking rose from No. 152 to No. 37 in one month. He was awarded the 2011 <a href="ATP%20World%20Tour%20Awards">ATP Newcomer of the Year</a>. Raonic is the first player born in the 1990s to win an ATP World Tour title, to be ranked in the top 10, and to qualify for the <a href="2014%20ATP%20World%20Tour%20Finals">ATP World Tour Finals</a>. He has eight ATP World Tour titles.

Raonic is the most successful Canadian singles player in history. He became the highest-ranked Canadian male ever on February 21, 2011, when he reached No. 37. His career-high No. 3 ranking is the highest by a Canadian man or woman. He is the first Canadian male in the <a href="Open%20Era%20%28tennis%29">Open Era</a> to reach the <a href="Australian%20Open">Australian Open</a> semifinals, the <a href="French%20Open">French Open</a> quarterfinals, and the <a href="The%20Championships%2C%20Wimbledon">Wimbledon</a> final. He has more ATP World Tour titles and finals appearances in the Open Era than all other Canadian men combined.

Raonic is frequently described as having one of the best <a href="Serve%20%28tennis%29">serves</a> among his contemporaries. Statistically, Raonic is among the strongest servers in the Open Era, winning 91% of <a href="service%20game">service game</a>s to rank third all-time. Aided by his serve, he plays an <a href="all-court">all-court</a> style with an emphasis on short <a href="Point%20%28tennis%29">points</a>. Every one of his singles titles has been won on <a href="hardcourt">hard courts</a>. His overall winning percentage of 68.5% is one of the highest amongst currently active players. 

Raonic was born on December 27, 1990, in <a href="Titograd">Titograd</a>, <a href="SFR%20Yugoslavia">SFR Yugoslavia</a> (now <a href="Podgorica">Podgorica</a>, <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>), and is of <a href="Serbs%20of%20Montenegro">Serb</a> heritage. Prompted by the <a href="Yugoslav%20Wars">political unrest in the Balkans</a>, and seeking more professional opportunities, his family moved to Canada in 1994 when he was three, settling in <a href="Brampton">Brampton, Ontario</a>, a northwest suburb of <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>. His parents are both engineers; his father, Dušan, holds a <a href="Ph.D.">Ph.D.</a> in electrical engineering, while his mother, Vesna, has degrees in mechanical and computer engineering, including a <a href="master%27s%20degree">master's</a>. He has two siblings, both significantly older: his sister, Jelena, has a master's degree in international trade and finance and is eleven years older, while his brother, Momir, has a degree in information technology and business and is nine years older. Raonic's uncle, <a href="Branimir%20Gvozdenovi%C4%87">Branimir Gvozdenović</a>, is a politician in the <a href="Government%20of%20Montenegro">Government of Montenegro</a>, where he has served as <a href="Deputy%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20Montenegro">Deputy Prime Minister</a>. Raonic is fluent in Serbian and English.

His first, brief introduction to tennis came at age six or seven with a week-long tennis camp at the Bramalea Tennis Club in Brampton, followed by weekly hour-long group sessions led by tennis coach Steve Gibson, who recognized his potential. He moved to nearby <a href="Thornhill%2C%20Ontario">Thornhill, Ontario</a> soon after, and one or two years passed before he asked his parents if he could play again. His father sought out coach Casey Curtis at the Blackmore Tennis Club in neighbouring <a href="Richmond%20Hill%2C%20Ontario">Richmond Hill, Ontario</a>. Curtis was at first reluctant to take on Raonic, but was convinced after Raonic demonstrated his commitment by working with his father and a daily for two months. Years later, Raonic said he chose tennis because of its "individuality and [because he] felt [he] could train more alone and on a ball machine with [his] dad".

Raonic and Curtis worked together "twice a day, almost every day, for the next nine years." Provided that he complete his courses, Raonic was allowed to reduce his hours of attendance at Thornhill Elementary School so that he could practice more, which he did both before and after school. His parents and siblings supported his tennis, taking turns driving him to practice and tournaments, but did not push him to it or interfere with coaching. Rather, they emphasized school throughout, insisting that he maintain academic excellence as a prerequisite to playing tennis. He attended <a href="Thornhill%20Secondary%20School">Thornhill Secondary School</a>, and accelerated his course load—achieving an 82 percent average—so that he could graduate a year early. Late in 2007, at the age of 16, Raonic moved to Montreal as one of the first group of players at <a href="Tennis%20Canada">Tennis Canada</a>'s new <a href="National%20Tennis%20Centre%20%28Canada%29">National Tennis Centre</a>, thus marking the end of his formal relationship with Curtis.

Raonic's four favourite sports teams are <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>, the <a href="Toronto%20Blue%20Jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a>, the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>, and the <a href="Toronto%20Raptors">Toronto Raptors</a>. He played in the <a href="NBA%20All-Star%20Celebrity%20Game%232016%20NBA%20Celebrity%20All-Star%20Game">2016 NBA All-Star Celebrity Game</a> held in Toronto.

He worked for <a href="Rogers%20Sportsnet">Rogers Sportsnet</a> as an analyst while recovering from injury for their broadcast of the <a href="2011%20Rogers%20Cup">2011 Canadian Open</a>. In November 2011, Raonic won an exhibition match against his childhood idol, <a href="Pete%20Sampras">Pete Sampras</a>, which was dubbed "The Face Off." In 2012, he took up residence in <a href="Monte%20Carlo">Monte Carlo</a>, <a href="Monaco">Monaco</a> in a 50metre (538sqft) apartment, located minutes away from the <a href="Monte%20Carlo%20Country%20Club">Monte Carlo Country Club</a>—his "home" tennis club and the site of the <a href="Monte-Carlo%20Masters">Monte-Carlo Masters</a> tournament—and <a href="Stade%20Louis%20II">Stade Louis II</a>, which he uses for off-court training. Raonic was in a relationship with Canadian model Danielle Knudson.

In 2011, while recovering from a hip injury sustained at Wimbledon, Raonic decided to become involved with philanthropic work, focusing on helping disadvantaged children. The following year, in 2012, Raonic launched the Milos Raonic Foundation, which aims to "support children from disadvantaged backgrounds in order to remove economic, physical and other barriers that might prevent them from becoming healthy, productive members of society. ... In the initial stages of its work, the foundation will focus, in particular, on children with physical disabilities." As of 2016, the foundation had awarded $120,000 in grants to the <a href="Holland%20Bloorview%20Kids%20Rehabilitation%20Hospital">Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital</a>, and $30,000 to the <a href="Canadian%20Paralympic%20Committee">Canadian Paralympic Committee</a>. Raonic and his parents are the three directors of the foundation, which has partnered with ATP Aces for Charity.

Several celebrity fundraising events have been held in conjunction with the foundation. On November 15, 2012, the inaugural "Raonic Race for Kids" was held, with multiple teams competing in quick physical and intellectual challenges. Teams were led by celebrities, including <a href="Canadian%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Canadian Football Hall of Fame</a> quarterback <a href="Damon%20Allen">Damon Allen</a> and tennis players <a href="Eugenie%20Bouchard">Eugenie Bouchard</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Nestor">Daniel Nestor</a>. The next night, a second "Face Off" event featured exhibition matches between Raonic and <a href="Andy%20Roddick">Andy Roddick</a>, and between <a href="Serena%20Williams">Serena Williams</a> and <a href="Agnieszka%20Radwa%C5%84ska">Agnieszka Radwańska</a>. In November 2013, the second "Raonic Race for Kids" featured <a href="Davis%20Cup">Davis Cup</a> captain <a href="Martin%20Laurendeau">Martin Laurendeau</a>, musician <a href="Jim%20Cuddy">Jim Cuddy</a>, and broadcaster <a href="George%20Stroumboulopoulos">George Stroumboulopoulos</a>. The third "Raonic Race for Kids" in November 2014 featured Tennis Canada CEO <a href="Kelly%20Murumets">Kelly Murumets</a>, soccer player <a href="Dwayne%20De%20Rosario">Dwayne De Rosario</a>, and figure-skating champions <a href="Patrick%20Chan">Patrick Chan</a>, <a href="Tessa%20Virtue">Tessa Virtue</a>, and <a href="Scott%20Moir">Scott Moir</a>.

Raonic first competed at a <a href="Junior%20tennis">junior event</a> sanctioned by the <a href="International%20Tennis%20Federation">International Tennis Federation</a> (ITF) in October 2003 at the age of 12. Two years later, in October 2005, he picked up his first singles match victory at age 14. His first juniors titles in both singles and doubles came at the same <a href="Junior%20tennis%23Tournament%20grades">Grade 4 tournament</a> in October 2006. Later that year, he won the Prince Cup doubles title, partnering fellow Canadian <a href="Vasek%20Pospisil">Vasek Pospisil</a> for the first time at an ITF event. Pospisil and Raonic partnered at four more junior tournaments, including the <a href="2008%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Boys%27%20Doubles">2008 Wimbledon Championships</a> and the <a href="2008%20French%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Boys%27%20Doubles">2008 French Open</a>, reaching the semifinals in the latter. His most notable titles as a junior were in doubles, winning two Grade 1 events in 2008 partnered with <a href="Bradley%20Klahn">Bradley Klahn</a>.

Over five years, Raonic compiled a 53–30 win–loss record in singles, and a 56–24 record in doubles on the <a href="ITF%20Junior%20Circuit">ITF Junior Circuit</a>. Except for reaching the semifinals at the 2008 French Open in doubles, Raonic did not advance past the second round of junior Grand Slam events. His career-high <a href="Junior%20tennis%23Rankings">combined junior ranking</a>, which considers both singles and doubles results, was No. 35.

While an amateur, Raonic played in fourteen <a href="professional">professional</a> tournaments against adults in North America: ten <a href="ITF%20Futures">ITF Futures</a> events at the bottom tier of professional tennis; three <a href="ATP%20Challenger%20Tour">ATP Challenger Tour</a> events at the middle tier; and one <a href="ATP%20World%20Tour">ATP World Tour</a> event at the top tier. He played his first professional circuit match in the qualifying draw of an ITF Futures tournament in Toronto in October 2005 at the age of 14; he won his first professional circuit main draw match at an ITF Futures tournament in Gatineau, Quebec, in March 2007 against <a href="Fabrice%20Martin">Fabrice Martin</a>. With the win, Raonic earned his first world ranking of No. 1518. He played his first professional circuit doubles match at the same tournament, partnered with Pospisil again. Raonic lost his first ATP Challenger Tour match in Granby, Quebec, in July 2007 against <a href="Gary%20Lugassy">Gary Lugassy</a>. Raonic won his first ITF Futures doubles title in Gatineau, Quebec in March 2008, and reached his first ITF Futures singles final two weeks later in Sherbrooke, Quebec. He received a wildcard to the qualifying tournament of the <a href="2008%20Rogers%20Cup">2008 Canadian Open</a>, but lost in the first round to <a href="Alexander%20Kudryavtsev">Alexander Kudryavtsev</a>. The match was his first in the ATP World Tour.

By the summer of 2008, Raonic had received scholarship offers from several colleges, including the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton</a>, and <a href="Northwestern%20University">Northwestern University</a>, and committed to play for the <a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a> that fall while studying <a href="finance">finance</a>. Just two weeks before school started, he consulted his parents about his plan to turn professional instead. Raonic and his parents agreed that he would take correspondence courses in finance from <a href="Athabasca%20University">Athabasca University</a> while starting a professional tennis career, setting a deadline of two years for reaching the top100. During that summer, his world ranking ranged between No. 915 and No. 937. Raonic reached the top100 in January 2011, around five months later than the target deadline. He thus turned down the scholarships and turned professional, agreeing to be represented by the <a href="Sports%20agent">sports agency</a> SFX. University of Virginia men's tennis coach <a href="Brian%20Boland%20%28tennis%29">Brian Boland</a> later commented that "I have only seen two guys turn down scholarships and then succeed quickly on the Tour: <a href="Sam%20Querrey">Sam Querrey</a> and Milos Raonic."

After turning professional in September 2008 until the end of 2010, Raonic played both singles and doubles, primarily at ITF Futures and ATP Challenger tournaments. He won his first ITF Futures singles title in March 2009 in Montreal. He added three more singles titles and five doubles titles at the ITF Futures level in 2009 and 2010. He was less successful at the ATP Challenger level, tallying only one title. In his fourth tournament after turning professional, Raonic won the doubles title at the <a href="Men%27s%20Rimouski%20Challenger">Men's Rimouski Challenger</a> in November 2008, partnered with Pospisil.

At the ATP World Tour level, Raonic gained entry into few tournaments, compiling a main draw record of three wins and five losses over nearly two and half years. In 2009, Raonic again received a wildcard for the qualifying tournament of the <a href="2009%20Rogers%20Masters%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Canadian Open</a>. This time, he beat No. 77 <a href="Teymuraz%20Gabashvili">Teymuraz Gabashvili</a> and No. 113 <a href="Micha%C3%ABl%20Llodra">Michaël Llodra</a> to qualify for the main draw of an ATP World Tour tournament for the first time. In the first round, he held a <a href="Glossary%20of%20tennis%20terms%23match%20point">match point</a>, but lost to No. 10 <a href="Fernando%20Gonz%C3%A1lez">Fernando González</a> in three sets. The matches against Gabashvili and González were the first singles matches for Raonic against a top100 player and top10 player, respectively.

A year later, at the <a href="2010%20Rogers%20Cup%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Doubles">2010 Canadian Open</a>, Raonic and Pospisil were given a doubles wildcard to the main draw, marking Raonic's first ever ATP World Tour doubles match. They won their first round match against <a href="Rafael%20Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a> and <a href="Novak%20Djokovic">Novak Djokovic</a>. It was first time that the world Nos. 1 and 2 had played together in a tour doubles match since <a href="Jimmy%20Connors">Jimmy Connors</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Ashe">Arthur Ashe</a> did so in 1976. In the second round, Raonic and Pospisil lost to reigning <a href="2010%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Doubles">Wimbledon doubles</a> champions <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Melzer">Jürgen Melzer</a> and <a href="Philipp%20Petzschner">Philipp Petzschner</a>. After the match, Raonic said: "Our goal here is pretty much as ambassadors to Canada. The more players that we can get to come, the more people we can get going to take tennis lessons."

Less than a month later, Raonic gained entry into a <a href="Grand%20Slam%20%28tennis%29">Grand Slam</a> tournament for the first time at the <a href="2010%20US%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">2010 US Open</a>. He <a href="2010%20US%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles%20Qualifying%23Eighth%20Qualifier">qualified</a> for the main draw, but lost in the first round to <a href="Carsten%20Ball">Carsten Ball</a>. Raonic's first ATP main draw singles victory came in September 2010 at the <a href="2010%20Proton%20Malaysian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Malaysian Open</a> against No. 105 <a href="Igor%20Kunitsyn">Igor Kunitsyn</a>. He followed this with a second round victory over No. 31 <a href="Sergiy%20Stakhovsky">Sergiy Stakhovsky</a>. The following week, Raonic lost in the second round of the <a href="2010%20Rakuten%20Japan%20Open%20Tennis%20Championships">2010 Japan Open</a> to No. 1 Nadal. This marked his first singles match against a player ranked No. 1, and his first singles match against a member of the <a href="Big%20Four%20%28tennis%29">Big Four</a>—a quartet of dominant tennis players including Nadal, Djokovic, <a href="Roger%20Federer">Roger Federer</a>, and <a href="Andy%20Murray">Andy Murray</a>.
Raonic's coaching relationship evolved during his early professional years. Since late 2007, Raonic had been working with Tennis Canada coaches—including <a href="Guillaume%20Marx">Guillaume Marx</a>, Head Boys National Coach—based out of the National Training Centre at <a href="Jarry%20Park">Jarry Park</a> in Montreal. In November 2009, with Raonic's world ranking at No. 377, Tennis Canada hired recently retired former player <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Niemeyer">Frédéric Niemeyer</a> to coach Raonic and travel with him for 18 weeks during the 2010 season. Toward the end of 2010, however, Niemeyer decided to travel less owing to "family considerations." As a result, Tennis Canada arranged for a two-week trial period with former No. 40 <a href="Galo%20Blanco">Galo Blanco</a> in co-operation with Niemeyer, including tournaments in Malaysia and Japan in late September and early October. Over this period, Raonic climbed from No. 237 to No. 155. Tennis Canada hired Blanco, and Raonic moved to <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> to train with Blanco and trainer Tony Estalella. Commenting on the training regiment, Blanco said "the off-season Milos had this winter in Barcelona was amazing. We never saw anything like that before, working the way he worked for six weeks."

The first two months of 2011 represented a significant breakthrough for Raonic, as he rose from No. 156 at the beginning of January to No. 37 by the end of February. In doing so, he became the highest-ranked Canadian male ever. He began this climb by <a href="2011%20Australian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles%20Qualifying%23Sixteenth%20Qualifier">qualifying</a> for the <a href="2011%20Australian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Australian Open</a> main draw. His first round victory over <a href="Bj%C3%B6rn%20Phau">Björn Phau</a> marked his first victory in a main draw Grand Slam match. In the second round, he defeated No. 22 seed Llodra, becoming the first Canadian man in 10 years to reach the third round of a Grand Slam singles tournament. With his career-first victory over a top10 player (<a href="Mikhail%20Youzhny">Mikhail Youzhny</a>) in the third round, he became the first qualifier to make the fourth round of a major since <a href="Marcelo%20Filippini">Marcelo Filippini</a> at the <a href="1999%20French%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">1999 French Open</a>.

Despite losing in the fourth round to No. 7 <a href="David%20Ferrer">David Ferrer</a>, Raonic received rave reviews for his Australian Open performance. <a href="Patrick%20McEnroe">Patrick McEnroe</a> said "Raonic [is] the real deal". <a href="BBC%20Sport">BBC Sport</a> referred to Raonic as part of "a new generation". <a href="Martina%20Navratilova">Martina Navratilova</a> referred to Raonic as "a new star" saying that "the sky is the limit". "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" referred to Raonic as a "future superstar".

Two weeks later, Raonic won his first ATP title at the <a href="2011%20SAP%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Pacific Coast Championships</a>, with victories over No. 45 <a href="Xavier%20Malisse">Xavier Malisse</a>, No. 170 <a href="James%20Blake%20%28tennis%29">James Blake</a>, No. 74 <a href="Ri%C4%8Dardas%20Berankis">Ričardas Berankis</a>, and No. 9 <a href="Fernando%20Verdasco">Fernando Verdasco</a>. With the victory, he became the first player born in the 1990s to win an ATP title, and the youngest winner since <a href="Marin%20%C4%8Cili%C4%87">Marin Čilić</a> won the <a href="2008%20Pilot%20Pen%20Tennis%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">2008 Connecticut Open</a> at age 19. Raonic's victory was the first ATP title by a Canadian since <a href="Greg%20Rusedski">Greg Rusedski</a> in 1995.

The following week, Raonic reached the final of an <a href="ATP%20World%20Tour%20500%20series">ATP 500</a> tournament for the first time at the <a href="2011%20Regions%20Morgan%20Keegan%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships</a>. He defeated Verdasco for the second time in three days in the first round, and No. 17 <a href="Mardy%20Fish">Mardy Fish</a> in the semifinal. In the final, he lost in three sets to No. 8 Roddick, with Roddick making a diving forehand to break serve for the match on his fifth championship point. Roddick stated: "That's the best shot I've ever hit in my life, considering the circumstance."

With his improved ranking (No. 37), Raonic earned direct entry to Grand Slam tournaments and other ATP World Tour events for the first time. He reached the third round at both the <a href="2011%20BNP%20Paribas%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Indian Wells Masters</a> and the <a href="2011%20Monte-Carlo%20Rolex%20Masters%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Monte-Carlo Masters</a>. In May, Raonic rose to a new career-high ranking of No. 25. He was seeded for the first time at a Grand Slam event at the <a href="2011%20French%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">French Open</a>, but lost in the first round to <a href="Michael%20Berrer">Michael Berrer</a>. At the <a href="2011%20Gerry%20Weber%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Doubles">Halle Open</a>, Raonic reached his first ATP World Tour doubles final, partnered with <a href="Robin%20Haase">Robin Haase</a>. The pair lost to <a href="Rohan%20Bopanna">Rohan Bopanna</a> and <a href="Aisam-ul-Haq%20Qureshi">Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi</a> in the deciding <a href="super%20tiebreak">super tiebreak</a>. During his second round singles match at <a href="2011%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Wimbledon</a> against <a href="Gilles%20M%C3%BCller">Gilles Müller</a>, Raonic retired with an early lead after injuring his right hip when he slipped and fell on the grass. He underwent hip surgery which prevented him from competing until September. His only significant result in the latter half of 2011 after returning from injury was a semifinal appearance at the <a href="2011%20If%20Stockholm%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Stockholm Open</a>, where he lost to <a href="Ga%C3%ABl%20Monfils">Gaël Monfils</a>.

Raonic began 2012 with titles in two of his first three tournaments, starting with his second ATP title at the <a href="2012%20Aircel%20Chennai%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Chennai Open</a> in India. He had back-to-back wins over top10 players at a tournament for the first time, beating <a href="Nicol%C3%A1s%20Almagro">Nicolás Almagro</a> in the semifinals and <a href="Janko%20Tipsarevi%C4%87">Janko Tipsarević</a> in the final. Raonic <a href="Glossary%20of%20tennis%20terms%23hold">held serve</a> during the entire tournament, becoming the first player to do so since Federer at the <a href="2008%20Gerry%20Weber%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">2008 Halle Open</a>. He lost in the third round of the <a href="2012%20Australian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Australian Open</a> to <a href="Lleyton%20Hewitt">Lleyton Hewitt</a>. In February, Raonic defended his title at the <a href="2012%20SAP%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Pacific Coast Championships</a>, defeating <a href="Denis%20Istomin">Denis Istomin</a> in the final for his third ATP title. The following week in Memphis, Raonic reached the final of the <a href="2012%20Regions%20Morgan%20Keegan%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships</a> for the second straight year, but lost to Melzer.

In the spring, Raonic played his first three matches against No. 3 Federer on three different surfaces: hard court in the third round of the <a href="2012%20BNP%20Paribas%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Indian Wells Masters</a>; clay in the second round at the <a href="2012%20Mutua%20Madrid%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Madrid Open</a>; and grass in the quarterfinals at the <a href="2012%20Gerry%20Weber%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Halle Open</a>. On each occasion, Raonic won the first set before losing the next two. After the Halle Open match, Federer remarked: "I am happy to have beaten him now because by the end of my career, he’ll be serving at 300km/h." He defeated No. 4 Murray in straight sets in the quarterfinals at the <a href="2012%20Barcelona%20Open%20Banco%20Sabadell%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Barcelona Open</a>. This marked his first victory over a member of the Big Four. In the semifinal, he lost to No. 6 Ferrer. Raonic lost to <a href="Juan%20M%C3%B3naco">Juan Mónaco</a> in the third round of the <a href="2012%20French%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">French Open</a>, and followed this with a second round loss to Querrey at <a href="2012%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Wimbledon</a>.

Raonic reached his first <a href="ATP%20World%20Tour%20Masters%201000">ATP 1000</a> quarterfinals at back-to-back events in August, losing to <a href="John%20Isner">John Isner</a> at the <a href="2012%20Rogers%20Cup%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Canadian Open</a> and <a href="Stan%20Wawrinka">Stan Wawrinka</a> at the <a href="2012%20Western%20%26amp%3B%20Southern%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Cincinnati Masters</a>. His loss to Wawrinka followed his victory over No. 7 <a href="Tom%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Berdych">Tomáš Berdych</a>, his fourth top10 victory of the year. On August 13, his world ranking was No. 19, marking his first time in the top20. At the <a href="2012%20US%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">US Open</a>, Raonic lost in the fourth round to eventual champion Murray. Raonic was the first Canadian male to reach the fourth round of the US Open since Laurendeau in 1988. In October at the <a href="2012%20Rakuten%20Japan%20Open%20Tennis%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Japan Open</a>, Raonic reached his third ATP 500 final, defeating <a href="Radek%20%C5%A0t%C4%9Bp%C3%A1nek">Radek Štěpánek</a>, <a href="Viktor%20Troicki">Viktor Troicki</a>, Tipsarević, and Murray, before dropping the final to Japan's <a href="Kei%20Nishikori">Kei Nishikori</a> in three sets. His victories over Tipsarević and Murray marked the third time he won back-to-back matches against top10 players.

In 2012, Raonic led the ATP in points won on 1st serve (82%) and in service games won (93%). He finished the year at a career high singles ranking of No. 13. His six victories over top10 players in 2012, including two over Murray, marks a career-high.

In all four 2013 Grand Slam tournaments, Raonic matched his previous best result. He reached the fourth round of the <a href="2013%20Australian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Australian Open</a>, falling to No. 2 Federer. At the <a href="2013%20French%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">French Open</a>, he lost in the third round to <a href="Kevin%20Anderson%20%28tennis%29">Kevin Anderson</a>. At <a href="2013%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Wimbledon</a>, he lost in the second round to <a href="Igor%20Sijsling">Igor Sijsling</a>. At the <a href="2013%20US%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">US Open</a>, he fell to No. 9 <a href="Richard%20Gasquet">Richard Gasquet</a> in the fourth round, despite a career-high 39 aces.

Raonic again achieved success at <a href="ATP%20World%20Tour%20250%20series">ATP 250</a> and ATP 500 events. In February, Raonic earned his third consecutive title at the <a href="2013%20SAP%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Pacific Coast Championships</a>, defeating <a href="Tommy%20Haas">Tommy Haas</a> in the final. Over three years, he achieved a perfect 12–0 match record, and did not drop a single set. He is the only man in the Open Era to win three consecutive singles titles at this event. In September, he won the <a href="2013%20PTT%20Thailand%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Thailand Open</a> tournament, defeating No. 9 Gasquet in the semifinals and No. 6 Berdych in the final. The titles were Raonic's fourth and fifth, both coming in ATP 250 events like previous titles. In October, Raonic reached the <a href="2013%20Rakuten%20Japan%20Open%20Tennis%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Japan Open</a> final for the second consecutive year, but lost a close match to No. 7 <a href="Juan%20Mart%C3%ADn%20del%20Potro">Juan Martin del Potro</a>. It marked his fourth consecutive loss in the final of an ATP 500 event.

In eight of the nine ATP 1000 events, Raonic matched or improved on his career-best performance. This included his first ATP 1000 series final at the <a href="2013%20Rogers%20Cup%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Canadian Open</a> in August. During his third round victory over del Potro, Raonic was awarded a point even though his foot touched the net. He did not report his error to the umpire, and won the last nine points to close out the match. Raonic later admitted that he was wrong not to admit his error at the time: "I made a mistake in the spur of the moment ... I'm disappointed with myself, how I dealt with it." After beating <a href="Ernests%20Gulbis">Ernests Gulbis</a> in the quarterfinals, Raonic defeated compatriot Pospisil in the semifinals. The match against Pospisil was the first all-Canadian semifinal in an ATP 1000 tournament. In the final, he lost to Nadal in just 68 minutes. Following the tournament, Raonic was ranked No. 10, becoming the first Canadian player and the first player born in the 1990s to break into the top10.

In 2013, Raonic again led the ATP in points won on first serve (82%) and in service games won (91%). He had 45 match victories for the second consecutive year. His coaching team underwent significant changes in 2013. In May, Raonic split with his coach of two and half years, Blanco. Less than a month later, Raonic hired former No. 3 tennis player <a href="Ivan%20Ljubi%C4%8Di%C4%87">Ivan Ljubičić</a> as his coach. In December, he hired <a href="Riccardo%20Piatti">Riccardo Piatti</a> as a co-coach with Ljubičić.

Raonic opened 2014 by reaching the third round of the <a href="2014%20Australian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Australian Open</a>, losing to <a href="Grigor%20Dimitrov">Grigor Dimitrov</a>. He sustained an ankle injury that kept him out of action for six weeks.

From March through May, Raonic improved on his career-best performance at five consecutive ATP 1000 events. At the <a href="2014%20BNP%20Paribas%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Indian Wells Masters</a>, he beat No. 6 Murray to reach the quarterfinals, losing to <a href="Alexandr%20Dolgopolov">Alexandr Dolgopolov</a>. He lost in the quarterfinals of the <a href="2014%20Sony%20Open%20Tennis%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Miami Masters</a> to Nadal. He reached the quarterfinals for the third ATP 1000 tournament in a row at the <a href="2014%20Monte-Carlo%20Rolex%20Masters%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Monte-Carlo Masters</a>, before falling to Wawrinka. The result garnered Raonic a career-high ranking as world No. 9. Raonic lost in the third round of the <a href="2014%20Mutua%20Madrid%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Madrid Open</a> to Nishikori. At the <a href="2014%20Internazionali%20BNL%20d%27Italia%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Italian Open</a>, Raonic defeated <a href="J%C3%A9r%C3%A9my%20Chardy">Jérémy Chardy</a> in the quarterfinals to reach his first Masters 1000 semifinal on clay. After winning the first set, he lost his semifinal match to eventual champion Djokovic. Although he had played Djokovic in the 2013 Davis Cup, this was their first ATP match against one another.

At the <a href="2014%20French%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">French Open</a>, Raonic was seeded in the top eight for the first time at a Grand Slam tournament. He notched victories against <a href="Nick%20Kyrgios">Nick Kyrgios</a>, <a href="Ji%C5%99%C3%AD%20Vesel%C3%BD">Jiří Veselý</a>, <a href="Gilles%20Simon">Gilles Simon</a>, and <a href="Marcel%20Granollers">Marcel Granollers</a> to reach the quarterfinals of a major for the first time in his career, becoming the first Canadian man to do so in the <a href="History%20of%20tennis%23Open%20Era">Open Era</a>. He lost in the quarterfinals to Djokovic in straight sets. After the match, Raonic commented: "I've gone farther in a Slam than I have before and I've learned things even from this loss."

At <a href="2014%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Wimbledon</a>, Raonic was again seeded eighth. He defeated <a href="Matthew%20Ebden">Matthew Ebden</a>, <a href="Jack%20Sock">Jack Sock</a>, <a href="%C5%81ukasz%20Kubot">Łukasz Kubot</a>, Nishikori, and Kyrgios to reach his first major semifinal. He became the first Canadian men's singles player to reach the semifinals at a major since <a href="Robert%20Powell%20%28tennis%29">Robert Powell</a> in 1908. In the quarterfinal victory against Kyrgios, Raonic tied a career-high with 39 aces. In the semifinals, Raonic lost to Federer in straight sets. After the match, Raonic reflected: "There's a lot of good things to take from it. ... But when you get here to this point, I think it's just human nature, the greed of human nature, that you want so much more. You feel it in front of you and you want to grab it." Despite the loss, Raonic saw his world ranking improve to a career-high No. 6.

In his next tournament, Raonic reached his first final of the year at the <a href="2014%20Citi%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Washington Open</a>, facing Pospisil in the first all-Canadian final in ATP history. Raonic won the title in straight sets. It was his first ATP 500 title, after finishing as runner-up in four previous ATP 500 tournaments. After reaching the quarterfinals at the <a href="2014%20Rogers%20Cup%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Canadian Open</a> and the semifinals at the <a href="2014%20Western%20%26amp%3B%20Southern%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Cincinnati Masters</a>, he claimed the men's <a href="2014%20US%20Open%20Series">2014 US Open Series</a>.

At the <a href="2014%20US%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">US Open</a>, Raonic was seeded fifth. He won his first three matches to face rival Nishikori in the fourth round. On the morning of September 2, Raonic and Nishikori tied the all-time latest finish for a match at the <a href="US%20Open%20%28tennis%29">US Open</a>, ending at 2:26 a.m. This tied previous matches between <a href="Mats%20Wilander">Mats Wilander</a> and <a href="Mikael%20Pernfors">Mikael Pernfors</a> in 1993, and between Isner and <a href="Philipp%20Kohlschreiber">Philipp Kohlschreiber</a> in 2012. The five set match lasted 4 hours and 19 minutes, with Raonic losing and Nishikori advancing to the quarterfinals. In October, Raonic reached the final of the <a href="2014%20Rakuten%20Japan%20Open%20Tennis%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Japan Open</a> for the third consecutive year, but lost to Nishikori again.

Three years prior, in 2011, Raonic had set a personal goal of reaching the year-end <a href="ATP%20World%20Tour%20Finals">ATP Finals</a>, where only the top eight players earned a spot. Heading into the last ATP 1000 event of 2014, the <a href="2014%20BNP%20Paribas%20Masters%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Paris Masters</a>, Raonic trailed Ferrer for the eighth spot, and needed a deep run to surpass him. He beat Sock and <a href="Roberto%20Bautista%20Agut">Roberto Bautista Agut</a> to set up a quarterfinals match against No. 2 Federer, who had beaten him in all six previous meetings. Needing a win to avoid being eliminated from contention for the ATP Finals, Raonic won in straight sets. His victory was hailed as "a career-defining win." In the post-match interview, Raonic was asked to rank this victory in his career. He replied: "Considering all the circumstances around it, I think this was the biggest win for me." He went on to beat No. 5 Berdych in the semifinals to earn a spot in the second ATP 1000 final of his career. He lost to Djokovic in the final, but secured his place in the <a href="2014%20ATP%20World%20Tour%20Finals">2014 ATP Finals</a>. He is the first Canadian to reach the ATP Finals, and the first player born in the 1990s to do so. Anticlimactically, Raonic withdrew from the tournament due to a leg-muscle tear prior to his match against Nishikori, after losses to Federer and Murray.

Raonic ended the year at a career-high season-ending ranking of No. 8. He was one of just three players to reach the quarterfinals or better at seven of the nine ATP 1000 tournaments. Raonic finished with a career-high total of 1107 aces in 2014. At the time, this was the fifth highest single-year ace total in history. (It was surpassed by both <a href="Ivo%20Karlovi%C4%87">Ivo Karlović</a> and Isner in 2015.)

Raonic began 2015 by reaching the final at the <a href="2015%20Brisbane%20International%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Brisbane International</a> after defeating No. 5 Nishikori in three sets, all decided in <a href="tiebreak%20%28tennis%29">tiebreak</a>s. He lost to No. 2 Federer in three sets, with Federer recording his 1,000th match win on the professional tour. Later in the month, he reached the quarterfinals of the <a href="2015%20Australian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Australian Open</a> after beating No. 12 <a href="Feliciano%20L%C3%B3pez">Feliciano López</a>. He lost to Djokovic in straight sets.

At the <a href="2015%20BNP%20Paribas%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Indian Wells Masters</a>, Raonic won his quarterfinal match against No. 3 Nadal, after saving three match points from Nadal in the second set tiebreak. It was Raonic's first career victory over Nadal after five defeats. He lost to Federer in the semifinals.

In April, Raonic opened the <a href="2015%20Monte-Carlo%20Rolex%20Masters%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Monte-Carlo Masters</a> with a victory over <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20Sousa">João Sousa</a>. Just one game into his second-round match against <a href="Tommy%20Robredo">Tommy Robredo</a>, Raonic called for a medical timeout due to a right foot injury. Although he went on to win the match, Raonic's manager indicated that Raonic had made a pre-existing injury worse by playing. In his quarterfinal match against Berdych, he complained of numbness in his right foot during a medical timeout, and retired while trailing 2–5 in the opening set. It was diagnosed as a pinched nerve, and Raonic was expected to be healthy for the <a href="2015%20Mutua%20Madrid%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Madrid Open</a>.

In Madrid, Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals with straight sets victories over Mónaco and <a href="Leonardo%20Mayer">Leonardo Mayer</a>. After Raonic lost in the quarterfinals against Murray, Murray observed that Raonic was "struggling [with injury]." Following the match, Raonic announced that he would undergo surgery to repair a nerve in his foot, targeting a return in time for the <a href="2015%20French%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">French Open</a>. Ironically, Raonic's world ranking reached a new career-high of No. 4 the following week, the highest by a Canadian man or woman.

Following surgery, Raonic withdrew from the <a href="2015%20Internazionali%20BNL%20d%27Italia%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Italian Open</a> and the French Open. He returned in time for the grass court season. Having played in Halle in previous years, Raonic elected to play at the <a href="2015%20Aegon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Queen's Club Championships</a> for the first time. Raonic lost in the quarterfinals in his Queen's debut, and lost in the third round at <a href="2015%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Wimbledon</a>. After his Wimbledon loss to Kyrgios, Raonic commented that his foot injury had led to problems throughout his body: "There wasn't a place it wasn't [bothering me]... First ankle, then the hip, and then the back. Then when those things aren't working, you just put too much pressure on your shoulder, and then your shoulder hurts." The cascading injuries led to a withdrawal from <a href="Canada%20Davis%20Cup%20team">Canada</a>'s <a href="Davis%20Cup">Davis Cup</a> <a href="tie%20%28tennis%29">tie</a> against <a href="Belgium%20Davis%20Cup%20team">Belgium</a>; a withdrawal from the <a href="2015%20Citi%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Washington Open</a>, where Raonic was the defending champion; first round losses at the <a href="2015%20Rogers%20Cup%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Canadian Open</a> and <a href="2015%20Western%20%26amp%3B%20Southern%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Cincinnati Masters</a>; and a third round loss at the <a href="2015%20US%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">US Open</a> to López.

In September, at the <a href="2015%20St.%20Petersburg%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">St. Petersburg Open</a>, Raonic won his seventh singles title—and first in Europe—with a three-set victory over Sousa. His serve was broken just once in the entire tournament. After early losses at the <a href="2015%20China%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">China Open</a> and <a href="2015%20Shanghai%20Rolex%20Masters%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Shanghai Masters</a>, Raonic ended his ATP season by withdrawing from three consecutive tournaments, citing injury. On November 2, he fell outside the top10, dropping to No. 14. After six weeks off, Raonic joined the <a href="Philippine%20Mavericks">Philippine Mavericks</a> of the exhibition <a href="2015%20International%20Premier%20Tennis%20League%20season">International Premier Tennis League</a> (IPTL) in December. After four matches, he withdrew due to back spasms.

In late November, Raonic parted ways with both Ljubičić, who had been his coach since June 2013, and Austin Nunn, who had been his media manager for nearly four years. Ljubičić was added to Federer's coaching team two weeks later. Raonic contacted former No. 1 tennis player <a href="Carlos%20Moy%C3%A1">Carlos Moyá</a> about a coaching relationship, and they trained together and had discussions during the IPTL events. The relationship was subsequently formalized and on January 1, 2016, Raonic announced that Moyá would join his coaching team alongside Piatti. Raonic said that he chose Moyá for three reasons: "Carlos is very laid back and positive [... and] he communicates well."

Raonic reached the final of the <a href="2016%20Brisbane%20International%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Brisbane International</a> against No. 3 Federer in a rematch of their 2015 final. This time, Raonic upset Federer in straight sets, winning his eighth career title. Asked to talk about Raonic after the match, Federer observed: "[F]or a big guy he moves well ... He's improved his fitness the last few years. Also, tactically, I think he's better now than he's ever been. He's made a conscious effort of playing close to the baseline, which before when he was working with the Spanish coaches he was way back."

In the fourth round of the <a href="2016%20Australian%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Australian Open</a>, he upset No. 4 Wawrinka in five sets, beating the 2014 champion for the first time in five meetings. He then beat Monfils in the quarterfinals to advance to the semifinals of the Australian Open for the first time in his career. He became the first Canadian man to reach the Australian Open semifinals. In the semifinals, he lost to No. 2 Murray in five sets, sustaining an <a href="Adductor%20muscles%20of%20the%20hip">adductor</a> injury while leading two sets to one. After the match, he reflected that the loss was "probably the most heartbroken [he has] felt on court."

The adductor injury kept Raonic out of competition for six weeks, during which he withdrew from the <a href="2016%20Delray%20Beach%20International%20Tennis%20Championships">Delray Beach Open</a> and the <a href="2016%20Abierto%20Mexicano%20Telcel">Mexican Open</a>, and Canada's Davis Cup clash with <a href="France%20Davis%20Cup%20team">France</a>. He returned to action at the <a href="2016%20BNP%20Paribas%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Indian Wells Masters</a>, reaching the final against No. 1 Djokovic with a string of four victories over top20 opponents: <a href="Bernard%20Tomic">Bernard Tomic</a>, Berdych, Monfils, and <a href="David%20Goffin">David Goffin</a>. In the semifinal victory over Goffin, Raonic's average second serve (112 mph) was faster than Goffin's average first serve (110 mph). Before the final, Djokovic said: "Milos is probably playing the best tennis that he has ever played. His serve was phenomenal before the start of this season, but it seems like he has improved even more, especially the second serve. He's going for it more. He's not giving you the same look." Raonic lost a lopsided straight sets match to Djokovic in the final, his third consecutive loss in an ATP 1000 final.

Raonic followed Indian Wells by reaching the quarterfinals at the next three ATP 1000 events in <a href="2016%20Miami%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Miami</a>, <a href="2016%20Monte-Carlo%20Rolex%20Masters%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Monte Carlo</a>, and <a href="2016%20Mutua%20Madrid%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Madrid</a>, eventually losing to Kyrgios, Murray, and Djokovic, respectively. On May 2, he re-entered the top10 at No. 10. Raonic continued the clay court season with a second-round loss at the <a href="2016%20Internazionali%20BNL%20d%27Italia%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Italian Open</a> to Kyrgios. At the <a href="2016%20French%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">French Open</a>, he was the eighth seed, but fell in the fourth round in straight sets to No. 55 <a href="Albert%20Ramos%20Vi%C3%B1olas">Albert Ramos Viñolas</a>. During the French Open, former No. 1 and three-time Wimbledon champion <a href="John%20McEnroe">John McEnroe</a> announced that he would join Raonic's team as a consultant for the grass court season. Commenting on McEnroe joining Moyá and Piatti on his coaching team, Raonic said: "I was sort of just looking for another set of eyes to be a bit more efficient on grass" and he said it was about "generally improving." McEnroe left Raonic's team in August.

Raonic began the grass court season by advancing to his first grass court final at the <a href="2016%20Aegon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Queen's Club Championships</a> without dropping serve in victories over Kyrgios, Veselý, Bautista Agut, and Tomic, but lost the final in three sets to Murray. At <a href="2016%20Wimbledon%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Wimbledon</a>, Raonic won his first three matches in straight sets against <a href="Pablo%20Carre%C3%B1o%20Busta">Pablo Carreño Busta</a>, <a href="Andreas%20Seppi">Andreas Seppi</a>, and Sock. In the fourth round against Goffin, Raonic came back from a two set deficit to win in five sets for the first time in his career. In ten previous best-of-five matches where he lost the first two sets, he also lost the third set. Raonic then beat Querrey in the quarterfinals and Federer in the semifinals, marking Federer's first defeat in 11 Wimbledon semifinals. With the victory, Raonic reached his first Grand Slam final, matching Greg Rusedski. In the final, he lost to Murray in straight sets, though he made the fastest serve of the tournament at .

With the transition to hard courts after Wimbledon, Raonic made the quarterfinals of the <a href="2016%20Rogers%20Cup%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Canadian Open</a>, losing to Monfils, before falling to Murray for the fifth time in 2016 in the <a href="2016%20Western%20%26amp%3B%20Southern%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">Cincinnati Masters</a> semifinal. Raonic was the fifth seed at the <a href="2016%20US%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">US Open</a>, but lost in the second round to <a href="Ryan%20Harrison%20%28tennis%29">Ryan Harrison</a>, partly due to debilitating cramps. In September, cramps were cited as the reason for Raonic to miss Canada's Davis Cup tie against <a href="Chile%20Davis%20Cup%20team">Chile</a>. Later that month, Raonic failed to defend his title at the <a href="2016%20St.%20Petersburg%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">St. Petersburg Open</a>, falling in his opening match to Youzhny. Raonic withdrew from the <a href="2016%20China%20Open%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Singles">China Open</a> prior to his semifinal match due to an ankle injury sustained in the quarterfinal. With the result, Raonic qualified for the ATP World Tour Finals for the second time. Raonic suffered another injury, a quadriceps tear, during his quarterfinal match against <a href="Jo-Wilfried%20Tsonga">Jo-Wilfried Tsonga</a> at the <a href="2016%20BNP%20Paribas%20Masters%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">Paris Masters</a> and withdrew before his scheduled semifinal against Murray.

At the <a href="2016%20ATP%20World%20Tour%20Finals%20%E2%80%93%20Singles">ATP World Tour Finals</a>, Raonic lost to Djokovic, but beat Monfils and Thiem in round robin play to qualify for his first Tour Finals semifinal. He lost the semifinal match to Murray in 3 hours and 38 minutes, the longest match on the ATP Tour in 2016 and the longest match in World Tour Finals history. Raonic rose to a career-high No. 3, finishing the year behind only Murray and Djokovic. In December, he ended his coaching relationship with Moya, and added former Wimbledon champion <a href="Richard%20Krajicek">Richard Krajicek</a> to his coaching staff alongside Piatti for the 2017 season.

At his first tournament of the season, the <a href="2017%20Brisbane%20International">Brisbane International</a>, Raonic reached the semifinals with wins over <a href="Diego%20Schwartzman">Diego Schwartzman</a> and <a href="Rafael%20Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a> in the first two rounds. He lost to <a href="Grigor%20Dimitrov">Grigor Dimitrov</a> in straight sets. At the <a href="2017%20Australian%20Open">Australian Open</a>, he won his first two matches in straight sets respectively over <a href="Dustin%20Brown%20%28tennis%29">Dustin Brown</a> and <a href="Gilles%20M%C3%BCller">Gilles Müller</a>. In the third and fourth rounds, he defeated <a href="Gilles%20Simon">Gilles Simon</a> and then <a href="Roberto%20Bautista%20Agut">Roberto Bautista Agut</a> both in four sets. Though Raonic failed to get past eventual finalist <a href="Rafael%20Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a> in the quarterfinals, this result marked the third year in a row that Milos made at least the quarterfinals at this tournament. At his next tournament in February, he reached the final in <a href="2017%20Delray%20Beach%20Open">Delray Beach</a>, giving <a href="Jack%20Sock">Jack Sock</a> a walkover in the final due to a hamstring tear in his right leg.

Returning from injury at the <a href="2017%20Miami%20Open">Miami Open</a> in March, Raonic defeated <a href="Viktor%20Troicki">Viktor Troicki</a> in his opening round but had to withdraw from his next match against qualifier <a href="Jared%20Donaldson">Jared Donaldson</a>, again with the hamstring injury. In May, Raonic advanced to his second final of the season, losing to <a href="Marin%20%C4%8Cili%C4%87">Marin Čilić</a> in <a href="2017%20Istanbul%20Open">Istanbul</a>. He lost in the fourth round of the <a href="2017%20French%20Open">French Open</a> to <a href="Pablo%20Carre%C3%B1o%20Busta">Pablo Carreño Busta</a> in a five-set marathon. At <a href="2017%20Wimbledon%20Championships">Wimbledon</a>, he made it to the quarterfinals but was defeated by <a href="Roger%20Federer">Roger Federer</a> in straight sets. After his run at Wimbledon, he only played two more tournaments, losing in the quarterfinals in <a href="2017%20Citi%20Open">Washington, D.C.</a> to <a href="Jack%20Sock">Jack Sock</a> and in the second round in <a href="2017%20Rogers%20Cup">Montreal</a> to <a href="Adrian%20Mannarino">Adrian Mannarino</a>. He then had to withdraw from various tournaments, including the <a href="2017%20US%20Open%20%28tennis%29">US Open</a>, due to injury. Raonic returned in October at the <a href="2017%20Rakuten%20Japan%20Open%20Tennis%20Championships">Japan Open</a> but had to retire in his second round match against <a href="Y%C5%ABichi%20Sugita">Yūichi Sugita</a> again with an injury. Although he reached two finals in 2017, it was the first time since 2011 that he failed to win at least one title.

After ending his 2017 season early, Raonic dropped to No. 24. He began his season at the <a href="2018%20Brisbane%20International">Brisbane International</a> as the fourth seed. He lost in the second round to <a href="Alex%20de%20Minaur">Alex de Minaur</a> in straight sets. Raonic then went on to compete at the <a href="2018%20Australian%20Open">Australian Open</a> where he lost in the opening round to <a href="Luk%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Lacko">Lukáš Lacko</a> in four sets. This was Raonic's second time overall that he lost in the first round of a Grand Slam and the first time since the <a href="2011%20French%20Open">2011 French Open</a>. This also meant that he would fall out of the top 30 for the first time since February 2011.

Raonic's next tournament was the <a href="2018%20Delray%20Beach%20Open">Delray Beach Open</a>. He easily beat <a href="Taro%20Daniel">Taro Daniel</a> in the first round but went on to lose to <a href="Steve%20Johnson%20%28tennis%29">Steve Johnson</a> in straight sets in the next round. At <a href="2018%20BNP%20Paribas%20Open">Indian Wells</a>, Raonic reached his first Masters 1000 semifinal since November 2016 in <a href="2016%20BNP%20Paribas%20Masters">Paris</a> with wins over compatriot <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Auger-Aliassime">Félix Auger-Aliassime</a>, <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20Sousa">João Sousa</a>, <a href="Marcos%20Baghdatis">Marcos Baghdatis</a> by walkover and <a href="Sam%20Querrey">Sam Querrey</a>, respectively in the first rounds. He was defeated by <a href="Juan%20Mart%C3%ADn%20del%20Potro">Juan Martín del Potro</a> in straight sets. The next week at the <a href="2018%20Miami%20Open">Miami Open</a>, Raonic advanced to the quarterfinals but lost for the second week in a row to del Potro, this time in three close sets. He did not compete at the <a href="2018%20French%20Open">French Open</a> because of a knee injury. In June at the <a href="2018%20MercedesCup">Stuttgart Open</a>, he advanced to his first final in over a year, but was defeated by world No. 2 <a href="Roger%20Federer">Roger Federer</a>.

At <a href="2018%20Wimbledon%20Championships">Wimbledon</a>, he advanced to the quarterfinals, but lost to <a href="John%20Isner">John Isner</a>.

Raonic was seeded 16th at the <a href="2019%20Australian%20Open">2019 Australian Open</a>. He defeated <a href="Nick%20Kyrgios">Nick Kyrgios</a> in the first round in straight sets, and narrowly defeated 2014 champion <a href="Stan%20Wawrinka">Stan Wawrinka</a> in four close tiebreak sets in the second round. In the third, he defeated <a href="Pierre-Hugues%20Herbert">Pierre-Hugues Herbert</a>. In the fourth round, he faced fourth seed <a href="Alexander%20Zverev">Alexander Zverev</a>. He started the match dominantly, winning 12 of the first 14 games to take a two-set lead. Zverev played a competitive third set, but Raonic ultimately won in a tiebreak. In the quarterfinals, he lost to 28th seed <a href="Lucas%20Pouille">Lucas Pouille</a> in four sets. He announced his split with coach Goran Ivanisevic, and will now be coached by French former atp player Fabrice Santoro.

Early in his career, Raonic was questioned about whether he would follow the example of Rusedski, the last prominent Canadian tennis player, who decided to represent Great Britain instead. Raonic declared that he would play for Canada.

Raonic embraced his role as Canada's top singles player, intent on growing the game in Canada. He stated in 2010: "I want to make a difference in Canada with [my career]. I feel if I were to achieve my goals it could make a great difference to the growth of tennis in Canada and help to produce more top players in the future." Before a Davis Cup tie with Japan in 2015, he said: "I'm here because I want to be here. I don't have anybody telling me I need to be here. I want to succeed at this event, and I want to succeed representing Canada."

From 2010 to 2016, <a href="Canada%20Davis%20Cup%20team">Canada</a> competed in 16 <a href="Davis%20Cup">Davis Cup</a> ties. Raonic represented Canada in 11 of those ties, missing five due to injury: <a href="Ecuador%20Davis%20Cup%20team">Ecuador</a> in <a href="2011%20Davis%20Cup">2011</a>, <a href="Japan%20Davis%20Cup%20team">Japan</a> in <a href="2014%20Davis%20Cup%20World%20Group">2014</a>, <a href="Belgium%20Davis%20Cup%20team">Belgium</a> in <a href="2015%20Davis%20Cup%20World%20Group">2015</a>, and <a href="France%20Davis%20Cup%20team">France</a> and <a href="Chile%20Davis%20Cup%20team">Chile</a> in 2016. Overall, Raonic has 16 match wins in 22 Davis Cup matches (14–5 in singles; 2–1 in doubles). He is one of the most successful players in Canadian Davis Cup history, tied for sixth in match wins overall and for third in singles match wins.

Raonic made his Davis Cup debut in Bogota against <a href="Colombia%20Davis%20Cup%20team">Colombia</a> in <a href="2010%20Davis%20Cup">2010</a> at the age of 19. Raonic lost both of his singles matches (against <a href="Santiago%20Giraldo">Santiago Giraldo</a> and <a href="Juan%20Sebasti%C3%A1n%20Cabal">Juan Sebastián Cabal</a>), but won his doubles match partnered with Nestor, who was then the top ranked doubles player in the world. His first singles match victory came in Canada's next tie against the <a href="Dominican%20Republic%20Davis%20Cup%20team">Dominican Republic</a>, when he beat <a href="V%C3%ADctor%20Estrella%20Burgos">Víctor Estrella Burgos</a> in five sets. This marked the first five set match of Raonic's career. Competing against <a href="Mexico%20Davis%20Cup%20team">Mexico</a> in <a href="2011%20Davis%20Cup%20Americas%20Zone%20Group%20I">2011</a>, Raonic won three <a href="rubber%20%28tennis%29">rubber</a>s in a tie for the first time, beating both <a href="Manuel%20S%C3%A1nchez%20%28tennis%29">Manuel Sánchez</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Garza">Daniel Garza</a> in singles and partnering with Pospisil to win in doubles as well.

In the <a href="2013%20Davis%20Cup%20World%20Group">2013 Davis Cup World Group</a> first round, Raonic won singles rubbers over Ramos-Viñolas and <a href="Guillermo%20Garc%C3%ADa-L%C3%B3pez">Guillermo García-López</a> to lead Canada over top-seeded <a href="Spain%20Davis%20Cup%20team">Spain</a>. He repeated this feat with victories over <a href="Fabio%20Fognini">Fabio Fognini</a> and Seppi to help Canada defeat <a href="Italy%20Davis%20Cup%20team">Italy</a> in the quarterfinals, sending Canada into the Davis Cup semifinals for the first time since 1913. In the semifinal against <a href="Serbia%20Davis%20Cup%20team">Serbia</a>, Raonic won his singles match over Tipsarević, but lost to No. 1 Djokovic as Canada was eliminated. The defeat marked Raonic's first singles match against Djokovic.

Raonic <a href="Canada%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Olympics%23Tennis">represented Canada</a> at the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">London 2012</a> Olympics and competed in the <a href="Tennis%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20singles">singles competition</a> as an unseeded player. He won his first-round match over Japan's <a href="Tatsuma%20Ito">Tatsuma Ito</a> in straight sets. In the second round, Raonic lost to French player Tsonga 3–6, 6–3, 23–25, breaking <a href="Longest%20tennis%20match%20records%23Summer%20Olympics">three Olympic tennis records</a>. The match holds the records for the most games played in a best-of-three sets match (66 games) and the most games played in a single set (48 games) in Olympic history. At the time, it was the longest Olympic match by time played (3 hours 57 minutes), but this record was broken three days later in the semifinal match between Federer and del Potro (4 hours 26 minutes).

Raonic decided not to play in the <a href="2016%20Summer%20Olympics">2016 Summer Olympics</a>, citing health concerns and the <a href="Zika%20virus">Zika virus</a>.

In 2014, Raonic partnered with Bouchard to represent <a href="Canada%20at%20the%20Hopman%20Cup">Canada</a> in the <a href="2014%20Hopman%20Cup">Hopman Cup</a>. Raonic won two of three singles matches, and paired with Bouchard to win two of three doubles matches. Canada finished in second place in their pool—behind top-seeded <a href="Poland%20at%20the%20Hopman%20Cup">Poland</a>—and were eliminated.

The most distinctive part of Raonic's game is his powerful and accurate <a href="Serve%20%28tennis%29">serve</a>, from which his "Missile" nickname is derived. He is frequently cited as having one of the best serves among his contemporaries, along with Karlović and Isner. Some consider Raonic's serve to be among the best of all time. Sampras, Raonic's childhood idol, describes the Canadian's serve as "bigger than big." After a match against Raonic, Djokovic commented "I can't recall the last time I was feeling so helpless returning. Even his second serve." Women's tennis player <a href="Serena%20Williams">Serena Williams</a> has said that "If she could take one thing from another player, it would be Milos Raonic's serve." Statistically, Raonic is among the strongest servers in the Open Era, winning 91% of service games to rank third all-time. Raonic has one of the <a href="Fastest%20recorded%20tennis%20serves">fastest recorded serves</a> of all time.

Aided by his serve, Raonic employs an <a href="all-court">all-court</a> style with an emphasis on short points. His <a href="groundstroke">groundstroke</a>s are both good, but his <a href="forehand">forehand</a> is stronger than his <a href="backhand">backhand</a>. Because of this, he has been known to run around his backhand and hit <a href="inside-out%20%28tennis%29">inside-out</a> forehands instead. He attempts to dictate play and is generally more aggressive than his opponent, as evidenced by usually having more <a href="winner%20%28tennis%29">winner</a>s and more <a href="unforced%20error">unforced error</a>s. To finish points quickly, Raonic occasionally approaches the net, with either a <a href="serve%20and%20volley">serve and volley</a> or <a href="chip%20and%20charge">chip and charge</a> strategy.

Raonic prefers playing on <a href="Hardcourt">hard courts</a>, where he has been more successful than on <a href="Clay%20court">clay</a> or <a href="Grass%20court">grass</a> courts. All but two of the tournaments where Raonic has reached the final have been played on hard courts, and all but three of his victories over top10 players have been on hard courts as well.

When he was twenty, the "<a href="National%20Post">National Post</a>" described Raonic as a "hothead whose on-court demeanour was holding him back." As he grew older, commentators came to see him as "stoic", "robotic", and "emotionless", with "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" referring to him as "an analytical character who questions everything he does in practice". In 2014, Raonic explained: "I'm the son of two engineers, so everything is a numbers and calculation game." In 2016, he added: "I am very systematic in how [I] need to go about things to bring out the best tennis for myself, and maybe that comes off as mechanical and robotic and those kind of things, but I don't know if I'd ever change that because I feel that's the way I get the best out of myself when it comes to my tennis."

Aspects of Raonic's game which have been criticized include his return of serve, quickness and mobility, backhand, short game, and the use of backspin or sidespin. His above-average height—196cm (6ft 5in)—is linked to his strong serve, but is said to limit his movement around the court.

Raonic endorses the <a href="Wilson%20Sporting%20Goods">Wilson</a> BLX Blade 98 18x20 <a href="Racket%20%28sports%20equipment%29%23Tennis">tennis racket</a>, and uses LUXILON M2 Pro 1.25 16L <a href="Strings%20%28tennis%29">strings</a>. In January 2013, Raonic became the first tennis player to endorse <a href="New%20Balance">New Balance</a> clothing and shoes, in a deal reported to be worth "US$1 million annually over a five-year term." Roughly two and a half years later, this deal was extended "for the length of [Raonic's] career and beyond," and stipulates that New Balance will increase its support of the Milos Raonic Foundation. The lifelong nature of this contract was described by Tennis Canada as "unique."

Since March 2014, Raonic has donned a sleeve on his right arm while playing. At first, he wore a fisherman's sleeve to cover a rash he had due to an allergic reaction to massage cream. This was replaced with an athletic compression sleeve, often colour-coordinated with his on-court apparel. The sleeve is worn for comfort, and wearing it became a habit for Raonic. The sleeve has become a distinctive part of Raonic's image, and has spawned a Twitter account. The motto "Believe in the Sleeve" has become synonymous with Raonic in the media and among Raonic's fans. Serena Williams described the sleeve as "super cool and different."

Raonic is represented by CAA Sports, a division of <a href="Creative%20Artists%20Agency">Creative Artists Agency</a>. His other sponsorship deals include <a href="Aviva">Aviva</a> (insurance), <a href="Canada%20Goose%20%28clothing%29">Canada Goose</a> (apparel), <a href="Commerce%20Court">Commerce Court</a> (real estate), <a href="Lacoste">Lacoste</a> (apparel), <a href="Rolex">Rolex</a> (watches), <a href="SAP%20SE">SAP</a> (software), and Zepp (sports metrics).

Raonic holds a combined 8–34 record against the <a href="Big%20Four%20%28tennis%29">Big Four</a>, including 0–8 against Djokovic, 2–7 against Nadal, 3–11 against Federer, and 3–9 against Murray.

Each of Raonic's deepest runs in significant tournaments (i.e. majors and ATP 1000 tournaments) has ended with a loss to a member of the Big Four: Nadal in the 2013 Canadian Open final, Federer in the 2014 Wimbledon semifinal, Djokovic in the 2014 Paris Masters final, Murray in the 2016 Australian Open semifinal, Djokovic in the 2016 Indian Wells Masters final, Murray in the 2016 Wimbledon final, and Murray in the semifinals of the 2016 ATP World Tour Finals. At majors, Raonic has a 1–8 record against the Big Four, losing the first five matches in straight sets. He has met only one of the four in Davis Cup play: he lost to Djokovic in the <a href="2013%20Davis%20Cup%20World%20Group">2013 semifinals</a>.

Raonic's most frequent opponent, either inside or outside the Big Four, is Federer (14 matches). His first victory over Federer in the 2014 Paris Masters quarterfinal was hailed as "a career-defining win." His second victory over Federer—at the 2016 Brisbane International—was his first in a final against the Big Four. A third victory over Federer—in the 2016 Wimbledon semifinal—marked Raonic's first victory at a Grand Slam tournament against the Big Four. Raonic referred to his match against Murray at the 2016 ATP World Tour Finals as "the best match [he's] ever competed in."

<a href="Kei%20Nishikori">Kei Nishikori</a> is often cited as Raonic's primary rival. The two have very different strengths; according to "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>", Raonic uses his "size and his serve", while Nishikori uses his "savvy and speed." Both are the first from their respective countries to achieve a top10 ranking, and both have a career-high ranking inside the top4. In May 2015, they were the two youngest players in the top10. Nishikori holds a 5–2 advantage in seven close matches, including two wins in the <a href="Japan%20Open%20%28tennis%29">Japan Open</a> final (2012, 2014). Of the twenty-five sets they have played, ten have required a tiebreak. Only one of their matches has been a straight sets victory. Five matches have required the maximum number of sets. One of these was a marathon US Open five-set match that equalled the record for latest finish ever at 2:26 a.m.

Nishikori and Raonic are among a group of players whom tennis pundits suggest could be the successors of the Big Four. The members of this group vary, but have included <a href="Grigor%20Dimitrov">Grigor Dimitrov</a>, <a href="Ernests%20Gulbis">Ernests Gulbis</a>, <a href="Marin%20%C4%8Cili%C4%87">Marin Čilić</a>, and <a href="Dominic%20Thiem">Dominic Thiem</a>. Raonic holds a positive record against Gulbis and Thiem, having won on all six combined occasions, but has a negative record against Čilić and Dimitrov, having lost four matches to the latter in six meetings, including one walkover.

Pospisil is more of a contemporary rather than a rival of Raonic. Owing to their similarity in age—Pospisil is six months older—and the fact that both are successful products of Tennis Canada's development programs, they have been linked as the leaders of a new generation of Canadian tennis players. They partnered in doubles frequently early in their careers, winning doubles titles together in junior and ATP Challenger events. Between 2011 and 2015, Raonic and Pospisil have been the two top-ranked Canadian men in year-end rankings. As well as four ATP Challenger and Futures matches, they have played each other in two ATP World Tour matches: Raonic beat Pospisil in the first all-Canadian semifinal at an ATP 1000 tournament, and in the first all-Canadian final in ATP history. They are frequent Davis Cup teammates, and they planned to play doubles together at the <a href="Tennis%20at%20the%202016%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20Doubles">2016 Rio Olympics</a> until Raonic withdrew.

Raonic is often compared to Isner and Karlović. The trio possess statistically dominant serves, leading the ATP in service games won and in aces per match in the period between 2012 and 2018. They have played each other infrequently, however. Raonic is 1–1 against Karlović and 1–5 against Isner. Karlović holds a 3–2 head-to-head advantage over Isner.

Battle of Bergerac

The Battle of Bergerac was fought between Anglo-Gascon and French forces at the town of <a href="Bergerac%2C%20Dordogne">Bergerac</a> in <a href="Gascony">Gascony</a>, in August 1345 during the Hundred Years' War. In early 1345 <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III of England</a> decided to launch a major attack on the French from the north, while sending smaller forces to <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> and Gascony, the latter being both economically important to the English war effort and the proximate cause of the war. The French focused on the threat to northern France, leaving comparatively small forces in the south west.

<a href="Henry%20of%20Grosmont">Henry of Grosmont</a>, Earl of Derby arrived in Gascony in August, and breaking with the previous policy of cautious advance, <a href="Gascon%20campaign%20of%201345">struck directly for the largest French concentration</a> at Bergerac. He took French forces under <a href="Bertrand%20I%20of%20L%27Isle-Jourdain">Bertrand I of l'Isle-Jourdain</a> and <a href="Henri%20de%20Montigny">Henri de Montigny</a> by surprise and defeated them. The French suffered heavy casualties and the loss of the town, a significant strategic set-back. Along with the <a href="Battle%20of%20Auberoche">Battle of Auberoche</a> later in the year, it marked a change in the military balance of power in the region. It was the first of a series of victories which would lead to Henry of Derby being called "one of the best warriors in the world" by a contemporary chronicler.

Since the <a href="Norman%20Conquest">Norman Conquest</a> of 1066, English monarchs had held titles and lands within France, the possession of which made them <a href="vassal">vassal</a>s of the kings of France. By 1337 only <a href="Gascony">Gascony</a> in south western France and <a href="Ponthieu">Ponthieu</a> in northern France were left. The Gascons preferred their relationship with a distant English king who left them alone, to one with a French king who would interfere in their affairs. Following a series of disagreements between <a href="Philip%20VI%20of%20France">Philip VI of France</a> and <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III of England</a>, on 24 May 1337 Philip's Great Council in Paris agreed that the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Aquitaine">Duchy of Aquitaine</a>, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into Philip's hands on the grounds that Edward was in breach of his obligations as a vassal. This marked the start of the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a>, which was to last one hundred and sixteen years.

During the first half of the 14th century well over 1,000 ships a year departed Gascony for England. Among their cargos were more than of wine. The duty levied by the English Crown on wine from <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>, the capital of Gascony, was more than all other customs duties combined and by far the largest source of state income. Bordeaux had a population of over 50,000, greater than London's, and Bordeaux was possibly richer. However, by this time English Gascony had become so truncated by French encroachments that it relied on imports of food, largely from England. Any interruptions to regular shipping were liable to starve Gascony and financially cripple England; the French were well aware of this. Although Gascony was the cause of the war, Edward was able to spare few resources for it, and previously when an English army had campaigned on the continent it had operated in northern France. In most campaigning seasons the Gascons had had to rely on their own resources and had been hard pressed by the French. In 1339 the French besieged Bordeaux, the capital of Gascony, even breaking into the city with a large force before they were repulsed. Typically the Gascons could field 3,000–6,000 men, the large majority <a href="infantry">infantry</a>, although up to two thirds of them would be tied down in garrisons.

The border between English and French territory in Gascony was extremely unclear, with most significant landholders owning a patchwork of widely separated estates, perhaps owing <a href="fealty">fealty</a> to a different overlord for each. Each small estate was likely to have a <a href="fortified%20tower">fortified tower</a> or <a href="keep">keep</a>, with larger estates having castles. <a href="Fortifications">Fortifications</a> were also constructed at transport <a href="choke%20point">choke point</a>s, to collect tolls and to restrict military passage, and fortified towns grew up alongside all bridges and most fords over the many rivers in the region. Military forces could support themselves by foraging so long as they moved on at relatively frequent intervals. If they wished to remain in one place for any length of time, as was necessary to besiege a castle, then access to water transport was essential for supplies of food and fodder and desirable for such items as <a href="siege%20engine">siege equipment</a>. Warfare was usually a struggle for possession of castles and other fortified points, and for the mutable loyalty of the local nobility; the region had been in a state of flux for centuries and many local lords served whichever country was stronger, regardless of national ties.

By 1345, after eight years of war, English-controlled territory mostly consisted of a coastal strip from Bordeaux to <a href="Bayonne">Bayonne</a>, with isolated strongholds further inland. The French had strong fortifications throughout what had once been English-controlled Gascony. Several directly threatened Bordeaux: <a href="Libourne">Libourne</a>, to the east allowed French armies to assemble a day's march from Bordeaux; the strongly fortified town of <a href="Blaye">Blaye</a> was situated on the north bank of the <a href="Gironde">Gironde</a> only downstream of Bordeaux and in a position to interdict its vital seaborne communications; the fortress of <a href="Langon%2C%20Gironde">Langon</a>, south of Bordeaux, blocked upstream communication along the <a href="Garonne">Garonne</a>, and facilitated the supply of any French force advancing on Bordeaux.

Edward determined early in 1345 to attack France on three fronts. The <a href="William%20de%20Bohun%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Northampton">Earl of Northampton</a> would lead a small force to <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>, a slightly larger force would proceed to Gascony under the command of the <a href="Henry%20of%20Grosmont%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lancaster">Henry, Earl of Derby</a> and the main force would accompany Edward to France or Flanders. The previous <a href="Seneschal%20of%20Gascony">Seneschal of Gascony</a>, <a href="Nicholas%20de%20la%20Beche">Nicholas de la Beche</a>, was replaced by the more senior <a href="Ralph%20de%20Stafford%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Stafford">Ralph, Earl of Stafford</a>, who sailed for Gascony in February with an advance force. Derby was appointed the King's Lieutenant in Gascony on 13 March 1345 and received a contract to raise a force of 2,000 men in England, and further troops in Gascony itself. The highly detailed contract of indenture had a term of six months from the opening of the campaign in Gascony, with an option for Edward III to extend it for a further six month on the same terms. Derby was given a high degree of autonomy, for example his strategic instructions were: "si guerre soit, et a faire le bien q'il poet" (if there is war, do the best you can).

In early 1345 the French decided to stand on the defensive in the south west. Their intelligence correctly predicted English offensives in the three theatres, but they did not have the money to raise a significant army in each. They anticipated, correctly, that the English planned to make their main effort in northern France. Thus they directed what resources they had to there, planning to assemble their main army at <a href="Arras">Arras</a> on 22 July. South western France was encouraged to rely on its own resources, but as the <a href="Truce%20of%20Malestroit">Truce of Malestroit</a>, signed in early 1343, was still in effect, the local lords were reluctant to spend money, and little was done.

Derby's force embarked at <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> at the end of May. Due to bad weather, his fleet of 151 ships was forced to shelter in <a href="Falmouth%2C%20Cornwall">Falmouth</a> for several weeks en route, finally departing on 23 July. The Gascons, primed by Stafford to expect Derby's arrival in late May and sensing the French weakness, took the field without him. The Gascons captured the large, weakly garrisoned castles of Montravel and Monbreton on the <a href="Dordogne%20%28river%29">Dordogne</a> in early June; both were taken by surprise and their seizure broke the tenuous Truce of Malestroit. Stafford made a short advance north to besiege Blaye with his advance party and perhaps 1,000 <a href="man-at-arms">men-at-arms</a> and 3,000 infantry of the Gascon lords. Having established the siege he left the Gascons to prosecute it and proceeded to Langon, south of Bordeaux, and set up a second siege. The Anglo-Gascon forces at both sieges could be readily supplied by ship. The French issued an urgent call to arms.

Meanwhile, small independent parties of Gascons raided across the region. A number of local French groups joined them, and several minor nobles threw in their lot with the Anglo-Gascons. They had several significant successes, but their main effect was to tie down most of the weak French garrisons in the region and to cause them to call for reinforcements. The few mobile French troops in the region immobilised themselves with sieges: of <a href="Casseneuil">Casseneuil</a> in the <a href="Agenais">Agenais</a>; <a href="Monchamp">Monchamp</a> near <a href="Condom%2C%20Gers">Condom</a>; and <a href="Montcuq%20%28castle%29">Montcuq</a>, a strong but strategically insignificant castle south of <a href="Bergerac%2C%20Dordogne">Bergerac</a>. Large areas were effectively undefended.

Edward III's main army sailed on 29 June. They anchored off <a href="Sluys">Sluys</a> in <a href="County%20of%20Flanders">Flanders</a> until 22 July, while Edward attended to diplomatic affairs. When they sailed, probably intending to land in Normandy, they were scattered by a storm and found their way to various English ports over the following week. After more than five weeks on board ship the men and horses had to be disembarked. There was a further week's delay while the King and <a href="Curia%20regis">his council</a> debated what to do, by which time it proved impossible to take any action with the main English army before winter. Aware of this, Philip VI despatched reinforcements to Brittany and Gascony. <a href="Peter%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bourbon">Peter, Duke of Bourbon</a> was appointed French commander in Gascony on 8 August and based himself at <a href="Agen">Agen</a>.

On 9 August 1345 Derby arrived in <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> with 500 men-at-arms, 500 mounted <a href="Longbow">archers</a> and 1,000 English and Welsh foot archers. After two weeks recruiting and organising Derby marched his force to Langon, rendezvoused with Stafford and took command of the combined force. Stafford had to this point pursued a cautious strategy of small-scale sieges. Derby's intention was quite different, rather than continue a cautious war of sieges he was determined to strike directly at the French main force before it was fully assembled. The French, hearing of Derby's arrival, concentrated their forces at the strategically important town of Bergerac, where there was an important bridge over the <a href="Dordogne%20River">Dordogne River</a>, under the command of <a href="Bertrand%20I%20of%20L%27Isle-Jourdain">Bertrand de l'Isle-Jourdain</a>. They would also be within reach of the French force under <a href="Henri%20de%20Montigny">Henri de Montigny</a>, <a href="Seneschal">Seneschal</a> of <a href="P%C3%A9rigord">Périgord</a>, besieging nearby Montcuq. After a council of war Derby decided to attack the French here. The capture of the town, which had good river supply links to Bordeaux, would provide the Anglo-Gascon army with a base from which to carry the war to the French. It would also force the lifting of the siege of the nearby allied castle of Montcuq and sever communications between French forces north and south of the Dordogne. The English believed that if the French field army could be beaten or distracted the town could be easily taken.

Sometime in mid-August Derby marched from Langon with 1,200 men-at-arms, of whom 700 were Gascons, 1,500 <a href="English%20longbow">longbowmen</a> and 2,800 Gascon infantry. The French around Bergerac and Montcuq had 1,600 men-at-arms and a large but unspecified number of other troops. Derby's army moved fast and took the French forces by surprise. The exact date of the battle is unknown; A.H. Burne gives the fall of Bergerac as 26 August but holds that the battle took place some days before, while Kenneth Fowler gives the date of the fall of Bergerac as 24 August.

Exactly where the first part of the battle took place is also unknown. The modern historian <a href="Clifford%20J.%20Rogers">Clifford Rogers</a> makes the case for the road between St. Aubin-de-Langais and St. Nexans. Fowler believes it was on the road from Montcuq to Bergerac. The French, either lured from Bergerac by a ruse or in the process of withdrawing from their siege of Montcuq, or both, were caught on the road by the Anglo-Gascon army. They were subject to a barrage of English archery and struck by a charge by the Anglo-Gascon men-at-arms. The French were routed and a running fight took place as they fled toward the St. Madeleine suburb of Bergerac, at the south end of the bridge. Because the pursuit was so close, it was impossible to close the gates on the <a href="barbican">barbican</a> at the south end of the bridge and it was overrun. The pursuers pressed on to the bridge, which was long, narrow, and obstructed half way along by a chapel. The garrison attempted to sortie to secure the barbican and the bridge became jammed with Frenchmen. English archers waded out to sandbanks in the river and <a href="Enfilade%20and%20defilade">enfiladed</a> the panic-stricken French from both flanks. They "were killed in great numbers" and many surrendered to the Anglo-Gascons pressing close behind them. Attempts to drop the <a href="portcullis">portcullis</a> on the north end of the bridge were thwarted by a wounded horse falling in the gateway. The Anglo-Gascons pressed on to attack the town itself.

At this point the contemporary sources differ. The two main chronicles covering the whole war, <a href="Froissart">Froissart</a>'s "The Chronicles of England, France and Spain" and the "St. Omer Chronicle", state that the gate was closed and that the town withstood a siege for several days, falling only after Derby had boats brought up-river to enable an attack on the weak riverside wall. A larger group of 14th century sources, including the two which focus specifically on the war in Gascony, the "Chronique de Guyenne" and the "Chronique de Brazas", state that the gate was carried by the first assault, on the same day as the battle, and after nightfall. There is other documentary evidence to support this opinion and it is generally accepted by modern historians, such as Rogers and <a href="Jonathan%20Sumption%2C%20Lord%20Sumption">Jonathan Sumption</a>. In any event, whether several days later or on the evening of the battle, the town was captured and <a href="looting">sacked</a>, and a large amount of supplies and horses was captured. The surviving French from the field army which had been besieging Montcuq were gathered by <a href="John%20I%2C%20Count%20of%20Armagnac">John, Count of Armagnac</a>, and retreated north to <a href="P%C3%A9rigueux">Périgueux</a>.

The battle and subsequent capture of Bergerac were major victories; the plunder from the defeated French army and from sacking the town was immense. Over 600 French men-at-arms were listed as killed, and a large number were captured. Losses among the French infantry are not recorded but were reported to have been heavy; as was customary, most of the common soldiers were killed, regardless of whether they were still bearing arms. Prisoners included Henri de Montingny, ten other noblemen and a large number of lesser nobles. Derby's share of the ransoms and the loot was estimated at £34,000 (£ in 2019 terms), approximately four times the annual income from his lands. English and Gascon losses were very light.

It was the first of a series of victories which would lead to Derby being called "one of the best warriors in the world" by a contemporary chronicler in "Chroniques de quatres premier Valois" and to modern historians praising his generalship as: "[a] superb and innovative tactician" (Rogers); "ris[ing] to the level of genius" (Rogers); "brilliant in the extreme" (Burne); "stunning" (Gribit). Modern historian Nicholas Gribit has described Derby's four month campaign of 1345 as "the first successful land campaign of... the Hundred Years' War".

Strategically, the Anglo-Gascon army had secured an important base for <a href="Gascon%20campaign%20of%201345">further operations</a>. Politically, local lords who had been undecided in their allegiance had been shown that the English were again a force to be reckoned with in Gascony. Along with the <a href="Battle%20of%20Auberoche">Battle of Auberoche</a> later in the year, it marked a change in the military balance of power in the region.

Portrait of a Lady (van der Weyden)

Portrait of a Lady (or Portrait of a Woman) is a small <a href="panel%20painting">oil-on-oak panel</a> painting executed around 1460 by the <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Netherlandish painter</a> <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>. The composition is built from the geometric shapes that form the lines of the woman's <a href="veil">veil</a>, neckline, face, and arms, and by the fall of the light that illuminates her face and headdress. The vivid contrasts of darkness and light enhance the almost unnatural beauty and Gothic elegance of the model.

Van der Weyden was preoccupied by commissioned <a href="portrait%20painting">portraiture</a> towards the end of his life and was highly regarded by later generations of painters for his penetrating evocations of character. In this work, the woman's humility and reserved demeanour are conveyed through her fragile physique, lowered eyes and tightly grasped fingers. She is slender and depicted according to the Gothic ideal of elongated features, indicated by her narrow shoulders, tightly pinned hair, high forehead and the elaborate frame set by the headdress. It is the only known portrait of a woman accepted as an autograph work by van der Weyden, yet the sitter's name is not recorded and he did not title the work.

Although van der Weyden did not adhere to the conventions of idealisation, he generally sought to flatter his sitters. He depicted his models in highly fashionable clothing, often with rounded—almost sculpted—facial features, some of which deviated from natural representation. He adapted his own aesthetic, and his portraits of women often bear a striking resemblance to each other.

The painting has been in the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Art">National Gallery of Art</a> in Washington, D.C. since donated in 1937, and is no. 34 in the de Vos <a href="catalogue%20raisonn%C3%A9">catalogue raisonné</a> of the artist. It has been described as "famous among all portraits of women of all schools".

The woman, who is probably in her late teens or early twenties, is shown half-length and in three-quarters profile, set against a two-dimensional interior background of deep blue-green. The background is <a href="Perspective%20%28graphical%29">flat</a> and lacks the attention to detail common in van der Weyden's devotional works. Like his contemporary <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a> (c. 1395 – 1441), when working in portraiture, he used dark planes to focus attention on the sitter. It was not until <a href="Hans%20Memling">Hans Memling</a> (c. 1435–1494), a pupil of van der Weyden, that a Netherlandish artist set a portrait against an exterior or landscape. In this work the flat setting allows the viewer to settle on the woman's face and quiet self-possession. Van der Weyden reduces his focus to four basic features: the woman's headdress, dress, face and hands. The background has darkened with age; it is likely that the angles created by the sitter's <a href="hennin">hennin</a> and dress were once much sharper.

The woman wears an elegant low-cut black dress with dark bands of fur at the neck and wrist. Her clothes are of the then-fashionable <a href="Burgundians">Burgundian</a> style, which emphasises the tall and thin aesthetic of the <a href="Gothic%20art">Gothic</a> ideal. Her dress is buckled by a bright red sash pulled in below her breasts. The <a href="Buff%20%28colour%29">buff</a>-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention to the structure of the clothing—the careful detailing of the pins pushed into the veil to fix its position—is typical for the artist.

The woman's veil forms a diamond shape, balanced by the inverse flow of a light vest worn beneath her dress. She is shown at a slight angle, but her pose is centred by the interlocked broad lines of arms, <a href="Cleavage%20%28breasts%29">décolletage</a> and veil. The woman's head is delicately lit, leaving no strong tonal contrasts on her skin. She has a long, thin face, plucked eyebrows and eyelids, and a plucked hairline to create a fashionably high forehead. Her hair is tightly pinned back on the rim of the bonnet and rests above her ear. Her high headdress and severe hairline accentuate her elongated face, giving it a sculpted appearance.

The woman's left ear is set, according to art historian Norbert Schneider, unnaturally high and far back, parallel to her eyes rather than to her nose; this position is probably an artistic device used to continue the flow of the diagonal line of the veil's inner-right wing. In the 15th century, veils were normally worn for modesty, to hide the sensuality of the flesh. In this work the veil has the opposite effect; the woman's face is framed by the headdress to draw attention to her beauty.

The woman's hands are crossed tightly as if in prayer, and positioned so low in the painting as to appear to be resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.

Her eyes gaze downward in humility, in contrast to her relatively extravagant clothes. The piety of her expression is achieved through motifs common to van der Weyden's work. Her eyes and nose are elongated and her lower lip made fuller by the use of tone and pronounced finish. Some vertical lines around these features are emphasised, while her pupils are enlarged and her eyebrows slightly raised. In addition the contours of her face are highlighted in a manner that is slightly unnatural and abstract, and outside the usual spatial constraints of 15th-century human representation. This methodology was described by art historian <a href="Erwin%20Panofsky">Erwin Panofsky</a>: "Rogier concentrated on certain salient features—salient both from a <a href="physiognomical">physiognomical</a> and psychological point of view—which he expressed primarily by lines." Her high forehead and full mouth have been seen as suggestive of a nature at once intellectual, ascetic, and passionate, symbolic of "an unresolved conflict in her personality". Panofsky refers to a "smouldering excitability".

The sitter is unknown, although some art historians have speculated on her identity. On the grounds of similarity of facial features, writer Wilhelm Stein suggested in the early 20th century that she might be Marie de Valengin, the illegitimate daughter of <a href="Philip%20the%20Good">Philip the Good of Burgundy</a>. However, this is a contentious assertion and not widely held. Because her hands are shown as resting on the painting's lower frame, art historians generally accept that this was an independent portrait, rather than a devotional work. It is possible that it was intended as a pendant to a picture of the woman's husband, however no other portrait has been suggested as a likely companion.

Van der Weyden worked in the same tradition of portraiture as contemporaries Jan van Eyck and <a href="Robert%20Campin">Robert Campin</a>. In the early to middle 15th century, these three artists were among the first generation of "<a href="Northern%20Renaissance">Northern Renaissance</a>" painters, and the first northern Europeans to portray members of the middle and upper classes naturalistically rather than in a medieval Christian idealised form. In earlier Netherlandish art the profile view was the dominant mode of representation for the nobles or clergy worthy of portraiture. In works such as "<a href="Portrait%20of%20a%20Man%20%28Self%20Portrait%3F%29">Portrait of a Man in a Turban</a>" (1433), Jan van Eyck broke this tradition and used the three-quarter profile of the face which became the standard in Netherlandish art. Here, van der Weyden utilises the same profile, which better allows him to describe the shape of the head and facial features of the sitter. She is shown in half-length, which enables the artist to show her hands crossed at her waist.

Despite this new freedom, van der Weyden's portraits of women are strikingly similar in concept and structure, both to each other and to female portraits by Campin. Most are three-quarter face and half-length. They typically set their models in front of a dark background that is uniform and nondescript. While the portraits are noted for their expressive pathos, the facial features of the women strongly resemble one another. This indicates that although van der Weyden did not adhere to the tradition of idealised representation, he sought to please his sitters in a manner that reflected contemporary ideals of beauty. Most of van der Weyden's portraits were painted as commissions from the nobility; he painted only five (including "Portrait of a Lady") that were not <a href="donor%20portrait">donor portrait</a>s. It is known that in his "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Philip%20de%20Cro%C3%BF">Portrait of Philip de Croÿ</a>" (c. 1460), van der Weyden complimented the young Flemish nobleman by concealing his large nose and undershot jaw. When describing this tendency in relation to the Washington portrait, art historian Norbert Schneider wrote, "While van Eyck shows nature 'in the raw', as it were, Rogier improves on physical reality, civilising and refining Nature and the human form with the help of a brush." The high quality of the painting is highlighted when compared to the <a href="National%20Gallery%20%28London%29">National Gallery's</a> very similar workshop painting. The London subject has softer, more rounded features and is younger and less individually characterised than the c. 1460 model. The technique also is less subtle and fine in the London work. However, both share a similar expressions and dress.

Van der Weyden was more concerned with the aesthetic and emotional response created by the pictures overall than in the specific portraits. Art historian and curator <a href="Lorne%20Campbell%20%28art%20historian%29">Lorne Campbell</a> suggests that the popularity of the portrait is due more to the "elegant simplicity of the pattern which [the sitter] creates" than to the grace of her depiction. While van der Weyden did not stay within the traditional realms of idealisation, he created his own aesthetic, which he extended across his portraits and religious pictures. This aesthetic includes the mood of sorrowful devotion which forms the dominant tone in all his portraits. His figures may be more natural than those of earlier generations of artists; however, his individualistic approach to the depiction of his sitters' piety often leads to the abandonment of the rules of scale.

John Walker, former director of the National Gallery of Art, referred to the subject as "outré", but believed that despite the awkwardness of her individual features, the model was nonetheless "strangely beautiful". By the time of the work's completion van der Weyden had eclipsed even van Eyck in popularity, and this painting is typical of the austere spirituality, over the latter's sensuality, for which van der Weyden is renowned.

Although van der Weyden did not title the work, and the sitter's name is not recorded in any of the early inventories, the style of her dress has been used to place the picture very late in van der Weyden's career. The c. 1460 dating is based on the high-fashion dress and the work's apparent chronological position in the evolution of van der Weyden's style. However, it is possible that it was executed even later (van der Weyden died in 1464).

"Portrait of a Lady " was painted on a single oak board with a vertical grain and has an unpainted margin on each side. The panel was prepared with <a href="gesso">gesso</a>, upon which the figure was then painted in monochrome. Glazes of oil pigment were then added, which allowed for subtle and transparent tonal gradations. <a href="Infrared%23Art%20history">Infra-red reflectography</a> reveals that van der Weyden did not sketch the work on the board before he began to paint, and there is no evidence of <a href="underdrawing">underdrawing</a>. It shows that the lady was portrayed as more slender before changes were made as the work progressed; thickly applied background paint underlies some of the belt, demonstrating that the original silhouette was widened. These changes are also visible in <a href="x-ray">x-ray</a> images. It is in relatively good condition, having been cleaned a number of times, most recently in 1980. There is some loss of paint on the veil, headdress and sleeve, and abrasion on the ear.

The <a href="Provenance%23Works%20of%20art%20and%20antiques">provenance</a> of the painting is unclear, and there is doubt as to which painting is referred to in some early inventories. An <a href="Anhalt">Anhalt</a> prince, likely <a href="Leopold%20III%2C%20Duke%20of%20Anhalt-Dessau">Leopold Friedrich Franz</a> (d. 1817) of <a href="W%C3%B6rlitz">Wörlitz</a>, near <a href="Dessau">Dessau</a>, Germany, held it in the early 19th century, after which it is likely to have passed to <a href="Leopold%20IV%2C%20Duke%20of%20Anhalt">Leopold Friedrich</a> (d. 1871). The painting was loaned for exhibition in 1902, when it was shown at the Hôtel de Gouvernement Provincial, <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a> at the "<a href="Exposition%20des%20primitifs%20flamands%20%C3%A0%20Bruges">Exposition des primitifs flamands et d'art ancien</a>". It was held by a Duke of Anhalt until 1926 when he sold it to the art dealers <a href="Duveen%20Brothers">Duveen Brothers</a>. They in turn sold it that year to <a href="Andrew%20W.%20Mellon">Andrew W. Mellon</a>. It was loaned the following year to the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy of Arts</a>, London, for an exhibition covering six centuries of Flemish and Belgian art. Mellon willed the work to his Educational and Charitable Trust in 1932, which in 1937 donated it to the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Art">National Gallery of Art</a> where it is on permanent display.

Leslie Hubert (Les) Holden, <a href="Military%20Cross">MC</a>, <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">AFC</a> (6 March 1895 – 18 September 1932) was an Australian <a href="flying%20ace">fighter ace</a> of World War I and later a commercial aviator. A <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>n, he joined the <a href="Australian%20Light%20Horse">Light Horse</a> in May 1915, serving in Egypt and France. In December 1916, he volunteered for the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> and qualified as a pilot. As a member of <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadron</a> on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, he gained the sobriquets "Lucky Les" and "the homing pigeon" after a series of incidents that saw him limping back to base in bullet-riddled aircraft. He was awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a>, and went on to achieve five aerial victories flying <a href="Airco%20DH.5">Airco DH.5</a>s and <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20S.E.5">Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5</a>s.

Promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a>, Holden finished the war as an instructor with <a href="No.%206%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 6 (Training) Squadron</a> in England, where his work earned him the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Air Force Cross</a>. After leaving the Australian Flying Corps in 1919, he became a manager at the family firm of <a href="Holden">Holden's Motor Body Builders</a> and joined the part-time <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Citizen Air Force</a>, before setting up as a commercial pilot and establishing his own air service. In 1929, he located <a href="Charles%20Kingsford%20Smith">Charles Kingsford Smith</a> and <a href="Charles%20Ulm">Charles Ulm</a> in the north-west Australian desert after the pair was reported missing on a flight to England in the "<a href="Southern%20Cross%20%28aircraft%29">Southern Cross</a>". Holden began transport operations in New Guinea in 1931. He was killed the following year in a passenger plane crash in Australia.

Leslie Hubert Holden was born on 6 March 1895 in <a href="Adelaide">East Adelaide</a>, South Australia, to travelling businessman Hubert William Holden and his wife Annie Maria. Les was the nephew of Henry Holden, who later founded the Adelaide-based firm <a href="Holden">Holden's Motor Body Builders</a> with his son <a href="Edward%20Holden">Edward</a>. Hubert Holden landed a partnership with <a href="Nestl%C3%A9">Nestlé</a> in 1905, and the family moved to <a href="Turramurra%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Turramurra</a>, New South Wales. Les completed his education at <a href="Sydney%20Church%20of%20England%20Grammar%20School">Sydney Church of England Grammar School</a>, and joined Nestlé in 1911 as a salesman. By the time <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20I">Australia entered World War I</a> in August 1914, he was an assistant manager.

Holden enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> on 26 May 1915, and was posted to the <a href="4th%20Light%20Horse%20Brigade">4th Light Horse Brigade</a> as a <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a>. He departed for Egypt aboard the transport A29 "Suevic" on 13 June. Serving as a driver first in the <a href="Middle%20Eastern%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20I">Middle East</a> and then on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, his mechanical ability and sense of adventure led him to volunteer for the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> (AFC) in December 1916. After qualifying as a pilot in England, he was commissioned a <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> and posted to <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadron</a>. Commanded by Major <a href="Oswald%20Watt">Oswald Watt</a>, No. 2 Squadron's personnel included many former Lighthorsemen, as well as mechanics from the AFC's first combat formation, the <a href="Mesopotamian%20Half%20Flight">Mesopotamian Half Flight</a>. The force trained extensively in England commencing in January 1917, before deploying to the Western Front that September. Holden was involved in the AFC's first day of combat in France; just after noon on 2 October, in the vicinity of <a href="Saint-Quentin%2C%20Aisne">Saint-Quentin</a>, he and his wingman engaged a German two-seater that managed to escape.

Because its <a href="Airco%20DH.5">Airco DH.5</a>s were handicapped as <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a> by engine problems and low speed, No. 2 Squadron was employed mainly in <a href="Close%20air%20support">ground support</a> duties. During the fog-shrouded opening day of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cambrai%20%281917%29">Battle of Cambrai</a> on 20 November, Holden bombed and machine-gunned a German communications trench from altitudes as low as . He returned to a forward airfield near <a href="Havrincourt">Havrincourt Wood</a> with his plane "a flying wreck", in the words of the <a href="Official%20History%20of%20Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201914%E2%80%931918">official history of Australia in the war</a>. "Every part of it was shot full of holes, including petrol-tank, tail-plane, both <a href="longeron">longeron</a>s, and part of the undercarriage, while the elevator control was shot clean away." Two days later he repeated the exercise with similar consequences for his aircraft—"clear evidence of the dangers of the work and of his own good luck", as the official history put it. This brace of close calls gained him the nicknames "Lucky Les" and "the homing pigeon". He was recommended for the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> on 3 December for his actions of 20 November. The award was promulgated in the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 4 February 1918, and the citation appeared on 5 July:

Holden claimed his first aerial victory while No. 2 Squadron was still flying DH.5s, before it began converting to <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20S.E.5">Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5</a>s in December 1917. On 18 February 1918, he shared in one of the unit's first two victories in the S.E.5, helping send an <a href="Albatros%20Flugzeugwerke">Albatros</a> down in a spin. He claimed another three aircraft shot down over the following month, giving him a total of five victories. At least one of these took place during the <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a>, on 22 March, when all available Allied aircraft were thrown into battle to stem the German advance.

<a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> policy required pilots to be rotated to home establishment for rest and instructional duties after nine to twelve months in combat. Promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a> in March 1918, Holden was posted to England in May as a flying instructor with <a href="No.%206%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 6 (Training) Squadron</a> at <a href="Minchinhampton">Minchinhampton</a>. His unit was part of the <a href="No.%201%20Wing%20RAAF">1st Training Wing</a>, led by Lieutenant Colonel Watt, the former commanding officer of No. 2 Squadron. Holden briefly took command of No. 6 Squadron from 25 July to 11 August. He was awarded the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Air Force Cross</a>, promulgated on 3 June 1919, for his skill as an instructor.

No. 6 Squadron was disbanded in March 1919. Along with many other Australian Flying Corps personnel including Colonel Watt, Major <a href="Elwyn%20Roy%20King">Roy King</a>, and Captain <a href="Garnet%20Malley">Garnet Malley</a>, Holden departed for Australia on 6 May aboard the troopship "Kaisar-i-Hind", disembarking in Sydney on 19 June. He was discharged from the AFC on 18 August 1919. After taking part in the Commonwealth Government's Peace Loan flights, he joined Holden's Motor Body Builders as its Sydney manager. In May 1921, he served with Malley and other veteran pilots as a pall-bearer at Watt's funeral in <a href="Randwick%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Randwick</a>. Holden married Kathleen Packman at St Mark's Anglican Church in <a href="Darling%20Point%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Darling Point</a> on 3 June 1924; the couple had three daughters. On 19 June 1925, the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) established the Citizen Air Force as a part-time active reserve, and Holden became one of its first recruits. Ranked <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>, he served as a pilot with <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a>, which operated <a href="Airco%20DH.9">Airco DH.9</a>s and S.E.5s. Formed at <a href="RAAF%20Williams">RAAF Point Cook</a>, Victoria, it transferred to the newly opened <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Richmond</a>, New South Wales, during 29–30 June; Holden and Malley touched down at Richmond with the first two S.E.5s on the 30th.

Still hankering after a full-time career in flying, Holden enlisted the help of friends to purchase a <a href="De%20Havilland%20Giant%20Moth">de Havilland DH.61 Giant Moth</a> in 1928. He named it "Canberra", and used it to start a charter operation out of <a href="Sydney%20Airport">Mascot Aerodrome</a> in Sydney. Holden became a national celebrity in April 1929 when he successfully undertook an aerial search of the north-western Australian wilderness to locate <a href="Charles%20Kingsford%20Smith">Charles Kingsford Smith</a> and <a href="Charles%20Ulm">Charles Ulm</a>, after the pair had gone missing on a flight from Sydney to England in the "<a href="Southern%20Cross%20%28aircraft%29">Southern Cross</a>". Two other searchers, Keith Anderson and Bob Hitchcock, were lost in their aircraft, the "Kookaburra". The media of the day turned on Smith and Ulm, accusing them of a publicity stunt, and the Sydney Citizens' Relief Committee, which had commissioned Holden to undertake the rescue operation, withheld payment of his expenses. He nevertheless continued flying commercially, and is credited with making—in September 1931—possibly the first flight from Sydney to New Guinea, where he started an air freight service. Returning to Sydney the following year, he established Holden's Air Transport Services. He also acquired two more aircraft for his New Guinea operations, a <a href="Waco%20Aircraft%20Company">Waco</a> and a Moth, to supplement the "Canberra".
On 18 September 1932, Holden was travelling as a passenger aboard a <a href="List%20of%20defunct%20airlines%20of%20Oceania">New England Airways</a> <a href="De%20Havilland%20Puss%20Moth">DH.80 Puss Moth</a> from Sydney to <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> when it crashed at <a href="Byron%20Bay%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Byron Bay</a> in northern New South Wales, killing him instantly. The other occupants, pilot Ralph Virtue and the joint owner of the "Canberra", Holden's schoolfriend Dr George Hamilton, also perished. Investigations determined that the Puss Moth, VH-UPM, had gone down as a result of wing failure caused by <a href="aileron">aileron</a> flutter. A crowded memorial service for Holden and Hamilton took place at Sydney Church of England Grammar School on 20 September; they were cremated that afternoon at <a href="Rookwood%20Cemetery">Rookwood Cemetery</a>, where eighteen aircraft piloted by friends and associates of the pair overflew the chapel. Holden was survived by his wife and children. His father Hubert carried on operating Holden's Air Transport Services, floating it as a public corporation and serving as chairman. Les Holden, George Hamilton, and one of their schoolmates who had also recently died, Henry Braddon, were commemorated with a memorial stained-glass window at the Sydney Church of England Grammar School chapel in 1934. Holden was also honoured by Holden Street, built in the Sydney suburb of <a href="Maroubra%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Maroubra</a> in 1943.

Into Temptation (film)

Into Temptation is a 2009 independent drama film written and directed by Patrick Coyle, and starring <a href="Jeremy%20Sisto">Jeremy Sisto</a>, <a href="Kristin%20Chenoweth">Kristin Chenoweth</a>, <a href="Brian%20Baumgartner">Brian Baumgartner</a>, <a href="Bruce%20A.%20Young">Bruce A. Young</a> and Amy Matthews. It tells the story of a prostitute (Chenoweth) who confesses to a <a href="Catholicism">Catholic</a> priest (Sisto) that she plans to kill herself on her birthday. The priest attempts to find and save her, and in doing so plunges himself into a darker side of society.

The film was partially inspired by Coyle's father, a kind but belligerent man who had considered becoming a priest in his early life. The script won the McKnight Screenwriting Fellowship from the IFP Minnesota Center for Media Arts. "Into Temptation" was filmed and set in Coyle's hometown of <a href="Minneapolis%2C%20Minnesota">Minneapolis, Minnesota</a>. Several supporting roles were filled with actors from the <a href="Minneapolis%20%E2%80%93%20Saint%20Paul">Minneapolis – Saint Paul</a> theater area, and Coyle himself performed in a supporting role.

It was produced by Ten Ten Films and Farnam Street II, and distributed by <a href="First%20Look%20Studios">First Look International</a>. With a budget of less than $1 million, filming began in May 2008. Cinematography was provided by David Doyle, Russell Holsapple composed the score, and Lee Percy worked as editor. The film touches on themes of temptation, sin, good and evil, redemption and celibacy, as well as the boundaries between a priest providing counsel and getting personally involved with helping parishioners.

"Into Temptation" was <a href="Option%20%28filmmaking%29">optioned</a> in <a href="Hollywood%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Hollywood</a>, but talks fell through due to complications from the <a href="financial%20crisis%20of%202007-2010">global recession</a>. The film did not receive a national release but played at theaters in several cities. Although first publicly shown for Coyle's father in December 2008, "Into Temptation" officially premiered on April 26, 2009, at the <a href="Newport%20Beach%20Film%20Festival">Newport Beach Film Festival</a>, where Sisto won the "Outstanding Achievement in Acting" award. The film received generally positive reviews. It was released on DVD on October 27, 2009.

Father John Buerlein (<a href="Jeremy%20Sisto">Jeremy Sisto</a>) is the mild-mannered <a href="Catholicism">Catholic</a> priest of a small parish in <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a>, <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>. Overworked and underpaid, he has grown jaded with the profession and has trouble connecting with his parishioners. During confession, a mysterious and unnamed prostitute (<a href="Kristin%20Chenoweth">Kristin Chenoweth</a>) confesses to a sin she has not yet committed: she plans to commit suicide on her birthday. Father John is taken aback. The confession ends abruptly, and he is unable to stop the woman before she disappears. He only knows she wears a crucifix and is an <a href="Aries%20%28astrology%29">Aries</a>, which means her birthday is soon. Father John grows obsessed with finding and helping this woman, and begins visiting the city's <a href="red-light%20district">red-light district</a> with the hopes of finding her. On his way home, Father John meets a homeless man named Gus (Gene Larche), but with no money for him, he gives him a <a href="rosary">rosary</a> instead. Later, he seeks counsel from his friend Father Ralph O'Brien (<a href="Brian%20Baumgartner">Brian Baumgartner</a>), who advises him not to become too personally involved.
Father John returns to the red-light district and speaks to a prostitute named Miriam (Greta Oglesby), who suggests a powerful <a href="pimp">pimp</a> named James St. Clair (Ansa Akyea) might know about the woman. As they speak in a bar, the mysterious prostitute enters and solicits a <a href="John%20%28prostitution%29">john</a> (Patrick Coyle), who leaves with her immediately. As she goes, Father John catches a glimpse of the crucifix she is wearing and tries to chase her down. She leaves in the john's car before he can catch them, but he writes down the license plate as they drive off. Back at church, his sermons start to grow more unorthodox, and Father Ralph warns him that his unusual church manner and trips to the red-light district have the <a href="archbishop">archbishop</a> concerned. Meanwhile, Father John is contacted by his ex-girlfriend Nadine Brennan (Amy Matthews), who tells him she is divorcing her husband and still harbors romantic feelings for Father John.

Father John learns the john's car belongs to an accountant named Steven Miller, who tells Father John the prostitute is Linda, an expensive call girl who is widely considered among the best at her profession. Meanwhile, Linda visits her dying, elderly stepfather Donald Dupree (Tom Carey), who repeatedly raped Linda in her childhood and ultimately set her on the path to prostitution. Linda confronts him about their past, but claims she has forgiven him his sins, even though he continues to deny any wrongdoing. A drunk Nadine goes to talk to Father John in confession about her loneliness and feelings for him. He admits to caring for her as well, but they agree to remain friends. Later, Father John hires Lloyd Montag (<a href="Bruce%20A.%20Young">Bruce A. Young</a>), an unemployed boxer at his church, to serve as his bodyguard as he talks to St. Clair. The pimp, who knows Lloyd from his boxing days, tells Father John what neighborhood Linda lives in. There, Father John and Lloyd find Zeke (<a href="Tony%20Papenfuss">Tony Papenfuss</a>), a taxi driver who knows they are looking for Linda and agrees to take them to her apartment. Zeke explains he had driven her to the church when she first spoke to Father John at confession, and Zeke later visited the church to watch Father John preach.

At the apartment, Father John and Lloyd find Linda has moved out, but they discover she had possessed a 12-year-old newspaper clipping about Father John's ordination. Father John offers Lloyd a job helping out at the church, which Lloyd accepts. Father John then returns to his church and cries, fearing he is too late to save Linda. Meanwhile, Linda goes to a bridge and is about to jump off when she encounters Gus, who offers her the rosary he received earlier from Father John. A grateful and emotional Linda hugs Gus. It is not revealed whether she commits suicide or not. In a confession to Father Ralph, Father John expresses guilt he did not absolve Linda before her confession abruptly ended. Father Ralph says that even if Linda is dead, her soul is immortal, and that Father John's penance is to absolve her now. Father John does so. The film ends with a childhood memory of young Linda at church, where a group of boys laugh at her old torn clothes until she is defended by a young John Buerlein, whose act seems to make a strong positive impact upon her.

"Into Temptation" marks the second film by independent filmmaker Patrick Coyle, who wrote and directed the 2003 drama film "Detective Fiction". Coyle said "Into Temptation" was partially inspired by his father, James Patrick Coyle, a kind but belligerent man who had been encouraged by his mother to become a priest. James entered seminary but dropped out before ordination after he was drafted into serving overseas in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and met Margaret Mary Quinlan, who would become his wife and Patrick Coyle's mother. Coyle conceived of the script for "Into Temptation" while imagining what kind of priest his father would have been. His father strongly approved of the project, and told Coyle, "Go make that movie. And tell the truth." Coyle was also partially inspired by his childhood pastor and friend, the Reverend Damian Zuerlein, who performed the marriage ceremony for Coyle and his wife and baptized their children. Coyle said of him, "He's just a young, energetic, competent, committed, devoted man working with a poor parish. And he loves his work. I was inspired by that." Coyle said when writing "Into Temptation", he did not intend to make a religious film, and said of protagonist Father John Buerlein, "The character could have been a minister or a rabbi or a public defender. He's a good man trying to do a job the best he can."

Ann Luster, the film's producer, helped with the script from the earliest stages, and claimed she and Coyle had a deep understanding of how to handle the characters from the start. The film was set in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where Coyle lived and worked as a writer and actor at the time. The fictional church in the story, St. Mary Magdalen's Downtown Catholic Church, is based in part on the St. Mary Magdalene church in <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha</a>, <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, where Coyle was raised. However, the real-life church was also very different from the fictional church in that it lacked a shelter and drew very large congregations for weekend <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">mass</a>, compared to the half-empty pews in the fictional church. The fictional church is also based in part on Our Lady of Guadalupe, another Catholic church in south Omaha. The "Into Temptation" script won the McKnight Screenwriting Fellowship from IFP Minnesota Center for Media Arts, and investors were sought through public readings. After reading the script, Patrick Coyle's wife said, "If you get a good Father John, you'll have a good movie."

Jeremy Sisto said he was drawn to the script, and was excited to take on a different project than his regular role of Detective <a href="Cyrus%20Lupo">Cyrus Lupo</a> on the NBC crime drama series "<a href="Law%20%26amp%3B%20Order">Law & Order</a>". Sisto said of working on the show, "For nine months we basically do the same episode over and over. This ["Into Tempation" script] came out of nowhere." Sisto said of working on "Into Temptation": "Having just come off a job where there is little room to find true moments and to create a full character, I felt this respite from the task of trying to force a space where I could express something more personal through my job was no less than a creative life saver."
Coyle <a href="Cold%20calling">cold called</a> Kristin Chenoweth's agent and proposed the part, which is different from her usual roles, and her agent said it was the exact part the actress was seeking. In order to film "Into Temptation", Chenoweth took a five-day hiatus from her supporting role on the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> television series "<a href="Pushing%20Daisies">Pushing Daisies</a>". Brian Baumgartner, best known for his supporting role as <a href="Kevin%20Malone">Kevin Malone</a> in the <a href="NBC">NBC</a> comedy series "<a href="The%20Office%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">The Office</a>", was a regular theater performer in the <a href="Minneapolis%20%E2%80%93%20Saint%20Paul">Minneapolis – Saint Paul</a> area before joining that show. While visiting New York City in May 2008 for an <a href="Upfront%20%28advertising%29">upfront</a> presentation, shortly after having finished filming the <a href="The%20Office%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29%20season%204">fourth season</a> of "The Office", Baumgartner was offered the "Into Temptation" script by Coyle, who asked him to consider taking the role of Father Ralph O'Brien. Baumgartner said he enjoyed the script and agreed to the part.

Writer and director Patrick Coyle plays Steven Miller, one of Linda's clients. Many of the other minor roles were filled by local Minneapolis actors and community members. Greta Oglesby, who played the street-smart prostitute Miriam, and Isabell Monk O'Connor, who played a librarian who helps Father John, were both veterans of the Minneapolis – Saint Paul theater circuit. Ansa Akyea, who played pimp James St. Clair, and Amy Matthews, who played Father John's ex-girlfriend, were also from the Minneapolis – Saint Paul area.

"Into Temptation" was produced by Coyle's production company, Ten Ten Films, and the company Farnam Street II, in association with Cabin 14 Productions. It was distributed by <a href="First%20Look%20Studios">First Look International</a>. About a year before the film was released, Coyle asked Anne Marie Gillen to serve as <a href="executive%20producer">executive producer</a>. Gillen said she had not responded to a script in such an emotional way since the 1991 drama film "<a href="Fried%20Green%20Tomatoes%20%28film%29">Fried Green Tomatoes</a>", which she also produced. Filming, which began in May 2008, took place entirely in Minneapolis. It included several scenes staged in the city's <a href="Uptown%2C%20Minneapolis">Uptown</a> commercial district, where Coyle lived.

In addition to his personal connections to the city, Coyle said filming took place in Minneapolis because it was relatively inexpensive to shoot there and hire local actors. He said, "Shooting in Uptown is a filmmaker's paradise. You've got everything here." "Into Tempation" was produced and shot on a very low budget of less than $1 million. Cinematography was provided by David Doyle, who made extensive use of the <a href="Red%20Digital%20Cinema%20Camera%20Company">Red Digital Cinema Camera</a>. The church scenes were filmed at the Incarnation Church in the city. Sisto and Chenoweth both attended mass services at the church as part of their research for the roles. Exterior car scenes were shot in the Uptown district. During one scene in particular, a police car with a siren passed by the actors during a shot. The actors continued uninterrupted, and the final shot was used in the film.

Coyle approached Russell Holsapple, a Minneapolis – Saint Paul native and relatively inexperienced composer, to create the score for "Into Temptation". Holsapple was given only a few weeks to create the score, which was composed mostly of piano music. Holsapple said Coyle gave him a great deal of artistic freedom and was largely receptive to the themes he wrote. James R. Bakkom worked as production designer on the film, and Deborah Fiscus served as costume designer. Both are natives of the Minneapolis – Saint Paul area. Vanessa Miles was set decorator, while Sarah Jean Kruchowski and Amy Hubbard both worked as art directors.

Lee Percy served as editor of the film. He said the final cuts provided to him already contained the actors' strongest performances, but that he placed a greater focus on Father John's character in an effort to "help the audience get inside him and connect emotionally". Percy was assisted by editor Scott Ferril. Patrick Coyle's father, Jim, followed production of the film closely, making weekly calls to inquire about it. When his father's health started to decline, Patrick Coyle "worked like hell" to finish the film quickly so his father could see it before he died. The film was finished in December 2008.

"Into Temptation" was <a href="Option%20%28filmmaking%29">optioned</a> in <a href="Hollywood%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Hollywood</a>, but Coyle was displeased when industry officials wanted him to change the ending and make the sex scenes more risque. Due to complications from the <a href="financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%932010">financial crisis of 2007–2010</a>, the Hollywood discussions eventually collapsed. It did not receive a national release, but played at theaters in New York City, Los Angeles, <a href="Fargo%2C%20North%20Dakota">Fargo, North Dakota</a>, and several cities throughout Minnesota, including Minneapolis and <a href="Duluth%2C%20Minnesota">Duluth</a>. Coyle first publicly showed the film on December 26, 2008, at the Omaha hospice where his father Jim was staying for an audience of about 15 people. Jim Coyle, who died a few weeks after the screening, loved the film, describing it as very powerful and truthful. It officially premiered on April 26, 2009, at the <a href="Newport%20Beach%20Film%20Festival">Newport Beach Film Festival</a> in <a href="Newport%20Beach%2C%20California">Newport Beach, California</a>.

During its opening weekend at the Lagoon Cinema in Minneapolis, "Into Temptation" sold more tickets in three days than any other film during its debut weekend, and sold twice the tickets of such major studio films as "<a href="Taking%20Woodstock">Taking Woodstock</a>" and <a href="Quentin%20Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a>'s "<a href="Inglourious%20Basterds">Inglourious Basterds</a>". This resulted in an extended run and strong word-of-mouth that led to exhibitions in other cities. The film earned a total of $97,457 in gross revenue in the United States. The "Into Temptation" DVD was released on October 27, 2009, with no bonus features.

"Into Temptation" received generally positive reviews. "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" magazine writer Rob Nelson called it a well-photographed film of "occasionally irreverent wit", and that Coyle "strikes a near-perfect balance between humor and holiness". Nelson said the film "falters only in its hokey characterization" of the Chenoweth character. Colin Covert of the "<a href="Star%20Tribune">Star Tribune</a>" called it a "haunting, carefully crafted movie" with simple "matter-of-fact" direction, a "trim and efficient" screenplay, strong acting and solid characters. Covert said, "This is one of very few American films to deal with religious beliefs about faith and salvation with empathy and insight." "<a href="OC%20Weekly">OC Weekly</a>" writer Matt Coker said "Into Temptation" had a cohesive script which "strikes just the right cord of reverence for the Catholic faith". He also praised the moments of comic relief with Sisto and Baumgartner, which he said complimented some of the film's heavier moments. L. Kent Wolgamott of the "<a href="Lincoln%20Journal%20Star">Lincoln Journal Star</a>" called "Into Temptation" a well-made film that "gets the mood right from start to finish". He complimented the performances and said although pornography and prostitution were familiar film topics, "the film's nuanced understanding of the priest and his conflicted role in trying to save Linda adds a new element to the old story."

Bob Fischbach of the "<a href="Omaha%20World-Herald">Omaha World-Herald</a>" called the cinematography sharp, the editing crisp, and the acting "uniformly good". He added, "Best of all, the writing is anchored in reality. Coyle lets his film show rather than tell, and lets viewers reach their own conclusions." "<a href="Lavender%20%28magazine%29">Lavender</a>" magazine writer John Townsend said the film conveyed compassionate views of Christianity and complimented the cinematography. Townsend particularly praised Baumgartner's performance and described the scenes between Sisto and a young boy troubled by his homosexual feelings (John Skelley) as "exquisite". Chelsa Doyle, a writer with the website <a href="Blogcritics">Blogcritics</a>, called it "a touching and introspective film about faith, hope and choice". Doyle praised the film's quiet tone and the performances of Sisto and Chenoweth, but said it "occasionally gets a little sleepy in the middle", and that the subplot involving Father John's ex-girlfriend could have been cut altogether. "<a href="Denver%20Post">Denver Post</a>" film critic Lisa Kennedy praised the performances of Sisto and Chenoweth, and complimented Coyle's understanding of the pastoral work of a parish priest. However, she added that the film "doesn't break ground as a story, even one about redemption". Andrea Gronvall of the "<a href="Chicago%20Reader">Chicago Reader</a>" called it a "cheesy melodrama", and wrote, "Writer-director Patrick Coyle tackles such weighty issues as child abuse, alcoholism, hypocrisy, celibacy, and Catholic reforms, but the movie's spiritual agenda is belied by its voyeurism."

Jeremy Sisto was awarded "Outstanding Achievement in Acting" from the 2009 Newport Beach Film Festival awards.

Throughout the film, Father John is warned that his role as a priest comes with boundaries, and that he should not become personally involved with the congregants or try to solve their problems except through counseling. However, Father John begins to question those boundaries and reconsider whether the role as priest goes far enough in having a positive, substantive impact on the lives of those in his care, particularly Linda. And, in addition to questioning whether he is helping his congregants, Father John questions whether staying within those boundaries is enough to personally fulfill himself as a priest and provide his own life with meaning. He ultimately crosses over those boundaries and gets personally involved in trying to help Linda by delving into the city's red-light district to seek her.

The film takes a modern, liberal approach to the rules and constraints of Catholicism. Even before Father John decides to help Linda, he is questioning the constraints of his religion and calling. While speaking to a prospective mother struggling over whether to raise her daughter within the strict confines of Catholicism, Father John gives her advice beyond the official dogma and encourages her to be flexible, telling her she should "take what works" from the church teachings. Father John also has an unorthodox view of homosexuality compared to the normal views of the church. This is demonstrated in a scene in which the priest comforts a young man who is struggling with his homosexual feelings. In meeting and interacting with the pimps and prostitutes of the red-light district, "Into Temptation" blurs the lines between good and evil, and between right and wrong. The negative responses Father John encounters from congregants and the church regarding his trips to the red-light district demonstrate the way sex and poverty are often stigmatized in society.

As the title suggests, one of the major themes of the film involves the temptations Father John faces to sin and stray from his priestly calling. This is perhaps most strongly manifested in his apparent ambivalence regarding the <a href="Clerical%20celibacy">vow of celibacy</a> required of Catholic priests. As Father John goes deeper into the red-light district and the seedier aspects of Minneapolis, he appears to face temptations from the prostitution and overt sexuality surrounding him. Additionally, it can be interpreted that his interest in Linda is one of physical attraction, as well as a desire to help her. This is further manifested through the sudden reappearance of his former girlfriend, for whom Father John admits to still harboring romantic feelings. The priest demonstrates conflicting emotions when it comes to maintaining his priestly vows and his relationship with Nadine.

"Into Temptation" is also a story of redemption, both for Linda, who is seeking redemption for a life of sin and prostitution, and for Father John, who is seeking redemption for his failure to help Linda and his own doubts about religion and priesthood. At the start of the film, Father John appears to be questioning his duty to the church and its dwindling congregation; this is especially demonstrated when he appears bored during confession and does crossword puzzles to pass the time. Such struggles are not uncommon in priesthood. But after he resists the church boundaries and attempts to help Linda, his faith in the congregation and belief in the profession are restored, and he returns to the church a stronger and more content priest. The film demonstrates the power of compassion and individual kindness, particularly in the way that John's simple act of defending Linda during her childhood was such a profound moment in her life. The film also advocates repentance, and the extent of Linda's victimization can be interpreted as a sign of how catastrophic an unrepentant life can be.

<a href="Air%20Vice%20Marshal%20%28Australia%29">Air Vice Marshal</a> Allan Leslie Walters, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">CB</a>, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a>, <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">AFC</a> (2 November 1905 – 19 October 1968) was a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). Born in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> and raised in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, he graduated from the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, before transferring to the RAAF in 1928. He was considered one of the service's leading <a href="Flight%20instructor">flying instructors</a> and <a href="aerobatics">aerobatic</a> pilots between the wars, and was appointed to his first <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadron</a> command in 1937. Over the course of <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Walters led <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron</a> in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="No.%201%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 1 (Fighter) Wing</a> in <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Northern Territory, <a href="No.%2072%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 72 Wing</a> in <a href="Netherlands%20New%20Guinea">Dutch New Guinea</a>, and <a href="Northern%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Northern Command</a> in <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>. He was decorated with the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Air Force Cross</a> in 1941 for his work with No. 1 Squadron, and <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> in 1944 for his service with No. 72 Wing.

Walters was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in 1946 for his service with Northern Command. Already marked out for senior roles in the post-war RAAF, his positions during the 1950s included <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) <a href="Southern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Southern Area Command</a>, AOC <a href="RAAF%20Overseas%20Headquarters">RAAF Overseas Headquarters</a> in London, Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in Washington, D.C., AOC <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Home Command</a>, <a href="Air%20Member%20for%20Personnel%20%28Australia%29">Air Member for Personnel</a>, and AOC <a href="RAAF%20Support%20Command">Support Command</a>. He was promoted acting <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a> in 1952 (<a href="Military%20rank%23Types%20of%20rank">substantive</a> in 1954), and appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in 1956. Popularly known as "Wally", he was twice a candidate for <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, and twice passed over. He retired from the RAAF in 1962 and made his home in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, where he died in 1968 at the age of sixty-two.

Allan Leslie Walters was born on 2 November 1905 in <a href="Ascot%20Vale%2C%20Victoria">Ascot Vale</a>, Victoria, to schoolteacher Ferdinand Walters and his wife Edith. The family soon moved to <a href="Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia">Perth</a>, Western Australia, and Allan completed his education at Perth Modern School, where he joined the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Cadets">cadets</a>. After leaving school and spending eight months in the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">militia</a>, he entered the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, in February 1924. At Duntroon he specialised in <a href="field%20artillery">field artillery</a>, and excelled at athletics. Graduating as a <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in December 1927, he transferred to the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) on 1 February 1928. Walters' preferred career path in the military was engineering, and it was only when he failed to gain selection for this field after his graduation that he applied to transfer to the Air Force, which, having no cadet college of its own, had arranged with Duntroon to take one of its artillery specialists each year for as a pilot. He commenced his course at <a href="RAAF%20Williams">RAAF Point Cook</a>, Victoria, in mid-1928, and graduated as a <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> in March 1929. Walters showed an aptitude for instruction, and after further training was graded an 'A1' <a href="flight%20instructor">flight instructor</a>, a rare distinction. Posted to <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a>, New South Wales, operating <a href="Westland%20Wapiti">Westland Wapiti</a>s, he also made a name for himself performing <a href="aerobatics">aerobatics</a> at air shows throughout the country. Walters put this particular talent to use in pursuit of his wife-to-be, Jean Manning, stunt flying above All Saints Church, <a href="North%20Parramatta%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">North Parramatta</a>, where her father was <a href="Rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29">rector</a>. Reverend Manning married the couple there on 30 June 1930; their daughter Robin was born in Richmond.
Walters was granted a permanent commission in the Air Force in 1930. On 5 January 1931, by now promoted <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>, he won a trophy in an air obstacle race at the <a href="Cootamundra">Cootamundra</a> Air Pageant. In May the following year, he took out the NSW Air Derby and Evening News Cup. He temporarily commanded No. 3 Squadron during October 1933, in the absence of Squadron Leader <a href="William%20Bostock">Bill Bostock</a>. At the time, the commanding officer of No. 3 Squadron also held command of RAAF Station Richmond. Walters was posted to Britain in 1936 to attend the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover</a>, and was promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> in March 1937, while still overseas. He also undertook a naval reconnaissance course at <a href="RAF%20Manston">RAF Manston</a>. Returning to Australia in May, he took command of <a href="No.%2022%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 22 Squadron</a> in June, flying <a href="Hawker%20Demon">Hawker Demon</a>s and <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s out of Richmond until February 1938.

Between 6 and 23 February 1938, Walters piloted the first overseas flight in an aeroplane designed and built in Australia when he flew the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Vice Marshal <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a>, to <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> in a <a href="Tugan%20Gannet">Tugan Gannet</a>. He returned to Richmond in May 1938 to lead No. 3 Squadron, operating Demons, and again took part in aerobatic displays. On 25 October 1938, his Demon crashed in scrub at <a href="Tumbi%20Umbi%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Tumbi Umbi</a>, New South Wales, when the engine failed shortly after taking off for Richmond, but he was not injured. Completing his Richmond appointment in May 1939, Walters transferred to <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> as Director of Staff Duties at RAAF Headquarters. Later that month, he joined Group Captain <a href="Henry%20Wrigley">Henry Wrigley</a> as an expert assessor on the panel of an inquiry into a recent series of three Anson accidents; the full report handed down in October found human error the likely explanation for at least one crash and that training on the type followed the syllabus laid down, but that pilots needed more practical experience in dealing with potential in-flight incidents.

Walters' first operational appointment following the outbreak of <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">World War II</a> was as commanding officer of <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron</a>, which he led to <a href="Sembawang">Sembawang</a>, Singapore, in July 1940. His promotion to temporary <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> was announced the same month. He had earlier travelled incognito to Singapore on a <a href="Qantas">Qantas</a> <a href="Short%20Empire">Empire flying boat</a>, which had been specifically requested to deviate from its normal flight path so that he could reconnoiter airfields in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>. Deployed in response to fears of <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> expansion in <a href="Malaysia">Malaya</a>, No. 1 Squadron was the first Australian unit equipped with <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a> light bombers, which were employed primarily for <a href="maritime%20patrol">maritime patrol</a> work. Walters was awarded the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Air Force Cross</a> for his "very active part in all operations" and for training his unit to "a particularly high standard"; the honour was <a href="London%20Gazette">gazetted</a> in the 1941 <a href="King%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">King's Birthday Honours</a>. He succeeded <a href="Frank%20Lukis">Frank Lukis</a> as commanding officer of <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Station Laverton</a>, Victoria, in May the same year, and was promoted acting <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a>. In May 1942, he joined Allied Air Forces Headquarters, <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">South West Pacific Area</a> (SWPA), in Melbourne as Assistant Director of Operations. He was made a temporary group captain in September, and transferred to Headquarters <a href="RAAF%20Command">RAAF Command</a> as senior air staff officer.

On 7 October 1942, Walters took command of a new formation, <a href="No.%201%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 1 (Fighter) Wing</a>, at RAAF Station Richmond. Established to boost the air defence capability of Australia's <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western Area</a>, the wing comprised three <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> squadrons that had been transferred from Europe: <a href="No.%2054%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 54 Squadron RAF</a>, <a href="No.%20452%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 452 Squadron RAAF</a> and <a href="No.%20457%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 457 Squadron RAAF</a>. With Wing Commander <a href="Clive%20Caldwell">Clive Caldwell</a>, Australia's top-scoring <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a> of the war, as his <a href="wing%20leader">wing leader</a>, Walters began deploying aircraft and men to <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Northern Territory, in December, providing a filip for morale in the region. Proudly declaring himself Australia's oldest fighter pilot, Walters was reported as taking every opportunity to join his men in the air. He flew as Caldwell's <a href="wingman">wingman</a> in No. 1 Wing's <a href="Raid%20on%20Darwin%20%282%20May%201943%29">first major action</a> against the Japanese over Darwin on 2 May 1943. Eight Spitfires crashed and several others made forced landings, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. Walters himself narrowly avoiding being shot down when he warned Caldwell of an attacking enemy fighter, to the detriment of his own safety. After they landed, Caldwell chided his commander, "You silly old so-and-so. You want to look after your own skin instead of worrying about someone else's!" On 20 June, Walters participated in the wing's most successful combat against the Japanese to that time, personally accounting for one of fourteen raiders claimed by the Spitfires, for the loss of two of their own number. He posted out of Darwin a few days later, having earned the admiration of Caldwell and the rest of the wing's personnel.
Walters assumed command of <a href="No.%205%20Service%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 5 Service Flying Training School</a> in <a href="Uranquinty">Uranquinty</a>, New South Wales, on 30 June 1943, but the next month was posted to <a href="Merauke">Merauke</a> in Dutch New Guinea to take over <a href="No.%2072%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 72 Wing</a> following reassignment of its original commander, Group Captain <a href="Charles%20Eaton%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Charles Eaton</a>. Comprising <a href="No.%2084%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 84 Squadron</a> (flying <a href="CAC%20Boomerang">CAC Boomerang</a> fighters), <a href="No.%2086%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 86 Squadron</a> (<a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20variants">Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk</a> fighters), and <a href="No.%2012%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 12 Squadron</a> (<a href="Vultee%20A-31%20Vengeance">Vultee A-31 Vengeance</a> dive bombers), No. 72 Wing came under the control of RAAF <a href="North-Eastern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Eastern Area Command</a>, and undertook air defence and patrol tasks in and around western New Guinea. Group Captain <a href="William%20Hely">Bill Hely</a> assumed command of No. 72 Wing in May 1944, and Walters was appointed Director of Staff Policy and Plans at RAAF Headquarters. He was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> on 28 October 1944 for his "Gallant & distinguished service" in North-Eastern Area, the award being promulgated on 9 March 1945.

In February 1945, Walters was promoted to acting <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a> and took over from Air Commodore Lukis as <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) <a href="Northern%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Northern Command</a>, directing its operations in New Guinea, <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a> and <a href="Bougainville%20Island">Bougainville</a> until the end of the war. Headquartered at <a href="Madang">Madang</a> in Papua New Guinea, Northern Command had previously been a large mobile formation known as <a href="No.%209%20Operational%20Group%20RAAF">No. 9 (Operational) Group</a> but had evolved into a garrison force, its mobile function supplanted by No. 10 (Operational) Group (later <a href="Australian%20First%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">First Tactical Air Force</a>). Northern Command's operational formations included <a href="No.%2071%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 71 Wing</a> in northern New Guinea, <a href="No.%2074%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 74 Wing</a> at <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a>, and <a href="No.%2084%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 84 Wing</a> on Bougainville. No. 71 Wing, commanded by Group Captain <a href="Valston%20Hancock">Val Hancock</a>, supported the <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">Australian 6th Division</a> during the <a href="Aitape%E2%80%93Wewak%20Campaign">Aitape–Wewak Campaign</a>, despite ordnance deficiencies that at one stage led to its squadrons arming their <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a>s with captured Japanese bombs. No. 84 Wing suffered shortages in pilots and equipment during the <a href="Bougainville%20Campaign">Bougainville Campaign</a>, and morale problems following the end of the war owing to inactivity and the uncertainties of demobilisation; as a result, the wing's commanding officer sent Northern Command headquarters a frank report, the tone of which earned a rebuke from Walters. In September, Walters represented the RAAF at the Japanese surrender ceremonies in <a href="Wewak">Wewak</a>.

Walters was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in the King's Birthday Honours on 25 June 1946, for his "conspicuous service in operations against the Japanese" while leading Northern Command during the war. After completing his term as AOC Northern Command that year, Walters again became Director of Staff Plans and Policy at RAAF Headquarters. He attended the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College, London</a>, in 1947. Walters was among a small coterie of highly regarded operational commanders, including Air Commodores <a href="John%20McCauley%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">John McCauley</a>, <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Fred Scherger</a> and Val Hancock, earmarked by the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Australian Air Board</a> for senior leadership roles in the post-war RAAF. In the short term, he remained a temporary air commodore—with the <a href="Military%20rank%23Types%20of%20rank">substantive rank</a> of group captain from May 1947—as the officer corps shrank drastically with demobilisation. He was selected as AOC <a href="Southern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Southern Area Command</a>, hub of the RAAF's training organisation, in March 1948. The following month, he flew to <a href="Morotai">Morotai</a> to preside over a <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a> for an RAAF airman accused of killing an officer of the Dutch merchant marine; the airman was acquitted.
In January 1951, Walters was appointed AOC <a href="RAAF%20Overseas%20Headquarters">RAAF Overseas Headquarters</a> in London. That December, he was part of the Australian contingent at the Commonwealth Air Forces Conference, where an RAAF presence was sought in the Middle East; this eventually resulted in <a href="No.%2078%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 78 Wing</a> being re-formed and deployed to Malta in July 1952. Although Walters was keen to use the opportunity to acquire the RAAF's first <a href="North%20American%20F-86%20Sabre">North American F-86 Sabre</a>s, political realities led him to negotiate a deal whereby the wing was equipped with leased British <a href="de%20Havilland%20Vampire">de Havilland Vampire FB.9s</a>. In October 1952, Walters was promoted to acting <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a> and posted to Washington, D.C., to head up the Australian Joint Services Staff as successor to Air Vice Marshal Scherger. Walters' rank was made permanent in January 1954, when he succeeded Air Vice Marshal McCauley to become AOC <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Home Command</a>. Walters held this post, responsible for directing the RAAF's combat units, for three years. His tenure witnessed the introduction of the <a href="CAC%20Sabre">CAC Sabre</a> to operational service with the Air Force, when No. 3 Squadron took delivery of its first machine in March 1956.

Walters was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> (CB) in the 1956 <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a>. In March 1957, he was one of three candidates, along with Air Vice Marshals Scherger and Hancock, touted as possible successors to Air Marshal Sir John McCauley as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), the RAAF's senior position. Though Walters was considered to be very able, Scherger had long been regarded as outstanding and was "easily the best material on offer" according to a former CAS, Air Marshal <a href="Donald%20Hardman">Sir Donald Hardman</a>. Scherger gained the appointment, and Walters became Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 21 October. As AMP he occupied a seat on the Air Board, the service's controlling body that comprised its senior officers and was chaired by the CAS. In this role Walters endorsed the recommendations of a review by the AOC Training Command, Air Vice Marshal <a href="Ian%20Dougald%20McLachlan">Ian McLachlan</a>, that led to a policy of <a href="RAAF%20College">RAAF College</a> cadets undertaking academic degrees, in line with similar institutions in the other armed services; the college was subsequently renamed RAAF Academy. Walters served as AMP until August 1959. The following month he was appointed AOC <a href="RAAF%20Support%20Command">Support Command</a>, a new organisation created by merging the RAAF's former Training and Maintenance Commands. When Scherger's term as CAS was due to complete in May 1961, Walters and Hancock were once more put forward to the <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Air</a> as potential replacements. "Walters was again unlucky", in the words of Air Force historians Alan Stephens and Keith Isaacs, Hancock's "professional ability, operational experience and personal qualities" being deemed more appropriate for the role.

Walters left the RAAF on 16 May 1962, after completing his posting at Headquarters Support Command. His pending retirement and succession by Air Vice Marshal <a href="Douglas%20Candy">Douglas Candy</a> had been announced the previous November. Walters followed horse racing in private life. Survived by his wife and daughter, he died from <a href="Cardiorenal%20syndrome">cardiorenal failure</a> in <a href="Heidelberg%2C%20Victoria">Heidelberg</a>, Melbourne, on 19 October 1968. He was accorded an Air Force funeral at The Scots Church, Melbourne, and cremated. His pall bearers included two former CASs, Air Marshals Sir Richard Williams and <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Sir George Jones</a>, along with Air Vice Marshals Henry Wrigley, <a href="Joe%20Hewitt%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Joe Hewitt</a>, <a href="Colin%20Hannah">Colin Hannah</a>, and Douglas Candy.

Muckaty Station

Muckaty Station, also known as Warlmanpa, is a <a href="Native%20title%20in%20Australia">Aboriginal freehold landholding</a> in Australia's <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a>, north of <a href="Tennant%20Creek%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Tennant Creek</a>, and approximately south of <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>. Originally under traditional <a href="Indigenous%20Australian">Indigenous Australian</a> ownership, the area became a <a href="pastoral%20lease">pastoral lease</a> in the late 19th century and for many years operated as a <a href="cattle%20station">cattle station</a>. It is traversed by the <a href="Stuart%20Highway">Stuart Highway</a>, built in the 1940s along the route of the service track for the <a href="Australian%20Overland%20Telegraph%20Line">Australian Overland Telegraph Line</a>. It is also crossed by the <a href="Amadeus%20Gas%20Pipeline">Amadeus Gas Pipeline</a> built in the mid-1980s, and the <a href="Adelaide%E2%80%93Darwin%20railway">Adelaide–Darwin railway</a>, completed in early 2004. Muckaty Station was returned to its Indigenous custodians in 1999.

The area comprises semi-arid stony ridges, <a href="claypan">claypan</a>s and a stony plateau, and experiences a sub-tropical climate, with a wet season between January and March. The vegetation is mostly <a href="scrubland">scrubland</a>, including <a href="Triodia%20%28plant%20genus%29">spinifex grasslands</a>. The fauna is generally typical of Australian desert environments, and includes the <a href="red%20kangaroo">red kangaroo</a>, the <a href="eastern%20wallaroo">eastern wallaroo</a>, the <a href="northern%20nail-tail%20wallaby">northern nail-tail wallaby</a>, and the <a href="spinifex%20hopping%20mouse">spinifex hopping mouse</a>.

A site within Muckaty was being considered for Australia's <a href="Low%20level%20waste">low-level</a> and intermediate-level <a href="radioactive%20waste">radioactive waste</a> storage and disposal facility. Indigenous custodians of Muckaty Station were divided over the proposal, which also met resistance from environmental organisations and the Northern Territory government. The plan was abandoned after a <a href="Federal%20Court%20of%20Australia">Federal Court of Australia</a> case in 2014.

<a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous Australians</a> have lived in parts of the Northern Territory for around 40,000 years. Pre-European settlement numbers are not known with any precision, although the Indigenous population of the Northern Territory has been estimated at "well over 10,000". The area now known as Muckaty Station (often referred to as just "Muckaty", though the origin of this name and near variants such as "Mucketty" is unknown) was – and is – the responsibility of seven <a href="clan">clan</a>s of traditional Indigenous owners: Milwayi, Ngapa, Ngarrka, Wirntiku, Kurrakurraja, Walanypirri and Yapayapa. The country is known by the Indigenous name Warlmanpa, which is also the name of a local language.

Although there had been several unsuccessful attempts by British or colonial authorities to settle in the Northern Territory, there was no permanent European presence until surveyor <a href="George%20Goyder">George Goyder</a> in 1869 established what is now known as <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>. The timing was auspicious: in October 1870 the South Australian government decided to construct an <a href="Australian%20Overland%20Telegraph%20Line">overland telegraph line</a>, from <a href="Port%20Augusta%2C%20South%20Australia">Port Augusta</a> on the continent's south coast, to the new settlement just established in the country's tropical north. The line traversed what is now Muckaty Station, with repeater stations built at Powell's Creek to the north and Tennant's Creek to the south. At the same time as the telegraph line was completed in August 1872, a cattle industry was beginning to develop in central and northern Australia. The first pastoral lease in the Northern Territory was granted in 1872, and by 1911 there were at least 250 such leases covering over of the jurisdiction. The Muckaty pastoral lease was created in the late 19th century. Currently the property is surrounded by other leases including Powell Creek to the north, <a href="Helen%20Springs%20Station">Helen Springs Station</a> to the east with Philip Creek and <a href="Banka%20Banka%20Station">Banka Banka Station</a>s to the south.
In the 1930s, the Australian government was sufficiently concerned about the condition and lack of development of these leases that it held two inquiries between 1932 and 1938. Historian Ted Ling's accounts of those inquiries, however, make no mention of Muckaty, which was not singled out for comment by either investigation.

Throughout the history of Australia's pastoral industry, Indigenous Australians were a major part of the workforce. In 1928 for example, 80 per cent of Indigenous people with jobs were employed on the stations, including Muckaty, with many living on and travelling across the pastoral leases. The local language, Warlmanpa, was recognised in some publications from the 1930s onward, while anthropologists and administrators made some records of language and population in the region of Muckaty Station. Only one record from the period lists both Muckaty Station as a location and Warlmanpa as a language. A record of Aboriginal <a href="ward%20%28law%29">wards of the state</a>, it showed only three Indigenous adults living on Muckaty, compared to almost fifty on <a href="Banka%20Banka%20Station">Banka Banka Station</a>, to the east. This reflects the fact that, by 1940, "Warlmanpa country had been depopulated".

By the 1940s the lessee at Muckaty was Fred Ulyatt. The 1940s also marked a significant change in the region's road infrastructure. A dirt track had been formed to service the telegraph line in the late nineteenth century. This became the <a href="Stuart%20Highway">Stuart Highway</a>, crossing the eastern part of Muckaty, and it was upgraded to an all-weather road in late 1940, before being <a href="Asphalt%20concrete">bitumenised</a> in 1944. Sources do not say who leased the property between the 1940s and 1982, at which point the lease was held by James and Miriam Hagan. In 1988 it was transferred to Hapford Pty Limited and Kerfield Pty Limited. Between 1985 and 1987 the <a href="Amadeus%20Gas%20Pipeline">Amadeus Gas Pipeline</a> was built across the station, carrying gas from <a href="Palm%20Valley%20Gas%20Field">Palm Valley Gas Field</a> in the <a href="Amadeus%20Basin">Amadeus Basin</a> to <a href="Channel%20Island%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Channel Island</a> near Darwin.

In 1991, the cattle station was taken over by the Muckaty Aboriginal Corporation. The Corporation focused on rehabilitating the land, which had been degraded by excessive numbers of cattle, and by late 1993 Muckaty had been destocked of cattle for several seasons. On 20 December 1991, the <a href="Northern%20Land%20Council">Northern Land Council</a> lodged a claim over Muckaty on behalf of traditional owners under the <a href="Aboriginal%20Land%20Rights%20Act%201976">Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976</a>. The claim was made by members of the seven groups that each has responsibility for different sites and <a href="dreaming%20%28spirituality%29">dreamings</a> in the area. In 1997, the Aboriginal Land Commissioner recommended that Muckaty Station be handed back to the traditional owners, and in February 1999, title to the land was returned. At the time there were about 400 formal traditional owners, among 1,000 people with traditional attachments to the land; some lived on the station, but others were elsewhere in the region, including in the nearby towns of <a href="Tennant%20Creek%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Tennant Creek</a> and <a href="Elliott%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Elliott</a>. As Aboriginal Freehold land it is inalienable communal title, and cannot be bought or sold. The pastoral lease holder and manager of the station since 1997 has been Ray Aylett. The <a href="Adelaide%E2%80%93Darwin%20railway">Adelaide–Darwin railway</a>, which passes through the western part of Muckaty Station, was completed in early 2004.

Muckaty Station covers an area of and lies north of Tennant Creek, in Australia's Northern Territory. It includes a homestead that lies west of the Stuart Highway and east of the railway. The residence has associated cattle yards, an airstrip, and workers' accommodation. It is adjacent to <a href="Banka%20Banka%20Station">Banka Banka Station</a> to the east, and Powell Creek Station (also referred to as an <a href="Outstation%20movement">outstation</a>) to the north.

The climate is subtropical, with a wet season between January and March, during which the area receives monthly rainfall of between . For the rest of the year there is usually less than of rain each month.

The station's geology is dominated by the Tomkinson Group, a <a href="formation%20%28stratigraphy%29">formation</a> comprising <a href="sedimentary">sedimentary</a> rocks of the <a href="Paleoproterozoic">Paleoproterozoic</a> era that is over 1.6 billion years old. The Tomkinson Group includes layers of coarse <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>s and <a href="conglomerate%20%28geology%29">conglomerates</a>, with some <a href="claystone">claystone</a> and <a href="siltstone">siltstone</a>, deposited in a <a href="fluvial">fluvial</a> to shallow marine environment. There are also <a href="Cambrian">Cambrian</a> basaltic rocks, particularly near the homestead. The eastern parts of the station form a stony plateau within the Ashburton Range. The central parts are flat and include <a href="claypan">claypan</a>s, while to the west are stony ridges. The region is drained by an <a href="ephemeral%20river">ephemeral waterway</a>, Tomkinson Creek, and is considered a good candidate to contain <a href="manganese">manganese</a> deposits, the mineral having been extracted in the 1950s and 1960s at the Mucketty mine just east of Muckaty Station.

The region is <a href="semi-arid">semi-arid</a>, and the vegetation is generally <a href="scrubland">scrubland</a>. Muckaty Station lies at the boundary of two bioregions, Tanami and Sturt Plateau. The Tanami bioregion is made up primarily of sandplains vegetated with bootlace oak ("<a href="Hakea%20lorea">Hakea lorea</a>"), desert bloodwoods ("<a href="Corymbia">Corymbia</a>" species), <a href="acacia">acacia</a>s and <a href="grevillea">grevillea</a>s, together with <a href="Triodia%20%28plant%20genus%29">spinifex grasslands</a>. The Sturt Plateau bioregion also includes spinifex grasslands, but with a <a href="canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> of bloodwood trees.

Most of the region's fauna is typical of desert environments. Species include the <a href="red%20kangaroo">red kangaroo</a>, the <a href="eastern%20wallaroo">eastern wallaroo</a> (also known as the euro), the <a href="northern%20nail-tail%20wallaby">northern nail-tail wallaby</a>, and the <a href="spinifex%20hopping%20mouse">spinifex hopping mouse</a>. The <a href="central%20pebble-mound%20mouse">central pebble-mound mouse</a> also occurs in the region, and other mammal species including the <a href="Forrest%27s%20mouse">Forrest's mouse</a>, <a href="desert%20mouse">desert mouse</a> and <a href="short-beaked%20echidna">short-beaked echidna</a> have been predicted by biologists to occur on the station. The station may lie within the range of the critically endangered <a href="night%20parrot">night parrot</a> ("Pezoporus occidentalis"). There is relatively high diversity and abundance of reptiles, including the military dragon ("<a href="Ctenophorus">Ctenophorus</a> isolepis gularis") and the <a href="sand%20goanna">sand goanna</a> ("Varanus gouldii flavirufus").

The search for a site at which to dispose of or store Australia's low and intermediate-level radioactive wastes commenced in 1980. A formal public process of site selection that had commenced in 1991 finally failed in 2004. On 7 December 2005, the <a href="Howard%20government">Australian government</a> passed legislation, the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act, to facilitate the siting of a radioactive waste facility in the Northern Territory. Section four of the Act allowed the Australian government to schedule potential sites for a waste facility, and three Northern Territory sites were proposed under the legislation. Following criticisms made by the Northern Land Council, in December 2006 the legislation was revised to also allow Aboriginal <a href="Land%20Council">Land Council</a>s to nominate potential sites for a facility. In May 2007 the Northern Land Council, on behalf of Ngapa clan traditional owners, nominated a small area within Muckaty Station (for which the Ngapa had traditional responsibility) to be considered as a possible site for the facility. In September 2007, the government accepted the nomination, bringing the total number of possible sites to four. The <a href="Government%20of%20the%20Northern%20Territory">Government of the Northern Territory</a> opposed the nomination, but could not prevent it. Ngapa clan members volunteered a area to be considered for the facility, which was expected to require 1 square kilometre of land.

A parliamentary inquiry and media reports indicated that the Indigenous traditional owners of Muckaty Station were divided over whether it should host a radioactive waste facility. Some members of the Ngapa clan supported hosting the facility, while other traditional owners of Muckaty opposed it. There were also claims that some members of the Ngapa clan were among those who had signed a petition opposing the facility. Political scientist Rebecca Stringer criticised the federal government's approach to the siting of the waste facility, arguing that it undermined the Indigenous owners' sovereignty and control of their own lands. Environmental organisations and the <a href="Australian%20Greens">Australian Greens</a> are opposed to using the site for a dump.

In 2009, the Australian government received a consultant's report that examined Muckaty Station as one of four possible sites for a nuclear waste facility in the Northern Territory. The report was released in 2010. In February 2012, the Muckaty Station site was the only one under consideration by the government.

In 2010, Mark Lane Jangala and other traditional owners instructed law firms <a href="Maurice%20Blackburn%20%28law%20firm%29">Maurice Blackburn</a>, Surry Partners (a firm that includes human rights lawyer <a href="George%20Newhouse">George Newhouse</a>), and lawyer <a href="Julian%20Burnside">Julian Burnside</a> to commence legal proceedings against the Northern Land Council and the Australian government in the <a href="Federal%20Court%20of%20Australia">Federal Court of Australia</a> to stop the nomination of Muckaty Station as a nuclear waste storage facility. The Federal Court challenge was due to commence early in 2013 before Justice Tony North, who handled the <a href="Tampa%20affair">Tampa affair</a>. According to a June 2012 report in "The Age", some indigenous owners would "testify they were never consulted, while others [will] say that they were not properly consulted and never consented to the nomination". The court did not begin hearing the case until 2 June 2014, for what was expected to be a five-week trial. However, on 18 June, the Northern Land Council withdrew the nomination of Muckaty as part of a legal settlement between the parties. The Australian government indicated there would be a three-month period during which the Northern Land Council and traditional owners could determine whether they wished to nominate an alternative site for the dump elsewhere on Muckaty Station.

The <a href="Libretto">librettist</a> included a quotation from the day's prescribed Gospel reading in the only <a href="recitative">recitative</a>, and for the closing <a href="chorale">chorale</a> he used a <a href="stanza">stanza</a> from <a href="Philipp%20Nicolai">Philipp Nicolai</a>'s <a href="hymn">hymn</a> "" (1599).

The work is in six <a href="Movement%20%28music%29">movements</a>, and scored for four vocal soloists, four-part choir, three <a href="trumpet">trumpet</a>s, <a href="timpani">timpani</a>, <a href="oboe">oboe</a>, <a href="bassoon">bassoon</a> and a string orchestra of two <a href="violin">violin</a>s, two <a href="viola">viola</a>s, and <a href="basso%20continuo">basso continuo</a>. The orchestra for the holiday occasion is festive compared to the two works previously composed in Weimar. The cantata opens with a chorus, followed by the recitative, in which words spoken by Jesus are sung by the <a href="Bass%20%28voice%20type%29">bass</a> as the (voice of Christ). A bass <a href="aria">aria</a> with trumpets addresses the <a href="Trinity%20%28Christianity%29">Trinity</a>, and a <a href="tenor">tenor</a> aria then describes the Spirit that was present at the <a href="Genesis%20creation%20narrative">Creation</a>. This is followed by an intimate <a href="duet">duet</a> of the Soul (<a href="soprano">soprano</a>) and the Spirit (<a href="alto">alto</a>), to which an oboe plays the ornamented melody of <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>'s hymn "" and a solo <a href="cello">cello</a> provides the bass line. The theme of intimacy between God and Man is developed further in the following chorale, after which Bach specified an unusual repeat of the opening chorus.

While Bach served as "<a href="Thomaskantor">Thomaskantor</a>" – director of church music – in Leipzig from 1723, he performed the cantata several times, sometimes in a different key and with changes in the scoring. Musicologists agree that he loved the cantata's Gospel text, "If ye love me ...", and the Pentecost hymn used in the duet, setting both the text and the hymn several times. <a href="John%20Eliot%20Gardiner">John Eliot Gardiner</a> writes that Bach "particularly valued" this cantata. It contains features that he used again in later compositions of cantatas, <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a>s and <a href="Missa%20%28Bach%29">his masses</a>, for example movements with three trumpets and timpani in a <a href="triple%20meter">triple meter</a> for festive occasions, and duets as a symbol of God and man.
Bach is known as a prolific composer of cantatas. When he assumed the position as "<a href="Thomaskantor">Thomaskantor</a>" (director of church music) in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a> in 1723, he began the project to write <a href="Church%20cantata%20%28Bach%29">church cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year</a> – Sundays and feast days – a project that he pursued for three years.

Bach was appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar at the court of the co-reigning dukes in <a href="Saxe-Weimar">Saxe-Weimar</a>, <a href="Wilhelm%20Ernst%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Weimar">Wilhelm Ernst</a> and his nephew <a href="Ernst%20August%20I%20of%20Saxe-Weimar">Ernst August</a> on 25 June 1708. He had composed sacred cantatas before, some during his tenure in <a href="M%C3%BChlhausen">Mühlhausen</a> from 1706 to 1708. Most were written for special occasions and were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns. Examples include: <a href="Aus%20der%20Tiefen%20rufe%20ich%2C%20Herr%2C%20zu%20dir%2C%20BWV%20131">"Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir", BWV 131</a>; the early <a href="Chorale%20cantata%20%28Bach%29">chorale cantata</a> <a href="Christ%20lag%20in%20Todes%20Banden%2C%20BWV%204">"Christ lag in Todes Banden", BWV 4</a> for Easter; <a href="Gott%20ist%20mein%20K%C3%B6nig%2C%20BWV%2071">"Gott ist mein König", BWV 71</a>, to celebrate the inauguration of the new city council on 4 February 1708; and the "<a href="Gottes%20Zeit%20ist%20die%20allerbeste%20Zeit%2C%20BWV%20106">Actus Tragicus</a>" for a funeral.
In Weimar, Bach first concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the , the <a href="Toccata%20and%20Fugue%20in%20D%20minor%2C%20BWV%20565">Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565</a>, and the <a href="Prelude%20%28Toccata%29%20and%20Fugue%20in%20E%20major%2C%20BWV%20566">Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566</a>. <a href="Christoph%20Wolff">Christoph Wolff</a> suggests that Bach may have studied musical material belonging to the , ("court capelle" or court orchestra), and that he copied and studied works by <a href="Johann%20Philipp%20Krieger">Johann Philipp Krieger</a>, <a href="Christoph%20Graupner">Christoph Graupner</a>, <a href="Georg%20Philipp%20Telemann">Georg Philipp Telemann</a>, <a href="Marco%20Giuseppe%20Peranda">Marco Giuseppe Peranda</a> and <a href="Johann%20David%20Heinichen">Johann David Heinichen</a> in the period from 1711 to 1713. In early 1713 Bach composed his first cantatas in the new style that included <a href="recitative">recitative</a>s and <a href="aria">aria</a>s: the so-called "<a href="Was%20mir%20behagt%2C%20ist%20nur%20die%20muntre%20Jagd%2C%20BWV%20208">Hunting Cantata</a>", BWV 208, as a homage cantata for <a href="Christian%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Weissenfels">Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels</a>, celebrated on 23 February, and possibly the church cantata for <a href="Sexagesima">Sexagesima</a> (the second Sunday before <a href="Lent">Lent</a>) , on a text by <a href="Erdmann%20Neumeister">Erdmann Neumeister</a>.

In 1713, he was asked to apply for the position of music director of the in <a href="Halle%20%28Saale%29">Halle</a>, succeeding <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Zachow">Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow</a>. Zachow had taught the young <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">George Frideric Handel</a>, and composed many church cantatas in the new style, adopting recitatives and arias from the <a href="Italian%20opera">Italian opera</a>. Bach was successful in his application for the position, but declined after Duke Wilhelm Ernst increased his salary and offered him a promotion.

Bach was promoted to on 2 March 1714, an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the : With the appointment, he received the title "Konzertmeister" and new privileges: Circumstances were favourable: Bach enjoyed a "congenial and intimate" space in the court chapel, called (Heaven's Castle), and a professional group of musicians in the court capelle. He was inspired by a collaboration with the court poet <a href="Salomon%20Franck">Salomon Franck</a>, who provided the texts for most of his church cantatas, capturing a "pure, straightforward theological message" in "elegant poetic language". The first two cantatas Bach composed in Weimar based on Franck's texts were , for <a href="Palm%20Sunday">Palm Sunday</a>, which coincided with the <a href="Annunciation">Annunciation</a> that year, and for <a href="Jubilate%20Sunday">Jubilate Sunday</a>. One month after "Erschallet, ihr Lieder", Bach performed <a href="Ich%20hatte%20viel%20Bek%C3%BCmmernis%2C%20BWV%2021">"Ich hatte viel Bekümmernis", BWV 21</a>, on the third Sunday after <a href="Trinity%20Sunday">Trinity</a>, again on a text by Franck. "Erschallet, ihr Lieder", the third cantata in this series, is the first cantata for a feast day.

 is the third of the <a href="Weimar%20cantata%20%28Bach%29">Weimar cantatas</a>. It was the first composed for a feast day, <a href="Church%20cantata%23Pentecost">Pentecost Sunday</a> (Whit Sunday), <a href="Pentecost">Pentecost</a> being a high holiday along with Christmas and Easter. The prescribed readings for the feast day are taken from the <a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>, on the <a href="Holy%20Spirit%20%28Christianity%29">Holy Spirit</a> (), and from the <a href="Gospel%20of%20John">Gospel of John</a>, in which Jesus announces the Spirit who will teach, in his <a href="Farewell%20discourse">Farewell discourse</a> (). As in many <a href="Bach%20cantata">Bach cantata</a>s, the <a href="libretto">libretto</a> is compiled from Bible text, contemporary poetry and chorale. The poetry is attributed to Salomon Franck, although the verses are not included in his printed editions. Several of Bach's early stylistic mannerisms appear here, such as a biblical quotation in a recitative second movement rather than in a first choral movement, arias following each other without a recitative in between, and dialogue in a duet.

Franck's text shows elements of early <a href="Pietism">Pietism</a>: the expression of extreme feelings, for example "O seligste Zeiten!" (O most blessed times) in the opening chorus, and a "mystical demeanour", for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united. In the middle section of the first movement, Franck paraphrases the Gospel text, which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man, to "" (God Himself shall prepare our souls for His temple, more literally: "God wants to prepare [our] souls to become his temples"). The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, "" (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the <a href="Trinity%20%28Christianity%29">Trinity</a> and movement 4 the Spirit that was present at the <a href="Genesis%20creation%20narrative">Creation</a>. Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental quote from <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>'s Pentecost hymn "", which is based on the Latin hymn "<a href="Come%2C%20Holy%20Spirit">Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium</a>". Movement 6 is a <a href="chorale">chorale</a>, verse four of <a href="Philipp%20Nicolai">Philipp Nicolai</a>'s hymn "". Nicolai's "Geistlich Brautlied" (Spiritual bridal song) continues the theme of unity between Soul and Spirit.

With Bach's appointment to concert master and his regular monthly cantata compositions, he achieved permission to hold rehearsals in the church, to ensure high performance standards: "the rehearsing of the pieces at the home [of the capellmeister] has been changed, and it is ordered that it must always take place at the [the music gallery in the palace church], and this is also to be observed by the ". The orchestra at his disposition consisted of the members of the court cappelle, three leaders, five singers and seven instrumentalists, augmented on demand by military musicians, town musicians and choristers from a gymnasium.

Bach conducted the first performance of on 20 May 1714. His son <a href="Carl%20Philipp%20Emanuel%20Bach">Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach</a> remembered that he often conducted and played first violin: "he played the violin cleanly and penetratingly, and thus kept the orchestra in better order than he could have done with the harpsichord". The parts for the first performance are lost, but the score and performing material for later performances have survived. Bach performed the cantata again, possibly in Köthen between 1717 and 1722, and several times as in Leipzig. For the performance on 28 May 1724, he changed the instrumentation slightly and transposed the work from <a href="C%20major">C major</a> to <a href="D%20major">D major</a>. He reverted to C major for a performance on 13 May 1731. An organ part for a later performance of movement 5 is extant.

John Eliot Gardiner remarked that Bach "particularly valued" this cantata, and that it set "a pattern for his later approaches to the Pentecostal theme". Bach set the Gospel text of the recitative in a choral movement in other cantatas for Pentecost – , and .

In the Weimar version, Bach scored the cantata four vocal soloists (<a href="soprano">soprano</a> (S), <a href="alto">alto</a> (A), <a href="tenor">tenor</a> (T) and <a href="Bass%20%28voice%20type%29">bass</a>) (B), a <a href="SATB">four-part choir</a>, and an orchestra of three <a href="trumpet">trumpet</a>s (Tr), <a href="timpani">timpani</a> (Ti), <a href="Recorder%20%28musical%20instrument%29">recorder</a> (Fl) or <a href="flauto%20traverso">flauto traverso</a> (Ft), <a href="oboe%20d%27amore">oboe d'amore</a> (Oa), two <a href="violin">violin</a>s (Vl), two <a href="viola">viola</a>s (Va), <a href="bassoon">bassoon</a> (Fg), <a href="cello">cello</a> (Vc), and <a href="basso%20continuo">basso continuo</a> (Bc). It is a festive, rich instrumentation for the holiday, whereas the previous two cantatas in Weimar had not employed brass instruments. Bach used the French string orchestra with two viola parts, as in most cantatas until 1715, when he started to prefer the Italian scoring with one viola. In Weimar, a recorder or flauto traverso doubled the first violin an octave higher; in the first Leipzig performance it was a flauto traverso. A part for <a href="obbligato">obbligato</a> <a href="Organ%20%28music%29">organ</a> (Org) replacing oboe and cello in movement 5 was adopted in an even later performance. The work is about 25 minutes long. In the Weimar version and the 1724 version, Bach requested a repeat of the opening chorus, by adding after the chorale .

In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Weimar version of the <a href="Neue%20Bach-Ausgabe">Neue Bach-Ausgabe</a>, and the abbreviations for voices and instruments the <a href="List%20of%20Bach%20cantatas%23Abbreviations">list of Bach cantatas</a>. The <a href="Key%20%28music%29">keys</a> are given for the Weimar version. The <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a> is provided using the symbol for common time (4/4).

The cantata text does not tell a story but reflects different aspects of the Holy Spirit, celebrated on Pentecost. It begins with general praise, then concentrates on one line from the Gospel, addresses the <a href="Trinity">Holy Trinity</a>, refers to the Spirit that was present at the Creation, shows a dialogue between the Soul and the Spirit, and concludes with a <a href="stanza">stanza</a> from Nicolai's hymn which picks up the topic of unity between God (Spirit) and man, as shown in the dialogue. The text thus proceeds from general to more and more personal and intimate reflection.

John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted all Bach's church cantatas in 2000, placed the Pentecostal cantatas in the middle of the project, which he saw as a "year-long exploration of his cantatas in their seasonal context". He described Pentecost as "the culmination of those 'great fifty days' which follow the Resurrection, a watershed marking the completion of Jesus' work on earth and the coming of the Holy Spirit", and commented that Bach "comes up with music of unalloyed optimism and exuberance in celebration of ... the miraculous ignition of the divine Pentecostal spark which allows human beings to communicate across the language barrier". Regarding , the first cantata written for the occasion, he observed that Bach reflects the "stages in the evolving relationship of God with man", both by scoring and by his choice of keys. In the Weimar first version, the key of the first movements is C major, lowered to A minor (a third lower) in the fourth, lowered further to F major (again a third lower) in the fifth and sixth. The scoring is majestic, with three trumpets and timpani in movement 1 and three trumpets again in movement 3, reduced to strings in movement 4 and to single instruments in movement 5.

"" (literally: sound, you songs) is a festive <a href="Concerto%23Early%20Baroque%20concerto">concerto</a>, marked by Bach. Words and music are possibly based on an earlier lost secular (congratulatory cantata). A printing of Franck's works contains a cantata for <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Day">New Year's Day</a>, (Sound again, congratulating songs) that may have served as a model. The movement is in "<a href="da%20capo">da capo</a>" form: the first section is repeated after a contrasting middle section. It is scored for three "choirs": one of trumpets, another of strings and bassoon, and a four-part chorus. The number three, symbolizing the Trinity, appears again in the 3/8 time signature and in the use of three trumpets. The first part opens with trumpet fanfares, alternating with flowing <a href="coloratura">coloratura</a>s in the strings. The voices enter as a third <a href="Homophony">homophonic</a> choir. They repeat the first measure of the fanfare motif on the word "Erschallet" (resound!), as the trumpets echo the motif. The voices repeat the motif from the second measure of the fanfare on "ihr Lieder", and the trumpets echo it again. The chorus repeats measures 3 and 4 on "erklinget, ihr Saiten", commanding the strings to play. As a culmination, the first syllable of "" (most blessed times) is held on a <a href="seventh%20chord">seventh chord</a> (first in measure 53), during which the instruments play their motifs.

In the middle section in A minor the trumpets rest while the other instruments play with the voices. <a href="Polyphony">Polyphonic</a> imitation expands on the idea that God will prepare the souls to be his temples. The first sequence progresses from the lowest to the highest voice, with entrances after two or three measures. The highest voice begins the second sequence, and the other voices enter in closer succession, one or two measures apart. Gardiner interprets the polyphony as "conjuring before us the elegant tracery of those 'temples' which God promises to make of our souls". The first part is repeated as da capo.

The movement is comparable to the opening of <a href="T%C3%B6net%2C%20ihr%20Pauken%21%20Erschallet%2C%20Trompeten%21%20BWV%20214">"Tönet, ihr Pauken! Erschallet, Trompeten!" BWV 214</a> (Resound, ye drums! Ring out, ye trumpets!) composed in 1733 on another text calling instruments to sound, which Bach later used with a different text to open his "<a href="Christmas%20Oratorio">Christmas Oratorio</a>". Bach used a festive scoring with three trumpets in triple meter in his 1733 for the court in Dresden, in the "<a href="Mass%20in%20B%20minor%20structure%23Gloria">Gloria</a>", in contrast to the preceding "<a href="Mass%20in%20B%20minor%20structure%23Kyrie%20I">Kyrie</a>".

The cantata's only recitative quotes one line from the Gospel reading of the day: "" (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word[, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him]). Bach reflects Jesus' promise to "make Our dwelling with him" in <a href="melisma">melisma</a>tic lines in counterpoint with <a href="Motif%20%28music%29">motifs</a> in the cello similar to motifs in movement 5. He assigned the words of Jesus to the bass as the (voice of Christ). He illustrates the final rest in God by ending the solo line on a whole note low C, the lowest note he demanded of a soloist. The musicologist Julian Mincham describes the vocal line:
The initial bars of melody are warm and quietly authoritative, but at the mention of dwelling with Him the movement takes on a very different character. The bass line becomes enlivened with little leaps of delight ... The singer's last note is a bottom d (c in the transposed version) several notes lower than a bass's accepted range. ... when achieved it is an arresting sound, confirming the rock-like certainty of the promise that we shall eventually reside with God.

The first aria, addressing the Trinity, "" (Holiest Trinity), is accompanied by a choir of three trumpets and basso continuo, a rare combination that expresses the idea of the words. The trumpet is a symbol of a ruler. The three trumpets sometimes play in unison, to further illustrate the Trinity. The theme is composed of the three notes of the <a href="major%20chord">major chord</a>. The aria is in three sections.

Bach wrote an aria accompanied by only an obbligato brass instrument again in his (Kyrie and Gloria) in B minor, composed in 1733 for the court in Dresden and much later integrated into his <a href="Mass%20in%20B%20minor%20structure">Mass in B minor</a>. The bass aria "<a href="Mass%20in%20B%20minor%20structure%23Quoniam%20tu%20solus%20sanctus">Quoniam tu solus sanctus</a>", reflecting God's holiness and majesty, is set for <a href="corno%20da%20caccia">corno da caccia</a>, two bassoons and basso continuo. When he assembled the complete mass, he used an aria with only woodwinds to reflect the Holy Spirit in "<a href="Mass%20in%20B%20minor%20structure%23Et%20in%20Spiritum%20Sanctum">Et in Spiritum Sanctum</a>", also a movement with many symbols of the Trinity.

The second aria, for tenor, "" (O paradise of the soul), also contains three sections and a <a href="triple%20metre">triple meter</a>, but in contrast to the previous movement, describes in continuous waves of the <a href="unison">unison</a> strings the Spirit that was present at the Creation, worded (O paradise of the soul, fanned by the Spirit of God, which blew at creation). <a href="Alfred%20D%C3%BCrr">Alfred Dürr</a> wrote that the music "conveys the impression of release from all earthly gravity".

The last solo movement, titled "Aria", "" (Come, do not keep me waiting longer), consists of a dialogue between the Soul and the Holy Spirit, and takes a form close to a love lyric. The part of the Spirit is assigned to the alto, while similar duets of the Soul and Jesus in later cantatas are set for soprano and bass – for example in <a href="Ich%20hatte%20viel%20Bek%C3%BCmmernis%2C%20BWV%2021">"Ich hatte viel Bekümmernis", BWV 21</a> and <a href="Wachet%20auf%2C%20ruft%20uns%20die%20Stimme%2C%20BWV%20140">"Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme", BWV 140</a>.
Bach set the text in a complex structure uniting two singers, a solo oboe and a solo cello. The soprano and alto sing of their unity in "neo-erotic" or "overtly erotic/Pietistic" language: "I shall die, if I have to be without you" the one; "I am yours, and you are mine!" the other. The cello provides an intricate counterpoint throughout, which <a href="Albert%20Schweitzer">Albert Schweitzer</a> describes as "a motif of purified happiness". The voices and the cello form a trio, another symbol of the Trinity. The musicologist Anne Leahy of the <a href="Dublin%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Dublin Institute of Technology</a> notes that Bach had possibly stanza 3 in mind, which speaks of love, and used the instrument which is named after love.

The oboe d'amore plays the richly ornamented melody of the Pentecost hymn "" ("Come, Holy Spirit, Lord God, fill with the goodness of Your grace the hearts, wills, and minds of Your faithful. Ignite Your burning love in them".) Bach set this hymn, which seems close to his heart, twice in his <a href="Great%20Eighteen%20Chorale%20Preludes">Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes</a>, as <a href="Great%20Eighteen%20Chorale%20Preludes%23Chorale%20Preludes%20BWV%20651%E2%80%93668">BWV 651</a> and BWV 652.

Bach used duets again when he composed in 1733 his (Kyrie and Gloria) in B minor for the court in Dresden, which he later integrated into his Mass in B minor. He wrote two duets movements in the style of contemporary operatic love duets and placed two of them in the centre of each part of the Missa: "<a href="Mass%20in%20B%20minor%20structure%23Christe">Christe eleison</a>" for two sopranos in the centre of the Kyrie, in the centre of the symmetrical structure of the Gloria. When he compiled the Mass in B minor, he chose another duet for the Credo, scored for soprano and alto, as in "Erschallet, ihr Lieder".

The text of the concluding chorale is taken from Nicolai's "Geistlich Brautlied" (Spiritual bridal song) "<a href="Wie%20sch%C3%B6n%20leuchtet%20der%20Morgenstern">Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern</a>", continuing the theme of unity between Soul and Spirit. "" (A joyful radiance reaches me from God) is illustrated by a violin part added to the four-part choir. The text ends with the words:

Until 1724 the opening chorus was repeated after the chorale, marked "chorus repetatur ab initio" in the manuscript.

Gardiner describes the cantata as "evidently ... a work which he particularly valued", adding: "he comes up with music of unalloyed optimism and exuberance in celebration of the first gifts of newly-awakened nature, as well as the miraculous ignition of the divine Pentecostal spark which allows human beings to communicate across the language barrier." Dürr comments: 

The cantata was published by <a href="Breitkopf%20%26amp%3B%20H%C3%A4rtel">Breitkopf & Härtel</a> in 1888 in volume 35 of the first complete edition of Bach's works by the <a href="Bach%20Gesellschaft">Bach Gesellschaft</a>, edited by <a href="Alfred%20D%C3%B6rffel">Alfred Dörffel</a>. In the <a href="Neue%20Bach-Ausgabe">Neue Bach-Ausgabe</a>, the second complete edition of Bach's works, in the historical-critical edition, <a href="Dietrich%20Kilian">Dietrich Kilian</a> edited both the reconstructed Weimar version (1959) and the first Leipzig version (1960) in volume 13, adding the critical report in 1960.

<doc id="26590175" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26590175" title="Nebula Science Fiction">
Nebula Science Fiction

Nebula Science Fiction was the first Scottish <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction</a> magazine. It was published from 1952 to 1959, and was edited by Peter Hamilton, a young Scot who was able to take advantage of spare capacity at his parents' printing company, Crownpoint, to launch the magazine. Because Hamilton could only print "Nebula" when Crownpoint had no other work, the schedule was initially erratic. In 1955 he moved the printing to a Dublin-based firm, and the schedule became a little more regular, with a steady monthly run beginning in 1958 that lasted into the following year. "Nebula"s circulation was international, with only a quarter of the sales in the United Kingdom (UK); this led to disaster when South Africa and Australia imposed import controls on foreign periodicals at the end of the 1950s. <a href="Excise">Excise</a> duties imposed in the UK added to Hamilton's financial burdens, and he was rapidly forced to close the magazine. The last issue was dated June 1959.

The magazine was popular with writers, partly because Hamilton went to great lengths to encourage new writers, and partly because he paid better rates per word than much of his competition. Initially he could not compete with the American market, but he offered a bonus for the most popular story in the issue, and was eventually able to match the leading American magazines. He published the first stories of several well-known writers, including <a href="Robert%20Silverberg">Robert Silverberg</a>, <a href="Brian%20Aldiss">Brian Aldiss</a>, and <a href="Bob%20Shaw">Bob Shaw</a>. "Nebula" was also a fan favourite: author <a href="Ken%20Bulmer">Ken Bulmer</a> recalled that it became "what many fans regard as the best-loved British SF magazine".

In 1952 Peter Hamilton was 18 years old and had just left school; he was looking for a job, but was not healthy enough for hard physical work. His parents ran a printing house in <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, Crownpoint Publications, and occasionally had spare capacity: they were interested in using the idle time on their machinery to enter the publishing business, and Peter persuaded them to publish paperback science fiction (sf) novels. Two novels were acquired, but when Crownpoint approached a local wholesaler to handle the distribution, they were told that paperbacks would be a mistake, and that a magazine, with a regular publication schedule, would be more likely to sell well. The result was "Nebula Science Fiction". The first issue was dated Autumn 1952, and sold 4,000 copies.

Advertisements stated that "Nebula" was "Scotland's first S.F. magazine!!" Several British <a href="science%20fiction%20fandom">science fiction fans</a> helped Hamilton with the production of the magazine, including <a href="Ken%20Slater%20%28science%20fiction%29">Ken Slater</a>, <a href="Vin%C2%A2%20Clarke">Vin¢ Clarke</a>, and <a href="John%20Brunner%20%28novelist%29">John Brunner</a>. <a href="William%20F.%20Temple">William F. Temple</a> was involved as an editorial consultant and also assisted with editing the manuscripts. Hamilton provided all the financing, but he had to wait for the money to come in from each issue before he could afford to produce the next. In addition, Crownpoint only intermittently had enough spare capacity to print "Nebula", so the first few issues appeared on an erratic schedule. After a dozen issues, the conflicts led to Hamilton moving "Nebula" to a printing firm based in Dublin, and breaking the connection with Crownpoint. He was then able to publish on a slightly more regular schedule, although the planned bi-monthly issues were still sometimes delayed. Hamilton paid 21 <a href="%C2%A3sd">shillings</a> (£1.05) per thousand words, the equivalent of three tenths of a cent per word; this was a low rate compared to the American market, but was marginally better than the contemporary British magazine "<a href="Authentic%20Science%20Fiction">Authentic Science Fiction</a>", which paid £1 per thousand words. Hamilton offered a bonus of £2 or £5 to the story that turned out to be the readers' favourite in each issue, which helped attract writers; and he later increased the rates, paying as much as 2d (0.8p, or 2.3 cents) per word for well-known authors. This was higher than the best UK markets, such as "<a href="New%20Worlds%20%28magazine%29">New Worlds</a>", and was close to the rates paid by the top magazines in the US at that time. Both the high rates of pay and Hamilton's willingness to work with new authors were designed to encourage writers to submit their work to "Nebula" before trying the other magazines.

Hamilton's editorial in the September 1957 issue reported a circulation of 40,000, and starting in January 1958 "Nebula" went on a regular monthly schedule that was maintained until early 1959. Although "Nebula"s circulation was strong, only about a quarter of its sales were in the UK. A further quarter of the sales were in Australia, another third in the US, and nearly a tenth in South Africa. At the end of the 1950s, first South Africa and then Australia began to limit foreign magazine imports, for economic reasons, and when this was followed by UK <a href="excise">excise</a> duties the magazine was quickly in debt. Hamilton was forced to cease publication with issue 41, dated June 1959. Hamilton had also had health problems which contributed to his decision to stop publication.

The first two issues of "Nebula" contained the two novels Hamilton had bought before changing his plans from a paperback series to a magazine: "Robots Never Weep" by <a href="E.R.%20James">E.R. James</a>, and "Thou Pasture Us" by <a href="F.G.%20Rayer">F.G. Rayer</a>. These left little room for other material, but Hamilton was able to reprint a short story by <a href="A.%20E.%20van%20Vogt">A. E. van Vogt</a> in the first issue, and stories by John Brunner and <a href="E.%20C.%20Tubb">E. C. Tubb</a> in the second issue, along with material by lesser known writers. There was also a column by <a href="Walt%20Willis">Walt Willis</a> called "The Electric Fan", later renamed "Fanorama", which covered <a href="science%20fiction%20fandom">science fiction fandom</a>.

Many of the better-known British writers began to appear in "Nebula", including William F. Temple and <a href="Eric%20Frank%20Russell">Eric Frank Russell</a>; new authors also began to be published. Hamilton was glad to work with beginning writers, and in 1953 several writers who later became very well known, including <a href="Brian%20Aldiss">Brian Aldiss</a>, <a href="Barrington%20Bayley">Barrington Bayley</a>, and <a href="Bob%20Shaw">Bob Shaw</a>, each sold their first story to "Nebula". Not all these stories reached print that year: Aldiss's "T" appeared in the November 1956 issue, by which time other stories of Aldiss's were in print, and the first story by Bayley is not certainly identified – it may have been "Consolidation", which appeared in November 1959, but it is also possible that it was never printed. <a href="Robert%20Silverberg">Robert Silverberg</a> had begun submitting stories to Hamilton as soon as he heard of "Nebula", realizing that Hamilton was unlikely to be getting many submissions from US writers, and found Hamilton very helpful. Silverberg's first story, "Gorgon Planet", was accepted by Hamilton on January 11, 1954. Brian Aldiss echoes Silverberg's assessment of Hamilton, commenting that Hamilton was "a sympathetic editor to a beginner. He was also a patient editor."

Other authors who appeared in "Nebula" early in their careers included <a href="Harlan%20Ellison">Harlan Ellison</a>, <a href="John%20T.%20Phillifent">John Rackham</a>, and <a href="James%20White%20%28author%29">James White</a>. Science fiction historian <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a> regards the stories Hamilton selected as demonstrating a "wide range of material by excellent writers" that was "seldom predictable", but adds that the stories have become dated, with the result that few are now well-known. Among a short list of exceptions Ashley includes Brian Aldiss's "Legends of Smith’s Burst" and "Dumb Show". Because of the erratic schedule, Hamilton only serialised one novel: "Wisdom of the Gods", by <a href="Ken%20Bulmer">Ken Bulmer</a>, which appeared in four parts, starting in the July 1958 issue. Hamilton was planning to serialise a novel by <a href="Robert%20Heinlein">Robert Heinlein</a> when the magazine ceased publication.

Cover art came from artists such as Gerard Quinn, and included some of <a href="Eddie%20Jones%20%28artist%29">Eddie Jones</a>' earliest work. According to sf historian Philip Harbottle, the best of the Scottish artists that Hamilton worked with was <a href="James%20Stark%20%28artist%29">James Stark</a>, who painted nine covers for "Nebula" between 1956 and 1958; sf artist and art historian <a href="David%20A.%20Hardy">David Hardy</a> describes Stark's work as "severe portrayals of technology against which men were mere ants". Interior artists included <a href="Harry%20Turner%20%28artist%29">Harry Turner</a>, whose work is described by Harbottle as "visually striking" and "semi-impressionistic". From the October 1954 issue the back cover was given over to black and white artwork, often drawn by <a href="Arthur%20Thomson%20%28fanzines%29">Arthur Thomson</a>. Author Ken Bulmer regards these back covers as having given the magazine a "tremendously individual flavor".

"Nebula" became an established part of the British science fiction scene in the 1950s. The magazine was well-liked by writers, and Bulmer recalls that, overall, "Nebula" "created a special kind of charisma that, in the view of many writers and readers, no other magazine ever had", and adds that it became "what many fans regard as the best-loved British SF magazine". Tubb, who sold many popular stories to Hamilton, comments that "Authors wrote for "Nebula" with financial reward taking secondary place; the desire of submitting a good story being of primary importance ... the writers and the contributors felt as if "Nebula" was 'their' magazine, and all that became a happy, well-integrated family."

The publisher was Crownpoint Publications for the first twelve issues, though the name was dropped from the <a href="indicia%20%28publishing%29">indicia</a> starting with the December 1953 issue. From September 1955 the publisher was Peter Hamilton, who was editor throughout. The price was <a href="%C2%A3sd">2/-</a> (10p) for all but the last two issues, which were priced at 2/6 (12.5p).

"Nebula" was printed in large digest format, . The first three issues were 120 pages; this increased to 128 pages for the next three issues, to 130 pages for issue 7, and to 136 pages for issue 8. Issues 9 through 12 were 128 pages, and the remaining issues were 112 pages. The issues were numbered consecutively throughout; the first eight issues were given volume numberings as well, with two volumes of four numbers each.

Issues 30 through 39 of "Nebula" were distributed in the US; they were stamped at 35 cents and post-dated four months, thus the American copies ran from September 1958 to June 1959.

Adenanthos cuneatus

Adenanthos cuneatus, also known as coastal jugflower, flame bush, bridle bush and sweat bush, is a shrub of the family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a> native to the <a href="south%20coast%20of%20Western%20Australia">south coast of Western Australia</a>. The French naturalist <a href="Jacques%20Labillardi%C3%A8re">Jacques Labillardière</a> originally described it in 1805. Within the genus "<a href="Adenanthos">Adenanthos</a>", it lies in the <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">section</a> "<a href="Adenanthos%20sect.%20Adenanthos">Adenanthos</a>" and is most closely related to "<a href="Adenanthos%20stictus">A. stictus</a>". "A. cuneatus" has hybridized with four other species of "Adenanthos". Growing to high and wide, it is erect to prostrate in <a href="Habit%20%28biology%29">habit</a>, with wedge-shaped lobed leaves covered in fine silvery hair. The single red flowers are insignificant, and appear all year, though especially in late spring. The reddish new growth occurs over the summer.

It is sensitive to "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>" <a href="Root%20rot">dieback</a>, hence requiring a sandy soil and good drainage to grow in cultivation, its natural habitat of sandy soils in <a href="heath">heath</a>land being an example. Its pollinators include bees, <a href="honey%20possum">honey possum</a>, <a href="silvereye">silvereye</a> and <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>s, particularly the <a href="western%20spinebill">western spinebill</a>. "A. cuneatus" is grown in gardens in Australia and the western United States, and a dwarf and prostrate form are commercially available.

"Adenanthos cuneatus" grows as an erect, spreading or prostrate shrub to high and wide. It has a woody base, known as a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>, from which it can resprout after bushfire. The wedge-shaped (<a href="cuneate%20leaf">cuneate</a>) leaves are on short <a href="Petiole%20%28botany%29">petioles</a>, and are long and wide, with 3 to 5 (and occasionally up to 7) rounded 'teeth' or lobes at the ends. New growth is red and slightly <a href="Transparency%20and%20translucency">translucent</a>. It glows bright red against the light, especially when the sun is low in the sky. New growth is mainly seen in summer, and the leaves in general are covered with fine, silvery hair. Occurring throughout the year but more often from August to November, the insignificant single flowers are a dull red in colour and measure around long. The pollen is triangular in shape and measures in length, averaging around .

The species is similar in many ways to its close relative "<a href="Adenanthos%20stictus">A. stictus</a>". The most obvious difference is in <a href="Habit%20%28biology%29">habit</a>: the multi-stemmed, lignotuberous "A. cuneatus" rarely grows over in height, whereas "A. stictus" is a taller single-stemmed non-lignotuberous shrub that commonly reaches in height. Leaves are similar, but the lobes at the leaf apex are regular and <a href="crenate">crenate</a> (rounded) in "A. cuneatus", but irregular and <a href="leaf%23Margins%20.28edge.29">dentate</a> (toothed) in "A. stictus". Also, new growth does not have a red flush in "A. stictus", and juvenile leaves of "A. stictus" are usually much larger than adult leaves, a difference not seen in "A. cuneatus". The flowers of the two species are very similar, differing only subtly in dimension, colour and <a href="indumentum">indumentum</a>.

Although the precise time and location of its discovery are unknown, <a href="Jacques%20Labillardi%C3%A8re">Jacques Labillardière</a>, botanist to an expedition under <a href="Bruni%20d%27Entrecasteaux">Bruni d'Entrecasteaux</a>, which anchored in <a href="Esperance%20Bay">Esperance Bay</a> on the south coast of Western Australia on 9 December 1792, most likely collected the first known botanical specimen of "Adenanthos cuneatus" on 16 December while searching the area between <a href="Observatory%20Point">Observatory Point</a> and <a href="Pink%20Lake%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Pink Lake</a> for the <a href="zoologist">zoologist</a> <a href="Claude%20Riche">Claude Riche</a>, who had gone ashore two days earlier and failed to return. Following an unsuccessful search the following day, several senior members of the expedition were convinced that Riche must have perished of thirst or at the hands of the <a href="Australian%20Aborigine">Australian Aborigine</a>s and counselled d'Entrecasteaux to sail without him. However, Labillardière convinced d'Entrecasteaux to search for another day, and was rewarded not only with the recovery of Riche, but also with the collection of several highly significant botanical specimens, including the first specimens of "<a href="Anigozanthos">Anigozanthos</a>" (Kangaroo Paw) and "<a href="Nuytsia%20floribunda">Nuytsia floribunda</a>" (West Australian Christmas Tree) and, as aforementioned, "A. cuneatus".

Thirteen years passed before Labillardière published a formal description of "A. cuneatus", and in the meantime several further collections were made: Scottish botanist <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> collected a specimen on 30 December 1801, during the visit of <a href="HMS%20Investigator%20%281798%29">HMS "Investigator"</a> to <a href="King%20George%20Sound">King George Sound</a>; and, fourteen months later, <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Leschenault%20de%20La%20Tour">Jean-Baptiste Leschenault de La Tour</a>, botanist to <a href="Nicolas%20Baudin">Nicolas Baudin</a>'s voyage of exploration, and "gardener's boy" <a href="Antoine%20Guichenot">Antoine Guichenot</a> collected more specimens therein. The official account of Baudin's expedition contain notes from Leschenault on vegetation:
Labillardière eventually published the genus "Adenanthos", along with "A. cuneatus" and two other species, in his 1805 "<a href="Novae%20Hollandiae%20Plantarum%20Specimen">Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen</a>". He chose the specific name "cuneata" in reference to the leaves of this species, which are <a href="cuneate%20leaf">cuneate</a> (triangular). This name has <a href="feminine%20gender">feminine gender</a>, consistent with the gender assigned by Labillardière to the genus. He did not designate which of the three published species was to serve as the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of "Adenanthos", but Irish botanist <a href="Ernest%20Charles%20Nelson">E. Charles Nelson</a> has since chosen "A. cuneatus" as <a href="lectotype">lectotype</a> for the genus, since the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> of "A. cuneatus" bears an annotation showing the derivation of the genus name, and because Labillardière's description of it is the most detailed of the three, and is referred to by the other descriptions.

In 1809, <a href="Richard%20Salisbury">Richard Salisbury</a>, writing under <a href="Joseph%20Knight%20%28horticulturist%29">Joseph Knight</a>'s name in the controversial "<a href="On%20the%20cultivation%20of%20the%20plants%20belonging%20to%20the%20natural%20order%20of%20Proteeae">On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae</a>", published the name "Adenanthes" "flabellifolia", listing "A. cuneata" as a synonym. As no <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> was given, and no specimen annotated by Knight could be found, this was treated as a <a href="nomenclatural%20synonym">nomenclatural synonym</a> of "A. cuneata" and was therefore rejected on the <a href="Priority%20%28nomenclature%29">principle of priority</a>.

Also synonymised with this species is "Adenanthos crenata", published by <a href="Carl%20Ludwig%20Willdenow">Carl Ludwig Willdenow</a>'s in <a href="Kurt%20Polycarp%20Joachim%20Sprengel">Kurt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel</a>'s 1825 16th edition of "<a href="Systema%20Vegetabilium">Systema Vegetabilium</a>". Willdenow published both "A. cuneata" and "A. crenata", giving them different descriptions but designating the same type specimen for both. Thus "A. crenata" was rejected under the principle of priority, and is now regarded as a nomenclatural synonym of "A. cuneatus".

In 1870, <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> published the first <a href="wikt%3Ainfrageneric">infrageneric</a> arrangement of "Adenanthos" in Volume 5 of his landmark ""<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>"". He divided the genus into two <a href="taxonomic%20section">section</a>s, placing "A. cuneata" in <a href="Adenanthos%20sect.%20Stenolaema">"A." sect. "Stenolaema"</a> because its perianth tube is straight and not swollen above the middle. This arrangement still stands today, though "A." sect. "Stenolaema" is now renamed to the <a href="autonym%20%28botany%29">autonym</a> <a href="Adenanthos%20sect.%20Adenanthos">"A." sect. "Adenanthos"</a>.

A <a href="phenetic">phenetic</a> analysis of the genus undertaken by Nelson in 1975 yielded results in which "A. cuneatus" was grouped with "A. stictus". This pairing was then neighbour to a larger group that included "<a href="Adenanthos%20forrestii">A. forrestii</a>", "<a href="Adenanthos%20eyrei">A. eyrei</a>", "<a href="Adenanthos%20cacomorphus">A. cacomorphus</a>", "<a href="Adenanthos%20ileticos">A. ileticos</a>", and several hybrid and unusual forms of "A. cuneatus". Nelson's analysis supported Bentham's sections, and so they were retained when Nelson published <a href="Nelson%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Adenanthos">a taxonomic revision of the genus</a> in 1978. He further subdivided "A." sect. "Adenanthos" into two subsections, with "A. cuneata" placed into <a href="Adenanthos%20subsect.%20Adenanthos">"A." subsect. "Adenanthos"</a> for reasons including the length of its perianth, but Nelson discarded his own subsections in his 1995 treatment of "Adenanthos", for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" series of monographs. By this time, the <a href="ICBN">ICBN</a> had issued a ruling that all genera ending in "-anthos" must be treated as having masculine gender; thus the specific epithet became "cuneatus".

The placement of "A. cuneatus" in <a href="Nelson%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Adenanthos">Nelson's arrangement of "Adenanthos"</a> may be summarised as follows:

"Adenanthos cuneatus" apparently forms hybrids with other "Adenanthos" species quite readily, as four putative natural hybrids have been reported:

This species has several common names, some highly localised. Two names allude to its consumption by horses; "bridle bush", a name used east of <a href="Esperance%2C%20Western%20Australia">Esperance</a>, refers to the fact that horses favour it as <a href="fodder">fodder</a>; and "sweat bush", used around <a href="Hopetoun%2C%20Western%20Australia">Hopetoun</a>, derived from the claim that horses break out in <a href="sweat">sweat</a> after consuming young growth. The common name of "flame bush" derives from the brilliant red new growth. It is also known as "coastal jugflower". Nelson also records the use of the names "Templetonia" and "native temp", but ridicules them as obvious errors.

The most widely distributed "Adenanthos" species of the south coast, "A. cuneatus" is common and locally abundant between <a href="King%20George%20Sound">King George Sound</a> and <a href="Israelite%20Bay">Israelite Bay</a>, along the coast and up to inland, with isolated populations extending west to <a href="Walpole%2C%20Western%20Australia">Walpole</a> and the <a href="Stirling%20Range">Stirling Range</a>, and as far east of Israelite Bay as <a href="Twilight%20Cove">Twilight Cove</a>.

This species is restricted to <a href="siliceous">siliceous</a> sandplain soils and will not grow in <a href="calcareous">calcareous</a> soils such as the <a href="limestone">limestone</a> plains of the <a href="Nullarbor">Nullarbor</a>, or even siliceous dunes with limestone at little depth. This restriction explains the disjunctions east of Israelite Bay: the species occurs only in those few locations where the existence of <a href="cliff-top%20dune">cliff-top dune</a>s of deep siliceous sand provide suitable habitat. Provided the soil is siliceous and fairly dry, "A. cuneatus" tolerates a range of <a href="edaphic">edaphic</a> conditions: it grows in both <a href="laterite">lateritic</a> sand and sands of <a href="Marine%20%28ocean%29">marine</a> origin, and it tolerates <a href="pH">pH</a> levels ranging from 3.8 to 6.6.

Consistent with these edaphic preferences, "A. cuneatus" is a frequent and characteristic member of the <a href="kwongan">kwongan</a> <a href="heath">heath</a>lands commonly found on the sandplains of <a href="Southwest%20Australia">Southwest Australia</a>. The climate in its range is <a href="mediterranean%20climate">mediterranean</a>, with annual rainfall from .

Colletid bees of the genus "<a href="Leioproctus">Leioproctus</a> "visit "Adenanthos cuneatus" flowers. A 1978 field study conducted around <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany</a> found the <a href="honey%20possum">honey possum</a> ("Tarsipes rostratus") occasionally visited "Adenanthos cuneatus", while the <a href="western%20spinebill">western spinebill</a> much preferred the species to other flowers. A 1980 field study at Cheyne beach showed that the <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater</a> and <a href="white-cheeked%20honeyeater">white-cheeked honeyeater</a> pollinate it A 1985–86 field study in the <a href="Fitzgerald%20River%20National%20Park">Fitzgerald River National Park</a> found that the nectar-feeding honey possum occasionally eats it. The <a href="silvereye">silvereye</a> ("Zosterops lateralis") feeds on nectar from the flowers, and has also been observed taking dew-drops from leaves early in the morning.

"Adenanthos cuneatus" is known to be susceptible to "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>" <a href="Root%20rot">dieback</a>, but reports on the degree of susceptibility vary from low to high. A study of "Banksia attenuata" woodland southeast of Perth across 16 years, and following a wave of "P. cinnamomi" infestation, showed that "A. cuneatus" populations were not significantly reduced in diseased areas. <a href="Phosphite">Phosphite</a> (used to combat dieback) has some toxic effects in "A. cuneatus", with some necrosis of leaf tips, but the shrub uptakes little of the compound when compared with other shrubs. Specimens in coastal dune vegetation showed some sensitivity to the fungus "<a href="Armillaria%20luteobubalina">Armillaria luteobubalina</a>", with between a quarter and a half of plants exposed succumbing to the pathogen.

"Adenanthos cuneatus" was taken to Great Britain in 1824, and has been grown in cultivation in Australia and the western United States. Its attractive bronzed or reddish foliage is its main horticultural feature, along with its ability to attract birds to the garden. It requires a well-drained position to do well, but will grow in full sun or semi-shade, and tolerates both sand and gravelly soils. <a href="George%20Lullfitz">George Lullfitz</a>, a Western Australian nurseryman, recommends growing it as a rambling ground cover in front of other shrubs, or in a <a href="Garden%20design%23Rock%20garden">rockery</a>.

Death of Cleopatra

The death of Cleopatra VII, the last reigning ruler of <a href="Ptolemaic%20Egypt">Ptolemaic Egypt</a>, occurred on either 10 or 12 August 30 BC in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, when she was 39 years old. According to popular belief, <a href="Cleopatra">Cleopatra</a> committed suicide by allowing an <a href="Asp%20%28reptile%29">asp</a> (<a href="Egyptian%20cobra">Egyptian cobra</a>) to bite her. According to <a href="Greek%20historiography">Greek</a> and <a href="Roman%20historiography">Roman historians</a>, Cleopatra <a href="Poisoning">poisoned</a> herself using either a <a href="Neurotoxin">toxic</a> ointment or sharp implement such as a hairpin. <a href="Primary%20source">Primary source</a> accounts are derived mainly from the works of the ancient Roman historians <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>, <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, and <a href="Cassius%20Dio">Cassius Dio</a>. Modern scholars debate the validity of ancient reports involving snakebites as the cause of death and if she was murdered or not. Some academics hypothesize that her <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> political rival <a href="Octavian">Octavian</a> forced her to commit suicide in the manner of her choosing. The location of <a href="Tomb%20of%20Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Cleopatra's tomb</a> is unknown. It was recorded that Octavian allowed for her and husband, the Roman politician and general <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a>, who stabbed himself with a sword, to be <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20funeral%20and%20burial%20practices">buried together properly</a>.

Cleopatra's death effectively ended <a href="Final%20War%20of%20the%20Roman%20Republic">the final war</a> of the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a> between <a href="Second%20Triumvirate">triumvirs</a> Octavian and Antony, in which Cleopatra aligned herself with Antony, father to three of her children. Antony and Cleopatra fled to Egypt following their loss at the 31 BC <a href="Battle%20of%20Actium">Battle of Actium</a> in <a href="Roman%20Greece">Roman Greece</a>, after which Octavian invaded Egypt and defeated their forces. Committing suicide allowed her to avoid the humiliation of being paraded as a prisoner in a <a href="Roman%20triumph">Roman triumph</a> celebrating the <a href="Wars%20of%20Augustus">military victories of Octavian</a>, who would become <a href="Roman%20emperor">Rome's first emperor</a> in 27 BC and be known as <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a>. Octavian had Cleopatra's son Caesarion (also known as <a href="Ptolemy%20XV">Ptolemy XV</a>), rival heir of <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>, killed in Egypt but spared her children with Antony and brought them to <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. Cleopatra's death marked the end of the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic period</a> and <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic rule</a> of <a href="History%20of%20Egypt">Egypt</a>, as well as the beginning of <a href="Roman%20Egypt">Roman Egypt</a>, which became a <a href="Roman%20province">province</a> of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>. 

The death of Cleopatra has been depicted in <a href="List%20of%20cultural%20depictions%20of%20Cleopatra">various works of art</a> throughout history. These include the visual, literary, and performance arts, ranging from sculptures and paintings to poetry and plays, as well as modern films. Cleopatra featured prominently in the prose and poetry of ancient <a href="Latin%20literature">Latin literature</a>. While surviving <a href="Roman%20art">ancient Roman</a> depictions of her death in visual arts are rare, <a href="Medieval%20art">Medieval</a>, <a href="Renaissance%20art">Renaissance</a>, <a href="Baroque%20art">Baroque</a>, and <a href="Modern%20art">Modern</a> works are numerous. Ancient <a href="Greco-Roman">Greco-Roman</a> <a href="Roman%20sculpture">sculptures</a> such as the "<a href="Esquiline%20Venus">Esquiline Venus</a>" and "<a href="Sleeping%20Ariadne">Sleeping Ariadne</a>" served as inspirations for later artworks portraying her death, universally involving the snakebite of an asp. Cleopatra's death has evoked themes of <a href="eroticism">eroticism</a> and sexuality, in works that include paintings, plays, and films, especially from the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>. Modern works depicting Cleopatra's death include <a href="Neoclassical%20sculpture">Neoclassical sculpture</a>, <a href="Orientalist%20painting">Orientalist painting</a>, and cinema.

Following the <a href="First%20Triumvirate">First Triumvirate</a> and <a href="assassination%20of%20Julius%20Caesar">assassination of Julius Caesar</a> in 44 BC, the Roman statesmen <a href="Octavian">Octavian</a>, <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a>, and <a href="Marcus%20Aemilius%20Lepidus%20%28triumvir%29">Aemilius Lepidus</a> were <a href="Elections%20in%20the%20Roman%20Republic">elected</a> as <a href="triumvirate">triumvir</a>s to <a href="Liberators%27%20civil%20war">bring Caesar's assassins to justice</a>, forming the <a href="Second%20Triumvirate">Second Triumvirate</a>. With Lepidus marginalized in <a href="Africa%20%28Roman%20province%29">Africa</a> and eventually placed under house arrest by Octavian, the two remaining triumvirs divided control over the Roman world between the <a href="Greek%20East%20and%20Latin%20West">Greek East and Latin West</a>, Antony taking the former and Octavian the latter. <a href="Cleopatra%20VII">Cleopatra VII</a> of <a href="Ptolemaic%20Egypt">Ptolemaic Egypt</a>, a pharaoh of <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>ian <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> descent who ruled from Alexandria, had an extramarital affair with <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> that produced a son and eventual <a href="List%20of%20Ptolemaic%20rulers">Ptolemaic</a> co-ruler <a href="Caesarion">Caesarion</a>. After Caesar's death she developed a relationship with Antony. 

With encouragement from Cleopatra, Antony officially divorced Octavian's sister <a href="Octavia%20Minor">Octavia Minor</a> in 32 BC. It is likely he had already married Cleopatra during the <a href="Donations%20of%20Alexandria">Donations of Alexandria</a> in 34 BC. Antony's divorce from Octavia, Octavian's public revelation of Antony's will outlining Cleopatra's ambitions for Roman territory in the Donations of Alexandria and her continued illegal military support for a <a href="Roman%20citizenship">Roman citizen</a> currently without an elected office convinced the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman Senate</a>, now under Octavian's control, to <a href="Final%20War%20of%20the%20Roman%20Republic">declare war on Cleopatra</a>.

Following their defeat in the naval <a href="Battle%20of%20Actium">Battle of Actium</a> at the <a href="Ambracian%20Gulf">Ambracian Gulf</a> of Greece in 31 BC, Cleopatra and Antony retreated back to Egypt to recuperate and prepare for an assault by Octavian, whose forces grew larger with the surrender of many of Antony's officers and soldiers in Greece. After a long period of failed negotiations, Octavian's forces invaded Egypt in the spring of 30 BC. While Octavian captured <a href="Pelousion">Pelousion</a> near the eastern borders of Ptolemaic Egypt, his officer <a href="Cornelius%20Gallus">Cornelius Gallus</a> marched from <a href="Cyrene%2C%20Libya">Cyrene</a> and captured <a href="Mersa%20Matruh">Paraitonion</a> to the west. Although Antony was able to score a small victory over Octavian's tired troops as they approached Alexandria's <a href="hippodrome">hippodrome</a> on 1 August 30 BC, his naval fleet and cavalry defected to Octavian soon afterwards.

With Octavian's forces in Alexandria, Cleopatra withdrew to her tomb with her closest attendants and had a message sent to Antony that she had committed suicide. Antony ordered his slave Eros to murder him, but instead Eros turned his sword on himself and committed suicide. In despair, Antony stabbed himself through the stomach with a sword, dying at age 53. In <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>'s telling, Antony was still alive as he was carried into Cleopatra's tomb, telling her in his dying words that he would die honorably and that she could trust a certain on Octavian's side to treat her well. The same Proculeius used a ladder to breach a window of Cleopatra's tomb and detain her inside before she could have a chance to commit suicide or burn herself to death along with her vast treasure. Cleopatra was allowed to <a href="embalm">embalm</a> Antony's body before she was forcefully escorted to the palace, where she eventually met with Octavian, who had also detained three of her children: <a href="Alexander%20Helios">Alexander Helios</a>, <a href="Cleopatra%20Selene%20II">Cleopatra Selene II</a>, and <a href="Ptolemy%20Philadelphus%20%28son%20of%20Cleopatra%29">Ptolemy Philadelphus</a>.

As related by <a href="Livy">Livy</a>, in her meeting with Octavian, Cleopatra told him candidly, "I will not be led in a triumph" (), but Octavian only gave the cryptic answer that her life would be spared. He did not offer her any specific details about his plans for Egypt or her royal family. When a spy informed Cleopatra that Octavian intended to bring her back to <a href="Rome">Rome</a> to be paraded as a prisoner in his <a href="Roman%20triumph">Roman triumph</a>, she decided to avoid this humiliation and took her own life at age 39, in August 30 BC. Plutarch elaborates how Cleopatra approached her suicide in an almost ritual process that involved bathing and then a fine meal including figs brought to her in a basket.
Plutarch writes that Octavian ordered his freedman <a href="Epaphroditus%20%28freedman%20of%20Augustus%29">Epaphroditus</a> to guard her and prevent her from committing suicide. Nevertheless, Cleopatra was able to deceive him and kill herself. When Octavian received a note from Cleopatra requesting that she be buried next to Antony, he had his messengers rush to her. The servant broke down her door but was too late. Plutarch states that she was found with her handmaidens Iras, dying at her feet, and <a href="Charmion%20%28servant%20to%20Cleopatra%29">Charmion</a>, adjusting Cleopatra's <a href="diadem">diadem</a> before she herself fell. It is unclear from primary sources if their suicides took place within the palace or inside Cleopatra's tomb. Cassius Dio claims that Octavian called on trained <a href="snake%20charmers">snake charmers</a> of the <a href="Psylli">Psylli</a> tribe of <a href="Ancient%20Libya">Ancient Libya</a> to attempt an oral <a href="Snake%20venom">venom extraction</a> and revival of Cleopatra, but their efforts failed. Although Octavian was outraged by these events and "was robbed of the full splendor of his victory" according to Cassius Dio, he had Cleopatra interred next to Antony in their tomb as requested, and also gave Iras and Charmion proper burials.

There are no surviving records dating Cleopatra's death. <a href="Theodore%20Cressy%20Skeat">Theodore Cressy Skeat</a> deduced that she died on 12 August 30 BC on the basis of contemporary records of fixed events along with cross examination of historical sources. His supposition is supported by <a href="Stanley%20M.%20Burstein">Stanley M. Burstein</a>, James Grout, and <a href="Aidan%20Dodson">Aidan Dodson</a> and Dyan Hitlon, although the latter are more cautious by qualifying it was "circa" 12 August. An alternative date of 10 August 30 BC is supported by scholars such as <a href="Duane%20W.%20Roller">Duane W. Roller</a>, <a href="Joann%20Fletcher">Joann Fletcher</a>, and <a href="Jaynie%20Anderson">Jaynie Anderson</a>.

Cleopatra's personal physician Olympos, <a href="Parallel%20Lives">cited by Plutarch</a>, mentioned neither a cause of death nor an <a href="Asp%20%28reptile%29">asp</a> bite or <a href="Egyptian%20cobra">Egyptian cobra</a>. <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>, who provides the earliest known historical account, believed that Cleopatra committed suicide either by asp bite or poisonous ointment. Plutarch mentions the tale of the asp brought to her in a basket of figs, although he offers other alternatives for her cause of death, such as use of a hollow implement (), perhaps a hairpin, which she used to scratch open the skin and introduce the toxin. According to Cassius Dio small puncture wounds were found on Cleopatra's arm, but he echoed the claim by Plutarch that nobody knew the true cause of her death. Dio mentioned the claim of the asp and even suggested use of a needle (), possibly from a hairpin, which would seem to corroborate Plutarch's account. Other contemporary historians such as <a href="Florus">Florus</a> and <a href="Velleius%20Paterculus">Velleius Paterculus</a> supported the asp bite version. Roman physician <a href="Galen">Galen</a> mentioned the asp story, but he advances a version where Cleopatra bit her arm and introduced venom brought in a container. <a href="Suetonius">Suetonius</a> relayed the story of the asp but expressed doubt about its validity.

The cause of Cleopatra's death was rarely mentioned and debated in early modern scholarship. The encyclopedic writer <a href="Thomas%20Browne">Thomas Browne</a>, in his 1646 "<a href="Pseudodoxia%20Epidemica">Pseudodoxia Epidemica</a>", explained that it was uncertain how Cleopatra had died and that artistic depictions of small snakes biting her failed to accurately show the larger size of the land asp. In 1717 the anatomist <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Morgagni">Giovanni Battista Morgagni</a> maintained a brief, recreational literary correspondence with the papal physician <a href="Giovanni%20Maria%20Lancisi">Giovanni Maria Lancisi</a> about the queen's cause of death, as referenced in Morgagni's 1761 "De Sedibus" and published as a series of <a href="epistle">epistle</a>s in his 1764 "Opera omnis". Morgagni argued that Cleopatra was likely killed by a snakebite and contested Lancisi's suggestion that consumption of venom was more plausible, noting that no ancient Greco-Roman authors had mentioned her drinking it. Lancisi rebutted by arguing that accounts offered by Roman poets were unreliable since they often exaggerated events. In his literary memoirs published in 1777, the physician <a href="Jean%20Goulin">Jean Goulin</a> supported Morgagni's argument of the snakebite being the most probable cause of death.
Modern scholars have also cast doubt on the story of the <a href="venomous%20snake">venomous snake</a>bite as the cause of death. Roller notes the prominence of snakes in <a href="Egyptian%20mythology">Egyptian mythology</a> while also asserting that no surviving historical account discusses the difficulty of smuggling a large Egyptian cobra into Cleopatra's chambers and then having it behave as intended. William Maloney, Clinical Associate Professor at New York University, concurs with this assessment, noting the incredible weight of these reptiles, but states that their venom is very powerful, whereas Roller claims the venom is only fatal if injected into a vital area of the body. <a href="Egyptologist">Egyptologist</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20Spiegelberg">Wilhelm Spiegelberg</a> (1870–1930) argued that Cleopatra's choice of suicide by asp bite was one that befitted her royal status, the asp representing the "<a href="uraeus">uraeus</a>", sacred serpent of the <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">ancient Egyptian</a> sun god <a href="Ra">Ra</a>. Robert A. Gurval, Associate Professor of Classics at UCLA, points out that the <a href="Ancient%20Athens">Athenian</a> "<a href="strategos">strategos</a>" <a href="Demetrios%20of%20Phaleron">Demetrios of Phaleron</a> (c. 350 – c. 280 BC), confined by <a href="Ptolemy%20II%20Philadelphus">Ptolemy II Philadelphus</a> in Egypt, committed suicide by asp bite in a "curiously similar" manner, one that also demonstrated that it was not exclusive to Egyptian royalty. Gurval notes that the bite of an Egyptian cobra contains around 175–300 mg of <a href="neurotoxin">neurotoxin</a>, lethal to humans with only 15–20 mg, although death would not have been immediate as victims usually stay alive for several hours. François Pieter Retief, retired lecturer and dean of medicine at the <a href="University%20of%20the%20Free%20State">University of the Free State</a>, and Louise Cilliers, honorary research fellow at their Department of Greek, Latin and Classical Studies, argue that a large snake would not have fit into a basket of figs and it was more likely that poisoning would have so rapidly killed the three adult women, Cleopatra and her handmaidens Charmion and Iras. Noting the example of Cleopatra's hairpin, Cilliers and Retief also highlight how other ancient figures poisoned themselves in similar ways, including <a href="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a>, <a href="Hannibal">Hannibal</a>, and <a href="Mithridates%20VI%20of%20Pontus">Mithridates VI of Pontus</a>.

According to Gregory Tsoucalas, lecturer in the history of medicine at the Democritus University of Thrace, and Markos Sgantzos, Associate Professor of Anatomy at the University of Thessaly, evidence suggests that Octavian ordered the poisoning of Cleopatra. Their claim of alleged murder by Octavian is supported by other authors such as Maloney. In "Murder of Cleopatra", the criminal profiler <a href="Pat%20Brown%20%28criminal%20profiler%29">Pat Brown</a> argues that Cleopatra was murdered and the details of it were covered up by Roman authorities. Claims that she was murdered contradict the majority of primary sources that report her cause of death as suicide. Historian <a href="Patricia%20Southern">Patricia Southern</a> speculates that Octavian could have possibly allowed Cleopatra to choose the manner of her death instead of executing her. Grout writes that Octavian may have wanted to avoid the sort of sympathy espoused for Cleopatra's younger sister <a href="Arsinoe%20IV">Arsinoe IV</a> when she was paraded in chains but spared during <a href="Military%20campaigns%20of%20Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar's triumph</a>. Octavian perhaps permitted Cleopatra to die by her own hand after considering the political issues that could have risen from the murder of a queen whose statue had been erected in the Temple of <a href="Venus%20Genetrix">Venus Genetrix</a> by his adoptive father Caesar.

During her final days, Cleopatra had Caesarion sent away to Upper Egypt and perhaps planned for him to eventually flee to <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>, Ethiopia, or India in exile. Caesarion reigned as Ptolemy XV for only eighteen days, when he was captured and executed on Octavian's orders on 29 August 30 BC. This was done following the advice of the Alexandrian <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20philosophy">Greek philosopher</a> <a href="Arius%20Didymus">Arius Didymus</a>, who cautioned that two rival heirs to Julius Caesar could not share the world together. 

The deaths of Cleopatra and Caesarion marked the end of both the <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic dynasty</a>'s rule of Egypt and the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic period</a>, which had lasted since the reign of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> (r. 336–323 BC). <a href="Roman%20Egypt">Egypt</a> became a <a href="Roman%20province">province</a> of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire">newly established</a> <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, with Octavian <a href="Constitutional%20reforms%20of%20Augustus">renamed</a> in 27 BC as <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a>, the first <a href="Roman%20emperor">Roman emperor</a>, ruling with the facade of a <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a>. Roller affirms that Caesarion's alleged reign was "essentially a fiction" invented by chroniclers of Egypt, such as <a href="Clement%20of%20Alexandria">Clement of Alexandria</a> in his "<a href="Stromata">Stromata</a>", to explain the gap between Cleopatra's death and the induction of Egypt as a Roman province directly ruled by Octavian as pharaoh of Egypt. Antony's three children with Cleopatra were spared and sent to Rome; their daughter Cleopatra Selene II eventually married <a href="Juba%20II">Juba II</a> of <a href="Mauretania">Mauretania</a>.

The site of the <a href="Tomb%20of%20Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">mausoleum of Cleopatra and Mark Antony</a> is uncertain. The <a href="Egyptian%20Antiquities%20Service">Egyptian Antiquities Service</a> believes that it is in or near a temple of <a href="Taposiris%20Magna">Taposiris Magna</a>, southwest of <a href="History%20of%20Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. In their excavations of the temple of <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a> at Taposiris Magna, archaeologists <a href="Kathleen%20Martinez">Kathleen Martinez</a> and <a href="Zahi%20Hawass">Zahi Hawass</a> have discovered six burial chambers and their artifacts, including forty <a href="Ptolemaic%20coinage">coins</a> minted by Cleopatra and Antony as well as an alabaster bust depicting Cleopatra. An alabaster mask with a cleft chin discovered at the site bears a resemblance to ancient portraits of Mark Antony. In an from the House of Giuseppe II in <a href="Pompeii">Pompeii</a>, a rear wall depicted with a set of double doors positioned very high above the scene of a woman wearing a royal diadem and committing suicide among her attendants suggests the described layout of Cleopatra's tomb in Alexandria.

In his triumphal procession at Rome in 29 BC, Octavian paraded Cleopatra's children Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II, but he also presented an effigy to the crowd depicting Cleopatra with an asp clinging to her. This was likely the same painting discovered in emperor <a href="Hadrian%27s%20Villa">Hadrian's Villa</a> in 1818, now lost but described in an archaeological report and in a <a href="steel%20engraving">steel engraving</a> by <a href="John%20Sartain">John Sartain</a>. The poet <a href="Propertius">Propertius</a>, an eyewitness of Octavian's triumph along the <a href="Via%20Sacra">Via Sacra</a>, noted that the paraded image of Cleopatra contained multiple snakes biting each of her arms. Citing Plutarch, Giuseppe Pucci indicates that the effigy may have even been a statue. In his "Notes isiaques I" (1989), French Archaeologist observed that an ancient <a href="Roman%20portraiture">Roman statue</a> of a woman wearing a <a href="Tyet">knot of Isis</a> in the <a href="Vatican%20Museums">Vatican Museums</a> portrays a snake crawling up her right breast, perhaps a depiction of Cleopatra's suicide while dressed as the <a href="Egyptian%20goddess">Egyptian goddess</a> <a href="Isis">Isis</a>. Cleopatra's association with Isis continued in Egypt after her death, at least until 373 AD, when the Egyptian scribe Petesenufe compiled a book of Isis and explained how he decorated images of Cleopatra with gold.

A mid-1st century BC <a href="Roman%20art">Roman wall painting</a> from <a href="Pompeian%20Styles">Pompeii</a> most likely was walled off by its owner around 30 BC, perhaps in reaction to Octavian's proscription against images depicting Caesarion, the rival heir of Julius Caesar. Although statues of Mark Antony were torn down, those of Cleopatra were generally spared this program of destruction, including the one erected by Caesar in the <a href="Temple%20of%20Venus%20Genetrix">Temple of Venus Genetrix</a> in the <a href="Forum%20of%20Caesar">Forum of Caesar</a>. An most likely depicts the suicide of Cleopatra, accompanied by attendants and even her son Caesarion wearing a royal diadem like his mother, although an asp is absent from the scene, perhaps reflecting the different causes of death provided in <a href="Roman%20historiography">Roman historiography</a>. Some posthumous images of Cleopatra meant for common consumption were perhaps less flattering. A Roman terracotta lamp in the British Museum made circa 40–80 AD contains a relief depicting a nude woman with the queen's distinct hairstyle. In it she holds a palm branch, rides an Egyptian crocodile and sits on a large phallus in a Nilotic scene.

The story of the asp was widely accepted among the <a href="Augustan%20literature%20%28ancient%20Rome%29">Augustan-period</a> <a href="Latin%20poetry">Latin poets</a> such as <a href="Horace">Horace</a> and <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>, in which two snakes were even suggested as biting Cleopatra. Although retaining the negative views of Cleopatra apparent in other pro-Augustan <a href="Roman%20literature">Roman literature</a>, Horace depicted Cleopatra's suicide as a bold act of defiance and liberation. Virgil established the view of Cleopatra as a figure of epic <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a> and romance.

The story of Cleopatra's suicide by snakebite was often depicted in <a href="Medieval%20art">Medieval</a> and <a href="Renaissance%20art">Renaissance art</a>. The artist known as the <a href="Boucicaut%20Master">Boucicaut Master</a>, in a 1409 AD <a href="Miniature%20%28illuminated%20manuscript%29">miniature</a> for an <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a> of "Des cas de nobles hommes et femmes" by 14th-century AD poet <a href="Giovanni%20Boccaccio">Giovanni Boccaccio</a>, in a <a href="International%20Gothic">Gothic-style</a> tomb, with a snake near Cleopatra's chest and a bloody sword driven through Antony's chest. Illustrated versions of Boccaccio's written works, including images of Cleopatra and Antony committing suicide, first appeared in France during the <a href="Quattrocento">Quattrocento</a> (i.e. 15th century AD), authored by <a href="Laurent%20de%20Premierfait">Laurent de Premierfait</a>. <a href="Woodcut">Woodcut</a> illustrations of Boccaccio's "<a href="De%20Mulieribus%20Claris">De Mulieribus Claris</a>" published at <a href="Ulm">Ulm</a> in 1479 and <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a> in 1541 depict Cleopatra's discovery of Antony's body after his suicide by stabbing.

Like much of <a href="Medieval%20literature">Medieval literature</a> about Cleopatra, Boccaccio's writings are largely negative and misogynistic. The 14th-century poet <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a> counters these depictions, offering a positive view of Cleopatra. Chaucer began his <a href="hagiography">hagiography</a> <a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Good%20Women">on virtuous pagan women</a> with the life of Cleopatra, depicted in a satirical fashion as a queen engaged in <a href="courtly%20love">courtly love</a> with her knight Mark Antony. His depiction of her suicide included a pit of serpents rather than the Roman tale of the asps.
Free-standing nude depictions of Cleopatra poisoned by an asp became common curing the <a href="Italian%20Renaissance">Italian Renaissance</a>. The 16th-century <a href="Venetian%20school%20%28art%29">Venetian artist</a> Giovanni Maria Padovano (i.e. Mosca) created two marble reliefs of the suicide of Antony and Cleopatra, as well as several free-standing nude statues of Cleopatra being bitten by the asp that were partly inspired by ancient <a href="Roman%20sculpture">Roman sculpture</a>s such as the "<a href="Esquiline%20Venus">Esquiline Venus</a>". <a href="Bartolommeo%20Bandinelli">Bartolommeo Bandinelli</a> created a drawing of Cleopatra as a free-standing nude committing suicide that served as the basis for a similar engraving by <a href="Agostino%20Veneziano">Agostino Veneziano</a>. Another engraving by Veneziano and a drawing by <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a> depicting Cleopatra's suicide as she slumbered were inspired by the ancient <a href="Greco-Roman">Greco-Roman</a> "<a href="Sleeping%20Ariadne">Sleeping Ariadne</a>", which at the time was thought to depict Cleopatra. Works of the <a href="French%20Renaissance">French Renaissance</a> also depict Cleopatra slumbering while pressing a snake to her breast. <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a> created a black-chalk drawing of Cleopatra's suicide by asp bite around 1535. The 17th-century <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> painter <a href="Guido%20Reni">Guido Reni</a> by asp bite, albeit with a snake that is tiny compared to a real Egyptian cobra.

The "Sleeping Ariadne", acquired by <a href="Pope%20Julius%20II">Pope Julius II</a> in 1512, inspired three poems of <a href="Renaissance%20literature">Renaissance literature</a> eventually carved into the <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a> frame of the statue. The first of these was published by <a href="Baldassare%20Castiglione">Baldassare Castiglione</a>, which became widely circulated by 1530 and inspired the other two poems by <a href="Bernardino%20Baldi">Bernardino Baldi</a> and <a href="Agostino%20Favoriti">Agostino Favoriti</a>. Castiglione's poem depicted Cleopatra as a tragic but honorable ruler in a doomed love affair with Antony, a queen whose death freed her from the ignominy of Roman imprisonment. The "Sleeping Ariadne" was also commonly depicted in paintings, including those by <a href="Titian">Titian</a>, <a href="Artemisia%20Gentileschi">Artemisia Gentileschi</a>, and <a href="Edward%20Burne-Jones">Edward Burne-Jones</a>. These works tended to <a href="Erotic%20art">eroticize</a> the moment of Cleopatra's death, while <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a> artists found the unconscious, recumbent female form as an acceptable outlet for their eroticism.
Cleopatra's death features in several works of the performing arts. In the 1607 <a href="Play%20%28theatre%29">play</a> "<a href="Devil%27s%20Charter">Devil's Charter</a>" by <a href="Barnabe%20Barnes">Barnabe Barnes</a>, a <a href="snake%20handler">snake handler</a> brings two asps to Cleopatra and allows them to bite both her breasts in a racy manner. In <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s 1609 play "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>" the snake represents both death as well as a lover who Cleopatra desires, yielding to his pinch. Shakespeare relied on <a href="Thomas%20North">Thomas North</a>'s 1579 translation of Plutarch for crafting his play, which can be viewed as both a comedy and a tragedy. The play involved use of multiple asps, as well as the character of Charmion who killed herself by asp bite after Cleopatra.

In modern literature, <a href="Ted%20Hughes">Ted Hughes</a>' poem "Cleopatra to the Asp" (1960) creates a monologue of Cleopatra speaking to the asp that is about to kill her. During the Victorian era, plays such as "Cléopâtre" (1890) by <a href="Victorien%20Sardou">Victorien Sardou</a> became popular, although audiences were generally shocked by the emotional intensity of stage actress <a href="Sarah%20Bernhardt">Sarah Bernhardt</a>'s depiction of Cleopatra reacting to Antony's suicide. In opera, <a href="Samuel%20Barber">Samuel Barber</a>'s "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra%20%28opera%29">Antony and Cleopatra</a>", first performed in 1966 and based on Shakespeare's play, Cleopatra recounts a dream that Antony, now dead before her, would become emperor of Rome. When <a href="Publius%20Cornelius%20Dolabella%20%28suffect%20consul%2035%20BC%29">Dollabella</a> informs her that Caesar intends to march her in his triumph in Rome, she commits suicide with Charmion by asp bite, before being carried off to be buried with Antony.
The character of Cleopatra had appeared in forty-three films by the end of the 20th century. <a href="Georges%20M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s">Georges Méliès</a>' "<a href="Robbing%20Cleopatra%27s%20Tomb">Robbing Cleopatra's Tomb</a>" (), an 1899 French <a href="Silent%20film">silent</a> horror film, was the first to depict the character of Cleopatra. Following the <a href="Italo-Turkish%20War">Italo-Turkish War</a> (1911–1912), the 1913 <a href="Cinema%20of%20Italy">Italian film</a> "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra%20%281913%20film%29">Marcantonio e Cleopatra</a>" by <a href="Enrico%20Guazzoni">Enrico Guazzoni</a> depicted Cleopatra as the embodiment of the cruel <a href="Orient">Orient</a>, a queen who had defied Rome, while the actions of her lover Antony, after his suicide, are forgiven by Octavian. In cultivating a stage persona for her character in the 1917 US film "<a href="Cleopatra%20%281917%20film%29">Cleopatra</a>", actress <a href="Theda%20Bara">Theda Bara</a> was seen in public petting snakes while the <a href="Fox%20Film%20Corporation">Fox Film Corporation</a> posed her in front of Cleopatra's alleged <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20funerary%20practices">mummified remains</a> in a museum, where she announced that she was the reincarnation of Cleopatra, having received <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">hieroglyphic</a> tributary offerings from a reincarnated servant. Fox Studios also had Bara dress as a leader of the occult and associated her with perverse <a href="Death%20drive">death and sexuality</a>. The 1963 Hollywood film "<a href="Cleopatra%20%281963%20film%29">Cleopatra</a>" by <a href="Joseph%20L.%20Mankiewicz">Joseph L. Mankiewicz</a> contains a dramatic scene where the Egyptian queen, portrayed by <a href="Elizabeth%20Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a>, is engaged in a slap-fight with her lover Mark Antony, portrayed by <a href="Richard%20Burton">Richard Burton</a>, inside the tomb where they would be interred.

In other modern visual arts, Cleopatra has been depicted in mediums such as paintings and sculptures. In her 1876 sculpture "The Death of Cleopatra", African American artist <a href="Edmonia%20Lewis">Edmonia Lewis</a>, despite championing the non-white female form in artworks, chose to depict Cleopatra with <a href="Caucasian%20race">Caucasian features</a>, perhaps in keeping with Cleopatra's recorded lineage as a <a href="Ancient%20Macedonians">Macedonian Greek</a>. Lewis' <a href="Neoclassical%20sculpture">Neoclassical sculpture</a> offers a <a href="Post-mortem%20interval">post-mortem</a> view of Cleopatra dressed in Egyptian regalia and sitting on her throne, which is decorated with two <a href="sphinx">sphinx</a> heads that represent the twins she bore with Mark Antony: Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II. An 1880 , now found in <a href="Lille">Lille</a>, France, was once thought to be a work by <a href="Albert%20Darcq">Albert Darcq</a>, but restoration and cleaning of the sculpture revealed the signature of <a href="Charles%20Gauthier">Charles Gauthier</a>, to whom the work is now attributed. The 1874 painting "Death of Cleopatra" by <a href="Jean-Andr%C3%A9%20Rixens">Jean-André Rixens</a> depicts a dead Cleopatra with very light skin, accompanied by maidservants with rather dark skin, a combination frequently found in modern artworks portraying the scene of Cleopatra's death. <a href="Orientalist%20painting">Orientalist painting</a>s by Rixens and others influenced the hybrid Ancient-Egyptian and Middle-Eastern decor found in the <a href="J.%20Gordon%20Edwards">J.

James E. Boyd (scientist)

James Emory "Jim" Boyd (July 18, 1906 – February 18, 1998) was an American physicist, mathematician, and <a href="academic%20administrator">academic administrator</a>. He was director of the <a href="Georgia%20Tech%20Research%20Institute">Georgia Tech Research Institute</a> from 1957 to 1961, president of <a href="University%20of%20West%20Georgia">West Georgia College</a> (now the University of West Georgia) from 1961 to 1971, and acting president of the <a href="Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> from 1971 to 1972.

A graduate of the <a href="University%20of%20Georgia">University of Georgia</a> and <a href="Duke%20University">Duke University</a>, Boyd began in academia as a professor of physics at West Georgia College. He then became a professor at Georgia Tech and a prominent researcher at the Engineering Experiment Station, now known as the Georgia Tech Research Institute. At the Engineering Experiment Station, Boyd helped spur the organization's mainstay: <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">federally</a> funded electronics research and development. Along with fellow Georgia Tech researchers <a href="Gerald%20Rosselot">Gerald Rosselot</a> and <a href="Glen%20P.%20Robinson">Glen P. Robinson</a>, Boyd was influential in the founding of <a href="Scientific%20Atlanta">Scientific Atlanta</a>, where he was a board member for 25 years. As director of the Engineering Experiment Station, Boyd focused on the recruitment of talented engineers and an increase in physical space available to the organization, including the establishment of nuclear research at Georgia Tech with a <a href="radioisotope">radioisotope</a>s laboratory and the construction of the <a href="Neely%20Nuclear%20Research%20Center">Frank H. Neely Research Reactor</a>.

While he was the third president of West Georgia College, Boyd increased faculty, degrees, programs, and both undergraduate and graduate enrollment on the campus. Boyd racially integrated the campus in 1963, unprompted by a court order, and oversaw immense construction projects that dramatically expanded the campus to support the increased (and future) enrollment. Hired away to serve as the <a href="University%20System%20of%20Georgia">University System of Georgia</a>'s Vice Chancellor for Academic Development in 1970, he was almost immediately reassigned to be Georgia Tech's interim president. During his tenure at Georgia Tech from 1971 to 1972, Boyd resolved difficult issues in the attempted takeover of the Engineering Experiment Station by previous Georgia Tech president <a href="Arthur%20G.%20Hansen">Arthur G. Hansen</a> and the poor performance of (and corresponding alumni calls to remove) head football coach <a href="Bud%20Carson">Bud Carson</a>.

Boyd was born to Emory Fortson and Rosa Lee (née Wright) Boyd on July 18, 1906 in <a href="Tignall%2C%20Georgia">Tignall, Georgia</a>, a small town near the eastern border of the state of <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>. He had two brothers, John and Ellis, and a sister, Sophia. In 1927, he received a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from the <a href="University%20of%20Georgia">University of Georgia</a>, where he was a member of the <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa%20Society">Phi Beta Kappa</a> <a href="honor%20society">honor society</a>. In 1928, he received a Master of Arts in mathematics from <a href="Duke%20University">Duke University</a>. From 1928 to 1930, Boyd was an instructor of physics at the University of Georgia. He entered graduate school at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> in 1930, and was a <a href="graduate%20assistant">graduate assistant</a> there from 1930–1931 and a Loomis Fellow from 1931–1933. He received his PhD in physics from Yale in 1933, with a thesis entitled "Scattering of X-Rays by Cold-Worked and by Annealed Beryllium". In his thesis, Boyd described the effects of reflecting radiation through samples of powdered, cold-worked and <a href="annealing%20%28metallurgy%29">annealed</a> <a href="beryllium">beryllium</a> with differing particle sizes. The experiment showed that beryllium crystals are "rather imperfect", that annealing caused "no appreciable change" in beryllium's <a href="lattice%20structure">lattice structure</a>, and that the <a href="mass%20absorption%20coefficient">mass absorption coefficient</a> of beryllium found in the experiment was reasonably close to the theoretical value calculated using <a href="Compton%20Scattering">Compton's empirical formula</a>.

Boyd was appointed as head of the Mathematics and Science Department at <a href="University%20of%20West%20Georgia">West Georgia College</a> in 1933. In 1935, he joined the faculty at the <a href="Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> as an assistant professor of physics. Boyd married Elizabeth Reynolds Cobb, daughter of <a href="Betty%20Reynolds%20Cobb">Betty Reynolds Cobb</a> and Hiram Felix Cobb, on June 2, 1934. James and Elizabeth went on to have two children: a daughter, Betty Cobb Boyd (born August 26, 1939) and a son, James Fortson Boyd (born October 9, 1942). With World War II under way, Boyd joined the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> in 1942, serving as a lieutenant and later lieutenant commander in the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Ordnance">Bureau of Ordnance</a>, performing research on radar. From 1945 to 1946, he was a commander in the <a href="Office%20of%20the%20Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Office of the Chief of Naval Operations</a> where he worked on radar and electronics.

In 1946, Boyd returned to Georgia Tech's physics department and its Engineering Experiment Station, where he worked as Assistant Project Director under Frank Lawrence (and, after Lawrence's departure, as Project Director) on an <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">Army Air Corps</a>-sponsored project studying <a href="microwave">microwave</a> <a href="Radio%20propagation">propagation</a>. As part of the project, he conducted long-range line-of-sight experiments between Georgia Tech and <a href="Mount%20Oglethorpe">Mount Oglethorpe</a> in North Georgia. In 1947, Boyd co-authored a study entitled "Propagation Studies of Electromagnetic Waves", which resulted in a series of related research contracts, including a large one obtained from the Navy Bureau of Ordnance on <a href="Fire-control%20radar">radar-directed fire control</a>. Boyd was promoted to professor of physics in 1948. Around 1950, under the authority of his rank of <a href="Commander%20%28United%20States%29">commander</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20Navy%20Reserve">U.S. Navy Reserve</a>, Boyd created a U.S. Navy Research Reserve Unit at Georgia Tech that included officers from both Georgia Tech and the <a href="Atlanta%20metropolitan%20area">Atlanta metropolitan area</a>. In the 1950s, Boyd was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%29">captain</a> and ran this unit until his departure from Georgia Tech.
In 1950, Boyd was named the first head of the newly created Physics Division of the Engineering Experiment Station (now known as the Georgia Tech Research Institute). Boyd recruited his former student <a href="Glen%20P.%20Robinson">Glen P. Robinson</a> to the station. In late 1951, Robinson, station director <a href="Gerald%20Rosselot">Gerald Rosselot</a> and Boyd helped start Scientific Associates (now <a href="Scientific%20Atlanta">Scientific Atlanta</a>, part of <a href="Cisco">Cisco</a>) with $700 in seed money to produce and market antenna products that were developed at the station, as the station's leadership did not think Georgia Tech should be involved in the manufacturing business. Georgia Tech vice president <a href="Cherry%20Logan%20Emerson%20%28engineer%29">Cherry Emerson</a> believed that EES employees' affiliation with Scientific Atlanta constituted a conflict of interest and asked Boyd, Rosselot, and Robinson to choose between the two organizations. Boyd resigned from his post at Scientific Atlanta and remained with Georgia Tech, but chose to retain his position on Scientific Atlanta's Board of Directors. According to Robinson, "Dr. Boyd is really considered the founder of Scientific Atlanta."

Boyd was promoted to Assistant Director of Research at the Engineering Experiment Station in 1954. He served as director of the station from July 1, 1957, until 1961. While at Georgia Tech, Boyd wrote an influential article about the role of <a href="research%20institute">research centers</a> at <a href="institutes%20of%20technology">institutes of technology</a>, which argued that research should be integrated with education; Boyd applied this by involving undergraduates in his day-to-day research. Boyd was known for his recruitment of faculty capable of both teaching and performing notable research. He was influential enough to be able to override the wishes of <a href="Joseph%20Howey">Joseph Howey</a>, director of the School of Physics, on occasion: for example, Boyd successfully hired physicist <a href="Earl%20W.%20McDaniel">Earl W. McDaniel</a> in 1954 over Howey's determined opposition.

Under Boyd's purview, the Engineering Experiment Station was awarded many electronics-related contracts, to the extent that an Electronics Division was created in 1959; it focused on radar and communications. In 1955, Georgia Tech president <a href="Blake%20Ragsdale%20Van%20Leer">Blake R. Van Leer</a> appointed Boyd to Georgia Tech's Nuclear Science Committee. The committee recommended the creation of a Radioisotopes Laboratory Facility and the construction of a large research reactor. The former was built and dedicated on January 7, 1959, and could receive, store, and process radioactive materials. The <a href="Neely%20Nuclear%20Research%20Center">Frank H. Neely Research Reactor</a> was completed in 1963 and was operational until 1996, when the fuel was removed because of safety concerns related to the nearby <a href="1996%20Summer%20Olympics">1996 Summer Olympics</a> events. In 1961, Boyd was succeeded in the directorship by <a href="Robert%20E.%20Stiemke">Robert E. Stiemke</a>, who had previously been the director of Georgia Tech's School of Civil Engineering.

Boyd became the third President of <a href="University%20of%20West%20Georgia">West Georgia College</a> in 1961 after William H. Row died of a heart attack. Boyd is most known for his peaceful <a href="racial%20integration">racial integration</a> of the campus (without waiting for a court order) in 1963 by inviting a young black woman, Lillian Williams, to attend the college; she eventually earned two degrees in education and in 1985 received the college's highest honor, the Founder's Award. In May 1964, Boyd invited <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy">Robert F. Kennedy</a> to the dedication of the campus chapel as the Kennedy Chapel, which was named after Robert's brother, U.S. President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, who had been assassinated in November 1963. During his visit, Robert Kennedy promoted the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>, which was then under debate in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a>.

Boyd dramatically expanded the college during his tenure, both in terms of headcount and academic diversity. Enrolment grew from 1,089 students upon his arrival in 1961 to 5,503 students on his departure in 1971. In 1959, there were two degrees and five programs available; in 1969–70 there were seven degrees and 45 programs. There were 94 graduate students in 1961; the first master's programs were offered in 1967, and by 1969 the number of graduate students had risen to 741. In 1969 alone, 80 new faculty members were hired, a number larger than the total number of faculty members a decade earlier. Several new buildings were constructed, including nine dormitories and five academic buildings. Policy changes occurred as well: in 1966, the curfew for <a href="Junior%20%28education%29">junior</a> and <a href="Senior%20%28education%29">senior</a> women was abolished, and <a href="fraternities%20and%20sororities">fraternities and sororities</a> were allowed on campus. In 1970, Boyd was named the <a href="University%20System%20of%20Georgia">University System of Georgia</a>'s first <a href="Chancellor%20%28education%29%23United%20States%203">vice chancellor</a> for academic development, effective once his successor (Emory graduate <a href="Ward%20B.%20Pafford">Ward B. Pafford</a>) was appointed in 1971.

In a little under a month after Boyd had assumed the vice chancellorship, then-Georgia Tech president <a href="Arthur%20G.%20Hansen">Arthur G. Hansen</a> resigned. Chancellor George L. Simpson appointed Boyd as Acting President of the Georgia Institute of Technology, a post he held from May 1971 to March 1972.

Simpson's selection of Boyd as interim president was influenced by Boyd's previous experience as an academic administrator, his experience as director of the Engineering Experiment Station, and Boyd's ongoing position on the station's board of directors. The chancellor hoped this combination would help resolve a brewing controversy over whether the Engineering Experiment Station should be integrated into Georgia Tech's academic units to improve both entities' competitiveness for federal money. The station had sizable and growing support from the state of Georgia and its Industrial Development Council, which developed products and methods and provided technical assistance for Georgia industry. However, due in part to efforts made by Boyd and previous station director Gerald Rosselot, the station increasingly relied on electronics research funding from the federal government. In 1971, funding to both Georgia Tech's academic units and the Experiment Station began to suffer due to a combination of a sharp decline in state funds and cuts to federal science, research, and education funding after the end of the <a href="Space%20Race">Space Race</a> funding boom. Similar institutions, such as the <a href="Battelle%20Memorial%20Institute">Battelle Memorial Institute</a>, <a href="SRI%20International">Stanford Research Institute</a>, and the <a href="Illinois%20Institute%20of%20Technology%20Research%20Institute">Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute</a> had weathered this storm by becoming exceedingly good at obtaining research contracts.

Boyd's predecessor Arthur G. Hansen's "bold and controversial" solution to both entities' problems was to completely integrate the station into Georgia Tech's academic units. On paper, this would dramatically increase Georgia Tech's stated research funding (as all of it would be performed through the academic units), and it would increase options and financial aid for graduate students. Another, less publicized, reason was that Georgia Tech would gain access to the contract organization's reserve fund, which was said to be over $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ). <a href="Thomas%20E.%20Stelson">Thomas E. Stelson</a>, <a href="Dean%20%28education%29">Dean</a> of the <a href="Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology%20College%20of%20Engineering">College of Engineering</a> at Georgia Tech, was named to "reorganize" the station. Publicly, Stelson's task was simply to recommend a plan for reorganization, but the administration clearly intended for Georgia Tech and the Engineering Experiment Station to be closely integrated. <a href="Maurice%20W.%20Long">Maurice W. Long</a>, who was director of the station at the time, viewed the move as a violation of the EES's <a href="charter">charter</a> as legislatively established by the <a href="Georgia%20General%20Assembly">Georgia General Assembly</a> in 1919, and asserted that Georgia Tech did not have the authority to merge the two institutions. EES employees and business executives involved with the station appealed to the <a href="Georgia%20Board%20of%20Regents">Georgia Board of Regents</a> and to <a href="Governor%20of%20Georgia">Governor of Georgia</a> (and future United States President) <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> (himself a Georgia Tech alumnus); the controversy received coverage in both "<a href="The%20Technique">The Technique</a>" and the "<a href="Atlanta%20Constitution">Atlanta Constitution</a>".

This was the climate into which Boyd entered as interim institute president after Hansen had announced, on April 27, 1971, that he would be departing Georgia Tech to become president of <a href="Purdue%20University">Purdue University</a> on July 1 of that year. Boyd stopped the plan for absolute absorption of the station, but did allow plans for closer control and more aggressive contract solicitation to proceed. Among these measures were increased resource-sharing, including increased sharing of physical assets and research staff. The latter was evidenced by the increase in joint faculty appointments between the EES and Georgia Tech. The move paid off, and the fiscal year 1970–1971 saw EES win new contracts and grants, totaling a record $5.2 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

Boyd had to deal with intense public pressure to fire the then <a href="Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football">Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football</a> coach, <a href="Bud%20Carson">Bud Carson</a>. Georgia Tech alumni – accustomed to success under football legends <a href="John%20Heisman">John Heisman</a> (whose career wins–losses–draws statistics were ), <a href="William%20A.%20Alexander">William A. Alexander</a> () and <a href="Bobby%20Dodd">Bobby Dodd</a> () – made repeated calls for Carson's dismissal. The complaints were based on a long list of infractions, including "mistreating and humiliating students" and "unsportsmanlike conduct", but the most important issue was his record. The last straw was his season in 1971, which included both a loss to Georgia Tech's <a href="Clean%2C%20Old-Fashioned%20Hate">longtime rival</a>, the <a href="Georgia%20Bulldogs">Georgia Bulldogs</a>, and to the <a href="Mississippi%20State%20Bulldogs">Mississippi State Bulldogs</a> in the 1971 <a href="Peach%20Bowl">Peach Bowl</a>. As institute president, Boyd chaired the Board of Directors of the <a href="Georgia%20Tech%20Athletic%20Association">Georgia Tech Athletic Association</a>, which had been suffering both in win percentage and in finances.

Traditional sources of Athletic Association income, primarily ticket sales, had declined as a result of both the Yellow Jackets' poor record and the relatively recent establishment of professional football in Atlanta, namely the <a href="Atlanta%20Falcons">Atlanta Falcons</a>. Bobby Dodd, then <a href="athletic%20director">athletic director</a>, had warned for years that Georgia Tech's rising academic standards and its limited curriculum would affect the athletic program. At a meeting on January 8, 1972, the Athletic Association board, led by Boyd, ignored a 42-page list of "charges" drafted by an alumnus, but nevertheless voted to not renew Carson's contract, making him the first Georgia Tech coach to be fired. The board also voted to not accept Bobby Dodd's resignation, which had been offered at the meeting. Carson went on to have a successful career, particularly with the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>. On January 21, 1972, Boyd announced that <a href="Bill%20Fulcher">Bill Fulcher</a> had been selected as the new football head coach. This would not change the Georgia Tech Athletic Association's fortunes, however; after Carson's departure, the on-field and financial problems remained.

<a href="Joseph%20M.%20Pettit">Joseph M. Pettit</a> was selected as the next president of Georgia Tech in March 1972, after which Boyd returned to his position as vice chancellor for academic development for the University System of Georgia. Boyd retired from professional life in 1974. Upon retirement, he was named an honorary member of Georgia Tech's <a href="ANAK%20Society">ANAK Society</a>.

In 1997, the Georgia Board of Regents approved the naming and dedication of the math and physics building at the University of West Georgia as the "James E. Boyd Building". Two scholarships were created in his honor at the University of West Georgia; one for the top geology student, and one for a graduate of <a href="Bremen%20High%20School%20%28Georgia%29">Bremen High School</a>. Boyd died at the age of 91 on February 18, 1998, at his home in <a href="Carrollton%2C%20Georgia">Carrollton, Georgia</a>. The funeral was on February 20, 1998, at St. Margaret's Episcopal Church in Carrollton, Georgia, and he was interred at Carrollton City Cemetery, Georgia.

Hurricane Debbie (1961)

Hurricane Debbie is the most powerful <a href="Low-pressure%20area">cyclone</a> on record to strike <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> in September, and possibly the only <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> on record to ever strike Britain and Ireland while still tropical. The fourth <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%23Tropical%20storm">named storm</a> of the <a href="1961%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1961 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, Debbie originated from a well-defined tropical disturbance that was first identified in late August over Central Africa. Tracking generally westward, the system moved off the coast of <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a> on September 5 into the Atlantic Ocean. By this time, it was estimated to have become a tropical storm, but forecasters did not issue advisories on the system until two days later. Late on September 6, Debbie passed through the southern <a href="Cape%20Verde%20Islands">Cape Verde Islands</a> as a strong tropical storm or minimal hurricane, resulting in a plane crash that killed 60 people in the islands. Once clear of the islands, data on the storm became sparse, and the status of Debbie was uncertain over the following several days as it tracked west-northwestward and later northward. It was not until a commercial airliner intercepted the storm on September 10 that its location became certain. The following day, Debbie intensified and reached its peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane on the <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20hurricane%20scale">Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale</a>, with maximum winds of 120 mph (195 km/h).

Maintaining its peak intensity for over a day, the hurricane gradually slowed its forward motion and weakened. By September 13, Debbie's motion became influenced by the <a href="Westerlies">Westerlies</a>, causing the system to accelerate east-northeastward. The system passed over the western <a href="Azores">Azores</a> as a minimal hurricane on September 15. At this point, there is uncertainty as to the structure of Debbie, whether it transitioned into an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> or maintained its identity as a tropical system. Regardless of which took place, the system deepened as it neared Ireland, skirting the coast of Western Ireland on September 16. Shortly thereafter, the system was confirmed to have become extratropical as it continued towards the northeast. The remnants of the storm later turned eastward, striking Norway and Russia, before dissipating on September 19.

Striking Ireland as a powerful storm, Debbie brought record winds to much of the island, with a peak gust of measured just offshore. These winds caused widespread damage and disruption, downing tens of thousands of trees and power lines. Countless structures sustained varying degrees of damage, with many smaller buildings destroyed. Agriculture experienced extensive losses to barley, corn and wheat crops. Throughout Ireland, Debbie killed 18 people (12 in the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> and six in <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>). It caused <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>40–50 million in damage in the Republic and at least <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>1.5 million (US$4 million) in Northern Ireland. The storm also battered parts of <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> with winds in excess of .

During late August and into early September 1961, an unusual series of low-level disturbances developed over Central and West Africa and into the eastern Atlantic Ocean. One of these systems, that probably formed over Central Africa at the end of August, became increasingly organized as it moved over <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> on September 1. As the disturbance travelled steadily westward, its <a href="Low-pressure%20area">mid-level circulation</a> became well defined, and the accompanying low-level centre gradually followed suit. An upper-level <a href="anticyclone">anticyclone</a> accompanied the storm during this entire period, providing a favorable upper-air regime for strengthening. According to a post-storm study in 1962, all the necessary environmental ingredients were available to the disturbance while it was over land; the only factor inhibiting earlier development was a lack of access to the warm waters. Around 1200 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> on September 5, the low emerged off the coast of <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a> as a strong tropical depression or tropical storm. By this time, the system had a central pressure below 1006 <a href="Bar%20%28unit%29">mbar</a> (<a href="Pascal%20%28unit%29">hPa</a>; 29.71 <a href="Inches%20of%20Mercury">inHg</a>), and sustained winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) were reported in <a href="Bissau%2C%20Guinea-Bissau">Bissau, Guinea-Bissau</a>. As the system neared <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a>, it continued to intensify and by the evening of September 6, reports from the nearby Danish tanker "Charlotte Maersk" indicated that the system was already at or near hurricane intensity.

Late on September 6, Debbie passed over the southern Cape Verde Islands as a strong tropical storm or low-end hurricane. Continuing on a west-northwest path, mainly in response to a large <a href="High-pressure%20area">area of high pressure</a> over the eastern Atlantic, the system continued to intensify. <a href="Sea%20surface%20temperature">Sea surface temperature</a>s in the region averaged , supportive of tropical development. At 1913 UTC on September 7, a picture from <a href="Television%20Infrared%20Observation%20Satellite">TIROS-3</a> showed that an <a href="Eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> had already developed and <a href="rainband">banding features</a> covered an area more than from the centre. Debbie was not classified operationally as a tropical storm until 2200 UTC on September 7, at which time the centre was estimated to be about west-southwest of <a href="Sal%2C%20Cape%20Verde">Sal Island</a>. Over the following three days, virtually no data was available on the hurricane and no reliable estimates on its intensity could be made. During this time, the storm was estimated to have taken a more north-westerly course over the open ocean. It was not until a <a href="KLM">KLM</a> flight encountered the storm on September 10 that an accurate positioning of the hurricane could be made.
After maintaining a nearly steady course for three days, Hurricane Debbie turned northward and slowed as it neared a break in the ridge previously steering it west-northwestward. During the evening of September 11, a <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> <a href="Hurricane%20Hunter">Aircraft reconnaissance</a> mission into the storm found sustained winds of 110 – 120 mph (175 – 195 km/h) and a central pressure of 976 mbar (hPa; 28.82 inHg), reaching its peak intensity as a modern-day <a href="SSHS%23Category%203">Category 3 hurricane</a> on the <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20hurricane%20scale">Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale</a> with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). After maintaining its windspeeds for over 24 hours, the system weakened and turned sharply towards the east-northeast in response to the upper-level <a href="westerlies">westerlies</a>. By the afternoon of September 13, Debbie was again a Category 1 storm as it quickly accelerated towards the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>. Early on September 15, the storm passed over the easternmost Azores with winds estimated at 80 mph (130 km/h) before turning more northeasterly. Once past the Azores, there is an uncertainty over the structural changes that took place with Debbie. According to the United States <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">Weather Bureau</a>'s preliminary report, the system acquired characteristics of an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> on September 15, though remained a strong system. This conflicts with the best track supplied by the Bureau and the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a>'s <a href="HURDAT">hurricane database</a> maintains the system as a tropical cyclone until the afternoon of September 16.

The system moved towards Ireland and began to deepen. Debbie eventually brushed the coast of Western <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> near <a href="Achill%20Island">Achill Island</a> during the morning of September 16 with sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Around this time, a pressure of was measured as it passed near <a href="Belmullet">Belmullet</a>. If the system maintained tropical characteristics at this time, it would have been the first such storm on record to strike Ireland. Shortly after striking Ireland, the system was confirmed to have transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it re-emerged into the northeast Atlantic Ocean. While passing between Ireland and Scotland, the system continued to deepen, achieving an estimated central pressure of . According to a study by Hickey and Connolly-Johnston, this ranked Debbie as the most intense post-hurricane from 1960 to 2012 to move through the Britain and Ireland. After clearing the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the hurricane's remnants turned more easterly, later impacting <a href="Norway">Norway</a> and <a href="Russia">Russia</a> before dissipating on September 19.

As early as September 13, residents were made aware that a storm might strike parts of Ireland with hurricane-force winds. Two days later, forecasters believed the storm would take a more southerly course towards <a href="France">France</a>. This forecast was later withdrawn as the storm failed to turn eastward. Consequently, gale warnings were issued for much of western Ireland on the morning of September 16, hours before the brunt of the storm arrived. Fearing building collapses, officials in <a href="County%20Galway">County Galway</a> closed markets for the duration of the storm.

A powerful tropical or extratropical cyclone, on September 16 Hurricane Debbie became one of the most intense storms on record to strike Ireland. The storm brought hurricane-force winds to a large part of the country, with wind gusts peaking at off the coast of <a href="Arranmore">Arranmore</a>. At several locations, all-time wind gusts and ten-minute sustained wind records were broken. Sustained winds at Malin Head stayed at or above for approximately six hours. Debbie was the strongest storm, in terms of atmospheric pressure, to strike Belmullet during the month of September, with a pressure of 961.4 mbar (hPa; 28.39 inHg) measured in Belmullet. Rainfall from the storm was relatively minor, with rainfall rates peaking at per hour at the Valentia Observatory. Though limited, the rain did cause some lakes in the west to flood.

The greatest damage occurred in a swath stretching from <a href="County%20Kerry">Kerry</a> to <a href="Limerick">Limerick</a> as well as the counties of <a href="County%20Sligo">Sligo</a> and <a href="County%20Donegal">Donegal</a>. In these areas, the hurricane's powerful winds damaged or destroyed many buildings and downed trees and power lines. In the hardest hit areas, communication was not restored for over four days. Many roads were blocked by debris for up to two days. Crops and trees were badly damaged. Approximately two percent of the trees in the forestry industry were snapped or uprooted, with some areas losing up to twenty-four percent. In general, <a href="Maize">corn</a> and wheat crops fared better than expected, with only 25–30 percent being lost; however, some farmers reported <a href="barley">barley</a> losses greater than 50 percent. Downed trees from the storm wreaked havoc, leaving considerable damage and loss of life behind. All told, Hurricane Debbie was responsible for 12 deaths in the Republic of Ireland. Four people were killed in <a href="County%20Cavan">County Cavan</a> – a widow, her two daughters and granddaughter – after a tree fell on their car. Five deaths resulted from fallen trees and three others were from building collapses. At least 50 people were injured, few of which were serious. A study in 2012 estimated that damage from the storm was at least US$40–50 million across Ireland.
Newspapers reported that the city of <a href="Galway">Galway</a> "resembled a bombed area," referring to the scale of damage caused by the winds. In nearby <a href="Ballygar">Ballygar</a>, two barns were destroyed, one of which had debris strewn over a wide area. Hurricane-force winds battered <a href="Tuam">Tuam</a> for several hours, leaving most buildings damaged. Nearly every structure in <a href="Connemara">Connemara</a> was damaged and many homes lost their roofs. At <a href="Cork%20Airport">Cork Airport</a>, windows at the control tower were blown out and a construction crane was knocked over. Residents in <a href="Loughrea">Loughrea</a> dubbed Saturday, September 16, 1961 as "The Day Of The Big Wind" in light of the extensive damage. Damage in <a href="Roscommon">Roscommon</a> was "impossible to calculate," as all power and communication around the town was lost. In Limerick, 15 people were injured. Across County Cavan, thousands of trees were snapped or uprooted, leaving many towns temporarily cut off as roads were blocked and communications lost. Many structures sustained damage, which ranged from broken slate roofing to flattened barns. Most towns across the county were left without power and telephone service. Residents described the storm as "the worst in living memory."

Along the coast, rough seas spurred by the winds damaged docks and flooded some coastal regions. Offshore, waves reached heights of near Arranmore. Dozens of ships were torn from their moorings and run aground at various ports, some of which were found inland. In <a href="Salthill">Salthill</a>, three marinas were damaged with forty vessels damaged or sunk. Between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. local time, onshore winds from the storm caused the <a href="River%20Shannon">River Shannon</a> to flow backwards and rise . Hundreds of acres of land, including potato and cabbage plots, were left several feet underwater. Many roads were submerged, making travel impossible in the area. The combination of strong winds and <a href="sea%20spray">sea spray</a> from the storm caused extensive defoliation of vegetation up to inland. Spray from the <a href="River%20Foyle">River Foyle</a> reportedly travelled .

In the wake of the storm, more than 1,000 <a href="ESB%20Group">Electricity Supply Board (ESB)</a> personnel were deployed to restore power. In some areas, locals worked together to provide others with fresh food after electricity was lost. Fire brigades were sent on patrol to quell any looting. In Galway, ESB repair crews worked through labor and supply shortages to restore power and telephone service despite recent strikes in the company. By September 23, officials in the city appealed to <a href="Government%20of%20Ireland">the Government</a> for funding to deal with the aftermath of the hurricane. Uncertainty over whether some of the cost could be footed by landowners themselves resulted in disagreement over how much aid to request. Due to the severity of damage to the electrical grid, there were numerous requests made to the ESB to build underground power cables, especially in Galway.

Exceptionally strong winds from the storm buffeted parts of <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, with gusts of and measured in <a href="Ballykelly%2C%20County%20Londonderry">Ballykelly</a> and <a href="Tiree">Tiree</a> respectively. The winds downed tens of thousands of trees and more than 1,000 telephone lines across the region. In the Baronscourt Forest in <a href="County%20Tyrone">County Tyrone</a>, 30,000 trees were blown down. Countless roads across Northern Ireland were blocked by debris and major rail lines had to suspend service. There was severe damage in the city of <a href="Derry">Derry</a> where a newly built school was destroyed. Losses in the city alone amounted to <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>500,000 (US$1.4 million). In <a href="Lagan%20Valley">Lagan Valley</a>, a brick community hall was destroyed. An estimated 200 homes and two churches in <a href="Strabane">Strabane</a> were damaged. The town's labour exchange building was severely damaged as well. In a local cemetery, many tombstones were uprooted from concrete foundations and destroyed. A newly built fire station in <a href="Clogher">Clogher</a> collapsed after its roof was blown off. Several people were injured in <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a> after a glass ceiling collapsed in a bus station and a piece of corrugated roofing blew in from a nearby building.

Six people were killed in Northern Ireland, mostly due to fallen trees: two in <a href="County%20Fermanagh">County Fermanagh</a> and one each in <a href="Cookstown">Cookstown</a>, <a href="Dungannon">Dungannon</a>, <a href="Omagh">Omagh</a>, and elsewhere in Tyrone. The cereal crop in Northern Ireland suffered greatly due to Debbie, with half of the yield being lost. Losses from the crop were estimated at £1 million (US$2.8 million). In the wake of the storm, military ambulances from the <a href="Royal%20Army%20Medical%20Corps">Royal Army Medical Corps</a> were dispatched to parts of West Tyrone. Power repair crews were dispatched for nearly a week repairing downed wires across Northern Ireland. Many public authorities paid tribute to the workers for their tireless work. After passing through Ireland, the storm brought strong winds and heavy rain to parts of Scotland and <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, resulting in some damage and flooding in the region. On the coast of <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> and the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>, <a href="sand%20storm">sand storm</a>s were reported, with significant sand deposits found inland.

Unsettled weather in the Cape Verde Islands brought about by Tropical Storm Debbie was blamed for a plane crash on September 6 that killed 60 people. Strong winds were also reported from the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a> to locations in northern Norway.

<doc id="26770213" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26770213" title="Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia">
Section 116 of the Constitution of Australia

Section 116 of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Australia">Constitution of Australia</a> precludes the Commonwealth of Australia ("i.e.", the federal parliament) from making laws for establishing any religion, imposing any religious observance, or prohibiting the free exercise of any religion. Section 116 also provides that no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. The product of a compromise in the pre-<a href="Federation%20of%20Australia">Federation</a> constitutional conventions, Section 116 is based on similar provisions in the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>. However, Section 116 is more narrowly drafted than its US counterpart, and does not preclude the <a href="States%20and%20territories%20of%20Australia">states of Australia</a> from making such laws.

Section 116 has been interpreted narrowly by the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Court of Australia</a>: while the definition of "religion" adopted by the court is broad and flexible, the scope of the protection of religions is circumscribed. The result of the court's approach has been that no court has ever ruled a law to be in contravention of Section 116, and the provision has played only a minor role in <a href="Constitutional%20history%20of%20Australia">Australian constitutional history</a>. Among the laws that the High Court has ruled not to be in contravention of Section 116 are laws that provided government funding to religious schools, that authorised the <a href="Adelaide%20Company%20of%20Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses%20v%20Commonwealth">dissolution of a branch of the Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, and that enabled the forcible removal of <a href="Indigenous%20Australian">Indigenous Australian</a> children from their families.

<a href="Federal%20Government%20of%20Australia">Federal Governments</a> have twice proposed the amendment of Section 116, principally to apply its provisions to laws made by the states. On each occasion—in <a href="Australian%20referendum%2C%201944">1944</a> and <a href="Australian%20referendum%2C%201988%20%28Rights%20and%20Freedoms%29">1988</a>—the proposal failed in a referendum.

Section 116 states:

The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.

Section 116 has four limbs. The first three limbs prohibit the Commonwealth from making certain laws: laws "for establishing any religion"; laws "for imposing any religious observance"; and laws "for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion". The fourth limb proscribes the imposition of religious tests to qualify for any Commonwealth office or public trust. Only the "establishing religion" and "prohibiting free exercise" limbs have been the subject of cases before the High Court.

The section sits in Chapter V of the Constitution, which deals with the states of Australia. However, Section 116 does not apply to the states. Each state has its own constitution, and only Tasmania's has a provision similar to Section 116. Commentators attribute the erroneous location of Section 116 to a drafting oversight caused by the weariness of the committee charged with finalising the draft Constitution.

The Constitution was the product of a series of constitutional conventions in the 1890s. The issues of religious freedom and secularism were not prominent in the convention debates, which focused on the economic and legislative powers of the proposed Commonwealth parliament. The first draft of Section 116, approved by the Melbourne Convention of 1891, would have prohibited the states from passing laws prohibiting the free exercise of religion. The Commonwealth was not mentioned because it was assumed that the Commonwealth parliament would have no power to make such laws. At the Melbourne Convention of 1897, Victorian delegate <a href="H.%20B.%20Higgins">H. B. Higgins</a> expressed concern about this assumption and moved to expand the provision to cover the Commonwealth as well as the states. The amendment was initially defeated, but Higgins later succeeded in having the eventual version of Section 116 adopted by the convention in a 25–16 vote. Higgins feared opposition to the provision from convention delegates concerned that the provision would impede the states' legislative powers, so the version passed by the convention did not mention the states.

The proposed inclusion of Section 116 in the Constitution was the subject of some dissent in the 1897 Melbourne Convention and the final convention in 1898. Protestant churches in New South Wales argued that the Constitution should state that divine providence is the "ultimate source of law", while convention delegates <a href="John%20Quick%20%28politician%29">John Quick</a> and <a href="Patrick%20Glynn">Patrick Glynn</a> moved to have God explicitly recognised in the Constitution. The <a href="Seventh-day%20Adventist%20Church">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a> campaigned for a strict separation of church and state, being concerned that the Commonwealth might prohibit its members from working on Sundays. Both sides to some extent achieved their objectives: Section 116 was approved by the final convention, while Glynn successfully moved for the symbolic mention of "Almighty God" in the preamble to the British statute that was to contain the Constitution. The Constitution was then approved by popular referendums in each of the six colonies and took effect on 1 January 1901 (the colonies thus became the states of Australia).

Section 116 reflects two provisions of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>: the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a>, which prohibits the making of laws for the establishment of religion and guarantees the free exercise of religion; and <a href="Article%20Six%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Article VI</a>, Section 3, which <a href="No%20religious%20test%20clause">prohibits the imposition of religious tests</a> for public offices. Academic Clifford L. Pannam, writing in 1963, called Section 116 a "fairly blatant piece of transcription" of its US counterparts. However, in practice, Section 116 has been interpreted more narrowly than the US provisions.

The High Court's consideration of Section 116 has generally been limited to three areas: the definition of "religion"; the meaning of "law for establishing any religion"; and the meaning of "law for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion". The two other elements of the provision—the clauses prohibiting the Commonwealth from imposing of religious observance and from prescribing religious tests for public offices—have not been the subject of any cases before the court. The court has never ruled a legislative provision to be in contravention of Section 116. As a result of the court's narrow and literal interpretation of Section 116, the provision has played a minor role in Australian constitutional history.

A threshold test considered by courts applying Section 116 is whether a belief seeking constitutional protection is a "religion". The leading authority on the question is the 1983 judgment of the High Court in "Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic)". The court found that <a href="Scientology">Scientology</a> was a religion, despite some justices commenting that its practices were "impenetrably obscure". In reaching this finding, the court argued that the definition of religion needed to be flexible but should recognise the need to be sceptical of disingenous claims of religious practice. Justices <a href="Anthony%20Mason%20%28judge%29">Anthony Mason</a> and <a href="Gerard%20Brennan">Gerard Brennan</a> held:

... the criteria of religion [are] twofold: first, belief in a supernatural, Being, Thing or Principle; and second, the acceptance of canons of conduct in order to give effect to that belief.

Justices <a href="Ronald%20Wilson">Ronald Wilson</a> and <a href="William%20Deane">William Deane</a> were less prescriptive, setting out five "indicia" of a religion: a belief in the supernatural; a belief in ideas relating to "man's nature and place in the universe"; the adherence to particular standards, codes of conduct or practices by those who hold the ideas; the existence of an identifiable group of believers, even if not a formal organisation; and the opinion of the believers that what they believe in constitutes a religion.

The courts have taken a narrow approach to the interpretation of the prohibition against "establishing any religion", deriving from the 1981 case of "<a href="Attorney-General%20%28Vic%29%20%28Ex%20rel%20Black%29%20v%20Commonwealth">Attorney-General (Vic) (Ex rel Black) v Commonwealth</a>" (the "DOGS" case), in which the High Court held that Commonwealth funding of religious schools did not contravene Section 116. Chief Justice <a href="Garfield%20Barwick">Garfield Barwick</a> held that a law would only contravene the provision if establishing a religion was its "express and single purpose", while Justice <a href="Harry%20Gibbs">Harry Gibbs</a> argued that the section only prohibits the establishment of an official state religion. Each justice in the majority contrasted Section 116 with its equivalent in the US Constitution to find that Section 116 is narrower. The court noted that the US Constitution prohibits laws respecting "establishment of religion" generally, whereas the prohibition in Section 116 is against the establishment of ""any" religion": this meant that Section 116 did not encompass laws that benefit religions generally; it only proscribed laws that established a particular religion. The approach of the High Court to the establishment limb of Section 116 thus largely reflects the views expressed by Constitutional scholars <a href="John%20Quick%20%28politician%29">John Quick</a> and <a href="Robert%20Garran">Robert Garran</a> in 1901, that establishment means "the erection and recognition of a State Church, or the concession of special favours, titles, and advantages to one church which are denied to others."

The protection of the free exercise of religion was also interpreted narrowly in early High Court judgments. In 1912, the court in "Krygger v Williams", held that a person could not object to compulsory military service on the ground of religious belief. The court considered that Section 116 would only protect religious observance from government interference; it would not permit a person to be excused from a legal obligation merely because the obligation conflicted with his or her religious beliefs. In a 1929 case, Higgins, then a Justice of the High Court, suggested (as "<a href="obiter%20dictum">obiter dictum</a>") that a person could lawfully object to <a href="compulsory%20voting">compulsory voting</a> on the grounds of religious belief. However, in 1943, the court continued the narrow approach it took in "Krygger v Williams", upholding war-time regulations that caused the <a href="Adelaide%20Company%20of%20Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses%20v%20Commonwealth">Adelaide branch of the Jehovah's Witnesses</a> to be dissolved and have its property acquired by the Commonwealth government. The government had declared the branch to be an organisation whose activities were "prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth": one of the branch's professed beliefs was that the government was an "organ of <a href="Satan">Satan</a>". Chief Justice <a href="John%20Latham%20%28judge%29">John Latham</a> held that the Constitution permitted the court to "reconcile religious freedom with ordered government".

In a 1997 case known as the <a href="Kruger%20v%20Commonwealth">"Stolen Generations Case"</a>, the court upheld an ordinance issued in 1918 that enabled the forcible removal of <a href="Indigenous%20Australian">Indigenous Australian</a> children from their families. The court reasoned that the purpose of the ordinance was not to prohibit the free exercise of religion even though the ordinance may have had that effect. Peter Edge, an academic specialising in religion and the law, thus concludes that Section 116 will only "prevent legislation that has a prohibited purpose, rather than a prohibited effect". In her judgment, Gaudron J, while finding that the provision 'cannot be construed as impliedly conferring an independent or free-standing right which, if breached, sounds in damages at the suit of the individual whose interests are thereby affected' left open the possibility that it might nonetheless, in limiting Commonwealth legislative power, apply to a provision that has the effect, as opposed merely to the purpose, of limiting free exercise.

When the Constitution took effect in 1901, Quick and Garran argued that Section 116 was redundant as the Commonwealth had not been given the legislative power under <a href="Section%2051%20of%20the%20Australian%20Constitution">Section 51</a> to establish a religion or prohibit its free exercise. In 1963, Pannam wrote that the provision was regarded "by all as having little practical value". Pannam considered the provision would only become significant if the High Court held that it applied to laws made by governments of the territories.

Constitutional scholar <a href="George%20Williams%20%28lawyer%29">George Williams</a>, writing in 1994, criticised the court's literal interpretation of the provision and others in the Constitution, saying the court has "transformed the Constitution into a wasteland of civil liberties". Williams argues that as an "express guarantee of personal freedom", the provision should be interpreted broadly and promote "individual liberty over the arbitrary exercise of legislative and executive power". Academics Gonzalo Villalta Puig and Steven Tudor have called for the court to broaden Section 116 by finding in it an implied right to the freedom of thought and conscience. In their view most Australians correctly "believe that the Constitution protects the right to freedom of thought and conscience just like it protects other civil and political freedoms", and that the court should give effect to that belief. They argue there is precedent for the court finding implied constitutional rights, such as the 1992 case of "<a href="Australian%20Capital%20Television%20Pty%20Ltd%20v%20Commonwealth">Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth</a>", where the court found that the Constitution guaranteed the freedom of political communication.

In defence of Section 116 and the High Court's interpretation of it, Joshua Puls argues that the provision is appropriately limited, suggesting that a rigid "wall of separation" between religion and the state is undesirable, and that the stronger Constitutional protection of religion in the United States has become overly politicised. Fellow academics Jennifer Clarke, Patrick Keyzer and James Stellios argue that the court's narrow interpretation of the provision is consistent with the intention of the Constitution's drafters, who never intended for it to be a protection of individual rights, while Kevin Booker and Arthur Glass say the provision has "symbolic value". Booker and Glass defend the court's interpretation of the provision and other Constitutional rights, saying "the High Court can only work with the constitutional provisions before it".

Federal governments have twice proposed <a href="Referendums%20in%20Australia">referendums</a> to expand the scope of Section 116: in 1944 and in 1988. In 1944, <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a>'s <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labor</a> government put a package of measures, known as the "Fourteen Powers referendum", to the Australian public. The purpose of the package was mainly to widen the Commonwealth's legislative powers for the purposes of post-war reconstruction. The widening of powers would <a href="sunset%20provision">sunset</a> after five years. One of the measures in the package was to extend Section 116 so that it prohibited the states, not merely the Commonwealth, from making the laws proscribed by the section. The package's 14 measures—which included diverse matters such as powers to provide family allowances and legislate for "national health"—were bound together in a single question. <a href="H.%20V.%20Evatt">H. V. Evatt</a>, the Labor <a href="Attorney-General%20of%20Australia">Attorney-General</a>, argued that <a href="freedom%20of%20religion">freedom of religion</a> was "fundamental to the whole idea of democracy" and that the suppression of civil rights by dictatorships in Europe demonstrated the need for Australia to have a strong Constitutional guarantee of the freedom. The conservative <a href="United%20Australia%20Party">United Australia Party</a>, then in opposition and led by <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a>, campaigned against the package. <a href="Arthur%20Fadden">Arthur Fadden</a>, leader of the <a href="National%20Party%20of%20Australia">Country Party</a>, claimed a "yes" vote would permit the government to implement a "policy of socialisation". The package was rejected: the national "yes" vote was less than 46 per cent, and there was majority support for the package only in South Australia and Western Australia. One reason for the rejection was the bundling of multiple controversial proposals into one question: voters could not vote in favour of the measures they supported and against those they opposed, giving them reason to vote against the entire package.

A similar proposal to amend Section 116 was put to the Australian people in a referendum in 1988. The referendum contained four questions, the last of which sought to amend Section 116 and other constitutional "rights and freedoms". Again, the proposal was initiated by a Labor government (under <a href="Bob%20Hawke">Bob Hawke</a>); again, the proposal was opposed by the conservative parties; and again, multiple controversial proposals were bound into one question, being "to alter the Constitution to extend the right to trial by jury, to extend freedom of religion, and to ensure fair terms for persons whose property is acquired by any government." The proposal in respect of Section 116 was to extend its operation to the states, and expand the protection to cover any government act (not just legislation) that established a religion or prohibited its free exercise. Some church officials objected to the proposal, fearing that funding of religious schools by the states could become unlawful. The question failed to pass, being opposed by a majority of voters in each of the states. The 70 to 30 per cent nationwide vote against the proposal was the largest margin by which a proposal to amend the Constitution had ever been defeated at a referendum. Williams attributes the failure of the proposal mainly to the absence of bipartisan support for it, highlighting the "determined and effective" opposition of senior <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal Party</a> politician <a href="Peter%20Reith">Peter Reith</a>. Williams also points to the "notorious reluctance" of Australians to support Constitutional referendums: of the 44 proposals to amend the Constitution, only eight have succeeded.

The evolutionary history of <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s occurred in isolation from other <a href="primate">primate</a>s, on the island of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, for at least 40 million years. <a href="Lemur">Lemur</a>s are primates belonging to the suborder <a href="Strepsirrhini">Strepsirrhini</a>, which branched off from other primates less than 63 <a href="Year%23Symbols%20y%20and%20yr">mya</a> (million years ago). They share some traits with the most <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> primates, and thus are often confused as being ancestral to modern monkeys, apes, and humans. Instead, they merely resemble ancestral primates.

Lemurs are thought to have evolved during the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> or earlier, sharing a closest common ancestor with <a href="loris">loris</a>es, <a href="potto">potto</a>s, and <a href="galago">galago</a>s (<a href="Lorisoidea">lorisoids</a>). <a href="Fossil">Fossil</a>s from Africa and some tests of <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear DNA</a> suggest that lemurs made their way to Madagascar between 40 and 52 mya. Other mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence comparisons offer an alternative date range of 62 to 65 mya. An ancestral lemur population is thought to have inadvertently <a href="Oceanic%20dispersal">rafted</a> to the island on a floating mat of vegetation, although hypotheses for <a href="land%20bridge">land bridge</a>s and <a href="island%20hopping">island hopping</a> have also been proposed. The timing and number of hypothesized colonizations has traditionally hinged on the <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogenetic affinities</a> of the <a href="aye-aye">aye-aye</a>, the most basal member of the lemur <a href="clade">clade</a>.

Having undergone their own independent evolution on Madagascar, lemurs have diversified to fill many <a href="Ecological%20niche">niches</a> normally filled by other types of mammals. They include the smallest primates in the world, and once included some of the largest. Since the arrival of humans approximately 2,000 years ago, lemurs are now restricted to 10% of the island, or approximately , with many facing <a href="extinction">extinction</a>.

Lemurs are primates belonging to the suborder Strepsirrhini. Like other <a href="Strepsirrhini">strepsirrhine</a> primates, such as <a href="loris">loris</a>es, <a href="potto">potto</a>s, and <a href="galago">galago</a>s, they share <a href="Cladistics%23plesiomorphy">ancestral</a> traits with early primates. In this regard, lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates; however, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes, but evolved independently on Madagascar.

Primates first evolved sometime between the <a href="Cretaceous">Middle Cretaceous</a> and the early <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a> periods on either the <a href="supercontinent">supercontinent</a> of <a href="Laurasia">Laurasia</a> or in Africa. According to <a href="molecular%20clock">molecular clock</a> studies, the last common ancestor of all primates dates to around 79.6 mya, although the earliest known <a href="fossil">fossil</a> primates are only 54–55 million years old. The closest relatives of primates are the extinct <a href="Plesiadapiformes">plesiadapiforms</a>, the modern <a href="colugo">colugo</a>s (commonly and inaccurately named "flying lemurs"), and <a href="treeshrew">treeshrew</a>s. Some of the earliest known true primates are represented by the fossil groups <a href="Omomyidae">Omomyidae</a>, <a href="Eosimiidae">Eosimiidae</a>, and <a href="Adapiformes">Adapiformes</a>.

The relationship between known fossil primate families remains unclear. A conservative estimate for the divergence of <a href="Haplorhini">haplorhines</a> (<a href="tarsier">tarsier</a>s, <a href="monkey">monkey</a>s, <a href="ape">ape</a>s, and <a href="human">human</a>s) and strepsirrhines is 58 to 63 mya. A consensus is emerging that places omomyids as a <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a> to tarsiers, eosimids as a <a href="Crown%20group%23Stem%20groups">stem group</a> to <a href="simian">simian</a>s (non-tarsier haplorhines), and "<a href="Djebelemur">Djebelemur</a>", an African genus likely to be related to an early Asian branch of <a href="Cercamoniinae">cercamoniine</a> adapiforms, as a stem group to modern strepsirrhines, including lemurs. In 2009, a highly publicized and scientifically criticized publication proclaimed that a 47-million-year-old adapiform fossil, "<a href="Darwinius">Darwinius masillae</a>", demonstrated both adapiform and <a href="simian">simian</a> traits, making it a <a href="transitional%20form">transitional form</a> between the <a href="prosimian">prosimian</a> and <a href="simian">simian</a> lineages. Media sources inaccurately dubbed the fossil as a "missing link" between lemurs and humans.
Lemurs were traditionally thought to have evolved during the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> (55 to 37 mya) based on the fossil record, although molecular tests suggest the Paleocene (66 to 56 mya) or later. Until recently, they were thought to have descended directly from the diverse group of adapiforms due to several shared <a href="postcrania">postcrania</a>l traits, as well as long <a href="snout">snout</a>s and small <a href="brain">brain</a>s. Although adapiforms also had lemur-like <a href="auditory%20bulla">auditory bulla</a>e, a prosimian characteristic, they had smaller brains and longer snouts than lemurs. There are also several other <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> differences. Most noticeably, adapiforms lack a key <a href="Synapomorphy">derived</a> trait, the <a href="toothcomb">toothcomb</a>, and possibly the <a href="toilet-claw">toilet-claw</a>, found not only in <a href="Extant%20taxon">extant</a> (living) strepsirrhines but also in tarsiers. Unlike lemurs, adapiforms exhibited a fused <a href="mandibular%20symphysis">mandibular symphysis</a> (a characteristic of simians) and also possessed four <a href="premolar">premolar</a>s, instead of three or two.

Comparative studies of the <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome "b"</a> gene, which are frequently used to determine phylogenetic relationships among mammals—particularly within families and genera—have been used to show that lemurs share common ancestry with lorisoids. This conclusion is also corroborated by the shared strepsirrhine toothcomb, an unusual trait that is unlikely to have evolved twice. If adapiforms were the ancestors of the living strepsirrhines, then the last common ancestor of modern strepsirrhines would have to predate the early Eocene, a view supported by <a href="molecular%20phylogenetic">molecular phylogenetic</a> studies by <a href="Anne%20D.%20Yoder">Anne D. Yoder</a> and Ziheng Yang in 2004, which showed that lemurs split from lorises approximately 62 to 65 mya. These dates were confirmed by more extensive tests by Julie Horvath "et al". in 2008. These molecular studies also showed that lemuroids diversified before the modern lorisoids. Using a more limited data set and only <a href="nuclear%20gene">nuclear gene</a>s, another study in 2005 by Céline Poux "et al". dated the split between lemurs and lorises at 60 mya, lemur diversification at 50 mya, and the lemur colonization of Madagascar somewhere between these two approximate dates. However, the 2003 discovery of fossil lorisoids at the <a href="Fayum%20Depression">Fayum Depression</a> in Egypt pushed the date of lorisoid divergence back to the Eocene, matching the divergence dates predicted by Yoder and Horvath.

The <a href="fossil%20record">fossil record</a> tells a different story. Although it cannot show the earliest possible date for the appearance of a taxonomic group, other concerns have arisen about these vastly earlier divergence dates predicted independently of the fossil record. First, palaeontologists have expressed concerns that if primates have been around for significantly more than 66 million years, then the first one-third of the primate fossil record is missing. Another problem is that some of these molecular dates have overestimated the divergence of other mammalian orders, such as <a href="Rodent">Rodent</a>ia, suggesting primate divergence might also be overestimated. One of the oldest known strepsirrhines, "Djebelemur", dates from the early Eocene of northern Africa and lacks a fully differentiated toothcomb. Based on fossils and other genetic tests, a more conservative estimate dates the divergence between lemurs and lorises to around 50 to 55 mya.

To complicate the ancestry puzzle, no terrestrial Eocene or Paleocene <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s have been found on Madagascar, and the fossil record from both Africa and Asia around this time is not much better. Fossil sites in Madagascar are restricted to only five windows in time, which omit most of the <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a>, from 66 mya to ~26,000 years ago. What little fossil-bearing rock exists from this vast span of time is dominated by marine strata along the west coast. The oldest lemur fossils on Madagascar are actually <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a>s dating to the <a href="Late%20Pleistocene">Late Pleistocene</a>.

Once part of the supercontinent <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>, Madagascar broke away from eastern Africa, the likely source of the ancestral lemur population, about 160 mya and then from Antarctica between 80 and 130 mya. Initially, the island drifted south from where it split from Africa (around modern <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a>) until it reached its current position between 80 and 90 mya. Around that time, it split with India, leaving it isolated in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> and separated from nearby Africa by the <a href="Mozambique%20Channel">Mozambique Channel</a>, a deep channel with a minimum width of approximately . These separation dates and the estimated age of the primate lineage preclude any possibility that lemurs could have been on the island before Madagascar pulled away from Africa, an evolutionary process known as <a href="vicariance">vicariance</a>. In support of this, <a href="mammal">mammal</a>ian fossils on Madagascar from the Cretaceous (see <a href="Mesozoic%20mammals%20of%20Madagascar">Mesozoic mammals of Madagascar</a>) include <a href="Gondwanatheria">gondwanatheres</a> and other mammalian groups that would not have been ancestral to lemurs or the other <a href="endemic">endemic</a> mammals present on the island today.

With Madagascar already geographically isolated by the Paleocene and lemur diversification dating to the same time, an explanation was needed for how lemurs had made it to the island. In the 19th century, prior to the theory of <a href="continental%20drift">continental drift</a>, scientists including <a href="Philip%20Sclater">Philip Sclater</a>, <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Geoffroy%20Saint-Hilaire">Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire</a>, and <a href="Ernst%20Haeckel">Ernst Haeckel</a> suggested that Madagascar and India were once part of a southern continent—named <a href="Lemuria%20%28continent%29">Lemuria</a> by Sclater—that has since disappeared under the Indian Ocean. By the early 20th century, <a href="oceanic%20dispersal">oceanic dispersal</a> emerged as the most popular explanation for how lemurs reached the island. The idea first took shape under the anti-<a href="plate%20tectonics">plate tectonics</a> movement of the early 1900s, when renowned <a href="paleontologist">paleontologist</a> <a href="William%20Diller%20Matthew">William Diller Matthew</a> proposed the idea in his influential article "Climate and Evolution" in 1915. In the article, Matthew could only account for the presence of lemurs in Madagascar by "<a href="Oceanic%20dispersal">rafting</a>". In the 1940s, American paleontologist <a href="George%20Gaylord%20Simpson">George Gaylord Simpson</a> coined the term "sweepstakes dispersal" for such unlikely events.

As plate tectonics theory took hold, oceanic dispersal fell out of favor and was even considered by many researchers to be "miraculous" if it occurred. Despite the low likelihood of its occurrence, oceanic dispersal remains the most accepted explanation for numerous vertebrate colonizations of Madagascar, including that of the lemurs. Although unlikely, over long periods of time <a href="terrestrial%20animal">terrestrial animal</a>s can occasionally raft to remote islands on floating mats of tangled vegetation, which get flushed out to sea from major rivers by floodwaters.

Any extended ocean voyage without fresh water or food would prove difficult for a large, <a href="warm-blooded">warm-blooded</a> (homeothermic) mammal, but today many small, nocturnal species of lemur exhibit <a href="heterothermy">heterothermy</a>, which allows them to lower their <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> and become dormant while living off fat reserves. Such a trait in a small, nocturnal lemur ancestor would have facilitated the ocean voyage and could have been passed on to its descendants. However, this trait has not been observed in the closely related lorisoids studied to date, and could have evolved on Madagascar in response to the island's harsh environmental conditions.

Because only five terrestrial <a href="Mammal%20classification">orders of mammals</a> have made it to the island, each likely to have derived from a single colonization, and since these colonizations date to either the early <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> or the early <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>, the conditions for oceanic dispersal to Madagascar seem to have been better during two separate periods in the past. A report published in January 2010 supported this assumption by demonstrating that both Madagascar and Africa were south of their present-day positions around 60 mya, placing them in a different <a href="ocean%20gyre">ocean gyre</a> and reversing the strong current that presently flows away from Madagascar. The currents were even shown to be stronger than they are today, shortening the rafting time to approximately 30 days or less, making the crossing much easier for a small mammal. Over time, as the continental plates drifted northward, the currents gradually changed, and by 20 mya the window for oceanic dispersal had closed.

Since the 1970s, the rafting hypothesis has been called into question by claims that lemur family <a href="Cheirogaleidae">Cheirogaleidae</a> might be more closely related to the other Afro-Asian strepsirrhines than to the rest of the lemurs. This idea was initially based on similarities in behavior and <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a> morphology, although it gained support with the 2001 discovery of 30‑million-year-old "<a href="Bugtilemur">Bugtilemur</a>" in <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and the 2003 discovery of 40‑million-year-old "<a href="Karanisia">Karanisia</a>" in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. "Karanisia" is the oldest fossil found that bears a toothcomb, whereas "Bugtilemur" was thought to have a toothcomb, but also had even more similar molar morphology to "<a href="Cheirogaleus">Cheirogaleus</a>" (dwarf lemurs). If these relationships had been correct, the dates of these fossils would have had implications on the colonization of Madagascar, requiring two separate events. The most <a href="Occam%27s%20razor">parsimonious explanation</a>, given the genetic evidence and the absence of toothcombed primates in European fossil sites, is that <a href="Crown%20group">stem</a> strepsirrhines evolved on the Afro-Arabian landmass, dispersing to Madagascar and more recently from Africa to Asia. More recently, the structure and general presence of the toothcomb in "Bugtilemur" has been questioned, as well as many other dental features, suggesting it is most likely an adapiform.

An alternative form of oceanic dispersal that had been considered was <a href="island%20hopping">island hopping</a>, where the lemur ancestors might have made it to Madagascar in small steps by colonizing exposed <a href="seamount">seamount</a>s during times of low sea level. However, this is unlikely since the only seamounts found along the <a href="Davie%20Ridge">Davie Ridge</a> would have been too small in such a wide channel. Even though the <a href="Comoro%20Islands">Comoro Islands</a> between Africa and Madagascar are significantly larger, they are too young, having been formed by volcanic activity only around 8 mya. A <a href="land%20bridge">land bridge</a> between Madagascar and Africa has also been proposed, but a land bridge would have facilitated the migration of a much greater sampling of Africa's mammalian fauna than is endemic to the island. Furthermore, deep trenches separate Madagascar from the mainland, and prior to the Oligocene, sea level was significantly higher than today.

A variant of the land bridge hypothesis has been proposed in an attempt to explain both how a land bridge could have formed, and why other mammalian orders failed to cross it. Geological studies have shown that following the collision of India and Asia, the <a href="Davie%20Fracture%20Zone">Davie Fracture Zone</a> had been pushed up by tectonic forces, possibly high enough to create a land bridge. Indeed, <a href="core%20sample">core sample</a>s along the Davie Fracture Zone suggest that at least parts of the Mozambique Channel were above sea level between 45 and 26 mya, or possibly as early as 55 mya. Following the Indian-Asian collision, the <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29">fault</a> type changed from a <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29%23Fault%20types">strike-slip fault to a normal fault</a>, and <a href="seafloor%20spreading">seafloor spreading</a> created compression along the Davie Fracture Zone, causing it to rise. By the early Miocene, the <a href="East%20African%20Rift">East African Rift</a> created tension along the fault, causing it to subside beneath the ocean. The divergence dates of many Malagasy mammalian orders formerly fell within this window. <a href="Old%20World%20monkey">Old World monkey</a>s, dogs, and cats did not diverge or arrive in Africa until later in the Miocene. However, more recent dating of divergence of the Malagasy mammalian clades falls outside of this land bridge window, and a much greater diversity of mammal groups would be expected on Madagascar had the land bridge been present during that stretch of time.

The dating of the lemur colonization is controversial for the same reasons as strepsirrhine evolution. Using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences, a single colonization has been estimated at 62 to 65 mya based on the split between the <a href="aye-aye">aye-aye</a> and the rest of the lemurs. On the other hand, the sparse fossil record and some estimates based on other nuclear genes support a more recent estimate of 40 to 52 mya. Furthermore, a fossil strepsirrhine primate from Africa, "<a href="Plesiopithecus">Plesiopithecus</a>", may suggest that the aye-aye and the rest of the lemurs diverged in Africa, which would require at least two colonization events.

Once safely established on Madagascar, with its limited mammalian population, the lemurs were protected from the increasing competition from evolving <a href="Arboreal%20locomotion">arboreal</a> mammalian groups. <a href="Monkey">Monkey</a>s had evolved by the <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a>, and their intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness may have given them the advantage in exploiting the environment over the <a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a> adapiform primates in Africa and Asia, ultimately driving them to <a href="extinction">extinction</a> and leaving only the <a href="Nocturnality">nocturnal</a> lorisoids.

The ancestral lemur that colonized Madagascar is thought to have been small and nocturnal. More specifically, it is thought to have had adapiform-like <a href="skull">cranial</a> anatomy—particularly the <a href="Foramina%20of%20the%20skull">cranial foramina</a> and the <a href="middle%20ear">middle ear</a>—comparable to that of <a href="Lemuridae">lemurids</a>, while being similar to <a href="Cheirogaleidae">cheirogaleids</a> in <a href="dentition">dentition</a> and <a href="Postcrania">postcranial anatomy</a>.

Nothing definitive is known about the island's <a href="biogeography">biogeography</a> at the time of the colonization, however, the <a href="Paleoclimatology">paleoclimate</a> (ancient weather patterns) may have been affected by Madagascar's location below the <a href="subtropical%20ridge">subtropical ridge</a> at 30° S latitude and disruption of the weather patterns by India as it drifted northward. Both would have created a drying effect on Madagascar, and as a result, the <a href="Madagascar%20spiny%20thickets">arid spiny bush</a> that is currently found in the south and southwest of Madagascar would have dominated the island. This would have placed strong <a href="Evolutionary%20pressure">selection pressure</a> for <a href="drought%20tolerance">drought tolerance</a> on the inhabitants of the island between the Cretaceous and the Eocene. As Madagascar edged above the subtropical ridge and India moved closer to Asia, the climate became less dry and the arid spiny bush retreated to the south and southwest.

Lemurs have diversified greatly since first reaching Madagascar. The aye-aye and its extinct relations are thought to have diverged first, shortly after colonization. According to molecular studies, there have since been two major episodes of diversification, from which all other known <a href="Extant%20taxon">extant</a> and extinct family lineages emerged. The remaining families diverged in the first diversification episode, during a 10 to 12 million-year window between the Late Eocene (42 mya) and into the Oligocene (30 mya). The dates for this divergence window span the <a href="Eocene%E2%80%93Oligocene%20extinction%20event">Eocene–Oligocene extinction event</a>, during which time climate cooling took place and changes in ocean currents altered weather patterns. Outside of Madagascar, these dates also coincide with the divergence of the lorisoid primates and five major clades of squirrels, all occupying niches similar to those of lemurs. The dates do not suggest that increased <a href="predation">predation</a> drove family-level divergence since the first carnivores arrived on the island between 24 and 18 mya. The precise relationship between the four of the five families of lemurs is disputed since they diverged during this narrow and distant window. Although all studies place Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae as a sister clade to Indriidae and Lemuridae, some suggest that Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae diverged first, while others suggest that Indriidae and Lemuridae were the first to branch off.

The second major episode of diversification occurred during the Late Miocene, approximately 8 to 12 mya, and included the <a href="true%20lemur">true lemur</a>s ("Eulemur") and the <a href="mouse%20lemur">mouse lemur</a>s ("Microcebus"). This event coincided with the beginning of the Indian <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a>s, the last major change in climate to affect Madagascar. The populations of both the true lemurs and mouse lemurs were thought to have diverged due to <a href="habitat%20fragmentation">habitat fragmentation</a> when humans arrived on the island roughly 2,000 years ago. Only recently has molecular research shown a more distant split in these genera. Most surprising were the mouse lemurs, a group which is now thought to contain <a href="Cryptic%20species%20complex">cryptic species</a>, meaning they are indistinguishable from each other based solely on appearance. In contrast, true lemurs are easier to distinguish and exhibit <a href="sexual%20dichromatism">sexual dichromatism</a>. Studies in <a href="Karyotype">karyology</a>, molecular genetics, and <a href="Biogeography">biogeographic patterns</a> have also assisted in understanding their phylogeny and diversification. Although the divergence estimates for these two genera are imprecise, they overlap with a change to a wetter climate in Madagascar, as new weather patterns generated <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a>s and likely influenced the plant life.

This difference in evolutionary divergence between the two genera may be due to differences in their activity patterns. True lemurs are often <a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a>, allowing potential mates to distinguish each other as well as other related species visually. Mouse lemurs, on the other hand, are <a href="Nocturnality">nocturnal</a>, reducing their ability to use visual signals for <a href="Mating">mate selection</a>. Instead, they use <a href="Olfaction">olfactory</a> and <a href="Sound">auditory</a> signaling. For these reasons, true lemurs may have evolved <a href="sexual%20dichromatism">sexual dichromatism</a> while mouse lemurs evolved to be cryptic species.

Since their arrival on Madagascar, lemurs have diversified both in behavior and morphology. Their diversity rivals that of the monkeys and apes found throughout the rest of the world, especially when the recently extinct <a href="subfossil%20lemur">subfossil lemur</a>s are considered. Ranging in size from the <a href="Madame%20Berthe%27s%20mouse%20lemur">Madame Berthe's mouse lemur</a>, the world's smallest primate, to the extinct "<a href="Archaeoindris%20fontoynonti">Archaeoindris fontoynonti</a>", lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion, varying levels of social complexity, and unique adaptations to the local climate. They went on to fill many niches normally occupied by monkeys, <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>s, <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a>s, and large grazing <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a>s. In addition to the incredible diversity between lemur families, there has also been great diversification among closely related lemurs. Yet despite separation by <a href="allopatric%20speciation">geographical barriers</a> or by <a href="Resource%20partitioning">niche differentiation</a> in <a href="sympatry">sympatry</a>, occasionally <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridization</a> can occur. Lemur diversification has also created <a href="Generalist%20and%20specialist%20species">generalist species</a>, such as the true lemurs of northern Madagascar, which are very adaptable, mostly nondescript, and found throughout most of the island's forests.

Most of the 99 living lemur taxa are found only on Madagascar. Two species, the <a href="common%20brown%20lemur">common brown lemur</a> ("Eulemur fulvus") and the <a href="mongoose%20lemur">mongoose lemur</a> ("Eulemur mongoz"), can also be found on the <a href="Comoro%20Islands">Comoro Islands</a>, although it is assumed that both species were introduced to the islands from northwestern Madagascar by humans within the last few hundred years. Molecular studies on "Eulemur fulvus fulvus" (from the mainland) and "E. f. mayottensis" (from the Comoro Islands) and on Comoro and mainland mongoose lemurs have supported this assumption by showing no genetic differences between the two populations. Because all lemurs, including these two brown lemur species, are only native to the island of Madagascar, they are considered to be <a href="endemic">endemic</a>.

Historically, lemurs ranged across the entire island inhabiting a <a href="Geography%20of%20Madagascar">wide variety of habitats</a>, including <a href="Madagascar%20dry%20deciduous%20forests">dry deciduous forests</a>, <a href="Madagascar%20lowland%20forests">lowland forests</a>, <a href="Madagascar%20spiny%20thickets">spiny thickets</a>, <a href="Madagascar%20subhumid%20forests">subhumid forests</a>, <a href="Cloud%20forest">montane forest</a>, and <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a>. Today, their collective range is restricted to 10% of the island, or approximately . Most of the remaining forests and lemurs are found along the periphery of the island. The center of the island, the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Madagascar%29">Hauts-Plateaux</a>, was converted by early settlers to <a href="Paddy%20field">rice paddies</a> and <a href="grassland">grassland</a> through <a href="Slash%20and%20burn">slash-and-burn agriculture</a>, known locally as "tavy". As <a href="erosion">erosion</a> depleted the soil, the cyclical forest regrowth and burning ended as the forest gradually failed to return. Today, the level of <a href="flora">flora</a>l diversity increases with precipitation, from the dry southern forests to the wetter northern forests to the <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>s along the east coast. Increased foliage corresponds to increased <a href="fauna">fauna</a>l diversity, including the diversity and complexity of lemur communities.
Having evolved in Madagascar's challenging environment, replete with poor soils, extreme shifts in poor, seasonal plant productivity, and devastating climatic events such as extended droughts and annual cyclones, lemurs have adopted unique combinations of unusual traits to survive, distinguishing them significantly from other primates. In response to limited, seasonal resources, lemurs may exhibit seasonal fat storage, <a href="Dormancy">hypometabolism</a> (including <a href="torpor">torpor</a> and <a href="hibernation">hibernation</a> in some <a href="Cheirogaleidae">cheirogaleids</a>), small group sizes, low <a href="encephalization">encephalization</a> (relative brain size), <a href="cathemeral">cathemeral</a>ity (activity both day and night), and/or strict <a href="Seasonal%20breeder">breeding seasons</a>. Secondarily, extreme resource limitations and seasonal breeding are thought to have resulted in three other relatively common lemur traits: <a href="Dominance%20hierarchy">female dominance</a>, sexual monomorphism (lack of size differences between the sexes), and male–male competition for mates involving low levels of <a href="Aggression%23Aggression%20within%20a%20species">agonism</a> (conflict), such as <a href="sperm%20competition">sperm competition</a>.

The arrival of humans on the island 1,500 to 2,000 years ago has taken a significant toll, not only on the size of lemur populations, but also on their diversity. Due to <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a> and hunting, at least 17 species and 8 genera have gone extinct and the populations of all species have decreased. A couple of species once thought to have gone extinct have since been rediscovered. The <a href="hairy-eared%20dwarf%20lemur">hairy-eared dwarf lemur</a> ("Allocebus trichotis") was only known from five museum specimens, most collected in the late 19th century and one in 1965. It was rediscovered in 1989 and has since been identified in five national parks, although it is very rare within its range. Likewise, the <a href="greater%20bamboo%20lemur">greater bamboo lemur</a> ("Prolemur simus") was thought to be extinct as recently as the late 1970s, but a population was located near <a href="Ranomafana%20National%20Park">Ranomafana National Park</a> in the late 1980s. Historically, it had a much wider geographic distribution, shown by <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> remains, but today it remains one of the world's 25 most endangered primates. One distinctive <a href="Polymorphism%20%28biology%29">morph</a> (possibly a species or subspecies) of <a href="sifaka">sifaka</a>, has not been so fortunate, having been <a href="Local%20extinction">extirpated</a> from all known localities. Unless trends change, extinctions are likely to continue.

Until recently, giant species of lemur existed on Madagascar. Now represented only by recent or <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> remains, they were modern forms and are counted as part of the rich lemur diversity that evolved in isolation. Some of their adaptations were unlike those seen in lemurs today. All 17 extinct lemurs were larger than the extant forms, some weighing as much as , and are thought to have been active during the day. Not only were they unlike the living lemurs in both size and appearance, they also filled <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>s that no longer exist or are now left unoccupied. Large parts of Madagascar, which are now devoid of forests and lemurs, once hosted diverse primate communities that included more than 20 species covering the full range of lemur sizes.

Voalavo

Voalavo is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="rodent">rodent</a> in the subfamily <a href="Nesomyinae">Nesomyinae</a>, found only in <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. Two species are known, both of which occur in mountain forest above 1250 m (4100 ft) altitude; the <a href="northern%20voalavo">northern voalavo</a> lives in northern Madagascar and <a href="eastern%20voalavo">eastern voalavo</a> is restricted to a small area in the central part of the island. The genus was discovered in 1994 and formally described in 1998. Within Nesomyinae, it is most closely related to the genus "<a href="Eliurus">Eliurus</a>", and <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data suggest that the current definitions of these two genera need to be changed.

Species of "Voalavo" are small, gray, mouse-like rodents, among the smallest nesomyines. They lack the distinctive tuft of long hairs on the tail that is characteristic of "Eliurus". The tail is long and females have six <a href="mammae">mammae</a>. In "Voalavo", there are two glands on the chest (absent in "Eliurus") that produce a sweet-smelling <a href="musk">musk</a> in breeding males. In the skull, the facial skeleton is long and the <a href="braincase">braincase</a> is smooth. The <a href="incisive%20foramen">incisive foramina</a> (openings in the front part of the palate) are long and the bony palate itself is smooth. The <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a> are somewhat <a href="hypsodont">hypsodont</a> (high-crowned), though less so than in "Eliurus", and the third molars are reduced in size and complexity.

A specimen of the genus was first collected in 1994 in <a href="Anjanaharibe-Sud">Anjanaharibe-Sud</a>, northern Madagascar. The genus was named "Voalavo" in 1998 by <a href="Michael%20Carleton">Michael Carleton</a> and <a href="Steven%20Goodman">Steven Goodman</a>, with a single species, the <a href="type%20species">type</a> northern voalavo, restricted to the <a href="Northern%20Highlands">Northern Highlands</a> of Madagascar. The generic name "Voalavo" is a Malagasy word for "rodent". A second species, eastern voalavo, was named by Goodman and colleagues in 2005 from the region of <a href="Anjozorobe">Anjozorobe</a> in the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Madagascar%29">Central Highlands</a>. The two "Voalavo" species are closely related and quite similar, but differ in various subtle <a href="morphology%20%28anatomy%29">morphological</a> characters (mainly measurements) and by 10% in the <a href="DNA%20sequence">sequence</a> of the <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial</a> gene <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome "b"</a>.

"Voalavo" is part of the subfamily <a href="Nesomyinae">Nesomyinae</a>, which includes nine genera that are all restricted to Madagascar. Before the discoveries of "<a href="Monticolomys">Monticolomys</a>" (published in 1996) and "Voalavo" (1998), all of the known genera within Nesomyinae were quite distinct from each other, so much so that <a href="phylogeny">phylogenetic</a> relationships among them long remained obscure. Like "Monticolomys" (closely related to "<a href="Macrotarsomys">Macrotarsomys</a>"), however, "Voalavo" shows clear similarities to another nesomyine genus, "<a href="Eliurus">Eliurus</a>". In their description of "Voalavo", Carleton and Goodman argued that, although closely related, "Eliurus" and "Voalavo" form separate <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a> groups; but a 1999 <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetic</a> study by Sharon Jansa and colleagues, who compared cytochrome "b" sequences among nesomyines and other rodents, found that northern voalavo was more closely related to <a href="Grandidier%27s%20tufted-tailed%20rat">Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat</a> than to other species of "Eliurus". This finding called into question the separate generic status of "Voalavo". However, tissue samples of <a href="Petter%27s%20tufted-tailed%20rat">Petter's tufted-tailed rat</a>, a species that is thought to be closely related to Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat, were not available, so this species could not be included in the study. Data from <a href="Nuclear%20DNA">nuclear</a> genes also supports the relationship between northern voalavo and Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat, but Petter's tufted-tailed rat remains genetically unstudied and the <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> issue has not been resolved.

Molecular phylogenetic analysis of nuclear DNA supports a close relationship between "Eliurus", "Voalavo", and two other nesomyine genera, "<a href="Gymnuromys">Gymnuromys</a>" and "<a href="Brachytarsomys">Brachytarsomys</a>". These genera are more distantly related to the other nesomyine genera and even more distantly to the other subfamilies of the family <a href="Nesomyidae">Nesomyidae</a>, which occur in mainland Africa.

"Voalavo" is a small rodent resembling a mouse with gray fur. Species of the genus are among the smallest known nesomyines, close in size only to "Monticolomys koopmani". In terms of external morphology, "Voalavo" is barely different from "Eliurus"; fur coloration patterns, general morphology of the feet, and number of <a href="mammary%20gland">mammae</a> (six) are all the same in both genera. However, all species of "Eliurus" have a pronounced tuft of elongated hairs at the tip of the tail, a feature that is absent in "Voalavo", although the latter does have slightly longer hairs near the tip. The tail is longer than the head and body. Relative tail length in northern voalavo (136% of head and body length) is comparable to that of the longest-tailed species of "Eliurus", Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat and Petter's tufted-tailed rat, but "V. antsahabensis" has a somewhat shorter tail. Furthermore, the <a href="Paw%23Common%20characteristics">pads</a> of the feet are larger in "Eliurus", and specifically, the <a href="thenar%20pad">thenar pad</a> (located at the middle of the <a href="tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a>) is circular and fairly small in "Voalavo", but longer and larger in "Eliurus". On the chest, "Voalavo" species have a gland that produces a sweet-swelling musk in breeding males; this gland is absent in "Eliurus". Unlike all other nesomyines but "<a href="Brachyuromys">Brachyuromys</a>", "Voalavo" lacks an <a href="entepicondylar%20foramen">entepicondylar foramen</a>, an opening on the <a href="humerus">humerus</a> (upper forelimb bone).

The skull of "Voalavo" also resembles that of "Eliurus", with a long facial skeleton, an hourglass-shaped <a href="interorbital%20region">interorbital region</a> (between the eyes), and a smooth interorbital region and <a href="neurocranium">braincase</a>, without ridges or shelves. Other shared characteristics include an essentially featureless bony palate, without many pits and ridges, and a broad <a href="mesopterygoid%20fossa">mesopterygoid fossa</a> (the opening behind the palate). In other characteristics, "Voalavo" resembles some but not all species of "Eliurus". For example, the length of the <a href="incisive%20foramen">incisive foramina</a> matches the maximum seen in "Eliurus" species (in this case, in <a href="Major%27s%20tufted-tailed%20rat">Major's tufted-tailed rat</a> and <a href="White-tipped%20tufted-tailed%20rat">White-tipped tufted-tailed rat</a>). The back margin of the incisive foramen is rounded in eastern voalavo, but angular in northern voalavo. The two species also differ in the shape of the <a href="suture%20%28anatomy%29">suture</a> (dividing line) between the <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a>ry and <a href="palatine%20bone">palatine bone</a>s, which is straight in eastern voalavo, but more curved in northern voalavo. The <a href="capsular%20process">capsular process</a>, a projection at the back of the <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (lower jaw) that houses the root of the lower <a href="incisor">incisor</a>, is indistinct in "Voalavo", a feature it shares with Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat, Major's tufted-tailed rat, and Petter's tufted-tailed rat, but not the other species of "Eliurus".

Other features of the skull distinguish the two genera. The <a href="Tegmental%20wall%20of%20tympanic%20cavity">tegmen tympani</a>, the roof of the <a href="tympanic%20cavity">tympanic cavity</a>, is much reduced in "Voalavo" relative to "Eliurus". The <a href="subsquamosal%20fenestra">subsquamosal fenestra</a>e, openings in the <a href="squamosal%20bone">squamosal bone</a> at the back of the skull, are larger in "Voalavo" than in "Eliurus". The <a href="zygomatic%20plate">zygomatic plate</a>, a plate at the sides of the skull that roots the front part of the <a href="zygomatic%20arch">zygomatic arch</a>es (cheekbones), is narrower in "Voalavo", and lacks a clear <a href="zygomatic%20notch">zygomatic notch</a> (a notch formed by a projection at the front of the zygomatic plate), which is present in "Eliurus". Among nesomyines, only "Brachytarsomys" has a more reduced zygomatic notch.

Like "Eliurus", "Voalavo" has moderately high-crowned (<a href="hypsodont">hypsodont</a>) <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a> with crowns that consist not of discrete <a href="cusp%20%28dentistry%29">cusps</a>, but of transverse laminae (plates) that generally lack longitudinal connections. However, "Eliurus" molars are slightly more hypsodont than those of "Voalavo". The third upper and lower molars are smaller relative to the second molars in "Voalavo" than in "Eliurus". Perhaps as a consequence, the upper third molar lacks discrete laminae in "Voalavo", and the lower third molar has only two laminae (three in "Eliurus"). There are three roots under each upper molar and two under each lower.

Both species of "Voalavo" occur in <a href="montane%20forest">montane forest</a>. Northern voalavo is restricted to the <a href="Northern%20Highlands">Northern Highlands</a>, where it is found at altitude in <a href="Marojejy">Marojejy</a> and <a href="Anjanaharibe-Sud">Anjanaharibe-Sud</a>. The known range of eastern voalavo is restricted to the vicinity of <a href="Anjozorobe">Anjozorobe</a> at altitude. Although most of the between the ranges of the two species consists of montane forest—suitable habitat for "Voalavo"—the area is bisected by the low-lying <a href="Mandritsara%20Window">Mandritsara Window</a>, which may serve as a barrier between the two species. <a href="Subfossil">Subfossil</a> remains of "Voalavo" have been found in the former <a href="Mahajanga%20Province">Mahajanga Province</a> (northwestern Madagascar).

Very little is known of the ecology of eastern voalavo, but northern voalavo is thought to be largely terrestrial with some <a href="scansorial">scansorial</a> (tree-climbing) abilities. It is active during the night, bears up to three young per litter, and probably eats fruits and seeds. Various <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s have been recorded on northern voalavo, including <a href="mite">mite</a>s and "<a href="Eimeria">Eimeria</a>".

Because eastern voalavo has a small range that is threatened by the practice of <a href="slash-and-burn%20agriculture">slash-and-burn agriculture</a> (known in Madagascar as "tavy"), it is listed on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> as "<a href="Endangered">Endangered</a>". Although "V. gymnocaudus" also has a small range, it is mostly within <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a>s, and this species is therefore listed as "<a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>".

Northern voalavo

The northern voalavo, or naked-tailed voalavo, or just voalavo, ("Voalavo gymnocaudus"), is a <a href="rodent">rodent</a> in the family <a href="Nesomyidae">Nesomyidae</a> found in the highlands of northern <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. Discovered in 1994 and formally described in 1998, it is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of genus "<a href="Voalavo">Voalavo</a>"; its closest relative is the eastern voalavo of the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Madagascar%29">Central Highlands</a>. <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data suggests it may be more closely related to <a href="Grandidier%27s%20tufted-tailed%20rat">Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat</a> than to other species of the closely related genus "<a href="Eliurus">Eliurus</a>". The northern voalavo is found at above sea level in <a href="Montane%20ecosystems">montane</a> wet and dry forest in the <a href="Marojejy">Marojejy</a> and <a href="Anjanaharibe-Sud">Anjanaharibe-Sud</a> massifs. Nocturnal and solitary, it lives mainly on the ground, but it can climb and probably eats plant matter. Despite a small range, it is classified as "<a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>" because it lacks obvious threats and much of its range is within <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a>s.

It is a small, mouse-like rodent with soft, gray fur which is only slightly darker above than below. The ears are short and rounded. The long tail appears mostly naked and lacks a distinct tuft, which is present in "Eliurus". It differs from the eastern voalavo mainly in the values of some measurements. The skull is delicate, with a long, narrow rostrum (front part), narrow <a href="interorbital%20region">interorbital region</a> (between the eyes), and no development of ridges on the <a href="braincase">braincase</a>. The <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a> are relatively high-crowned (<a href="hypsodont">hypsodont</a>). Body mass is .

The rodent fauna of the <a href="Northern%20Highlands">Northern Highlands</a> of Madagascar remained almost totally unstudied until the 1990s. A 1994 survey of the <a href="Anjanaharibe-Sud%20Reserve">Anjanaharibe-Sud Reserve</a> partially filled this gap and led to the discovery of two new species: Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat and northern voalavo, the first known and <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus "<a href="Voalavo">Voalavo</a>". Both species were formally described in 1998 by <a href="Michael%20Carleton">Michael Carleton</a> and <a href="Steven%20Goodman">Steven Goodman</a>. The <a href="name%20of%20a%20biological%20genus">generic name</a>, "Voalavo", is a general Malagasy word for rodent, and the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a>, "gymnocaudus", refers to the naked tail, which distinguishes the northern voalavo from the related tufted-tailed rats ("Eliurus"). In 2000, the species was also recorded from the nearby <a href="Marojejy%20National%20Park">Marojejy National Park</a>.

Meanwhile, in 1999, <a href="Sharon%20Jansa">Sharon Jansa</a> and colleagues published a <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetic</a> study of the <a href="Nesomyinae">Nesomyinae</a>, the native Malagasy rodents, using the <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial</a> gene <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome "b"</a>. Their results suggested that the current definitions of "Eliurus" and "Voalavo" may not be correct, because they found that northern voalavo and Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat are more closely related to each other than to the remaining species of "Eliurus". However, the DNA of <a href="Petter%27s%20tufted-tailed%20rat">Petter's tufted-tailed rat</a>, a possible close relative of northern voalavo, could not be sampled, so Jansa and colleagues recommended further evaluation of the problem. According to a 2003 report, data from <a href="Nuclear%20DNA">nuclear</a> genes also support the relationship between northern voalavo and Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat, but Petter's tufted-tailed rat remains genetically unstudied and the taxonomic issue has not been resolved.

A second species of "Voalavo", <a href="eastern%20voalavo">eastern voalavo</a>, was named in 2005 from central Madagascar. <a href="Morphology%20%28anatomy%29">Morphological</a> differences between the two are subtle but consistent, and the cytochrome "b" sequences of the two species differ by about 10%. In mammals, closely related species regularly differ by less than 5% in their cytochrome "b" sequences, and a divergence of more than 5% within a single species suggests the presence of <a href="cryptic%20species">cryptic species</a>.

It is a small, mouse-like rodent. It differs from the very similar eastern voalavo mainly in some measurements, such as a greater tail length. It also resembles small species of "Eliurus", but the fur is darker and there is no tail tuft. The fur is soft, short, and thick, and appears dark gray on most of the upperparts, but more brownish on the sides. On the back, the <a href="cover%20hair">cover hair</a>s, which form the main part of the fur, are three-colored: most of the hair is gray, followed by a narrow light buff band and a black tip. The longer <a href="guard%20hair">guard hair</a>s are black. The fur of the underparts is not different in overall color, but the individual hairs are gray for about three quarters of their length and white at the tips, except for those at the chin, which are white throughout.

The <a href="mystacial%20vibrissae">mystacial vibrissae</a> (whiskers on the upper lips) reach the tips of the ears when pressed against the head. The short, rounded ears themselves are naked on the inside, but covered with short brown hairs on the outer surface. Females have three pairs of <a href="mammae">mammae</a>. The digits and <a href="metapodial">metapodial</a>s are mostly covered by white hairs. Short <a href="ungual%20tuft">ungual tuft</a>s of hairs surrounding the bases of the claws are present. There are five <a href="Paw%23Common%20characteristics">pads</a> on the forefeet and six on the hindfeet. On the hindfeet, the fifth digit is nearly as long as the middle three and the first (the <a href="hallux">hallux</a>) is much shorter. The tail is longer than the head and body and appears naked for most of its length, but fine hairs are visible near the tip. Although the lower side is slightly lighter, there is no clear difference in coloration between the upper and lower sides. The skin of the tail is gray, and it is covered lightly by fine hairs that are dark brown over most of the length of the tail, but white near the tip.

The skull is delicate and lightly built. The rostrum, the front part of the skull, is narrow and fairly long; it is shorter in eastern voalavo. The narrow <a href="zygomatic%20plate">zygomatic plate</a> (a plate on the side of the skull) extends back to about the front of the first upper <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a> (M1). The zygomatic notch, a notch in the upper part of the zygomatic plate, is small. The <a href="zygomatic%20arch">zygomatic arch</a>es (cheekbones) are narrow, but as usual in nesomyines contain a relatively long <a href="jugal%20bone">jugal bone</a>. The <a href="interorbital%20region">interorbital region</a> (between the eyes) is narrow and short and lacks accessory shelves and ridges. The <a href="braincase">braincase</a> also lacks such ridges.

The <a href="incisive%20foramen">incisive foramina</a> (openings in the front part of the <a href="palate">palate</a>) are medium in length, and do not reach the first molars. Their back margin is angular, not rounded as in eastern voalavo. The <a href="diastema%20%28dentistry%29">diastema</a> (the gap between the upper <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s and molars) is shorter than in eastern voalavo. The bony palate is broad and lacks notable ridges and other features, except for a pair of foramina (openings) near the place where the first and second molars (M1 and M2) meet. The back border of the palate is at the level of the middle of the third molars (M3). In the bony roof of the <a href="mesopterygoid%20fossa">mesopterygoid fossa</a>, the opening behind the palate, wide <a href="sphenopalatine%20vacuities">sphenopalatine vacuities</a> (openings) are present. A thin <a href="alisphenoid%20strut">alisphenoid strut</a> (a piece of bone on the lower side of the skull separating two foramina) is present in specimens from Marojejy, but not in those from Anjanaharibe-Sud. The <a href="tegmen%20tympani">tegmen tympani</a>, the roof of the <a href="tympanic%20cavity">tympanic cavity</a>, is reduced.

The root of the lower incisor is visible at the back of the <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (lower jaw) as a slight protrusion; a true <a href="capsular%20process">capsular process</a> is absent. There are 13 <a href="thoracic%20vertebra">thoracic</a> (chest), 7 <a href="lumbar%20vertebra">lumbar</a>, 4 <a href="sacral%20vertebra">sacral</a>, and 38 or 39 <a href="caudal%20vertebra">caudal</a> (tail) vertebrae. The <a href="humerus">humerus</a> (upper arm bone) lacks an <a href="entepicondylar%20foramen">entepicondylar foramen</a>.

The upper incisors are <a href="orthodont">orthodont</a> (with their cutting edge perpendicular to the plane formed by the molars) and have yellow to light orange <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a>. On the lower incisor, the enamel contains series of fine ridges. The toothrows are longer than in eastern voalavo. As in "Eliurus", the molars are incipiently <a href="hypsodont">hypsodont</a> (high-crowned) and the individual cusps have lost their identities, having merged into transverse laminae that are not connected longitudinally. There are three laminae on each first and second molar, two on the third lower molar, and the laminae cannot be differentiated on the third upper molar. Although the first and second molars are similar to each other in size, the third (upper and lower) molars are conspicuously smaller. There are three roots below each upper and two below each lower molar.

The northern voalavo has been found only in two massifs of the <a href="Northern%20Highlands">Northern Highlands</a>, <a href="Anjanaharibe-Sud">Anjanaharibe-Sud</a> and <a href="Marojejy">Marojejy</a>, but may range more widely. At Anjanaharibe-Sud, the species has been found in wet mountain forest at , where it occurred with the indigenous rodents <a href="Major%27s%20tufted-tailed%20rat">Major's tufted-tailed rat</a> and <a href="island%20mouse">island mouse</a> as well as the <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a> ("Rattus rattus"), and in drier forest at about , where it may live alongside other species of "Eliurus" and <a href="Voalavoanala">Voalavoanala</a>. The Marojejy records come from similar habitats at above sea level.
The northern voalavo probably largely lives on the ground, but is able to climb in vegetation. It likes areas with dense networks of roots, among which it moves using runways and natural tunnels. The species is nocturnal (active during the night), is solitary, probably eats fruits and seeds, and bears up to three young per litter.
A variety of parasitic <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s have been recorded on northern voalavo: <a href="mite">mite</a>s from the families <a href="Laelapidae">Laelapidae</a> and <a href="Trombiculidae">Trombiculidae</a> (both Marojejy and Anjanaharibe-Sud), the <a href="Demodicidae">demodicid</a> mite "<a href="Demodex">Demodex</a>" (Marojejy only), the <a href="Atopomelidae">atopomelid</a> mite "<a href="Listrophoroides">Listrophoroides</a>" (both Marojejy and Anjanaharibe-Sud), and unidentified <a href="sucking%20louse">sucking lice</a> (Anjanaharibe-Sud only). In 2007, a laelapid mite found on "V. gymnocaudus" in Anjanaharibe-Sud was described as a new species, "<a href="Andreacarus%20voalavo">Andreacarus voalavo</a>". The <a href="apicomplexa">apicomplexa</a>n parasite "<a href="Eimeria">Eimeria</a>" has also been recorded in Anjanaharibe-Sud.

Although it has a small range and is uncommon even within that range, no major threats are known and virtually all of its distribution is within <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a>s. The species is therefore classified as "<a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>" on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>.

He earned a <a href="King%27s%20Commendation%20for%20Brave%20Conduct">King's Commendation</a> for his rescue efforts during an <a href="Attack%20on%20Broome">air raid on Broome</a>, Western Australia, in 1942, and was promoted to <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> in 1944.

Seeing little prospect for advancement at Qantas once the war had ended, Brain left to join the fledgling government-owned domestic carrier <a href="Trans%20Australia%20Airlines">Trans Australia Airlines</a> (TAA) in June 1946. Appointed its first General Manager, he swiftly built up the organisation to the stage where it could commence scheduled operations later in the year. By the time he resigned in March 1955, TAA was firmly established as one half of the Commonwealth government's <a href="Two%20Airlines%20Policy">two-airline system</a>. After his departure from TAA, Brain became Managing Director of <a href="de%20Havilland%20Australia">de Havilland Aircraft</a> in Sydney, before joining the board of <a href="East-West%20Airlines%20%28Australia%29">East-West Airlines</a> as a consultant in January 1961. Appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia">Officer of the Order of Australia</a> in January 1979, Lester Brain died in June the following year, at the age of seventy-seven.

Born in <a href="Forbes%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Forbes</a>, New South Wales, on 27 February 1903, Lester Brain was the second son of an English mining engineer and manager, Austin Brain, and his Australian wife, Katie. Originally from <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, Austin had emigrated with his parents and siblings in 1885, prospecting for gold in the United States before settling in Australia. By the age of thirteen, Lester owned his own motorcycle bought secondhand for £11; its poor condition and constant need for repair helped him become mechanically adept at an early age. He completed his education at <a href="Sydney%20Grammar%20School">Sydney Grammar School</a>, where he excelled in maths, before being employed by the <a href="Commercial%20Banking%20Company%20of%20Sydney">Commercial Banking Company of Sydney</a> (CBC) in 1919.

Brain's penchant for motorbikes and things mechanical inspired a lift driver at CBC to suggest he apply for pilot training in the recently formed Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He was among five civilian students nominated by the <a href="Airservices%20Australia">Civil Aviation Branch</a> (CAB) of the Defence Department for entry into the inaugural RAAF flying training course, which commenced at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">Point Cook</a>, Victoria in January 1923. The benefit of these nominations from a military perspective was that although the destiny of the CAB-sponsored students was to be civil aviators, they would also be members of the RAAF reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF), and could therefore be called up for active service as and when necessary. Brain's fellow attendees included <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> lieutenants <a href="Joe%20Hewitt%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Joe Hewitt</a> and <a href="Ellis%20Wackett">Ellis Wackett</a>, and <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> lieutenant <a href="Frank%20Bladin">Frank Bladin</a>, all of whom were seconded—and later permanently transferred—to the RAAF.

Brain graduated at the top of his class after the year-long training course at Point Cook, and was duly commissioned in the CAF. Moving to Queensland in April 1924, he took up employment as a pilot with <a href="Qantas">Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services</a> (Qantas), its first aviator without a war record. On 7 February 1925, he flew the first scheduled passenger service from <a href="Cloncurry%2C%20Queensland">Cloncurry</a> to <a href="Camooweal%2C%20Queensland">Camooweal</a>, extending the airline's founding route—from <a href="Charleville%2C%20Queensland">Charleville</a> to Cloncurry—by . The following year, he completed a refresher course at <a href="Central%20Flying%20School%20RAAF">Central Flying School</a>, Point Cook. On a rain-soaked <a href="Shire%20of%20McKinlay">McKinlay</a> airfield near Cloncurry on 27 February 1927, he flipped Qantas' first <a href="de%20Havilland%20DH.50">de Havilland DH.50</a> on to its back while attempting take-off, though he managed to escape without injury. Qantas founder <a href="Hudson%20Fysh">Hudson Fysh</a> berated him for a "serious error of judgement", but noted his excellent three-year record as a pilot; the aircraft was soon repaired and operational again. The next month, Brain became Chief Instructor at the Qantas Flying School in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, doubling as manager of the airline's local office. By mid-1928, he had overworked himself to the extent that he was ordered to take respite by Fysh; this "respite" nevertheless involved a 13-week trip to England to study aviation developments.
In April 1929, Brain was selected to take part in a search for lost aviators in northern Australia, having gained experience of the area while flying over the <a href="Tanami%20Desert">Tanami Desert</a> to assist a gold prospecting expedition some years earlier. On 20 April, he took Qantas DH.50 "Atalanta" from Brisbane to link up with RAAF <a href="Airco%20DH.9">Airco DH.9</a>s under the command of Flight Lieutenant <a href="Charles%20Eaton%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Charles Eaton</a> at <a href="Tennant%20Creek%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Tennant Creek</a>, to look for Keith Anderson and Robert Hitchcock in their <a href="Westland%20Widgeon%20%28fixed%20wing%29">Westland Widgeon</a> the "Kookaburra". The pair had disappeared while searching for <a href="Charles%20Kingsford%20Smith">Charles Kingsford Smith</a> and <a href="Charles%20Ulm">Charles Ulm</a>, who had been <a href="Charles%20Kingsford%20Smith%23.27Coffee%20Royal.27%20incident">reported missing</a> on a record attempt from Sydney to England in the "<a href="Southern%20Cross%20%28aircraft%29">Southern Cross</a>". Brain located the "Kookaburra" the next day in the Tanami Desert, approximately east-south-east of <a href="Kalkaringi%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Wave Hill</a>. He saw one body underneath the wing, but the terrain was too dangerous to attempt a landing. After Brain reported the "Kookaburra"'s position to Eaton, the latter led an overland expedition to the site and buried the bodies of Anderson and Hitchcock, who had evidently survived crash-landing their plane before succumbing to heat and thirst. His discovery of the "Kookaburra" and, shortly thereafter, of two lost British aviators in <a href="Arnhem%20Land">Arnhem Land</a>, earned Brain the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Air Force Cross</a>; the award was <a href="London%20Gazette">gazetted</a> on 31 May:

The "Gazette" later corrected "Leslie" to "Lester". With the "Kookaburra" saga making news across the country, Brain had become a national hero, and Fysh declared that the publicity for both pilot and airline "could probably not have been bought for any money".

By 1930, Brain had been appointed Qantas' Chief Pilot. In June that year, he was given responsibility for sales and special flights such as demonstrations and agency tours at the airline's new Brisbane headquarters, and also acted as a reserve pilot. He married Constance (Consie) Brownhill at Holy Innocents Catholic Church in <a href="Croydon%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Croydon</a>, New South Wales, on 8 July; the couple had two sons and two daughters. Brain played a leading role in Qantas' operations as it expanded its mail and passenger routes throughout Australia and, as Qantas Empire Airways (QEA) from January 1934, other parts of the world. In October that year, he went to Britain to take delivery of QEA's first <a href="de%20Havilland%20Express">de Havilland DH.86</a>, the fastest four-engined airliner in the world at the time. He was now Flight Superintendent and, having accumulated 6,694 hours in the air, began to evince a keener interest in the "administration and executive side of aviation". Promoted to <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> in the CAF on 1 March 1935, over the next year he discussed with the Controller-General of Civil Aviation, <a href="Edgar%20Johnston">Edgar Johnston</a>, taking a cut in salary to work in Johnston's department, or possibly becoming Deputy Controller-General. No more came of this at the time, and by 1938 Brain had been appointed Flying Operations Manager at QEA. In 1939, he was considered for the position of Director-General of Civil Aviation (which had recently succeeded the post of Controller-General) but the role went to <a href="Arthur%20Brownlow%20Corbett">A. B. Corbett</a>.

Following the outbreak of <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Brain was given the task of coordinating Qantas' support for the Australian military, which became known as the Qantas Merchant Air Service. On 23 February 1940, Fysh noted that since its formation in 1934, QEA had logged six million miles in flying boats and landplanes without suffering any injuries to passengers or crew. He called it "a record which has never been equalled in any part of the world ... It reflects the highest credit on Captain Brain, who has been in charge of flying operations during this time." In 1941, Brain took charge of ferrying eighteen <a href="PBY%20Catalina">PBY Catalina</a>s from the United States to Australia on behalf of the RAAF, which had purchased the aircraft. US neutrality made it prudent for a civilian organisation—that was also experienced in long-range flying boat operations—to undertake the task. Brain and his crew departed <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, California, on 25 January to make the first flight, having surveyed their intended route on the journey out from Australia. Travelling via <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>, <a href="Kanton%20Island">Canton Island</a> and <a href="Noum%C3%A9a">Nouméa</a>, they arrived at their destination after one week, including sixty hours flying time; it was only the third such direct flight to Australia across the Pacific Ocean.

By February 1942, Brain was running the Qantas base at <a href="Broome%2C%20Western%20Australia">Broome</a> in north Western Australia, which had assumed major importance as a way station for evacuees from the <a href="Netherlands%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, possessing a harbour suitable for flying boats, as well as an airfield that could take heavy bombers. The increasing <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20Air%20Force">Royal Netherlands Air Force</a>, RAAF and Qantas traffic through the base led Brain to anticipate an attack by <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> forces, and this occurred on 3 March, when nine <a href="A6M%20Zero">A6M Zero</a> fighters strafed the harbour with cannon. Twenty-four aircraft were destroyed, and an estimated seventy people were killed. Brain, though suffering from fever, rowed into the harbour with another airline representative and rescued ten people from the water. After the all-clear sounded, he ordered an undamaged Qantas flying boat to <a href="Port%20Hedland%2C%20Western%20Australia">Port Hedland</a>, in case of further attacks; he also took part in the search for survivors of a <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">Consolidated B-24 Liberator</a> that had been shot down by the raiders. His rescue efforts were recognised with a <a href="King%27s%20Commendation%20for%20Brave%20Conduct">King's Commendation</a> for "brave conduct at Civil Aerodromes", promulgated in the "Commonwealth of Australia Gazette" on 17 June 1943. The following year, he was promoted to temporary <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> in the CAF.

After the war, Brain was appointed Qantas' Assistant General Manager. Fysh was still in his early fifties and appeared unlikely to retire any time soon. Seeing little chance of further advancement where he was, Brain took the opportunity to apply for the position of Operations Manager at <a href="Trans%20Australia%20Airlines">Trans Australia Airlines</a> (TAA), a new domestic carrier established by the Federal <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labor</a> government and run by the Australian National Airlines Commission (ACAC), which was chaired by <a href="Arthur%20Coles">Arthur Coles</a>. Qantas could not match the £2,250 salary associated with the TAA role, and Brain advised Fysh of his resignation on 10 April 1946. In the event, ACAC appointed him TAA's General Manager on 3 June, with a £3,000 salary and an undertaking to increase this to as much as £5,000 in the future.

Brain moved quickly to secure executive, flying, training and maintenance staff from Qantas, <a href="Ansett%20Australia">Ansett</a> and the RAAF, as well as surplus <a href="Douglas%20DC-3">Douglas DC-3</a> twin-engined transports from the RAAF and TAA's chief private competitor, <a href="Australian%20National%20Airways">Australian National Airways</a> (ANA). He planned to have the first scheduled flights operating by October, around the same time as delivery of four <a href="Douglas%20DC-4">DC-4 Skymaster</a> four-engined liners that would augment the DC-3 fleet, giving the airline a significant edge over ANA. In the event, TAA's first flight, from Melbourne to Sydney, took place on 9 September under pressure from the government, keen to ensure favourable publicity for its new enterprise before the Federal election at the end of the month. Brain nevertheless instructed his pilots that "schedules are important, but safety is "most" important"; it became one of TAA's early advertising slogans. In October, he wrote to the Department of Civil Aviation to express his disquiet at the rapidly increasing list of government members who were to be given preferential treatment when required at the expense of members of the public, in effect arguing with his owner—the government—on behalf of everyday travellers.

On 1 July 1947, Brain was discharged from the CAF with the rank of wing commander. By August 1949, TAA had carried its millionth passenger. Though praised for contributing to increased civil traffic in Australia, the airline was losing money, generating criticism in media and political circles that it was an inefficient organisation propped up by ordinary taxpayers. Brain maintained that its negative financial performance in its early years was a necessary by-product of rapid expansion to establish itself as a significant force in the market. In June 1950, he was able to report its first profit. This, plus popular opinion in TAA's favour, helped ensure the airline's survival as a public enterprise in the wake of the Labor government's loss to <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a>' conservative <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal Party</a> in the Federal election the previous year, though Coles was replaced as Chairman of ACAC by Norman Watt. By 1951, the new government had enacted as policy a <a href="Two%20Airlines%20Policy">two-airline system</a> that enshrined competition between the Commonwealth-sponsored domestic operator and one major privately owned carrier.

Brain tendered his resignation from TAA on 3 February 1955—effective 17 March—to become Managing Director of de Havilland Aircraft in Sydney (later <a href="de%20Havilland%20Australia">Hawker de Havilland</a>, part of <a href="Boeing%20Australia">Boeing Australia</a>). While his departure came as a surprise to ACAC, Brain had for some time felt shackled by having to run TAA on a commercial basis under the control of a government bureaucracy, and on a <a href="civil%20servant">public servant</a>'s remuneration. His anticipated salary increases had been less than he expected under the terms of his employment; Watt's attempts to make good on them had been resisted by Federal <a href="Cabinet%20%28government%29">Cabinet</a>. The government yet feared that, once he had resigned, Brain might attempt to sue for back pay, though he assured Watt that this was not his intention. Nevertheless, in November he received a Cabinet-approved "<a href="ex%20gratia">ex gratia</a>" payment totalling £6,250, in recognition of his "long and distinguished service to civil aviation in Australia".
During Brain's tenure at de Havilland, the company manufactured sixty-nine <a href="de%20Havilland%20Vampire">Vampire T35</a> jet trainers at its <a href="Bankstown%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bankstown</a> factory for delivery to the RAAF, as well as <a href="de%20Havilland%20Sea%20Venom">Sea Venom</a>s for the RAN. Leaving de Havilland upon its merger with <a href="Hawker%20Siddeley">Hawker Siddeley</a> in 1960, he gave up full-time work and joined the board of <a href="East-West%20Airlines%20%28Australia%29">East-West Airlines</a> as a consultant in January 1961. In August 1964, he began negotiations with the Federal government on behalf of International Parcels Express Company (now <a href="Toll%20IPEC">Toll IPEC</a>), which was attempting to enter the air freight business in Australia with the purchase of five DC-4 Skymasters; the government rejected the proposal later that year. Along with Arthur Coles, Brain was a guest at the opening of TAA's new headquarters at Franklin Street, Melbourne in November 1965. In 1978, he met with adventurer <a href="Dick%20Smith%20%28entrepreneur%29">Dick Smith</a>, who was about to launch an expedition to recover the "Kookaburra" from the Tanami Desert. Smith was keen to get directions from the man who had found the missing plane in 1929, in spite of receiving advice against taking the word of someone from the "cap and goggles" era. He rediscovered the "Kookaburra" in August that year "exactly where Lester Brain had said ... Lester was completely chuffed when I got back and told him I'd found the "Kookaburra" thanks to his directions and how thankful I was that, despite everyone else's suggestions, I'd taken Lester's advice."

Brain had declined the offer of a knighthood in the late 1960s, but accepted appointment as an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia">Officer of the Order of Australia</a> on 26 January 1979. When asked towards the end of his life why he had achieved so much but was not as well known as other aviation pioneers, he replied "Because I was always very careful and didn't kill myself". Having suffered from cancer for several years, Brain died in Sydney on 30 June 1980. He was survived by his wife and children, and cremated. In November 2008, Qantas announced that one of its new <a href="Airbus%20A380">Airbus A380</a>s would be named "Lester Brain".

Australian Air Corps

The Australian Air Corps (AAC) was a temporary formation of the Australian military that existed in the interval between the disbandment of the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> (AFC) of World War I and the establishment of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) in March 1921. Raised in January 1920, the AAC was commanded by Major <a href="William%20Anderson%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">William Anderson</a>, a former AFC pilot. Many of the AAC's members were also from the AFC and would go on to join the RAAF. Although part of the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a>, for most of its existence the AAC was overseen by a board of senior officers that included members of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a>.

Following the disbandment of the AFC, the AAC was a stop-gap measure intended to remain in place until the formation of a permanent and independent Australian air force. The corps' primary purpose was to maintain assets of the <a href="Central%20Flying%20School%20RAAF">Central Flying School</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Williams">Point Cook</a>, Victoria, but several pioneering activities also took place under its auspices: AAC personnel set an Australian altitude record that stood for a decade, made the first non-stop flight between <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> and <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, and undertook the country's initial steps in the field of <a href="aviation%20medicine">aviation medicine</a>. The AAC operated fighters, bombers and training aircraft, including some of the first examples of Britain's <a href="Imperial%20Gift">Imperial Gift</a> to arrive in Australia. As well as personnel, the RAAF inherited Point Cook and most of its initial equipment from the AAC.

In December 1919, the remnants of the wartime <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> (AFC) were disbanded, and replaced on 1 January 1920 by the Australian Air Corps (AAC), which was, like the AFC, part of the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a>. Australia's senior airman, Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a>, was overseas, and Major <a href="William%20Anderson%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">William Anderson</a> was appointed commander of the AAC, a position that also put him in charge of the <a href="Central%20Flying%20School%20RAAF">Central Flying School</a> (CFS) at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23Point%20Cook%20Base">Point Cook</a>, Victoria. As Anderson was on sick leave at the time of the appointment, Major Rolf Brown temporarily assumed command; Anderson took over on 19 February. CFS remained the AAC's sole <a href="Military%20unit">unit</a>, and Point Cook its only air base.

The AAC was an interim organisation intended to exist until the establishment of a permanent Australian air service. The decision to create such a service had been made in January 1919, amid competing proposals by the Army and the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> for separate forces under their respective jurisdictions. Budgetary constraints and arguments over administration and control led to ongoing delays in the formation of an independent air force.

By direction of the <a href="Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the General Staff</a>, Major General <a href="James%20Gordon%20Legge">Gordon Legge</a>, in November 1919, the AAC's prime purpose was to ensure that existing aviation assets were maintained; Legge later added that it should also perform suitable tasks such as surveying air routes. The <a href="Chief%20of%20Navy%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Naval Staff</a>, Rear Admiral <a href="Percy%20Grant%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Sir Percy Grant</a>, objected to the AAC being under Army control, and argued that an air board should be formed to oversee the AAC and the proposed Australian air force. A temporary air board first met on 29 January 1920, the Army being represented by Williams and Brigadier General <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Thomas Blamey</a>, and the Navy by Captain Wilfred Nunn and Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Stanley%20Goble">Stanley Goble</a>, a former member of Britain's <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Air%20Service">Royal Naval Air Service</a> (RNAS) then seconded to the <a href="Department%20of%20the%20Navy%20%28Australia%29">Navy Office</a>. Williams was given responsibility for administering the AAC on behalf of the board. A permanent <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Air Board</a> overseen by an Air Council was formed on 9 November 1920; these bodies were made responsible for administering the AAC from 22 November.

Most members of the AAC were former AFC personnel. In August 1919, several senior AFC pilots, including Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Oswald%20Watt">Oswald Watt</a>, Major Anderson, and Captain <a href="Roy%20Phillipps">Roy Phillipps</a>, were appointed to serve on a committee examining applications for the AAC. Some of the staffing decisions were controversial. At least three officers at the CFS, including the commanding officer, were not offered appointment to the new service. <a href="Elwyn%20Roy%20King">Roy King</a>, the AFC's second highest-scoring <a href="Flying%20ace">fighter ace</a> after <a href="Harry%20Cobby">Harry Cobby</a>, refused an appointment in the AAC because it had not at that time offered a commission to <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> recipient <a href="Frank%20McNamara%20%28VC%29">Frank McNamara</a>. In a letter dated 30 January 1920, King wrote, "I feel I must forfeit my place in favor "(<a href="sic">sic</a>)" of this very good and gallant officer"; McNamara received a commission in the AAC that April. Other former AFC members who took up appointments in the AAC included Captains <a href="Adrian%20Cole%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Adrian Cole</a>, <a href="Henry%20Wrigley">Henry Wrigley</a>, <a href="Frank%20Lukis">Frank Lukis</a>, and <a href="Lawrence%20Wackett">Lawrence Wackett</a>. Captain <a href="Hippolyte%20De%20La%20Rue">Hippolyte "Kanga" De La Rue</a>, an Australian who flew with the RNAS during the war, was granted a commission in the AAC because a specialist seaplane pilot was required for naval cooperation work.
The corps' initial establishment was nine officers—commanding officer, <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a>, workshop commander, test pilot, four other pilots, and medical officer—and seventy <a href="Other%20ranks%20%28UK%29">other ranks</a>. In March 1920, to cope with the imminent arrival of new aircraft and other equipment, approval was given to increase this complement by a further seven officers and thirty-six other ranks. The following month the establishment was increased by fifty-four to make a total of 160 other ranks. An advertising campaign was employed to garner applicants. According to "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>", applicants needed to be aged between eighteen and forty-five, and returned soldiers were preferred; all positions were "temporary" and salaries, including uniform allowance and rations, ranged from <a href="Australian%20pound">£</a>194 to £450. As the AAC was an interim formation, no unique uniform was designed for its members. Within three weeks of the AAC being raised, a directive came down from CFS that the organisation's former AFC staff should wear out their existing uniforms, and that any personnel requiring new uniforms should acquire "<a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">AIF</a> pattern, as worn by the AFC".

The AAC suffered two fatalities. On 23 September 1920, two <a href="Airco%20DH.9A">Airco DH.9A</a> bombers recently delivered from Britain undertook a search for the "Amelia J.", a <a href="schooner">schooner</a> that had disappeared on a voyage from <a href="Newcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Newcastle</a> to <a href="Hobart">Hobart</a>. Anderson and Sergeant Herbert Chester flew one of the DH.9As, and Captain Billy Stutt and Sergeant Abner Dalzell the other. Anderson's aircraft landed near Hobart in the evening, having failed to locate the lost schooner, but Stutt and Dalzell were missing; their DH.9A was last sighted flying through cloud over <a href="Bass%20Strait">Bass Strait</a>. A court of inquiry determined that the aircraft had crashed, and that the DH.9As may not have had adequate preparation time for their task, which it attributed to the low staffing levels at CFS. The court proposed compensation of £550 for Stutt's family and £248 for Dalzell's—the maximum amounts payable under government regulations—as the men had been on duty at the time of their deaths; <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Australia">Federal Cabinet</a> increased these payments three-fold. Wreckage that may have belonged to the "Amelia J." was found at <a href="Flinders%20Island">Flinders Island</a> the following year.

The AAC's initial complement of aircraft included twenty <a href="Avro%20504">Avro 504</a>K trainers and twelve <a href="Sopwith%20Pup">Sopwith Pup</a> fighters that had been delivered to CFS in 1919, as well as a <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20B.E.2">Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2</a> and <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20F.E.2">F.E.2</a>, and a <a href="Bristol%20Scout">Bristol Scout</a>. Seven of the 504Ks and one of the Pups were <a href="Hull%20loss">written off</a> during the AAC's existence, leaving thirteen and eleven on strength, respectively. The B.E.2 had been piloted by Wrigley and <a href="Arthur%20William%20Murphy">Arthur Murphy</a> in 1919 on the first flight from <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> to <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, and was allotted to the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> in August 1920; the F.E.2 was sold in November 1920, while the Scout remained on strength and was still being flown by the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) in 1923. In February 1920, the <a href="Vickers%20Vimy">Vickers Vimy</a> bomber recently piloted by <a href="Ross%20Macpherson%20Smith">Ross</a> and <a href="Keith%20Macpherson%20Smith">Keith Smith</a> on the <a href="1919%20England%20to%20Australia%20flight">first flight from England to Australia</a> was flown to Point Cook, where it joined the strength of the AAC.

In March 1920, Australia began receiving 128 aircraft with associated spares and other equipment as part of Britain's <a href="Imperial%20Gift">Imperial Gift</a> to <a href="Dominion">Dominion</a>s seeking to establish their own post-war air services. The aircraft included <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20S.E.5">Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5</a> fighters, <a href="Airco%20DH.9">Airco DH.9</a> and DH.9A bombers, and Avro 504s. Most remained crated for eventual use by the yet-to-be formed RAAF, but several of each type were assembled and employed by the AAC. One of the DH.9As was lost with the disappearance of Stutt and Dalzell in September 1920.

On 17 June 1920, Cole, accompanied by De La Rue, flew a DH.9A to an altitude of , setting an Australian record that stood for more than ten years. The effects of <a href="Hypoxia%20%28medical%29">hypoxia</a> exhibited by Cole and De La Rue intrigued the medical officer, Captain Arthur Lawrence, who subsequently made observations during his own high-altitude flight piloted by Anderson; this activity has been credited as marking the start of <a href="aviation%20medicine">aviation medicine</a> in Australia. Later that month, flying an Avro 504L <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>, De La Rue became the first person to land an aircraft on the <a href="Yarra%20River">Yarra River</a> in Victoria. On 22 July, Williams, accompanied by Warrant Officer Les Carter, used a DH.9A to make the first non-stop flight from <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> to Melbourne. A few days earlier, Williams and Wackett had flown two DH.9As to the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, to investigate the possibility of taking some of the school's graduates into the air corps, a plan that came to fruition after the formation of the RAAF.
Between July and November 1920, trials of the Avro 504L took place on the Navy's flagship, <a href="HMAS%20Australia%20%281911%29">HMAS "Australia"</a>, and later aboard the light cruiser <a href="HMAS%20Melbourne%20%281912%29">HMAS "Melbourne"</a>. The trials on "Melbourne", which operated in the waters off <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> and northern Australia, demonstrated that the Avro was not suited to tropical conditions as its engine lacked the necessary power and its skin deteriorated rapidly; Williams recommended that activity cease until Australia acquired a purpose-designed seaplane.

The AAC performed several tasks in connection with the <a href="Edward%20VIII">Prince of Wales</a>' tour of Australia in 1920. In May, the AAC was required to escort the Prince's ship, <a href="HMS%20Renown%20%281916%29">HMS "Renown"</a>, into <a href="Port%20Melbourne">Port Melbourne</a>, and then to fly over the royal procession along <a href="St%20Kilda%20Road">St Kilda Road</a>. The AAC had more aircraft than pilots available, so Williams gained permission from the <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Defence</a> to augment AAC aircrew with former AFC pilots seeking to volunteer their services for the events. In August, the AAC was called upon at the last minute to fly the Prince's mail from <a href="Port%20Augusta">Port Augusta</a>, South Australia, to Sydney before he boarded "Renown" for the voyage back to Britain.

During the Second Peace Loan to promote the sale of <a href="government%20bond">government bond</a>s that commenced in August 1920, the AAC undertook a cross-country program of tours and exhibition flying. Again Williams enlisted the services of former AFC personnel to make up for a shortfall in the number of AAC pilots and mechanics available to prepare and fly the nineteen aircraft allotted to the program. Activities included flyovers at sporting events, leaflet drops over Melbourne, and what may have been Australia's first <a href="Air%20racing">aerial derby</a>—at <a href="Serpentine%2C%20Victoria">Serpentine</a>, Victoria, on 27 August. Poor weather hindered some of the program, and four aircraft were lost in accidents, though no aircrew were killed. The Second Peace Loan gave AAC personnel experience in a variety of flying conditions, and the air service gained greater exposure to the Australian public.

On 15 March 1921, the "<a href="The%20Courier-Mail">Brisbane Courier</a>" reported that the AAC would disband on 30 March, and be succeeded by a new air force. The Australian Air Force was formed on 31 March, inheriting Point Cook and most of its initial personnel and equipment from the AAC. The "Royal" prefix was added to "Australian Air Force" that August. Several officers associated with the AAC, including Williams, Anderson, Wrigley and McNamara, went on to achieve high rank in the Air Force. According to the RAAF's "Pathfinder" bulletin, the AAC "kept valuable aviation skills alive" until a permanent air force could be established. The corps was, further, "technically separate from the Army and Navy; its director answered to the Minister for Defence, through the Air Council. In effect, the AAC was Australia's first independent air force, albeit an interim one."

South Carolina-class battleship

The South Carolina"-class battleships, also known as the Michigan" class, were built during the first decade of the twentieth century for the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. Named and , they were the first American <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s—powerful warships whose capabilities far outstripped those of the world's <a href="Pre-dreadnought%20battleship">older battleships</a>.

In the opening years of the twentieth century, the prevailing theory of naval combat was that battles would continue to be fought at relatively close range using many small, fast-firing guns. As such, each of the ships in the United States' previous battleship class (the ) had many medium-sized weapons alongside four large guns. This paradigm, however, was soon to be subverted, as American naval theorists proposed that a ship mounting a homogeneous battery of large guns would be more effective in battle.

As their ideas began to enjoy wider acceptance, the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">US Congress</a> authorized the country's Navy to construct two small battleships. This displacement was roughly the same size as the "Connecticut" class and at least smaller than the foreign standard. A solution was found in an ambitious design drawn up by Rear Admiral <a href="Washington%20L.%20Capps">Washington L. Capps</a>, the chief of the navy's <a href="Bureau%20of%20Construction%20and%20Repair">Bureau of Construction and Repair</a>; it traded heavy armament and relatively thick armor—both favored by naval theorists—for speed.

With their <a href="superfire">superfiring</a> main armament, press accounts billed "South Carolina" and "Michigan", alongside the <a href="Royal%20Navy">British</a> , as heralding a new epoch in warship design. Both, however, were soon surpassed by ever-larger and stronger <a href="super-dreadnought">super-dreadnought</a>s. The class's low top speed of about , as compared to the <a href="Standard-type%20battleship">standard</a> of later American battleships, relegated them to serving with older, obsolete battleships during the First World War. After the end of the conflict and the signing of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>, both "South Carolina"s were <a href="ship%20breaking">scrapped</a>.

In 1901, the US Navy's battleship designs reflected the prevailing theory of naval combat—that battles would initially be fought at some distance, but the ships would then approach to close range for the final blows, when shorter-range, faster-firing guns would prove most useful. The premier battleship class then under construction carried four large , eight , and twelve guns, a striking power slightly heavier than typical foreign battleships of the time.

The <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Institute">Naval Institute</a>'s "<a href="Proceedings%20%28magazine%29">Proceedings</a>" magazine devoted space in two of its 1902 issues to possible improvements in battleship design. The first article was authored by Lieutenant Matt H. Signor, who argued for a ship with and /40 caliber guns in four triple turrets. The secondary battery would be composed of /60 guns. This paper provoked enough thought that "Proceedings" published comments on the story from Captain <a href="William%20M.%20Folger">William M. Folger</a>, Professor P. R. Alger and naval constructor <a href="David%20W.%20Taylor">David W. Taylor</a>—an up-and-coming officer and future head of the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Construction%20and%20Repair">Bureau of Construction and Repair</a> (C&R). These comments expressed doubt that the proposed vessel could be modified into a feasible design, but they praised his thoughts as a step in the right direction. Alger believed that Signor was on the right track in suggesting larger armament, though he thought that triple turrets would be unworkable and eight 12-inch guns in four twin turrets would be a much more realistic arrangement. Naval historian <a href="Norman%20Friedman">Norman Friedman</a> believes that this was one of the "earliest serious proposals for a homogeneous big-gun battery."
The suggestion leading directly to the "South Carolina" class came from <a href="Homer%20Poundstone">Homer Poundstone</a>, a <a href="Lieutenant%20Commander%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant Commander</a> in the Navy, who became the principal proponent of an American all-big-gun design. In a December 1902 paper written for President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, he argued for greatly increasing the size of current battleships, although he also supported retaining mixed main batteries. However, by the March and June 1903 editions of "Proceedings", Poundstone began advocating for an all-big-gun arrangement, featuring twelve guns mounted on a ship. In October of the same year, the Italian naval architect <a href="Vittorio%20Cuniberti">Vittorio Cuniberti</a> presented a similar idea in an article for "<a href="Jane%27s%20Fighting%20Ships">Jane's Fighting Ships</a>" entitled "An Ideal Battleship for the British Navy". He argued in favor of a ship with twelve 12-inch guns on a slightly larger displacement than the battleships in service at the time, . He believed that the higher weight would allow 12 inches of armor and machinery capable of propelling the ship at . Poundstone used what he believed to be the great popularity for this idea among Europeans to justify the all-big-gun design.

In 1903, Poundstone's designs began receiving attention from American naval authorities. After being refined by <a href="Washington%20Irving%20Chambers">Washington Irving Chambers</a>, Poundstone's work was brought to the <a href="Naval%20War%20College">Naval War College</a>, where it was tested in <a href="Military%20simulation">war games</a> during the 1903 <a href="Newport%20Conference">Newport Conference</a>. The results indicated that a theoretical battleship that dispensed with the intermediate 8- and 7-inch armament and was armed with only twelve 11- or 12-inch guns, all able to fire on a single <a href="broadside">broadside</a>, was worth "three" of the battleships then in service. According to the men who conducted the tests, the main reasoning for the finding was that the measure of effective gun ranges was directly related to the maximum length of an enemy's torpedo range. At this time, the latter was roughly ; at that distance, the 7- and 8-inch guns common to American intermediate batteries would not be able to penetrate the armor of enemy battleships. Worse still, it was certain that—as the United States was developing a torpedo—gun range would have to rise in the near future, making the intermediate guns even less useful. However, a homogeneous main battery of 11- or 12-inch guns would be able to penetrate the armor and have sufficient explosive power to disable an enemy capital ship, and adding as many guns as possible would provide a strong defense against torpedo-carrying but unarmored <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s. As it turned out, events in the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> soon showed that naval battles could be fought at significantly greater distances than had been thought possible.

Faced with this evidence, the <a href="General%20Board%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Navy">General Board</a> sent a formal request in October 1903 to C&R, asking it to draw up plans for a battleship including these characteristics. No progress had been made by 26 January 1904, when the General Board asked C&R for a design including four 12-inch guns, eight 10-inch or larger guns, and no intermediate armament beyond 3-inch anti-destroyer guns. The move to only 10-inch weaponry was the result of doubt among naval authorities that heavier guns could physically be mounted on a ship's broadside. No action was taken on this request until September, when C&R began planning a ship with four 12-inch guns in dual turrets along with eight dual 10-inch or four single 12-inch guns.

Meanwhile, the Naval War College played three battleship designs against each other at its 1904 Newport Conference: the ships that were built following the 1903 conference; the new C&R design from September; and the latest battleships under construction, the "Connecticut" class. The 7- and 8-inch guns, and even the 10-inch guns, were demonstrated again to be unsatisfactory; even when hitting a battleship at the ideal angle of ° to its <a href="belt%20armor">belt</a>, they failed to pierce beyond 12 inches of <a href="Krupp%20armor">Krupp armor</a>—not enough to counter enemy capital ships. Speed calculations were also performed which demonstrated that even a advantage over an enemy fleet would be inconsequential in the final outcome of almost all naval battles because the slower ships could stay within range by turning on a tighter radius.

Within the naval bureaus, however, there was still much resistance. In mid-to-late 1904, Poundstone continued to lobby the General Board while C&R protested that the final determinant in a naval battle would be the light guns—and in any case such a large uniform battery was not feasible. Poundstone replied with a design of his own creation, which he called USS "Possible" and fit twelve 11-inch guns on a ship that displaced 19,330 long tons. With support from Lieutenant Commander <a href="William%20Sims">William Sims</a>, who was able to cite the increasingly accurate long-gunnery of the Navy, and interest shown in the project by President Roosevelt, the bureaucratic stalling ended.

On 3 March 1905, <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20United%20States">Congress</a> passed a bill that authorized the Navy to construct two new battleships to be named after the <a href="U.S.%20state">states</a> of <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> and <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. The maximum tonnage limit was set at 16000 long tons, the same weight as the mixed-battery "Connecticut" class of two years prior, in an attempt to stem the rising displacement—and accompanying costs—of the Navy's new capital ships. The provision was met with a mixed reception from naval designers. Some, including retired <a href="Admiral%20of%20the%20Navy%20%28United%20States%29">Admiral of the Navy</a> <a href="George%20Dewey">George Dewey</a>, thought the limit should have been set at the minimum standard of foreign battleships, or around . Others believed adding a significant amount of speed or firepower—something one would expect with an increase in tonnage—would require much more than 18,000 tons, and argued that the increase in size would buy nothing more than an increased target profile.

The Constructor of the Navy, Rear Admiral <a href="Washington%20L.%20Capps">Washington L. Capps</a>, devised an ambitious design that packed powerful armament and thick armor onto the small hull. He believed that future naval battles would involve fleets rather than single-ship actions, and so while the <a href="wing%20turret">wing turret</a>s so common in European designs were useful in the latter role for putting a maximum amount of firepower in any given direction, they were less so when operating as part of a <a href="line%20of%20battle">line of battle</a>. From this, Capps theorized that the principal concern of battleships was how much shell weight they could fire per broadside. The arrangement of <a href="superfire">superfiring</a> turrets placed on the centerline would allow the hull to be as short as possible while still having the most powerful broadside possible. A ship with its main battery placed along the center of the ship can focus the same amount of fire to port or starboard during a broadside. In contrast, <a href="wing%20turrets">wing turrets</a> had significant shortcomings: their location on the left or right of a ship's superstructure led to smaller possible broadsides, and the extreme weight placed on the sides of the ships led to torsional stress and rolling inertia.

As the additional main battery turrets with their associated magazines used a great amount of space within each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways to stay within the tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: there was no room for engines that could provide the same amount of power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at this point that he considered turbine propulsion. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.

The designers were running into the problem that Friedman calls the "squeeze": the essential elements of a battleship (armament, propulsion machinery, and armor) typically added up to about sixty percent of their design displacement; favoring one of these factors, the "three primary military qualities", would mean accepting compromises in one or both of the others.

In the end, the choice of armament and armor meant that the "South Carolina"s top speed was lower than HMS "Dreadnought", the namesake British ship built shortly before the "South Carolina"s, and all future US battleships.

At a design displacement of 16,000 long tons, the "South Carolina"-class dreadnoughts were the same size as their "Connecticut"-class pre-dreadnought predecessors. In service, they could actually be lighter: had a <a href="standard%20displacement">standard displacement</a> of , while "Michigan" was only by the same measurement. The ship's hull size was also comparable to the "Connecticut"s, with a length of <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>, <a href="length%20between%20perpendiculars">between perpendiculars</a>, and the same at the <a href="waterline%20length">waterline</a>. The class' <a href="beam%20%28ship%29">beam</a> was , <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draft</a> was , and <a href="metacentric%20height">metacentric height</a> was <a href="normal%20displacement">normally</a>, coming in slightly lower at when at <a href="full-load%20displacement">full load</a>. They were designed to carry about 869 men.

The "South Carolina"s had a propulsion system consisting of two <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">vertical triple-expansion steam engines</a> driving two 3-bladed <a href="Propeller">screws</a>. These were in turn powered by twelve coal-fired <a href="superheater">superheating</a> <a href="Babcock%20%26amp%3B%20Wilcox">Babcock & Wilcox</a> <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s located in three <a href="ship%20floodability">watertight compartments</a>. Together, they weighed , which was just over the specified contract limit. Traditional triple-expansion engines were installed rather than the <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s used in the British "Dreadnought". The actual coal capacity of the ships was at full load, slightly more than the designed maximum of , allowing for an endurance of at . While both ships surpassed in idealized trial conditions, the navy expected that the normal top speed would be around .

The class' <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> consisted of eight <a href="12%26quot%3B/45%20caliber%20Mark%205%20gun">/45</a> <a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">caliber</a> Mark 5 guns in four <a href="gun%20turret">turrets</a>, one pair fore and one aft, with 100 rounds for each gun. The guns were placed in an innovative superfiring arrangement, where one turret was mounted slightly behind and above the other. The anti-<a href="torpedo-boat">torpedo-boat</a> secondary armament of twenty-two <a href="3%26quot%3B/50%20caliber%20gun">guns</a> was mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s, and the two <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s were placed beneath the waterline, one on each side of the ship.

Armor on the "South Carolina" class was described by naval author Siegfried Breyer as "remarkably progressive", despite deficiencies in horizontal and underwater protection. The <a href="belt%20armor">belt</a> was thicker over the magazines, , than over the propulsion, , and in front of the forward magazines, . The casemates were also protected with 10 to 8 inches of armor, while the <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck armor</a> varied from . The turrets and conning tower had the heaviest armor, with 12–8–2.5 inches (face/side/roof; 305–203–63.5 mm) and , respectively. The barbettes were protected with 10 to 8 inches of armor. The total weight of the armor amounted to 31.4% of the design displacement, slightly more than the next three battleship classes.

The contracts for the class were awarded on 20 and 21 July, respectively. Without armor or armament, "South Carolina" would cost $3,540,000, while "Michigan" would come in at $3,585,000. With armor and armament, the ships cost about $7,000,000 each.
"Michigan"s <a href="keel">keel</a> was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> on 17 December 1906, one day before "South Carolina". After the initial construction periods, the ships were launched on 26 May and 11 July 1908 (respectively). "Michigan" was slightly more than half complete when launched, and the ship was christened by Carol Newberry, the daughter of Assistant Secretary of the Navy <a href="Truman%20Handy%20Newberry">Truman Handy Newberry</a>. The warship was billed as epoch-making, and the spectacle drew many prominent individuals, including the governor and lieutenant-governor of Michigan, the governor of New Jersey, the mayor of <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, and the secretary of the Interior Department, along with many naval admirals and constructors. Like its sister ship, "South Carolina" was just over halfway completed when it was launched. The accompanying ceremony took place just after noon and was attended by many notable residents of the state of South Carolina, including Governor <a href="Martin%20Frederick%20Ansel">Martin Frederick Ansel</a>. His daughter Frederica <a href="ship%20christening">christened</a> the ship.

After their <a href="fitting-out">fitting-out</a> stage, the two ships were put through <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s to ensure they met their contracted specifications. The first attempt at putting "Michigan" through a trial was conducted at the navy's traditional testing grounds off <a href="Rockland%2C%20Maine">Rockland, Maine</a>, beginning on 9 June 1909. Although the ship completed its standardization run, other tests were disrupted when it ran aground on a <a href="sand%20bar">sand bar</a>. Although "Michigan" was pulled off without incident, the navy soon discovered that both propellers required repair, delaying the completion of the trials until 20–24 June. The battleship was commissioned several months later on 4 January 1910—making the United States the third country to have a dreadnought in commission, behind the United Kingdom and Germany, but just ahead of Brazil's —and its <a href="shakedown%20cruise">shakedown cruise</a> lasted until 7 June.

"South Carolina"s trials were conducted off the Delaware Capes beginning on 24 August 1909, and its standardization runs were slightly faster than "Michigan"s. After final modifications at William Cramp, "South Carolina" was commissioned on 1 March 1910 and departed for a shakedown cruise six days later.

After being commissioned, both ships were assigned to the <a href="United%20States%20Fleet%20Forces%20Command">US Atlantic Fleet</a>. The two operated up and down the American <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">east coast</a> from July until November. On 2 November, as part of the Second Battleship Division, the ships left the <a href="Boston%20Navy%20Yard">Boston Navy Yard</a> for a training voyage to Europe, where they visited the <a href="Isle%20of%20Portland">Isle of Portland</a> in the United Kingdom and <a href="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a> in France. In January 1911, they returned to the US naval base in <a href="Guantanamo%20Bay">Guantanamo Bay</a>, Cuba, before continuing to <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>. After further maneuvers, the two ships split up; "Michigan" remained on the east coast, while "South Carolina" embarked on another trip to Europe. The ship visited <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> (Denmark), <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> (Sweden), <a href="Kronstadt">Kronstadt</a> (Russia), and <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> (Germany)—the last during <a href="Kiel%20Week">"Kieler Woche"</a>, a large <a href="regatta">sailing event</a>—before returning in July 1911.

"South Carolina" next took part in the 1911 <a href="naval%20review">naval review</a> in New York, before several months of traveling to ports on the east coast and welcoming a visiting German naval squadron including the battlecruiser and two <a href="light%20cruisers">light cruisers</a>. After a three-month overhaul in Norfolk, "South Carolina" joined "Michigan" on a cruise to <a href="Pensacola%2C%20Florida">Pensacola</a>, <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, <a href="Galveston%2C%20Texas">Galveston</a>, and <a href="Veracruz%2C%20Veracruz">Veracruz</a> in Mexico, as part of the <a href="Special%20Service%20Squadron">Special Service Squadron</a>. "South Carolina" later visited <a href="Colon%2C%20Panama">Colón</a>, <a href="Panama">Panama</a>, in January 1913. Both ships continued their previous service of visiting east coast ports before unrest in Mexico and the Caribbean caused the American government to order them away. "South Carolina" landed marines on Haiti on 28 January to protect the American delegation there. They returned to the ship when <a href="Oreste%20Zamor">Oreste Zamor</a> took power, but continued disorder later led the United States to <a href="United%20States%20occupation%20of%20Haiti">occupy Haiti</a>. "South Carolina" then joined "Michigan" at Veracruz while the United States <a href="United%20States%20occupation%20of%20Veracruz">occupied that city</a>.

At the beginning of the First World War, both of the "South Carolina"-class battleships were grouped with two older pre-dreadnoughts ( and "Connecticut") due to their top speeds, which were lower than all subsequent US battleships. "South Carolina" was <a href="refit">refit</a>ted in Philadelphia between 14 October and 20 February 1915, and both ships were kept on neutrality patrols on the American side of the Atlantic, even after the US <a href="American%20entry%20into%20World%20War%20I">entered the war</a> on 6 April 1917. In January 1918, "Michigan" was training with the main fleet when it traveled through a strong storm. The high winds and waves caused its forward <a href="Lattice%20mast">cage mast</a> to collapse, killing six and injuring thirteen.

On 6 September 1918, "South Carolina" escorted a fast convoy partway across the Atlantic, becoming one of the first American battleships (alongside and ) to do so. When returning to the United States, "South Carolina" lost its starboard propeller. When continuing with the port propeller, a valve in its engine malfunctioned; continuing with an auxiliary valve caused a large amount of vibration, so the ship was stopped just hours later for temporary repairs on the main valve before continuing to the Philadelphia Naval Yard for repairs. "Michigan" had the same problem when escorting a convoy in the next month; the ship lost its port propeller on 8 October, but managed to return home on 11 October without further incident. After the war's end on 11 November 1918, both "South Carolina"-class battleships were used to repatriate American soldiers that had been fighting in the war.
In the years after the war, the two battleships were used for training cruises. The terms of the 1922 <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>, which limited naval construction to avert a vastly expensive naval <a href="arms%20race">arms race</a>, also called for disposing of dozens of older battleships in the signatories' navies. "South Carolina" was decommissioned on 15 December 1921, shortly before the end of the conference, and its sister followed on 11 February 1922, days after the treaty was signed.

Clemuel Ricketts Mansion

The Clemuel Ricketts Mansion (also known as the Stone House, the William R. Ricketts House, and Ganoga) is a <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian-style</a> house made of <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, built in 1852 or 1855 on the shore of <a href="Ganoga%20Lake">Ganoga Lake</a> in <a href="Colley%20Township%2C%20Sullivan%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Colley Township</a>, <a href="Sullivan%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Sullivan County</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> in the United States. It was home to several generations of the Ricketts family, including <a href="R.%20Bruce%20Ricketts">R. Bruce Ricketts</a> and <a href="William%20Reynolds%20Ricketts">William Reynolds Ricketts</a>. Originally built as a hunting lodge, it was also a tavern and post office, and served as part of a hotel for much of the 19th century.

After 1903 the house served as the Ricketts family's summer home; they kept it even as they sold over to the state of Pennsylvania from 1920 to 1950. The house was included in the <a href="Historic%20American%20Buildings%20Survey">Historic American Buildings Survey</a> (HABS) in 1936 and listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> (NRHP) in 1983. A group of investors bought the lake, surrounding land, and house in 1957 and developed them privately for housing and recreation. The house became the Ganoga Lake Association's clubhouse, and is not open to the public.

The original mansion is an L-shaped structure, two-and-a-half stories high, with stone walls thick. It was built in a clearing surrounded by <a href="old-growth%20forest">old-growth forest</a> with a view to the lake to the east. In 1913 a -story wing was added to the north side of the house and the original structure was renovated. The house has seven rooms, four porches, and its original hardware and woodwork. <a href="Dormer">Dormer</a>s and some windows were added in the renovation, and electrical wiring and modern plumbing have been added since. According to the NRHP nomination form, the Clemuel Ricketts Mansion "is a stunning example of Georgian vernacular architecture".

The Clemuel Ricketts Mansion is on the southwest shore of <a href="Ganoga%20Lake">Ganoga Lake</a> in <a href="Colley%20Township%2C%20Sullivan%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Colley Township</a> in the southeastern part of <a href="Sullivan%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Sullivan County</a>. The mansion and lake are on a part of the <a href="Allegheny%20Plateau">Allegheny Plateau</a> known as North Mountain; the plateau formed about 300 to 250 million years ago in the <a href="Alleghenian%20orogeny">Alleghenian orogeny</a>. Rocks—gray sandstone with <a href="conglomerate%20%28geology%29">conglomerates</a> and some <a href="siltstone">siltstone</a>—of the <a href="Mississippian%20age">Mississippian</a> <a href="Pocono%20Formation">Pocono Formation</a> more than 340 million years old, underlie the house and lake. The lake is in a shallow valley, deep, which is impounded by <a href="till">glacial till</a> up to thick at the southeast end, where <a href="Kitchen%20Creek%20%28Pennsylvania%29">Kitchen Creek</a> exits.

The earliest recorded inhabitants of the region were the <a href="Susquehannock">Susquehannock</a>s, who left or died out by 1675. The land then came under the control of the <a href="Iroquois">Iroquois</a>, who sold it to the British in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Stanwix">Treaty of Fort Stanwix</a> in 1768. The land on which the house was later built was first part of <a href="Northumberland%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Northumberland County</a>, then became part of <a href="Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lycoming County</a> in 1795. The Susquehanna and Tioga <a href="toll%20road">Turnpike</a>, which followed the lake's western shore, was built between 1822 and 1827; it connected the Pennsylvania communities of <a href="Berwick%2C%20Pennsylvania">Berwick</a> in the south and <a href="Towanda%2C%20Pennsylvania">Towanda</a> in the north. The lake was then known as Long Pond, and the Long Pond Tavern, just north of where the house was later built, was a lunch stop for the stagecoach on the turnpike. Sullivan County was formed from Lycoming County in 1847, and two years later Colley Township was formed from <a href="Cherry%20Township%2C%20Sullivan%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Cherry Township</a>.

Brothers Clemuel Ricketts (1794–1858) and Elijah G. Ricketts (1803–1877) were frustrated at having to spend the night on a hotel's parlor floor while on a hunting trip on <a href="Loyalsock%20Creek">Loyalsock Creek</a> north of Ganoga Lake in 1850, and wanted their own hunting preserve. They bought the lake, Long Pond Tavern, and of surrounding land in the early 1850s and soon began building a stone house between the turnpike and the lake shore to replace the log tavern. According to <a href="William%20Reynolds%20Ricketts">William Reynolds Ricketts</a>' HABS history of the house, Petrillo's history of the region "Ghost Towns of North Mountain", and the house's NRHP nomination form, the Ricketts brothers bought the lake and surrounding land in 1851, began building the stone house that year, and finished it in 1852. The year 1852 is also carved in stone on the front (west side) of the house, which faced the highway. However, according to Tomasak's "The Life and Times of Robert Bruce Ricketts", the brothers purchased the lake, tavern, and land on April 13, 1853, for $550 (approximately $ in 2019), and had the house built from 1854 to 1855.

According to Ricketts family tradition, Gad Seward built the mansion. While it was originally known as "Ricketts Folly" for its isolated location in the wilderness, the official name was the Stone House. The house served as the brothers' lodge and as a tavern for travelers on the turnpike. Clemuel was named <a href="postmaster">postmaster</a> of a new post office at the lake on October 3, 1853, and received a tavern license from Sullivan County on August 7, 1854. When Clemuel died in 1858, Elijah bought his share of the house and land. The post office closed April 12, 1860.

Elijah's son <a href="R.%20Bruce%20Ricketts">Robert Bruce Ricketts</a> (1839–1918), for whom the nearby <a href="Ricketts%20Glen%20State%20Park">Ricketts Glen State Park</a> is named, joined the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> as a private at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, and rose through the ranks to become a colonel in the artillery. After the war, R. B. Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and purchased the stone house, lake, and some of the land around it from his father on September 25, 1869, for $3,969.81 (approximately $ in 2019); eventually he controlled or owned more than , including the lake and the park's glens and <a href="Waterfalls%20in%20Ricketts%20Glen%20State%20Park">waterfalls</a>.

From 1872 to 1875 Ricketts and his partners operated a <a href="sawmill">sawmill</a> southeast of his house. In 1872 Ricketts used lumber from the mill to build a three-story wooden addition about north of the stone house, with a <a href="verandah">verandah</a> connecting the two. The addition cost $45,000 (approximately $ in 2019), and was known as the Ark for its resemblance to <a href="Noah%27s%20Ark">Noah's Ark</a>. That same year Ricketts put new <a href="white%20birch">white birch</a> floors in the stone house, which are still there as of 2008.

The Ark and stone house together formed the North Mountain House hotel, which opened in 1873, and was managed by Ricketts' brother Frank until 1898. Many of the guests, who came from <a href="Wilkes-Barre%2C%20Pennsylvania">Wilkes-Barre</a>, <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, and other places, were Ricketts' friends and relations. The hotel was open year-round; in summer, guests frequently arrived after school let out in June and stayed until school resumed in September. In 1876 and 1877, Ricketts ran the first summer school in the United States at his house and hotel; one of the teachers was <a href="Joseph%20Rothrock">Joseph Rothrock</a>, later known as the "Father of Forestry" in Pennsylvania.

By 1874 Ricketts had renamed Long Pond as Highland Lake, and by 1875 had named the highest waterfall on Kitchen Creek as Ganoga Falls. That year the North Mountain House hotel was featured in <a href="John%20B.%20Bachelder">John B. Bachelder</a>'s travel guide "Popular resorts, and how to reach them", which praised its location in a <a href="old-growth%20forest">virgin forest</a>, the lake and nearby waterfalls, and opportunities for hunting, fishing, and hiking. In 1881, Ricketts renamed Highland Lake as Ganoga Lake. Pennsylvania senator <a href="Charles%20R.%20Buckalew">Charles R. Buckalew</a> suggested the name "Ganoga", an Iroquoian word which he said meant "water on the mountain" in the <a href="Seneca%20language">Seneca language</a>.
The house and hotel were on the east side of the old turnpike; a field on the other side of the road had a small herd of milk cows and a vegetable garden to provide for the guests' needs. The field also had a <a href="rifle%20range">rifle range</a> and a nine-hole <a href="golf%20course">golf course</a>. Guests could enjoy tennis and <a href="croquet">croquet</a>, and a lawn stretched from the house east to the lake, which offered boating and <a href="bathing">bathing</a>. There was an <a href="wikt%3Aoutlook">outlook</a> point southwest of the house, and Ricketts built a observation tower at the highest point on North Mountain, south. After the first tower collapsed, he built a replacement, and named the site Grand View.

Ricketts was a lumberman who made his fortune <a href="clearcutting">clearcutting</a> nearly all his land, but no logging was allowed within of the lake, and the glens and their waterfalls in the state park were "saved from the lumberman's axe through the foresight of the Ricketts family". One hemlock tree cut near the lake to clear land for a building in 1893 was in diameter and 532 years old. The North Mountain House hotel was threatened by a forest fire in 1900; the subsequent loss of much of the surrounding old-growth forest led to decreased numbers of hotel guests. Changing tastes may have also played a role in the decline in popularity; the hotel had over 150 guests in August 1878, but only about 70 guests in August 1894.
In 1903 another large fire on North Mountain threatened the sawmill in the lumber town of <a href="Ricketts%2C%20Pennsylvania">Ricketts</a> northeast of the lake. Beginning in 1893, a branch line of the <a href="Lehigh%20Valley%20Railroad">Lehigh Valley Railroad</a> ran from Ricketts to a log station at the north end of the lake; a <a href="boardwalk">boardwalk</a> and coach service brought guests from the station to the hotel. There was daily passenger service to Wilkes-Barre and Towanda, and the line also served freight trains hauling ice from the lake for use in refrigeration from 1895.

The North Mountain House was long known for its rustic charms; it was heated with open fireplaces, decorated with animal skins and hatracks made of antlers, and had two live <a href="American%20black%20bear">black bears</a> on chains in the field across the road from the house. In 1895 and 1900 the stone house was refurbished, and telephone service, <a href="Carbide%20lamp">acetylene lighting</a>, and <a href="Radiator%20%28heating%29%23Steam">steam heat</a> were added. In 1900 "The Sullivan Review" newspaper recalled its former state and wrote of the changes: "We hardly call that an improvement. ... When the North Mountain House is lighted by gas, heated by a modern furnace, etc., its great charm is gone."

The wooden addition to the stone house was torn down in either 1897 or 1903, and the land became a garden. The hotel closed in November 1903, and passenger train service ended at that time. The sawmills at Ricketts closed when the timber was exhausted in 1913, and the ice company closed in 1915. The stone house remained the Ricketts' summer home. Ricketts proposed moving the highway from his front yard in 1904; the <a href="Pennsylvania%20General%20Assembly">Pennsylvania General Assembly</a> approved this in 1908, after he paid for the construction of the new highway, east of the house. Thomas Henry Atherton of Wilkes-Barre was the architect for a new wing that was added to the stone house in 1913, as well as renovations to the original structure. Ricketts died in 1918 at the stone house; his wife died a few days after and they are buried in the small Ricketts family cemetery near the north end of the lake. As part of Ricketts' <a href="will%20%28law%29">will</a>, the stone house and its outbuildings were valued at $12,000 in 1918 (approximately $ in 2019).
R. B. Ricketts and his wife had three children; their son <a href="William%20Reynolds%20Ricketts">William Reynolds Ricketts</a> (1869–1956) lived in the house after his parents' deaths. Beginning in 1920, the Ricketts heirs began selling land to the state of Pennsylvania, but still owned over surrounding the house, Ganoga Lake, and the glens with their waterfalls. The stone house was included in the <a href="Historic%20American%20Buildings%20Survey">Historic American Buildings Survey</a> (HABS) in 1936 as the William R. Ricketts House. Atherton, the architect for the 1913 addition, helped prepare the HABS architectural drawings, which gave the house's name as "Ganoga". William Reynolds Ricketts' history for the HABS refers to it as the stone house. The area was approved as a <a href="national%20park">national park</a> site in the 1930s; a 1935 article in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported that the federal government planned to purchase in the area, mentioning the waterfalls and the Ricketts estate and house, which it called "the oldest stone hotel in Pennsylvania". The <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> operated a <a href="Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> camp at "Ricketts Glynn" ("<a href="sic">sic</a>"), but budget problems and <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> brought an end to national plans for development.

In 1942 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania began buying the glens and their waterfalls from the heirs for $82,000 (approximately $ in 2019) and opened Ricketts Glen State Park in 1944; from 1920 to 1950 the state bought more than from the Ricketts family for the park and <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20Game%20Lands">Pennsylvania State Game Lands</a>. William Reynolds Ricketts died in 1956 and the lake and surrounding land were sold in October 1957 for $109,000 (approximately $ in 2019). The Department of Forests and Waters (predecessor of the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Department%20of%20Conservation%20and%20Natural%20Resources">Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources</a>) bid on the including the house and lake, but were outbid by a group of private investors. These "formed the Lake Ganoga Association in September 1959 to regulate and preserve the recreation and residential facilities at Lake Ganoga". The association built a road around the lake, cleared some land at its southern end, and its members built about 50 houses on the lake shore. In 1983 the stone house was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> as the Clemuel Ricketts Mansion; it serves as the association's headquarters and clubhouse, and is used for association meetings, weddings, and picnics. As part of a private development, the house and lake are not open to the public: "To all outsiders that have no property around the lake, the lake and grounds are off limits."

Clemuel Ricketts, the architect of the stone house, was very interested in architecture from the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">colonial period</a> and had traveled widely. In the 1840s he published a book which examined the British and European sources of colonial architecture in the United States. Clemuel designed the house in the colonial or <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> style in the early 1850s; construction began in either 1851 or 1854 and finished the next year.

The Clemuel Ricketts Mansion lies west of Ganoga Lake, on what the HABS map described as a "clearing completely surrounded by primeval forest", with a view to the lake. The house was originally on the east side of the turnpike and faced it, but when what became Pennsylvania Route 487 was built in 1907, the course of the highway was changed so that it now runs on the other (east) side of the lake. Since then, the house is on a private road from the highway.

The original house built in the 1850s is L-shaped. According to the architectural drawings made for the HABS, the bottom of the L is north–south by east–west. In 1935 the ground floor of this part of the house included the main door and entrance hall, living room, parlor, library, and stairs. The main entrance is on the west side, which has a porch wide by deep, supported by pairs of square pillars with stairs on the north, south, and west sides. The top of the L is north–south by east–west, and in 1935 the ground floor of the top of the L had the dining room, gun room, "brush up room", toilet, stairs, and a passage to the 1913 addition. The inside corner of the L has a two-story covered porch along the south side, and an open terrace on the east side's ground floor. In 1935 the second story of the original house had four bedrooms and a bathroom in the lower part of the L and two bedrooms and a bath in the upper part, as well as two staircases and hallways.
The mansion's stone walls are thick; the individual building stones are "field sandstone about 17 inches square, of various thicknesses" (17 inches is 43 cm). There is a basement below the original house. The lower part of the L is five <a href="bay%20%28architecture%29">bays</a> by two bays; the original double-hung <a href="sash%20window">sash window</a>s in each bay of the 1850s house have six panes of glass per sash. All the original windows have <a href="window%20shutter">shutters</a>, these are paneled on the first floor and louvered on the second. The main door is in the <a href="Federal%20architecture">Federal style</a> with a large <a href="fanlight">fanlight</a> above the door and <a href="sidelight">sidelight</a>s on either side. The attic in the 1850s part of the house is not finished, and the <a href="gable">gable roof</a> has "boxed <a href="cornice">cornice</a>s with returns".

In 1897 or 1903 a formal garden was added north of the stone house, on the site of the razed wooden structure where most of the hotel guests had stayed. In 1913 a two-and-half story wing was added on the north side of the original house, which was renovated; Thomas Henry Atherton was the architect. The new wing is north–south and east–west, with a large enclosed one-story porch on the north and east sides. In 1935 the addition had the kitchen, pantry, storage and refrigeration rooms, and a "maid's dining room" on the first floor, two bedrooms and a bathroom on the second floor, and two servant rooms and a bath in the finished attic.

The new wing has six <a href="dormer">dormer</a>s (three on a side), and six dormers were added to the old house in the 1913 renovation (four on the east side, two on the west). The windows on the first floor of the new wing matched the old windows, but the windows in the second story of the addition have twelve panes in the upper sash and eight in the lower. As part of the renovation work, four new windows were placed in the 1850s house: two just west of the new wing, and two on the east wall of the lower part of the L. A small porch was added in the corner where the west wall of the new wing meets the north wall of the old house, and all the old porches were restored. In the original house two chimneys were restored and two replaced, and new fireplaces were installed in the living room, library, and dining room. The house has a total of 28 rooms.

The NRHP nomination form lists two other structures on the property: a utility building made of brick and covered in <a href="stucco">stucco</a> east of the house, and a large barn to the southwest. Since the house's 1913 renovation, the only changes have been the installation of electrical wiring and modernization of the plumbing. The original hardware and woodwork are still present inside the house. According to the NRHP nomination form, the Clemuel Ricketts Mansion "is a stunning example of Georgian vernacular architecture" which "represents the manifestations of one man's architectural dream preserved within the wilderness for over a century".

Mantis

Mantises are an <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">order</a> (Mantodea) of <a href="insect">insect</a>s that contains <a href="List%20of%20mantis%20genera%20and%20species">over 2,400 species in about 430 genera</a> in 15 families. The largest family is the <a href="Mantidae">Mantidae</a> ("mantids"). Mantises are distributed worldwide in <a href="Temperate%20climate">temperate</a> and <a href="Tropics">tropical</a> habitats. They have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks. Their elongated bodies may or may not have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged and adapted for catching and gripping prey; their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name praying mantis.

The closest relatives of mantises are the <a href="termite">termite</a>s and <a href="cockroach">cockroach</a>es (<a href="Blattodea">Blattodea</a>), which are all within the <a href="superorder">superorder</a> <a href="Dictyoptera">Dictyoptera</a>. Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects (<a href="Phasmatodea">Phasmatodea</a>), other elongated insects such as <a href="grasshopper">grasshopper</a>s (<a href="Orthoptera">Orthoptera</a>), or other unrelated insects with <a href="raptorial">raptorial</a> forelegs such as mantisflies (<a href="Mantispidae">Mantispidae</a>). Mantises are mostly <a href="ambush%20predator">ambush predator</a>s, but a few ground-dwelling species are found actively pursuing their prey. They normally live for about a year. In cooler climates, the adults lay eggs in autumn, then die. The eggs are protected by their hard capsules and hatch in the spring. Females sometimes practice <a href="sexual%20cannibalism">sexual cannibalism</a>, eating their mates after copulation.

Mantises were considered to have <a href="Supernatural">supernatural powers</a> by early civilizations, including <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greece</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>, and <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>. A cultural <a href="trope%20%28literature%29">trope</a> popular in <a href="cartoon">cartoon</a>s imagines the female mantis as a "<a href="femme%20fatale">femme fatale</a>". Mantises are among the insects most commonly kept as <a href="pet">pet</a>s.

Over 2,400 species of mantis in about 430 genera are recognized. They are predominantly found in tropical regions, but some live in temperate areas. The <a href="systematics">systematics</a> of mantises have long been disputed. Mantises, along with stick insects (Phasmatodea), were once placed in the order <a href="Orthoptera">Orthoptera</a> with the cockroaches (now Blattodea) and rock crawlers (now <a href="Grylloblattodea">Grylloblattodea</a>). Kristensen (1991) combined the Mantodea with the cockroaches and <a href="termite">termite</a>s into the order <a href="Dictyoptera">Dictyoptera</a>, suborder Mantodea. The name "mantodea" is formed from the Ancient Greek words ("mantis") meaning "prophet", and ("eidos") meaning "form" or "type". It was coined in 1838 by the German entomologist <a href="Hermann%20Burmeister">Hermann Burmeister</a>. The order is occasionally called the mantes, using a Latinized plural of Greek "mantis". The name mantid properly refers only to members of the family <a href="Mantidae">Mantidae</a>, which was, historically, the only family in the order. The other common name, praying mantis, applied to any species in the order (though in Europe mainly to "<a href="Mantis%20religiosa">Mantis religiosa</a>"), comes from the typical "<a href="prayer">prayer</a>-like" posture with folded forelimbs. The vernacular plural "mantises" (used in this article) was confined largely to the US, with "mantids" predominantly used as the plural in the UK and elsewhere, until the family Mantidae was further split in 2002.

One of the earliest classifications splitting an all-inclusive Mantidae into multiple families was that proposed by Beier in 1968, recognizing eight families, though it was not until Ehrmann's reclassification into 15 families in 2002 that a multiple-family classification became universally adopted. Klass, in 1997, studied the external male genitalia and postulated that the families <a href="Chaeteessidae">Chaeteessidae</a> and <a href="Metallyticidae">Metallyticidae</a> diverged from the other families at an early date. However, the Mantidae and <a href="Thespidae">Thespidae</a> are still both considered <a href="polyphyletic">polyphyletic</a>, so the Mantodea will have to be revised.

The earliest mantis fossils are about 135 million years old, from Siberia. Fossils of the group are rare: by 2007, only about 25 fossil species were known. Fossil mantises, including one from Japan with spines on the front legs as in modern mantises, have been found in <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> amber. Most fossils in amber are nymphs; compression fossils (in rock) include adults. Fossil mantises from the <a href="Crato%20Formation">Crato Formation</a> in Brazil include the long "<a href="Santanmantis%20axelrodi">Santanmantis axelrodi</a>", described in 2003; as in modern mantises, the front legs were adapted for catching prey. Well-preserved specimens yield details as small as 5 μm through <a href="X-ray%20computed%20tomography">X-ray computed tomography</a>.

Because of the superficially similar <a href="raptorial">raptorial</a> <a href="forelegs">forelegs</a>, <a href="Mantispidae">mantidflies</a> may be confused with mantises, though they are unrelated. Their similarity is an example of <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>; mantidflies do not have <a href="tegmen">tegmina</a> (leathery forewings) like mantises, their antennae are shorter and less thread-like, and the raptorial <a href="Arthropod_leg%23Tibia">tibia</a> is more muscular than that of a similar-sized mantis and bends back further in preparation for shooting out to grasp prey.

The "Mantodea Species File" lists the following living (with at least 2 extinct) families:

Mantises have large, triangular heads with a beak-like snout and <a href="mandible">mandible</a>s. They have two bulbous <a href="compound%20eyes">compound eyes</a>, three small simple eyes, and a pair of <a href="Antenna%20%28biology%29">antennae</a>. The articulation of the neck is also remarkably flexible; some species of mantis can rotate their heads nearly 180°.
The mantis thorax consists of a <a href="prothorax">prothorax</a>, a <a href="mesothorax">mesothorax</a>, and a <a href="metathorax">metathorax</a>. In all species apart from the genus "<a href="Mantoida">Mantoida</a>", the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is much longer than the other two thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing for a wide range of movements of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.

Mantises have two spiked, grasping forelegs ("raptorial legs") in which prey items are caught and held securely. In most insect legs, including the posterior four legs of a mantis, the <a href="Arthropod%20leg%23Coxa">coxa</a> and <a href="Arthropod%20leg%23Trochanter">trochanter</a> combine as an inconspicuous base of the leg; in the raptorial legs, however, the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment about as long as the <a href="Arthropod%20leg%23Femur">femur</a>, which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus (see illustration). Located at the base of the femur is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the foreleg of the mantis its grasp on its prey. The foreleg ends in a delicate <a href="Arthropod%20leg">tarsus</a> used as a walking appendage, made of four or five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no <a href="arolium">arolium</a>.

Mantises can be loosely categorized as being macropterous (long-winged), brachypterous (short-winged), micropterous (vestigial-winged), or apterous (wingless). If not wingless, a mantis has two sets of wings: the outer wings, or <a href="tegmen">tegmina</a>, are usually narrow and leathery. They function as camouflage and as a shield for the hind wings, which are clearer and more delicate.
The abdomen of all mantises consists of 10 <a href="Tergum">tergites</a>, with a corresponding set of nine <a href="Sternum%20%28arthropod%20anatomy%29">sternites</a> visible in males and seven visible in females. The abdomen tends to be slimmer in males than females, but ends in a pair of <a href="cercus">cerci</a> in both sexes.

Mantises have <a href="stereopsis">stereo vision</a>. They locate their prey by sight; their compound eyes contain up to 10,000 <a href="Ommatidium">ommatidia</a>. A small area at the front called the fovea has greater visual acuity than the rest of the eye, and can produce the high resolution necessary to examine potential prey. The peripheral ommatidia are concerned with perceiving motion; when a moving object is noticed, the head is rapidly rotated to bring the object into the visual field of the fovea. Further motions of the prey are then tracked by movements of the mantis's head so as to keep the image centered on the fovea. The eyes are widely spaced and <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location">laterally</a> situated, affording a wide <a href="binocular%20vision">binocular field of vision</a> and precise stereoscopic vision at close range. The dark spot on each eye that moves as it rotates its head is a <a href="pseudopupil">pseudopupil</a>. This occurs because the ommatidia that are viewed "head-on" absorb the <a href="incident%20light">incident light</a>, while those to the side reflect it.

As their hunting relies heavily on vision, mantises are primarily <a href="diurnality">diurnal</a>. Many species, however, fly at night, and then may be attracted to artificial lights. Mantises in the family <a href="Liturgusidae">Liturgusidae</a> collected at night have been shown to be predominately males; this is probably true for most mantises. Nocturnal flight is especially important to males in locating less-mobile females by detecting their <a href="pheromone">pheromone</a>s. Flying at night exposes mantises to fewer bird predators than diurnal flight would. Many mantises also have an auditory thoracic organ that helps them avoid bats by detecting their <a href="Animal%20echolocation">echolocation</a> calls and responding evasively.

Mantises are generalist <a href="predator">predator</a>s of arthropods. The majority of mantises are <a href="ambush%20predator">ambush predator</a>s that only feed upon live prey within their reach. They either camouflage themselves and remain stationary, waiting for prey to approach, or stalk their prey with slow, stealthy movements. Larger mantises sometimes eat smaller individuals of their own species, as well as small vertebrates such as lizards, frogs, small birds and fishes.

Most mantises stalk tempting prey if it strays close enough, and will go further when they are especially hungry. Once within reach, mantises strike rapidly to grasp the prey with their spiked raptorial forelegs. Some ground and bark species pursue their prey in a more active way. For example, members of a few genera such as the ground mantises, "Entella", "Ligaria", and "Ligariella" run over dry ground seeking prey, much as <a href="tiger%20beetle">tiger beetle</a>s do.
The fore gut of some species extends the whole length of the insect and can be used to store prey for digestion later. This may be advantageous in an insect that feeds intermittently. <a href="Chinese%20mantis">Chinese mantis</a>es live longer, grow faster, and produce more young when they are able to eat <a href="pollen">pollen</a>.

Mantises are preyed on by vertebrates such as frogs, lizards, and birds, and by invertebrates such as spiders, <a href="Asian_giant_hornet%23Predation">large species of hornets</a>, and ants. Some hunting wasps, such as some species of "<a href="Tachytes">Tachytes</a>" also paralyse some species of mantis to feed their young. Generally, mantises protect themselves by camouflage, most species being cryptically colored to resemble <a href="leaf">foliage</a> or other backgrounds, both to avoid predators and to better snare their prey. Those that live on uniformly colored surfaces such as bare earth or tree bark are dorsoventrally flattened so as to eliminate shadows that might reveal their presence. The species from different families called <a href="flower%20mantis">flower mantis</a>es are <a href="aggressive%20mimicry">aggressive mimics</a>: they resemble flowers convincingly enough to attract prey that come to collect pollen and nectar. Some species in Africa and Australia are able to turn black after a molt towards the end of the dry season; at this time of year, bush fires occur and this coloration enables them to blend in with the fire-ravaged landscape (<a href="Melanism%23Adaptive%20melanism">fire melanism</a>).

When directly threatened, many mantis species stand tall and spread their forelegs, with their wings fanning out wide. The fanning of the wings makes the mantis seem larger and more threatening, with some species enhancing this effect with bright colors and patterns on their hind wings and inner surfaces of their front legs. If harassment persists, a mantis may strike with its forelegs and attempt to pinch or bite. As part of the bluffing (<a href="deimatic">deimatic</a>) <a href="threat%20display">threat display</a>, some species may also produce a hissing sound by expelling air from the abdominal <a href="spiracle">spiracle</a>s. Mantises lack chemical protection, so their displays are largely bluff. When flying at night, at least some mantises are able to detect the echolocation sounds produced by bats; when the frequency begins to increase rapidly, indicating an approaching bat, they stop flying horizontally and begin a descending spiral toward the safety of the ground, often preceded by an aerial loop or spin. If caught, they may slash captors with their raptorial legs.

Mantises, like <a href="stick%20insect">stick insect</a>s, show rocking behavior in which the insect makes rhythmic, repetitive side-to-side movements. Functions proposed for this behavior include the enhancement of <a href="crypsis">crypsis</a> by means of the resemblance to vegetation moving in the wind. However, the repetitive swaying movements may be most important in allowing the insects to discriminate objects from the background by their relative movement, a visual mechanism typical of animals with simpler sight systems. Rocking movements by these generally sedentary insects may replace flying or running as a source of relative motion of objects in the visual field. As ants may be predators of mantises, genera such as "<a href="Loxomantis">Loxomantis</a>", "<a href="Orthodera">Orthodera</a>", and "<a href="Statilia">Statilia</a>", like many other arthropods, avoid attacking them. Exploiting this behavior, a variety of arthropods, including some early-instar mantises, <a href="ant%20mimicry">mimic ants</a> to evade their predators.

The mating season in temperate climates typically takes place in autumn, while in tropical areas, mating can occur at any time of the year. To mate following courtship, the male usually leaps onto the female's back, clasping her thorax and wing bases with his forelegs. He then arches his abdomen to deposit and store sperm in a special chamber near the tip of the female's abdomen. The female lays between 10 and 400 eggs, depending on the species. Eggs are typically deposited in a froth mass-produced by <a href="gland">gland</a>s in the abdomen. This froth hardens, creating a protective capsule, which together with the egg mass is called an <a href="ootheca">ootheca</a>. Depending on the species, the ootheca can be attached to a flat surface, wrapped around a plant, or even deposited in the ground. Despite the versatility and durability of the eggs, they are often preyed on, especially by several species of <a href="parasitoid%20wasp">parasitoid wasp</a>s. In a few species, mostly ground and bark mantises in the family <a href="Tarachodidae">Tarachodidae</a>, the mother guards the eggs. The cryptic "<a href="Tarachodes%20maurus">Tarachodes maurus</a>" positions herself on bark with her abdomen covering her egg capsule, ambushing passing prey and moving very little until the eggs hatch. An unusual reproductive strategy is adopted by <a href="Brunneria%20borealis">Brunner's stick mantis</a> from the southern United States; no males have ever been found in this species, and the females breed <a href="Parthenogenesis">parthenogenetically</a>. The ability to reproduce by parthenogenesis has been recorded in at least two other species, "<a href="Sphodromantis%20viridis">Sphodromantis viridis</a>" and "Miomantis" sp., although these species usually reproduce sexually. In temperate climates, adults do not survive the winter and the eggs undergo a <a href="diapause">diapause</a>, hatching in the spring.

As in closely related insect groups in the superorder Dictyoptera, mantises go through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult (mantises are among the <a href="hemimetabolism">hemimetabolous</a> insects). For smaller species, the eggs may hatch in 3–4 weeks as opposed to 4–6 weeks for larger species. The nymphs may be colored differently from the adult, and the early stages are often mimics of ants. A mantis nymph grows bigger as it <a href="ecdysis">molts</a> its <a href="exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>. Molting can happen five to 10 times before the adult stage is reached, depending on the species. After the final molt, most species have wings, though some species remain wingless or brachypterous ("short-winged"), particularly in the female sex. The lifespan of a mantis depends on the species; smaller ones may live 4–8 weeks, while larger species may live 4–6 months.

Sexual cannibalism is common among most predatory species of mantises in captivity. It has sometimes been observed in natural populations, where about a quarter of male-female encounters result in the male being eaten by the female. Around 90% of the predatory species of mantises participate in sexual cannibalism. Adult males typically outnumber females at first, but their numbers may be fairly equivalent later in the adult stage, possibly because females selectively eat the smaller males. In "<a href="Tenodera%20sinensis">Tenodera sinensis</a>", 83% of males escape cannibalism after an encounter with a female, but since multiple matings occur, the probability of a male's being eaten increases cumulatively.

The female may begin feeding by biting off the male's head (as they do with regular prey), and if mating has begun, the male's movements may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm. Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a <a href="ganglion">ganglion</a> in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior appeared to be an artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights or moving scientists. Chinese mantises that had been fed "<a href="ad%20libitum">ad libitum</a>" (so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed. The male engages the female in a courtship dance, to change her interest from feeding to mating. Under such circumstances, the female has been known to respond with a defensive deimatic display by flashing the colored eyespots on the inside of her front legs.

The reason for sexual cannibalism has been debated; experiments show that females on low quality diets have a higher chance to engage in sexual cannibalism compared to females on high quality diets. Some consider that submissive males gain a selective advantage by producing offspring. This theory is supported by a quantifiable increase in the duration of copulation among males which are cannibalized, in some cases doubling both the duration and the chance of fertilization. This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution, and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time, indicating that males that actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females. The same study also found that hungry females generally attracted fewer males than those that were well fed. The act of dismounting after copulation is dangerous for males, for at this time, females most frequently cannibalize their mates. An increase in mounting duration appears to indicate that males wait for an opportune time to dismount a hungry female, who would be likely to cannibalize her mate.

One of the earliest mantis references is in the ancient Chinese dictionary "<a href="Erya">Erya</a>", which gives its attributes in poetry, where it represents courage and fearlessness, and a brief description. A later text, the ("Great History of Medical Material Annotated and Arranged by Types, Based upon the Classics and Historical Works") from 1108, gives accurate details of the construction of the egg packages, the development cycle, anatomy, and the function of the antennae.
Although mantises are rarely mentioned in Ancient Greek sources, a female mantis in threat posture is accurately illustrated on a series of fifth-century BC silver coins, including <a href="didrachm">didrachm</a>s, from <a href="Metapontum">Metapontum</a> in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>.
In the 10th century AD, <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> era "Adages", <a href="Suda">Suidas</a> describes an insect resembling a slow-moving green locust with long front legs. He translates <a href="Zenobius">Zenobius</a> 2.94 with the words "seriphos" (maybe a mantis) and "graus", an old woman, implying a thin, dried-up stick of a body.

Western descriptions of the biology and morphology of the mantises became more accurate in the 18th century. <a href="August%20Johann%20R%C3%B6sel%20von%20Rosenhof">Roesel von Rosenhof</a> illustrated and described mantises and their cannibalistic behavior in the "" ("Insect Entertainments").
<a href="Aldous%20Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a> made philosophical observations about the nature of death while two mantises mated in the sight of two characters in his 1962 novel "<a href="Island%20%28Huxley%20novel%29">Island</a>" (the species was "<a href="Gongylus%20gongylodes">Gongylus gongylodes</a>"). The naturalist <a href="Gerald%20Durrell">Gerald Durrell</a>'s humorously autobiographical 1956 book "<a href="My%20Family%20and%20Other%20Animals">My Family and Other Animals</a>" includes a four-page account of an almost evenly matched battle between a mantis and a <a href="gecko">gecko</a>. Shortly before the fatal "<a href="d%C3%A9nouement">dénouement</a>", Durrell narrates:

<a href="M.%20C.%20Escher">M. C. Escher</a>'s woodcut "Dream" depicts a human-sized mantis standing on a sleeping bishop. The 1957 film "<a href="The%20Deadly%20Mantis">The Deadly Mantis</a>" features a mantis as a <a href="Monster%20movie">giant monster</a>.

A cultural <a href="Trope%20%28literature%29">trope</a> imagines the female mantis as a "<a href="femme%20fatale">femme fatale</a>". The idea is propagated in cartoons by Cable, Guy and Rodd, LeLievre, T. McCracken, and Mark Parisi, among others. It ends <a href="Isabella%20Rossellini">Isabella Rossellini</a>'s short film about the life of a praying mantis in her 2008 "<a href="Green%20Porno">Green Porno</a>" season for the <a href="SundanceTV">Sundance Channel</a>.

Two <a href="martial%20arts">martial arts</a> separately developed in China have movements and fighting strategies based on those of the mantis. As one of these arts was developed in northern China, and the other in southern parts of the country, the arts are today referred to (both in English and Chinese) as '<a href="Northern%20Praying%20Mantis">Northern Praying Mantis</a>' and '<a href="Southern%20Praying%20Mantis">Southern Praying Mantis</a>'. Both are very popular in China, and have also been exported to the West in recent decades.

The mantis was revered by the southern African <a href="Khoi">Khoi</a> and <a href="Bushmen">San</a> in whose cultures man and nature were intertwined; for its praying posture, the mantis was even named "" ("god of the Khoi") in the <a href="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a> language that had developed among the first European settlers. However, at least for the San, the mantis was only one of the manifestations of a trickster-deity who could assume many other forms, such as a snake, hare or vulture. Several ancient civilizations did consider the insect to have supernatural powers; for the Greeks, it had the ability to show lost travelers the way home; in the <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>ian "<a href="Book%20of%20the%20Dead">Book of the Dead</a>" the "bird-fly" is a minor god that leads the souls of the dead to the underworld; in a list of 9th-century BC <a href="Nineveh">Nineveh</a> grasshoppers ("buru"), the mantis is named <a href="Necromancy">necromancer</a> ("buru-enmeli") and <a href="Divination">soothsayer</a> ("buru-enmeli-ashaga").

Mantises are among the insects most widely kept as pets. Because the lifespan of a mantis is only about a year, people who want to keep mantises often breed them. In 2013 at least 31 species were kept and bred in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. In 1996 at least 50 species were known to be kept in captivity by members of the Mantis Study Group. "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" described the "giant Asian praying mantis" as "part stick insect with a touch of Buddhist monk", and stated that they needed a <a href="vivarium">vivarium</a> around 30 cm (12 in) on each side. "The Daily South" argued that a pet insect was no weirder than a pet rat or <a href="ferret">ferret</a>, and that while a pet mantis was unusual, it would not "bark, shed, [or] need shots or a litter box".

Gardeners who prefer to avoid <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s may encourage mantises in the hope of controlling insect pests. However, mantises do not have key attributes of <a href="biological%20pest%20control">biological pest control</a> agents; they do not specialize in a single pest insect, and do not multiply rapidly in response to an increase in such a prey species, but are general predators. They eat whatever they can catch, including both harmful and beneficial insects. They therefore have "negligible value" in biological control.

Two species, the Chinese mantis and the European mantis, were deliberately introduced to North America in the hope that they would serve as pest controls for agriculture; they have spread widely in both the United States and Canada.

A prototype <a href="robot">robot</a> inspired by the forelegs of the praying mantis has front legs that allow the robot to <a href="walking">walk</a>, climb steps, and grasp objects. The multi-jointed leg provides dexterity via a rotatable joint. Future models may include a more spiked foreleg to improve the grip and ability to support more weight.

Ragnar Garrett

<a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28Australia%29">Lieutenant General</a> Sir Alwyn Ragnar Garrett, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">KBE</a>, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">CB</a> (12 February 1900 – 4 November 1977) was a senior commander in the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a>. He served as <a href="Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the General Staff</a> (CGS) from 1958 to 1960.

Born in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, Garrett graduated from the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, in 1921. He was <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a> and <a href="quartermaster">quartermaster</a> in several <a href="regiment">regiment</a>s of the <a href="Australian%20Light%20Horse">Australian Light Horse</a> before undertaking staff training in England, which he completed just as the Second World War broke out. Garrett joined the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a> soon afterwards, and commanded the <a href="2/31st%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/31st Battalion</a> in England before seeing action with Australian <a href="brigade">brigade</a>s in <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Crete">Crete</a> in 1941. Promoted to <a href="colonel">colonel</a> the following year, he held senior positions with <a href="I%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">I Corps</a> in <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea</a> and <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">II Corps</a> on <a href="Bougainville%20Campaign">Bougainville</a> in 1944–1945. He was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> for his staff work.

After the war, Garrett served two terms as commandant of the <a href="Army%20Command%20and%20Staff%20College%2C%20Queenscliff">Staff College, Queenscliff</a>, in 1946–1947 and 1949–1951. Between these appointments he was posted to Japan with the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a>. Promoted to <a href="major%20general">major general</a>, he took charge of <a href="5th%20Military%20District%20%28Australia%29">Western Command</a> in August 1951, and became <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the General Staff</a> in January 1953. He took over Southern Command as a <a href="lieutenant%20general">lieutenant general</a> in October 1954, and was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in 1957. As CGS from March 1958, Garrett focused on rearmament and reorganisation, initiating the Army's short-lived restructure into a "<a href="Pentropic%20organisation">pentropic</a>" formation. He was <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">knighted</a> in 1959. After retiring from the military in June 1960, Garrett became <a href="honorary%20colonel">honorary colonel</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Regiment">Royal Australian Regiment</a>, and was principal of the Australian Administrative Staff College until 1964. He died at <a href="Mornington%2C%20Victoria">Mornington</a>, Victoria, in 1977.

Born on 12 February 1900 in <a href="Northam%2C%20Western%20Australia">Northam</a>, Western Australia, Alwyn Ragnar Garrett was the son of accountant Alwyn Garrett and his Swedish wife Maria Carolina ("<a href="n%C3%A9e">née</a>" Wohlfahrt). Ragnar attended <a href="Guildford%20Grammar%20School">Guildford Grammar School</a> before entering the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, in 1918. He graduated in 1921 and was posted to the <a href="Australian%20Light%20Horse">Australian Light Horse</a> as a <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a>. In November 1922, Garrett was appointed <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a>/<a href="quartermaster">quartermaster</a> of the <a href="23rd%20Light%20Horse%20Regiment%20%28Australia%29">23rd Light Horse Regiment</a>. The following month he served as an extra <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a> to the new <a href="Governor%20of%20South%20Australia">Governor of South Australia</a>, General <a href="Tom%20Bridges">Sir Tom Bridges</a>. In November 1923, Garrett was seconded to the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>, and spent the next twelve months attached to the <a href="2nd%20Dragoon%20Guards%20%28Queen%27s%20Bays%29">2nd Dragoon Guards</a> in <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>, India. On his return to Australia in January 1925, he was reappointed adjutant/quartermaster of the 23rd Light Horse. He married Shirley Lorraine Hunter, a nurse, on 9 September at St Peter's Anglican Church in the <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> suburb of <a href="Glenelg%2C%20South%20Australia">Glenelg</a>; the couple had a son and a daughter. Garrett became adjutant/quartermaster of the <a href="9th%20Light%20Horse%20Regiment%20%28Australia%29">9th Light Horse Regiment</a> at <a href="Jamestown%2C%20South%20Australia">Jamestown</a>, South Australia, in February 1926. He was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a> in November 1929.

In March 1930, Garrett was posted as adjutant/quartermaster to the <a href="3rd%20Light%20Horse%20Regiment%20%28Australia%29">3rd Light Horse Regiment</a> at <a href="Mount%20Gambier%2C%20South%20Australia">Mount Gambier</a>, South Australia. As a speaker at Mount Gambier's <a href="Anzac%20Day">Anzac Day</a> commemorations on 25 April 1934, he was reported as warning of the poor state of Australia's preparedness for war, admonishing: "We shall not have the time that we had before the last war, and we shall not be fighting for our homes thousands of miles away. We shall be fighting at our own back door. That is what we have to prepare for." In August that year he was transferred to the <a href="4th%20Light%20Horse%20Regiment%20%28Australia%29">4th Light Horse Regiment</a> at <a href="Warrnambool">Warrnambool</a>, Victoria, as adjutant/quartermaster. Garrett was posted to the staff of Army Headquarters, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, in March 1936, and departed for England in November the following year to attend the <a href="Staff%20College%2C%20Camberley">Staff College, Camberley</a>. He was promoted to <a href="major">major</a> in July 1938, and returned to Australia upon the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">outbreak of the Second World War</a>.

Garrett joined the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a> in November 1939, and was appointed <a href="brigade%20major">brigade major</a> of the <a href="18th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">18th Brigade</a> under Brigadier <a href="Leslie%20Morshead">Leslie Morshead</a> in January 1940. The brigade departed for the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Middle East</a> in May but, owing to the military situation following the <a href="Fall%20of%20France">Fall of France</a>, it was diverted to Britain, arriving in June. Garrett was promoted <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> on 16 September and took command of the <a href="2/31st%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/31st Battalion</a> the same day; he handed over to <a href="Selwyn%20Porter">Selwyn Porter</a> in February 1941, and departed England for the Middle East. From March to June he served as General Staff Officer Grade 2 (Operations) of <a href="I%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">I Corps</a> under Lieutenant General <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Sir Thomas Blamey</a>. In April Garrett was briefly seconded to Savige Force, which <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">fought in Greece</a> under Brigadier <a href="Stanley%20Savige">Stanley Savige</a>. Savige recorded that when Garrett was posted back to corps headquarters, it "affected me more than the bombing ... I was very sorry to lose Garrett, who served me splendidly over the hectic days of the recent past". Garrett was also attached to the <a href="19th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">19th Brigade</a> in <a href="Battle%20of%20Crete">Crete</a>.

Returning to Australia, Garrett was promoted to temporary <a href="colonel">colonel</a> in April 1942 and became senior operations officer in the <a href="1st%20Armoured%20Division%20%28Australia%29">1st Armoured Division</a>, which served as a garrison force in case of Japanese invasion. He was posted to Army Headquarters, Melbourne, in October as Director of Armoured Fighting Vehicles. In September 1943, he was appointed General Staff Officer Grade 1 (Operations) of I Corps under Lieutenant General <a href="Edmund%20Herring">Sir Edmund Herring</a> in <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea</a>. Three months later he was promoted to temporary <a href="brigadier">brigadier</a> and became Brigadier General Staff of I Corps. He continued to serve in that position as I Corps was redesignated <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">II Corps</a> in April 1944, <a href="New%20Guinea%20Force">New Guinea Force</a> the following month, and finally II Corps again in October 1944 for the campaign on <a href="Bougainville%20Campaign">Bougainville</a> under Lieutenant General Savige. The campaign was controversial in that it appeared to have little impact on the main drive against Japan; Garrett was quoted as calling it "an absolute waste of time".

Garrett was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> for his "skill, direction, and supervision of the highest order" in having "prepared and guided all staff work to meet every conceivable requirement in the complete reorganisation of forces in New Guinea"; the honour was promulgated in "<a href="The%20London%20Gazette">The London Gazette</a>" on 19 July 1945. Garrett was also responsible for interrogating the first Japanese peace envoy to make contact with the Australians on Bougainville, on 18 August 1945, and was present when the instrument of surrender was signed on 8 September. In November 1945, he took command of the <a href="8th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">8th Brigade</a> in New Guinea. He oversaw the brigade's return to Australia before its disbandment in March 1946. His "exceptional service in the field" in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific Area</a> earned him a <a href="mention%20in%20despatches">mention in despatches</a>, which was gazetted on 6 March 1947 and backdated to 2 November 1946.

Following a three-month course at the Staff College, Camberley, Garrett was appointed commandant of the <a href="Army%20Command%20and%20Staff%20College%2C%20Queenscliff">Staff College, Queenscliff</a>, Victoria, in June 1946. He was posted to Japan in March 1947, becoming Brigadier-in-Charge of Administration for the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a> in July. The size and scope of the occupation declined considerably during his tour, which finished in October 1949. Approximately 2,400 Australians, most from the <a href="67th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">67th Battalion</a>, remained by late 1948, compared to 11,000 in October 1946. In December 1949, Garrett resumed command of the Staff College, Queenscliff. Promoted temporary <a href="major%20general">major general</a>, he was appointed <a href="General%20Officer%20Commanding">General Officer Commanding</a> (GOC) <a href="5th%20Military%20District%20%28Australia%29">Western Command</a>, which covered the state of <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, in August 1951. He became <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the General Staff</a> in February 1953.

In December 1953, Garrett succeeded Major General <a href="Eric%20Woodward">Eric Woodward</a> as Adjutant-General and Second Military Member of the Military Board. He was promoted temporary <a href="lieutenant%20general">lieutenant general</a> in October 1954 and appointed GOC Southern Command, which covered <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>, and <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and was, as of April 1953, the superior headquarters for several major <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Citizen Military Forces</a> (CMF) formations including the <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">3rd Infantry Division</a>, the <a href="4th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">4th</a> and <a href="6th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">6th Infantry Brigades</a>, the <a href="2nd%20Armoured%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">2nd Armoured Brigade</a>, and two artillery groups. His elevation to lieutenant general was made permanent in December 1954. Garrett was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in the <a href="1957%20Birthday%20Honours">Queen's Birthday Honours</a> on 13 June 1957. He succeeded Lieutenant General <a href="Henry%20Wells%20%28general%29">Sir Henry Wells</a> as <a href="Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the General Staff</a> (CGS) on 23 March 1958. Garrett was raised to <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the <a href="1959%20New%20Year%20Honours">1959 New Year Honours</a>.

The Army underwent significant change during Garrett's term as CGS. In March 1959, he chaired the first meeting of the Military Board at the new Army Headquarters in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>, following its move from Melbourne. <a href="Alan%20Stretton">Alan Stretton</a>, executive officer to the Military Board at the time, recalled Garrett's sense of humour and "most informal" manner. In August, the CGS announced to his senior officers a radical reorganisation of the Army that would strengthen the regular forces and reduce reliance on the CMF, which since <a href="Federation%20of%20Australia">Federation</a> had formed the backbone of Australia's military. This plan included the abolition of <a href="National%20Service%20Act%201951">National Service</a>, to which the Federal government had already agreed, and the introduction of a "<a href="Pentropic%20organisation">pentropic</a>" divisional structure. Garrett championed the pentropic structure to overcome what he saw as the weakness of the traditional battalion for overseas deployments, and to ensure compatibility with the <a href="US%20Army">US Army</a>'s <a href="pentomic">pentomic</a> formations. The Australian Army's traditional "triangular" divisional structure of three infantry battalions under a brigade headquarters was to be replaced with an organisation consisting of five larger battalions (hence "pentropic") without a brigade layer between division and battalion headquarters. The plan was opposed by CMF officers as it would result in the disbandment of the citizens' brigades and many of the old militia battalions. Under the new structure the CMF would not only shrink, its units would lose traditional ties to local communities through the establishment of new multi-battalion state-based regiments, leading to suspicion in some quarters that the entire process was designed to demolish the CMF.
Garrett was concerned not only with changing the Army's organisation but with upgrading its equipment; by the early 1960s the Army would acquire the <a href="FN%20FAL">FN 7.62mm rifle</a>, the <a href="M60%20machine%20gun">M60 machine gun</a>, the <a href="M101%20howitzer">M101 105mm howitzer</a>, the <a href="M113%20armoured%20personnel%20carrier">M113 armoured personnel carrier</a>, and new mortars and radios. He also advocated strongly for the Army to operate its own helicopters and light aircraft; the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Aviation%20Corps">Australian Army Aviation Corps</a> was eventually established in July 1968. Garrett was scheduled to retire from the Army on his sixtieth birthday in February 1960 but the government extended his term. He retired on 30 June 1960 and was succeeded by Lieutenant General <a href="Reg%20Pollard%20%28general%29">Reg Pollard</a>, whom Garrett had recommended for the post in the face of opposition from the <a href="Department%20of%20the%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Minister for the Army</a>, <a href="John%20Cramer%20%28Australian%20politician%29">John Cramer</a>, who had attempted to appoint Major General <a href="Ivan%20Dougherty">Ivan Dougherty</a>, a retired CMF officer. Although Garrett's proposed reorganisation of the Army along pentropic lines went ahead under Pollard, it proved short-lived. The US Army abandoned the system in June 1961, and the Australian Army returned to the triangular formation following a review commissioned by Pollard's successor as CGS, Lieutenant General <a href="John%20Wilton%20%28general%29">Sir John Wilton</a>, in October 1964.

On retiring from the military, Garrett became principal of the Australian Administrative Staff College, a private institution delivering courses to senior business and government personnel at <a href="Mount%20Eliza%2C%20Victoria">Mount Eliza</a>, Victoria. During his four-year tenure, he lobbied for the reintroduction of conscription, and when the Federal government brought in a new <a href="National%20Service%20Act%201964">selective service scheme</a> in 1965, he was invited to draw the first ballot of names. Garrett also recommended that the Army should have a division prepared for war at all times. He served as <a href="honorary%20colonel">honorary colonel</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Regiment">Royal Australian Regiment</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Western%20Australia%20Regiment">Royal Western Australia Regiment</a> from 1960 until 1965, when he was appointed Chairman of the Western Australian Coastal Shipping Commission, a position he held until 1970. He died on 4 November 1977 at <a href="Mornington%2C%20Victoria">Mornington</a>, Victoria, and was cremated. His wife had died earlier, and he was survived by his two children.

Sinistar: Unleashed

Sinistar: Unleashed is a 1999 action <a href="space%20shooter">space shooter</a> video game for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>. It was designed by Marc Michalik and Walter Wright and developed at GameFX, a small studio composed of former members of <a href="Looking%20Glass%20Studios">Looking Glass Studios</a>. Originally titled "Out of the Void", development of the project began in 1997 and had no relationship with the "<a href="Sinistar">Sinistar</a>" franchise. After licensing the franchise from <a href="Midway%20Games">Midway Games</a> that year, GameFX shifted the focus of the game and developed it as a sequel to the original "Sinistar", which was released by <a href="Williams%20%28gaming%20company%29">Williams</a> in 1982.

Like the previous installment, "Sinistar: Unleashed" focuses on the destruction of the Sinistar, a large bio-mechanical machine, powered by machines called the Sporg. To achieve this goal, the player has a variety of starships, power-ups and weapons. Unlike its predecessor, the game has full <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional graphics</a> and a wider control scheme. "Sinistar: Unleashed" features 29 levels, five of which are hidden; each level has a Sinistar.

"Sinistar: Unleashed" received mixed reception when released. Critics lauded its audacity, as well as the addition of new features into the game. Several journalists felt that GameFX captured all the elements that represented a "Sinistar" game and stayed true to the franchise by feeling familiar to fans of the original game. However, critics faulted the <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss</a> designs and the repetitiveness of the gameplay.

Like its predecessor, "Sinistar: Unleashed" is an action <a href="space%20shooter">space shooter</a> video game. While the original "Sinistar" features graphics and gameplay in a <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">two-dimensional</a> space, the sequel features <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional graphics</a> and gameplay, giving the player the ability to maneuver and roam freely across six different axes. "Sinistar: Unleashed" features twenty-nine <a href="level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a>, five of which are hidden as a bonus; each level has a Sinistar. The bonus levels are timed missions that involve destroying or protecting a particular object.

The player is given a starship, and the main mission is to fight an alien race called the Distilled Evil and their slaves, the Sporg. The Sporg are mining ships controlled by the Distilled Evil, tasked with powering the jumpgate, a portal through which the Sinistar (a bio-mechanical monster dedicated to destroying the player) appears. The jumpgate is stationed at the center of the level, and the Sporg power it with energy crystals collected from the asteroids that appear sparsely along the sector.

The player must prevent the Sporg from completely powering the jumpgate. While completing the task, the player encounters several warships that attempt to protect the jumpgate. These enemies are indicated on the radar with a dynamic set of coordinates that turn from white to red as they approach. If the player succeeds, the jumpgate breaks and the level is finished. Otherwise, the Sinistar will arrive through the activated jumpgate, and the player must defeat it to progress further. The player has six different starships to choose from, as well as eight <a href="power-up">power-up</a>s and nine weapons to destroy the mining ships and the Sinistar. The most powerful weapon is called the Sinibomb, which is designed to defeat the Sinistar, although it can also be used to destroy the jumpgate. The player obtains Sinibombs by harvesting crystals from asteroids in the same way Sporg do.

Development of "Sinistar: Unleashed", originally titled "Out of the Void", began in 1997. It was handled by GameFX, a small game developer consisting of former members of <a href="Looking%20Glass%20Studios">Looking Glass Studios</a>. It was initially designed to run only on a P200 with <a href="3dfx">3dfx</a> acceleration, hardware which was beyond the reach of the average consumer at the time. Recognizing that the game could serve as a showpiece for their chip, 3dfx partnered with GameFX to support development. At first, the project had no connection, or gameplay similarities, to the "Sinistar" franchise. When the studio acquired the rights for the "Sinistar" franchise that year, it decided to refocus the development of the title to fit into the newly acquired property. It altered the game to introduce similarities to "Sinistar", although the graphic structure remained unchanged.

THQ revealed that the game was optimized for the then-recently released <a href="Pentium%20III">Pentium III</a> processors from <a href="Intel">Intel</a> to allow the "lighting and geometry transformation engine to process more detail faster." In the "Computer Gamer's Bible", Mark L. Chambers and Rob Smith noted the technical design of "Sinistar: Unleashed", writing that "developers have added accurate collision physics, and mining the asteroid field will require precise timing and good trigger finger."

"Sinistar: Unleashed" was announced by <a href="THQ">THQ</a> in February 1999, two years after the company licensed the "Sinistar" franchise from Midway Games. Two demos for the game were produced. The second, released in September 1999, included several gameplay and technical enhancements over the first, showcasing the initial two levels of the game.

When announcing the game, C. Noah Davis, chief technology officer of THQ and general manager of GameFX, said "What made the original a classic is that it was easy to learn, yet difficult to master." He elaborated: "We are focused on capturing that magic using many elements of the original, while showcasing the universe using our proprietary GameFX Technology." IGN reported on September 3, 1999 that the game had <a href="gone%20gold">gone gold</a> (its development had concluded), and it was released worldwide on September 15.

"Sinistar: Unleashed" received mixed to positive reviews from media outlets, gaining an average score of 65.75% according to review aggregator <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a>. Critics agreed that the developers stayed true to the original game and lauded the graphic enhancements as "unquestionably beautiful" and a "graphical powerhouse". <a href="Erik%20Wolpaw">Erik Wolpaw</a>, writing for <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>, noted that the game suffered mostly from gameplay issues, such as the control design, which he called "overly complex for a mindless shooter". He added that although the developers succeeded in capturing the arcade essence of the previous game, this was "somewhat to the detriment of the final product."

<a href="AllGame">AllGame</a>'s reviewer was satisfied with the game's graphics but criticized how its bosses were designed, elaborating that "the Sinistars ... simply don't instill the same sense of sheer panic [as in the previous game]." Vincent Lopez from <a href="IGN">IGN</a> noted the game's similarity to its predecessor and complimented its graphics and the addition of a wide variety of weapons as well as other technical features. However, he viewed the weapons as "more of a checklist than an actual asset." He stated that "Sinistar: Unleashed" "feels immediately familiar to fans of the original, while adding just enough new features (and a completely new graphic overhaul) to make this feel now-dated."

Nash Werner from "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" shared Lopez's views, explaining that GameFX, along with THQ, "have released a modern 3D version" of the original "Sinistar" that "sports some of the best graphics ever seen in a space shooter", although he added that it had lost "some of the soul" that the original game had. Bob Mandel from The Adrenaline Vault was impressed with the game. Although he agreed that there would "certainly be both buyers and reviewers who will bash this title mercilessly, bemoaning the absence of complicated missions and tactical planning", he stated that with "Sinistar: Unleashed", GameFX and THQ managed to create a "true arcade classic". He saw it as the only remake of a game from the 1980s to achieve that status.

Caryn Law, writing for "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Magazine</a>", applauded THQ for including the original game's elements and rendering them with "jazzing" graphics. She criticized the plot and gameplay design, stating that "players want games that involve more than simply blowing things up." She also contended that "Sinistar: Unleashed" "hearkens back to the days when all you needed was keen hand–eye coordination and a pocket full of quarters." Chris McMullen from "Games Domain" discussed the game's technical aspects in his review, maintaining that it "not only sounds and looks good" but is also "fun to play and strangely addictive." However, he cited the gameplay's repetitiveness as a flaw that prevented "Sinistar: Unleashed" from "being a must-buy game."

"<a href="PC%20Zone">PC Zone</a>" praised the game, noting that "the rich, organic style lends the game a hypnotic atmosphere" and stating "with the Sinistars still taunting you as they did back in 1983, and the gameplay essentially unchanged, those who enjoyed the ageing classic will find "Sinistar: Unleashed" a worthy successor." John Lee, writing for "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>", gave a somewhat mediocre review of the game, casting it as "a lot like one of those "Baywatch" babes—luscious to look at, but not much between the ears." He added that it was basically "another retro/nostalgia trip." <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>'s Caryn Law concluded that "Sinistar: Unleashed" was "simply "Sinistar" dressed up in 3D graphics" and that it offered "nothing new in the way of a challenge."

Westcott railway station

Westcott railway station was a small <a href="train%20station">station</a> built to serve the village of <a href="Westcott%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Westcott, Buckinghamshire</a>, and nearby buildings attached to <a href="Ferdinand%20James%20von%20Rothschild">Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild</a>'s estate at <a href="Waddesdon%20Manor">Waddesdon Manor</a>. It was built by the <a href="Richard%20Temple-Grenville%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Chandos">Duke of Buckingham</a> in 1871 as part of a short <a href="horsecar">horse-drawn</a> <a href="tramway%20%28industrial%29">tramway</a> to allow for the transport of goods from and around his extensive estates in <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a> and to connect the Duke's estates to the <a href="Aylesbury%20and%20Buckingham%20Railway">Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway</a> at <a href="Quainton%20Road%20railway%20station">Quainton Road</a>. A lobbying campaign by residents of the town of <a href="Brill%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Brill</a> led to the tramway being converted for passenger use and extended to <a href="Brill%20railway%20station">Brill railway station</a> in 1872, becoming known as the <a href="Brill%20Tramway">Brill Tramway</a>.

Cheaply built and <a href="land%20grading">ungraded</a>, and using poor quality <a href="locomotive">locomotive</a>s, services on the line were very slow, initially limited to . In the 1890s it was planned to extend the tramway to <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>, but the scheme was abandoned. Instead, the operation of the line was taken over by the <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway">Metropolitan Railway</a> in 1899.

Following the 1933 transfer of the Metropolitan Railway to public ownership to become the <a href="Metropolitan%20line">Metropolitan line</a> of <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Transport</a>, Westcott station became a part of the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>, despite being over from central London. The management of London Transport believed it very unlikely that the line could ever be made viable, and Westcott station was closed, along with the rest of the line, from 30 November 1935. The <a href="station%20building">station building</a> and its associated house are the only significant buildings from the Brill Tramway to survive other than the former <a href="junction%20station">junction station</a> at Quainton Road.

On 23 September 1868 the small <a href="Aylesbury%20and%20Buckingham%20Railway">Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway</a> (A&BR) opened, linking the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a>'s station at <a href="Aylesbury%20railway%20station">Aylesbury</a> to the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway">London and North Western Railway</a>'s <a href="Varsity%20Line">Oxford to Bletchley line</a> at <a href="Verney%20Junction%20railway%20station">Verney Junction</a>. On 1 September 1894 London's <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway">Metropolitan Railway</a> (MR) reached Aylesbury, and shortly afterwards connected to the A&BR line, with local MR services running to Verney Junction from 1 April 1894. Through trains from the MR's London terminus at <a href="Baker%20Street%20tube%20station">Baker Street</a> commenced on 1 January 1897.
<a href="Richard%20Plantagenet%20Campbell%20Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Chandos">Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos</a>, had long had an interest in railways, and had served as Chairman of the London and North Western Railway from 1852 to 1861. In the early 1870s he decided to build a <a href="light%20railway">light railway</a> to carry freight from his estates in Buckinghamshire to the A&BR's line at <a href="Quainton%20Road%20railway%20station">Quainton Road</a>.
The first stage of the line, known as the <a href="Brill%20Tramway">Wotton Tramway</a>, was a line from Quainton Road via <a href="Wotton%20%28Metropolitan%20Railway%29%20railway%20station">Wotton</a> to a coal siding at <a href="Kingswood%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Kingswood</a>, and opened on 1 April 1871. Intended for use by <a href="Horsecar">horse trams</a>, the line was built with <a href="baulk%20road">longitudinal sleepers</a> to avoid horses tripping on the sleepers.

Lobbying from the nearby town of <a href="Brill%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Brill</a> for the introduction of passenger services on the line led to an extension from Wotton to <a href="Brill%20railway%20station">Brill railway station</a>, at the foot of <a href="Brill%20Hill">Brill Hill</a> of a mile (1.2 km) from the hilltop town of Brill itself, in the summer of 1872 and the introduction of two <a href="mixed%20train">mixed train</a>s each day in each direction, at which time the line was renamed the <a href="Brill%20Tramway">Brill Tramway</a>. The Duke bought two <a href="Aveling%20and%20Porter">Aveling and Porter</a> <a href="traction%20engine">traction engine</a>s modified to work as locomotives for the line, each with a top speed of , although a speed limit of was enforced.
The Duke died in 1889, and in 1894 the <a href="trustee">trustee</a>s of his <a href="estate%20%28law%29">estate</a> set up the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O&ATC) with the intention of extending the line from Brill to <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>. The MR leased the Brill Tramway from 1 December 1899, although the line continued to be owned by the O&ATC.

Westcott station was the second station from Quainton Road, about east of Quainton Road. The station consisted of a single platform with a small wooden station building, and was immediately south of the village of <a href="Westcott%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Westcott</a>, which at the time of the railway's opening had a population of about 150. Initially named "Westcott Siding", the station was renamed "Westcott" shortly after opening. The station was initially built with a single low wooden platform, primarily intended for loading and unloading freight. After the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the MR introduced a single <a href="Brown%2C%20Marshalls%20and%20Co.%20Ltd.">Brown Marshall</a> passenger carriage on the line; at this time, a short section of platform was raised to conventional height to allow access to the higher doors on the new carriage.

Limited by poor quality locomotives and the bumpy, cheaply laid track which followed the contours of the hills, trains ran very slowly in the area; in 1882 trains took 20 minutes to travel the short distance from Quainton Road to Westcott, and 50 minutes from Westcott to Brill.

From 1872 to 1894 Westcott station was served by two passenger trains per day in each direction, and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day. Following the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day in each direction until closure in 1935. Improvements to the line carried out at the time of the transfer to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad reduced journey times from Westcott to Quainton Road and Brill to 13 minutes and 28 minutes respectively.
Passenger trains generally served the station only on weekdays, although between 1903 and 1922 trains also ran on Sundays. While the village of Westcott was small, the proximity of <a href="Ferdinand%20James%20von%20Rothschild">Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild</a>'s estate at <a href="Waddesdon%20Manor">Waddesdon Manor</a> made Westcott one of the busier stations on the branch in terms of passenger and goods traffic.

Despite the low frequency of service and relatively low numbers of people using the station, Westcott station was staffed; the single employee's responsibilities included maintaining the <a href="oil%20lamp">oil lamp</a>s on the platform and working a nearby <a href="level%20crossing">level crossing</a> gate. As with all employees on the line, staff at the station were contractually obliged to "devote themselves exclusively to the service, attend regularly during the appointed hours and to refrain from using improper language, cursing or swearing". The single member of staff was provided with a house immediately adjacent to the station; built by the Duke of Buckingham, the house bears the inscription "B&C" (<a href="Viscount%20Cobham%23Dukes%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Chandos%20%281822%29">Buckingham & Chandos</a>).

A small <a href="gasworks">gasworks</a> a short distance to the south of Westcott station opened in 1889 to provide power to Waddesdon Manor and to other buildings on the Rothschild's estate. A short <a href="spur%20line">spur line</a> was built from Westcott station to the gasworks, running immediately parallel to the road south from Westcott village. In 1926 the gasworks closed and was replaced by an electrical generator elsewhere on the Waddesdon Manor grounds, and the track of the spur was removed.

On 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan Railway, along with London's other underground railways aside from the small <a href="Waterloo%20%26amp%3B%20City%20Railway">Waterloo & City Railway</a>, was taken into public ownership as part of the newly formed <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Passenger Transport Board</a> (LPTB). As a consequence, despite it being from the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>, Westcott station became part of the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> network. The Brill Tramway was by this time losing significant sums of money. Goods traffic had dwindled, and unlike other areas served by the former Metropolitan Railway, passenger numbers were low; in 1932 Westcott station saw only 1,560 passengers and collected only £27 (about £ in 2019) in passenger receipts.

<a href="Frank%20Pick">Frank Pick</a>, Managing Director of the <a href="Underground%20Electric%20Railways%20Company%20of%20London">Underground Group</a> from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, saw the lines beyond Aylesbury to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes, concluding that over £2000 (about £ in 2019) would be saved simply by closing the Brill Tramway. As a consequence, the LPTB decided to abandon all passenger services beyond Aylesbury. The Brill Tramway was closed on 1 December 1935, with the last trains running on 30 November.

Upon the withdrawal of London Transport services the lease expired and the railway and stations reverted to the control of the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company. With no funds and no rolling stock of its own the O&ATC was unable to operate the line, and on 2 April 1936 the entire infrastructure of the line was sold at auction. The cheapest of the 53 lots sold were the Westcott station sign and the oil lamps from the Westcott level crossing, both of which sold for one <a href="shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">shilling</a>. The railway house at Westcott was also sold, fetching £305 (about £ in 2019).

Metropolitan line trains ceased to run north of Aylesbury from 6 July 1936. <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a> services (<a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a> from 1948) continued to run from London's <a href="Marylebone%20station">Marylebone station</a> over the line to Verney Junction via Quainton Road until March 1963. No trace of the line at Westcott remains, but the station building remains in place in the <a href="back%20garden">back garden</a> of the former station house, now a private residence, and carries an exact replica of its original "Westcott" station sign. Aside from the <a href="junction%20station">junction station</a> at Quainton Road, now preserved as the <a href="Buckinghamshire%20Railway%20Centre">Buckinghamshire Railway Centre</a>, the two buildings at Westcott are the only significant buildings associated with the Brill Tramway to have survived.

Brian Eaton

<a href="Air%20Vice%20Marshal">Air Vice Marshal</a> Brian Alexander Eaton, (15 December 1916 – 17 October 1992) was a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). Born in <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and raised in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, he joined the RAAF in 1936 and was promoted to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> on the outbreak of World War II. He held training positions before being posted to <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a> at the beginning of 1943, flying <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20variants">P-40 Kittyhawk</a> fighter-bombers in <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North Africa</a>. Despite being shot down three times within ten days soon after arriving, Eaton quickly rose to become the unit's commanding officer, and by year's end had been awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a>. His leadership earned him the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> and <a href="Medal%20bar">Bar</a> in 1944–45, and command of <a href="List%20of%20Royal%20Air%20Force%20wings">No. 239 Wing RAF</a> in <a href="Italian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Italy</a>, with the temporary rank of <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a>. He was also awarded the US <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a> in 1946 in recognition of his war service.

In the decade following World War II, Eaton led <a href="No.%2081%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 81 Wing</a> in Japan, and <a href="No.%2078%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 78 Wing</a> in <a href="Malta">Malta</a>. He commanded <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Williamtown">RAAF Base Williamtown</a> from 1957 to 1959, after which he was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a>. As Director-General of Operational Requirements in 1965, Eaton argued for increased RAAF co-operation with the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> in light of growing involvement in the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20the%20Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. He was promoted to air vice marshal the next year, and became <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a>. Posted to <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> as <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) <a href="List%20of%20Royal%20Air%20Force%20groups">No. 224 Group RAF</a> in 1967, he was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> for his work as chief of staff at Headquarters <a href="Far%20East%20Air%20Force%20%28Royal%20Air%20Force%29">RAF Far East Air Force</a> in 1969. He then served as <a href="Air%20Member%20for%20Personnel%20%28Australia%29">Air Member for Personnel</a>, before being selected as AOC <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Operational Command</a> in 1973. Eaton retired from the RAAF in December that year, and became an executive for <a href="Rolls-Royce%20plc">Rolls-Royce</a> in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>. He died in 1992 at the age of 75.

Brian Eaton was born in <a href="Launceston%2C%20Tasmania">Launceston</a>, Tasmania, on 15 December 1916, to Sydney and Hilda Eaton. The family later moved to <a href="Canterbury%2C%20Victoria">Canterbury</a>, Victoria, and Brian was educated at <a href="Carey%20Baptist%20Grammar%20School">Carey Grammar</a>. His early ambition to be a doctor was curtailed when his father died and he had to leave school early. He enlisted as an air cadet in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) on 20 January 1936, undergoing flying training at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">RAAF Station Point Cook</a>.

Eaton was commissioned as a <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> upon graduation from flying school in January 1937, and posted to <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron</a>. Within six months he was promoted to <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> and joined <a href="No.%2021%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 21 Squadron</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Station Laverton</a>. In 1938, he became an <a href="flight%20instructor">instructor</a> at Point Cook's <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Flying Training School</a>, where he also took part in the RAAF's early long navigation exercises. He was promoted to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> on <a href="Invasion%20of%20Poland">1 September 1939</a>.

In April 1940, Eaton was assigned to the newly re-formed <a href="Central%20Flying%20School%20RAAF">Central Flying School</a> at <a href="Camden%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Camden</a>, New South Wales, as an instructor. Promoted to temporary <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> in September 1940, he was transferred to the Directorate of Training in June 1941. He became a fighter controller at <a href="No.%205%20Fighter%20Sector%20RAAF">No. 5 Fighter Sector Headquarters</a>, <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Northern Territory, in March 1942. In October that year, he departed Australia for <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North Africa</a> via India and the United Kingdom, fearful that the fighting would be over before he arrived. He posted in to No. 1 Middle East Training School in January 1943 prior to taking up duties with <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B3%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron RAAF</a>, which was then engaged in the <a href="Tunisia%20Campaign">Battle of Tunisia</a>.

Eaton's combat career began inauspiciously, when he was shot down three times in the space of ten days. On the first occasion, his <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20variants">P-40 Kittyhawk</a> was hit by <a href="20%20mm%20caliber">20 mm</a> cannon shells from an enemy fighter that he never saw. He later recalled, "I was too busy getting the kite down to be frightened. But my God was I surprised." Eaton brought his crippled aircraft in for a forced landing at <a href="El%20Hamma">El Hamma</a>—in the midst of a tank battle between German and New Zealand forces. After the fighting had died down he made his way over to the New Zealanders, who gave him a lift back to his air base. The second time he was shot down, his plane was struck by <a href="8.8%20cm%20Flak%2018/36/37/41">88 mm</a> anti-aircraft fire, necessitating another crash landing, this time behind enemy lines. Sympathetic Arab tribesmen smuggled him past the Germans and back to his airfield. Two days later, his P-40 was hit by fire from an <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20109">Me 109</a> that dived at him from out of the sun. He was able to glide back to base, away, but on arriving found that it was under attack by German bombers. He decided he had no other option than to land the damaged plane among the exploding bombs, and managed to do so without mishap. His series of narrow escapes engendered a spirit of fatalism, and a habit of keeping his emotions severely in check while on duty: "I just couldn't see myself living when so many were dying. It was something which, at the time, didn't bear much dwelling on."

Despite his early setbacks in combat, Eaton soon rose to command No. 3 Squadron, taking over from Squadron Leader <a href="Bobby%20Gibbes">Bobby Gibbes</a> on 21 April 1943. He led the unit as it relocated to <a href="Malta">Malta</a> the following month, in preparation for the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a>. Illness forced him to hand over command in June–July, but he returned to take charge of the squadron in August as it continued to fly escort and <a href="interdiction">interdiction</a> missions in Sicily with other units of <a href="List%20of%20Royal%20Air%20Force%20wings">No. 239 Wing RAF</a>. His brother Roger, a <a href="flight%20sergeant">flight sergeant</a> serving with the RAF, was killed in a <a href="Vickers%20Wellington">Wellington</a> bomber raid during the campaign. On 3 September, No. 3 Squadron took part in the opening day of the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Italy">Allied invasion of Italy</a>, supporting the British <a href="XIII%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XIII Corps</a> as it moved inland after landing at <a href="Calabria">Calabria</a>. Enemy air resistance remained light and worthwhile ground targets few as the campaign progressed but, on 24 October, Eaton led an attack against German shipping off the <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslav</a> coast that left a merchant ship and two barges on fire. He repeated the exercise on 7 November, when the squadron scored hits on vessels in two separate raids in the harbour at <a href="Split%20%28city%29">Split</a>. On 19 November, when the rest of No. 239 Wing was unable to complete any missions due to adverse weather, Eaton found a hole in the clouds and led eight Kittyhawks in a successful attack on <a href="Opi%20%28town%29">Opi</a> in central Italy. He was promoted to temporary <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> on 1 December. On 14 December, he was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> for pressing home a night attack on <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> armour at <a href="Termoli">Termoli</a>. The citation was promulgated in the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>":
On 16 February 1944, the day after the contentious destruction of <a href="Monte%20Cassino">Monte Cassino</a>, Eaton took No. 3 Squadron through a break in the bad weather to attack the ruined monastery, the only one of No. 239 Wing's units to successfully bomb its target that day. He handed over command of No. 3 Squadron later that month, and was transferred to No. 1 Mobile Operations Room Unit as forward air controller for the final <a href="Battle%20of%20Monte%20Cassino">assault on Monte Cassino</a>. The run of luck that Eaton experienced in his first weeks of air combat in Tunisia continued on the ground in Italy. He survived three months of constant artillery fire, including an occasion when a shell exploded directly above his observation post, striking down a British officer standing next to him. He also came under machine-gun fire when he took a wrong turn one day and drove into the German lines, but again escaped unhurt. He was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> on 7 April, in recognition of his leadership of No. 3 Squadron in North Africa, Malta, Sicily and Italy.
Raised to acting <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a>, Eaton was given command of No. 239 Wing on 3 August 1944, taking responsibility for No. 3 Squadron and <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B450%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 450 Squadron RAAF</a>, <a href="No.%20112%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 112 Squadron</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Royal%20Air%20Force%20aircraft%20squadrons">No. 260 Squadron RAF</a>, No. 5 Squadron of the <a href="South%20African%20Air%20Force">South African Air Force</a>, and No. 250 Squadron of the <a href="Royal%20Rhodesian%20Air%20Force">Royal Rhodesian Air Force</a>. Credited with leading "many outstanding raids", he was known to his staff as "The Boss", and often flew twice a day with a different squadron on each mission; when his superiors found out how many sorties he was personally undertaking and ordered him to cut back, he simply ceased recording his flying hours. The wing's two RAF squadrons had already re-equipped with <a href="P-51%20Mustang">P-51 Mustang</a>s when Eaton took over; No. 5 converted in September and No. 3 in November. As well as supporting the <a href="Eighth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Eighth Army</a> in Italy, the Mustang units carried out missions in Yugoslavia in concert with the <a href="Balkan%20Air%20Force">Balkan Air Force</a>, prior to Axis forces surrendering on 2 May.

Eaton was unofficially credited with shooting down as many as seven enemy aircraft during the Mediterranean campaigns, but was never listed among Australian <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a>s. Many of the missions that he undertook with No. 3 Squadron and in command of No. 239 Wing were ground attack or anti-shipping sorties, rather than air-to-air combat. He was also known as a leader who, when opportunities did arise to engage other aircraft, would attempt to manoeuvre his rookie pilots into position to make a "kill", rather than take the shot himself. On 12 June, he was awarded a <a href="Medal%20bar">Bar</a> to his Distinguished Service Order for "Outstanding skill and leadership against heavy odds". His war service also earned him the US <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a>, permission to wear it being <a href="London%20Gazette">gazetted</a> on 14 June 1946.

Eaton was posted to Britain following the end of World War II, and attended <a href="RAF%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">RAF Staff College</a> the next year. In September 1947, he was appointed Officer Commanding <a href="No.%2081%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 81 (Fighter) Wing</a> in Japan, as part of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a> (BCOF). The Australian contingent initially comprised three combat units, <a href="No.%2076%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 76</a>, <a href="No.%2077%20Squadron%20RAAF">77</a> and <a href="No.%2082%20Squadron%20RAAF">82 Squadrons</a>, as well as No. 381 (Base) Squadron, No. 481 (Maintenance) Squadron, No. 111 Mobile Fighter Control Unit, and <a href="No.%205%20Airfield%20Construction%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron</a>. By mid-1949, it had been reduced to No. 77 Squadron alone, and Headquarters BCOF had been disbanded; Eaton served as "RAAF Component" commander for the remainder of his tenure in Japan. As well as surveillance patrols, training and inter-service exercises, the Australian airmen took part in ceremonial flypasts. On one such occasion, over Tokyo, Eaton led his formation of thirty Mustangs into cloud with a faulty <a href="artificial%20horizon">artificial horizon</a> in his plane, with the result that he and his comrades, who were following his lead, became badly disorientated and were fortunate to avoid collision; RAAF historian Alan Stephens considered this a not-atypical example of the casual attitude to flying safety exhibited at the time by the veteran pilots of World War II.

Returning to Australia in November 1949, Eaton became Deputy Director of Training at the Department of Air, <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>, where he remained until 1951. Later that year, he was appointed Officer Commanding <a href="No.%2078%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 78 (Fighter) Wing</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Williamtown">RAAF Base Williamtown</a>, New South Wales. He had reverted to a substantive rank of wing commander since leaving Japan, as the RAAF shrank dramatically with demobilisation and many senior officers lost the temporary or acting ranks they had gained in wartime. On 15 September, he landed a <a href="De%20Havilland%20Vampire">Vampire</a> jet fighter at Point Cook with one flat tyre and one wheel retracted, after its undercarriage had become jammed. The plane skidded off the runway but Eaton was able to walk away, reportedly remarking "Well, I didn't wreck it". He married Josephine Rumbles at <a href="Toorak%2C%20Victoria">Toorak</a> Presbyterian Church in Melbourne on 10 May 1952; the couple later had a son and two daughters. Following Britain's request to the Australian government for a Commonwealth garrison in the Mediterranean, in July 1952 Eaton led No. 78 Wing on deployment to <a href="RAF%20Hal%20Far">RAF Hal Far</a> near <a href="Valletta">Valletta</a>, Malta, where its combat squadrons, <a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 75</a> and 76, were equipped with leased Vampire FB9s. As the overseas posting was for a minimum of two years, his new bride and the families of other staff were permitted to make the journey as well. The Australian airmen participated in many <a href="NATO">NATO</a> exercises while stationed at Malta, and one year took first and second place in the Middle Eastern Gunnery Contest for the <a href="Ernest%20Mason">"Imshi" Mason Cup</a>. Promoted to the substantive rank of group captain on 1 January 1953, Eaton was granted command of <a href="Ta%27%20Qali">RAF Ta'Kali</a> when the wing transferred there from Hal Far in June.
Completing his tour with No. 78 Wing in mid-1954, Eaton joined Air Vice Marshal <a href="Alister%20Murdoch">Alister Murdoch</a> on an international mission to examine potential new fighter, bomber, transport and training aircraft for the RAAF. The team's report advocated the <a href="Lockheed%20F-104%20Starfighter">F-104 Starfighter</a> as a replacement for the <a href="CAC%20Sabre">CAC Sabre</a>, as well as <a href="Nuclear%20warfare">nuclear-capable</a> British <a href="V%20bomber">V-bomber</a> strike aircraft to augment Australia's <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">Canberra</a> bombers, and <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules">C-130 Hercules</a> transports to replace the <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">C-47 Dakota</a>. While the proposals for V-bombers and the F-104 were not taken up, the Australian Government acquired the C-130 in 1958. Described as second only to the <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111C">General Dynamics F-111C</a> as the "most significant" purchase by the RAAF, the Hercules gave the Air Force its first <a href="Airlift%23Strategic%20airlift">strategic airlift</a> capability, which in years to come would provide a "lifeline" to Australian forces deployed to <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malaya</a>, <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam</a>, and other parts of the South-West Pacific. The mission also recommended the locally built Vampire T35 as a jet trainer for No. 1 Applied Flying Training School; sixty-nine were later delivered by the <a href="de%20Havilland">de Havilland</a> factory in <a href="Bankstown%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bankstown</a>, New South Wales. Eaton served as RAAF Director of Operations during 1955–56, and as Officer Commanding RAAF Base Williamtown and Commandant of the co-located School of Land-Air Warfare from March 1957 until February 1959. He was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in the 1959 <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">Queen's Birthday Honours</a>.

Following his tour at Williamtown, Eaton spent two years as Director of Joint Services Plans before attending the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College, London</a> in 1961. Raised to <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a>, he was appointed Director-General Operational Requirements in 1962. Concurrently he became an Honorary <a href="Aide-de-Camp">Aide-de-Camp</a> to <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>, in which capacity he served until 1965. As the Army reorganised to deal with <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20the%20Vietnam%20War">Australia's increasing commitments to the Vietnam War</a> in the mid-1960s, it sought to procure a dozen twin-engined aircraft of a size hitherto only operated by the RAAF, and also proposed a joint review of <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a>. RAAF senior command chose to deal with the Army's proposals by ignoring them. As Director-General of Operational Requirements, Eaton argued that if the RAAF did not more fully satisfy the ground support requirements of the Army, then the Army itself would seek to take control of this sphere of operations, undermining the RAAF's position as the main provider of Australia's air power. Pointing out to the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Marshal Murdoch, that it was "clearly the Army's intention to have complete command and control" of air-to-ground assets, he warned of a parallel situation in America, where the <a href="United%20States%20Army">US Army</a> was looking to take over all battlefield air support in response to the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">USAF</a> failing to keep up to date in the provision of basic attack aircraft. The RAAF's refusal to adequately deal with its ground support responsibilities led to long-running inter-service enmity, and contributed to the Australian government's decision twenty years later to transfer control of battlefield helicopters to the Army. At this time, Eaton also led the acquisition team that selected the <a href="Aermacchi%20MB-326">Macchi MB-326</a> as the RAAF's new jet trainer, as it met all requirements, could be licence-built in Australia, and was relatively inexpensive. The first of ninety-seven was delivered by the <a href="Commonwealth%20Aircraft%20Corporation">Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation</a> in 1967.

Promoted to <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a>, Eaton became <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a> in 1966. In December that year, with Australian <a href="de%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-4%20Caribou">Caribou</a> transports and <a href="Bell%20UH-1%20Iroquois">Iroquois</a> helicopters already serving in Vietnam, Eaton advocated building up the RAAF's "sharp end" there, increasing air support for ground troops. He preferred deploying Sabre or <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%20III">Mirage</a> fighters rather than the mooted Canberra bombers, which he saw as more suitable for a strategic role. Above all, he accepted the "<a href="domino%20theory">domino theory</a>" and believed that if Australia did not aid South Vietnam, "we'd lose the lot". In the event, Canberras were despatched rather than fighters. In 1967, Eaton became the last AOC of <a href="List%20of%20Royal%20Air%20Force%20groups">No. 224 Group RAF</a> under the British Far East Air Force (FEAF) in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, as permanent squadrons were dropped from its strength. This reorganisation led to him taking over as chief of staff at Headquarters FEAF the following year. In this capacity, he was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> (CB) in the 1969 Queen's Birthday Honours.

Returning to Australia, Eaton became Air Member for Personnel (AMP) in October 1969. As AMP, he sat on the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Air Board</a>, the RAAF's controlling body, consisting of its most senior officers and chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. In January 1973, he was appointed AOC Operational Command (now <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Air Command</a>). He served in this position until retirement, his tenure witnessing the introduction of the F-111C <a href="Variable-sweep%20wing">swing-wing</a> bomber to service in Australia, when the first machines touched down at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Base Amberley</a>, Queensland, in July.

USS Constellation vs L'Insurgente

USS "Constellation" vs "L'Insurgente", or the Action of 9 February 1799, was a <a href="single-ship%20action">single-ship action</a> fought between <a href="frigate">frigate</a>s of the <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> during the <a href="Quasi-War">Quasi-War</a>, an <a href="undeclared%20war">undeclared war</a> that lasted from 1798 to 1800. The battle resulted in capture of <a href="French%20frigate%20Insurgente%20%281793%29">"L'Insurgente"</a>, after an intense firefight in which both sides exchanged heavy <a href="Broadsides">broadsides</a> and <a href="Musket">musket</a> fire.

French <a href="privateer">privateer</a>ing attacks against American vessels, begun a year prior, caused the conflict between the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and <a href="French%20First%20Republic">France</a>. An American <a href="squadron%20%28naval%29">squadron</a> under Commodore <a href="Thomas%20Truxtun">Thomas Truxtun</a> had been sent to patrol the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> waters between <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and <a href="Saint%20Kitts">Saint Kitts</a> with orders to engage any French forces they found in the area. While Truxtun was sailing independently of his squadron in "Constellation", his <a href="flagship">flagship</a>, he met and engaged "L'Insurgente". After chasing the French ship through a storm, "Constellation" forced "L'Insurgente" into an engagement that lasted an hour and fourteen minutes before the French frigate surrendered. The French sustained heavy casualties in the action, while the numbers of American dead and wounded were low.

After the action, "L'Insurgente" was taken to Saint Kitts and commissioned into the United States Navy as . With this and later victories, American morale soared, and Truxtun returned home to honor and praise from the American government and the public at large.

In 1798, an <a href="undeclared%20war">undeclared war</a> between the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and <a href="French%20First%20Republic">France</a> began due to French <a href="privateer">privateer</a>ing attacks against American vessels. These attacks were sanctioned due to the failure of the United States to repay its considerable <a href="France%20in%20the%20American%20Revolutionary%20War">debts to France</a>, incurred during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American War of Independence</a>. In response to the attacks, the United States government decided to go on the offensive by sending four naval <a href="squadron%20%28naval%29">squadron</a>s to the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> with orders to seize armed French vessels and prevent privateers from attacking American ships. One of the squadrons, under the command of Commodore <a href="Thomas%20Truxtun">Thomas Truxtun</a>, was dispatched to cruise between <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and <a href="Saint%20Kitts">Saint Kitts</a>. Truxtun's squadron consisted of his <a href="flagship">flagship</a>, the <a href="frigate">frigate</a> , the 20-gun , the <a href="brig%20%28ship%29">brigs</a> and , and the <a href="revenue%20cutter">revenue cutter</a> . Opposing Truxtun were several French vessels based in <a href="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a>, among them a number of privateers as well as two <a href="French%20Navy">French naval</a> frigates and a smaller, 20-gun <a href="corvette">corvette</a>. One of the French frigates, <a href="USS%20Insurgent%20%281799%29">"L'Insurgente"</a>, <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d from Guadeloupe on 8 February, commanded by Michel-Pierre Barreaut.

Though the 1,265-ton "Constellation" was officially classified by the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> as a 36-gun frigate, during the Quasi-War she carried a heavier armament of 38 guns. Consisting of twenty-eight <a href="24-pounder%20long%20gun">24-pounders</a> on her <a href="main%20deck">main deck</a> and ten <a href="12-pounder%20long%20gun">12-pounders</a> on her <a href="spar%20deck">spar deck</a>, "Constellation" main armament had a combined <a href="throw-weight">throwing weight</a> of . In contrast, "L'Insurgente", rated a 32-gun , was armed with 40 cannons. The armament of Barreaut's 950-ton ship consisted of twenty-four 12-pounders, two <a href="18-pounder%20long%20gun">18-pounders</a>, eight 6-pounders, four 32-pounder <a href="carronade">carronade</a>s, and two 24-pounder carronades, totalling a combined throwing weight of only . Thus, although Barreaut's vessel carried two more guns in total, Truxtun's frigate had a more powerful armament due to shot weight. In a <a href="boarding%20action">boarding action</a>, the French frigate's crew of 409 men would have had an advantage over the American ship's 309, but in a gunnery duel the Americans were superior.

At noon on 9 February, while cruising independently, Truxtun's men sighted a frigate off the coast of <a href="Nevis">Nevis</a>. Upon approach it was evident that the vessel was flying American colors, and "Constellation" attempted to move closer to investigate. Unknown to Truxtun, the frigate was the French "L'Insurgente" under Michel-Pierre Barreaut. Nearing the still-unidentified "L'Insurgente", Truxtun attempted to signal her to discern her nationality by displaying first British signals and then American signals. Unable to send the correct reply, "L'Insurgente" replaced the American colors with French and fired a gun. Upon sighting "Constellation" at 12:30 pm, Barreaut mistook the ship for a British <a href="corvette">corvette</a> and began to flee toward the Dutch islands of <a href="Saba">Saba</a> and <a href="Sint%20Eustatius">Sint Eustatius</a> to evade his assailant. Truxtun gave chase, but was hampered at 1:30 p.m. when the two vessels ran into a <a href="gale">gale</a>. As a result of the storm, "L'Insurgente" lost her main <a href="topmast">topmast</a> and was severely damaged, while "Constellation" managed to avoid significant damage and was able to close in on Barreaut.

Though Truxtun's ship initially held an advantageous position in the wind known as the <a href="weather%20gauge">weather gauge</a>, she was over-armed, and as a result her <a href="leeward">leeward</a> side <a href="heeling%20%28sailing%29">heeled</a> so much that the gunports on that side of the vessel could not be opened. Truxtun decided to cede the weather gauge to the French by sailing around "L'Insurgente"s leeward side and bringing "Constellation" near the French frigate's <a href="port%20and%20starboard">port side</a>. In such a position "Constellation" was disadvantaged by the wind, but was able to avoid some of the heeling effect on her guns. With "Constellation" approaching his frigate fast, Barreaut tried to communicate with the Americans in order to avoid a fight. The American frigate ignored the French attempt at hailing her and closed to within fifty yards of "L'Insurgente" before opening up on her with a <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. The <a href="double-shotted">double-shotted</a> American salvo severely damaged the French frigate's <a href="quarterdeck">quarterdeck</a>. Barreaut's vessel replied with her own broadsides that damaged "Constellation's" fore topmast. Midshipman <a href="David%20Porter%20%28naval%20officer%29">David Porter</a>, stationed in the rigging of "Constellations" damaged mast, managed to relieve pressure from it and prevented its collapse. "L'Insurgente" attempted to close on the American frigate to <a href="boarding%20%28attack%29">board</a> her. With less damage to her <a href="rigging">rigging</a>, "Constellation" was easily able to avoid Barreaut's attempts at boarding.

"Constellation" crossed "L'Insurgente"s bow and <a href="raking%20fire">raked</a> her with a broadside. Truxtun then maneuvered "Constellation" to "L'Insurgente"s starboard side and fired further broadsides into the French frigate, but received damage to her rigging in return. "Constellation" slipped ahead of "L'Insurgente", again crossing her bow and raking her. Once more "Constellation" slipped next to "L'Insurgente"s leeward side and fired into her, disabling the French vessel's 18-pounder guns. "Constellation" crossed the frigate's bow a third time, but the French ship had by then sustained massive damage. Attempts by Barreaut's crew to repair "L'Insurgente"s rigging were fruitless and the French captain <a href="striking%20the%20colors">struck his colors</a> to surrender the vessel. The engagement had lasted 74 minutes.

The end of the action signaled the first victory over an enemy warship for the newly formed United States Navy. After Barreaut had struck his colors, Truxtun sent a boat over to board, identify, and take possession of the French vessel. It was only upon boarding "L'Insurgente" that the Americans learned the identity of their opponents. The storm and the battle had caused immense damage to the French frigate. In comparison, "Constellation" had suffered moderate damage to her rigging, but was otherwise still intact. French casualties included 29 killed and 41 wounded, while the Americans suffered two dead and two wounded. One American died shortly after the action ended, of wounds received from French fire; another was executed for cowardice by "Constellation"s Lieutenant <a href="Andrew%20Sterett">Andrew Sterett</a> after the man deserted his gun at the start of the action.

"Constellation" began taking on <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> from "L'Insurgente", but by nightfall the two ships had become separated in a storm. Left aboard "L'Insurgente" were "Constellation"s First Lieutenant <a href="John%20Rodgers%20%28naval%20officer%2C%20War%20of%201812%29">John Rodgers</a>, Midshipman <a href="David%20Porter%20%28naval%20officer%29">David Porter</a>, and 11 enlisted men, along with 170 French prisoners. The Americans were forced to sail the vessel short-handed while guarding the French prisoners. As the prisoners outnumbered their captors and no gear to secure them could be found aboard, the Frenchmen were driven into "L'Insurgente"s lower holds. Finally, after three nights, "L'Insurgente" was brought in to Saint Kitts where "Constellation" was waiting for her. While at the American naval depot at Saint Kitts, "Constellation"s troublesome 24-pounder guns were removed and replaced with 18-pounder cannons. At the American <a href="prize%20court">prize court</a> in <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>, "L'Insurgente" was condemned to be sold as a <a href="prize%20%28law%29">war prize</a>, with the proceeds distributed to the crew of "Constellation". <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="Benjamin%20Stoddert">Benjamin Stoddert</a> managed to negotiate the prize award down from $120,000 to $84,000 before purchasing "L'Insurgente" and commissioning her in the United States Navy as USS "Insurgent".

For his victory over "L'Insurgente", Truxtun received honors both at home and abroad. When accounts of the action reached London, Truxtun was <a href="f%C3%AAte">fête</a>d by the merchants there who sent him a piece of silver plate to commemorate his victory. In the United States, morale soared upon hearing of the first American victory over the French. Truxtun was cited by Stoddert for his excellent conduct during the action, and songs and poems such as "Brave Yankee Boys" were later written about the event. In contrast, when Barreaut returned to France he was accused of failing to put up sufficient resistance in the engagement and was given a <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>. Despite the accusations, he had been praised by Truxtun after the action for his bravery and was acquitted during the court-martial. The French were infuriated upon hearing the results of the action because the two countries were not officially at war; Governor <a href="Edme%20%C3%89tienne%20Borne%20Desfourneaux">Edme Étienne Borne Desfourneaux</a> of <a href="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a> demanded that "Insurgent" be returned to French control. Upon learning of the American refusal to repatriate "Insurgent", Desfourneaux was outraged and ordered all American vessels and property to be seized, while also declaring that a state of war existed between the United States and Guadeloupe. After continuing their cruise for a few weeks, both "Insurgent" and "Constellation" were forced to return to Norfolk by the end of March due to the expiration of the terms of enlistment of their crews. On her next cruise "Constellation" <a href="USS%20Constellation%20vs%20La%20Vengeance">prevailed in another action</a> against <a href="HMS%20Vengeance%20%281800%29">"La Vengeance"</a>, although her own casualties were heavy this time, and that French frigate escaped "L'Insurgente"s fate.

Lemurs of Madagascar (book)

Lemurs of Madagascar is a 2010 <a href="reference%20work">reference work</a> and <a href="field%20guide">field guide</a> for the <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, giving descriptions and biogeographic data for the known species. The primary contributor is <a href="Russell%20Mittermeier">Russell Mittermeier</a>, president of <a href="Conservation%20International">Conservation International</a>, and the cover art and illustrations were drawn by <a href="Stephen%20D.%20Nash%20%28illustrator%29">Stephen D. Nash</a>. Currently in its third edition, the book provides details about all known lemur species, general information about lemurs and their history, and also helps travelers identify species they may encounter. Four related pocket field guides have also been released, containing color illustrations of each species, miniature range maps, and species checklists.

The first edition was reviewed favorably in the "<a href="International%20Journal%20of%20Primatology">International Journal of Primatology</a>", "<a href="Conservation%20Biology%20%28journal%29">Conservation Biology</a>", and "<a href="Lemur%20News">Lemur News</a>". Reviewers, including <a href="Alison%20Jolly">Alison Jolly</a>, praised the book for its meticulous coverage of each species, numerous high-quality illustrations, and engaging discussion of lemur topics, including conservation, evolution, and the recently extinct <a href="subfossil%20lemur">subfossil lemur</a>s. Each agreed that the book was an excellent resource for a wide audience, including <a href="ecotourism">ecotourists</a> and lemur researchers. A lengthy review of the second edition was published in the "<a href="American%20Journal%20of%20Primatology">American Journal of Primatology</a>", where it received similar favorable comments, plus praise for its updates and enhancements. The third edition was reviewed favorably in "Lemur News"; the reviewer praised the expanded content of the book, but was concerned that the edition was not as portable as its predecessors.

The first edition identified 50 lemur species and subspecies, compared to 71 in the second edition and 101 in the third. The <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> promoted by these books has been questioned by researchers, such as <a href="Ian%20Tattersall">Ian Tattersall</a>, who view these growing numbers of <a href="List%20of%20lemur%20species">lemur species</a> as insufficiently justified inflation of species numbers (<a href="taxonomic%20inflation">taxonomic inflation</a>).

"Lemurs of Madagascar" is published by Conservation International (CI), a non-profit conservation organization headquartered near Washington, D.C., and is intended as a field guide that identifies all of the known lemur species from Madagascar. The first edition of "Lemurs of Madagascar" was published in 1994 and contained 356 pages. The 520-page second edition was published in 2006 and is now officially out of print, having been followed by the 767-page third edition in the fall of 2010.

For all three editions, Stephen D. Nash, winner of the 2004 <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Primatologists">American Society of Primatologists</a> President's Award, has been the illustrator and front cover artist. The lead author for all three editions is Russell A. Mittermeier, president of CI and a well-published <a href="primatology">primatologist</a>, <a href="herpetology">herpetologist</a> and <a href="biological%20anthropology">biological anthropologist</a>. In the first edition, four other authors were also listed: Ian Tattersall, a curator in the Division of Anthropology at the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>; William R. Konstant, the Director of Conservation and Science at the <a href="Houston%20Zoo">Houston Zoo</a>; David M. Meyers, a researcher and conservationist who has worked with CI, the <a href="World%20Wildlife%20Fund">World Wildlife Fund</a>, and other conservation and development organizations; and Roderic B. Mast, <a href="marine%20biology">marine biologist</a>, primatologist, and the founding Director of CI's Madagascar Program.

The second edition was authored by Mittermeier, Konstant, Tattersall, and Meyers, as well as seven new authors: Frank Hawkins, the Technical Director for CI in Madagascar; <a href="Edward%20E.%20Louis%2C%20Jr.">Edward E. Louis, Jr.</a>, the conservation geneticist for Omaha's <a href="Henry%20Doorly%20Zoo">Henry Doorly Zoo</a>'s Center for Conservation and Research; Olivier Langrand, CI's Senior Vice President for Africa and Madagascar; Jonah H. Ratsimbazafy, the Scientific Coordinator for the <a href="Durrell%20Wildlife%20Conservation%20Trust">Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust</a> - Madagascar Program; Rodin Rasoloarison, a field researcher and research coordinator at the <a href="German%20Primate%20Center">German Primate Center</a>; Jörg U. Ganzhorn, professor in the Department of Animal Ecology and Conservation at the <a href="University%20of%20Hamburg">University of Hamburg</a> and Chairman for the Madagascar section of the <a href="IUCN%20Species%20Survival%20Commission">IUCN Species Survival Commission</a> (IUCN/SSC) <a href="IUCN%20Species%20Survival%20Commission%23Primate%20Specialist%20Group">Primate Specialist Group</a> since 1998; and Serge Rajaobelina, the President of Fanamby, a Malagasy <a href="Non-governmental%20organization">non-governmental environmental organization</a>.

The list of authors changed again with the third edition. Returning authors included Mittermeier, Louis, Langrand, Hawkins, Rajaobelina, Ratsimbazafy, and Rasoloarison. New authors included Matthew Richardson, writer and member of the IUCN/SSC Primate Specialist Group; Christoph Schwitzer, the Head of Research at the Bristol Zoo Gardens; Anthony Rylands, a Senior Research Scientist at Conservation International and Deputy Chair of the IUCN/SSC Primate Specialist Group; Christian Roos, a geneticist at the German Primate Center; Peter M. Kappeler, a Professor of Sociobiology and Anthropology at the <a href="University%20of%20G%C3%B6ttingen">University of Göttingen</a> in Germany; and James MacKinnon, the Senior Technical Director of Conservation International in Madagascar.

The first edition followed a 1982 volume by Tattersall, entitled "Primates of Madagascar". As a field guide, the "Lemurs of Madagascar" is "more portable and affordable," while offering updated information to assist lemur researchers and tourists in the identification of lemur species and subspecies, according to a 1996 review published in "Lemur News". All three editions cover the <a href="natural%20history">natural history</a> and <a href="conservation%20status">conservation status</a> for each known species. They also discuss <a href="Lemur%23Conservation">conservation strategies</a>, <a href="Evolutionary%20history%20of%20lemurs">lemur origins</a>, <a href="Subfossil%20lemur">extinct lemurs</a>, and the <a href="Lemur%23Research">history of discoveries</a> made by early European naturalists. The books provide suggestions on where to see each species, as well as checklists to help people keep track of their sightings. The purpose of the book is defined in the "Introduction" as follows:

Four pocket field guides have also been published by CI, intended strictly to help people identify lemurs in the field by providing over 100 species illustrations. All illustrations, including the detailed cover art, were drawn by Nash. Checklists for their respective lemur species are included with these guides, along with <a href="thumbnail">thumbnail</a> range maps for each species. The four pocket guides include two editions of "Lemurs of Madagascar Pocket Identification Guide" (out of print), "Nocturnal Lemurs", and "Diurnal and Cathemeral Lemurs". The "Nocturnal Lemurs" booklet contains 65 species from eight <a href="genus">genera</a>. "Diurnal and Cathemeral Lemurs" hosts 34 species and subspecies from seven genera, along with illustrations to show male and female fur color differences in the genus "<a href="True%20lemur">Eulemur</a>" and <a href="Polymorphism%20%28biology%29">color morphs</a> for the <a href="indri">indri</a> and <a href="ruffed%20lemur">ruffed lemur</a> species. A fifth and sixth pocket field guides are planned following the publication of the third edition of the field guide.

All three editions are split into multiple chapters, sections, and appendices. In the second and third editions, the inside of the front and back covers include a quick visual reference, with color-coded illustrations for each lemur type and colored tabs to help locate their corresponding sections. A section entitled "How to Use this Field Guide" is included between the "Introduction" and the first chapter. In this section, the layout of the book is discussed in detail, including the quick visual reference, chapters, appendices, references, and lemur-watching checklist. The chapter "The Living Lemurs" is discussed in great detail, including each section heading used for all the lemur species.

The "Introduction" in the first two editions was written by Peter A. Seligmann, Chairman of the Board and CEO of CI, and Mittermeier. In the third edition, the "Introduction" was written only by Mittermeier. In it, they emphasize the richness of Madagascar's primate diversity, summarize the conservation efforts and opportunities for preserving that diversity, and highlight recent discoveries, while also acknowledging the need for additional research. The chapter entitled "Origins of Lemurs" ("Origin of the Lemurs" in the third edition) briefly summarizes the theories on how lemurs came to Madagascar and the difficulty in resolving the mystery. "Discovery and Study of the Living Lemurs" reviews the history of exploration, field research, and <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic nomenclature</a> of lemurs, starting from the 1625 description of a <a href="ring-tailed%20lemur">ring-tailed lemur</a> to contemporary research by Western and Malagasy scientists. "The Extinct Lemurs" discusses the recently extinct subfossil lemurs, including the <a href="monkey%20lemur">monkey lemur</a>s, <a href="sloth%20lemur">sloth lemur</a>s, and <a href="koala%20lemur">koala lemur</a>s. "Conservation of Lemurs" details the threats lemurs face, such as <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a> and hunting for <a href="bushmeat">bushmeat</a>, and conservation efforts aimed at their protection, from the <a href="In-situ%20conservation">in-situ</a> and <a href="Ex-situ%20conservation">ex-situ</a> programs of the <a href="Madagascar%20Fauna%20Group">Madagascar Fauna Group</a> to the promise by Madagascar's former president <a href="Marc%20Ravalomanana">Marc Ravalomanana</a> to triple the country's protected areas over five years, known as the <a href="Durban%20Vision">Durban Vision</a>. In the third edition, a new chapter was added, entitled "Madagascar's Ancient Geological History", written by Maarten de Wit from the <a href="University%20of%20Cape%20Town">University of Cape Town</a>. In it, three billion years of geological and biological history are explored in detail.

The majority of the book, including the chapter "The Living Lemurs" and separate sections on each taxonomic group of lemur, providing detailed accounts of all lemur species known up until the time of publication, from the tiny <a href="mouse%20lemur">mouse lemur</a>s to the large <a href="indri">indri</a> and <a href="diademed%20sifaka">diademed sifaka</a>. In the first and second editions, the chapter "The Living Lemurs" is broken first into sections on <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">families</a>, and then into species clumped together by <a href="genus">genus</a>. In the third edition, each family is assigned its own chapter number, separate from "The Living Lemurs" chapter, yet the order and layout are the same. In the second and third editions, all pages within each family section are assigned a colored tab to match those in the quick visual reference inside the covers. Each species subsection has a distribution map, an illustration or photo (if available), a list of common names in multiple languages (including <a href="Malagasy%20language">Malagasy</a>), and species information broken into five sections: "Identification", "Geographic Range", "Natural History", "Conservation Status", and "Where to See It".
The "Identification" section for each species provides descriptive information to help identify and distinguish species, including a detailed physical description, discussions of variation in size and coloration (<a href="morphometrics">morphometrics</a>), and descriptions of distinguishing vocalizations. "Geographic Range" offers textual information to accompany the provided distribution map, although the authors note that ranges change due to habitat destruction and that species may be found in new localities outside of their known range. "Natural History" summarizes what is known about the behavior and ecology of each species, such as the unusual feeding strategies of the <a href="aye-aye">aye-aye</a> or the nest-building behavior of the <a href="ruffed%20lemur">ruffed lemur</a>s. Estimated populations densities and distributions, <a href="Biological%20life%20cycle">life histories</a>, diet, social structure, and other details are provided when known. For many species, little information is given due to a lack of research, while others have been studied extensively allowing for more elaborate detail. "Conservation Status" lists the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</a> assessment and <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a>s in which a species can be found, while also discussing specific threats to each species, the effects of local "<a href="Fady%20%28taboo%29">fady</a>" (taboos), the future outlook for species survival, and its coverage within <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a>s. Lastly, "Where to See It" aims to promote ecotourism by helping travelers find the best lemur watching sites that can be reached quickly and with the least effort. Suggested modes of transportation are sometimes mentioned as well.

The appendices differ between editions. The first edition has two appendices. The first is entitled "Lemurs Present in Protected Areas" and discusses each region and domain of Madagascar while also providing basic information and lemur species content for each protected area. The second appendix, "Alternative Names for Towns and Sites in Madagascar" spells out a few alternative French and Malagasy names for some of the larger town and cities in Madagascar. In the second and third editions, Appendix A, "Maps of Madagascar", contains color maps that help locate towns, protected areas, topography, rivers, forest cover, regions, and lemur watching sites. Appendix B, entitled "Biogeographic Regions and Floristic Domains of Madagascar" discusses the regions and domains of Madagascar. Appendix C, "Key Sites for Watching Lemurs", covers characteristics and highlights of individual <a href="List%20of%20national%20parks%20of%20Madagascar">national parks</a>, reserves, and regions for lemur watching. The third edition added Appendix D, entitled "Primate-watching and Primate Life-listing". In it, "primate-watching" and "primate life-listing" (the act of recording personal first sightings of a species) are promoted while their benefits to conservation are discussed.

All three editions provide a "References" section, with the second edition listing approximately 500 scientific papers, books, reports, and dissertations used in the creation of the book. The number of references jumped to over 1,100 in the third edition. Following the "References", the first edition provides a section with the <a href="Color%20printing">color plates</a>. In contrast, the second and third editions provides color illustrations throughout the book.

In a 1996 review of the first edition in the "International Journal of Primatology", Lisa Gould spoke favorably of the book, citing passages about lemur descriptions from the 17th and 18th centuries that she found entertaining and informative. She was particularly fascinated with Chapter four, "The Extinct Lemurs", and the reconstructions by Nash that accompanied the descriptions of morphology, behavior, and diet. She praised Nash's artwork as being one of the most enjoyable aspects of the book. The book was hailed as an excellent source for identifying lemur species for both tourists and researchers. The book was also briefly reviewed in "<a href="College%20%26amp%3B%20Research%20Libraries%20News">College & Research Libraries News</a>" by George Eberhart in April 1996. The review noted Conservation International's promotion of <a href="ecotourism">ecotourism</a> while also providing a count of the book's illustrations: 35 color plates, 50 distribution maps, and 135 drawings of postures and behaviors.
In the 1996 edition (volume 2) of "Lemur News", <a href="Alison%20Jolly">Alison Jolly</a> praised the first edition for its "contribution to knowledge in general" and "its effect on its intended audience." Like Gould, Jolly praised the work as a field guide, as well as Nash's high-quality illustrations. She noted the attraction of Nash's subfossil lemur reconstruction, claiming that it was "rapidly becoming one of the most pirated single book illustration on the primate lecture-slide circuit." Jolly went on to praise the thoroughness of the natural history information provided for each species, including recently described species, noting that the information covered existing knowledge better than any other published literature, even when only a single paragraph was provided for poorly known species. The book was recommended not only for lemur specialists, but also for tourists, hoping it would spark an interest in ecotourism in impoverished Madagascar. The checklist of species, as well as the information on where to most easily spot them, earned a special mention from Jolly, who could only boast seeing 30 of the 50 known species at that time. Finally, the "most significant and most appreciative" audience Jolly mentioned was the Malagasy researchers, to whom Mittermeier reportedly gave 50 copies of the book during a workshop in 1995.

In a 1997 review from "Conservation Biology" by Joelisoa Ratsirarson, the book was referred to as a "remarkable achievement" for its up-to-date information, and for being the first comprehensive lemur field guide. Emphasizing many of the same highlights as Gould and Jolly, he went on to note the inclusion of captive management information, unpublished details, and the use of common names in English, French, German, and Malagasy. His critique focused on the organization of the illustrations in relation to the text, the lack of an index, and a desire for more information about the roles lemurs play in their <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>. Though he praised it for being useful to tourists, researchers, students, resource managers, and conservationists, he expressed concern over its lack of availability in the bookstores of Madagascar.

The completely revised second edition of "Lemurs of Madagascar" was reviewed in detail in the "American Journal of Primatology" by Stacey Tecot. Each chapter, section, and appendix was thoroughly summarized, and as with the reviews of previous editions, the chapter on subfossil lemurs was noted as one of the more "fascinating" parts of the book, particularly due to its colorful and informative illustrations. Although the book received only praise, Tecot did suggest two additions for the next edition: the need for information about the processes of <a href="island%20biogeography">island biogeography</a> and expansion on captive conservation programs aside from the <a href="Duke%20Lemur%20Center">Duke Lemur Center</a>, particularly at the <a href="Lemur%20Conservation%20Foundation">Lemur Conservation Foundation</a> and <a href="St.%20Catherines%20Island">St. Catherines Island</a>. A subject index was also recommended, along with better referencing of the figures and illustrations. Otherwise, the book was praised as being better than other field guides due to its inclusion of seemingly obscure yet important details, such as how to get to lemur watching sites, travel time, where to stay, mentions of lesser-known sites, listings of species to be seen, best times to observe, and even, among other things, the number of habituated lemur groups in each area. Tecot noted that the lemur checklist promoted competitive lemur watching, similar to <a href="birdwatching">birdwatching</a>, and that the color-coded sections assisted in "on-the-fly species identification." Although very satisfied with the information provided for each species, Tecot commended the promise made in this edition to more extensively cover the published literature in the upcoming third edition. Like its predecessor, the second edition was praised as an excellent tool for ecotourists and researchers. It was also noted for its attempt to promote ecotourism as a conservation strategy.

This newer edition was also mentioned briefly in the 2006 edition (volume 11) of "Lemur News". The publication announcement highlighted the extensive coverage of scientific information throughout a range of chapters and appendices. The edition is said to contain over 200 illustrations, including drawings, photos, and maps.

The 2010 third edition was reviewed in "Lemur News" by Alex Dunkel. He praised the increased level of detail in the new edition, which adds additional information on geology, the history of lemur research, and numerous aspects of lemur biology. Efforts to conserve lemurs have faced steep challenges, Dunkel wrote, due to <a href="2009%20Malagasy%20political%20crisis">political and economic instability</a> in Madagascar, and these challenges make the new edition especially important. However, he worried that the increased size of the book made it less portable than its predecessors.

While the first edition recognized 50 lemur <a href="taxon">taxa</a> (32 <a href="species">species</a> and 25 <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>), the second edition recognized 71 lemur taxa (68 species and 5 subspecies) just 12 years later. The second edition followed the recommendations of <a href="Colin%20Groves">Colin Groves</a> in the third edition of "<a href="Mammal%20Species%20of%20the%20World">Mammal Species of the World</a>" from 2005 by recognizing newly identified nocturnal species and raising many former subspecies to species status. For comparison, Tattersall's book "Primates of Madagascar" from 1982 listed only 20 species and 29 subspecies. Following the publication of the second edition, Nick Garbutt recognized 87 species and 5 subspecies in his book "Mammals of Madagascar".

Not all lemur researchers agree with the species promotions supported by these books. Researchers such as Tattersall and <a href="Anne%20D.%20Yoder">Anne D. Yoder</a>, director of the <a href="Duke%20Lemur%20Center">Duke Lemur Center</a>, have raised concerns about taxonomic inflation. In particular, Tattersall has noted a steep decline in <a href="Monotypic%20taxon">polytypic</a> lemur species, or species with defined subspecies, starting with the first edition of "Lemurs of Madagascar" and becoming more pronounced in the second edition. He noted that more than half of the new species added in the second edition were promoted subspecies and questioned whether Madagascar could produce so many <a href="Monotypic%20taxon">monotypic</a> species.

Prior to the release of the third edition of "Lemurs of Madagascar", many of the major contributors, as well as Colin Groves, teamed up in 2008 to compile an updated lemur species list, published under the title "Lemur diversity in Madagascar" in the "International Journal of Primatology". In it, 99 lemur taxa were recognized (97 species and 3 subspecies). The third edition went on to recognize 101 lemur taxa (97 species and 6 subspecies) and suggested that future research could reveal as many as 110 to 125 taxa.

God of War: Ghost of Sparta

God of War: Ghost of Sparta is a <a href="Third-person%20%28video%20games%29">third-person</a> <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by <a href="Ready%20at%20Dawn">Ready at Dawn</a> and <a href="SCE%20Santa%20Monica%20Studio">Santa Monica Studio</a>, and published by <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a> (SCE). It was first released for the <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> (PSP) <a href="handheld%20video%20game%20console">handheld console</a> on November 2, 2010. The game is the sixth installment in the <a href="God%20of%20War%20%28franchise%29">"God of War" series</a> and the fourth chronologically. Loosely based on <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, "Ghost of Sparta" is set in <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a> with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls the protagonist <a href="Kratos%20%28God%20of%20War%29">Kratos</a>, the God of War. Kratos is still haunted by the visions of his mortal past and decides to explore his origins. In <a href="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>, he finds his mother Callisto, who claims that his brother Deimos is still alive. Kratos journeys to the Domain of Death to rescue his brother. After initial resentment from Deimos, the brothers team up to battle the God of Death, <a href="Thanatos">Thanatos</a>.

The gameplay is similar to that of the previous installments, and focuses on <a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combo-based</a> combat, achieved through the player's main weapon—the Blades of Athena—and a secondary weapon acquired later in the game. It features <a href="quick%20time%20event">quick time event</a>s that require the player to complete various game controller actions in a timed sequence to defeat stronger enemies and <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">bosses</a>. Up to three magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability can be used as alternative combat options. "Ghost of Sparta" also features <a href="puzzle%20video%20game">puzzles</a> and <a href="platform%20game">platforming</a> elements. The combat system was updated with 25 percent more gameplay than its PSP predecessor, "".

"Ghost of Sparta" received praise for its story, gameplay, and graphics. Several critics consider it to be the best-looking game on the PSP. Others have compared the overall game to those on the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> (PS3), and some have said that the graphics are better than those of the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> (PS2). "Ghost of Sparta" received several awards, including "Best Handheld Game", "Best PSP Game", and "PSP Game of Show" at the <a href="E3%202010">2010</a> <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3), and "Best Handheld Game" at the 2010 <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a>. By June 2012, it had sold almost 1.2 million copies worldwide, making it the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20video%20games%23PlayStation%20Portable">fifteenth best-selling PlayStation Portable game of all time</a>. Together with "Chains of Olympus", "Ghost of Sparta" was remastered and released on September 13, 2011, as part of the "" and the remastered version was re-released on August 28, 2012, as part of the "<a href="God%20of%20War%20video%20game%20collections%23God%20of%20War%20Saga">God of War Saga</a>", both for the PlayStation 3.

The gameplay of "God of War: Ghost of Sparta" resembles that of the previous installments. It is a <a href="Third-person%20%28video%20games%29">third-person</a> <a href="single-player%20video%20game">single player</a> video game viewed from a <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system%23Fixed">fixed camera</a> perspective. The player controls the character Kratos in <a href="hack%20and%20slash">hack and slash</a> <a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combo-based combat</a>, <a href="Platform%20game">platforming</a>, and <a href="Puzzle%20video%20game">puzzle game</a> elements, and battles foes who primarily stem from <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, including <a href="minotaur">minotaur</a>s, <a href="cyclops">cyclopes</a>, <a href="harpies">harpies</a>, <a href="Gorgons">Gorgons</a>, and <a href="satyr">satyr</a>s. The undead legionnaires, <a href="Keres%20%28mythology%29">keres wraiths</a>, <a href="geryon">geryon</a>s, <a href="automaton">automaton</a>s, <a href="Boreas%20%28god%29">Boreas</a> beasts, and <a href="Triton%20%28mythology%29">Triton warriors</a> were influenced by the mythology, but created specifically for the game. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls, jump across chasms, swing on ropes, and balance across <a href="Beam%20%28structure%29">beams</a> to proceed through sections of the game. Some puzzles are simple, such as moving a box so that the player can use it to access a pathway unreachable with normal jumping, but others are more complex, such as finding several items across different areas of the game to unlock one door. The game features new weapons, magical powers, and navigational abilities not present in previous games and has been cited as featuring 25 percent more gameplay than "".

Kratos' main weapon is the Blades of Athena, a pair of <a href="blade">blade</a>s attached to <a href="Chain%20weapon">chains</a> that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. Later in the game, Kratos acquires a new weapon, the Arms of Sparta—a spear and shield offering alternative combat options (e.g., Kratos can use the shield for defense and the spear for offense, such as throwing it at distant targets). Kratos gains a <a href="Superpower%20%28ability%29">special ability</a>, Thera's Bane, that infuses his blades with fire, and is similar to the Rage ability in previous games, providing increased attack damage that is strong enough to pierce through enemy armor. As with the Items in "<a href="God%20of%20War%20III">God of War III</a>", this ability automatically replenishes itself (represented by the Fire meter), allowing further usage. Both the Arms of Sparta and Thera's Bane are used to overcome environmental obstacles (e.g., certain doors require the use of Thera's Bane to open). Kratos learns to use up to three <a href="Magic%20%28gaming%29">magical</a> abilities, including the Eye of Atlantis, Scourge of Erinys, and the Horn of Boreas, giving him a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies. The relic <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a>'s Trident is retained from the <a href="God%20of%20War%20%282005%20video%20game%29">prior installment</a>, which allows him to breathe underwater, a necessary ability as parts of the game require long periods of time there.

The combat system has been updated to allow Kratos to "pummel enemies to the ground as well as throw them", and perform air-to-air attacks. An "augmented death system" is also used, featuring specific weapon and magic death animations. This game's challenge mode is called the Challenge of the Gods, which features five Challenges of Ares, with an additional eight Challenges of Athena that can be unlocked. The challenge mode requires players to complete a series of specific tasks (e.g., kill all enemies without being attacked). A new mode exclusive to this game has been added called The Temple of Zeus, which allows players to sacrifice collected red orbs (from both in-game and the challenge mode) to unlock additional features, such as the Challenges of Athena, bonus costumes for Kratos, behind-the-scenes videos, and <a href="concept%20art">concept art</a> of the characters and environments. Completing each difficulty level unlocks additional rewards. A Combat Arena (similar to the version in "God of War III") allows players to pick adversaries and adjust the level of difficulty to improve their skills.

As with previous games in the "<a href="God%20of%20War%20%28franchise%29">God of War</a>" franchise, "God of War: Ghost of Sparta" is set in an alternate version of <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a> populated by the <a href="Twelve%20Olympians">Olympian Gods</a>, <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titans</a>, and other beings from Greek mythology. With the exception of <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashbacks</a>, the events are set between the games "<a href="God%20of%20War%20%282005%20video%20game%29">God of War</a>" (2005) and "" (2007). Several locations are explored, including the fictional city of <a href="Atlantis">Atlantis</a> (and later a sunken version). Atlantis is a mythical city erected by the Sea God Poseidon, and houses the Temple of Poseidon. Near the city is a real-world location, the <a href="Methana%20Volcano">Methana Volcano</a>, which is contained by the <a href="archimedean%20screw">archimedean screw</a>s and is also the prison of the Titan Thera, who is guarded by automatons. On the outskirts of the city is the Temple of the god <a href="Thanatos">Thanatos</a>, the location of Death's Gate and portal to the Domain of Death. Other locations include the Island of <a href="Crete">Crete</a> and its capital city, <a href="Heraklion">Heraklion</a>, the Mounts of <a href="Aroania">Aroania</a>, the ancient city of <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a> (also home to the Temple of <a href="Ares">Ares</a>), the Mounts of <a href="Laconia">Laconia</a>, and a brief scene above the city of <a href="Classical%20Athens">Athens</a> featuring Suicide Bluffs, the highest cliff in the city overlooking the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> and a recurring location during Kratos' adventures.

The protagonist of the game is <a href="Kratos%20%28God%20of%20War%29">Kratos</a> (voiced by <a href="Terrence%20C.%20Carson">Terrence C. Carson</a>), the God of War after having killed the former, Ares (who appears in flashbacks and voiced by <a href="Steven%20Blum">Steven Blum</a>). Other characters include Athena (<a href="Erin%20Torpey">Erin Torpey</a>), the Goddess of Wisdom who warns Kratos about exploring his past; Deimos (<a href="Mark%20Deklin">Mark Deklin</a>), the younger brother of Kratos and imprisoned and tortured in the Domain of Death; Thanatos (<a href="Arthur%20Burghardt">Arthur Burghardt</a>), the God of Death and main antagonist; Callisto (<a href="Deanna%20Hurstold">Deanna Hurstold</a>), the mother of Kratos and Deimos; Thera (<a href="Dee%20Dee%20Rescher">Dee Dee Rescher</a>), a Titan imprisoned beneath the Methana Volcano; and <a href="Erinyes">Erinys</a> (Erin Torpey and <a href="Jennifer%20Hale">Jennifer Hale</a>), Thanatos' daughter. Minor characters include Lanaeus (<a href="Fred%20Tatasciore">Fred Tatasciore</a>); a servant of Poseidon; <a href="Midas">King Midas</a> (Fred Tatasciore), a king whose touch will turn anything to gold; the gravedigger (<a href="Paul%20Eiding">Paul Eiding</a>), who warns Kratos to not alienate the gods; a loyal Spartan soldier (<a href="Gideon%20Emery">Gideon Emery</a>); and Poseidon (Gideon Emery), the God of the Sea. <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> (Fred Tatasciore), the King of the Gods, appears in the "Combat Arena" (bonus feature) after the player selects the gravedigger.

A series of flashbacks reveals that an oracle had foretold that the demise of Olympus would come not by the revenge of the Titans, who had been imprisoned after the <a href="Titanomachy">Great War</a>, but by a marked warrior. The Olympians Zeus and Ares believed this warrior to be Deimos, the brother of Kratos, due to his strange birthmarks. Ares interrupted the childhood training of Kratos and Deimos, with Athena on hand, and kidnapped Deimos. Kratos attempted to stop Ares, but was swept aside and subsequently scarred across his right eye by the Olympian. Athena stopped Ares from killing Kratos, knowing his eventual destiny. Taken to Death's Domain, Deimos was imprisoned and tortured by Thanatos. In honor of his sibling, Kratos marked himself with a red tattoo, identical to his brother's birthmark.

Years later, when the game begins, Kratos has taken Ares' place as the new God of War on Mount Olympus. Still haunted by visions of his mortal past, Kratos decides against Athena's advice to explore his past and travels to the Temple of Poseidon, located within the city of Atlantis. The sea monster, <a href="Scylla">Scylla</a>, attacks and destroys Kratos' vessel off the coast of Atlantis, though the Spartan drives the beast off. After a series of skirmishes across the city, he eventually kills Scylla.

Reaching the temple, Kratos locates his mother, Callisto, who attempts to reveal the identity of his father. When Callisto is suddenly transformed into a hideous beast, Kratos is forced to battle her, and before dying, Callisto thanks him and beseeches him to seek out Deimos in Sparta. Prior to departure, Kratos encounters and frees the trapped Titan, Thera, which causes the eruption of the <a href="Methana%20Volcano">Methana Volcano</a>, and subsequently destroys the city. During his escape, he has <a href="God%20of%20War%20%282005%20video%20game%29%23Plot">another encounter</a> with the enigmatic gravedigger, who warns him of the consequences of alienating the gods.

After a battle with Erinys, Kratos arrives in Sparta and witnesses a group of Spartans tearing down a statue of Ares, intent on replacing it with one of Kratos. Kratos then chases a <a href="dissenter">dissenter</a> loyal to Ares into the Spartan Jails, who attempts to kill Kratos by releasing the <a href="Piraeus%20Lion">Piraeus Lion</a>. Defeating both foes, Kratos journeys to the Temple of Ares, where he encounters the <a href="spirit">spirit</a> of his child self and learns that he must return to the now sunken Atlantis and locate the Domain of Death. Before leaving, a loyal Spartan provides him with his former weapons—used during Kratos' days as a Captain of the Spartan army—the Arms of Sparta. After returning to the sunken Atlantis, Kratos receives great resentment from Poseidon for sinking his beloved city.

Entering the Domain of Death, the Spartan frees his imprisoned brother. Enraged that Kratos had failed to rescue him sooner and stating he will never forgive him, Deimos attacks and overpowers Kratos. However, Thanatos intervenes and takes a protesting Deimos to Suicide Bluffs (the site of Kratos' <a href="God%20of%20War%20%282005%20video%20game%29%23Plot">suicide attempt</a>), where Kratos saves Deimos from falling to his death. A grateful Deimos then aids his brother in battling the god with the Arms of Sparta. At this point, Thanatos realizes Ares chose the wrong Spartan; it was Kratos who should have been taken, the "mark" being his red tattoo. Thanatos, however, kills Deimos but is destroyed, in turn, by Kratos. Remarking that his brother is finally free, Kratos places Deimos in his grave (leaving the Arms of Sparta as a grave marker), while the gravedigger states that Kratos has become "Death... the Destroyer of Worlds." Athena appears, begs for forgiveness, and offers full godhood for not revealing the truth, but Kratos ignores her and returns to Olympus, promising that "the gods will pay for this." As Kratos is seen leaving, Athena looks apologetically at Kratos and whispers out of his earshot, "Forgive me... brother."

In a <a href="post-credits%20scene">post-credits scene</a>, the gravedigger places Callisto in a grave by Deimos (with an empty third grave nearby) and states "Now... only one remains." The final scene is a brooding Kratos sitting on his throne on Mount Olympus.

"God of War: Ghost of Sparta" was announced on May 4, 2010, on <a href="PlayStation.Blog">PlayStation.Blog</a>. According to <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony</a>, <a href="Ready%20at%20Dawn">Ready at Dawn</a> utilized "state-of-the-art visual technologies" that allowed "higher quality environments and characters." "Ghost of Sparta" offers "over 25% more gameplay" than its PSP predecessor, "Chains of Olympus", while adding more enemies on screen and a greater number of boss encounters. Development of "Ghost of Sparta" took 23 months to complete. "Chains of Olympus" game director Ru Weerasuriya did not return to direct due to his busy schedule at Ready at Dawn, so Dana Jan, the lead level designer on "Chains of Olympus", became director. At <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic-Con%20International">Comic-Con 2010</a>, Jan noted that when development began in 2008, the goal was to make the game "bigger" than "Chains of Olympus", which had "pushed" the PSP to its functional limits. Jan stated that "Ghost of Sparta" has taken the PSP to its "absolute capacity", with one additional feature being more on-screen foes. The game concept was originally used as a teaser for players who obtained the <a href="PlayStation%203%20Trophies">platinum trophy</a> from "God of War III". The trophy revealed a site called "spartansstandtall.com"—it initially featured a simple animation of torrential rain falling into a body of water and a Spartan shield encompassed by a meter on the screen. The meter was speculated to have been filled by players achieving the trophy and reaching the site. On May 4, 2010, the meter reached maximum and the site was updated for a final time, revealing an image of Kratos standing above a reflection and the logo for "God of War: Ghost of Sparta", as the official site. On June 15, 2010, Sony displayed a cinematic trailer narrated by <a href="Linda%20Hunt">Linda Hunt</a> during their <a href="E3%202010">2010</a> <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) Press Conference.

Dana Jan stated the reason they chose to have the game take place between "God of War" and "<a href="God%20of%20War%20II">God of War II</a>" was because "It seemed to make a lot of sense to fill in that void." Jan said with some scenes, "the team wasn't sure how gamers would react" because ""God of War" usually doesn't slow...down" and the team "worried if these scenes would be captivating enough to keep player interested and still feel like "God of War"." For puzzles, Jan stated that they tried to make the outcomes unexpected because players assume that they will have to "push something, carry a body or smash something with [the] blades." Hinting at a possible future installment from Ready at Dawn, Jan stated that he is "intrigued" by the flashbacks in "God of War" and "God of War II" and that "There's definitely a back story to Kratos that nobody's touched on." For the character Deimos, Jan stated that the first reference was actually in the "Chains of Olympus" finale. In the game, Helios states "Do you think that they'll survive?" and Athena says "They must." Jan said that this line was "purposefully put" in that game and that there are also references to Deimos in "God of War III". He confirmed that Kratos and Deimos are not twins and that while Kratos' father is Zeus, "Deimos' father is more of a mystery." He confirmed that a character named Dominus appears in the game (Kratos' original name) and "the scene featuring a soldier named Dominus was a nod to that." He also stated that he does not know where "God of War: Betrayal" fits chronologically in the series.

Several voice actors returned to reprise their roles from previous installments, including Terrence C. Carson, Erin Torpey, Gideon Emery, Steven Blum, Paul Eiding, and Linda Hunt, who voiced Kratos, Athena, Poseidon, Ares, the gravedigger, and the narrator, respectively. Actors Mark Deklin and Arthur Burghardt voiced the characters of Deimos and Thanatos, respectively. During flashbacks to Kratos' childhood, <a href="Antony%20Del%20Rio">Antony Del Rio</a>, <a href="Bridger%20Zadina">Bridger Zadina</a>, and Jennifer Hale provided the respective voices of Kratos, Deimos, and Callisto. Both Erin Torpey and Jennifer Hale voiced the character Erinys via <a href="overdubbed">overdubbed</a> voices. <a href="Josh%20Keaton">Josh Keaton</a>, who had previously voiced the loyal Spartan soldier (credited as the Last Spartan), did not return to reprise the role, and as such, Gideon Emery voiced the character in addition to Poseidon. Series veteran Fred Tatasciore voiced the characters Lanaeus, King Midas, and the minor role of Zeus. The voice directors were <a href="Kris%20Zimmerman">Kris Zimmerman</a> and <a href="Gordon%20Hunt%20%28director%29">Gordon Hunt</a>.

The <a href="Game%20demo">demo</a> for "God of War: Ghost of Sparta" was available for play at Sony's E3 2010 booth to attendees of the event. The 15-minute sequence pits Kratos against various sea and land enemies, including the main opponent Scylla, a sea monster. The sequence also features Kratos using a new weapon, "Arms of Sparta" (a spear and shield), and the magical attack, "Eye of Atlantis. " On September 3, 2010, Ready at Dawn emailed registrants of GodofWar.com and SpartansStandTall.com a voucher for the demo and on September 7, <a href="PlayStation%20Plus">PlayStation Plus</a> members received early access to it. On September 28, the demo was made available to all <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a> (PSN) members to download from the <a href="PlayStation%20Store">PlayStation Store</a>.

The game was released in North America on November 2, 2010, in mainland Europe on November 3, in Australia and New Zealand on November 4, and in the United Kingdom and Ireland on November 5. By June 2012, "God of War: Ghost of Sparta" had sold almost 1.2 million copies worldwide. Together with "God of War: Chains of Olympus", the game was released as part of the "" on September 13, 2011, in North America and September 16 in Europe. The collection is a remastered port of both games to the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>, with features including <a href="high-definition%20video">high-definition</a> resolution, <a href="stereoscopic%203D">stereoscopic 3D</a>, <a href="anti-aliasing%20filter">anti-aliased</a> graphics locked in at 60 frames per second, <a href="DualShock%203">DualShock 3</a> vibration function, and <a href="PlayStation%203%20Trophies">Trophies</a>. "God of War: Origins Collection" was also released to download on the PlayStation Store on September 13 in North America (including full game trials of both games). By June 2012, "God of War: Origins Collection" had sold 711,737 copies worldwide. On August 28, 2012, "<a href="God%20of%20War%20Collection">God of War Collection</a>", "God of War III", and "Origins Collection" were released as part of the "<a href="God%20of%20War%20video%20game%20collections%23God%20of%20War%20Saga">God of War Saga</a>" under Sony's line of PlayStation Collections for the PlayStation 3 in North America.

As a pre-order bonus at select retailers, players received exclusive <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> (DLC) available via the PlayStation Network. The content included the original soundtrack, a "Ghost of Sparta" PSP <a href="XrossMediaBar">XrossMediaBar</a> (XMB) theme, a PS3 dynamic XMB theme ("Palace of Hades"), a PSN Avatar, a Legionnaire Skin for use in-game, and an exclusive documentary, "<a href="God%20of%20War%20%28franchise%29%23Film%20and%20documentaries">God of War – Game Directors Live</a>". <a href="PSPgo">PSPgo</a> owners received the pre-order items by purchasing the game between November 2 and 23, 2010, on the PlayStation Store. <a href="GameStop">GameStop</a> offered an exclusive Challenge arena, "The Forest of the Forgotten", in addition to the other bonuses.

"Ghost of Sparta" was also available in a special limited edition PSP bundle pack, which included the game, a voucher to download "Chains of Olympus", a <a href="Universal%20Media%20Disc">UMD</a> of the 2010 film "<a href="Kick-Ass%20%28film%29">Kick-Ass</a>", a 2 GB Memory Stick Pro Duo, and a special black and red two-toned <a href="PSP-3000">PSP-3000</a>. For a limited time, specially marked packages included a voucher enabling a download of the "Deimos Skin" for use in "God of War III". The Deimos Skin was available in the PSP bundle pack, and PSPgo owners received the bonus skin with the pre-order items. In Europe, the Deimos Skin can still be obtained by purchasing "Ghost of Sparta" from the PlayStation Store.

"God of War: Ghost of Sparta – Original Soundtrack from the Video Game"—composed by <a href="Gerard%20Marino">Gerard K. Marino</a> and <a href="Mike%20Reagan">Mike Reagan</a>—was released on <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a> on October 18, 2010, by Sony Computer Entertainment and includes three bonus tracks from "Chains of Olympus". It was also included as downloadable content in the "Ghost of Sparta" pre-order package. Square Enix Music Online (8/10) stated that several tracks were intended for purely contextual purposes, with the remainder of the soundtrack rating well in comparison to the soundtracks of the main installments in the series.

"God of War: Ghost of Sparta" received generally favourable reviews. Nicole Tanner of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> stated that in terms of gameplay, "there's nothing unique here, but that's not a bad thing." <a href="1UP.com">1UP</a>'s Chris Pereira said that the controls are "largely the same" as "Chains of Olympus", but it "is still an extremely well-paced action game." He said that it is put together so well that it is worth playing, "unless you've become truly tired of the franchise". <a href="Joystiq">Joystiq</a>'s Randy Nelson stated that the scope of the game seems like it "was planned for release on consoles", but "if you were hoping for something really innovative, you're out of luck." Joe Juba of "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" stated that "the other core fighting mechanics are familiar, but the tweaks go a long way toward improving gameplay". "" stated ""[Ghost of] Sparta" offers an immersive experience on par with many of the best PS3 games". Simon Parkin of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> praised the battle system as strong, however, he stated "There is a sense that "Ghost of Sparta" is a step back for the series" and claimed that it is "best enjoyed by newcomers" or "those yet to play" "God of War III".

Praising its story, Pereira claimed that it is "a more personal story than the other GOW games, but one that still features the series' signature trademarks", and also said that the sex mini-game is "arguably the most over-the-top of the bunch". Nelson stated that it is "a game that upholds the standard of quality in gameplay, storytelling and sheer wow factor of the series, while also—like "" before it—blurring the lines between portable and console experiences with its amazing presentation." Juba said that it "doesn’t have any mind-blowing moments", but "this isn’t an optional side-story; "Ghost of Sparta" is a must-play for "God of War" fans." <a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a> said it has a "pretty cool story" that will "definitely feel familiar". Parkin, however, stated the "game's primary problem...is in its in-built focus" and that the series "is principally concerned with endlessly upping the ante." He also claimed that the developers have "[taken] away the sense of wonder" that is expected of a "God of War" game and stated "the remaining components struggle to carry the experience."

In terms of visuals, Tanner stated that the graphics are "better than a big chunk of PS2 games" and that it is the "best-looking game on the PSP thus far." Pereira said that it looks as good if not better than other handheld games available. Nelson said the graphics are "the best you've ever seen on a handheld." He also said that it makes the first two "God of War" games on the PlayStation 2 look dated. GameTrailers said "you'll be treated to the very best visuals the PSP has to offer". Parkin described the set-pieces as "incredible" for a handheld platform, however, he stated they "seem tired" in comparison to the opening scenes of "God of War III".

At E3 2010, "Ghost of Sparta" received nine awards, including "Best Handheld Game", "Best PSP Game", and "PSP Game of Show" from several media outlets, as well as three nominations. "PlayStation: The Official Magazine" awarded it the "Gold Award". <a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a> awarded it "Editor's Choice", stating ""God of War: Ghost of Sparta" is a palm-sized epic video game." At the <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">2010 Spike Video Game Awards</a>, it received "Best Handheld Game". At the 2011 <a href="7th%20British%20Academy%20Video%20Games%20Awards">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a> (BAFTA) Video Game Awards, "Ghost of Sparta" was a nominee for the "Handheld" award.

Ben Gascoigne

Sidney Charles Bartholemew "Ben" Gascoigne (11 November 191525 March 2010) was a New Zealand-born Australian <a href="optical%20astronomy">optical astronomer</a> and expert in <a href="photometry%20%28astronomy%29">photometry</a> who played a leading role in the design and commissioning of Australia's largest optical telescope, the <a href="Anglo-Australian%20Telescope">Anglo-Australian Telescope</a>, which for a time was one of the world's most important astronomical facilities. Born in <a href="Napier%2C%20New%20Zealand">Napier, New Zealand</a>, Gascoigne trained in <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a> and at the <a href="University%20of%20Bristol">University of Bristol</a>, before moving to Australia during World War II to work at the <a href="Mount%20Stromlo%20Observatory">Commonwealth Solar Observatory</a> at <a href="Mount%20Stromlo">Mount Stromlo</a> in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>. He became skillful in the design and manufacture of <a href="optical%20device">optical device</a>s such as telescope elements.

Following the war, Gascoigne and astronomer Gerald Kron used newly modernised telescopes at Mount Stromlo to determine that the distance between <a href="Milky%20Way">our galaxy</a> and the <a href="Magellanic%20Cloud">Magellanic Cloud</a> dwarf galaxies had been underestimated by a factor of two. Because this measurement was used to calibrate other distances in astronomy, the result effectively doubled the estimated size of the universe. They also found that star formation in the Magellanic Clouds had occurred more recently than in the Milky Way; this overturned the prevailing view that both had evolved in parallel. A major figure at <a href="Mount%20Stromlo%20Observatory">Mount Stromlo Observatory</a>, Gascoigne helped it develop from a solar observatory to a centre of stellar and galactic research, and was instrumental in the creation of its field observatory in northern New South Wales, <a href="Siding%20Spring%20Observatory">Siding Spring Observatory</a>. When the British and Australian governments agreed to jointly build the <a href="Anglo-Australian%20Telescope">Anglo-Australian Telescope</a> at Siding Spring, Gascoigne was involved from its initial conception and throughout its lengthy commissioning, taking its <a href="First%20light%20%28astronomy%29">first photograph</a>. Gascoigne was made an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia">Officer of the Order of Australia</a> for his contributions to astronomy and to the Anglo-Australian Telescope.

Gascoigne and his wife, artist <a href="Rosalie%20Gascoigne">Rosalie Gascoigne</a>, had three children. After he retired, Gascoigne wrote several works on Australian astronomical history. He acted as Rosalie's photographer and assistant, using his technical skills to make her artworks resilient for public display.

Ben Gascoigne's parents met and married in <a href="Levin%2C%20New%20Zealand">Levin, New Zealand</a>, just before the First World War. They soon moved to <a href="Napier%2C%20New%20Zealand">Napier</a>, where Gascoigne was born in 1915. He attended <a href="Auckland%20Grammar%20School">Auckland Grammar School</a>, and won a scholarship to Auckland University College (now the <a href="University%20of%20Auckland">University of Auckland</a>) a year before he was due to finish high school. Faced with a choice between studying history or the sciences, he chose the latter because he had a severe stammer and thought that it would be less of an impediment. He completed both a <a href="Bachelor%27s%20degree">Bachelor's degree</a> and a Master's qualification in science, securing Honours in both mathematics and physics, finishing his studies in 1937. Despite these achievements, he did not consider himself to be practically trained, saying: "I was still very much a theorist, with no practical physics at all. The professor in Auckland used to wince when I walked past the cupboard in which the good instruments were kept!"

In 1933, while studying at the University, he met his future wife Rosalie Norah King Walker, although they did not marry for another decade. Rosalie completed a Bachelor of Arts while Gascoigne was studying in Auckland; she also studied at Auckland's teacher training college while he was in <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>. 
Although Gascoigne had always intended to study mathematics at Cambridge, an event occurred that significantly shaped his career. In 1931, an <a href="1931%20Hawke%27s%20Bay%20earthquake">earthquake in New Zealand</a> killed Michael Hiatt Baker, a young traveller from Bristol, and his parents established a postgraduate scholarship in his memory, for study at the <a href="University%20of%20Bristol">University of Bristol</a>, which Gascoigne won and took up in 1938. During his thesis studies at Bristol, Gascoigne developed a <a href="diffraction">diffraction</a> theory of the <a href="Amateur%20telescope%20making%23Foucault%20test">Foucault test</a> that is used for evaluating the shape of large telescope mirrors. He completed his doctorate in physics in 1941, but by then war had broken out in Europe, and he had already returned to New Zealand on the last available ship.

Returning to a job in the physics department at Auckland, Gascoigne worked on military <a href="optics">optics</a>, developing <a href="gun%20sight">gun sight</a>s and <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a>s, although he did not remain there for long. <a href="Richard%20van%20der%20Riet%20Woolley">Richard van der Riet Woolley</a>, director of the Commonwealth Solar Observatory in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> (now <a href="Mount%20Stromlo%20Observatory">Mount Stromlo Observatory</a>), sought out Gascoigne because his "experience in optical work [was] unique" and Gascoigne was "trained in a way that no one else in Australia has been qualified". When in 1941 Gascoigne was offered a research fellowship by Woolley, he moved to Canberra. The Solar Observatory staff had similar responsibilities to those Gascoigne had held in New Zealand. His first task was to design an anti-aircraft gun sight, and he was also involved in a range of other military optical projects. In 1944, the Melbourne Observatory, home to the Commonwealth Time Service, was closed. Gascoigne reestablished the Time Service at Mount Stromlo, using two <a href="Shortt-Synchronome%20clock">Shortt-Synchronome clock</a>s and astronomical observing equipment that he and his colleagues adapted; the Time Service remained at Mount Stromlo until 1968. The knowledge and experience Gascoigne gained during the war proved valuable. He was at the only facility in Australia where optical work could be done, from design and manufacture to assembly and testing. Gascoigne developed a wide range of skills and "finished up quite practical, especially with a screwdriver."

A decade after Gascoigne first met Rosalie in New Zealand, she travelled to Canberra, and on 9 January 1943 they were married. Their first son, Martin, was born in November, and their second, Thomas, was born in 1945.

Following the end of the war Woolley redirected the Commonwealth Observatory from solar research towards the study of stars and galaxies. It took time to get the old and unused telescopes back up to working condition: they had to be overhauled and refurbished, and in one case rebuilt from scrap. Woolley got funding approval from the <a href="Ben%20Chifley">Prime Minister</a> for construction of a 74-inch telescope, but it would not be finished for years. Gascoigne began to work in the nascent field of photoelectric <a href="Photometry%20%28astronomy%29">photometry</a>, using electrical devices to measure the brightness of stars more accurately than had been possible using photographic techniques. In 1951, with equipment brought by visiting astronomer <a href="Gerald%20Kron">Gerald Kron</a> from California's <a href="Lick%20Observatory">Lick Observatory</a>, he observed <a href="Cepheid%20variable">Cepheid variable</a> stars, which are used to <a href="Cosmic%20distance%20ladder">measure astronomical distances</a>. Granted nine months of observing time on the Observatory's Reynolds 30-inch <a href="reflector%20telescope">reflector telescope</a> – an extraordinary opportunity – Gascoigne, Kron and others surveyed Cepheid stars in both the <a href="Small%20Magellanic%20Cloud">Small Magellanic Cloud</a> and, later, the <a href="Large%20Magellanic%20Cloud">Large Magellanic Cloud</a>. They also examined the colours of <a href="star%20cluster">star cluster</a>s in the Small Cloud.
The research produced remarkable results: "it meant that the Magellanic Clouds were twice as far away as was previously thought, and if then the baseline is twice as long, the size of the universe is doubled." It also showed that star formation in the Magellanic Clouds had occurred more recently than in the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>. The results overturned the prevailing view that our galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds had evolved in parallel. Gascoigne said of his work:

In 1949, the Gascoignes' third child, daughter Hester, was born. Like many Observatory personnel, the Gascoignes lived in a staff residence on <a href="Mount%20Stromlo">Mount Stromlo</a>, which was a long difficult trip away from Canberra. It was cold and lonely, particularly for Rosalie, but they enjoyed the outdoors, and the landscape inspired Rosalie's creativity and later her artistic career. In 1960 they relocated to <a href="Deakin%2C%20Canberra">Deakin</a> in suburban Canberra, and in the late 1960s they moved to another suburb, <a href="Pearce%2C%20Canberra">Pearce</a>.

In 1957, administrative responsibility for the Commonwealth Observatory was transferred from the Australian Government's Department of the Interior to the <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a> (ANU), a move supported by both its director, Richard Woolley, and Gascoigne. This was an era of significant change at Mount Stromlo: in January 1956 Woolley had resigned as director of Mount Stromlo to take up a position as <a href="Astronomer%20Royal">Astronomer Royal</a> and director of the <a href="Royal%20Observatory%20Greenwich">Royal Observatory Greenwich</a>. He was replaced by <a href="Bart%20Bok">Bart Bok</a>, whom Gascoigne liked and under whose directorship he played a significant role. Also in 1957, the Mount Stromlo team began searching for a new field observatory site, due to the increased <a href="light%20pollution">light pollution</a> from Canberra's growth. The search was vigorously promoted by Bok, and after an examination of 20 possible locations, two were shortlisted: Mount Bingar, near <a href="Griffith%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Griffith, New South Wales</a>, and Siding Spring, near <a href="Coonabarabran%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Coonabarabran, New South Wales</a>. Gascoigne was one of a group of scientists who visited Siding Spring Mountain as part of the search, and he was one of those who advocated this choice:

In 1962, Siding Spring was selected, and by 1967 <a href="Siding%20Spring%20Observatory">Siding Spring Observatory</a> was fully operational.

At the end of Woolley's directorship, the 74-inch telescope he had initiated finally came online. Gascoigne, looking for a new research project and keen to use the new telescope, took up the study of <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a>s, compact groups of tens of thousands of ancient stars of similar age. With a new design of <a href="photometer">photometer</a>, he was able to measure the exceptionally faint stars in these clusters. Gascoigne determined that the clusters in the Magellanic Clouds were both young and old, and had quite different characteristics to those in the Milky Way: this information was important for modelling the <a href="Galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution">evolution of galaxies</a>.

In 1963, Gascoigne developed a device, known as an optical corrector plate, which allowed <a href="field%20of%20view">wide field</a> photography on the new 40-inch telescope at Siding Spring. Such corrector plates were subsequently used on many telescopes and became known as Gascoigne correctors. During this period he was also active in supporting the establishment of a national research organisation for astronomers, the <a href="Astronomical%20Society%20of%20Australia">Astronomical Society of Australia</a>. It held its first meeting in 1966, and Gascoigne was made its first vice-president.

When Bok retired as Stromlo's director in early 1966, Gascoigne became acting director for three months until the arrival of Bok's replacement, American astronomer <a href="Olin%20J.%20Eggen">Olin J. Eggen</a>. Eggen was an enormously productive scientist, but was "enigmatic", "somewhat gruff" and selective in the friendships he formed. Although Eggen and Gascoigne had previously collaborated on research projects, when Eggen arrived to take up the post, he and Gascoigne did not get on well, in contrast to Gascoigne's relationships with other astronomers. Gascoigne said of Eggen: "he made it clear I had no further part in running the Observatory. I was given no information, saw no documents, attended no meetings, and was asked for no advice, not even in optical matters."

In 1963 Gascoigne published an article in the journal "Nature" titled "Towards a Southern Commonwealth Observatory".
Gascoigne was then given a significant opportunity that became the focus of the remainder of his paid academic career: to help establish one of the world's largest optical telescopes, at Siding Spring. In the early 1960s, the Australian and British governments proposed a partnership to build a joint optical telescope facility, and Gascoigne was among the experts involved. Former Mount Stromlo director and now head of the Greenwich observatory, Richard Woolley, was prominent in supporting the project from the British end. In 1967, the two governments formally agreed to collaborate on the construction of a large telescope, to be known as the <a href="Anglo-Australian%20Telescope">Anglo-Australian Telescope</a> (AAT). Given the existing infrastructure of the ANU's Siding Spring Observatory, the site was readily agreed as the location for the AAT. Gascoigne was one of the four members of the Technical Committee established to guide the telescope's development. He provided leadership on the design and optics of the new telescope, and was made the chief commissioning astronomer in 1974.

A bitter struggle over the management and operation of the new facility went on for some years. The Australian National University and the director at Stromlo, Olin Eggen, wanted the telescope to be under the control of the University while other Australian astronomers, including some at Stromlo, and the British wanted it established independently. Gascoigne's co-authored history of the telescope states that "None of the eight <a href="list%20of%20Fellows%20of%20the%20Australian%20Academy%20of%20Science">fellow of the Australian Academy of Science</a> [Gascoigne was one of them] supported the ANU" and in 1973 the debate was resolved in favour of an independent structure, the <a href="Anglo-Australian%20Observatory">Anglo-Australian Observatory</a>. Gascoigne was one of only a few Stromlo employees who ended up working on the AAT for an extended period during its establishment phase: the Anglo-Australian Observatory chose to offer short-term positions rather than <a href="tenure">academic tenure</a> like that at the ANU.

The work at Siding Spring was rewarding, but it could also be dangerous. During construction, Gascoigne constantly warned colleagues to take care on the elevated catwalks around the telescope. However, Gascoigne himself was almost killed when, while working one night around the telescope structure, he fell seven metres to the floor of the observatory, narrowly missing "a massive steel structure with long protruding bolts". He survived, and was the <a href="first%20light%20%28astronomy%29">first to take a photograph</a> using the telescope, on 26 or 27 April 1974. Gascoigne was so pleased with the quality of the optics that he said he wanted a number describing the <a href="hyperboloid">hyperboloid</a> shape of the mirror (1.1717) engraved on his <a href="headstone">headstone</a>. The site quickly became one of the world's most important astronomical observatories and was for many years home to world-leading <a href="astrophotography">astrophotographer</a> <a href="David%20Malin">David Malin</a>. The successes of the AAT have been documented in annual reports by its Board, while a 2008 analysis of the <a href="impact%20factor">relative impacts</a> of astronomical observing facilities placed the AAT in the top three, coming after only the <a href="Sloan%20Digital%20Sky%20Survey">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a> and the <a href="W.%20M.%20Keck%20Observatory">W. M. Keck Observatory</a> (both telescopes built more than two decades later). For Gascoigne, it was "a wonderful thing to be associated with – the high point in my life."

It was during the period of Gascoigne's association with the Anglo-Australian telescope that he and his wife commissioned architect Theo Bischoff to design a house for them, which was planned and constructed between 1967 and 1969. Bischoff, who was responsible for numerous Canberra residences, designed a modernist home to the detailed, if contrasting, instructions from his client couple, who in turn were heavily influenced by their negative experiences with Canberra housing, particularly their home on Mount Stromlo. Based on Gascoigne's interest in optics, and Rosalie's strong visual sense as an artist, the resulting design "was based on maximising the potential for observation", creating "a form of habitable optical instrument".

By the middle of 1975, the Anglo-Australian Telescope was fully operational, and Gascoigne was offered a job with the new telescope, based in Sydney. By this time his wife was emerging as a significant artist who relied on the landscapes and materials <a href="Monaro%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">around their home</a> for her inspiration. Gascoigne decided to return to the Australian National University in Canberra; he retired a few years later in 1980, and supported Rosalie in her work. Gascoigne completed a course in welding and became his wife's assistant, making "her assemblies of 'found objects' safer and more durable". He also catalogued and photographed her work, describing himself as "artist's handyman, cook, and archivist." Rosalie Gascoigne's artistic career came lateshe was almost 60 when she held her first solo shows – and her rise was "meteoric"; five public galleries purchased works from her early exhibitions. She died in 1999. In 2008, Gascoigne donated Rosalie's final major work, a ten-panel installation titled "Earth" (1999), to the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery of Australia</a>.

As well as being an astronomer, Gascoigne was a scholar of the history of Australian astronomy. He wrote histories of major telescopes, such as the Melbourne Telescope and the AAT. He wrote biographies for the "<a href="Australian%20Dictionary%20of%20Biography">Australian Dictionary of Biography</a>", including those of the first trained astronomer at Canberra's Mount Stromlo Observatory, William Bolton Rimmer, and pioneering Australian astronomer <a href="Robert%20L.%20J.%20Ellery">Robert Ellery</a>.

Gascoigne died on 25 March 2010. A memorial service was held at <a href="St%20John%20the%20Baptist%20Church%2C%20Reid">St John's Church</a> in <a href="Reid%2C%20Canberra">Reid, Canberra</a>, on 12 April.

Gascoigne was widely respected for his astronomical skills and his generous nature. English astronomer and writer <a href="Fred%20Hoyle">Sir Fred Hoyle</a>, at one time the Chairman of the AAT, gave Gascoigne considerable credit for the telescope's success, and astronomer Harry Minnett likewise credited him, together with <a href="Roderick%20Oliver%20Redman">Roderick Oliver Redman</a>, for the telescope's extremely good optics. Former AAT director <a href="Russell%20Cannon">Russell Cannon</a> regarded Gascoigne as a world leader in his field, as well as being "a delightful man". Historian of astronomy Ragbir Bhathal considered Gascoigne to have been an important figure in Australian astronomy, responsible for substantial advances in the field.

In 1966, Gascoigne was elected a fellow of the <a href="Australian%20Academy%20of%20Science">Australian Academy of Science</a>. He was made an Honorary Fellow of the Astronomical Society of Australia; became the first person to be elected as an Honorary Member of the Optical Society of Australia; and was the first Australian to be elected as an Associate of the <a href="Royal%20Astronomical%20Society">Royal Astronomical Society</a>.
On 11 June 1996, Gascoigne was made an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia">Officer of the Order of Australia</a> for his contributions to astronomy and to the AAT. On 1 January 2001, he was awarded the <a href="Centenary%20Medal">Centenary Medal</a>, for his service to society and to astronomy.

Bombing of Yawata (June 1944)

The Bombing of Yawata on the night of 15/16 June 1944 was the first air raid on the <a href="Japanese%20Archipelago">Japanese home islands</a> conducted by <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> (USAAF) <a href="strategic%20bomber">strategic bomber</a>s during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The raid was undertaken by 75 <a href="Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress">B-29 Superfortress</a> heavy bombers staging from bases in China. Only 47 of these aircraft bombed the raid's primary target, the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at <a href="Yahata%2C%20Fukuoka">Yawata</a> in northern <a href="Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB">Kyūshū</a>, and little damage was caused. Five B-29s were lost in accidents during the operation and two were destroyed by Japanese aircraft.

While the raid did not achieve its aims, it had other effects. It raised Japanese civilians' awareness that their country was being defeated and received unduly positive media coverage in the United States. Intelligence gathered by the B-29s also revealed weaknesses in Japan's air defenses and the raid was the first of many on Japan. Yawata <a href="Bombing%20of%20Yawata">was attacked again</a> by B-29s operating from China on 20 August 1944 and much of the city was destroyed in a firebombing raid conducted by B-29s based in the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Mariana Islands</a> on 8 August 1945.

The first United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) raid on Japan took place on 18 April 1942 when 16 <a href="B-25%20Mitchell">B-25 Mitchell</a> medium bombers flying from an aircraft carrier attacked several cities during the <a href="Doolittle%20Raid">Doolittle Raid</a>. Although this raid caused little damage, it boosted morale in the United States. The Japanese government responded to the attack by both increasing the number of fighter units based in the home islands and conducting an offensive in the Pacific Ocean which ended in defeat during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a>. The USAAF was not able to mount further attacks on the Japanese home islands after this raid, however, as none of its combat aircraft had sufficient range to reach this area from bases in China or the Pacific until the B-29 Superfortress heavy bomber was ready for combat.

The B-29 Superfortress had a difficult introduction into service. Work began on designing the bomber in early 1940 and the first prototype flew on 21 September 1942. The Superfortress was the largest combat aircraft of World War II and boasted a heavy maximum bomb load, long range and powerful defensive armament. The B-29 also incorporated a number of new features such as a pressurized cabin and remote-controlled turrets. While 1,664 B-29s had been ordered by the USAAF before the aircraft first flew, its development was set back by several months after the second prototype crashed on 18 February 1943 and problems with the design were gradually solved. The <a href="58th%20Air%20Division">58th Bombardment Wing</a> was formed in June 1943 to operate the USAAF's first B-29s but it did not begin receiving these aircraft until October. The slow delivery of B-29s and mechanical problems with the aircraft meant that the wing lagged behind its training schedule, and only became capable of deployment in March 1944 after the so-called "<a href="Battle%20of%20Kansas">Battle of Kansas</a>" program began to produce combat-ready aircraft.

In late 1943 the United States <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> approved a proposal to begin the <a href="Strategic%20bombing">strategic air campaign</a> against the Japanese home islands and East Asia by basing B-29s in India and establishing forward airfields in areas of China. This strategy, which was designated <a href="Operation%20Matterhorn">Operation Matterhorn</a>, required the construction of large airstrips near <a href="Chengdu">Chengdu</a> in inland China which would be supplied by Allied cargo aircraft and be used to refuel B-29s traveling from bases in <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a> en route to bombing targets in Japan. <a href="XX%20Bomber%20Command">XX Bomber Command</a> was assigned responsibility for this effort and its ground crew began to leave the United States for India by sea in December 1943. The <a href="Twentieth%20Air%20Force">Twentieth Air Force</a> was formed in April 1944 to oversee all B-29 operations. In an unprecedented move, the commander of the USAAF, General <a href="Henry%20H.%20Arnold">Henry H. Arnold</a>, took personal command of this unit and ran it from <a href="the%20Pentagon">the Pentagon</a>. The 58th Bombardment Wing was XX Bomber Command's main combat unit, and its movement from Kansas to India took place from April to mid-May. While the wing had not completed training at the time it left for India, its combat groups were more experienced than most newly deployed USAAF bomber units.

After establishing itself in India, XX Bomber Command under the command of Brigadier General <a href="Kenneth%20Wolfe">Kenneth Wolfe</a> undertook various tasks to prepare for raids against Japan. Foremost among these was stockpiling fuel at the airfields in China. Until late 1944, USAAF <a href="Air%20Transport%20Command%20%28United%20States%20Air%20Force%29">Air Transport Command</a> aircraft did not transport fuel for XX Bomber Command, and this task was instead undertaken by the B-29s. This arrangement proved inefficient, however, as 12 B-29 sorties between India and China were needed to transport enough fuel and other supplies to enable one of the heavy bombers to fly a round trip between China and Japan. As a result, it took longer than expected to build up sufficient stockpiles in China to allow B-29 operations to commence. Moreover, continued technical problems with the Superfortress, and particularly their <a href="Wright%20R-3350">Wright R-3350</a> engines, resulted in many of XX Bomber Command's aircraft being unserviceable and in need of modification at all times.

XX Bomber Command conducted its first combat operation on 5 June 1944. On this day 98 B-29s were dispatched from bases in India to attack targets in <a href="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>, Thailand, as a 'dress rehearsal' for more ambitious operations against Japan and targets in South East Asia. Although little damage was done and five B-29s were lost due to flying accidents and technical faults, the operation was rated a success by XX Bomber Command as it provided useful combat experience for the bomber crews as well as data on how the B-29 performed in action.

On 6 June, Wolfe received a message from Arnold informing him that the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted a raid to be conducted against Japan as soon as possible. The goals of this operation were to relieve pressure on Chinese forces which were being attacked by the Japanese and to support the <a href="Battle%20of%20Saipan">invasion of Saipan</a>. Arnold's message also asked how many B-29s could be dispatched on 15 and 20 June. At the time, the first raid on Japan was tentatively scheduled for 23 June, when sufficient supplies were expected to be available in China to support 100 B-29 sorties. Wolfe replied stating that 50 B-29s could be used on 15 June and 55 if the operation was conducted on the 20th of the month. Arnold regarded these numbers as too low and directed that a raid by at least 70 B-29s be conducted against Japan on 15 June. Following this order, XX Bomber Command's B-29s and transport aircraft embarked on an intensive effort to move fuel to China. Further fuel supplies were made available to the heavy bombers by reducing the activities of USAAF fighter units based in China. During the same period, the command's ground crews reconditioned as many B-29s as possible to improve their reliability.

The target selected for the first raid on Japan was the <a href="Yawata%20Steel%20Works">Imperial Iron and Steel Works</a> at Yawata, an industrial city about from Chengdu. This was the single most important facility in Japan's steel industry as it produced 24 percent of the country's total output of <a href="Rolling%20%28metalworking%29">rolled</a> steel. The facility was dependent on three <a href="Coke%20%28fuel%29">coke</a> plants and the largest of these was selected as the designated aiming point for the B-29s. Nearby Laoyao harbor, which was an important industrial port, was designated as the raid's secondary target. The selection of Yawata's steelworks as the first target to be attacked was in accordance with a decision made by the Twentieth Air Force on 1 April 1944 which assigned the highest priority to attacking Japan's steel and coke industry. It was decided to conduct the raid at night with each B-29 bombing individually as the aircraft lacked the range needed to conduct a more fuel-intensive formation flight between the forward air bases and Yawata.

Despite an elaborate deception plan, which included planted news stories claiming that B-29s would be deployed as bombers in Europe but only be used as armed transports in the <a href="China%20Burma%20India%20Theater%20of%20World%20War%20II">China Burma India Theater</a>, the Japanese military detected the preparation of B-29 bases in India and China. Moreover, Japanese agents in China reported on all B-29 movements, giving hours of warning time before raids on the home islands. Japanese intelligence services deduced that once logistical preparations were complete the heavy bombers would attack factories in northern Kyūshū and that the first raid would be made at night. On 26 April Japanese fighters encountered a B-29 for the first time when two <a href="Nakajima%20Ki-43">Nakajima Ki-43</a> "Oscars" attacked and damaged a lone B-29 flying near the China–India border.

The Japanese military began transferring fighter aircraft from China and the Pacific to the home islands in early 1944 in anticipation of B-29 raids. In June 1944 Yawata lay within the Western District of Japan's four regional defense commands. The 19th Air Brigade was formed in June 1944 to command fighter units in the Western District and comprised the 4th and 59th Air Regiments. The 4th Air Regiment was stationed at <a href="Ozuki%20Air%20Field">Ozuki Airfield</a> and was equipped with 35 <a href="Kawasaki%20Ki-45">Kawasaki Ki-45 Toryu</a> twin-engined heavy fighters, of which 25 were operational in mid-June, and had the brigade's best-trained pilots. The inexperienced 59th Air Regiment was based at <a href="Ashiya%20Air%20Field">Ashiya Fukuoka Airfield</a> and operated 25 <a href="Kawasaki%20Ki-61">Kawasaki Ki-61 Hien</a> single-engined fighters, though only about seven or eight were operational. In addition, Yawata and northern Kyūshū were defended by anti-aircraft artillery units and <a href="barrage%20balloon">barrage balloon</a>s. Radar stations and a network of lookout posts provided early warning of raids.

The 19th Air Brigade's primary mission was to defend the industrial facilities in northern Kyūshū, and particularly the iron works at Yawata. The brigade's plans for the defense of the Western District called for its interceptor aircraft to be concentrated over Yawata and not move far from the area. While this inflexible deployment was considered unsatisfactory by the 19th Air Brigade, it was deemed necessary as few aircraft were available, the only <a href="searchlight">searchlight</a> units needed to facilitate night operations were stationed near Yawata and northern Kyūshū was regarded by the Army as being the most important region in the Western District. Prior to the raid on Yawata the 19th Air Brigade undertook joint planning with anti-aircraft units and implemented a training program which included practice in responding to alerts and night flying.

The 58th Bombardment Wing's B-29s began moving from India to the forward bases in China on 13 June. By 15 June, 83 Superfortresses had reached the four forward airfields around Chengdu, though at least 12 turned back before reaching China and another crashed causing the death of its entire crew. Each of the aircraft had departed India carrying the of 500-pound bombs they would use in the raid. A large number of staff officers, including eight generals, also traveled to Chengdu to observe the operation but were not allowed to participate in the raid. The bomber crews were joined by eight journalists and three news photographers, however. At the time the USAAF had few recent photos of Japanese industrial areas and the bomber crews were briefed on Yawata using maps and photos from the late 1920s and early 1930s.

The Superfortresses began to depart their bases at 16:16 local time on 15 June. The raiding force was led by the 58th Bombardment Wing's commander, Brigadier General Laverne G. Saunders. Of the 75 aircraft dispatched one crashed immediately after taking off with no casualties and a further four turned back suffering mechanical problems. The remaining aircraft proceeded on a direct course to Okino Island where they turned for the run-in to Yawata. Each of the 58th Bombardment Wing's four groups sent two aircraft ahead to mark the target and the other aircraft flew in a long <a href="bomber%20stream">bomber stream</a>; both of these tactics had been adopted from those used by the British Royal Air Force's <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">Bomber Command</a> in Europe. The raiders were detected by Japanese Army and Army Air Force units in China. These reports were passed onto the 19th Air Brigade, which estimated that the bombers were bound for northern Kyūshū and would arrive there at about midnight local time. A radar station and lookout posts on <a href="Jeju-do">Cheju-Do</a> subsequently detected the bombers from 23:31 to 00:30 local time. An air raid alarm was issued at 00:24 and 24 aircraft of the 4th Air Regiment began to take off three minutes later to patrol over northern Kyūshū. The 59th Air Regiment was not <a href="Scrambling%20%28military%29">scrambled</a> as its pilots had not worked with those of the 4th Air Regiment in night operations, its aircraft were suffering from mechanical problems and it was feared that the B-29s would sight and attack the base at Ashiya.

B-29s began to arrive over Yawata at 00:38 local time and the attack on the city lasted almost two hours. Only 15 of the American aircraft were able to aim their bombs visually as the city was <a href="Blackout%20%28wartime%29">blacked out</a> and obscured by smoke or haze; the other 32 bombed by radar. Two further B-29s bombed Laoyao harbor and another five struck targets of opportunity; overall 107 tons of bombs were dropped during the raid. After the first bombs were released regular updates on the operation were transmitted to the Twentieth Air Force's headquarters in Washington, from where they were relayed to Arnold who was in <a href="London">London</a> at the time. The raiders were met with heavy but inaccurate anti-aircraft fire and the searchlights stationed around Yawata were not effective. The 4th Air Regiment achieved the only kill of the night when one of its fighters shot down a B-29. The Regiment's other aircraft struggled to make contact with the bombers and achieved few interceptions.

The B-29s' return flight to China was largely uneventful. One of the Superfortresses was <a href="Strafing">strafed</a> and destroyed by Japanese aircraft after landing at Neihsiang with engine trouble and a further two aircraft crashed with the loss of their entire crews and a correspondent from the magazine "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>". Overall American losses in the raid were seven B-29s destroyed and a further six damaged by anti-aircraft guns; 57 airmen and one journalist were killed aboard these aircraft. Many of the B-29s were stranded in China for several days after the raid due to fuel shortages there, and only returned to India after Wolfe borrowed of fuel from the <a href="312th%20Fighter%20Wing%20%28World%20War%20II%29">312th Fighter Wing's</a> supplies. During this period the bombers were highly vulnerable to Japanese retaliatory raids, but none came about.

Little damage was caused by the raid on Yawata. On 18 June a USAAF <a href="Fourteenth%20Air%20Force">Fourteenth Air Force</a> aircraft overflew the city and photographed the target area. These photos showed that only a single bomb had landed within the Imperial Iron and Steel Works complex, and it had hit a powerhouse from the nearest coke oven. Light damage had also been inflicted on <a href="Kokura%20Arsenal">Kokura Arsenal</a> and other industrial and civilian buildings in the area. Despite a USAAF policy of encouraging factual reportage of B-29 operations, the raid's results were overstated in the U.S. media. The light combat losses suffered by the raiders and <a href="Signals%20intelligence">electronic intelligence</a> collected by the B-29s revealed the ineffectiveness of Japanese radar and air defenses. As a result, the USAAF dispatched a single photo reconnaissance B-29 to overfly much of Japan and Korea on 21 June. This sortie was successful, and greatly improved U.S. intelligence holdings on these areas.

The Yawata raid revealed serious shortcomings in Japan's air defenses. While the 19th Air Brigade initially claimed to have shot down eight B-29s and damaged a further four, it was soon determined that only two of the bombers had been destroyed. This loss ratio was considered too low to defeat attacks on the home islands. The raid demonstrated that Japan had too few air bases and not enough aircraft were available for night operations. It was also found that the Toryu fighter was not well suited to intercepting B-29s as it was slower than the bombers, too lightly armed and most aircraft lacked radar. While the air raid alert system had proved successful in this instance, the radars which detected the American aircraft had been unable to determine their altitude and it was decided that there was a need to further expand radar coverage. The performance of the 131st Anti Aircraft Regiment during the raid was judged to be so poor that its commander was transferred to <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a>. News reports of the Yawata raid and successful U.S. landing at Saipan on the same day also indicated to Japanese civilians that the war was not going well. In response to the raid Japanese Government ministers urged families living the country's four major cities to <a href="Evacuations%20of%20civilians%20in%20Japan%20during%20World%20War%20II">evacuate their children</a> to rural areas.

The 15/16 June 1944 raid on Yawata marked the beginning of the USAAF's strategic bombing campaign against Japan. The city was struck again by B-29s during daylight and night raids on 20 August, but no serious damage was caused. XX Bomber Command conducted 49 raids from its bases in China and India between June 1944 and March 1945, of which nine were made on targets in the Japanese home islands, but Operation Matterhorn did not achieve its goals. Despite initial problems, <a href="XXI%20Bomber%20Command">XXI Bomber Command</a>'s operations from the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Mariana Islands</a>, which began on 28 October 1944, proved much more effective. As a result, XX Bomber Command was transferred to the Mariana Islands in early 1945. Yawata was targeted again by B-29s on 8 August 1945, two days after the <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombing of Hiroshima</a>. On this day the city was attacked by 221 B-29s escorted by three groups of <a href="P-47N%20Thunderbolt">P-47N Thunderbolt</a> fighters including the 318th fighter group based on Ie Shima off the coast of Okinawa. The bombers were armed with <a href="Incendiary%20device">incendiary bombs</a> and the resulting firestorm destroyed 21 percent of Yawata's urban area.

Waddesdon Road railway station

Waddesdon Road railway station, called Waddesdon railway station before 1922, was a small <a href="Train%20station%23Halt">halt</a> in open countryside in <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>, England. It was opened in 1871 as part of a short <a href="Horsecar">horse-drawn</a> <a href="Tramway%20%28industrial%29">tramway</a> to assist with the transport of goods from and around the <a href="Richard%20Temple-Grenville%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Chandos">Duke of Buckingham</a>'s extensive estates in Buckinghamshire and to connect the Duke's estates to the <a href="Aylesbury%20and%20Buckingham%20Railway">Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway</a> at <a href="Quainton%20Road%20railway%20station">Quainton Road</a>. In 1872 the line was expanded and converted for passenger use, becoming known as the <a href="Brill%20Tramway">Brill Tramway</a>. In 1899 the operation of the line was taken over by the London-based <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway">Metropolitan Railway</a>.

In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway was taken into public ownership to become the <a href="Metropolitan%20line">Metropolitan line</a> of the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>, and despite its rural setting Waddesdon Road station became a part of the <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Transport</a> system. The new management could not see a future for the line as a financially viable passenger route, and Waddesdon Road, along with the rest of the former Brill Tramway, was closed in late 1935.

The station was heavily used for the transport of construction materials during the building of <a href="Ferdinand%20James%20von%20Rothschild">Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild</a>'s estate at <a href="Waddesdon%20Manor">Waddesdon Manor</a> in the 1870s and 1880s, but aside from that it saw little use. The station was inconveniently sited and served by few passenger trains, and other more frequently served stations were in easy walking distance. In 1932, the last full year of operations prior to the Metropolitan Railway being taken into public ownership, the station was used for only 281 passenger journeys and generated just £4 of passenger revenue.

On 23 September 1868 the small <a href="Aylesbury%20and%20Buckingham%20Railway">Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway</a> (A&BR) was opened. It ran south from the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway">London and North Western Railway</a>'s <a href="Varsity%20Line">Oxford to Bletchley line</a> at <a href="Verney%20Junction%20railway%20station">Verney Junction</a>, via <a href="Quainton%20Road%20railway%20station">Quainton Road railway station</a>, to connect with the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a> at <a href="Aylesbury%20railway%20station">Aylesbury</a>.
<a href="Richard%20Plantagenet%20Campbell%20Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Chandos">The 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos</a> served as Chairman of the London and North Western Railway from 1852 to 1861 and had a long interest in railways. In the early 1870s he decided to build a <a href="light%20railway">light railway</a> to carry goods between his estates in Buckinghamshire and the A&BR's line at Quainton Road. The first stage of the line, known as the <a href="Brill%20Tramway">Wotton Tramway</a>, was a line from Quainton Road via <a href="Wotton%20%28Metropolitan%20Railway%29%20railway%20station">Wotton</a> to a coal siding at <a href="Kingswood%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Kingswood</a>, and opened on 1 April 1871. Intended for use by <a href="Horsecar">horse trams</a>, the line was built with <a href="Baulk%20road">longitudinal sleepers</a> to avoid horses tripping on the sleepers.

Lobbying from residents and businesses in the nearby town of <a href="Brill%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Brill</a> led to an extension being built in 1872 from Wotton to <a href="Brill%20railway%20station">Brill railway station</a>, at the foot of Brill Hill three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km) from the hilltop town of Brill itself. Two <a href="mixed%20train">mixed train</a>s each day were introduced in each direction, and the line was renamed the Brill Tramway. The Duke bought two <a href="Aveling%20and%20Porter">Aveling and Porter</a> <a href="traction%20engine">traction engine</a>s modified to work as locomotives for the line, each with a top speed of , although a speed limit of was enforced.

The Duke died in 1889, and in 1894 the <a href="trustee">trustee</a>s of his <a href="estate%20%28law%29">estate</a> set up the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O&ATC) with the intention of extending the line from Brill to <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>. On 1 September 1894 London's <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway">Metropolitan Railway</a> (MR) reached Aylesbury, and shortly afterwards connected to the A&BR line, with local MR services running via Quainton Road to Verney Junction from 1 April 1894. Through trains from the MR's London terminus at <a href="Baker%20Street%20tube%20station">Baker Street</a> commenced on 1 January 1897. From 1 December 1899 the MR leased the Brill Tramway from the O&ATC and took over the operation of services on the line, although the Tramway continued to be owned by the O&ATC.

Waddesdon Road was the first station out from the Quainton Road <a href="junction%20station">junction station</a>, in open countryside immediately north of <a href="Akeman%20Street">Akeman Street</a> (the <a href="A41%20road">A41 road</a> after 1919), about southeast of Quainton Road, northwest of the town of <a href="Waddesdon">Waddesdon</a>, and from <a href="Waddesdon%20Manor">Waddesdon Manor</a>. The station was initially built with a single low wooden platform, primarily intended for loading and unloading freight. After the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the MR introduced a single <a href="Brown%2C%20Marshalls%20and%20Co.%20Ltd.">Brown Marshall</a> passenger carriage on the line; at this time, a short section of platform was raised to conventional height to allow access to the higher doors on the new carriage.
Initially known as "Waddesdon Road Siding", the station was renamed "Waddesdon" shortly after opening. On 1 October 1922 the nearby <a href="Waddesdon%20railway%20station">Waddesdon Manor railway station</a>, on the Metropolitan Railway southeast of Quainton Road, was renamed "Waddesdon" and the former Waddesdon station was renamed "Waddesdon Road" in an effort to reduce confusion.

The station was heavily used during the construction of <a href="Baron%20Ferdinand%20de%20Rothschild">Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild</a>'s estate at Waddesdon Manor in the 1870s and 1880s. The <a href="brickworks">brickworks</a> at Brill sent 25,000 bricks per week along the Brill Tramway, and 7,000 <a href="long%20ton">tons</a> (7,100 t) of <a href="Bath%20Stone">Bath Stone</a> were shipped from <a href="Corsham">Corsham</a>. Aside from goods traffic associated with the building of Waddesdon Manor, the station was little used other than for shipping milk from nearby farms to Aylesbury and London. Inconveniently sited away from any nearby towns and villages, and with the far more frequently served Quainton Road and Waddesdon Manor stations within easy walking distance, the station saw very little passenger use. In 1932, the last year of private operation, Waddesdon Road station saw only 281 passengers and made only £4 (about £ in 2019) in passenger receipts over the entire year.
Limited by poor quality locomotives and bumpy, cheaply laid track which followed the contours of the hills, trains ran very slowly in the area: in 1882 trains took 13 minutes to travel the short distance from Waddesdon Road to Quainton Road, and 57 minutes from Waddesdon Road to Brill. From 1872 to 1894 the station was served by two passenger trains per day in each direction, and between 1895 and 1899 the number was increased to three per day. Following the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day in each direction until closure in 1935. Improvements to the line carried out at the time of the transfer to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad, and the improved locomotives of the Metropolitan Railway, reduced journey times from Waddesdon Road to Quainton Road and Brill to 6 minutes and 22 minutes respectively.

On 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan Railway, and all of London's other underground railways except the small <a href="Waterloo%20%26amp%3B%20City%20Railway">Waterloo & City Railway</a>, were taken into public ownership as part of the newly formed <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Passenger Transport Board</a> (LPTB). As a consequence, despite its distance from London, Waddesdon Road station became part of the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> network.
By this time the Brill Tramway was losing significant sums of money. Goods traffic had dwindled, and unlike other areas served by the former Metropolitan Railway there had not been a growth in population and thus passenger numbers remained low. <a href="Frank%20Pick">Frank Pick</a>, Managing Director of the <a href="Underground%20Electric%20Railways%20Company%20of%20London">Underground Group</a> from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, planned to move the new London Underground away from goods services to concentrate solely on serving passengers. He saw the lines beyond Aylesbury to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes, concluding that over £2,000 (about £ in 2019) would be saved by closing the Brill Tramway. As a result, the LPTB decided to abandon all passenger services beyond Aylesbury.

The Brill Tramway was closed on 1 December 1935, with the last trains running on 30 November. Upon the withdrawal of London Transport services the railway and stations reverted to the control of the by now almost dormant Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company. With no funds and no rolling stock of its own the O&ATC was unable to operate the line, and on 2 April 1936 the entire infrastructure of the line was sold at auction; the most expensive lot sold was the platform of Waddesdon Road station, which fetched £7 10s (about £ in 2019). Excluding the station houses at Westcott and Brill, which were sold separately, the auction raised £112 10s (about £ in 2019) in total. No trace of the buildings at Waddesdon Road remains, but the former trackbed is now a public footpath known as the Tramway Walk.

Metropolitan line passenger trains ceased to run north of Aylesbury from 6 July 1936. <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a> services (<a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a> from 1948) continued to run from London's <a href="Marylebone%20station">Marylebone station</a> over the line to Verney Junction via Quainton Road until March 1963, and the LPTB continued to maintain and to operate freight services over the Verney Junction line until 6 September 1947. After the withdrawal of services from London, Verney Junction station remained open to serve trains on the Oxford–Bletchley line. It was closed following the withdrawal of services between Oxford and Cambridge from 1 January 1968.

These <a href="subglacial%20eruption">subglacial eruption</a>s formed <a href="tuya">steep, flat-topped volcanoes</a> and subglacial <a href="lava%20dome">lava dome</a>s, most of which have been entirely exposed by deglaciation. However, at least two volcanoes predate the last glacial period and both are highly eroded. The field gets its name from <a href="Mount%20Cayley">Mount Cayley</a>, the largest and most persistent volcano, located at the southern end of the <a href="Powder%20Mountain%20Icefield">Powder Mountain Icefield</a>. This icefield covers much of the central portion of the <a href="volcanic%20field">volcanic field</a> and is one of the several glacial fields in the <a href="Pacific%20Ranges">Pacific Ranges</a> of the <a href="Coast%20Mountains">Coast Mountains</a>.

Eruptions along the length of the field began between 1.6 and 5.3 million years ago. At least 23 eruptions have occurred throughout its eruptive history. This volcanic activity ranged from <a href="effusive%20eruption">effusive</a> to <a href="explosive%20eruption">explosive</a>, with magma compositions ranging from <a href="basalt">basalt</a>ic to <a href="rhyolite">rhyolitic</a>. Because the Mount Cayley volcanic field has a high <a href="elevation">elevation</a> and consists of a cluster of mostly high altitude, non-overlapping volcanoes, subglacial activity is likely to have occurred under less than of glacial ice. The style of this glaciation promoted <a href="meltwater">meltwater</a> escape during eruptions. The steep profile of the volcanic field and its subglacial landforms support this hypothesis. As a result, volcanic features in the field that interacted with glacial ice lack rocks that display evidence of abundant water during eruption, such as <a href="hyaloclastite">hyaloclastite</a> and <a href="pillow%20lava">pillow lava</a>.

Of the entire volcanic field, the southern portion has the most known volcanoes. Here, at least 11 of them are situated on top of a long narrow mountain ridge and in adjacent <a href="river%20valley">river valley</a>s. The central portion contains at least five volcanoes situated at the Powder Mountain Icefield. To the north, two volcanoes form a sparse area of volcanism. Many of these volcanoes were formed between 0.01 and 1.6 million years ago, some of which show evidence of volcanic activity in the last 10,000 years.

The Mount Cayley volcanic field formed as a result of the ongoing <a href="subduction">subduction</a> of the <a href="Juan%20de%20Fuca%20Plate">Juan de Fuca Plate</a> under the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American Plate</a> at the Cascadia subduction zone along the British Columbia Coast. This is a long <a href="fault%20zone">fault zone</a> running off the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> from <a href="Northern%20California">Northern California</a> to southwestern British Columbia. The plates move at a relative rate of over per year at an oblique angle to the subduction zone. Because of the very large fault area, the Cascadia subduction zone can produce large <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a>s of <a href="magnitude%20%28mathematics%29">magnitude</a> 7.0 or greater. The interface between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates remains locked for periods of roughly 500 years. During these periods, stress builds up on the interface between the plates and causes uplift of the North American margin. When the plate finally slips, the 500 years of stored energy are released in a massive earthquake.

Unlike most subduction zones worldwide, there is no deep <a href="oceanic%20trench">oceanic trench</a> present along the <a href="continental%20margin">continental margin</a> in Cascadia. The reason is that the mouth of the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> empties directly into the subduction zone and deposits silt at the bottom of the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, burying this large <a href="depression%20%28geology%29">depression</a>. Massive floods from prehistoric <a href="Glacial%20Lake%20Missoula">Glacial Lake Missoula</a> during the <a href="Late%20Pleistocene">Late Pleistocene</a> also deposited large amounts of <a href="sediment">sediment</a> into the trench. However, in common with other subduction zones, the outer margin is slowly being compressed, similar to a giant spring. When the stored energy is suddenly released by slippage across the fault at irregular intervals, the Cascadia subduction zone can create very large earthquakes, such as the magnitude 9.0 <a href="1700%20Cascadia%20earthquake">Cascadia earthquake on January 26, 1700</a>. However, earthquakes along the Cascadia subduction zone are less common than expected and there is evidence of a decline in volcanic activity over the last few million years. The probable explanation lies in the rate of convergence between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates. These two tectonic plates currently converge to per year. This is only about half the rate of convergence from seven million years ago.

Scientists have estimated that there have been at least 13 significant earthquakes along the Cascadia subduction zone in the last 6,000 years. The most recent, the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, was recorded in the oral traditions of the <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a> people on <a href="Vancouver%20Island">Vancouver Island</a>. It caused considerable tremors and a massive <a href="tsunami">tsunami</a> that traveled across the Pacific Ocean. The significant shaking associated with this earthquake demolished houses of the <a href="Cowichan%20Tribes">Cowichan Tribes</a> on Vancouver Island and caused several <a href="landslide">landslide</a>s. Shaking due to this earthquake made it too difficult for the Cowichan people to stand, and the tremors were so lengthy that they were sickened. The tsunami created by the earthquake ultimately devastated a winter village at Pachena Bay, killing all the people that lived there. The 1700 Cascadia earthquake caused near-shore subsidence, submerging <a href="marsh">marsh</a>es and forests on the coast that were later buried under more recent debris.

Lying in the middle of the Mount Cayley volcanic field is a subglacial volcano named <a href="Slag%20Hill">Slag Hill</a>. At least two <a href="geological%20unit">geological unit</a>s compose the edifice. Slag Hill proper consists of <a href="andesite">andesite</a> lava flows and small amounts of <a href="pyroclastic%20rock">pyroclastic rock</a>. Lying on the western portion of Slag Hill is a lava flow that likely erupted less than 10,000 years ago due to the lack of features indicating volcano-ice interactions. The Slag Hill flow-dominated tuya northeast of Slag Hill proper consists of a flat-topped, steep-sided pile of andesite. It protrudes through remnants of volcanic material erupted from Slag Hill proper, but it represents a separate volcanic vent due to its geographical appearance. This small subglacial volcano possibly formed between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago throughout the waning stages of the <a href="Fraser%20glaciation">Fraser Glaciation</a>.

<a href="Cauldron%20Dome">Cauldron Dome</a>, a subglacial volcano north of Mount Cayley, lies west of the Powder Mountain Icefield. Like Slag Hill, it is composed of two geological units. Upper Cauldron Dome is a flat-topped, oval-shaped pile of at least five andesite lava flows that resembles a tuya. The five andesite flows are <a href="joint%20%28geology%29">columnar jointed</a> and were likely extruded through glacial ice. The latest volcanic activity might have occurred between 10,000 and 25,000 years ago when this area was still influenced by glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation. Lower Cauldron Dome, the youngest unit comprising the entire Cauldron Dome subglacial volcano, consists of a flat-topped, steep-sided pile of andesite lava flows long and a maximum thickness of . These volcanics were extruded about 10,000 years ago during the waning stages of the Fraser Glaciation from a vent adjacent to upper Cauldron Dome that is currently buried under glacial ice.
<a href="Ring%20Mountain%20%28British%20Columbia%29">Ring Mountain</a>, a flow-dominated tuya lying at the northern portion of the Mount Cayley volcanic field, consists of a pile of at least five andesite lava flows lying on a mountain ridge. Its steep-sided flanks reach heights of and are composed of volcanic rubble. This makes it impossible to measure its exact base elevation or how many lava flows constitute the edifice. With a summit elevation of , Ring Mountain had its last volcanic activity between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago when the Fraser Glaciation was close to its maximum. Northwest of Ring Mountain lies a minor andesite lava flow. Its chemistry is somewhat unlike other andesite flows comprising Ring Mountain, but it probably erupted from a volcanic vent adjacent to or at Ring Mountain. The part of it that lies higher in elevation contains some features that indicate lava-ice interactions, while the lower-elevation portion of it does not. Therefore, this minor lava flow was likely extruded after Ring Mountain formed but when glacial ice covered a broader area than it does to this day, and that the lava flowed beyond the region in which glacial ice existed at that time.

To the north lies <a href="Little%20Ring%20Mountain">Little Ring Mountain</a>, another flow-dominated tuya lying at the northern portion of the Mount Cayley volcanic field. It consists of a pile of at least three andesite lava flows lying on a mountain ridge. Its steep-sided flanks reach heights of and are composed of volcanic rubble. This makes it impossible to measure its exact base elevation or how many lava flows comprise the edifice. With a summit elevation of , Little Ring Mountain had its last volcanic activity between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago when the Fraser Glaciation was close to its maximum.

<a href="Ember%20Ridge">Ember Ridge</a>, a mountain ridge between <a href="Tricouni%20Peak">Tricouni Peak</a> and Mount Fee, consists of at least eight lava domes composed of andesite. They were likely formed between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago when lava erupted beneath glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation. Their current structures are comparable to their original forms due to the minimal degree of erosion. As a result, the domes display the shapes and columnar joints typical of subglacial volcanoes. The random shapes of the Ember Ridge domes are the result of erupted lava taking advantage of former ice pockets, eruptions taking place on uneven surfaces, subsidence of the domes during volcanic activity to create rubble and separation of older columnar units during more recent eruptions. The northern dome, known as Ember Ridge North, covers the summit and eastern flank of the mountain ridge. It comprises at least one lava flow that reaches a thickness of , as well as the thinnest columnar units in the Mount Cayley volcanic field. The small size of the columnar joints indicates that the erupted lava was cooled immediately and are mainly located on the dome's summit. Ember Ridge Northeast, the smallest subglacial dome of Ember Ridge, comprises one lava flow that has a thickness no more than . Ember Ridge Northwest, the most roughly circular subglacial dome, comprises at least one lava flow. Ember Ridge Southeast is the most complex of the Ember Ridge domes, consisting of a series of lava flows with a thickness of . It is also the only Ember Ridge dome that contains large amounts of rubble. Ember Ridge Southwest comprises at least one lava flow that reaches a thickness of . It is the only subglacial dome of Ember Ridge that contains hyaloclastite. Ember Ridge West comprises only one lava flow that reaches a thickness of .

<a href="Mount%20Brew%20%28Cheakamus%20River%29">Mount Brew</a>, southwest of the <a href="resort%20town">resort town</a> of <a href="Whistler%2C%20British%20Columbia">Whistler</a>, is a high lava dome composed of andesite or dacite that probably formed subglacially between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago. It contains two masses of rock that might resemble <a href="ice-marginal%20lava%20flow">ice-marginal lava flow</a>s. These edifices have not been studied in detail but they could have formed during the same period as the Ember Ridge subglacial domes due to their structures, columnar joints and compositions.

The Mount Cayley <a href="massif">massif</a>, in elevation, is the largest and most persistent volcano in the Mount Cayley volcanic field. It is a highly eroded stratovolcano composed of dacite and <a href="rhyodacite">rhyodacite</a> lava that was deposited during three phases of volcanic activity. The first eruptive phase started about four million years ago with the eruption of dacite lava flows and pyroclastic rock. This resulted in the creation of the Mount Cayley proper. Subsequent volcanism during this volcanic phase constructed a significant lava dome. This acts like a volcanic plug and composes the <a href="lava%20spine">lava spine</a>s that currently form pinnacles on Cayley's rugged summit. After the Mount Cayley proper was constructed, lava flows, <a href="tephra">tephra</a> and welded dacite rubble was erupted. This second phase of activity million years ago resulted in the creation of the <a href="Vulcan%27s%20Thumb">Vulcan's Thumb</a>, a craggy volcanic ridge on the southern flank of the Mount Cayley proper. Lengthy dissection from an extended period of erosion demolished much of the original stratovolcano. Volcanic activity after this prolonged period of erosion produced thick dacite lava flows from <a href="Parasitic%20cone">parasitic vents</a> 300,000 years ago that extended into the <a href="Turbid%20Creek">Turbid</a> and <a href="Shovelnose%20Creek">Shovelnose Creek</a> valleys near the Squamish River. This subsequently created two minor parasitic lava domes 200,000 years ago. These three volcanic events in contrast to several others around Cayley in that they do not show signs of interaction with glacial ice.
Immediately southeast of Mount Cayley lies <a href="Mount%20Fee">Mount Fee</a>, an extensively eroded volcano containing a north-south trending ridge. It has an elevation of and is one of the older volcanic features in the Mount Cayley volcanic field. Its volcanics are undated, but its large amount of dissection and evidence of glacial ice overriding the volcano indicates that it formed more than 75,000 years ago before the <a href="Wisconsinan%20Glaciation">Wisconsinan Glaciation</a>. Therefore, volcanism at Mount Fee does not display evidence of interaction with glacial ice. The remaining products from Fee's earliest volcanic activity is a minor portion of pyroclastic rock. This is evidence of explosive volcanism from Fee's eruptive history, as well as its first volcanic event. The second volcanic event produced a sequence of lavas and breccias on the eastern flank of the main ridge. These volcanics were likely deposited when a sequence of lava flows and broken lava fragments erupted from a volcanic vent and moved down the flanks during the construction of a large volcano. Following extensive dissection, renewed volcanism produced a viscous series of lava flows forming its narrow, flat-topped, steep-sided northern limit and the northern end of the main ridge. The conduit for which these lava flows originated from was likely vertical in structure and intruded through older volcanics deposited during Fee's earlier volcanic events. This volcanic event was also followed by a period of erosion, and likely one or more glacial periods. Extensive erosion following the last volcanic event at Mount Fee has created the rugged north-south trending ridge that currently forms a prominent landmark.

<a href="Pali%20Dome">Pali Dome</a>, located north and northeast of Mount Cayley, is an eroded volcano in the central Mount Cayley volcanic field. Like Cauldron Dome, it consists of two geological units. Pail Dome East is composed of a mass of andesite lava flows and small amounts of pyroclastic material. It lies on the eastern portion of the Powder Mountain Icefield. Much of the lava flows form gentle topography at high elevations but terminate in finely jointed vertical cliffs at low elevations. The first volcanic activity likely occurred about 25,000 years ago, but it could also be significantly older. The most recent volcanic activity produced a series of lava flows that were erupted when the vent area was not covered by glacial ice. However, the flows show evidence of interaction with glacial ice in their lower units. This indicates that the lavas were erupted about 10,000 years ago during the waning stages of the Fraser Glaciation. The ice-marginal lava flows reach thicknesses of up to . Pali Dome West consists of at least three andesite lava flows and small amounts of pyroclastic material; its vent is presently buried under glacial ice. At least three eruptions have occurred at Pali Dome East. The age of the first volcanic eruption is unknown, but it could have occurred in the last 10,000 years. The second eruption produced a lava flow that was erupted when the vent area was not buried under glacial ice. However, the flow does show evidence of interaction with glacial ice at its lower unit. This indicates that the lavas were erupted during the waning stages of the Fraser Glaciation. The third and most recent eruption produced another lava flow that was largely erupted above glacial ice, but was probably constrained on its northern margin by a small glacier. Unlike the lava flow that was erupted during the second eruption, this lava flow was not impounded by glacial ice at its lower unit. This suggests that it erupted less than 10,000 years ago when the regional Fraser Glaciation retreated.

At least two sequences of <a href="basaltic%20andesite">basaltic andesite</a> lava flows are deposited south of <a href="Tricouni%20Peak">Tricouni Peak</a>. One of these sequences, known as <a href="Tricouni%20Southwest">Tricouni Southwest</a>, creates a cliff on the eastern side of a north-south trending channel with a depth of adjacent to the <a href="High%20Falls%20Creek">High Falls Creek</a> mouth. The eastern flank of the lava flow, outside the High Falls Creek channel, has a more constant structure. Several fine-scale columnar joints and the overall structure of the lava flow suggest that its western portion, along the length of the channel, ponded against glacial ice. Near its southern unit, lava oozed into cracks in the glacial ice. This has been identified by the existence of spire-like cooling formations, although many of these edifices have been destroyed by erosional processes. Other features that indicate the lava ponded against glacial ice include its unusually thick structure and its steep cliffs. Therefore, the Tricouni Southwest lava flow was erupted about 10,000 years ago when the regional Fraser Glaciation was retreating. The explanation for the western portion displaying ice-contact features while the eastern portion does not is likely because its western flank lies in a north-south trending channel, which would have been able to maintain smaller amounts of solar heat than its unsheltered eastern flank. As a result, the western portion of the lava flow records glaciation during a period when the eastern slopes were free from glacial ice.

Tricouni Southeast, another volcanic sequence south of Tricouni Peak, consists of at least four andesite or dacite lava flows that outcrop as several small cliffs and bluffs on extensively vegetated flanks. They reach thicknesses of and contain small amounts of hyaloclastite. The feeder of their origins has not been discovered but is likely located at the summit of the mound. These lavas form ice-marginal edifies, suggesting that every lava flow was erupted about 10,000 years ago when the vast Cordilleran Ice Sheet was retreating and remains of glacial ice were sparse.

Exposed along the <a href="Cheakamus%20River">Cheakamus River</a> and its <a href="tributary">tributaries</a> are the <a href="Cheakamus%20Valley%20basalts">Cheakamus Valley basalts</a>. Although not necessarily mapped as part of the Cayley field, this sequence of basaltic lava flows is geologically similar and comparable in age to volcanic features that are part of this volcanic field. At least four basaltic flows comprise the sequence and were deposited during periods of volcanic activity from an unknown vent between 0.01 and 1.6 million years ago. Pillow lava is abundant along the bases the flows, some of which are underlain by hyaloclastite breccia. In 1958, Canadian volcanologist <a href="Bill%20Mathews">Bill Mathews</a> suggested that the lava flows were erupted during periods of subglacial activity and traveled through trenches or tunnels melted in glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation. Mathews based this on the age of the underlying till, the existence of pillow lava close to the bottom of some lavas, indicating subaqueous volcanism, the columnar jointing at the edges of the lavas, indicating rapid cooling, and the absence of apparent <a href="palaeogeography">palaeogeography</a>.

The andesite lava of Ember Ridge comprises 55% brownish-green <a href="volcanic%20glass">volcanic glass</a> with a <a href="trachyte">trachytic</a> <a href="matrix%20%28geology%29">matrix</a> of <a href="plagioclase">plagioclase</a>. About 35% of Ember Ridge andesite contains <a href="phenocryst">phenocryst</a>s of <a href="hornblende">hornblende</a>, <a href="augite">augite</a>, plagioclase and <a href="orthopyroxene">orthopyroxene</a> and exist as isolated crystals and clots. A feature south of Ember Ridge, unofficially known as Betty's Bump, comprises andesite with phenocrysts of plagioclase, augite and <a href="olivine">olivine</a>. Dark brown volcanic glass composes the Betty's Bump andesite as much as 20%. The relationship of Betty's Bump with Ember Ridge is unclear but it likely represents a separate volcanic feature due to its topographic isolation.

Little Ring Mountain at the northern end of the field contains at least 70% brown volcanic glass with isolated phenocrysts of plagioclase. <a href="Vesicular%20texture">Vesicular texture</a>s are up to 5%, suggesting that the lava erupted <a href="subaerial%20eruption">subaerially</a>. Probable <a href="xenocryst">xenocryst</a>s of <a href="quartz">quartz</a> have been identified at the volcano. At least one <a href="xenolith">xenolith</a> fragment has been found in loose rubble at the volcano and included several quartz xenocrysts and <a href="polycrystal">polycrystal</a>line quartz xenoliths in a glassy matrix with trachytic plagioclase.

The dacite volcanics composing Mount Fee contain brown volcanic glass as much as 70% and vesicular textures as much as 15%. About 25% of the volcanics contain crystal content, including plagioclase, hornblende, orthopyroxene, <a href="orthoclase">orthoclase</a> and sporadic quartz. The orthoclase crystals are interpreted to represent rock fragments that became enveloped during hardening of the dacitic lavas. A portion of the southwestern flank of Mount Fee comprises no volcanic glass, but rather composed of an abnormal <a href="cryptocrystalline">cryptocrystalline</a> matrix. This indicates that it might have developed as part of a <a href="subvolcanic%20rock">subvolcanic</a> intrusion.

At Ring Mountain, andesite comprises 70% brown volcanic glass and vesicular textures as much as 15%. The plagioclastic matrix is trachytic. Augite, biotite, plagioclase and hornblende occur as microphenocrysts and comprise 1% to 7% of the andesite. Small qualities of quartz are common and occur as microxenocrysts. Microxenocrysts of orthoclase likely exist in andesite at Ring Mountain.

Andesite at Slag Hill consists of 70% dark brown volcanic glass with varied degrees of trachytic texture in the plagioclastic matrix and less than 5% of the andesite comprises vesicular textures. Plagioclase, hornblende and augite are mostly in form as phenocrysts and comprise 1% to 10% of the andesite. Orthoclase crystals are found occasionally and they likely represent xenocrysts.

At least four seismic events have occurred at Mount Cayley since 1985 and is the only volcano that has recorded seismic activity in the field. This suggests that the volcano still contains an active magma system, indicating the possibility of future eruptive activity. Although the available data does not allow a clear conclusion, this observation indicates that some volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field may be active, with significant potential hazards. This seismic activity correlates both with some of Canada's most youthful volcanoes and with long-lived volcanoes with a history of significant explosive activity, such as Mount Cayley. Recent seismic imaging from <a href="Natural%20Resources%20Canada">Natural Resources Canada</a> employees supported lithoprobe studies in the region of Mount Cayley that created a large reflector interpreted to be a pool of molten rock roughly below the surface. It is estimated to be long and wide with a thickness of less than . The reflector is understood to be a <a href="sill%20%28geology%29">sill</a> complex associated with the formation of Mount Cayley. However, the available data does not rule out the probability of it being a body of molten rock created by dehydrating of the subducted Juan de Fuca Plate. It is located just beneath the weak <a href="lithosphere">lithosphere</a> like those found under subduction zone volcanoes in <a href="Japan">Japan</a>.

At least five <a href="hot%20spring">hot spring</a>s exist in valleys near Mount Cayley, providing more evidence for magmatic activity. This includes springs found at Shovelnose Creek and Turbid Creek on the southern flank of Mount Cayley and <a href="Brandywine%20Creek%20%28British%20Columbia%29">Brandywine Creek</a> on the eastern flank of the volcanic field. They are generally found in areas of volcanic activity that are geologically young. As the regional surface water percolates downward through rocks below the Mount Cayley field, it reaches areas of high temperatures surrounding an active or recently solidified magma reservoir. Here, the water is heated, becomes less dense and rises back to the surface along fissures or cracks. These features are sometimes referred to as "dying volcanoes" because they seem to represent the last stage of volcanic activity as the magma at depth cools and hardens.

Several volcanic features in the Mount Cayley field were illustrated by volcanologist <a href="Jack%20Souther">Jack Souther</a> in 1980, including Mount Cayley, Cauldron Dome, Slag Hill, Mount Fee, Ember Ridge and Ring Mountain, which was titled "Crucible Dome" at the time. This resulted in the creation of a <a href="geologic%20map">geologic map</a> that showed the regional terrain and locations of the volcanoes. The most detailed study of Mount Cayley took place during this period. Little Ring Mountain at the northernmost end of the field had not been studied at the time and was not included on Souther's 1980 map. Ember Ridge at the southern end of the field was originally mapped as a cluster of five lava domes. The sixth lava dome, Ember Ridge Northeast, was discovered by Ph.D. student Melanie Kelman during a period of research in 2001.

The hot springs adjacent to Mount Cayley have made the volcanic field a target for geothermal exploration. At least 16 geothermal sites have been identified in British Columbia, Mount Cayley being one of the six areas most capable for commercial development. Others include <a href="Meager%20Creek">Meager Creek</a> and Pebble Creek near <a href="Pemberton%2C%20British%20Columbia">Pemberton</a>, <a href="Lakelse%20Hot%20Springs">Lakelse Hot Springs</a> near <a href="Terrace%2C%20British%20Columbia">Terrace</a>, <a href="Mount%20Edziza">Mount Edziza</a> on the <a href="Tahltan%20Highland">Tahltan Highland</a> and the Lillooet Fault Zone between <a href="Harrison%20Lake">Harrison Lake</a> and the community of <a href="Lillooet%2C%20British%20Columbia">Lillooet</a>. Temperatures of to more than have been measured in shallow boreholes on the southwestern flank of Mount Cayley. However, its severe terrain makes it challenging to develop a proposed 100 <a href="megawatt">megawatt</a> <a href="power%20station">power station</a> in the area.

The line of volcanoes has been the subject of myths and legends by <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a>. To the <a href="Squamish%20Nation">Squamish Nation</a>, Mount Cayley is called "tak'takmu'yin tl'a in7in'axa7en". In their <a href="Squamish%20language">language</a> it means "Landing Place of the Thunderbird". The <a href="Thunderbird%20%28mythology%29">Thunderbird</a> is a <a href="legendary%20creature">legendary creature</a> in <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">North American indigenous peoples'</a> history and culture. When the bird flaps its wings, thunder is created, and lightning originates from its eyes. The rocks that make up Mount Cayley were said to have been burnt black by the Thunderbird's lightning. This mountain, like others in the area, is considered sacred because it plays an important part of their <a href="S%E1%B8%B5wx%CC%B1w%C3%BA7mesh%20history">history</a>. <a href="The%20Black%20Tusk">The Black Tusk</a>, a pinnacle of black <a href="volcanic%20rock">volcanic rock</a> on the north shore of <a href="Garibaldi%20Lake">Garibaldi Lake</a> to the southeast, sustains the same name. Cultural ceremonial use, hunting, trapping and plant gathering occur around the <a href="Mount%20Garibaldi">Mount Garibaldi</a> area, but the most important resources was a lithic material called <a href="obsidian">obsidian</a>. Obsidian is a black volcanic glass used to make knives, chisels, adzes and other sharp tools in pre-contact times. Glassy rhyodacite was also collected from a number of minor outcrops on the flanks of Mount Fee, <a href="Mount%20Callaghan">Mount Callaghan</a> and Mount Cayley. This material appears in goat hunting sites and at the Elaho rockshelter, collectively dated from about 8,000 to 100 years old.

A number of volcanic peaks in the Mount Cayley field were named by mountaineers that explored the area in the early 20th century. Mount Fee was named in September 1928 by British mountaineer Tom Fyles after Charles Fee (1865–1927), who was a member of the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Mountaineering%20Club">British Columbia Mountaineering Club</a> in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> at the time. To the northwest, Mount Cayley was named in September 1928 by Tom Fyles after Beverley Cochrane Cayley during a climbing expedition with the <a href="Alpine%20Club%20of%20Canada">Alpine Club of Canada</a>. Cayley was a friend of those in the climbing expedition and had died in Vancouver on June 8, 1928 at the age of 29. Photographs of Mount Cayley were taken by Fyles during the 1928 expedition and were published in the 1931 <a href="Canadian%20Alpine%20Journal">Canadian Alpine Journal</a> Vol XX.

At least one feature in the Mount Cayley volcanic field is protected as a <a href="provincial%20park">provincial park</a>. <a href="Brandywine%20Falls%20Provincial%20Park">Brandywine Falls Provincial Park</a> at the southeastern end of the field was established to protect Brandywine Falls, a high waterfall on Brandywine Creek. It is composed of at least four lava flows of the Cheakamus Valley basalts. They are exposed in cliffs compassing the falls with a narrow sequence of gravel lying above the oldest lava unit. These lava flows are interpreted to have been exposed by erosion during a period of catastrophic flooding and the valley these lavas are located in is significantly larger than the river within it. The massive flooding that shaped the valley has been a subject of geological studies by <a href="Catherine%20Hickson">Catherine Hickson</a> and Andree Blais-Stevens. It has been proposed that there could have been significant floods during the waning stages of the last glacial period as drainage in a valley further north was blocked with remnants of glacial ice. Another possible explanation is subglacial eruptions created large amounts of glacial meltwater that scoured the surface of the exposed lava flows.

Like other volcanic zones in the Garibaldi Belt, volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field are not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active their magma systems are. This is partly because the field is located in a remote region and no major eruptions have occurred in Canada in the last few hundred years. As a result, volcano monitoring is less important than dealing with other natural processes, including <a href="tsunami">tsunami</a>s, earthquakes and landslides. However, with the existence of earthquakes, further volcanism is expected and would probably have considerable effects, particularly in a region like southwestern British Columbia where the Garibaldi Belt is located in a highly populated area. Because of these concerns, significant support from Canadian university scientists have resulted in the construction of a baseline of knowledge on the state of the Garibaldi volcanoes. This improvement is continuous and will support the understanding to monitor volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field for future volcanism.

The Mount Cayley field is one of the largest volcanic zones in the Garibaldi Belt. Smaller zones include the <a href="Garibaldi%20Lake%20volcanic%20field">Garibaldi Lake volcanic field</a> surrounding Garibaldi Lake and the <a href="Bridge%20River%20Cones">Bridge River Cones</a> on the northern flank of the upper <a href="Bridge%20River">Bridge River</a>. These areas are adjacent to Canada's populated southwest corner where the population of British Columbia is the greatest.

A large volcanic eruption from any volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field would have major effects on the <a href="Sea-to-Sky%20Highway">Sea-to-Sky Highway</a> and municipalities such as <a href="Squamish%2C%20British%20Columbia">Squamish</a>, Whistler, Pemberton and probably Vancouver. Because of these concerns, the Geological Survey of Canada is planning to create <a href="hazard%20map">hazard map</a>s and emergency plans for Mount Cayley, as well as for the <a href="Mount%20Meager%20massif">Mount Meager massif</a> north of the volcanic field, which experienced a major volcanic eruption 2,350 years ago similar to the <a href="1980%20eruption%20of%20Mount%20St.%20Helens">1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens</a>.

Like many other volcanoes in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, Mount Cayley has been the source for several large landslides. To date, most geological studies of the Mount Cayley field have focused on landslide hazards along with geothermal potential. A major debris avalanche about 4,800 years ago dumped of volcanic material into the adjacent Squamish valley. This blocked the <a href="Squamish%20River">Squamish River</a> for a long period of time. Evans (1990) has indicated that a number of landslides and <a href="debris%20flow">debris flow</a>s at Mount Cayley in the last 10,000 years might have been caused by volcanic activity. Since the large debris avalanche 4,800 years ago, a number of more minor landslides have occurred at it, including one 1,100 years ago and another event 500 years ago. Both landslides ultimately blocked the Squamish River and created lakes upstream that lasted for a limited amount of time. In 1968 and 1983, a series of landslides took place that caused considerable damage to logging roads and forest stands, but did not result in any casualties. Future landslides from Mount Cayley and potential damming of the Squamish River are significant geological hazards to the general public, as well as to the economic development in the Squamish valley.

Eruptive activity in the Mount Cayley volcanic field is typical of past volcanism elsewhere in the Garibaldi Belt. Large earthquakes would occur under the volcanic field weeks to years in advance as molten rock intrudes through the Earth's rocky <a href="lithosphere">lithosphere</a>. The extent of earthquakes and the local seismographs in this region would warn the Geological Survey of Canada and possibly cause an upgrade in monitoring. While molten rock breaks through the crust, the size of the volcano vulnerable to an eruption would probably swell and the area would rupture, creating much more hydrothermal activity at the regional hot springs and the formation of new springs or <a href="fumarole">fumarole</a>s. Small and probably significant rock avalanches may result and could dam the nearby Squamish River for a limited amount of time, such as those that occurred in the past without seismic activity and deformation related to magmatic activity. At some point the subsurface magma will produce <a href="phreatic%20eruption">phreatic eruption</a>s and <a href="lahar">lahar</a>s. At this time Highway 99 would be out of service and the residents of Squamish would have to travel away from the eruptive zone.
While molten rock comes closer to the surface it would most likely cause more fragmentation, triggering an explosive eruption that could produce an eruption column with an elevation of and may be sustained for 12 hours. A well-documented explosive eruption in the Garibaldi Belt with such force is the eruption of the Mount Meager massif 2,350 years ago, which deposed ash as far east as <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>. This would endanger air traffic and would have to take another route away from the eruptive zone. Every airport buried under <a href="pyroclastic%20fall">pyroclastic fall</a> would be out of service, including those in Vancouver, <a href="Victoria%2C%20British%20Columbia">Victoria</a>, <a href="Kamloops">Kamloops</a>, <a href="Prince%20George%2C%20British%20Columbia">Prince George</a> and <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>. The tephra would destroy <a href="power%20transmission%20lines">power transmission lines</a>, <a href="satellite%20dish">satellite dish</a>es, computers and other equipment that operates on electricity. Therefore, telephones, radios and <a href="cell%20phone">cell phone</a>s would be disconnected. Structures not built for holding heavy material would likely demolish under the weight of the tephra. Ash from the eruption plume would subside above the vent area to create pyroclastic flows and would travel east and west down the nearby <a href="Cheakamus%20River">Cheakamus</a> and Squamish river valleys. These would likely have significant impacts on salmon in the associated rivers and would cause considerable melting of glacial ice to produce debris flows that may extend into <a href="Daisy%20Lake%20%28British%20Columbia%29">Daisy Lake</a> and Squamish to cause significant damage. The eruption column would then travel eastward and extract air travel throughout Canada from Alberta to <a href="Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Newfoundland and Labrador</a>.

Explosive eruptions may decrease and be followed by the eruption of viscous lava to form a lava dome in the newly formed crater. <a href="Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">Precipitation</a> would frequently trigger lahars and these would continuously create problems in the Squamish and Cheakamus river valleys. If the lava dome continues to grow, it would eventually rise above the crater rim. The lava would be cooling and expanding then may produce landslides to create a massive zone of blocky talus in the Squamish river valley. While the dome of lava grows, it would frequently subside to create large pyroclastic flows that would again travel down the adjacent Squamish and Cheakamus river valleys. Tephra swept away from the pyroclastic flows would create ash columns with elevations of at least , repeatedly depositing tephra on the communities of Whistler and Pemberton and again disrupting regional air traffic. Lava of the unstable dome may occasionally create minor pyroclastic flows, explosions and eruption columns. The community of Squamish would be abandoned, Highway 99 would be out of service and destroyed, and traffic adjacent to Vancouver, Pemberton and Whistler would remain forced to travel along a route to the east that is more lengthy than Highway 99.

Eruptions would likely continue for a period of time, followed by years of decreasing secondary activity. The solidifying lava would occasionally collapse portions of the volcano to create pyroclastic flows. Rubble on the flanks of the volcano and in valleys would occasionally be released to form debris flows. Major construction would be needed to repair the community of Squamish and Highway 99.

1899 Kentucky gubernatorial election

The Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899 was held on November 7, 1899, to choose the 33rd <a href="governor%20of%20Kentucky">governor of Kentucky</a>. The incumbent, <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="William%20O%27Connell%20Bradley">William O'Connell Bradley</a>, was <a href="Term%20limits%20in%20the%20United%20States">term-limited</a> and unable to seek re-election.

After a contentious and chaotic nominating convention at the Music Hall in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a>, the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> chose <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">state Senator</a> <a href="William%20Goebel">William Goebel</a> as its nominee. A dissident faction of the party, styling themselves the "Honest Election Democrats", were angered by Goebel's political tactics at the Music Hall convention and later held their own nominating convention. They chose former governor <a href="John%20Y.%20Brown%20%281835%E2%80%931904%29">John Y. Brown</a> as their nominee. Republicans nominated <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Kentucky">state Attorney General</a> <a href="William%20S.%20Taylor">William S. Taylor</a>, although Governor Bradley favored another candidate and lent Taylor little support in the ensuing campaign. In the general election, Taylor won by a vote of 193,714 to 191,331. Brown garnered 12,040 votes, more than the difference between Taylor and Goebel. The election results were challenged on grounds of <a href="voter%20fraud">voter fraud</a>, but surprisingly, the state Board of Elections, created by a law Goebel had sponsored and stocked with pro-Goebel commissioners, certified Taylor's victory.

An incensed Democratic majority in the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a> created a committee to investigate the charges of voter fraud, even as armed citizens from heavily Republican eastern Kentucky poured into the state capital under auspices of keeping Democrats from stealing the election. Before the investigative committee could report, Goebel was shot by an unknown assassin while entering the <a href="Old%20State%20Capitol%20%28Kentucky%29">state capitol</a> on January 30, 1900. As Goebel lay in a nearby hotel being treated for his wounds, the committee issued its report recommending that the General Assembly invalidate enough votes to give the election to Goebel. The report was accepted, Taylor was deposed, and Goebel was sworn into office on January 31. He died three days later on February 2.

<a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Lieutenant Governor</a> <a href="J.%20C.%20W.%20Beckham">J. C. W. Beckham</a> ascended to the office of governor, and he and Taylor waged a protracted court battle over the governorship. Beckham won <a href="Taylor%20v.%20Beckham">the case</a> on appeal, and Taylor fled to <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> to escape prosecution as an accomplice in Goebel's murder. A total of sixteen people were charged in connection with the assassination. Five went to trial; two of those were acquitted. Each of the remaining three were convicted in trials fraught with irregularities and were eventually pardoned by subsequent governors. The identity of Goebel's assassin remains a mystery.

In the <a href="Kentucky%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%201895">1895 gubernatorial election</a>, Kentucky elected its first-ever <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> governor, <a href="William%20O.%20Bradley">William O. Bradley</a>. Bradley was able to capitalize both on divisions within the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> over the issue of <a href="Free%20Silver">Free Silver</a> and on the presence of a strong third-party candidate, <a href="Populist%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Populist</a> <a href="Thomas%20S.%20Pettit">Thomas S. Pettit</a>, to secure victory in the general election by just under 9,000 votes. This election marked the beginning of nearly thirty years of true, two-party competition in Kentucky politics.

A powerful Democratic foe of Bradley had begun his rise to power in the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">Kentucky Senate</a>. <a href="Kenton%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Kenton County</a>'s <a href="William%20Goebel">William Goebel</a> became the leader of a new group of young Democrats who were seen as enemies of large corporations, particularly the <a href="Louisville%20and%20Nashville%20Railroad">Louisville and Nashville Railroad</a>, and friends of the working man. Goebel was known as aloof and calculating. Unmarried and with few close friends of either gender, he was singularly driven by political power.

Goebel was chosen <a href="President%20Pro%20Tempore%20of%20the%20Kentucky%20Senate">president pro tem of the Senate</a> for the 1898 legislative session. On February 1, 1898, he sponsored a measure later called the Goebel Election Law. The law created a Board of Election Commissioners, appointed by the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly</a>, who were responsible for choosing election commissioners in all of <a href="List%20of%20counties%20in%20Kentucky">Kentucky's counties</a> and were empowered to decide disputed elections. Because the General Assembly was heavily Democratic, the law was attacked as blatantly partisan and self-serving to Goebel; it was opposed even by some Democrats. Nevertheless, Goebel was able to hold enough members of his party together to override Governor Bradley's <a href="veto">veto</a>, making the bill law. As leader of the party, Goebel essentially hand-picked the members of the Election Commission. He chose three staunch Democrats—W. S. Pryor, former chief justice of the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a>; <a href="William%20Thomas%20Ellis">W. T. Ellis</a>, former <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U. S. Representative</a> from <a href="Daviess%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Daviess County</a>; and C. B. Poyntz, former head of the state railroad commission. Republicans organized a <a href="Test%20case%20%28law%29">test case</a> against the law, but the Court of Appeals found it constitutional.

Three Democratic candidates had announced intentions to run for governor in 1899—Goebel, former <a href="Kentucky%20Attorney%20General">Kentucky Attorney General</a> <a href="Parker%20Watkins%20Hardin">P. Wat Hardin</a>, and former congressman <a href="William%20Johnson%20Stone">William J. Stone</a>. Hardin, a native of <a href="Mercer%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Mercer County</a>, had the backing of the <a href="Louisville%20and%20Nashville%20Railroad">Louisville and Nashville Railroad</a>. <a href="Lyon%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Lyon County</a>'s Stone had the backing of the state's agricultural interests. Goebel generally had the backing of urban voters. Going into the party's nominating convention, Hardin was the favorite to win the nomination. Knowing that combining forces was the only way to prevent Hardin's nomination, representatives of Goebel and Stone met on June 19, 1899, to work out a deal. According to <a href="Urey%20Woodson">Urey Woodson</a>, a Goebel representative at the meeting, the two sides signed an agreement whereby half of the Louisville delegation, which was committed to Goebel, would vote for Stone. Both men agreed that, should one of them be defeated or withdraw from the race, they would encourage their delegates to vote for the other rather than support Hardin.

The Democratic nominating convention began on June 20, at the Music Hall on Market Street in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a>. The first order of business was to nominate a convention chairman. <a href="Ollie%20M.%20James">Ollie M. James</a>, a supporter of Stone, nominated Judge David Redwine. When Woodson seconded the nomination, the deal between Stone and Goebel became apparent to all. Hardin supporters nominated William H. Sweeney, but the Stone-Goebel alliance elected Redwine. The membership of several county delegations was challenged; these cases would be decided by the credentials committee. This committee was also stacked against Hardin; his supporters made up just four of the thirteen members. Prolonged deliberations by the credentials committee caused the delegates to become restless, and hundreds of people—both delegates and non-delegates—entered the Music Hall attempting to disrupt the convention. When Redwine summoned Louisville city police to the hall to maintain order, Hardin supporters accused him of using intimidation tactics. The credentials committee finally issued its report on June 23. Of the twenty-eight cases where delegates were contested, twenty-six of them were decided in favor of Goebel or Stone supporters.

Formal nominations began the following day. Hardin felt as though he had been cheated and withdrew his candidacy, although some loyal delegates continued to vote for him. Delegate <a href="John%20Stockdale%20Rhea">John Stockdale Rhea</a> nominated Stone. Stone believed that his agreement with Goebel meant, with Hardin's withdrawal, Goebel would instruct his delegates to vote for Stone, maintaining a unified party. That understanding vanished when another delegate nominated Goebel. Stone was further incensed when all of the Louisville delegation voted for Goebel instead of being split between Stone and Goebel, as the two men had previously agreed. In retaliation, some Stone supporters began to back Hardin. Seeing the breakdown of the Stone-Goebel alliance, Hardin reversed his withdrawal. After numerous ballots, the convention was deadlocked on the night of June 24 with each candidate receiving about one-third of the votes. No deliberations were held on Sunday, June 25, and when the delegates reconvened on Monday, June 26, the hall was filled with police per Redwine's request. Rhea requested that the police be removed to prevent intimidation, but Redwine ruled the motion out of order. Another delegate appealed Redwine's decision, and, in violation of <a href="Parliamentary%20procedure">parliamentary rule</a>, Redwine ruled the appeal out of order. Angered by Redwine's obviously biased rulings, delegates for Stone and Hardin then began trying to disrupt the convention by blowing horns, singing, yelling, and standing on chairs. Although voting was attempted, many delegates abstained because they were unable to hear and understand what was going on. When the voting—such as it was—ended, the chair announced that Goebel had a majority of the votes cast, but Goebel sent word to Redwine that he would only accept the nomination if he received an absolute majority of the delegates. Further attempts to vote were likewise disrupted, and the meeting adjourned for the day.

On the morning of June 27, the hall was orderly. Stone and Hardin both called for the convention to <a href="Adjournment%20sine%20die">adjourn "sine die"</a>. Again, Redwine ruled this motion and the subsequent appeal of his decision out of order. Leaders for Stone and Hardin announced they would not disrupt the proceedings as they had the previous day and that they would abide by the convention's decision. As voting proceeded, Stone and Hardin unsuccessfully tried to form an alliance against Goebel, and the balloting was deadlocked for twenty-four consecutive ballots. The delegates agreed to drop the third-place candidate on the next ballot; that turned out to be Stone. The votes of the urban centers, previously divided between Stone and Goebel, now went entirely to Goebel, while the rural western counties that had supported Stone went to Hardin. The vote remained close, but as the alphabetical roll call proceeded, Goebel secured the votes of Stone's <a href="Union%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Union County</a> delegation, giving him the nomination. Following the vote, Hardin and Stone leaders pledged their support to Goebel, though some did so in qualified terms. For lieutenant governor, the Democrats nominated <a href="J.%20C.%20W.%20Beckham">J. C. W. Beckham</a> who, at age 29, was not yet legally old enough to assume the governorship if called on to do so. Goebel questioned the selection of Beckham because Beckham's native <a href="Nelson%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Nelson County</a> had voted for Hardin and was largely controlled by political boss <a href="Ben%20Johnson%20%28politician%29">Ben Johnson</a>, but Goebel's allies convinced him that Beckham would be loyal to his program. Among the other nominees was ex-<a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> soldier <a href="Robert%20Jefferson%20Breckinridge%2C%20Jr.">Robert J. Breckinridge, Jr.</a>, for attorney general. This nomination helped placate the numerous ex-Confederates in the party, since Goebel's father had fought for the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a>. It was not enough, however, to persuade Breckinridge's brother, former congressman <a href="W.%20C.%20P.%20Breckinridge">W. C. P. Breckinridge</a>, to support the ticket.

Potential Republican gubernatorial candidates were initially few. Some saw Kentucky's 18,000-vote plurality for <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201896">1896 presidential election</a> as a sure sign that the state would vote Democratic in 1899. Others were not interested in being on the defense against the inevitable Democratic attacks on the Bradley administration. Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law. Party leaders were encouraged, however, by the deep Democratic divisions at the Music Hall Convention. Sitting <a href="Kentucky%20Attorney%20General">attorney general</a> <a href="William%20S.%20Taylor">William S. Taylor</a> was the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Republican senator <a href="William%20Deboe">William Deboe</a>. Later candidates included <a href="Hopkins%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Hopkins County</a> judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state Auditor Sam H. Stone. The former was the choice of Governor Bradley, while the latter was supported by "<a href="Lexington%20Herald-Leader">Lexington Herald</a>" editor Sam J. Roberts. Taylor, like Goebel, was a skilled political organizer. He was able to create a strong <a href="political%20machine">political machine</a> amongst the county delegations and seemed the favorite to win the nomination.

The Republican nominating convention convened on July 12 in <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a>. Angry that his party had not more seriously considered his candidate, Governor Bradley did not attend. <a href="African-American">Black</a> leaders in the party threatened to follow Bradley and organize their own nominating convention, as they believed Taylor represented the "lily-white" branch of the party. Taylor attempted to hold the party together by making one of the black leaders permanent secretary of the convention and promising to appoint other black leaders to his cabinet if elected. He also tried to bring Bradley back to the convention by promising to nominate Bradley's nephew, <a href="Edwin%20P.%20Morrow">Edwin P. Morrow</a>, for secretary of state. Bradley refused the offer. In the face of Taylor's superior organization, Auditor Stone announced that he desired to see a united party and moved that Taylor be nominated unanimously; Judge Pratt seconded the motion. Other notable nominations were <a href="John%20Marshall%20%28Kentucky%29">John Marshall</a> for lieutenant governor, <a href="Caleb%20Powers">Caleb Powers</a> for secretary of state, and Judge Pratt for attorney general.

Some Democrats remained unsatisfied with the outcome of the Music Hall Convention. After a period of silence, candidate William Stone publicly detailed the arrangement he believed he had with Goebel and how Goebel had broken it. Although Goebel's allies attempted to defend him against the charges, Stone's story was soon corroborated by former congressman <a href="William%20Claiborne%20Owens">W. C. Owens</a>. Owens called on Democrats to vote for the Republican candidate, and to do so in such large numbers that no amount of political wrangling by Goebel could give him the governorship.

A group of Louisville Democrats, supporters of U. S. Senator <a href="Joseph%20Clay%20Stiles%20Blackburn">Jo Blackburn</a>, made the first formal calls for a new convention. A short time after, a large meeting at <a href="Mount%20Sterling%2C%20Kentucky">Mount Sterling</a> gave the movement a definite form. They called for a meeting in Lexington on August 2 to organize the details of a new convention. At subsequent mass meetings, it was announced that former governor <a href="John%20Y.%20Brown%20%281835%E2%80%931904%29">John Y. Brown</a> would accept the nomination of a second convention, should one be held. As Brown had been thought to be a supporter of Goebel, this announcement caused no small stir among Democrats. Representatives of sixty counties attended the August 2 meeting in Lexington. Resolutions endorsing the Democratic platform from the <a href="1896%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1896 Democratic National Convention</a> and the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan in 1900 were adopted. Then, ex-governor Brown addressed the crowd. Finally, the representatives agreed to a nominating convention to be held on August 16.

Representatives from 108 of Kentucky's 120 counties attended the convention. Among the attendees were the editors of the "Lexington Herald", "Louisville Evening Post", and "Louisville Dispatch", former congressman Owens, former <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives</a> Harvey Myers, Jr., and political bosses William Mackoy, <a href="John%20Henry%20Whallen">John Whallen</a>, and Theodore Hallam. The convention nominated an entire slate of candidates for state office, with former governor Brown at the head. They also put forward a platform condemning the Music Hall Convention, the Goebel Election Law, and the presidential administration of <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a>.

Goebel's campaign staff included Senator Jo Blackburn, former governor <a href="James%20B.%20McCreary">James B. McCreary</a>, and political boss Percy Haly. Goebel opened his campaign on August 12 in <a href="Mayfield%2C%20Kentucky">Mayfield</a>, a city in the heavily Democratic <a href="Jackson%20Purchase">Jackson Purchase</a> region of the state. He attacked the Louisville and Nashville Railroad and charged that wealthy corporate interests from outside the state were attempting to influence the choice of Kentucky's governor.

Taylor opened his campaign on August 22 in <a href="London%2C%20Kentucky">London</a>, a Republican stronghold in eastern Kentucky. Among his supporters were Senator Deboe, Congressman <a href="Samuel%20Johnson%20Pugh">Samuel Pugh</a>, Caleb Powers, and former Republican gubernatorial candidate <a href="Thomas%20Z.%20Morrow">Thomas Z. Morrow</a> (who was also the brother-in-law of Governor Bradley). Taylor stressed the economic prosperity brought about during the McKinley administration. He reminded the crowd that the Republicans had not supported the enslavement of blacks and stated they would not now support what he called the "political enslavement" that would result from electing Goebel.

Brown opened his campaign in <a href="Bowling%20Green%2C%20Kentucky">Bowling Green</a> on August 26. Because of his age and ill health, he made no more than one speech per week. Nevertheless, he toured the Commonwealth, questioning the sincerity of Goebel's Free Silver views. He continued to attack the Music Hall Convention, asking whether past great Democrats such as <a href="John%20C.%20Breckinridge">John C. Breckinridge</a> and <a href="Lazarus%20W.%20Powell">Lazarus W. Powell</a> would have supported the events that took place there. He also derided the Goebel Election Law as creating an <a href="oligarchy">oligarchy</a>. Brown's limited appearances were supplemented by speeches from his supporters.

Although ex-Confederates were generally a safe <a href="voting%20bloc">voting bloc</a> for Democrats, Goebel could not heavily rely on them because of his father's ties to the Union. Also, in 1895, Goebel had killed John Sanford, an ex-Confederate, in a <a href="duel">duel</a> stemming from a personal dispute between the two men. This made him particularly odious to Brown supporter Theodore Hallum, a friend of Sanford's, who said of Goebel at a campaign rally in Bowling Green "[W]hen the Democratic Party of Kentucky, in convention assembled, sees fit in its wisdom to nominate a yellow dog for the governorship of this great state, I will support him — but lower than that you shall not drag me." Goebel tried to mitigate his lukewarm support from ex-Confederates by courting the black vote, long given to the Republicans, though he had to do so carefully to avoid further alienating his own party base. Unlike other Democrats, Goebel had not voted on the Separate Coach Bill, a law that required blacks and whites to use segregated railroad facilities. Most blacks opposed the bill, and Goebel tried to remain silent on the issue, but when pressed, he admitted in a campaign event in <a href="Cloverport%2C%20Kentucky">Cloverport</a> that he supported the bill and would oppose its repeal. Likewise, Taylor had tried to dodge the issue of the Separate Coach Bill to avoid upsetting the "lily white" branch of his party, but a week after Goebel took a position in favor of the bill, Taylor came out against it. This marked a turning point in the campaign, as blacks, at first cool toward Taylor, now actively supported him.
The dying <a href="Populist%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Populist Party</a> had also nominated a full slate of candidates for state offices, eroding some of Goebel's populist base. Although the Populist Party platform was similar to Goebel's, it also explicitly condemned the Goebel Election Law. Thomas Pettit, the Populist candidate from the 1895 gubernatorial election, campaigned for Goebel, but many of the other leaders in the party did not. With his support slipping on every side, Goebel appealed to William Jennings Bryan to come to the state and campaign for him. Known as "the Great Commoner", Bryan was immensely popular with Kentuckians, particularly Democrats and Populists. After refusing initial requests, Bryan finally came to the state and, in three days, crisscrossed the state with Goebel to stir up support. Bryan's visit helped solidify Democrats behind Goebel and took significant support from the Brown ticket.

No sooner had Bryan left the state than Governor Bradley reversed course and began stumping for Taylor. Though he insisted he only wanted to defend his administration from Democratic attacks, "<a href="Louisville%20Courier-Journal">Louisville Courier-Journal</a>" editor <a href="Henry%20Watterson">Henry Watterson</a> suggested that Bradley was seeking to enlist Taylor's support for his anticipated senatorial bid. Bradley kicked off his tour of the state in Louisville, charging that Democrats had to import an orator for their candidate because all of the state's best men had deserted him. As evidence, he cited Goebel's lack of support from Democrat <a href="John%20G.%20Carlisle">John G. Carlisle</a>, his former ally, as well as Senator <a href="William%20Lindsay%20%28Kentucky%20politician%29">William Lindsay</a>, W. C. P. Breckinridge, John Y. Brown, Theodore Hallum, W. C. Owens, Wat Hardin, and William Stone. He also encouraged blacks not to desert the Republican Party. He contrasted his appointments of blacks to his cabinet with the Democrats' support of the Separate Coach Bill. Bradley and Republican leader (and later governor) <a href="Augustus%20E.%20Willson">Augustus E. Willson</a> toured the state on behalf of the Republican ticket, often drawing crowds larger than those assembled for Taylor.

In the final two weeks of the campaign, Brown was injured in an accident and became a wheelchair user. This was a severe blow to an already faltering campaign, and it became clear that the race would primarily be between Goebel and Taylor. Both men spent the last days of the campaign in Louisville, knowing that, with its sizable population, it would be key to the election. Goebel continued his attack on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, supporting <a href="strike%20action">striking</a> laborers from the railroad and charging that the Republican party was controlled by <a href="Trust%20%2819th%20century%29">trusts</a>. Both Republicans and Democrats warned of the possibility that election fraud and violence would be perpetrated by the other side. Louisville mayor <a href="Charles%20P.%20Weaver">Charles P. Weaver</a>, a Goebel Democrat, added 500 recruits to the city's police force just before the election, leading to charges that voter intimidation would occur in that city. Governor Bradley countered by ordering the state militia to be ready to quell any disturbances across the state. On election day, the headline of the "Courier-Journal" proclaimed "<a href="Bayonet">BAYONET</a> Rule".

For all the claims about the potential for violence, election day, November 7, remained mostly calm across the state. Fewer than a dozen people were arrested statewide. Voting returns were slow, and on election night, the race was still too close to call. When the official tally was announced, Taylor had won by a vote of 193,714 to 191,331. Brown had garnered 12,040 votes, and Populist candidate Blair had captured 2,936. Had Goebel been able to win the votes that went to either of the third party candidates, he could have saved the election for the Democrats. Charges of fraud began even before the official returns were announced. In Nelson County, 1,200 ballots listed the Republican candidate as "W. P. Taylor" instead of "W. S. Taylor"; Democrats claimed these votes should be invalidated. In <a href="Knox%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Knox</a> and <a href="Johnson%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Johnson</a> counties, voters complained of "thin tissue ballots" that allowed the voter's choices to be seen through them. One Democratic political boss even called for the entire Louisville vote to be invalidated because the state militia had intimidated voters there. (Taylor had won by about 3,000 votes in Louisville.)

Republicans gained an early victory when the Court of Appeals ruled that the Nelson County vote should stand. The final result of the election, however, would be decided by the Board of Elections, created by the Goebel Election Law. Newspapers across the state, both Democratic and Republican, called for the board's decision to be accepted as final. Tensions grew as the date for the board's hearings drew near, and small bands of armed men from heavily Republican eastern Kentucky began to arrive in <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort</a>, the state capital. Just before the board's decision was announced, the number of armed mountain men was estimated at 500. Although the board was thought to be controlled by Goebel, it rendered a surprise 2–1 decision to let the announced vote tally stand. The board's majority opinion claimed that they did not have any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899. Democrats were outraged; party leaders met on December 14 and called on Goebel and Beckham to contest the election. Goebel had been inclined to let the result stand and seek a seat in the U. S. Senate in 1901, but he heeded the wishes of his party's leaders and contested the board's decision.

Allie Young, chairman of the state Democratic Party, called a caucus of the Democratic members of the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly</a> to be held on January 1, 1900. As a result of the caucus, J. C. S. Blackburn was nominated for a seat in the U. S. Senate, Goebel was nominated as president pro tem of the Kentucky Senate, and <a href="South%20Trimble">South Trimble</a> was nominated as <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">speaker of the House</a>. When the General Assembly convened, each Democratic nominee was elected, the party possessing heavy majorities in both houses. Lieutenant Governor Marshall presented a list of committees to the Senate, but that body voted 19–17 to set aside this list and approve a list provided by Goebel instead. Similarly, in the House, the list of committees presented by Speaker Trimble and approved by that body enumerated forty committees, none of them with a Republican majority.

Goebel's and Beckham's challenges to the election results were received by the General Assembly on January 2. The following day, the Assembly appointed a contest committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges, <a href="voter%20fraud">voter fraud</a> and illegal military intimidation of voters among them. The members of the committee were drawn at random, although the drawing was likely rigged—only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee. (Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans.) The joint committee on the rules recommended that the contest committee report at the pleasure of the General Assembly, that debate was limited once the findings were presented, and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly. The rules further provided that the speaker of the House would preside over this joint session instead of the lieutenant governor, as was customary. The Republican minority fought these provisions, but the Democratic majority passed them over their opposition.

Republicans around the state expected the committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor. Additional armed men from eastern Kentucky filled the capital. Taylor, recognizing that the slightest incident could lead to violence, ordered the men home, and many of them complied. Still, two or three hundred remained, awaiting the election committee's findings. Others remained as witnesses set to testify before the contest committee. Some of these Republican witnesses were arrested by local police, who were mostly Goebel partisans. Governor Taylor issued pardons for some of them, citing their claims that the police robbed them upon their arrest. To avoid arrest for <a href="Weapon%20possession%20%28crime%29">carrying a concealed weapon</a>, many of the Republican partisans began wearing their guns openly, adding to the tensions in the city, but effectively reducing the number of arrests by local police.
On the morning of January 30, as Goebel and two friends walked toward the <a href="Old%20State%20Capitol%20%28Kentucky%29">capitol building</a>, a shot rang out, and Goebel fell wounded. He was taken to a nearby hotel to be treated for his wounds. Soldiers filled the streets and blocked entrance to the capitol. Defiantly, the contest committee met in Frankfort's <a href="city%20hall">city hall</a>. By a strictly party-line vote, they adopted a majority report that claimed Goebel and Beckham had received the most legitimate votes and should be installed in their respective offices.

A little over an hour after the committee's meeting, Governor Taylor declared a state of insurrection and called out the state militia. He called the legislature into special session, not in Frankfort, but in heavily Republican London, which he insisted was a safer location. Defiant Democratic legislators refused to heed the call to London, but when they attempted to convene first in the state capitol and later in other public locations in Frankfort, they found the doors barred by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Goebel was sworn in, and immediately ordered the state militia to stand down. He also ordered the General Assembly to reconvene in Frankfort. The Republican militia refused to disband, and a rival Democratic militia formed across the lawn of the state capitol. Civil war seemed possible.

Taylor apprised President McKinley of the situation in Kentucky. He stopped short of asking for intervention by federal troops, and McKinley assured a delegation of Kentucky's federal legislators that such intervention would occur only as a last resort. Republican legislators made preparations to heed Taylor's call to convene in London on February 5. Meanwhile, in order to resolve any doubts about the legitimacy of their earlier meeting, Democratic legislators met at the state house—no longer being denied entrance by the state militia—and again voted to adopt the majority report declaring Goebel and Beckham the winners of the election. Both men again took the oath of office.

As a test to see if his gubernatorial authority was still recognized, Taylor issued a <a href="clemency">pardon</a> for a man convicted of <a href="manslaughter">manslaughter</a> in Knott County. The pardon was signed by the proper county officials, but officers at the penitentiary refused to release the man. It was feared that Taylor would dispatch the state militia to remove the prisoner, but no further attempts were made to secure his release. Continuing to live under heavy guard in his executive office, Taylor was criticized for not having offered a reward for the capture of Goebel's unknown assailant. Responding that he was not authorized to make an offer in the absence of a request to do so by the officials in Franklin County, he offered a $500 reward from his own money.

Goebel died of his wounds on February 3. He remains the only American governor ever assassinated while in office. With Goebel, the most controversial figure in the election, dead, tensions began to ease somewhat. Leaders from both sides drafted an agreement whereby Taylor and Lieutenant Governor Marshall would step down from their respective offices; in exchange, they would receive <a href="immunity%20from%20prosecution">immunity from prosecution</a> in any actions they may have taken with regard to Goebel's assassination. The state militia would withdraw from Frankfort, and the Goebel Election Law would be repealed and replaced with a fairer law. Despite the agreement of his allies, Taylor refused to sign the agreement. He did, however, lift the ban on the General Assembly meeting in Frankfort.

When the legislature convened on February 19, two sets of officers attempted to preside. Marshall and Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, both claimed the right to preside over the state senate. Taylor sued to prevent Beckham from exercising any authority in the senate; Beckham counter-sued for possession of the capitol and executive building. The cases were consolidated, and both Republicans and Democrats agreed to let the courts decide the election. On March 10, a <a href="circuit%20court">circuit court</a> found in favor of Beckham and the Democrats. By a 6–1 vote, the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a>, the state's <a href="court%20of%20last%20resort">court of last resort</a> at the time, upheld the circuit court's decision on April 6, legally unseating Taylor and Marshall. The case of "<a href="Taylor%20v.%20Beckham">Taylor v. Beckham</a>" was eventually appealed to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a>, but the court refused to intervene in the case because it found that there were no federal questions involved. The lone justice dissenting from that opinion was Kentuckian <a href="John%20Marshall%20Harlan">John Marshall Harlan</a>.

Sixteen <a href="indictment">indictment</a>s were returned in connection with Goebel's assassination, including one against deposed governor Taylor. In May 1900, Taylor fled to <a href="Indianapolis%2C%20Indiana">Indianapolis, Indiana</a>, and the <a href="Governor%20of%20Indiana">governor</a>, <a href="James%20A.%20Mount">James A. Mount</a> refused to <a href="extradition">extradite</a> him for trial. Three others charged in the assassination <a href="Turn%20state%27s%20evidence">turned state's evidence</a>. Only five of the sixteen went to trial; two of those were acquitted. Three men were eventually convicted for playing roles in Goebel's assassination. Kentucky's Secretary of State, <a href="Caleb%20Powers">Caleb Powers</a>, was accused of being the mastermind behind the assassination. Henry Youtsey, the State Auditor of Kentucky, was said to have aided the assassin. James B. Howard, a participant in a bloody feud in <a href="Clay%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Clay County</a> was charged with being the actual assassin.

According to the prosecution's theory, the assassin shot Goebel from the secretary of state's office on the first floor of a building next to the state capitol. However, much of the testimony against the accused men was conflicting, and some of it was later proven to be <a href="perjury">perjured</a>. Most of the state's judges were Democratic supporters of Goebel and juries were packed with partisan Democrats. The appellate courts, however, were largely Republican, and the convictions returned by the lower courts were often overturned, with the cases being remanded for new trials. Howard was tried and convicted in September 1900, January 1902, and April 1903; his final appeal failed, and he was sentenced to <a href="Life%20imprisonment">life in prison</a>. Powers was also convicted three times—in July 1900, October 1901, and August 1903; a fourth trial in November 1907 ended in a <a href="hung%20jury">hung jury</a>. In 1908, Powers and Howard were <a href="clemency">pardoned</a> by Republican governor <a href="Augustus%20E.%20Willson">Augustus E. Willson</a>. Months later, Willson also issued pardons for former governor Taylor and several others still under indictment. Despite the pardon, Taylor seldom returned to Kentucky; he became an insurance executive in Indiana and died there in 1928. Youtsey, the only defendant not to appeal his sentence, was <a href="parole">parole</a>d in 1916 and pardoned in 1919 by Democratic governor <a href="James%20D.%20Black">James D. Black</a>.

Halkett boat

A Halkett boat is a type of lightweight <a href="inflatable%20boat">inflatable boat</a> designed by (1820–1885) during the 1840s. Halkett had long been interested in the difficulties of travelling in the <a href="Canadian%20Arctic">Canadian Arctic</a>, and the problems involved in designing boats light enough to be carried over arduous terrain, but robust enough to be used in extreme weather conditions.

Halkett's first design was a collapsible and inflatable boat made of rubber-impregnated cloth. When deflated, the hull of the boat could be worn as a cloak, the oar used as a walking stick, and the sail as an umbrella. This was followed by a two-man craft that was small enough to fit into a <a href="knapsack">knapsack</a>, and when deflated served as a waterproof blanket.

Although widely praised by Canadian explorers, Halkett's designs had a limited market, and he was unable to persuade the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> that they would serve any useful purpose in general naval service. Efforts to market them as platforms for fishing and duck shooting failed, and they were commercially unsuccessful. Only two Halkett boats, that of <a href="Orcadian">Orcadian</a> explorer <a href="John%20Rae%20%28explorer%29">John Rae</a>, and one held in the Hudson's Bay Company Museum Collection at the <a href="Manitoba%20Museum">Manitoba Museum</a> are known to survive today.

Peter Halkett was a <a href="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> in the 1840s. The son of John Halkett, a director of the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> who for many years had lived in Canada before returning to England, Peter Halkett had long held an interest in the exploration of the <a href="Canadian%20Arctic">Canadian Arctic</a>. He had a particular interest in <a href="John%20Franklin">John Franklin</a>'s disastrous <a href="Coppermine%20Expedition%20of%201819%E2%80%931822">Coppermine Expedition of 1819–1822</a>.
Franklin's three-year exploration of the northern coast of Canada in search of the <a href="Northwest%20Passage">Northwest Passage</a> had ended in disaster amid accusations of murder and cannibalism, with 11 of the 20 members of the group killed and the survivors reduced to eating lichen, their own boots, and the remains of rotten carcasses abandoned by wolves. The party had become stranded on the wrong side of the <a href="Coppermine%20River">Coppermine River</a> after their boats had been destroyed in a storm; <a href="John%20Richardson%20%28naturalist%29">John Richardson</a> had attempted to swim to safety and suffered severe <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a>. A single member of the party had fashioned a small canoe from canvas and willow, and the survivors had been obliged to cross the river one at a time using the makeshift canoe.

Halkett was an amateur inventor, and during his spare time whilst serving in the navy he worked on solving the problem of how to design a boat that would be small and light enough to transport easily on foot through wilderness, but robust enough to carry people in safety across wide bodies of water. His solution was to design a boat in which all components would double as items of clothing, or accessories that Halkett assumed the user would be carrying in any event.

Halkett designed a waterproof <a href="cloak">cloak</a> made from an early form of <a href="Mackintosh">Macintosh cloth</a>, cotton impregnated with <a href="India%20rubber">India rubber</a> by using <a href="naphtha">naphtha</a> as a solvent. The lining of the cloak contained an airtight and watertight inflatable ovoid, split into four separate airtight compartments in case of puncture, and a pocket containing a <a href="paddle">paddle</a> blade and a small <a href="bellows">bellows</a>. The wearer of the cloak would carry a walking stick, which would double as the shaft of the paddle, and a large umbrella to serve as a sail. The cloak weighed around in total, and took three to four minutes to inflate; once inflated, it could support the weight of six to eight people.

In early 1844, Halkett successfully tested a prototype boat-cloak on the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>, paddling it without taking on any water, despite, in his words, being "met by—passed by—and almost run down by—various Metropolitan Steamers plying to and fro in their several vocations, and causing no little commotion in the troubled waters of the River". Buoyed by this success, he took the prototype boat-cloak with him while on naval service, using it whenever the opportunity arose to test it under various sea conditions. In November 1844, Halkett hoped to test the boat-cloak in bad weather conditions, in the rough seas of the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a>, but the weather was unusually calm. He was forced to take down his umbrella, and paddle, recalling later that "the winds that day were too civil by half, and the sleepless bay almost quite dormant". The boat-cloak was positively received by explorers; John Richardson (who had almost died during the 1819–1822 Coppermine expedition) wrote that "Had we been possessed of such a contrivance in our first expedition, I have little doubt of our having brought the whole party in safely".

Spurred on by the successful testing of the boat-cloak, Halkett designed a larger version that folded into a knapsack. When inflated, it could carry two men, operating a paddle on each side, and when deflated served as a waterproof blanket to allow the users to camp on wet ground. The <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> was sceptical about potential uses for Halkett's designs; on 8 May 1845 <a href="Sidney%20Herbert%2C%201st%20Baron%20Herbert%20of%20Lea">Lord Herbert</a>, <a href="First%20Secretary%20to%20the%20Admiralty">First Secretary to the Admiralty</a> wrote to Halkett that "My Lords are of an opinion that your invention is extremely clever and ingenious, and that it might be useful in Exploring and Surveying Expeditions, but they do not consider that it would be made applicable for general purposes in the Naval Service".
Although the Admiralty saw no use to which Halkett's designs could be put in general naval service, this larger design was extremely well received by explorers. John Franklin bought one to take on the ill-fated <a href="Franklin%27s%20lost%20expedition">1845 expedition</a> in which the entire expedition party of 129 men and two ships vanished. Franklin saw Halkett boats as so essential to travel in Canada that he gave the boat intended for his expedition to <a href="George%20Simpson%20%28administrator%29">Sir George Simpson</a>, Governor-in-Chief of <a href="Rupert%27s%20Land">Rupert's Land</a>, for use in his travels in the region. He ordered a replacement boat from Halkett, who delivered it in time for him to take possession before setting out on his last expedition.

<a href="Orkney">Orkney</a>man <a href="John%20Rae%20%28explorer%29">John Rae</a>, known by the <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a> as (, "He who takes long strides"), was a Hudson's Bay Company <a href="surgeon">surgeon</a> who became a surveyor of the Canadian Arctic. Unlike most Europeans of the period, Rae believed that the local inhabitants knew best how to cope with extreme weather conditions. He travelled Inuit-style, using <a href="sledge">sledge</a>s and <a href="snowshoe">snowshoe</a>s and sleeping in snow <a href="igloo">igloo</a>s. Rae took a Halkett boat on his first expedition in 1846, reporting that it was "most useful in crossing and recrossing the river at <a href="Repulse%20Bay%2C%20Nunavut">Repulse Bay</a>", and that "although in constant use for upwards of six weeks on a rocky coast it never required the slightest repair" and "ought to form part of the equipment of every expedition".

Keen to find out what had become of the ships and men of Franklin's expedition, in 1848 the Royal Navy sent a search party led by <a href="Rae%E2%80%93Richardson%20Arctic%20Expedition">John Richardson and John Rae</a>, and equipped with a Halkett boat provided by the government, to search for the lost expedition. The party was unable to locate Franklin, but found the Halkett boat invaluable, on one occasion using the single boat to ferry their entire party across a river in 14 trips. Rae noted that although the rubber of the boat became stiff from the cold, there was no difficulty in warming it to soften the material when necessary. Halkett boats were likewise taken on the subsequent expedition that was sent to search for Franklin, during which they were successfully used for fishing.

In 1851 French explorer <a href="Joseph%20Ren%C3%A9%20Bellot">Joseph René Bellot</a> mounted another expedition to find Franklin, sponsored by Franklin's wife. Bellot took a Halkett boat-cloak on the journey, noting in his journal that it was "of immense value in a country where the want of wood renders it impossible to form any sort of raft". Bellot's expedition was unable to locate Franklin, and it was not until 1853 that an expedition led by Rae (equipped with "two beautiful Halkett boats") located a group of Inuit who recounted seeing men dragging a boat four years earlier, and later finding their bodies.

Despite being promoted as ideal for lake-fishing and duck-shooting, and being exhibited in the <a href="Great%20Exhibition">Great Exhibition</a> of 1851, Halkett's boat designs were not commercially successful and never entered general use outside the specialised field of Canadian exploration. Later promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28nautical%29">Captain</a>, Halkett died on 23 March 1885, aged 65, and the manufacture of his boat designs was abandoned. John Rae gave his boat from the 1853 expedition to a Miss Peace of <a href="Kirkwall">Kirkwall</a>, and it lay forgotten on the rafters of a Kirkwall woodyard. It was identified and recovered many years later, and is now displayed in the <a href="Stromness">Stromness</a> Museum at Orkney. A second surviving example is held in the Hudson's Bay Company Museum Collection at the <a href="Manitoba%20Museum">Manitoba Museum</a>.

William of Wrotham

William of Wrotham or William de Wrotham (died <a href="circa">c.</a> 1217) was a medieval English royal administrator and clergyman. Although a late 13th-century source says that William held a royal office under King <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II of England</a> (reigned 1154–1189), the first contemporary reference to William is in 1197, when he became responsible for, among other things, the royal tin mines. He also held ecclesiastical office, eventually becoming <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Taunton">Archdeacon of Taunton</a>, and served King <a href="John%20of%20England">John of England</a> as an administrator of ecclesiastical lands and a collector of taxes.

William's main administrative work was naval. He was in charge of the royal fleet in the south of England in 1205, and was one of those responsible for the development of <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> as a naval dockyard. He continued to be involved in naval matters until 1214 or later, but by 1215 he had joined the <a href="First%20Barons%27%20War">First Barons' War</a> against John. After John's death in 1216, William returned to the royalist cause. He probably died in late 1217. Known to a contemporary chronicler as one of John's "evil advisers", William is said by modern historians to have had a "special responsibility for ports, customs, and the navy", and was "keeper of ports", a forerunner of the office of <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>.

Little is known of William's background or family, except that his father Godwin <a href="Feudal%20land%20tenure%20in%20England">held</a> land in <a href="Shipbourne">Shipbourne</a>, near <a href="Wrotham">Wrotham</a> in Kent, perhaps as a <a href="vassal">vassal</a> of the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishops of Canterbury</a>. William's brother Richard was named as William's deputy in 1207.

According to late 13th-century documents, the <a href="Hundred%20Rolls">Hundred Rolls</a>, King Henry II gave William the office of <a href="Steward%20%28office%29">steward</a> of <a href="Exmoor">Exmoor</a>, and lands at <a href="North%20Petherton">North Petherton</a>, Somerset. William was the <a href="prebend">prebend</a> of <a href="Decuman">St Decumans</a> in the <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> of <a href="Bath%20Abbey">Bath Cathedral</a> by 9 May 1204. He claimed to have held the office since 1194 during a later dispute with <a href="Savaric%20FitzGeldewin">Savaric fitzGeldewin</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Bath">Bishop of Bath</a> and another <a href="canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a> of the cathedral, Roger Porretanus, who claimed the prebend. By 23 December 1205, William had secured a papal judgement against Roger.

William may have owed his advancement in royal service to <a href="Geoffrey%20fitz%20Peter">Geoffrey fitzPeter</a>, a royal judge. In 1197 he granted William a <a href="manor">manor</a> at <a href="Sutton-at-Hone">Sutton-at-Hone</a>, Kent, which later was supposed to become a hospital, but instead eventually became a <a href="preceptory">preceptory</a> for the <a href="Knights%20Hospitaller">Knights Hospitaller</a>. From 1197 William was responsible for the collection of revenues from Geoffrey's lands at <a href="Lydford">Lydford</a>, Devon, and held the office of chief <a href="forester">forester</a> of Somerset; it is unclear to whom he owed that position.

In 1197, <a href="Hubert%20Walter">Hubert Walter</a>, who was Archbishop of Canterbury and <a href="Justiciar">Justiciar</a>, appointed William to the administration of the royal <a href="stannary">stannaries</a>, or tin mines, and in 1198 William was placed in charge of tin production, an office later known as the <a href="Lord%20Warden%20of%20the%20Stannaries">Lord Warden of the Stannaries</a>. Under his control the mines became much more lucrative for the king, and accounted for a total of £1100 in William's first year of administration. As part of his administrative work he became the first warden of <a href="Lydford%20Castle">Lydford Castle</a> after it was constructed in the 1190s. In 1199 he was involved in a dispute over the stannaries with another official, Hugh Bardulf, temporarily losing control of them – along with his office as sheriff – in 1200. The reason for the loss of these offices is uncertain. After restoration to office, he remained as Lord Warden of the Stannaries until 1215.

In 1198 and 1199, William was <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Devon">Sheriff of Devon</a> and <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Cornwall">Sheriff of Cornwall</a>, along with another royal servant, and served as a <a href="royal%20justice">royal justice</a>. In 1200 he was recorded as a receiver of the <a href="carucage">carucage</a>, a tax on land, in the <a href="Pipe%20roll">Pipe roll</a>; whether this meant that he was a local or a national collector of the tax is unclear. By 12 September 1204, William was Archdeacon of Taunton in the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Bath">Diocese of Bath</a>, and he witnessed the election of <a href="Jocelin%20of%20Wells">Jocelin of Wells</a> as the new bishop of the <a href="diocese">diocese</a>. He was jointly placed in charge of the mints of London and Canterbury in 1205, along with <a href="Reginald%20de%20Cornhill">Reginald de Cornhill</a>, with whom he also shared the collection of the <a href="Taxation%20in%20medieval%20England">tax of a fifteenth on merchants</a>, a post the two had held since 1202. In May 1205 William, along with de Cornhill, was given custody of one of three <a href="Coining%20%28mint%29">die</a>s for the mint at <a href="Chichester">Chichester</a>; in July the king gave William's custody to <a href="Simon%20of%20Wells">Simon of Wells</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Chichester">Bishop of Chichester</a>. William was one of the officials in charge of the collection of a tax of a thirteenth in 1207.

William was also placed in charge of vacant ecclesiastical offices, collecting their revenues for the king. He performed this office for the <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Worcester">Diocese of Worcester</a> around 1200, the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Winchester">Diocese of Winchester</a> in 1204, for <a href="Glastonbury%20Abbey">Glastonbury Abbey</a> in 1205, and for <a href="Whitby%20Abbey">Whitby Abbey</a> in 1206 and 1209. From his actions it can be assumed that Wrotham was a member of the <a href="royal%20household">royal household</a>, probably working in the <a href="Wardrobe%20%28government%29">wardrobe</a>.

William's main administrative work concerned the navy. In 1204 he, de Cornhill, and William of Furnell were placed in charge of granting wool export licences. William of Wrotham was also one of the officials charged with supervising the ships dispatched to the coasts in 1204, after the loss of Normandy exposed England to invasion by the French. In 1205 he was again one of the keepers of the royal fleet along the south coast. William was in charge of the 17 ships based in <a href="Romney%20Island">Romney</a>, <a href="Rye%2C%20East%20Sussex">Rye</a>, <a href="Shoreham-by-Sea">Shoreham</a>, <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a>, <a href="Winchelsea">Winchelsea</a>, and <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>, while the rest of the fleet came under Cornhill's control. In the same year, he was also in charge of naval spending for the attempted invasion of France, which in June alone totalled over 470 <a href="pound%20sterling">pounds</a>. William surrendered custody of <a href="Taunton%20Castle">Taunton Castle</a> to <a href="Peter%20de%20Taraton">Peter de Taraton</a> in July and was in charge of purchasing the royal wine in August. No further naval duties are recorded until November, when along with Cornhill he was responsible for assessing the ports.

In 1206 William was in charge of the naval forces in the <a href="Cinque%20Ports">Cinque Ports</a> and commanded the fleet that invaded <a href="Poitou">Poitou</a>. Whether he accompanied the fleet or stayed in England after it sailed is unclear; according to two historians – F. W. Brooks and R. W. Powell – it is more likely he stayed. From 1206 until 1215 he was effectively commander of King <a href="John%2C%20King%20of%20England">John</a>'s navy, and helped to develop <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> as a royal dockyard. In 1208 William was put in charge of ensuring that no ships sailed without royal permission. That year he also oversaw the naval preparations made by the Cinque Ports. The purpose of these preparations is unknown; the "<a href="Annals%20of%20Dunstable">Annals of Dunstable</a>" ascribe to John a desire to oppress the Cinque Ports. During May 1208 a royal order was issued that William's deputies in all the seaports should seize any ships in the ports that were from foreign countries, excluding Denmark, Norway and other countries that did not oppose John's diplomatic efforts. A gap in the governmental records does not allow a detailed view of William's activities for the next years, until 1212, when William is shown performing many of the same duties as earlier. He was in charge of repair of some ships and the construction of a large new ship, named the "Deulabenit", owned by the king. William was also responsible for <a href="impressment">impressing</a> privately owned merchant ships into royal service. These ships were used in the naval action of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Damme">Battle of Damme</a> at <a href="Zwyn">Zwyn</a> in 1213, when a fleet under <a href="William%20Longesp%C3%A9e%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">William Longespee</a>, the Earl of Salisbury, destroyed a substantial French naval force and sacked the town of <a href="Damme">Damme</a>.

In late 1213 William was directing the efforts of the seaports of south-western England and the Cinque Ports in naval affairs. He was also responsible for the setting up of a supply depot for the navy in June 1213, for which he received supplies from the diocese of Chichester. In 1214 William had custody of some royal prisoners. The same year, the king ordered him to return a merchant ship if he had indeed seized it from its owner, Joscelin de Hampton. Also in 1214, William co-founded the hospital of <a href="Domus%20Dei">Domus Dei</a> in Portsmouth with <a href="Peter%20des%20Roches">Peter des Roches</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>. The foundation was confirmed by the king in October 1214.

John rewarded William for his service with churches in <a href="Isle%20of%20Sheppey">Sheppey</a> and <a href="East%20Malling">East Malling</a>, which were granted in 1207, and the right to oversee the <a href="royal%20forest">royal forest</a>s in Cornwall and Devon. Other grants included lands in <a href="Dartford">Dartford</a> and Sutton-at-Hone that had <a href="escheat">escheat</a>ed to the crown, lands in Westminster and a prebend in the royal ecclesiastical foundation at Hastings.

During John's reign, Pope <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20III">Innocent III</a> placed an <a href="interdict">interdict</a> on England, forbidding public celebration of sacred rites in English churches. William supported John, and remained in England. The medieval chronicler <a href="Roger%20of%20Wendover">Roger of Wendover</a> named William as one of John's "evil advisers", or "most wicked counsellors". Modern historians argue that Roger's account of John's reign, while containing some truth, was written to defame men who were prominent in the early years of King <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a>, John's son who had succeeded his father in October 1216. According to Nicholas Vincent, while Roger's account of the exactions and crimes of the members of his list of evil advisers certainly had a strong basis of truth, it was also greatly exaggerated. <a href="W.%20L.%20Warren">W. L. Warren</a> agrees and points out that many of the details of Roger's accounts that can be checked with other records are wrong, making the other parts of his stories suspect.

In 1215 William joined the baronial rebellion against John, and lost his naval offices, the royal forester's office for Somerset, and custody of Lydford Castle. In May 1216 the king offered William a safe conduct, which noted that William had fled overseas. The letters were witnessed by Peter des Roches. In mid-1217, he rejoined the royalist cause, returning to the side of Henry III. This action regained him some of his lost lands.

William last appeared in documents on 25 July 1217 and was dead by 16 February 1218, probably before 2 December 1217, when someone else is mentioned as archdeacon. On 16 February 1218, John Marshall became the guardian of Richard, William's nephew and heir, who was the son of William's brother Richard.

William has been described as having a "special responsibility for ports, customs, and the navy" by the historian <a href="Robert%20Bartlett%20%28historian%29">Robert Bartlett</a>. He is usually given the title of "keeper of ports" or "keeper of galleys", which Ralph Turner equates with being <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> in later history. Sometimes this would be given as ""custos portum maris"" in Latin, or "keeper of the seaports". At other times he was titled "keeper of the king's ships". Bartlett also called William "one of the king's most important administrators". Charles Young said that William's service to King John was a "distinguished administrative career", and J. E. A. Joliffe called William one of the "greatest of the king's clerks".
