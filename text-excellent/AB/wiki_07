1910 London to Manchester air race

The 1910 London to Manchester air race took place between two aviators, each of whom attempted to win a heavier-than-air powered <a href="Air%20racing">flight challenge</a> between <a href="London">London</a> and <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> first proposed by the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" newspaper in 1906. The £10,000 prize was won in April 1910 by Frenchman <a href="Louis%20Paulhan">Louis Paulhan</a>.

The first to make the attempt was <a href="Claude%20Grahame-White">Claude Grahame-White</a>, an Englishman from <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>. He took off from London on 23 April 1910, and made his first planned stop at <a href="Rugby%2C%20Warwickshire">Rugby</a>. His biplane subsequently suffered engine problems, forcing him to land again, near <a href="Lichfield">Lichfield</a>. High winds made it impossible for Grahame-White to continue his journey, and his aeroplane suffered further damage on the ground when it was blown over.

While Grahame-White's aeroplane was being repaired in London, Paulhan took off late on 27 April, heading for Lichfield. A few hours later Grahame-White was made aware of Paulhan's departure, and immediately set off in pursuit. The next morning, after an unprecedented night-time take-off, he almost caught up with Paulhan, but his aeroplane was overweight and he was forced to concede defeat. Paulhan reached Manchester early on 28 April, winning the challenge. Both aviators celebrated his victory at a special luncheon held at the <a href="Savoy%20Hotel">Savoy Hotel</a> in London.

The event marked the first long-distance aeroplane race in England, the first take-off of a heavier-than-air machine at night, and the first powered flight into Manchester from outside the city. Paulhan repeated the journey in April 1950, the fortieth anniversary of the original flight, this time as a passenger aboard a British jet fighter.

On 17 November 1906 the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" newspaper offered a £10,000 prize for the first aviator to fly the between <a href="London">London</a> and <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, with no more than two stops, in under 24 hours. The challenge also specified that take-off and landing were to be at locations no more than five miles from the newspaper's offices in those cities. Powered flight was a relatively new invention, and the newspaper's proprietors <a href="Daily%20Mail%20aviation%20prizes">were keen to stimulate</a> the industry's growth; in 1908 they offered £1,000 for the first flight across the <a href="English%20channel">English channel</a> (won on 25 July 1909 by the French aviator <a href="Louis%20Bl%C3%A9riot">Louis Blériot</a>), and £1,000 for the first circular one-mile flight made by a British aviator in a British aeroplane (won on 30 October 1909 by the English aviator <a href="John%20Moore-Brabazon%2C%201st%20Baron%20Brabazon%20of%20Tara">John Moore-Brabazon</a>). In 1910, two men accepted the newspaper's 1906 challenge; an Englishman, <a href="Claude%20Grahame-White">Claude Grahame-White</a>, and a Frenchman, <a href="Louis%20Paulhan">Louis Paulhan</a>.

Claude Grahame-White was born in 1879 in <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, England. He was educated at Crondall House School in <a href="Farnham">Farnham</a>, and later at <a href="Bedford%20School">Bedford Grammar School</a> between 1892 and 1896. Apprenticed to a local engineering firm, he later worked for his uncle <a href="Francis%20Willey%2C%201st%20Baron%20Barnby">Francis Willey, 1st Baron Barnby</a>. He started his own motor vehicle business in <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a>, before travelling to <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> to hunt big game. In 1909, inspired by Blériot's historic cross-channel flight, he went to France to learn how to fly, and by the following January he became one of the first Englishmen to obtain an <a href="List%20of%20pilots%20awarded%20an%20Aviator%27s%20Certificate%20by%20the%20A%C3%A9ro-Club%20de%20France%20in%201910">aviator's certificate</a>. He also started a flying school at <a href="Pau%2C%20Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Atlantiques">Pau</a>, which he moved to England later that year.

Isidore Auguste Marie Louis Paulhan, better known as Louis Paulhan, was born in 1883 in <a href="P%C3%A9zenas">Pézenas</a>, in the south of France. After doing military service at the balloon school at <a href="Meudon%23Pioneering%20aviation">Chalais-Meudon</a> he had worked as an assistant for <a href="Ferdinand%20Ferber">Ferdinand Ferber</a> before winning a <a href="Voisin%201907%20biplane">Voisin</a> biplane in an aircraft design competition. Paulhan taught himself to fly using this aircraft, and was awarded Aéro Club de France licence No. 10 on 17 July. Paulhan was no stranger to British audiences; he competed in an early flight meeting in October 1909 at <a href="Blackpool">Blackpool</a>, and shortly afterwards flew in an exhibition at the <a href="Brooklands">Brooklands</a> motor racing circuit. Paulhan took part in many airshows, including several in the United States of America, and in <a href="Douai">Douai</a>, where in July 1909 he set new records for altitude and flight duration.

Grahame-White was the first to attempt the journey. He planned to take off at 5:00 am on 23 April 1910, near the Plumes Hotel in the London suburb of <a href="Park%20Royal">Park Royal</a>. A crowd of journalists and interested spectators assembled there from about 4:00 am, with more arriving by car, until about 200–300 were present. "The Times" described the sky as "clear and starlit", and the weather as "very cold, as there was a slight frost." Grahame-White arrived at about 4:30 am and began to prepare his <a href="Farman%20III">Farman III</a> <a href="biplane">biplane</a>. The aeroplane was brought into the field from the yard it was stored in, and its seven-cylinder 50 hp <a href="rotary%20engine">rotary engine</a> was started. Once the engine warmed up, Grahame-White took his seat. Several people wished him well, including his sister, mother and <a href="Henry%20Farman">Henry Farman</a>. He guided the biplane for about 30–60 yards across the frosted grass, and took off at about 5:12 am, before altering his direction to head for the start of the course—a <a href="Gas%20holder">gasometer</a> at <a href="Wormwood%20Scrubs">Wormwood Scrubs</a>, within the required five-mile radius of the "Daily Mail" office in London.

Cheered loudly by the thousands of spectators who anticipated his arrival, Grahame-White flew across the starting point and turned north-west toward <a href="Wembley">Wembley</a>. Standing on top of the gasometer, <a href="Harold%20Perrin">Harold Perrin</a>, secretary of the <a href="Royal%20Aero%20Club">Royal Aero Club</a>, waved a flag to indicate the start of Grahame-White's attempt. By 5:35 am the aviator was over <a href="Watford">Watford</a>, and at 6:15 am he flew over <a href="Leighton%20Buzzard">Leighton Buzzard</a>. Crowds of cheering spectators were there to greet him as he flew above the line of the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway">London and North Western Railway</a>, at an altitude of about . Meanwhile, Perrin and two mechanics from <a href="Gnome%20et%20Rh%C3%B4ne">Gnome et Rhône</a> (who supplied the engine used on the Farman III) boarded one of two cars, and were headed for <a href="Rugby%2C%20Warwickshire">Rugby</a>. Along the way, one car took a short cut across a field and crashed into a ridge; one occupant was seriously injured.
Grahame-White made his first stop in Rugby just after 7:15 am. One of the cars that left London arrived about 10 minutes before he landed, and his mechanics attended to his aeroplane. News of his take-off in London reached the area, and a large crowd gathered; they were kept from the aeroplane by a group of <a href="scouting">boy scouts</a>. Grahame-White was taken to nearby Gellings Farm, where he drank coffee and ate biscuits, and told those present about his journey. "It was wretchedly cold all the way ... and I was cold at the start. My eyes suffered towards the end, and my fingers were quite numbed." Grahame-White's average speed was estimated at more than ; a few of the vehicles following him from London did not arrive until some time after his descent.

He took off again at about 8:25 am, but was unable to reach his next scheduled stop at <a href="Crewe">Crewe</a>. About 30 miles outside Rugby a problem with the engine's inlet valves forced him to land in a field at <a href="Hademore">Hademore</a>, four miles outside of <a href="Lichfield">Lichfield</a>—about 115 miles into the 185-mile journey. On landing, he damaged a skid, and his mechanics were <a href="telegraphy">telegraphed</a> for. While the necessary repairs were being made, Grahame-White ate lunch and then slept for a few hours, looked after by his mother, who had arrived by car. Meanwhile, a large crowd of interested spectators gathered, and the farmer who owned the field charged them for admission. Soldiers from a nearby barracks kept the public from getting too close to the biplane.

As the sun fell the wind grew in strength, and at 7:00 pm Grahame-White conceded that the high winds made any further progress impossible. He decided to try again at 3:00 am, hoping to reach Manchester by the 5:15 am deadline, but at 3:30 am he abandoned the attempt, and said that he would travel to Manchester and try again from there. He ordered the soldiers to peg the aeroplane down, but his instructions were ignored; the next night it was blown over by strong winds and severely damaged.

Grahame-White's biplane was returned to London, and on 25 April was being repaired at Wormwood Scrubs, in the "Daily Mail"'s hangar. Paulhan arrived at <a href="Dover">Dover</a> from <a href="California">California</a>, where he performed exhibition flights. Another competitor, <a href="Emile%20Dubonnet">Emile Dubonnet</a>, also formally entered the contest, and was due to try a few days later. On 27 April 1910 Paulhan's biplane (a newer model than Grahame-White's) was brought to <a href="Hendon">Hendon</a>, on the site of what is now the London branch of the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force%20Museum%20London">Royal Air Force Museum</a>. It was assembled in less than 11 hours, and at 5:21 pm that day Paulhan took off for Hampstead Cemetery, his official starting line. He arrived there ten minutes later, flew on to <a href="Harrow%2C%20London">Harrow</a>, and began to follow the route of the London and North Western Railway. The railway company prepared for the event by whitewashing the <a href="Railroad%20tie">sleepers</a> of the correct line for the competitors to follow. Paulhan was followed by a special train, on board which were Mme. Paulhan and <a href="Henry%20Farman">Henry Farman</a>. Other members of his party followed by car.

Grahame-White attempted to make a test flight earlier that day, but the huge crowds hampered his efforts, and he was unable to take off. Having spent two days supervising the reconstruction of his aeroplane, he retired to a nearby hotel. At about 6:10 pm he was awakened with the news that Paulhan had begun his attempt, and he decided to set off in pursuit. This time he had no trouble clearing a space in the crowd. His biplane's engine was started, and by 6:29 pm he passed the starting line. Almost an hour later he flew over Leighton Buzzard, just as Paulhan was passing over Rugby. As night approached, Grahame-White landed his aeroplane in a field near the railway line at <a href="Roade">Roade</a>, in <a href="Northamptonshire">Northamptonshire</a>. Fifteen minutes later, Paulhan reached <a href="Lichfield">Lichfield</a>, where about into his journey he ran out of fuel. He managed to land the biplane in a field near <a href="Lichfield%20Trent%20Valley%20railway%20station">Trent Valley railway station</a>. The aeroplane was pegged down, and Paulhan left with his colleagues to stay overnight at a nearby hotel. Grahame-White meanwhile stayed at the house of a Dr. Ryan. Both aviators intended to restart at 3:00 am the following day.
Still about behind the Frenchman, Grahame-White made a historic decision; he would make an unprecedented night flight. Guided by the headlamps of his party's cars, he took off at 2:50 am. Within minutes of becoming airborne however, he almost crashed; while he was leaning forward to make himself comfortable, his jacket brushed the engine ignition switch and he accidentally turned the engine off, but he quickly corrected his error and was able to continue. Using the lights of railway stations to guide his course through the pitch black night, within 40 minutes he reached Rugby, and at 3:50 am he passed <a href="Nuneaton">Nuneaton</a>. Despite making good progress, Grahame-White was carrying a large load of fuel and oil, and his engine was not powerful enough to raise the aeroplane over the high ground before him. Disappointed, he landed at <a href="Polesworth">Polesworth</a>, about from London, and only 10 miles behind Paulhan. A few minutes later the Frenchman, unaware of Grahame-White's progress, resumed his journey. He passed <a href="Stafford">Stafford</a> at 4:45 am, <a href="Crewe">Crewe</a> at 5:20 am, and at 5:32 am he landed at Barcicroft Fields near <a href="Didsbury">Didsbury</a>, within five miles of the Manchester office of the "Daily Mail", thereby winning the contest. His party was taken by train to a civic reception, held by the Lord Mayor of Manchester. Grahame-White was notified of Paulhan's success, and reportedly shouted "Ladies and gentlemen, the £10,000 prize has been won by Louis Paulhan, the finest aviator that the world has ever seen. Compared with him I am only a novice. Three cheers for Paulhan!" He retired to bed, leaving his mechanics to repair his aeroplane, and later sent Paulhan a telegram, congratulating his rival on his achievement. Grahame-White attempted to resume his journey to Manchester, and reached <a href="Tamworth%2C%20Staffordshire">Tamworth</a>, but he later abandoned the flight.

Paulhan was presented with his prize—a golden casket containing a cheque for £10,000—on 30 April 1910, during a luncheon at the <a href="Savoy%20Hotel">Savoy Hotel</a> in London. The event was presided over by the editor of the "Daily Mail", Thomas Marlowe (in lieu of Lord Northcliffe) and attended by, among others, French ambassador <a href="Paul%20Cambon">Paul Cambon</a>. Grahame-White was given a consolation prize of an inscribed white-silver bowl, filled with red and white roses.
The events of 27–28 April constituted the world's first long-distance air race, and also marked the first night-time take-off of a heavier-than-air machine; Grahame-White's decision proved that night-time take-off, flight and navigation were possible, provided that the pilot was able to relate his position to the ground. Grahame-White did this with the help of friends, one of whom shone his car's headlamps onto the wall of a <a href="public%20house">public house</a>. Paulhan's arrival in Didsbury was notable for being the first powered flight into Manchester from any point outside the city. His achievement is commemorated by a <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a>, fixed to the front wall of 25–27 Paulhan Road, a pair of 1930s semi-detached houses near the site of his landing.

Within weeks of Paulhan's victory, the "Daily Mail" offered a new prize; £10,000 to the first aviator to cover a 1,000-mile (1,609-km) circuit of Britain in a single day, with 11 compulsory stops at fixed intervals. The challenge was completed by M Beaumont on 26 July 1911, in about 22½ hours. Paulhan and Grahame-White competed again later in 1910, for the newspaper's prize of £1,000 for the greatest aggregate cross-country flight, which Paulhan won.

The flight's 25th anniversary was celebrated at the Aero Club of France, in Paris, on 16 January 1936. Present at the banquet were Paulhan and Grahame-White, along with the French Air Minister <a href="Victor%20Denain">Victor Denain</a>, Prince <a href="George%20Valentin%20Bibescu">George Valentin Bibescu</a> (President of the FAI), Harold Perrin, and a number of other notable dignitaries as well as early aviators and constructors such as Farman, Voisin, <a href="Louis%20Charles%20Breguet">Breguet</a>, <a href="Caudron">Caudron</a>, Bleriot and Anzani.

Although by then retired from flying, on 28 April 1950—the fortieth anniversary of the 1910 flight—Paulhan repeated the journey from London to Manchester, this time as a passenger on board a <a href="Gloster%20Meteor">Gloster Meteor</a> T7, the two-seater training variant of the first British jet fighter. After travelling at 400 mph (644 km/h), the 67-year-old Frenchman said ""C'était magnifique" ... It was all I ever dreamed of in aviation—no propellers, no vibration." The "Daily Mail" entertained him at the Royal Aero Club in London, where he was accompanied by his former rival, Claude Grahame-White.

Maya (M.I.A. album)

Maya (stylised as ΛΛ Λ Y Λ) is the third studio album by English-Sri Lankan recording artist <a href="M.I.A.%20%28rapper%29">M.I.A.</a>, released on 7 July 2010 on her own label, <a href="N.E.E.T.%20Recordings">N.E.E.T. Recordings</a>, through <a href="XL%20Recordings">XL Recordings</a> and <a href="Interscope%20Records">Interscope Records</a>. Songwriting and production for the album were primarily handled by M.I.A., <a href="Blaqstarr">Blaqstarr</a> and <a href="Rusko%20%28musician%29">Rusko</a>. M.I.A.'s long-time associates <a href="Diplo%20%28DJ%29">Diplo</a>, <a href="Switch%20%28house%20DJ%29">Switch</a> and her brother Sugu Arulpragasam also worked on the album, which was mainly composed and recorded at M.I.A.'s house in Los Angeles.

The album's tracks centre on the theme of information politics and are intended to evoke what M.I.A. called a "digital <a href="wiktionary%3Aruckus">ruckus</a>". Elements of <a href="industrial%20music">industrial music</a> were incorporated into M.I.A.'s sound for the first time. A deluxe edition was released simultaneously, featuring four bonus tracks. Critics' opinions of the album were generally favourable although divided, with both its musical style and lyrical content each attracting praise and criticism. In its first week of release, the album entered the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a> at number 21, becoming her highest-charting album in the UK. It also became her highest-charting album in the US, reaching number nine on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, and debuted in the top 10 in Finland, Norway, Greece and Canada.

M.I.A. promoted the album by releasing a series of tracks online, including "<a href="XXXO">XXXO</a>", "<a href="It%20Takes%20a%20Muscle">It Takes a Muscle</a>" and "<a href="Born%20Free%20%28M.I.A.%20song%29">Born Free</a>", which was accompanied by a <a href="Born%20Free%20%28music%20video%29">short film-music video</a>, which generated controversy due to its graphic imagery. She also performed at music festivals in the US and Europe to coincide with the album's release. During her promotion of the album, she became embroiled in a dispute with Lynn Hirschberg of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>".

English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi "Maya" Arulpragasam) released her second album "<a href="Kala%20%28album%29">Kala</a>" in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified <a href="RIAA%20certification">gold</a> in the United States and <a href="British%20Phonographic%20Industry">silver</a> in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer <a href="Korg%20Kaossilator">Korg Kaossilator</a> to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop <a href="Maya%20civilization">Mayan</a> pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a "commune environment", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer <a href="Blaqstarr">Blaqstarr</a> because, in her opinion, "he simply makes good music". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of <a href="Sleigh%20Bells%20%28band%29">Sleigh Bells</a> on the track "Meds and Feds" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album "<a href="Treats%20%28album%29">Treats</a>."

Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown <a href="Rusko%20%28musician%29">Rusko</a> grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. <a href="Diplo%20%28DJ%29">Diplo</a> worked on the track "<a href="Tell%20Me%20Why%20%28M.I.A.%20song%29">Tell Me Why</a>", but at a studio in <a href="Santa%20Monica">Santa Monica</a> rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because "her boyfriend really hates me".

Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting "carried away" in the studio, appreciating the "mad distorted and hectic" sound they were able to create. Rusko said "She's got a kid, a little one year old baby, and we recorded his heart beat. We'd just think of crazy ideas". Rusko has described M.I.A. as the best artist he has ever worked with, saying that she had "been the most creative and I really had a good time making music with her".

M.I.A. called the new project "schizophrenic", and spoke of the Internet inspiration that could be found in the songs and the artwork. She also said that the album centred on her "not being able to leave [Los Angeles] for 18 months" and feeling "disconnected". She summed up the album's main theme as information politics. During the recording of the album, she spoke of the combined effects that news corporations and <a href="Google">Google</a> have on news and data collection, while stressing the need for alternative news sources that she felt her son's generation would need to ascertain truth. "Maya" was made to be "so uncomfortably weird and wrong that people begin to exercise their critical-thinking muscles". M.I.A. said "You can Google 'Sri Lanka' and it doesn't come up that all these people have been murdered or bombed, it's 'Come to Sri Lanka on vacation, there are beautiful beaches' ... you're not gonna get the truth till you hit like, page 56, and it's my and your responsibility to pass on the information that it's not easy anymore". Following these comments, M.I.A. received death threats directed at her and her son, which she also cited as an influence on the songs on the album. She summed up the album as a mixture of "babies, death, destruction and powerlessness". The singer revealed that going into recording the album, she had still not accepted that she was a musician, saying "I'm still in denial, listening to too much <a href="Destiny%27s%20Child">Destiny's Child</a>". With "Maya", she stated "I was happy being the retarded cousin of rap... Now I'm the retarded cousin of singing."
M.I.A. opted to sing, as opposed to rap, on several tracks on the album, telling "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" in early 2010 that she wished to produce something different from her previous album, which had "more emphasis on production". In a January 2010 interview with "<a href="NME">NME</a>" she spoke of being inspired by the film "<a href="Food%2C%20Inc.">Food, Inc.</a>" and described the album as being about "exploring our faults and flaws" and being proud of them. The closing track, "<a href="Space%20%28M.I.A.%20song%29">Space</a>", which was reportedly recorded using an <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a> app, is a ballad which Mikael Wood, writing in "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>", described as "dreamy" and "sound[ing] like a <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a> practicing its pillow talk". In contrast, Greg Kot of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" described "Lovalot" as sounding "like it was recorded in a dank alley, the singer's voice reverberating amid percussion that sounds like doors creaking and rats scurrying across garbage cans". "<a href="XXXO">XXXO</a>" draws its inspiration from M.I.A.'s "cheesy pop side", and is based on the theme of the creation of a sex symbol. "<a href="Teqkilla">Teqkilla</a>" is the only track to address her relationship with Bronfman, through a reference to <a href="Seagram">Seagram</a>, the company owned by his family. "<a href="It%20Takes%20a%20Muscle">It Takes a Muscle</a>" is a <a href="cover%20version">cover version</a> of a track originally recorded in 1982 by Dutch group Spectral Display, and is performed in a <a href="reggae">reggae</a> style.

The opening track "The Message", featuring a male lead vocalist, parodies the words of the traditional song "<a href="Dem%20Bones">Dem Bones</a>" to link <a href="Google">Google</a> to "the government". <a href="Kitty%20Empire">Kitty Empire</a> wrote in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" that these conspiratorial government connections to Google and the thoughts of <a href="Dzhennet%20Abdurakhmanova">Dzhennet Abdurakhmanova</a>, the Russian teenager who bombed Moscow's tube system in revenge for the death of her husband, were inner-world issues pondered in "Lovalot" with "a mixture of nonsense rhyme, militant posturing and pop-cultural free-flow; her London glottal stop mischievously turns 'I love a lot' into 'I love Allah' ". <a href="Ann%20Powers">Ann Powers</a> in the "Los Angeles Times" said that "M.I.A. turns a call to action into a scared girl's nervous tic. Synths click out a jittery, jagged background. The song doesn't justify anything, but it reminds us that there is a person behind every lit fuse". Powers also commented on how "<a href="Born%20Free%20%28M.I.A.%20song%29">Born Free</a>" mixed the boasting style often found in <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop music</a> with lines depicting the lives of those enduring poverty and persecution. "Illygirl", a track found only on the deluxe edition of the album, is written from the point of view of an abused but tough teenager, whom critic <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> said could be the "kid-sister-in-metaphor" of the swaggering persona adopted by M.I.A. on the track "<a href="Steppin%20Up">Steppin Up</a>".

<a href="Sample%20%28music%29">Samples</a> used on the album were taken from artists as diverse as the <a href="electronic%20music">electronic</a> duo <a href="Suicide%20%28band%29">Suicide</a> and <a href="gospel%20music">gospel</a> choir the <a href="Alabama%20Sacred%20Harp%20Singers">Alabama Sacred Harp Singers</a>. "<a href="Internet%20Connection">Internet Connection</a>", one of four bonus tracks on the deluxe edition of the album, was recorded in collaboration with a group of Filipino <a href="Verizon">Verizon</a> workers. M.I.A. described the sound and imagery of the album as capturing a "digital ruckus", adding that "so many of us have become typists and <a href="voyeur">voyeur</a>s". We need a digital moshpit like we've never seen, harder than how people were doing it in the <a href="Punk%20subculture">punk era</a>. We need that energy, but digitally". M.I.A. herself picked out "Steppin Up", "Space" and "Teqkilla" as her favourite tracks on the album. She said that she contemplated using only the sound of drills as the backing for "Steppin Up", but concluded that this was "too experimental" an approach.

According to Jim Farber of "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">New York Daily News</a>", "Maya" is an <a href="avant-pop">avant-pop</a> album that takes influence from "the most maddeningly catchy bits of <a href="Electroclash">electro-clash</a>, <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">hip-hop</a>, <a href="Music%20of%20Bollywood">Bollywood</a>, <a href="Dub%20music">dub</a> and <a href="dance%20music">dance music</a>". Farber also noted the significant <a href="industrial%20rock">industrial rock</a> influence on the album, likening it to "the late-'80s work of <a href="Ministry%20%28band%29">Ministry</a>". Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of "<a href="The%20Fader">The Fader</a>" commented on the increasingly <a href="industrial%20music">industrial</a> feel of the tracks made available prior to the album's release, a style which had not previously been incorporated into her music. On a similar note, Michael Saba of <a href="Paste%20%28magazine%29">"Paste"</a> believed the album was "a collection of sparse, industrial-influenced tracks that sound more like post-apocalyptic <a href="Nine%20Inch%20Nails">Nine Inch Nails</a> than Arulpragasam’s trademark <a href="realpolitik">realpolitik</a> rap".

The album was originally set to be released on 29 June 2010, but in May M.I.A.'s record label announced a new release date of 13 July. In late April, the artist posted a <a href="twitpic">twitpic</a> of the track listing for the new album. She also commented that at the time she was "open to suggestions" regarding the album's title. Two weeks later, a blog posting on her record label's official website revealed that the album would be entitled "/\/\/\Y/\", the punctuation marks spelling "Maya", M.I.A.'s own forename. The title follows on from previous albums named after her father (2005's "<a href="Arular">Arular</a>") and mother (2007's "<a href="Kala%20%28album%29">Kala</a>"). Some reviewers used the stylised title while others did not. M.I.A.'s official Myspace page uses both titles. The album was released in conventional physical and digital formats and as an <a href="iTunes%20LP">iTunes LP</a>.

The album's cover features the singer's face almost completely hidden by <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> player bars. MTV's Kyle Anderson described the cover, which was previewed in June 2010, as "a typically busy, trippy, disorienting piece of art" and speculated that it might be "a statement about 21st century privacy". Additional art direction for the album was provided by Aaron Parsons. M.I.A. used her mother's Tamil phonebook to find a wedding photographer to provide images for the album. Photographers for the album were Ravi Thiagaraja, M.I.A. and Jamie Martinez. Elements of the artwork had previously been used in one of a series of billboard images, all designed by musicians, which were projected onto landmarks in London by a guerrilla project called BillBored during the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202010">2010 British general election</a>. The deluxe edition of the album features a <a href="lenticular%20printing">lenticular</a> slipcase. Music website Prefix listed it as one of the 10 worst album covers of 2010, likening it to a "child's first computer-class-assignment".

When questioned about the difficulty of finding her album title on search engines such as <a href="Google">Google</a>, she noted that she chose to use forward slashes and backward slashes due to their ease at being typed and because she liked the way the album title looked on music players such as <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a>. She also suggested that it was a deliberate attempt to avoid detection by internet search engines. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" Sian Rowe commented that M.I.A.'s deliberate "shrinking away from a mainstream audience" by the use of difficult, unsearchable symbols was part of a growing new underground scene perhaps trying to create a "generation gap", where only "the youngest and the most enthusiastic" would seek out such band names by reading the right online sources.

On 12 January 2010, M.I.A. posted a video clip on Twitter, which featured a new song, but revealed no information about it other than the heading "Theres space for ol dat I see" "(sic)". The following day her publicist confirmed that the track was entitled "Space Odyssey" and had been produced in collaboration with <a href="Rusko%20%28musician%29">Rusko</a> to protest a travel piece about Sri Lanka printed in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>". The track made it onto the final album under the revised title "Space". The same month, she filmed a <a href="Born%20Free%20%28music%20video%29">short film</a> for the song "<a href="Born%20Free%20%28M.I.A.%20song%29">Born Free</a>". At the end of April the track was released as a promotional single, and the short film accompanying the song was released. The film, directed by <a href="Romain%20Gavras">Romain Gavras</a>, depicts a military unit rounding up red-headed young men who are then shot or forced to run across a minefield. The film, which also features nudity and scenes of drug use, caused widespread controversy and was either removed or labelled with an age restriction on YouTube. In the weeks following the release of the film, M.I.A. was the most blogged about artist on the Internet, according to MP3 blog aggregator <a href="The%20Hype%20Machine">The Hype Machine</a>. M.I.A. found the controversy "ridiculous", saying that videos of real-life executions had not generated as much controversy as her video. In the run-up to the album's release, "<a href="XXXO">XXXO</a>", which "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" described as the "first official single" from the forthcoming album, "Steppin Up", "Teqkilla" and "It Takes a Muscle" were released online. On 6 July 2010 she made the entire album available via her Myspace page. On 20 September, "Story To Be Told" received a video, on its own website, featuring the song's lyrics in <a href="CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a> formatting. In December, "It Takes a Muscle" was released as a two-track promotional single.
The new album was publicised during <a href="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a>'s performance at the <a href="Coachella%20Valley%20Music%20and%20Arts%20Festival">Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival</a> in April, when a blimp flew across the venue announcing that M.I.A.'s new album would be released on 29 June 2010. M.I.A. promoted the album with a series of appearances at music festivals, including the <a href="HARD%20%28music%20festival%29">Hard festival</a> in New York and <a href="The%20Big%20Chill%20%28music%20festival%29">The Big Chill</a> in Herefordshire. Her performance at the latter was cut short due to a stage invasion by fans. She also performed at the Flow Festival in Finland, where she was joined onstage by <a href="Sleigh%20Bells%20%28band%29">Derek E. Miller</a> playing guitar during her performance of "Meds and Feds", and the LokerseFeesten in <a href="Lokeren">Lokeren</a>, Flanders, Belgium, where her performance drew a crowd of 13,500, the biggest of the 10-day music festival. In September she announced a tour that would last until the end of the year.

M.I.A. also promoted the album with an appearance on the "<a href="Late%20Show%20with%20David%20Letterman">Late Show with David Letterman</a>", during which she performed "Born Free" with <a href="Martin%20Rev">Martin Rev</a> of <a href="Suicide%20%28band%29">Suicide</a> playing keyboards, backed by a group of dancers styled to look like M.I.A. In November 2010 she appeared on the British television show "<a href="Later...%20with%20Jools%20Holland">Later... with Jools Holland</a>", performing "Born Free" and "It Takes a Muscle", the latter with members of <a href="The%20Specials">The Specials</a>. While promoting the album, M.I.A. became involved in a dispute with Lynn Hirschberg of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", who interviewed her in March 2010 and whose resulting article portrayed the singer as pretentious and attention seeking. In response, M.I.A. posted Hirschberg's telephone number on her Twitter page and later uploaded her own audio recording of the interview, highlighting the discrepancies between what she said and what was reported. The piece was criticised for its <a href="yellow%20journalism">yellow journalism</a> by some, however M.I.A. received varying degrees of support and criticism for the ensuing fallout from the media. Benjamin Boles wrote in "<a href="Now%20%28newspaper%29">Now</a>" that, while Hirschberg's piece came across as a "vicious ... character assassination", M.I.A's subsequent actions were "childish" and made her "the laughing stock of the internet". The paper later printed a correction on the story, acknowledging that some quotes had been taken out of context. The incident prompted <a href="Boots%20Riley">Boots Riley</a> of the band <a href="Street%20Sweeper%20Social%20Club">Street Sweeper Social Club</a> to comment on how artists had access to media that allowed writers to be held accountable and that M.I.A.'s move was "brilliant".

"Maya" received moderately positive reviews from critics. Simon Vozick-Levinson of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" called the album "surely the year's most divisive major-label release". At <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which assigns a <a href="Standard%20score">normalised</a> rating out of 100 based on reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an <a href="Weighted%20mean">average</a> score of 68 based on 41 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews". Reviews of the album began to appear a month before its release after the album leaked in low quality onto the internet. Charles Aaron, writing in "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>", gave the album four and a half out of five stars, his review deeming the song "Lovalot" her "riskiest gambit yet". Matthew Bennett of "<a href="Clash%20%28magazine%29">Clash</a>" gave a similar score, calling it a "towering work". "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>" writer Roy Wilkinson called it a "startling fusillade of to-the-moon pop music". Writing for the <a href="BBC%20Online">BBC Online</a>, Matthew Bennett characterised the album as "loud, proud, and taking no prisoners" and also praised the album's lighter tracks, such as "Teqkilla", which he called "enjoyably demented but utterly catchy". "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" writer Rob Sheffield said the album was M.I.A.'s "most aggressive, confrontational and passionate yet", praising her "voracious ear for alarms, sirens, explosions, turning every jolt into a breakbeat" and her consequent lyrics as "expansive". "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" writer Ann Powers commended the album as "an attempt by an artist who's defined herself through opposition to engage with the system that she has entered, for better or worse, and to still remain recognizable to herself" characterising "Maya"s foregrounded ideas as "a struggle worthy of a revolutionary". In his consumer guide for <a href="MSN%20Music">MSN Music</a>, critic <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> gave the album an A rating and complimented its "beats and the spunky, shape-shifting, stubbornly political, nouveau riche bundle of nerves who holds them together".

Other critics were not as complimentary towards the album. Charlotte Heathcote of British newspaper the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" said that, while M.I.A. could "still lay claim to being one of our most imaginative, uncompromising artists", there were "only glimmers of brilliance" on the album. "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" writer <a href="Greg%20Kot">Greg Kot</a> gave the album two and a half out of four stars and expressed a mixed response towards M.I.A.'s "[embracing] pop more fervently than ever. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"s Leah Greenblatt was critical of the album, stating that it sounded "murky and almost punishingly discordant, as if the album has been submerged underwater and then set upon by an arsenal of exceptionally peeved power tools". She went on to state that nothing on the album sounded "truly vital", or as revolutionary as M.I.A. wanted the public to believe. Stephen Troussé, writing in "<a href="Uncut%20%28magazine%29">Uncut</a>", described the album as "anti-climactic" and "self-satisfied" and said that it suffered from "diminished horizons". Mehan Jayasuriya of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> noted M.I.A.'s "self-aggrandizing" as a weakness, adding that "Maya" lacks "the focus and confidence of M.I.A.'s previous albums". Jesse Cataldo of <a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a> noted that the album "has the feel of a vanity project" and wrote "It may be an above-average album, but its aesthetic matches her persona only at its shallowest levels, in the thinness of its ideas and the often-forceful ugliness of its message". Chris Richard of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" called it "a disorienting mix of industrial clatter and digital slush" and noted "there isn't much to sing along to".

In December 2010, the "<a href="NME">NME</a>" named "XXXO" and "Born Free" the number two and number 11 best tracks of the year respectively. "Maya" appeared in a number of magazines' lists of the best albums of the year. The album was placed at number five on the "2010 <a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork</a> Readers Poll" list of the "Most Underrated Album" of the year. "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" placed "Maya" at number eight in its list of the best releases of 2010, and "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" listed it at number 19 in its countdown.

"Maya" debuted at number 21 on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a> on first-week sales of 7,138 copies, 18 places higher than the peak position achieved by "Kala", immediately making it M.I.A.'s highest-charting album in the UK. The following week it dropped out of the top 40. It also charted in a number of other European countries, reaching the top 10 in Finland, Greece and Norway. In the United States, it debuted at number nine on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, nine places higher than the peak position achieved by "Kala", although it sold only 28,000 copies in its first week of release, compared with the 29,000 which the earlier album sold in the same period. "Maya" fell to number 34 in its second week on the chart, selling 11,000 copies. As of September 2013, the album had sold 99,000 copies in the US. The album also topped "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>"s <a href="Dance/Electronic%20Albums">Dance/Electronic Albums</a> chart and reached the top five on two of the magazine's other charts. "Maya" also entered the top 10 on the <a href="Canadian%20Albums%20Chart">Canadian Albums Chart</a>. The single "<a href="XXXO">XXXO</a>" reached the top 40 in Spain and the UK, and "Teqkilla" reached number 93 on the <a href="Canadian%20Hot%20100">Canadian Hot 100</a> on digital downloads alone.

Divisional Cavalry Regiment (New Zealand)

The Divisional Cavalry Regiment (Div Cav), was an <a href="armoured%20cavalry">armoured cavalry</a> <a href="Regiment%23Commonwealth%20armies">regiment</a> of the <a href="2nd%20New%20Zealand%20Division">2nd New Zealand Division</a> during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> and was New Zealand's first armoured unit. It served as a <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> force for the 2nd New Zealand Division. Formed on 29 September 1939, the regiment embarked for <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Egypt</a> on 4 January 1940. It fought with the division, as part of the <a href="2nd%20New%20Zealand%20Expeditionary%20Force">2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force</a>, in <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Crete">Crete</a>, <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North Africa</a> and <a href="Italian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Italy</a>. The regiment formed part of <a href="J%20Force">J Force</a>, New Zealand's contribution to the <a href="occupation%20of%20Japan">occupation of Japan</a> at the end of the war.

Initially stationed at <a href="Maadi">Maadi</a>, the regiment was moved to Garawla in July and participated in the defence of the <a href="Baggush%20Box">Baggush Box</a> two months later. In January 1941, it moved to <a href="Helwan">Helwan</a> for training. In March, the regiment became part of W Force, the British contingent sent to Greece to defend the country from <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. It took up positions on the <a href="Aliakmon">Aliakmon Line</a> before the regiment was scattered during the British retreat from the country. Most of the regiment ended up in Crete, where it faced a German paratroop attack in May and evacuated with the remainder of the British force.

After spending several months re-equipping, Div Cav fought in <a href="Operation%20Crusader">Operation Crusader</a> and was the first unit to enter <a href="Bardia">Bardia</a> in January 1942. After returning to Maadi, the regiment was sent to <a href="Syria%E2%80%93Lebanon%20Campaign">Syria</a> with the 2nd New Zealand Division to prevent an <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> attack from <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> and was sent back to Egypt after the British rout in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gazala">Battle of Gazala</a>. It fought at the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">first</a> and <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">second</a> battles of El Alamein and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alam%20el%20Halfa">Battle of Alam el Halfa</a>. The regiment pursued retreating German troops and fought at the <a href="Battle%20of%20El%20Agheila">Battle of El Agheila</a>. In January 1943 it was based at <a href="Castel%20Benito">Castel Benito</a>, and participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Mareth%20Line">Battle of the Mareth Line</a> in March. After the German surrender in <a href="Tunisian%20Campaign">Tunisia</a> on 13 May, the regiment moved back to Maadi for refitting.

In September the regiment was sent to Italy with the rest of the division and fought in the <a href="Moro%20River%20Campaign">Moro River Campaign</a> on the Adriatic coast in December. The division fought in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Monte%20Cassino">Battle of Monte Cassino</a>, for which Div Cav provided support. The regiment then participated in the drive on the <a href="Gothic%20Line">Gothic Line</a>, where elements entered <a href="Florence">Florence</a> in August. In October it was reorganised as the Divisional Cavalry Battalion, an <a href="infantry">infantry</a> unit, because its armoured cars were unsuitable for Italian terrain. The <a href="battalion">battalion</a> fought in the final Allied offensive in Italy, <a href="Operation%20Grapeshot">Operation Grapeshot</a>, during early 1945. It reached <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> in the first week of May and was stationed there until February 1946. That month the Divisional Cavalry deployed to Japan, once again as a regiment. Stationed in southern <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a>, it was disbanded on 1 September 1947.
After the beginning of the Second World War, the government of New Zealand authorised the formation of the <a href="2nd%20New%20Zealand%20Expeditionary%20Force">2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force</a> (2 NZEF). Following discussions with the British government, it was decided that New Zealand's contribution to the war would be an infantry division, the <a href="2nd%20New%20Zealand%20Division">2nd New Zealand Division</a>. The Divisional Cavalry Regiment was formed to provide a reconnaissance force for the division. It was New Zealand's first armoured unit. 

The regiment was mobilised as part of 2 NZEF in September 1939 and was issued with six <a href="Bren%20Gun%20Carrier">Bren gun carriers</a>. It had a headquarters, a headquarters squadron and a machine-gun squadron; the structure was soon changed to conform with that of the British Divisional Cavalry Regiments, which included three fighting squadrons and a headquarters squadron. The regiment was established from 27 to 30 September at <a href="Ngaruawahia">Ngaruawahia</a> Military Camp, except for No. 3 Squadron (later C Squadron), which was formed at <a href="Narrow%20Neck%2C%20New%20Zealand">Narrow Neck</a>. It was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Caro Pierce, a <a href="Military%20history%20of%20New%20Zealand%20in%20World%20War%20I">World War I</a> veteran and <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> recipient. The squadrons at Ngaruawahia were visited by <a href="Governor-General%20of%20New%20Zealand">Governor-General</a> <a href="George%20Monckton-Arundell%2C%208th%20Viscount%20Galway">George Galway</a> on 30 November. A special march through Auckland Domain was held on 3 January; the next day, the regiment (except for C Squadron) embarked for Egypt aboard the troopship <a href="RMS%20Rangitata">RMS "Rangitata"</a>. They arrived at <a href="Port%20Tewfik">Port Tewfik</a> on 13 February. The regiment disembarked the following day and entrained for the New Zealand base camp at <a href="Maadi">Maadi</a>, the central depot and training area for 2 NZEF in the Middle East. In March, twelve Bren gun carriers and five <a href="Light%20Tank%20Mark%20III">Light Tanks Mark III</a> arrived, and tank-gunnery training began on the range at <a href="Abbassia">Abbassia</a>; the regiment participated in brigade manoeuvres at El Saff the following month. On 19 June, the regiment experienced its first fatality when Trooper Vincent Thompson died of <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a>.

C Squadron completed its training in New Zealand and was attached to the Second Echelon of the 2 NZEF, in adherence with plans to send one squadron of the regiment to Egypt with the Second Echelon. The squadron was diverted to Britain, while en route to Egypt, when Italy entered the war, and arrived on 16 June. The squadron was based near <a href="Aldershot">Aldershot</a> and conducted further training there. C Squadron became part of the Second Echelon's Headquarters Covering Force, defending Britain against German invasion. In early September, the squadron was moved to <a href="Westwell%2C%20Kent">Westwell, Kent</a>; it underwent further training and was sent back to Aldershot in November. C Squadron left Britain for Egypt on 4 January 1941.

In July 1940, the 2nd New Zealand Division was sent to <a href="Mersa%20Matruh">Mersa Matruh</a>. The cavalry regiment, camped at Garawla, dug the outer anti-tank ditch along the <a href="Wadi">Wadi</a> Naghamish (later known as the Kiwi Canal). That month, volunteers from the regiment joined the <a href="Long%20Range%20Desert%20Group">Long Range Desert Patrol</a>, and the regiment's base came under air attack. In the pre-dawn darkness of 15 July, Italian bombers attempting to bomb the <a href="NAAFI">NAAFI</a> dump were driven off by anti-aircraft fire from the regiment. During the night of 18 July, regimental anti-aircraft guns mistakenly fired on a damaged <a href="Bristol%20Blenheim">Bristol Blenheim</a>. The regiment received orders to move to Baggush and build fortifications, completing the move on 1 September; the following day, it began constructing defences at Maaten Baggush. After finishing the task within a week, it was transferred to the rear area at <a href="RAF%20El%20Daba">El Daba</a>. The regiment defended No. 2 sector of the <a href="Baggush%20Box">Baggush Box</a>. After <a href="Operation%20Compass">Operation Compass</a>, the Allied offensive against Italian positions in Egypt and Libya, began on 9 December, several Italian <a href="Fiat%20M11/39">Fiat M11/39</a> tanks were left behind at Nibeiwa. The regiment was ordered to salvage the tanks and on 15 December, Lieutenant H. A. Robinson led a party of 25 other ranks to Nibeiwa for the task. Div Cav received <a href="Marmon-Herrington%20Armoured%20Car">Marmon-Herrington Armoured Car</a>s, replacing its obsolete <a href="Light%20Tank%20Mk%20II">Light Tanks Mk II</a> and <a href="Light%20Tank%20Mk%20III">Mk III</a>, and was transferred to <a href="Helwan">Helwan</a> in January 1941. The mortally ill Pierce was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Carruth on 22 February and C Squadron joined the regiment at Helwan on 5 March.
In early March 1941, the 2nd New Zealand Division (including Div Cav) was earmarked for W Force, the British Commonwealth force sent to Greece to bolster its defence <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">against imminent German invasion</a>. The regiment embarked for Greece on 18 March 1941 on the Greek ship "Ionia", with its vehicles aboard the cargo ship "Anglo-Canadian". The ships arrived at <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> on 21 March and the troops stayed at the transit camp at <a href="Kifisia">Kifisia</a>. The regiment advanced northward, reaching its position on the Aliakmon Line near <a href="Katerini">Katerini</a> on 26 March. Its mission was to destroy the <a href="Aliakmon%20River">Aliakmon River</a> bridges, delaying the German advance. E Troop of the 5th Field Regiment and O Troop of the 7th Anti-Tank Regiment were attached to the regiment. On 4 April, the regiment sent two troops of Marmon-Harrington armoured cars to reinforce the British <a href="1st%20Armoured%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Armoured Brigade</a> on the Macedonian plain; in exchange, the regiment received seven cruiser tanks. The two troops withdrew with the 1st Armoured Brigade when it retreated on 8 April and reached <a href="Perdikkas%2C%20Kozani">Perdikkas</a> by the following day. The regiment and E Troop, 5th Field Regiment, were the only units left on the plain between <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a> and the Aliakmon on 8 April. The next day, A Squadron demolished the main bridge across the Aliakmon, after the 1st Armoured Brigade had withdrawn southward.

German forces reached the regimental positions on 12 April; the following day, their attempts to cross the river in assault boats were repulsed. During the evening, the regiment disengaged and fell back to <a href="Kolindros">Kolindros</a>; it was attacked by German tanks and infantry on 14 April. <a href="Boys%20anti-tank%20rifle">Boys anti-tank rifle</a>s were useless against the German tanks, although Bren gun fire was effective against the German infantry. When its positions were flanked by tanks, the regiment retreated to Olympus Pass and was ordered to take up positions at <a href="Deskati">Deskati</a> Pass as a <a href="rearguard">rearguard</a>. The pass, a possible withdrawal route for the 1st Armoured Brigade, was reached on 15 April. On the 17th, division commander Major General <a href="Bernard%20Freyberg%2C%201st%20Baron%20Freyberg">Bernard Freyberg</a> dispersed the regiment to screen the rear of his retreating troops. The next day, A and C Squadrons withdrew from Olympus Pass and <a href="Palaio%20Eleftherochori">Eleftherochorion</a> after a German tank attack. B Squadron fought a rearguard action at <a href="Vale%20of%20Tempe">Tempe</a>, retreating down the <a href="Volos">Volos</a> road and losing several carriers.

The regiment, reunited on the Volos road, retreated to the <a href="Thermopylae">Thermopylae</a> Line. On 21 April it was ordered to patrol <a href="Euboea">Euboea</a> but its vehicles were too badly damaged to do so. The regiment, less A Squadron, was instructed instead to screen <a href="Erythres">Kriekouki</a> under Lieutenant Colonel Clifton, to cover the retreat of the <a href="4th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28New%20Zealand%29">4th NZ Brigade</a>; A Squadron was detached to screen the withdrawal of the 1st Armoured Brigade at <a href="Chalkis">Chalkis</a>. By the evening of 25 April, Div Cav had fulfilled its mission and retreated beyond the village of Mazi. In the evening, Div Cav was ordered to guard the <a href="Corinth%20Canal">Corinth Canal</a> bridge; A Squadron retreated with the 1st Armoured Brigade to <a href="Malakasa">Malakasa</a>. A and B Squadrons retreated to <a href="Rafina">Rafina Beach</a>, embarking on the supply ship . One hundred and fifty men from the regiment were left behind and were taken out by on the night of 27 April. C Squadron, caught in the German paratroop attack on Corinth, was forced to abandon its vehicles. It marched to <a href="Nafplion">Nafplion</a> for embarkation but the ship they were scheduled to board was full and the squadron instead set off for Crete in <a href="ca%C3%AFque">caïque</a>s.

The evacuation of Greece divided the regiment: regimental headquarters and most of HQ Squadron were sent to Egypt and most of the other three squadrons remained on Crete. A total of 194 soldiers from the regiment were on the island, with several wounded men evacuated to Egypt; A, B and C Squadrons trained and re-equipped. The troops of the regiment on the island, commanded by Major J. T. Russell and renamed Russell Force, joined the ad-hoc <a href="10th%20Brigade%20%28New%20Zealand%29">10th NZ Brigade</a> under newly promoted Acting Colonel <a href="Howard%20Kippenberger">Howard Kippenberger</a> and was positioned on the road from <a href="Chania">Chania</a> to <a href="Alikianos">Alikianos</a>. Russell Force was moved to <a href="Agia%2C%20Chania">Aghya</a> in early May 1941.

German paratroops <a href="Battle%20of%20Crete">attacked Crete</a> on 20 May. Many paratroopers landed near the Div Cav positions and were beaten back. Cut off from the 10th Brigade headquarters, Russell followed Kippenberger's orders and withdrew to Galatas in Chania, to reinforce a Greek unit south of the village. At dusk, the regiment dug in near a stone wall. B Squadron held the right flank and C Squadron the centre; A Squadron and the <a href="19th%20Battalion%20%28New%20Zealand%29">19th Battalion</a> held the left, with the Greek unit in reserve.

The brigade was strafed by German aircraft on the morning of 21 May. The 19th Battalion (supported by C Squadron and light tanks from the <a href="3rd%20Hussars">3rd Hussars</a>) assaulted Cemetery Hill, where two German machine guns threatened A and C Squadrons and part of the battalion. Although the Germans were driven off, the battalion could not hold under heavy mortar fire and withdrew; Cemetery Hill became a <a href="no%20man%27s%20land">no man's land</a>. On 25 May, heavy German attacks drove British forces from Wheat Hill and exposed the centre of the <a href="18th%20Battalion%20%28New%20Zealand%29">18th Battalion</a>, which withdrew through Galatas. The right flank of Div Cav and the Petrol Company, acting as infantry, was exposed and the <a href="23rd%20Battalion%20%28New%20Zealand%29">23rd Battalion</a> counter-attacked and retook Galatas at dusk, withdrawing during the night. That night Div Cav retreated to Church Hill, behind the 19th Battalion. At 01:00 on 26 May the regiment joined remnants of the <a href="21st%20Battalion%20%28New%20Zealand%29">21st Battalion</a> commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Allen on the main coast road between Chania and Galatas on Hellfire Hill.

The force retreated by night to a position near <a href="Suda%20Bay">Suda Bay</a>, where the 21st Battalion took up positions on <a href="Battle%20of%2042nd%20Street">42nd Street</a> with Div Cav in reserve. The regiment fell back to <a href="Stilos">Stilos</a>, arriving at 04:00 on 28 May and formed the extreme right of a defensive position, with the 23rd Battalion on the left. During the afternoon it was ordered to withdraw through <a href="Vryses">Vryses</a> towards <a href="Sphakia">Sphakia</a>. After reaching Sphakia on 31 May, the regiment was evacuated by to Egypt that night and during the early morning of 1 June. The regiment suffered a total of 130 casualties in Greece and Crete, including 61 captured and 17 killed.

On 3 June, the units of the regiment that had fought on Crete arrived at Helwan. Major Arthur Nicoll received a promotion to lieutenant colonel and succeeded Carruth after the latter took command of the Composite Training Depot on 26 July. Fourteen Bren Gun Carriers arrived on 22 August 1941 and replacements were trained. In early September, the regiment prepared to move into the <a href="Western%20Desert%20%28North%20Africa%29">Western Desert</a> to take part in the coming British offensive to raise the <a href="siege%20of%20Tobruk">siege of Tobruk</a>. An advance party, led by Major Russell, left Helwan on 14 September, and the regiment garrisoned the Baggush Box in September and October. In October, it received 26 <a href="Light%20Tank%20Mk%20VI">Light Tanks Mk VI</a>. During October, the regiment conducted maneuvers and training together with the 4 Infantry Brigade Group, using its new light tanks.

During <a href="Operation%20Crusader">Operation Crusader</a>, it was planned that the New Zealand Division would cross the Egyptian border north of and parallel to <a href="XXX%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XXX Corps</a> and would then advance northwards. The offensive was to begin on 17 November. Prior to the beginning of the offensive, the regiment screened the Egyptian border south of <a href="Trigh%20el%20Abd">Trigh el Abd</a> to detect any German advance in that sector. In early November, Div Cav left Baggush to begin its pre-offensive mission and took the main road to Mersa Matruh (Matruh). It then took the <a href="Siwa%20Oasis">Siwa</a> road past Matruh, moving south for an hour before swinging west into the desert. The regiment bivouacked at dusk and continued in stages the following day. Lieutenant Colonel Nicoll visited the <a href="4th%20Indian%20Division">4th Indian Division</a> headquarters on 9 November. Regimental Headquarters, B and C Squadrons were brought under command of the 4th Indian Division, advancing to <a href="Alam%20el%20Seneini">Alam el Seneini</a> the next day. A Squadron continued and was taken under the command of the <a href="4th%20South%20African%20Armoured%20Car%20Regiment">4th South African Armoured Car Regiment</a>, with the HQ Squadron behind along with the B Echelon of the South Africans. A troop of the 65th Anti-Tank Regiment and a troop of the 57th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment (57th LAA) were placed under Div Cav. The 57th LAA shot down an Italian aircraft at El Rabta on 14 November.

At dusk on 17 November, Regimental HQ and A Squadron advanced to <a href="El%20Beida">El Beida</a>; C Squadron bivouacked at El Rabta and B Squadron screened the <a href="7th%20Indian%20Infantry%20Brigade">7th Indian Infantry Brigade</a> as it advanced towards <a href="Bir%20Gibni">Bir Gibni</a>. C Squadron crossed the frontier towards Bir Gibni the following day, joined by Regimental Headquarters and A Squadron later in the morning. B Squadron patrolled the Indian brigade's flank near Bir Gibni and was fired on by German <a href="Panzer%20III">Panzer III</a> tanks. One Panzer III was disabled by 2-pounder anti-tank guns, and was towed away by a retreating Panzer. B Squadron pulled back a mile at night and <a href="laager">laager</a>ed. At 15:00 on 19 November, the regiment advanced towards Bir Gibni, with C Squadron forward and A Squadron in reserve. C Squadron reached the Trigh el Abd and observed the British <a href="4th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">4th Armoured Brigade</a> fighting a battle group from the <a href="21st%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">21st Panzer Division</a>. B Squadron was transferred back to regimental command late on 19 November, after providing flank support to the 7th Indian Brigade.

On the morning of 20 November, B Squadron patrolled in front of the 4th Indian Division and captured a German car and its passenger. C Squadron patrolled closer to Bir Gibni, observing the tank battles in that area. <a href="XIII%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XIII Corps</a> began driving north the following day; Div Cav advanced to Sidi Azeiz, capturing 49 Italians from the 52nd Anti-Aircraft Battery and six German and Italian artillerymen. After the engagement at Sidi Azeiz, the regiment formed a line at Bir ez Zemla. The 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade arrived the next day; the <a href="20th%20Battalion%20%28New%20Zealand%29">20th Battalion</a> attacked enemy positions, while C Squadron captured several Italian machine-gun posts. A Squadron captured three grounded German aircraft, taking prisoners, and B Squadron captured five ambulance cars with their drivers. On the evening of 22 November, the regimental line was taken over by units of the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade and C Squadron was transferred to the command of the 4th Infantry Brigade for its advance on Gambut; the rest of Div Cav moved to Sidi Azeiz.

C Squadron, leading a brigade group, advanced towards Gambut on the morning of 23 November. On the outskirts of Gambut, the line was stopped to allow the <a href="Matilda%20II">Matilda</a> tanks to lead the column. C Squadron was ordered to charge into Gambut, but when it became apparent that the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> was retreating, they pursued until the New Zealand infantry engaged and then withdrew to Gambut aerodrome. The following evening, the squadron screened the 4th Brigade Group and advanced westward before being recalled at dusk. On 25 November, C Squadron screened the brigade in its advance on <a href="Sidi%20Rezegh">Sidi Rezegh</a> and captured a number of German soldiers before being sent to guard divisional headquarters. Four <a href="Stuart%20tank">Stuart tank</a>s, captured from the British by the Germans and then recaptured, were given to C Squadron on the afternoon of 27 November.

The next day, the squadron patrolled the Sidi Rezegh and Gambut escarpments, driving off German tanks and infantry in the afternoon and incurring vehicle and crew losses. The German column turned north during the night, attacking the divisional headquarters from the east. The four Stuart tanks repulsed the assault; 2 and 5 Troops attempted to regain the New Zealand <a href="field%20hospital">field hospital</a>, which had been captured the night before. They withdrew, narrowly escaping encirclement by German tanks from the <a href="15th%20Panzer%20Division">15th Panzer Division</a>. When the remnants of the 21st Battalion were destroyed on <a href="Battle%20of%20Point%20175">Point 175</a>, the New Zealand Division rear was shelled. The Italian <a href="Ariete%20Armoured%20Division">Ariete Armoured Division</a> attacked on 30 November and were repulsed by the divisional artillery. During the afternoon, the 24th Battalion and most of the 26th were overrun by the 15th Panzer Division.

On 1 December, the Germans overran the 20th Battalion and split the 19th in half, cutting off the 18th Battalion. The remnants of the 6th New Zealand Infantry Brigade fell back through the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade to Zaafran and the Ed Duda corridor was closed. The division retreated, led along the Trigh Capuzzo by C Squadron, which halted at Bir Gibni at 04:00 on 2 December. At noon, the squadron headed north to rejoin the regiment.

B and C Squadrons were ordered to patrol Sidi Azeiz on 24 November, linking the 22nd and 23rd Battalion positions and screening the brigade against an expected German assault on 25 November. On the morning of 26 November, several German transport vehicles were captured when they ran into the B Squadron laager. The squadrons patrolled the line, capturing prisoners before withdrawing from a German attack on 27 November. After the brigade headquarters was captured, the regiment set off to join the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade at Sidi Omar Nuovo, moving to Bir Zemla to cut Bardia's communications from the west on 1–3 December. On 3 December, an Axis column approached; the regiment retreated, leading the Axis into an ambush by the <a href="Maori%20Battalion">28th Maori Battalion</a> and 22nd Infantry Battalion. C Squadron arrived on 6 December and the squadrons screened at Menastir. On 7 December, the regiment split into four mobile columns and moved west, discovering 29 tanks in a wadi near the coast. Two days later A and C Squadrons and three anti-tank gun batteries attacked the area, a tank-repair workshop, destroying the tanks and taking 30 prisoners.

From 10 to 16 December, the regiment established a chain of posts on the roads south of Bardia to prevent Axis movement. The <a href="2nd%20South%20African%20Division">2nd South African Division</a>, supported by A and C Squadrons, made an abortive attack on Bardia on 16 December; the 2nd South African battalions retreated two days later. The regiment participated in a deception operation, concealing the attack on Bardia with <a href="dummy%20tank">dummy tank</a>s in the desert. On 2 January 1942, Lieutenant E. W. Kerr of the regiment accepted the surrender of German General <a href="Artur%20Schmitt">Artur Schmitt</a>, commander of the Bardia garrison. C Squadron became the first Allied force to enter Bardia. HQ and B Squadrons entered Bardia after Kerr's troop, releasing Allied prisoners. On 6 January, the regiment left Bardia for Baggush, returning to Maadi on 26 January.

On 13 March, the New Zealand Division moved to Syria to build fortifications in the <a href="Beqaa%20Valley">Beqaa Valley</a>, to protect against the prospect of an Axis attack from Turkey. The regiment had to build roads at <a href="Laboue">Laboue</a> and <a href="Wadi%20al-Far%27a">Wadi Fa'rah</a>, camping at <a href="Djedeida">Djedeida</a>. In mid-May the road-building was finished and the regiment prepared for manoeuvres with the 4th and <a href="6th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28New%20Zealand%29">6th New Zealand Infantry Brigades</a>. On 21 May, the regiment moved into the desert for the manoeuvres. When the exercises were completed on 1 June, it returned to Djedeida for more training.

On 16 June, the Div Cav was ordered to move to Egypt with the rest of the division. The offensive by General <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a> had created a need for more troops to stop the Axis advance. The regiment arrived at Matruh ten days later, where it was to cover the northern and eastern parts of the minefields around the village. Div Cav was the last of the divisional units to arrive back in Egypt. When the division left Matruh on 26 June, the regiment's tanks and carriers had not yet arrived. B Squadron was equipped with carriers and transport available in Matruh and was sent ahead to Garawla, losing two carriers to tanks along the way and splitting up in the darkness. Half went to <a href="Minqar%20Qaim">Minqar Qaim</a>, where the 4th and 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigades were positioned, and the other half, led by Major Sutherland, laagered in a depression and was surrounded by German tanks. Sutherland's force broke out, losing one soldier who was taken prisoner. Arriving at headquarters at 08:00, he found the rest of the squadron. B Squadron was then sent to Bir Khalda to replace the 21st Battalion, patrolling there for the rest of the day. By evening the division was nearly surrounded, so acting division commander Brigadier Inglis decided on a breakout to Fortress A (also known as the Kaponga Box) south-west of El Alamein. B Squadron retreated south along the Qattara Depression before turning north to the fortress, rejoining the regiment on 30 June.

The remainder of Div Cav left Matruh for Fuka on 27 June, receiving new Bren Gun Carriers at Baggush. A Squadron prepared the new carriers for battle. After a report of approaching Axis tanks, the squadrons were withdrawn to Daba on 28 June and to Fortress A in the afternoon. On 30 June, the regiment screened west and south of the box. From 1 July, the regiment fought in the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">First Battle of El Alamein</a>. B Squadron was shelled on 1 July and withdrew to the Deir el Munassib. The regiment probed ahead of the box, engaging the Axis forces, and B Squadron lost a carrier to anti-tank guns on the Alam Nayil ridge. The Axis forces were halted by a New Zealand counter-attack led by Brigadier Weir. Alam Nayil was captured by Weir's force on 3 July and C Squadron held the ridge while Weir's force pressed ahead. After the Italian guns on the ridge were destroyed, C Squadron withdrew and came under fire from Ruweisat Ridge. On 3 July, A Squadron reconnoitred around Gebel Kalakh and was ineffectually shelled by the friendly 6th Field Regiment. Two troops from A Squadron engaged an Italian truck-mounted battalion of the <a href="Trieste%20Division">Trieste Division</a>, destroying two trucks, capturing one Italian and releasing three Indian PoWs.

On 4 July, as part of a divisional attack toward Daba, the regiment was ordered to send C squadron north-west to join the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade at El Mreir and continue to Daba. The squadron was ambushed on its way to El Mreir at 07:15; two carriers were destroyed and C Squadron was replaced by two troops from B Squadron shortly afterwards. During the afternoon, A and C Squadrons set out towards Daba but halted when night fell. A Squadron approached Mungar Wahla on 5 July but withdrew to Qaret el Yidma after heavy artillery fire. A and B Squadrons patrolled the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade front on 6 July. The next day, the division again attempted to drive toward the coast, after an all-clear report. B Squadron screened the 4th and 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigades before being halted by Axis fire and A and C Squadrons were ordered into the line to reconnoitre. Axis tanks attacking C Squadron during the afternoon were repulsed by the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade anti-tank guns. Div Cav, the rearguard for the 4th and 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade retreat, reached Deir el Munassib on the morning of 8 July and received 15 Stuarts. A Squadron patrolled the front of the 22nd Battalion during the afternoon, returning to Deir el Munassib at night. The regiment screened the front on 9–10 July, covering the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade night retreat.

A and C Squadrons supported a costly, abortive 15 July attack on Ruweisat Ridge and the regiment retreated as the division dug in at the boxes. Two troops were dispatched to join the 18th Battalion on 22 July, encountering an Axis pocket and losing a troop commander. The regiment was incorporated into the New Zealand Divisional box; A and C Squadrons dug in, and B Squadron patrolled south. On 17 and 18 August, A and C Squadrons were relieved by the <a href="Buffs%20%28Royal%20East%20Kent%20Regiment%29">Buffs</a> and <a href="Queen%27s%20Own%20Royal%20West%20Kent%20Regiment">Royal West Kents</a> and moved out.

The regiment fought in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alam%20el%20Halfa">Battle of Alam el Halfa</a>, during an attempted German thrust towards the <a href="Nile%20Delta">Nile Delta</a>. On 31 August, the regiment was alerted to the coming attack. B Squadron blocked a German advance through the box minefield, retreating after it was flanked, and two troops from A Squadron drove off eight Italian <a href="Fiat%20M13/40">Fiat M13/40</a> tanks. Later in the morning ten Axis tanks with two <a href="Flak%2088">88 mm guns</a> attacked from the Deir el Muhafid and were repulsed by the 26th Battery artillery. The regiment patrolled the northern flank on 3 September and became the mobile reserve during the New Zealand Division attack on the retreating Axis line. It was to follow the <a href="132nd%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">132nd Infantry Brigade</a> and advance to Deir Alinda, to destroy Axis motorized transport, but the brigade was stopped and the regiment withdrew to the box.

Div Cav moved rearward on 10 September for leave in Cairo. The regiment conducted manoeuvres with the division in September and returned to Burg el Arab. Colonel Nicoll was beaten up on 5 October by drunken soldiers in Maadi, where he had gone to arrange replacements, and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel James Sutherland. A total of 23 carriers with new equipment arrived from workshops on 11 October. The regiment advanced to El Hammam on 19 October in preparation for <a href="Operation%20Lightfoot">Operation Lightfoot</a>, the first Allied attack in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">Second Battle of El Alamein</a>; it was notified the following day of plans to attack the Axis rear behind the armoured brigade, advancing to El Imayid. On 22 October, Div Cav moved to its starting position at Alam el Onsol.

The advance began at night on 23 October, with the regiment advancing down a track during the artillery barrage. At daybreak, Div Cav stopped at Miteiriya Ridge because the 6th New Zealand Infantry Brigade was unable to clear lanes through the minefield. A gap was created in the evening and B and C Squadrons advanced, screening the <a href="9th%20Armoured%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">9th Armoured Brigade</a>. After traversing the minefield, the squadrons were stopped by anti-tank fire. Ten men were killed, and five tanks and four carriers destroyed.

The next day, the regiment was withdrawn and became part of the divisional reserve at Alam el Onsol. Orders arrived for an advance on 30 October for <a href="Operation%20Supercharge%20%281942%29">Operation Supercharge</a>, planned as the final attack of the battle. The regiment was placed under the command of the 9th Armoured Brigade on 1 November, with each squadron attached to an armoured unit. A Squadron was attached to the 3rd Hussars, C Squadron to the <a href="Warwickshire%20Yeomanry">Warwickshire Yeomanry</a> and B Squadron to the <a href="Royal%20Wiltshire%20Yeomanry">Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry</a>. The assault began the following day, with the squadrons ordered to screen the minefields for the armoured brigade. The 3rd Hussars reached the Rahman track, losing their anti-tank guns. The Wiltshire Yeomanry lost a <a href="Crusader%20tank">Crusader</a> squadron to anti-tank fire and was nearly destroyed by the end of the day. Four B Squadron men were killed by anti-tank fire as the squadron advanced behind the Wiltshires. The Warwickshires, mistaking high ground for their objective, destroyed several anti-tank guns there. At the end of the day the regiment, except for C Squadron, returned to Alam el Onsol.
Div Cav resumed the offensive on 4 November, advancing south-west against retreating Axis forces and ending the day at Agramiya. The regiment advanced on the northern flank of the New Zealand Division the next day, screening the division at the recaptured Baggush Box on 6 November. It then set off towards Mersa Matruh on the coast road and the escarpment, in contact with the 9th Armoured Brigade. The regiment halted at Gambut on 13 November, moving east to Menastir six days later.

Div Cav spent the first three weeks of the pursuit camped near Bardia. On 2 December, as part of the outflanking move around El Agheila, the regiment began an eight-day drive on transporters to El Haseiat. After unloading its vehicles, the regiment continued its flanking movement. On 14 December, it was placed under the command of the 4th Light Armoured Brigade, with which it spent the night. C Squadron screened the brigade in the morning and by 16:00 the regiment had drawn away from the brigade as C Squadron reached the escarpment. The German 15th Panzer Division, halted on the road due to a fuel shortage, was targeted by Div Cav. During the night, the regiment withdrew and laagered while the Germans retreated. At 05:45 the next morning, XXX Corps headquarters ordered the division to attack the Germans and the regiment was advised to expect an attack from the east by a hundred tanks. Div Cav was ordered to withdraw south-west, along the line of its previous advance. When the regiment had gone back , it surprised a German column. A Squadron engaged, as the other squadrons hastily withdrew. In the evening, the regiment advanced a mile west and laagered.

On 17 December, Div Cav guarded the northern flank of the brigade in its advance on <a href="Nofilia">Nofilia</a>; B and C Squadrons engaged the German rearguard, knocking out one Panzer III and losing two carriers. The brigade failed to capture Nofilia; although it cut the road, the Germans escaped during the night. The regiment was scheduled to camp at Nofilia for a week, with C Squadron dispatched to guard the airfield at Sultan with a detachment of engineers to <a href="Demining">clear mines</a>. The minefield was cleared by 23 December, when A Squadron replaced C Squadron. In late December, 18 new carriers arrived and the regiment prepared for another advance.

On 8 and 9 January 1943, Div Cav advanced again. The A Squadron vehicles at Nofilia were loaded on transporters, which drove down the main road while the rest of the regiment screened the New Zealand Division advance. The A Squadron vehicles were unloaded near Wadi Bei el Chebir, east of the expected German rearguard near Wadi Temet, and the regiment caught up on 14 January. The following day, A Squadron crossed the road and withstood shelling by anti-tank guns and artillery until the afternoon. B Squadron probed south, also encountering German anti-tank guns. After one of its Stuart tanks knocked out an anti-tank gun, B Squadron advanced through the German line, dislodging anti-tank guns and destroying a <a href="Sd.Kfz.%20250">Sd.Kfz. 250</a> half-track. During the afternoon, C Squadron failed to break through the German centre but that night the Germans withdrew. On 16 January, the regiment advanced to high ground above the airstrip at Sedada, losing a tank and carrier. C Squadron advanced down the plateau in the darkness, losing a carrier to a <a href="Land%20mine">mine</a> on the trail. The regiment found an alternate route, ending the day in Wadi Merdum. On 18 January, Div Cav advanced through rugged country to Beni Ulid. The regiment advanced towards Tarhuna the following day, <a href="Military%20camp">bivouacking</a> halfway there, before discovering a route through the hills north of the road.

On 21 January, Div Cav moved out of the hills, with C Squadron artillery driving off German rearguards. Next morning A and B Squadrons advanced west, turning north after crossing the Garian road, before they were halted by German resistance at Azizia. The Germans retreated during the night and the regiment found an empty village in the morning. Racing down the road, Div Cav ended the day from Tripoli before being transferred to Bianchi for a week. The regiment next encamped around Castel Benito. On 28 January, Lieutenant Colonel Sutherland left for New Zealand and was replaced by Ian Bonifant. In February, the regiment unloaded supplies from landing craft in Tripoli. On the 4th, the <a href="Eighth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Eighth Army</a> paraded through the city in front of <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery">Bernard Montgomery</a>, <a href="Richard%20McCreery">Richard McCreery</a> and Freyberg.

The Divisional Cavalry Regiment left <a href="Castel%20Benito">Castel Benito</a> on 2 March as part of the attack on the <a href="Mareth%20Line">Mareth Line</a>. On 3 March the regiment was in Tunisia, camped near the road at <a href="Medenine">Medenine</a>. The next morning it was put under command of the 4th Light Armoured Brigade, in preparation for a German assault, and moved forward, behind the 5th New Zealand Brigade positions. After the Axis repulse, A Squadron was sent south to probe the eastern end of the hills while B and C Squadrons harassed the German retreat on 7 March. The regiment patrolled the area between the <a href="11th%20Hussars">11th Hussars</a> and the Free French Flying Column for the next five days and moved back to Foum Tatahouine on 13 March, where the New Zealand Division assembled for a flanking movement inland. Div Cav advanced south-west and then north, guarding the divisional right flank. On 21 March, contact was made with the Germans and elements of the division attacked during the night. C Squadron advanced behind the infantry in the morning before being stopped by shellfire near Point 201, a battlefield elevation. As the shelling decreased, A and HQ Squadrons advanced to the C Squadron position. B Squadron arrived from night patrol, and the regiment laagered behind Point 201. On the morning of 23 March, B and C Squadrons advanced, capturing fifteen and several prisoners. From 24 to 26 March, the regiment patrolled the left flank of the line in preparation for an assault by the 1st Armoured Division. When <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a> preparation for the assault began, Div Cav marked the bomb line with smoke canisters and advanced on the flank when the ground assault began. The regiment laagered next to the Kebili-El Hamma road during the night.

On 27 March, B and C Squadrons made contact with the 1st Armoured Division. The next day, the regiment maintained contact with the retreating Germans, entering <a href="Gabes">Gabes</a> the following day. Div Cav stopped at a wadi to determine where the division could cross on a nine-vehicle front. A location was found on 30 March and C Squadron pressed ahead near the <a href="Wadi%20Akarit">Wadi Akarit</a>. The wadi was strongly defended; the regiment patrolled and probed until 5 April, before an attack by XXX Corps infantry in which the 2nd New Zealand would be in reserve. The assault did not break through the Axis resistance on the first day but succeeded on the second morning and the division pursued. The regiment advanced with the division, capturing 1,300 PoWs. On 8 April, it became part of a <a href="Battlegroup%20%28army%29">battlegroup</a> consisting of the 8th Armoured and 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigades and the <a href="1st%20King%27s%20Dragoon%20Guards">1st King's Dragoon Guards</a> (KDG). The regiment advanced another , halting in the afternoon. Resuming its advance that evening, it reached the head of the division late at night. Div Cav guarded the eastern flank the following day, with orders not to attack substantial German forces. The advance towards <a href="Sousse">Sousse</a> resumed on 10 April, with A and B Squadrons reaching <a href="El%20Djem">El Djem</a>. The regiment, pursuing the retreating Germans at dawn, was past Sousse by 08:30. As A Squadron advanced up the main road, B and C Squadrons swung west. The regiment was within of <a href="Enfidaville">Enfidaville</a> by 13 April and probed the German positions until the 19th.

Div Cav was withdrawn on 24 April and was sent back to a rest area two days later. The regiment moved forward west of Enfidaville on 4 May, moving near the town on 8 May, to exploit a breakthrough by tanks the following day. The breakthrough was forestalled by the First Army drive across Tunisia, and the Axis forces in North Africa surrendered on 13 May. Three days later, the regiment began moving back to Maadi, arriving on 1 June. At Maadi the regiment received replacements, while some personnel who had served with the first three echelons received three-month leaves in New Zealand. On 5 July, new personal weapons were issued and the regiment began training on the rifle and light machine gun ranges. A month later the regiment was one of the first units equipped with <a href="T17%20%28armored%20car%29">Staghound</a> armoured cars. Five troops in each squadron received T17s and one troop in each was equipped with a <a href="Daimler%20Dingo">Daimler Dingo</a> Scout Car. On 17 September, the regiment moved to Burg el Arab and began embarking for Italy. By 1 November its equipment had arrived and the regiment moved up to <a href="Altamura">Altamura</a>.

After the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Italy">Allied invasion of Italy</a> in early September, the Eighth Army advanced rapidly. By the middle of October the army was on the line of <a href="Termoli">Termoli</a>, <a href="Campobasso">Campobasso</a> and <a href="Vinchiaturo">Vinchiaturo</a>. German resistance had stiffened in the last stages of the advance. The <a href="Fifth%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">Fifth Army</a> captured <a href="Naples">Naples</a> on 1 October and then crossed the <a href="Volturno">Volturno</a> against strong German resistance. By this point the Allies had run up against the fortifications of the <a href="Winter%20Line">Winter Line</a>. The 15th Army Group commander <a href="Harold%20Alexander%2C%201st%20Earl%20Alexander%20of%20Tunis">Harold Alexander</a> revised the plan for the winter, which involved the capture of the high ground north of <a href="Pescara">Pescara</a> after crossing the <a href="Trigno">Trigno</a>, <a href="Sangro">Sangro</a> and <a href="Aterno-Pescara">Pescara</a> rivers. The Fifth Army would advance up the <a href="Liri">Liri Valley</a> and when both armies were close to Rome, an amphibious operation would be launched south of the <a href="Tiber">Tiber</a>. To prepare for the offensive, the Allies advanced through the outlying Winter Line defences. The Eighth Army crossed the Trigno in late October and Montgomery planned to advance along the coast road to Pescara, which was the most defended route. Montgomery considered his four infantry divisions too weak to break the line without reinforcement.
Div Cav became part of the Eighth Army reserve along with the rest of the 2nd New Zealand Division and was positioned several miles north of <a href="Lucera">Lucera</a>, near the <a href="Foggia%20Airfield%20Complex">Foggia Airfield Complex</a>, on 4 November. On 12 November, the regiment left Lucera for the front, arriving at <a href="Cupello">Cupello</a> in the afternoon to guard a bridge over the <a href="Sinello%20River">Sinello River</a> below the village of <a href="Gissi">Gissi</a>. At 09:00 the next day, the regiment moved out to its new position, forward; the trip took all day, through sleet and mountainous terrain. A Squadron guarded the bridge, while the rest of the regiment bivouacked. On 18 November, B Squadron guarded the left flank of the division, south-west of <a href="Atessa">Atessa</a>. C and HQ Squadrons advanced forward to the village of <a href="Monte%20Marcone">Monte Marcone</a> on 20 November, and A and B Squadrons were sent back to <a href="Carpineto%20Sinello">Carpineto Sinello</a> in reserve. C Squadron made contact with the British <a href="V%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">V Corps</a> on foot, since the road was demolished in three places.

In the planned offensive on the Sangro, C Squadron was to follow the 19th Armoured Regiment in its advance at 03:00. Although its tanks reached the river, they bogged down in the mud and the squadron remained on the other bank as B Squadron advanced to Monte Marconi. Three troops from C Squadron finally crossed the river by the afternoon of 29 November; one was ordered to advance to Elici and a second was to make contact with the <a href="8th%20Indian%20Infantry%20Division">8th Indian Infantry Division</a> at La Defenza. The routes were mined and the troops spent the night at 23rd Battalion headquarters. In the morning, the mines were cleared and the second troop contacted the Indians and advanced east of Elici; the first troop was held up by shelling south of Elici.

Three troops from B Squadron tried to probe <a href="Casoli">Casoli</a> but failed since the bridges over the river had been destroyed; a foot patrol formed from the squadron was sent. C Squadron advanced forward of Elici after it was abandoned by the Axis. The <a href="New%20Zealand%20Engineers">New Zealand Engineers</a> constructed a <a href="Bailey%20bridge">Bailey bridge</a> over the river, allowing B Squadron to cross on 1 December. The squadron attempted to capture <a href="Guardiagrele">Guardiagrele</a> the next day but was repulsed by anti-tank gunfire. Two troops from C Squadron entered <a href="Castel%20Frentano">Castelfrentano</a>, joining the tanks of the 18th Armoured Regiment. On 4 December, A and B Squadrons attempted to find a way through Frisa, working to the right for an easier approach towards <a href="Arielli">Arielli</a>. The division was to attack on the <a href="Orsogna">Orsogna</a> road and contain the <a href="26th%20Panzer%20Division">26th Panzer Division</a>. On 1 January 1944, B Squadron was sent forward as infantry to take over the sector between <a href="San%20Eusanio">San Eusanio</a> and Guardiagrele. It was relieved on 19 January and the regiment moved back over the Sangro to another sector.

To divert German troops from the <a href="Battle%20of%20Anzio">Anzio landings</a> (Operation Shingle), the Fifth Army was ordered to advance towards Cassino and <a href="Frosinone">Frosinone</a> before 22 January, <a href="D-Day%20%28military%20term%29">D-Day</a> for the operation. To provide a reserve for the army group, the 2nd New Zealand Division was withdrawn to the Naples area. The division became part of the ad hoc New Zealand <a href="Corps">Corps</a> after its reinforcement by the 4th Indian Division and the regiment was posted above the <a href="Volturno%20River">Volturno River</a> around the village of <a href="Raviscanina">Raviscanina</a>. Arriving on 22 January, it moved forward to an assembly area at <a href="Stazione%20di%20Toro">Stazione di Toro</a> on 6 February. The Fifth Army advance had stalled and the 2nd New Zealand Division moved into the line. Three days later the regiment replaced the 21st Battalion on the <a href="Gari%20%28river%29">Gari river</a>, opposite Sant'Angelo. On 15 February, the Benedictine monastery on Monte Cassino was bombed and two days later the Maori Battalion attacked the Cassino railway station. There was only enough space for a two-company advance, so Divisional Cavalry and 24th Battalion machine-gunned and mortared the area to their front to create the impression of a larger attack. The regiment laid down a mortar barrage on its front to screen the Maoris with smoke. The Maori Battalion advanced to the railway station but was forced back over the Rapido in the late afternoon. Div Cav moved out of the line to <a href="Monte%20Trocchio">Monte Trocchio</a> on 23 February and was relieved by the 1st Battalion, <a href="East%20Surrey%20Regiment">East Surrey Regiment</a> from the British <a href="78th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">78th Division</a>. On 15 March, the Monte Cassino assault resumed, and C Squadron kept the Route 6 bridge over the Gari-Rapido shrouded from German observation with smoke. The regiment pulled out of the line on 20 March, taking up the new left flank of New Zealand Division along the <a href="Gari%20River">Gari River</a> and was relieved on 9 April by the 22nd Battalion.
Div Cav rested near <a href="Filignano">Filignano</a> and <a href="Montaquila">Montaquila</a>. Two troops from C Squadron were positioned along the <a href="Venafro">Venafro</a>–<a href="Atina%2C%20Lazio">Atina</a> road and the rest of the regiment built the road between Filignano and Montaquila. On 18 April, Bonifant left for New Zealand on furlough and was replaced by his second-in-command, Major Nicholas Wilder. On 10 May, the final offensive against the <a href="Gustav%20Line">Gustav Line</a> began; the regiment was combined with the 22nd and 24th Battalions and No. 2 Company of the <a href="27th%20Machine%20Gun%20Battalion%20%28New%20Zealand%29">27th Machine Gun Battalion</a> to become Pleasants Force, to take over positions held by the <a href="Kimberley%20Regiment">Kimberley Rifles</a>. On the night of 11 May, the final battle for Monte Cassino began. The <a href="French%20Expeditionary%20Corps%20%281943%E2%80%9344%29">French Expeditionary Corps</a> outflanked the German defences in an advance along the <a href="Aurunci%20Mountains">Aurunci Mountains</a>. The 78th Infantry Division advanced to Route 6 and on the right of the Eighth Army the <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Poland%29">II Polish Corps</a> captured Monte Cassino. The Gustav Line was soon broken through and Allied troops in the Anzio beachhead conducted a breakout. By 26 May, the Axis was retreating; the regiment retrieved its vehicles and drove up the valley to Atina, passing through during the evening before it was stopped by opposition at <a href="Vicalvi">Vicalvi</a>. Three days later Vicalvi was captured by the 21st Battalion and the regiment advanced through the town. Since the bridge over the <a href="Fibreno%20River">Fibreno River</a> had been destroyed, B Squadron guarded the site while two troops found their way across and provided a flank guard for the Maori Battalion. C Squadron remained in Vicalvi on 31 May and A Squadron held <a href="Posta%2C%20Lazio">Posta</a> until it was replaced by the <a href="RAF%20Regiment">RAF Regiment</a>. B Squadron moved up to <a href="Sora%2C%20Lazio">Sora</a> when the bridge was completed. On 1 June, B Squadron advanced toward <a href="Isola%20del%20Liri">Isola del Liri</a>, which was captured by the 8th Indian Infantry Division. A Squadron was transferred to the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade to advance with it in pursuit, while the rest of the regiment laagered on the Fibreno. Allied troops rapidly advanced and Rome was captured on 4 June.

On 5 June, the main part of the regiment was combined with two companies of infantry and a squadron of tanks to form Wilder Force, which was to take over the front from the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade. A Squadron pushed up the valley and Wilder Force advanced behind, through <a href="Balsorano">Balsorano</a>. After the Axis retreated to their next line of defence, the New Zealand Division withdrew to <a href="Arce%2C%20Lazio">Arce</a> for training. The regiment moved forward again on 10 July, advancing to <a href="Cortona">Cortona</a> on 11–12 July. B Squadron was transferred to 6th New Zealand Infantry Brigade and sent forward to <a href="Castiglion%20Fiorentino">Castiglion Fiorentino</a> to clear the road between Castiglion and <a href="Palazzo%20del%20Pero">Palazzo del Pero</a>. The road was opened by the 6th Armoured Division, and the crossroads on Route 73 was reached on 15 July. The New Zealand Division moved to capture <a href="Florence">Florence</a>; the regiment advanced west to <a href="Siena">Siena</a> and then turned north to <a href="Castellina%20in%20Chianti">Castellina</a>. A Squadron supported the 23rd and 28th Battalions advancing on <a href="San%20Casciano%20in%20Val%20di%20Pesa">San Casciano</a> and the remainder of the regiment arrived at San Donato by 22 July. Two days later, C Squadron combined with A Squadron of the 19th Armoured Brigade, No. 2 Company of the 22nd Battalion and 1st Troop of the 31st Anti-tank Battery to form "Armcav". The force advanced on 25 July, taking <a href="Fabbrica%20Curone">Fabbrica</a> and advancing toward <a href="Bibbione">Bibbione</a>. Bibbione was taken despite determined opposition the next day and the other two squadrons supported the Maori Battalion. "Armcav" was disbanded on 27 July and C Squadron remained under the command of the 4th Armoured Brigade.

San Casciano was captured shortly afterwards and the final assault on Florence began on 1 August. A Squadron was in reserve and B Squadron patrolled northward. C Squadron advanced on Geppetto, covering the left flank of the 6th New Zealand Infantry Brigade. Geppetto was captured the next morning and C Squadron patrolled forward to San Michele. B Squadron advanced with the Maori Battalion, ending the day and advancing the next morning with that unit. C Squadron moved west on Route 67 until it was halted by opposition near <a href="Grioli">Grioli</a> and A Squadron advanced to <a href="Scandicci">Scandicci</a> in the afternoon as Florence fell.

The New Zealand Division was temporarily relieved and to cover its replacement by the US <a href="United%20States%20Army%20North">Fifth Army</a>, B Squadron was attached to the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade, C Squadron to the 5th New Zealand Infantry and A Squadron to the 6th New Zealand Infantry. On the morning of 11 August, C Squadron supported the 23rd Battalion advance from <a href="Emboli%2C%20Italy">Emboli</a> to the <a href="Arno">Arno</a> River. B Squadron was positioned in San Vito and A Squadron behind the <a href="Pesa%20River">Pesa River</a>. The regiment withdrew to the divisional area near Castellina on 16 August, moving with the division to <a href="Iesi">Iesi</a> on the <a href="Adriatic">Adriatic</a>. Arriving on 29 August, it was transferred to <a href="Fano">Fano</a> on 5 September. The regiment moved back into the line on 22 September at <a href="Rimini">Rimini</a>, advancing along Route 16 towards <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a>. On 29 September, all armoured cars were recalled due to heavy rain and poor visibility. Wilder Force was re-formed on 3 October from the dismounted regiment and a machine-gun platoon and it began crossing the <a href="Fiumicino">Fiumicino</a> River on 15 October. Four days later, Wilder Force was dissolved and the regiment returned to its vehicles. On 21 October, B and C Squadrons attempted to secure the area around Pisignano and were within a mile of the town by the end of the day. Since it was strongly held by the Axis, the 22nd Battalion came forward and the squadrons withdrew.
Div Cav withdrew to Cesolo near <a href="San%20Severino%20Marche">San Severino</a>, in the rear. The regiment was converted to a standard infantry battalion, since its light armoured vehicles were considered unsuited to Italian terrain and the division was short of infantry. The battalion retained the title of Squadron for its company-size units, spent a month retraining as infantry and left Cesolo on 24 November. Around this time D Squadron was formed under command of Major S.W. Askew. The New Zealand Division was placed under the command of V Corps for the crossing of the <a href="Lamone%20%28river%29">Lamone</a> river and the capture of <a href="Faenza">Faenza</a>. The battalion became part of the 6th New Zealand Infantry Brigade, operating in the sector facing the Lamone opposite Faenza and the brigade's small front was held by the 26th Battalion. The 24th and 25th Battalions were scheduled to replace the 26th next, with Div Cav replacing them. The battalion camped in <a href="Forl%C3%AC">Forlì</a> before taking over its positions on 2 December. The division mounted a simulated attack to support the British 46th Division crossing of the Lamone with an artillery barrage and tank fire. After the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade moved south to take over the 46th Division positions, the 6th New Zealand Infantry Brigade moved west to take over the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade sector and the regiment was now opposite Faenza. A and B Squadrons moved to the rear, after being relieved by the British 4th Reconnaissance Regiment and C Squadron laid smoke to cover the 13 December crossing of the Lamone by 4th Brigade tanks. The attack on Faenza began the next day and the Maori and 23rd Battalions were at their objectives by 15 December but Axis holdouts continued to resist in the town. The regiment entered Faenza in the afternoon and camped there until 27 December, when it replaced 26th Battalion on the Senio. During the night of 1/2 January 1945, the Maori Battalion relieved the battalion, which moved to Forlì. Div Cav returned to the front after a week and took up the positions of the 25th Battalion, which it fortified against a possible German counter-attack. Alexander decided to wait for early spring to advance to the Po and the battalion settled into static positional warfare. The battalion was relieved by the 25th Battalion on 21 January and returned to Forlì.

During the final Allied offensive in Italy, the battalion was assigned to the new <a href="9th%20Brigade%20%28New%20Zealand%29">9th New Zealand Infantry Brigade</a>, which was allocated as the divisional reserve in April for <a href="Operation%20Buckland">Operation Buckland</a>. Initially, the battalion protected the engineers bridging the Senio. When the bridges were finished, it covered the open flank around Barbiano resulting from a delay to the <a href="3rd%20Carpathian%20Division">3rd Carpathian Division</a>. The battalion then attacked <a href="Massa%20Lombarda">Massa Lombarda</a> in preparation for a crossing of the <a href="Sillaro">Sillaro</a> river, boarding <a href="Kangaroo%20APC">Kangaroo APC</a>s and moving forward. <a href="Tiger%20I">Tiger tanks</a> forced the battalion to dismount and dig in before the Tigers were knocked out by Allied artillery. A and C Squadrons supported the 22nd Battalion in attacking <a href="Squazzaloca">Squazzaloca</a>. The battalion reached the Sillaro River, crossed it at first light and was relieved by the 27th Battalion on 15 April. D Squadron cleared Sesto Imolese of Axis troops, with A and B Squadrons protecting the left flank. On 16–17 April, the battalion protected the right flank behind the 22nd Battalion. The attack across the <a href="Gaiana">Gaiana</a> began with a massive artillery barrage during the night of 18 April. Although the battalion crossed the river unopposed, it was counter-attacked beyond the barrage area. Advancing against stiff Axis resistance, A and C Squadrons were on the far side of the Quaderna Canal by 01:30 on 19 April. The battalion dug in there, resisting Axis counter-attacks; eleven men from the battalion were killed and 47 wounded.

Relieved by the 23rd Battalion, Div Cav was moved back to <a href="Medicina">Medicina</a>. After two days of rest there, the 9th Infantry Brigade returned to the front lines behind the Allied advance towards the <a href="Po%20%28river%29">Po</a> river. The battalion was north of <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a> by the first night back, when it was bombed by an Axis aircraft which wounded four men. Next day the battalion was on the banks of the <a href="Reno%20%28river%29">Reno</a> river and crossed the Po after the rest of the brigade on 26 April. After its advance was stopped by the Fratta Canal, the battalion moved east to <a href="Ospedaletto%20Euganeo">Ospedaletto</a>. A and C Squadrons cleared Ospedaletto of the Axis rearguard, taking fifty prisoners. The battalion bypassed scattered German units, racing for <a href="Padua">Padua</a> during the night. It reached Padua around midnight and was greeted by jubilant Italian crowds. On 29 April a shell struck battalion headquarters, wounding Lieutenant Colonel Wilder and killing two men (the last men of Div Cav killed in action during the war). Wilder was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Victor Tanner; the battalion advanced again at midday on Route 11 towards <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, encountering its last strong German resistance in <a href="Mira%2C%20Veneto">Mira</a>. No. 12 Troop flanked the German positions, capturing 140 men and killing about 20. The battalion raced on, changing to Route 14 headed for <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a>, and was ferried over the <a href="Piave%20%28river%29">Piave</a> on 30 April; it was at <a href="Monfalcone">Monfalcone</a>, controlled by <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Yugoslav partisans</a>, by the end of 1 May. Trieste was reached the next day and the battalion camped just beyond the city. Div Cav was relieved on 6 May by a battalion of the <a href="363rd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">363rd Infantry Regiment</a> of the US <a href="91st%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">91st Division</a>, and moved to <a href="Barcola">Barcola</a>.

After the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945, the New Zealand government agreed to contribute units to a joint <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a> (BCOF). The 9th New Zealand Infantry Brigade – including Div Cav, which regained its identity as a regiment – became part of the NZ contingent, known as <a href="J%20Force">J Force</a>. In October, D Squadron was changed into an all-Maori unit, replacing men sent back to New Zealand. The regiment embarked for <a href="Kure">Kure</a> on 21 February 1946, reaching its destination on 19 March and relieving the <a href="3rd%20Battalion%2C%20Royal%20Australian%20Regiment">67th Australian Battalion</a> on <a href="Eta-jima">Eta-Jima</a> on 23 March; it was billeted in <a href="Naval%20Academy%20Etajima">Naval Academy Etajima</a>. After patrolling the island, the regiment was replaced by the <a href="Royal%20Welch%20Fusiliers">Royal Welch Fusiliers</a> and moved to <a href="Hirao">Hirao</a>. By May its permanent headquarters was at the <a href="Mizuba">Mizuba</a> naval barracks. Lieutenant Colonel John Worsnop took command on 28 June 1946 and the regimental flag was lowered for the last time on 5 August 1947; the regiment was disbanded on 1 September 1947.

During the war, the regiment suffered a total of 686 casualties, including 134 killed, 430 wounded, and 111 captured. Five officers received the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>. The following awards (in some cases, multiple times) were also bestowed: 12 Military Crosses, 5 <a href="Distinguished%20Conduct%20Medal">Distinguished Conduct Medal</a>s, 24 <a href="Military%20Medal">Military Medal</a>s, and one <a href="British%20Empire%20Medal">British Empire Medal</a>. Three soldiers were appointed <a href="Members%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Members of the Order of the British Empire</a>. One officer also received the Silver Cross of the Greek <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Phoenix%20%28Greece%29">Order of the Phoenix</a>. Several of these awards were bestowed to Div Cav personnel for actions while attached to the Long Range Desert Group.

In 1957, the New Zealand Scottish Regiment, which inherited the Divisional Cavalry's lineage, was awarded the following <a href="battle%20honour">battle honour</a>s for the service of the Divisional Cavalry Regiment:

Triaenops menamena

Triaenops menamena is a <a href="bat">bat</a> in the genus "<a href="Triaenops">Triaenops</a>" found on <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, mainly in the drier regions. It was known as "Triaenops rufus" until 2009, when it was discovered that that name had been incorrectly applied to the species. "Triaenops rufus" is a <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> of "<a href="Triaenops%20persicus">Triaenops persicus</a>", a Middle Eastern species closely related to "T. menamena"— the Malagasy species had previously been placed as a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of "T. persicus" by some authors. "Triaenops menamena" is mostly found in forests, but also occurs in other habitats. It often roosts in large colonies and eats insects such as <a href="lepidoptera">butterflies and moths</a>. Because of its wide range, common occurrence, and tolerance of <a href="habitat%20degradation">habitat degradation</a>, it is not considered to be threatened.

With a forearm length of 50 to 56 mm (2.0 to 2.2 in) in males and 46 to 53 mm (1.8 to 2.1 in) in females, this is a medium-sized bat. Its fur color is variable, ranging from reddish brown to gray, but it is generally darker than the species in the closely related genus "<a href="Paratriaenops">Paratriaenops</a>" which also occur on Madagascar. The skull contains a pronounced swelling around the nose and the second upper <a href="premolar">premolar</a> is displaced outside the toothrow. The maximum frequency of the <a href="animal%20echolocation">echolocation</a> call averages 94.2 k<a href="hertz">Hz</a> and the species can easily be recognized on the basis of its call.

In 1881, <a href="Alphonse%20Milne-Edwards">Alphonse Milne-Edwards</a> described two new species in the genus "<a href="Triaenops">Triaenops</a>" on the basis of specimens supposedly collected by <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Humblot">Léon Humblot</a> on Madagascar: the reddish "Triaenops rufus" and the larger, gray "T. humbloti". <a href="Jean%20Dorst">Jean Dorst</a>, who reviewed Madagascan "Triaenops" in 1947, retained both as separate species; in another review, published in 1982, <a href="John%20Edwards%20Hill">John Edwards Hill</a> considered the two to represent the same species. In 1994, <a href="Karl%20Koopman">Karl Koopman</a> considered "rufus" itself to be part of the Middle Eastern and mainland African species "<a href="Triaenops%20persicus">Triaenops persicus</a>", a possibility Hill had discussed, but most authors regarded the two as distinct species. In 2006, Julie Ranivo and <a href="Steven%20Goodman">Steven Goodman</a> revised Madagascan "Triaenops" and found little variation among specimens of "T. rufus" from throughout the dry parts of the island. Three years later, they published another paper which showed that the original material of "T. rufus" and "T. humbloti" was distinct from Madagascan specimens identified as ""Triaenops rufus"" and more similar to "T. persicus". On his journey to Madagascar, Humblot had stayed in Somalia and Yemen, and Goodman and Ranivo concluded that he had probably collected the "Triaenops" there, after which their provenance was incorrectly recorded. Thus, "rufus" and "humbloti" cannot be used for the Madagascan species, and Goodman and Ranivo proposed the new name "Triaenops menamena" for the species formerly known as "T. rufus". The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "menamena" is <a href="Malagasy%20language">Malagasy</a> for "reddish", referring to the animal's coloration. "Rufous trident bat" has been used as a <a href="common%20name">common name</a> for "Triaenops rufus".

"Triaenops menamena" is currently one of four living species in the genus "Triaenops"; a 2009 revision by Petr Benda and Peter Vallo split off the African "<a href="Triaenops%20afer">T. afer</a>" and the Yemeni "<a href="Triaenops%20parvus">T. parvus</a>" from "T. persicus" and removed three other species, including two from Madagascar, to the separate genus "<a href="Paratriaenops">Paratriaenops</a>". An extinct species, "<a href="Triaenops%20goodmani">Triaenops goodmani</a>", is known from northwestern Madagascar. In 2007 and 2008, Amy Russell and colleagues used <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> and <a href="coalescent%20theory">coalescent</a> methodologies to investigate the history of the "Triaenops" group. They found that "T. menamena" (as "T. rufus") was closest to mainland African "Triaenops" (but did not study Middle Eastern bats) and concluded that "T. menamena" and the species of "Paratriaenops" (then still placed in "Triaenops") independently reached Madagascar from Africa; the colonization of the island by "T. menamena" was dated to about 660,000 years ago. Benda and Vallo also studied phylogenetic relationships in "Triaenops" and included Middle Eastern "T. persicus" and "T. parvus" in their analysis. They found little resolution of relationships within "Triaenops", but some evidence suggested that "T. menamena" is more closely related to the Middle Eastern species than to "T. afer" in mainland Africa; therefore, "T. menamena" may have reached Madagascar from the Middle East or northeastern Africa. They also placed the split between "T. menamena" and the other species much further back, at around 4 million years ago.

"Triaenops menamena" is a medium-sized species with variable fur coloration, ranging from reddish brown to gray. It is larger and darker than "Paratriaenops auritus" and "P. furculus". Among living "Triaenops" species, it is smaller than "T. persicus" and "T. afer", but somewhat larger than "T. parvus". The extinct "Triaenops goodmani", which is known only from three <a href="mandible">mandible</a>s (lower jaws), is also larger. In the complexly shaped <a href="noseleaf">noseleaf</a> (a group of fleshy structures around the nose and mouth), "T. menamena" has the trident structure characteristic of "Triaenops" and "Paratriaenops": three adjacent lancets (projecting structures) on the posterior leaf. In "T. menamena", the two outer lancets are shorter than the middle one and curved, whereas the three lancets are more equal in "Paratriaenops". The anterior leaf contains a broad, flat, horizontal <a href="process%20%28anatomy%29">process</a> and the intermediate leaf contains a pointed process. The ears are small and broad and contain notches on the inner side. The fur is silky and the hairs on the body are about 5 to 6 mm long. The wing membrane is dark and translucent and the end of the tail usually projects from the <a href="uropatagium">uropatagium</a> (tail membrane). Males average slightly larger than females. Wingspan is 270 to 305 mm (10.6 to 12.0 in).

The skull is similar to that of Madagascan "Paratriaenops", but the <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a> is longer. The rostrum (front part of the skull) is well-developed and contains a pronounced nasal swelling, which is less pronounced than in "Paratriaenops"; the depression behind the swelling is relatively shallow. Compared to other species of "Triaenops", the rostrum is relatively narrow and short, similar to "T. parvus"; "T. afer" and "T. persicus" have a broader rostrum. The front margin of the rostrum is cast back between the left and right corners. A transverse line passes over the roof of the rostrum. The <a href="infraorbital%20foramen">infraorbital foramen</a>, an opening in the skull, is oblong in shape. The <a href="zygomatic%20arch">zygomatic arch</a>es (cheekbones) are not broadened towards the sides, are connected to the <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a>ries by broad bones, and contain clear crests on their upper sides. In "T. menamena", these crests are rectangular in form and larger than in "Paratriaenops". The <a href="braincase">braincase</a> is lower than in other species of "Triaenops". The <a href="sagittal%20crest">sagittal crest</a>, which is on the roof of the braincase, is poorly developed. In the mandible, the <a href="coronoid%20process%20of%20the%20mandible">coronoid process</a> is blunt and rounded, but the <a href="angular%20process">angular process</a> (both <a href="process%20%28anatomy%29">processes</a> at the back of the bone) is small.

The upper <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s have two cusps and the upper <a href="canine%20%28tooth%29">canine</a> has three—a large central one, a small but well-developed one at the back, and a small cuspule at the front. The front upper <a href="premolar">premolar</a> is projected outside the toothrow, so that the canine before it and back premolar behind it touch. The first lower incisor has two cusps and the second has three. On the second lower molar, the <a href="protoconid">protoconid</a> cusp is notably taller than the <a href="hypoconid">hypoconid</a>; these cusps are about as high in "T. goodmani".

The species can easily be identified from recordings of its <a href="animal%20echolocation">echolocation</a> call. The call consists of a component with constant frequency followed by a short one with changing frequency. The call takes 6.5 to 13.5 <a href="millisecond">ms</a>, averaging 10.1 ms, and the period between two calls is 22.7 to 86.3 ms, averaging 42.7 ms. The maximum frequency averages 94.2 kHz, the minimum frequency averages 82.0 kHz, and the call emits the most energy at a frequency of 93.2 kHz.

"Triaenops menamena" mainly occurs in the dry regions of western Madagascar, but has also been recorded in humid areas in the far southeast and northeast, and is found up to 1300 m (4300 ft) above sea level. It mainly occurs in forests, but has also been recorded outside forest and is not dependent on it. An obligate cave dweller, it is known to roost in large colonies, with one cave colony estimated to contain over 40,000 bats; this cave also contained an estimated 10,000 "Paratriaenops furculus". The <a href="effective%20population%20size">effective population size</a> of the species is estimated to be about 121,000. <a href="Lepidoptera">Lepidoptera</a> (butterflies and moths) form the main component of its diet, but it also eats <a href="Coleoptera">Coleoptera</a> (beetles) and <a href="Hemiptera">Hemiptera</a> (bugs) and fewer members of some other insect orders. It is unclear how the <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>s of "Triaenops" and the less frequently captured "Paratriaenops furculus" are separated, as both eat lepidopterans and occur in the same regions.

Under "Triaenops rufus", the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> lists this species as being of "<a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>", citing its common occurrence over a wide distribution and tolerance of human modifications of its habitat, even though its forest habitat is being destroyed in places. It has been recorded in numerous <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a>s. Bats, mainly the large "<a href="Hipposideros%20commersoni">Hipposideros commersoni</a>", are sometimes hunted for food in southwestern Madagascar, and "T. menamena" is also taken incidentally.

Love the Way You Lie

"Love the Way You Lie" is a song recorded by the American rapper <a href="Eminem">Eminem</a>, featuring <a href="Barbadian%20people">Barbadian</a> singer <a href="Rihanna">Rihanna</a>, from Eminem's seventh studio album "<a href="Recovery%20%28Eminem%20album%29">Recovery</a>" (2010). The singer and songwriter <a href="Skylar%20Grey">Skylar Grey</a> wrote and recorded a <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demo</a> of the song alongside the producer <a href="Alex%20da%20Kid">Alex da Kid</a> when she felt she was in an abusive romantic relationship with the music industry. Eminem wrote the verses and chose Rihanna to sing the chorus, resulting in a collaboration influenced by their past experiences in difficult relationships. Recording sessions were held in <a href="Ferndale%2C%20Michigan">Ferndale, Michigan</a>, and Dublin, Ireland. Backed by guitar, piano and violin, the track is a <a href="tempo">midtempo</a> hip-hop <a href="ballad">ballad</a> with a <a href="Pop%20music">pop</a> refrain, sung by Rihanna, and describes two lovers who refuse to separate despite being in a dangerous <a href="love%E2%80%93hate%20relationship">love–hate relationship</a>.

<a href="Interscope%20Records">Interscope Records</a> released the song in June 2010 as the second single from "Recovery". Critics praised its melody but were divided on thematic aspects such as poignancy and accuracy. Eminem promoted the single with performances at the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%202010">2010 Electronic Entertainment Expo</a>, the <a href="2010%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2010 MTV Video Music Awards</a> and <a href="music%20festival">festivals</a>. The music video, directed by <a href="Joseph%20Kahn">Joseph Kahn</a>, stars <a href="Dominic%20Monaghan">Dominic Monaghan</a> and <a href="Megan%20Fox">Megan Fox</a> in a violent relationship and shows Eminem and Rihanna in front of a burning house. The clip had a mixed reception due to scenes of <a href="domestic%20violence">domestic violence</a>. Reporters suggested that the song and its accompanying video were influenced by Eminem's and Rihanna's relationships with their respective ex-lovers Kimberly Scott and <a href="Chris%20Brown">Chris Brown</a>.

Critics listed "Love the Way You Lie" among the best tracks of 2010 and of Eminem's career. The song won many awards and received five <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy</a> nominations. It is Eminem's best-selling single and ranked number one on several <a href="record%20chart">record chart</a>s, including the United States' <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> for seven weeks. The single sold six million copies in the US and one million in the UK. Musical acts such as <a href="Cher%20Lloyd">Cher Lloyd</a> and <a href="The%20Band%20Perry">The Band Perry</a> have performed <a href="cover%20versions">cover versions</a>. Rihanna has said that the theme of domestic violence, a topic on which she claims many people do not have insight, is what makes the song effective. She later recorded "<a href="Love%20the%20Way%20You%20Lie%20%28Part%20II%29">Love the Way You Lie (Part II)</a>", narrated mostly from her perspective.

Development of "Love the Way You Lie" began with the backing track and <a href="Hook%20%28music%29">hook</a> melody, which was created by the British <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> producer <a href="Alex%20da%20Kid">Alex da Kid</a>. When making a track, he said he spends hours making <a href="loop%20%28music%29">loops</a> and produces an electronic drum rhythm before adding live instrumentation. The drums are <a href="Sampling%20%28music%29">sampled</a> from live recordings he saves. Alex da Kid recorded an <a href="acoustic%20guitar">acoustic guitar</a> for the verses with a <a href="Georg%20Neumann">Georg Neumann</a> U87 microphone and an Avid Mbox audio interface. He told "<a href="Sound%20on%20Sound">Sound on Sound</a>" magazine that this song had given him an opportunity to reintroduce live guitar in hip hop music. During the session, he used <a href="Waves%20Audio">Waves</a> RVerb and REQ equalization on his main <a href="Bass%20drum">kick</a> track and a MaxxBass plug-in on two others.

Writing began in late 2009, when the American singer <a href="Skylar%20Grey">Holly Hafermann</a> resided at the Artula Retreat in <a href="Bandon%2C%20Oregon">Bandon, Oregon</a>, and composed songs. Later, in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, under her new stage name Skylar Grey, she visited her <a href="Universal%20Music%20Group">Universal Music</a> publisher, <a href="Jennifer%20Blakeman">Jennifer Blakeman</a>, to seek help presenting her work; Blakeman suggested she collaborate with Alex da Kid. The producer emailed Grey his track, which suggested a theme of abusive romantic relationships to her as she spontaneously sang lyrics to the melody. She told the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" that she was in an abusive relationship with the <a href="music%20industry">music industry</a>: "I love it so much, and I give it all that I have, yet it beats me down." This idea inspired her writing, a process she found came naturally, as if she were creating an <a href="alternative%20pop">alternative pop</a> song for herself. She wrote the <a href="refrain">chorus</a> to "Love the Way You Lie" in fifteen minutes and recorded vocals for Alex da Kid's <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demo</a>.

In early 2010, Alex da Kid offered the <a href="Shady%20Records">Shady Records</a> Senior Director <a href="Rigo%20%26quot%3BRiggs%26quot%3B%20Morales">Rigo "Riggs" Morales</a> some backing tracks. Morales enjoyed the tracks and sent them to <a href="Eminem">Eminem</a>, who was seeking a different musical approach for his next album. Impressed with Alex da Kid's work, Eminem asked for more tracks and subsequently heard "Love the Way You Lie". He chose it and told his manager <a href="Paul%20Rosenberg%20%28music%20manager%29">Paul Rosenberg</a> he wanted to collaborate with the Barbadian singer <a href="Rihanna">Rihanna</a>. Eminem told <a href="Skyrock%20%28radio%29">Skyrock</a>, "It's one of those tracks that I felt like only she could pull it off." Rosenberg sent the track to Rihanna, who accepted Eminem's request "at the last moment." Eminem then wrote the rapped verses.

Rihanna said she joined the collaboration because she could relate to the theme of the song, as she and Eminem had been in difficult relationships on "different ends of the table". Eminem had released the songs "<a href="%2797%20Bonnie%20%26amp%3B%20Clyde">'97 Bonnie & Clyde</a>" (1998) and "<a href="Kim%20%28song%29">Kim</a>" (2000), in which he fantasizes, respectively, about murdering and verbally abusing his then-wife Kimberly Scott. They had divorced in 2001 and again in 2006 after a remarriage. In February 2009, Rihanna's relationship with the American singer <a href="Chris%20Brown">Chris Brown</a> had ended following his felony assault on her. Rihanna described "Love the Way You Lie" as unique, realistic and deep, saying that it "broke down the cycle of domestic violence" because few people had insight on the topic.

Mike Strange recorded and <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> Eminem's vocals at Effigy Studios in <a href="Ferndale%2C%20Michigan">Ferndale, Michigan</a>. The sessions took two days. Strange edited the vocals with D-Verb—a <a href="reverberation">reverberation</a> software—and an Extra Long Delay plug-in. He preferred to make few changes; for "Love the Way You Lie" he almost exclusively used board <a href="Dynamic%20range%20compression">compression</a> and console <a href="equalization%20%28audio%29">equalization</a>. Strange used the Bricasti and Eventide Reverb 2016 mixing tools for "brighter" reverberation. Detroit musician <a href="Luis%20Resto%20%28musician%29">Luis Resto</a> has contributed to the arrangement on many of Eminem's songs, but did not do so for "Love the Way You Lie". According to Strange, "Everything we needed was already in the track, apart from the vocals." Two to three weeks after the sessions, Alex da Kid arrived to help mix and <a href="Audio%20mastering">master</a> the track. He wanted to replace the acoustic guitar on the demo, but Eminem chose to keep it. Strange said, "It was simply a matter of trying to match and then to improve on the demo [Alex da Kid]'d sent us." Strange's brother Joe <a href="audio%20engineering">engineered</a> the track.

Rihanna's recording sessions took place at Sun Studios in Dublin, Ireland, and were engineered by Marcos Tovar. The American songwriter <a href="Makeba%20Riddick">Makeba Riddick</a> provided additional vocal production. Strange used equalization, compression and reverberation but left the vocal balance. He assumed that Rihanna was satisfied with her recorded vocals and did not make major changes on her seven stereo vocal tracks.

"Love the Way You Lie" is a <a href="Tempo">midtempo</a> hip hop <a href="sentimental%20ballad">ballad</a>. The lyrics describe a couple's refusal to separate despite having an abusive relationship. According to the sheet music from <a href="Universal%20Music%20Publishing%20Group">Universal Music Publishing Group</a>, the song is in the <a href="Key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="G%20minor">G minor</a> with a <a href="common%20time">common time</a> signature and a tempo of 84 <a href="beats%20per%20minute">beats per minute</a>. The <a href="vocal%20range">vocal range</a> spans from <a href="B%E2%99%AD%20%28musical%20note%29">B</a> to <a href="D%20%28musical%20note%29">D</a>. "Love the Way You Lie" opens as Rihanna sings the <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> refrain over a piano:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts.
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie.

The refrain is based on a Gm–E–B–F/A <a href="chord%20progression">chord progression</a>. Fraser McAlpine of the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> wrote that Rihanna feels confined "in a cell of [her] own creation". She sings without <a href="vibrato">vibrato</a>, a pulsating musical effect used to add expression. One commentator, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" David Brownie, wrote that despite this, her voice subtly shows grief and regret. Eminem then "zap[s] out into a ballady rap": "I can't tell you what it really is/ I can only tell you what it feels like." The verses follow a Gm–EB–Fsus/A chord progression. Eminem regrets an end to an abusive, failed relationship, describing mutual violence and expressing both fondness and anger. The two artists' characters are portrayed in a romantic relationship when he responds to Rihanna by concluding the verse: "I laid hands on her. I'll never stoop so low again/ I guess I don't know my own strength." Rihanna sings the chorus again, backed by an <a href="electric%20guitar">electric guitar</a> and a piano.

Acoustic guitar, violin and drums accompany Eminem's verses. The lyrics transition from discussing positive aspects of love to describing violent events. Eminem raps, "It's the rage that took over, it controls you both, so they say it's best to go your separate ways. Guess that they don't know ya, cause today that was yesterday." <a href="Sady%20Doyle">Sady Doyle</a> of "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>" interpreted these lyrics as the rapper's confession to having abused Scott, as he "turns the anger and accusations toward himself". In the second verse, Eminem accepts the outcome after feeling sorry, admitting, "Yesterday is over, it's a different day." His frustration increases and he raps that two personalities can clash and devastate: "maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano". The described <a href="love%E2%80%93hate%20relationship">love–hate relationship</a> worsens and leads to <a href="domestic%20violence">domestic violence</a>. Eminem admits to lying about promises he makes and says late in the song, "If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire", a reference to Rihanna's lyrics.

On May 27, 2010, Eminem revealed the title of "Love the Way You Lie" as part of the track list of his seventh studio album "<a href="Recovery%20%28Eminem%20album%29">Recovery</a>", which came out on June 21. Initially a radio single, the song was released later by <a href="Polydor%20Records">Polydor Records</a> as a <a href="compact%20disc%20single">CD</a> in the United Kingdom on August 9, 2010. <a href="Interscope%20Records">Interscope Records</a> distributed it in Germany on August 20.

"Love the Way You Lie" received generally favorable reviews. An editor for "<a href="Rap-Up%20%28magazine%29">Rap-Up</a>" listed it among the four best tracks from the album. "New York Times" writer Jon Caramanica considered it "one of the album's most engaging songs" and praised Eminem's ability to assess issues from the perspectives of both sexes. MTV's Rodriguez wrote that the song echoes content from Eminem's earlier albums, but finds him "sober" and "more mature". He added that the lyrics allude to Eminem's relationship with Scott and that "Love the Way You Lie" is his closest approach to a love song. Editors of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" compared the single with "Kim" and 97 Bonnie & Clyde"; they found he is more tempered in "Love the Way You Lie" when discussing a "mutually destructive relationship" and that Rihanna's involvement creates an eerie mood.

Critics especially praised Rihanna's contribution. Michael Menachem of "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" complimented her "exquisitely melodic and surprisingly hopeful" vocal performance and "Eminem's dark, introspective" rapping. He noted that the percussion complements both artists and that Alex da Kid gave the classical arrangement a mainstream touch. Kyle Anderson, writing for MTV, remarked that the song showcases Rihanna's emotional vocals and Eminem's "most intense rhymes about his tumultuous relationships". He regarded "Love the Way You Lie" as an honest, "well-constructed pop song with a killer hook" and likened the "slow-burning" music to that of "<a href="Someone%20like%20You%20%28Adele%20song%29">Someone like You</a>", a 2011 single by the British singer <a href="Adele">Adele</a>. The "<a href="Houston%20Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a>" pop critic <a href="Joey%20Guerra">Joey Guerra</a> commented that Rihanna brought a "sandpaper and silk sheen" to the track.

Critics have commented on the message in the lyrics. Anderson noted a dark theme, while Nick Levine of <a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>, Allie Townsend of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine and Jocelyn Noveck of <a href="The%20Associated%20Press">The Associated Press</a> suggested the previous relationships of both artists influenced the song. Levine gave it four stars out of five. According to Eric Hayden of <a href="The%20Atlantic%20Wire">The Atlantic Wire</a>, the song refers to an alcoholic couple, possibly inspired by Rihanna's relationship with Brown. McAlphine awarded "Love the Way You Lie" four stars out of five. According to him, the song would not have been effective if it had featured only Eminem's point of view and feelings of regret; he wrote that Rihanna's representing the opposite side of the relationship shows "proper storytelling" and "sends a message" because of her breakup with Brown. McAlphine wrote that as a result the song depicts a more realistic abusive relationship and could be featured in a campaign for <a href="women%27s%20shelter">women's shelter</a>s. He praised Eminem's accuracy and understanding of the topic. Winston Robbins from "<a href="Consequence%20of%20Sound">Consequence of Sound</a>" attributed the song's poignancy to Rihanna's past abusive relationship, and a theme of infidelity and abuse.

On the critical side, "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>"'s Jenny McCartney dismissed the metaphors in the chorus and thought the song's topic was over-hyped. She disagreed with the critical praise, arguing that women accept abusive relationships for deeper reasons than sexual and emotional pleasure, such as family and financial issues and helplessness. In an <a href="NPR">NPR</a> article, the writer <a href="Maura%20Johnston">Maura Johnston</a> commented that the lyrics portray Rihanna as the subject of Eminem's violence. <a href="Jay%20Smooth">Jay Smooth</a>, a New York radio personality, responded that "while Eminem explores the psyche of the abuser with an almost disturbing amount of depth and detail," Rihanna's perspective is downplayed and not explained fully. Johnston and Smooth wrote that such imbalances are a prevalent issue in <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a> duets. To Sady Doyle, although "Love the Way You Lie" is one of Eminem's most affecting tracks and finds him remorseful, it does not make up for his past <a href="misogyny">misogynistic</a> actions and hateful songs. Noveck questioned whether the lyrics are "a treatise against (or apology for) domestic violence, or an irresponsible glorification of it? Or, is it something uncomfortable in between?"

Marjorie Gilberg, executive director of the anti-teenage violence group Break the Cycle, commented that "Love the Way You Lie" can teach listeners about the dangers of abusive relationships if interpreted correctly. She believed that because popular culture often depicts what is socially acceptable, people may accept such violence more easily. She added, "One problem, though, ... is that the song reflects myths about domestic violence—myths that lead to <a href="blaming%20the%20victim">blaming the victim</a>." Gilberg said the victim is often accused of being as guilty as the partner but wants to be loved, not abused. <a href="Terry%20O%27Neill%20%28feminist%29">Terry O'Neill</a>, a feminist and the president of the <a href="National%20Organization%20for%20Women">National Organization for Women</a>, criticized the lyric, "But your temper's just as bad as mine is / You're the same as me", saying it is a typical excuse used by abusive men for aggression and that "it's only 2-year-olds and violent men who use violence to get what they want." She added that Rihanna unintentionally glorifies domestic violence in the song despite attempting to fight it.

"Love the Way You Lie" ranked in various best-of-2010 lists. Claire Suddath of "Time" placed it at number five on her top-ten list and wrote, "That this song didn't come across sounding clichéd or tasteless is a testament to both artists' skill." <a href="AOL%20Radio">AOL Radio</a> considered the song the best of 2010 hip hop music, regarding Eminem as imaginative and passionate. It ranked ninth on MTV News' top-twenty-five list. Its editor James Montgomery attributed the song's success to its theme and relation to the artists' past abusive relationships. He concluded, "You cannot write a song any better than that, because that's how this kind of thing happens in real life." "<a href="New%20York%20Post">The New York Post</a>" placed the song at second place on their "top 210 songs from 2010" list and regarded it as a "comeback club anthem." In April 2011, Gabriel Alvarez of "<a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex</a>" magazine ranked it at number 100 on their "100 Best Eminem Songs" list, calling it a love song and praising Rihanna's vocals as beautiful. "Love the Way You Lie" and its accompanying music video were nominated for five <a href="Grammy%20Awards">Grammy Awards</a> at the <a href="2011%20Grammy%20Awards">2011 ceremony</a>, including "<a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Record%20of%20the%20Year">Record of the Year</a>", "<a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Song%20of%20the%20Year">Song of the Year</a>" and "<a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Short%20Form%20Music%20Video">Best Short Form Music Video</a>". It won the <a href="People%27s%20Choice%20Awards">People's Choice Awards</a> for "Favorite Music Video" and "Favorite Song".

"Love the Way You Lie" reached number one on several <a href="record%20chart">record chart</a>s worldwide. It entered the United States' <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> at number two in the issue dated July 10, 2010.

The music video for "Love the Way You Lie" was Eminem's third to be directed by the American filmmaker <a href="Joseph%20Kahn">Joseph Kahn</a>. Despite having planned to shoot a <a href="feature%20film">feature film</a> and stop directing pop videos, Kahn chose to work on "Love the Way You Lie" because, according to him, the song discusses an important topic. This was an opportunity for him to direct a video for Eminem without the comedic themes of their previous collaborations. For the video, Kahn considered the British actor <a href="Dominic%20Monaghan">Dominic Monaghan</a> as a co-star for his versatility, which he thought would help him play an antagonist. Kahn cast the American actress <a href="Megan%20Fox">Megan Fox</a>, which he had presumed would be almost impossible because of her popularity with directors. Fox, a fan of Eminem, accepted the role without hesitation.

Rosenberg gave Kahn one day to write a <a href="film%20treatment">treatment</a>, which Kahn finished in 45 minutes. He filmed Eminem's and Rihanna's parts on July 20, 2010; scenes with Fox and Monaghan were shot three days later. By July 24, 2010, they finished the shoot. Kahn confirmed the completion of the <a href="director%27s%20cut">director's cut</a> the next day. He said Fox's involvement made the video powerful, commenting for "<a href="Vibe%20%28magazine%29">Vibe</a>":
We wanted to make a specific story about two people—Meg and Dom—not a video that was representative of all couples or all domestic violence situations. I'm not saying that all couples fight this way. I just want people just to be able to identify with the characters and recognize that they've seen relationships like this where two people are together that are completely wrong for each other and things spiral out of control. ... Megan was the key to this video. ... I'll tell you as a director the reason why [Fox and Monaghan's] scenes in the video feel so real is because in the moment they were real.
Monaghan told MTV he thought the couple represents Eminem and Scott. The clip was produced by Kathy Angstadt and <a href="MaryAnn%20Tanedo">MaryAnn Tanedo</a> of HSI Productions. Shortly before its release, Eminem reported in a press statement: "Joseph and I worked pretty closely together to make sure we got this right". He said the difficult topic resulted in a powerful video because of the contributions of Rihanna, Fox and Monaghan. Fox donated her appearance fee to the Sojourn House, a battered women's shelter. On August 5, 2010, the video premiered on MTV and the music video website <a href="Vevo">Vevo</a>.

Rihanna sings the chorus in front of a burning house, while an interspersing scene shows fire on a woman's (Fox) palms. In another scene, the woman is asleep with her lover (Monaghan) and wakes up. As Eminem begins to rap in an open field, the woman attacks her lover after seeing the name "Cindy" and a phone number written on his hand. He unsuccessfully tries to kiss the woman and brings her back after she attempts to leave him. The man then pushes her onto the wall and aims his fist at her, puncturing the wall instead. After Rihanna sings again, the video <a href="flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashes back</a> to when the couple first meet "at a seedy dive bar next door" to a liquor store. The man steals a bottle of <a href="vodka">vodka</a> and they kiss on the rooftop.

During the present, the man apologizes to his lover and they are reconciled. In another flashback, he attacks someone who plays <a href="Pool%20%28cue%20sports%29">pool</a> with his lover. Eminem joins Rihanna in front of the burning house for the final verse. Meanwhile, after the flashback, the woman comes home and locks herself in the bathroom to stop her abusive lover from entering. In another scene, the fire on her palms vanishes as she clasps her hands. Flames later engulf Eminem and the couple, who are then shown fighting in front of the burning house. In the end, the couple stays together and the video returns to their first scene, in which they sleep.
The clip broke what was a <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> record at the time of its release for the most views in one day, with 6.6 million. It had a mixed reception from critics, most of whom commented on scenes of domestic violence. NPR's Zoe Chace deemed the video sickening, while <a href="AOL%20Music">AOL Music</a> listed it at number five on their list of the "Top 10 Most Controversial Music Videos in Pop". Stephanie Nilva—the executive director of trauma resource center Day One—told MTV News that it mainly raises "the topic of dating violence among young people". Nilva praised the clip's accurate depiction of patterns in an abusive relationship and thought the video's potency came from Eminem's history of violence-themed songs and Brown's assault on Rihanna.

A writer for "Rap-Up" considered the video realistic, as "art imitates life". Conor Friedersdorf of "The Atlantic" called it an inaccurate portrayal of domestic violence due to insufficient violence, as evidenced by the lack of injuries after punching through a wall. Mariel Concepcion of "Billboard" suggested the video was inspired by the lyric, "Just gonna stand there and watch me burn, but that's alright because I like the way it hurts." Rihanna's appearance was criticized. Writing for "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine, Daniel Kreps called it "especially striking" and noted her relationship with Brown. An editor from "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" commented that although the video is realistic, it hinders Rihanna's ability to set an example for women in abusive relationships. Billy Johnson Jr. from <a href="Yahoo%21%20Music">Yahoo! Music</a> wrote that Fox's character alternated between vulnerable and confrontational personalities, while Monaghan's character is similar to Eminem. Kahn, who understood why viewers thought Eminem's and Rihanna's relationships influenced the video, asked that they realize this is untrue. He said the team had been conscious of such personal matters and Fox's and Monaghan's characters are only significant to each other.

Reviewers discussed the acting. Peter Gicas of "<a href="E%21%20News">E! News</a>" noted that Fox and Monaghan portray "combustible behavior the tune is hellbent on describing." "The New York Post"s Jarett Wieselman wrote that they play their roles perfectly and help make the video powerful. "Entertainment Weekly"s Whitney Pastorek found the violent acting sexually appealing, while Willa Paskin of "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" magazine wrote that the cast's appeal "hypnotize[s]" viewers. Paskin noted the use of <a href="Sepia%20tone">sepia toning</a> in the burning-house scenes. Matthew Wilkening of AOL Radio commented that the video leaves viewers to decide "if it's a good thing or a bad thing that the pair always end up reconciling." Mikey Fresh of "Vibe" commented that Fox's natural reaction when Monaghan pierces the wall and almost hits her is an "incredible act of vulnerability". "<a href="L%20Magazine">L Magazine</a>"s Benjamin Sutton likened the scene in which the characters burn to the <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel Comics</a> character <a href="Chris%20Bradley">Chris Bradley</a>, whom Monaghan portrays in the 2009 action film "". As of February 2019, the video is one of YouTube's 50 most viewed videos. with more than 1.7 billion views.

Eminem has promoted "Love the Way You Lie" at concerts. On June 15, 2010, he and Rihanna performed the song at Los Angeles' <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%202010">Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010</a>, accompanied by the drummer <a href="Travis%20Barker">Travis Barker</a> and <a href="D12">D12</a>'s <a href="Kon%20Artis">Mr. Porter</a>. Eminem sang "Love the Way You Lie" at the Scottish festival <a href="T%20in%20the%20Park%202010">T in the Park</a> on July 10, 2010, dedicating it to "everybody who'[d] been in a fucked-up relationship." He then performed the song at Ireland's annual <a href="Oxegen%202010">Oxegen</a> festival on July 11, 2010. James Hendicott from "<a href="State%20%28magazine%29">State</a>" wrote that the rapper's personality "fill[ed] the stage" and that his vocals were sharp and packed "plenty of punch". He criticized the use of a pre-recorded backing track and noted the lack of live music and female vocals. Eamon Sweeney from the "<a href="Irish%20Independent">Irish Independent</a>" called Eminem's performance only "mildly impressive".

On July 21, 2010, the rapper joined Rihanna on her <a href="Last%20Girl%20on%20Earth%20Tour">Last Girl on Earth Tour</a> to perform in Los Angeles. He then performed at the <a href="2010%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2010 MTV Video Music Awards</a> and was voted the best performer of the ceremony in an MTV poll, earning 34 percent of votes. Rihanna made a surprise appearance despite having said she could not perform because of her schedule. Suddath of "Time" called their duet dull. Eminem sang "Love the Way You Lie" without Rihanna at the 2011 <a href="Bonnaroo%20Music%20Festival">Bonnaroo Music Festival</a> for almost 80,000 people. According to MTV News' Montgomery, the "sheer tenacity with which he attacked" was his strength. Patrick Doyle of "Rolling Stone" felt Eminem delivered a triumphal act by "constantly bouncing across the stage" and singing energetically.

Eminem performed "Love the Way You Lie" on the second day of Chicago's annual <a href="Lollapalooza">Lollapalooza</a> festival on August 6, 2011. Members of the audience sang the chorus to compensate for Rihanna's absence. Piet Levy of "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" named the show a "tragic stunner", while Katie Hasty of <a href="HitFix">HitFix</a> added that it displayed competition between the sexes. Eminem and Rihanna performed in <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a> on the first day of V2011 (<a href="V%20Festival">V Festival</a>), on August 20, 2011. James Lachno of "The Daily Telegraph" considered it an "affecting" rendition. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" called their performance thrilling and an editor for the British newspaper "<a href="Metro%20%28British%20newspaper%29">Metro</a>" felt that it was the best part of the evening. Eminem closed the festival on the night of August 21 in <a href="Chelmsford">Chelmsford</a>, <a href="Essex">Essex</a>, for an audience of 120,000. A reporter for the "<a href="International%20Business%20Times">International Business Times</a>" thought that Eminem's duet with Rihanna was the highlight of the show.

Various musical acts have performed <a href="cover%20version">cover version</a>s of "Love the Way You Lie". <a href="Eric%20Stanley%20%28violinist%29">Eric Stanley</a>, an American violinist, remixed the song on the violin.

Assisted by a guitarist from her band, she began with a section of "Islands" and transitioned into the chorus of "Love the Way You Lie". <a href="Cher%20Lloyd">Cher Lloyd</a>, a British singer, performed the song in the final five of "<a href="The%20X%20Factor%20%28UK%29">The X Factor UK</a>"s <a href="The%20X%20Factor%20%28UK%20series%207%29">seventh season</a>. A writer from "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>" called the performance "stripped-back" and "without any of her usual stage gimmicks." Mernie Gilmore of the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" commented that the song is "a duet for a reason" as Lloyd performed both Eminem's and Rihanna's parts. In 2010, the Russian guitarist <a href="Alex%20Feather%20Akimov">Alex Feather Akimov</a> released "Love The Way You Lie (Heavy Remix)", a recording that was recognized by Billboard.biz (Web Trends). The American <a href="post-hardcore">post-hardcore</a> band <a href="A%20Skylit%20Drive">A Skylit Drive</a> recorded a cover of the single for "<a href="Punk%20Goes%20Pop%204">Punk Goes Pop 4</a>", the 2011 release of the "<a href="Punk%20Goes...">Punk Goes...</a>" series.
On November 3, 2010, an alternative version titled "<a href="Love%20the%20Way%20You%20Lie%20%28Part%20II%29">Love the Way You Lie (Part II)</a>" leaked onto the Internet. Rihanna is the lead vocalist and Eminem is a featured guest. The song mainly views matters from Rihanna's perspective and is based on Grey's demo. Rihanna agreed to record a sequel despite initially thinking "the original couldn't be beaten". She said that the sequel involved less production, with only piano and drums. It is the eleventh and final track on her 2010 studio album "<a href="Loud%20%28Rihanna%20album%29">Loud</a>". Grey's version appears on her 2012 <a href="extended%20play">extended play</a> "The Buried Sessions of Skylar Grey" and her 2013 studio album "<a href="Don%27t%20Look%20Down%20%28Skylar%20Grey%20album%29">Don't Look Down</a>" as "Love the Way You Lie (Part III)".

Rihanna performed a short medley that comprised "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)", "<a href="What%27s%20My%20Name%3F%20%28Rihanna%20song%29">What's My Name?</a>" and "<a href="Only%20Girl%20%28In%20the%20World%29">Only Girl (In the World)</a>" at the <a href="American%20Music%20Awards%20of%202010">American Music Awards of 2010</a>. Another medley, consisting of "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" and "<a href="I%20Need%20a%20Doctor">I Need a Doctor</a>", was performed at the 2011 Grammy Awards. While the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" considered the track an unnecessary sequel, the BBC reviewer James Skinner wrote, Love the Way You Lie (Part II)' even bests the original, Eminem's verse exuding the kind of volatile, simmering menace that got everyone so excited about him in the first place. But it is Rihanna's vocal—at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable—that anchors the song".

Tarrare

Tarrare (c. 1772 – 1798), sometimes spelled Tarare, was a French showman and soldier, noted for his unusual eating habits. Able to eat vast amounts of meat, he was constantly hungry; his parents could not provide for him, and he was turned out of the family home as a teenager. He travelled France in the company of a band of thieves and prostitutes, before becoming the warm-up act to a travelling <a href="charlatan">charlatan</a>; he would swallow corks, stones, live animals and a whole basketful of apples. He then took this act to <a href="Paris">Paris</a> where he worked as a street performer.

At the start of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20First%20Coalition">War of the First Coalition</a>, Tarrare joined the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Army">French Revolutionary Army</a>. With military rations unable to satisfy his large appetite, he would eat any available food from gutters and refuse heaps but his condition still deteriorated through hunger. He was hospitalised due to exhaustion and became the subject of a series of medical experiments to test his eating capacity, in which, among other things, he ate a meal intended for 15 people in a single sitting, ate live cats, snakes, lizards and puppies, and swallowed eels whole without chewing. Despite his unusual diet, he was of normal size and appearance, and showed no signs of mental illness other than what was described as an apathetic temperament.

General <a href="Alexandre%20de%20Beauharnais">Alexandre de Beauharnais</a> decided to put Tarrare's abilities to military use, and he was employed as a courier by the French army, with the intention that he would swallow documents, pass through enemy lines, and recover them from his stool once safely at his destination. Tarrare could not speak German, and on his first mission was captured by <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussian</a> forces, severely beaten and underwent a <a href="mock%20execution">mock execution</a> before being returned to French lines.

Chastened by this experience, he agreed to submit to any procedure that would cure his appetite, and was treated with <a href="laudanum">laudanum</a>, tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for <a href="offal">offal</a> in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in <a href="Versailles%20%28city%29">Versailles</a> with a case of severe <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of <a href="exudative%20diarrhoea">exudative diarrhoea</a>.

Tarrare was born in rural France, near <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a>, around 1772. His date of birth is unrecorded and it is not even known if Tarrare was his real name or a nickname.

As a child, Tarrare had a huge appetite and by his teens could eat a quarter of a <a href="cattle">bullock</a>, weighing as much as Tarrare himself, in a single day. By this time, his parents could not provide for him and had forced him to leave home. For some years after this, he toured the country with a roaming band of thieves and prostitutes, begging and stealing for food, before gaining employment as a warm-up act to a travelling <a href="charlatan">charlatan</a>. Tarrare would draw a crowd by eating corks, stones and live animals, and by swallowing an entire basketful of apples one after the other. He would eat ravenously and was particularly fond of <a href="Snake%23Consumption">snake meat</a>.

In 1788, Tarrare moved to <a href="Paris">Paris</a> to work as a street performer. He appears to have been successful in general, but on one occasion the act went wrong and he had severe <a href="intestinal%20obstruction">intestinal obstruction</a>. Members of the crowd carried him to the <a href="H%C3%B4tel-Dieu%20de%20Paris">Hôtel-Dieu</a> hospital, where he was treated with powerful <a href="laxative">laxative</a>s. He made a full recovery and offered to demonstrate his act by eating his surgeon's watch and chain; M. Giraud, the surgeon, was unimpressed by the offer and warned him that if he did so, he would cut Tarrare open to recover the items.

Despite his unusual diet, Tarrare was slim and of average height. At the age of 17, he weighed only (). He was described as having unusually soft fair hair and an abnormally wide mouth, in which his teeth were heavily stained and on which the lips were almost invisible. When he had not eaten, his skin would hang so loosely that he could wrap the fold of skin from his abdomen around his waist. When full, his abdomen would distend "like a huge balloon". The skin of his cheeks was wrinkled and hung loosely, and when stretched out, he could hold twelve eggs or apples in his mouth. 

His body was hot to the touch and he sweated heavily, he constantly had foul body odour; he was described as stinking "to such a degree that he could not be endured within the distance of twenty paces". This smell would get noticeably worse after he had eaten; his eyes and cheeks would become bloodshot, a visible vapour would rise from his body, and he would become lethargic, during which time he would belch noisily and his jaws would make swallowing motions. He had chronic <a href="diarrhoea">diarrhoea</a>, which was said to be "fetid beyond all conception". Despite his large intake of food, he did not appear either to vomit excessively or to gain weight. Aside from his eating habits, his contemporaries saw no apparent signs of mental illness or unusual behaviour in him, other than an apparently apathetic temperament with "a complete lack of force and ideas".

The cause of Tarrare's behaviour is not known. While there are other documented cases of similar behaviour from the period, none of the subjects other than Tarrare were autopsied and there have been no modern documented cases resembling Tarrare. <a href="Hyperthyroidism">Hyperthyroidism</a> can induce an extreme appetite, rapid weight loss, profuse sweating, heat intolerance, and fine hair. Bondeson (2006) speculates that Tarrare had a damaged <a href="amygdala">amygdala</a>; it is known that injuries to the amygdala in animals can induce <a href="polyphagia">polyphagia</a>.

On the outbreak of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20First%20Coalition">War of the First Coalition</a>, Tarrare joined the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Army">French Revolutionary Army</a>. Unfortunately for him, military rations were insufficient to satisfy his appetite. He would carry out tasks for other soldiers in return for a share of their rations and scavenge on the dungheap for scraps, but this was not enough to satisfy him. He was admitted to the military hospital at <a href="Soultz-Haut-Rhin">Soultz-Haut-Rhin</a> with a case of extreme exhaustion. He was granted quadruple rations but remained hungry; he would scavenge for garbage in gutters and refuse containers, eat the scraps of food left by other patients, and creep into the <a href="apothecary">apothecary</a>'s room to eat the <a href="poultice">poultice</a>s. Military surgeons could not understand his appetite; Tarrare was ordered to remain in the military hospital to take part in physiological experiments designed by Dr. Courville (surgeon to the 9th Hussar Regiment) and George Didier, Baron Percy, surgeon-in-chief of the hospital.
Courville and Percy decided to test Tarrare's capacity for food. A meal had been prepared for 15 labourers near the hospital gates; although generally hospital staff restrained Tarrare in the presence of food, on this occasion Courville allowed him to reach the table undisturbed. Tarrare ate the entire meal of two large meat pies, plates of grease and salt and four gallons of milk, and then immediately fell asleep; Courville noted that Tarrare's belly became taut and inflated like a large balloon. On another occasion Tarrare was presented with a live cat. He tore the cat's abdomen open with his teeth and drank its blood, and proceeded to eat the entire cat aside from its bones, before vomiting up its fur and skin. Following this, hospital staff offered Tarrare a variety of other animals including snakes, lizards and puppies, all of which were eaten; he also swallowed an entire eel without chewing, having first crushed its head with his teeth.

After several months he spent as an experimental case, military authorities began to press for Tarrare to be returned to active duty. Dr. Courville was keen to continue his investigations into Tarrare's eating habits and digestive system, and approached <a href="Alexandre%20de%20Beauharnais">General Alexandre de Beauharnais</a> with a suggestion that Tarrare's unusual abilities and behaviour could be put to military use. A document was placed inside a wooden box which was in turn fed to Tarrare. Two days later, the box was retrieved from his excrement, with the document still in legible condition. Courville proposed to de Beauharnais that Tarrare could thus serve as a military courier, carrying documents securely through enemy territory with no risk of their being found if he were searched.

Tarrare was called on by Beauharnais to demonstrate his abilities before a gathering of the commanders of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Rhine%20%28France%29">Army of the Rhine</a>. Having swallowed the box successfully, Tarrare was given a wheelbarrow filled with of raw bull's lungs and liver as a reward, which he immediately ate in front of the assembled generals.

Following this successful demonstration, Tarrare became employed officially as a spy of the Army of the Rhine. Although General de Beauharnais was convinced of Tarrare's physical capacity to carry messages internally, he was concerned about his mental state and reluctant to entrust him initially with significant military documents. Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near <a href="Neustadt%20an%20der%20Weinstra%C3%9Fe">Neustadt</a>; he was told that the documents were of great military significance, but in reality de Beauharnais had merely written a note asking the colonel to confirm that the message had been received successfully, and if so to return a reply of any potentially useful information about Prussian troop movements.

Tarrare crossed Prussian lines under cover of darkness, disguised as a German peasant. Unable to speak German, he soon attracted the attention of local residents, who alerted the Prussian authorities, and he was captured outside <a href="Landau">Landau</a>. A strip search found nothing suspicious on his person, and despite being whipped by Prussian soldiers, he refused to betray his mission. Brought before the local Prussian commander, General Zoegli, he again refused to talk and was imprisoned. After 24 hours of captivity, Tarrare relented and explained the scheme to his captors. He was chained to a latrine, and eventually, 30 hours after being swallowed, the wooden box emerged. Zoegli was furious when the documents, which Tarrare had said contained vital intelligence, transpired only to be de Beauharnais's dummy message, and Tarrare was taken to a <a href="gallows">gallows</a> and the noose placed around his neck. (Some sources state that Zoegli never retrieved the box, as Tarrare had the presence of mind to recover and eat the stool containing it before it could be seized by the Prussians.) At the last minute, Zoegli relented, and Tarrare was taken down from the scaffold, given a severe beating, and released near the French lines.

Following this incident, Tarrare was desperate to avoid further military service, and returned to the hospital, telling Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his appetite. Percy treated him with <a href="laudanum">laudanum</a> without success; further treatments with <a href="vinegar">wine vinegar</a> and <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a> pills were likewise unsuccessful. Following these failures, Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of soft-<a href="boiled%20egg">boiled egg</a>s, but this also failed to suppress his appetite. Efforts to keep him on any kind of controlled diet failed; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for <a href="offal">offal</a> outside butchers' shops and to fight stray dogs for carrion in gutters, alleys and rubbish heaps. He was also caught several times within the hospital drinking from patients undergoing <a href="bloodletting">bloodletting</a>, and attempting to eat the bodies in the hospital mortuary. Other doctors believed that Tarrare was mentally ill and pressed for him to be transferred to a <a href="lunatic%20asylum">lunatic asylum</a>, but Percy was keen to continue his experiments and Tarrare remained in the military hospital.

After some time, a 14-month-old child disappeared from the hospital, and Tarrare was immediately suspected. Percy was unable or unwilling to defend him, and the hospital staff chased Tarrare from the hospital, to which he never returned.

Four years later, in 1798, a M. Tessier of <a href="Versailles%20%28city%29">Versailles</a> hospital contacted Percy to notify him that a patient of theirs wished to see him. It was Tarrare, now bedridden and weak. Tarrare told Percy that he had swallowed a golden fork two years earlier, which he believed was lodged inside him and causing his current weakness. He hoped that Percy could find some way to remove it. Percy, however, recognised that he had advanced <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. A month later, Tarrare began to experience continuous <a href="exudative%20diarrhoea">exudative diarrhoea</a>, dying shortly afterwards.

The corpse rotted quickly; the surgeons of the hospital refused to dissect it. Tessier, however, wanted to find out how Tarrare differed from the norm internally, and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him. At the autopsy, Tarrare's <a href="gullet">gullet</a> was found to be abnormally wide and when his jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach. His body was found to be filled with <a href="pus">pus</a>, his <a href="liver">liver</a> and <a href="gallbladder">gallbladder</a> were abnormally large, and his stomach was enormous, covered in <a href="Peptic%20ulcer">ulcers</a> and filling most of his abdominal cavity.

The fork was never found.

Holy Thorn Reliquary

The Holy Thorn Reliquary was probably created in the 1390s in Paris for <a href="John%2C%20Duke%20of%20Berry">John, Duke of Berry</a>, to house a <a href="relic">relic</a> of the <a href="Crown%20of%20Thorns">Crown of Thorns</a>. The <a href="reliquary">reliquary</a> was bequeathed to the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> in 1898 by <a href="Ferdinand%20James%20von%20Rothschild">Ferdinand de Rothschild</a> as part of the <a href="Waddesdon%20Bequest">Waddesdon Bequest</a>. It is one of a small number of major goldsmiths' works or "joyaux" that survive from the extravagant world of the courts of the <a href="House%20of%20Valois">Valois</a> royal family around 1400. It is made of gold, lavishly decorated with jewels and pearls, and uses the technique of <a href="vitreous%20enamel">enamelling</a> "en <a href="ronde%20bosse">ronde bosse</a>", or "in the round", which had been recently developed when the reliquary was made, to create a total of 28 three-dimensional figures, mostly in white enamel.

Except at its base the reliquary is slim, with two faces; the front view shows the end of the world and the <a href="Last%20Judgement">Last Judgement</a>, with the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a> and saints above and the <a href="resurrection%20of%20the%20dead">resurrection of the dead</a> below, and the relic of a single long thorn believed to come from the crown of thorns worn by Jesus when he was <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">crucified</a>. The rear view has less extravagant decoration, mostly in plain gold in low <a href="relief">relief</a>, and has doors that opened to display a flat object, now missing, which was presumably another relic.

The reliquary was in the <a href="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> collections from at least the 16th century until the 1860s, when it was replaced by a forgery during a restoration by an art dealer, Salomon Weininger. The fraud remained undetected until well after the original reliquary came to the British Museum. The reliquary was featured in the BBC's <a href="A%20History%20of%20the%20World%20in%20100%20Objects">A History of the World in 100 Objects</a>, in which <a href="Neil%20MacGregor">Neil MacGregor</a> described it as "without question one of the supreme achievements of medieval European metalwork", and was a highlight of the exhibition "Treasures of Heaven: Saints, Relics, and Devotion in Medieval Europe" at the British Museum from June 23 to October 2011.

King <a href="Louis%20IX%20of%20France">Louis IX of France</a> bought what he believed to be the authentic Crown of Thorns in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in 1239, and individual thorns were distributed as gifts by subsequent French kings. John, Duke of Berry (1340–1416), brother of King <a href="Charles%20V%20of%20France">Charles V of France</a>, had this reliquary made to house a single thorn; it was probably made a few years before he commissioned his famous <a href="Tr%C3%A8s%20Riches%20Heures%20du%20Duc%20de%20Berry">Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry</a>, and some years after he commissioned the <a href="Royal%20Gold%20Cup">Royal Gold Cup</a>, also in the British Museum. Previously dated between 1401 and 1410, from evidence in John Cherry's book of 2010 the reliquary is now thought to have been made before 1397; based on the heraldic forms used, the museum now dates it to 1390–97. The Holy Thorn Reliquary was later thought to have been in the possession of <a href="Louis%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Louis I, Duke of Orléans</a>, but all recent writers prefer his uncle, the Duke of Berry.

Its location is unknown until an inventory of 1544, when it belonged to <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor%20Charles%20V">Holy Roman Emperor Charles V</a>, perhaps as an inheritance from his ancestors the Valois <a href="Dukes%20of%20Burgundy">Dukes of Burgundy</a>. It presumably passed to the Austrian branch of the <a href="Habsburg">Habsburg</a>s on Charles V's death, as it is listed in several inventories of the Imperial <a href="Schatzkammer%20%28Vienna%29">Schatzkammer</a> ("treasure chamber") in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> from 1677 onwards. It remained in Vienna until after 1860, when it appeared in an exhibition. Some time after this it was sent to be restored by Salomon Weininger, an art dealer with access to skilled craftsmen, who secretly made a number of copies. He was later convicted of other forgeries, and died in prison in 1879, but it was still not realised that he had returned one of his copies of the reliquary to the Imperial collections instead of the original. The Viennese <a href="Rothschild%20family">Rothschild family</a> bought the original reliquary by 1872, in ignorance of its <a href="provenance">provenance</a>; it was inherited by Ferdinand de Rothschild, who moved to England, and built <a href="Waddesdon%20Manor">Waddesdon Manor</a> in <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>. One of the copies remained in the <a href="Schatzkammer">Ecclesiastical Treasury</a> of the Imperial Habsburg Court in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, where the deception remained undetected for several decades.

The original reliquary reached the British Museum as part of the Waddesdon Bequest in 1899, by which time its origins had been "completely lost" and it was described as "Spanish, 16th Century". Thus its history had to be reconstructed through scholarship; the meaning of the heraldic plaques on the castle base had by now been lost in both London and Vienna. The first publication to assert that the London reliquary was the one recorded in earlier Viennese inventories was an article by Joseph Destrée in 1927; the matter was not finally settled until 1959 when the Viennese version was brought to London to enable close comparison. The assembled experts from the British Museum, <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> and <a href="Kunsthistorisches%20Museum">Kunsthistorisches Museum</a> in Vienna agreed that the London reliquary was the original. Under the terms of the Waddesdon Bequest the reliquary cannot leave the museum; in 2011 it was omitted from the <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a> and <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> legs of the exhibition "Treasures of Heaven: Saints, Relics, and Devotion in Medieval Europe". Normally it is on display in Room 45, the dedicated Waddesdon Bequest Room, as specified in the terms of the bequest.

The Holy Thorn Reliquary is made of gold, <a href="vitreous%20enamel">enamel</a>, <a href="hardstone%20carving">rock crystal</a>, pearls, rubies and sapphires. It is just over high and weighs . There are some areas of damage (including what appears to be deliberate removal of enamel in the 19th century), and small losses and repairs; but generally the reliquary is in good condition. The central front compartment holding the relic is protected by a thin pane of rock crystal, which has kept it in perfect condition. The enamel is mostly in "ronde bosse" technique, applied to three-dimensional figures, with white as the dominant colour. At the time, white enamel using <a href="lead">lead</a> had been only recently developed and was very fashionable, dominating many contemporary "ronde bosse" works. There is also red, green, blue, pink, and black enamel. Pure gold is used throughout, which is rare even in royal commissions of such pieces at this period; most use cheaper <a href="silver-gilt">silver-gilt</a> for the structural framework.

The jewels, which would have been keenly appreciated by contemporary viewers, include two large sapphires, one above <a href="God%20the%20Father%20in%20Western%20art">God the Father</a> at the very top of the reliquary, where it may have represented heaven, and the other below Christ, on which the thorn is mounted. The gold elements framing God the Father and the central compartment with Christ and the thorn are decorated with alternating rubies and pearls, totalling fourteen of each. All the gemstones have the smooth and polished <a href="cabochon">cabochon</a> cut normal in medieval jewellery, and though they are set in the reliquary with gold "claws", all are drilled through as though for threading on a necklace, suggesting that they are re-used from another piece. There may have been other jewels now lost, for example mounted in two holes on either side of the door of the castle-like base.

The design of the front face is based on the general <a href="resurrection%20of%20the%20dead">resurrection of the dead</a> following the <a href="Last%20Judgment">Last Judgment</a>. At the top sits God the Father, above two angels. A small hole at the level of their knees shows where a dove representing the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> was originally attached; with Christ below, all three persons of the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a> were therefore represented. A round-topped compartment protected by a rock-crystal "window" holds the relic itself and the group around Christ. <a href="Christ%20in%20Judgment">Christ in Judgment</a> is shown seated displaying the <a href="Holy%20Wounds">wounds of his crucifixion</a>, with his feet resting on the globe of the world, and making a blessing gesture. As with all the enamelled figures that are still extant, the hair is in gold, the main robe is in white, and the flesh is in white with coloured eyes and lips, a touch of pink on the cheeks. Behind Christ the <a href="celestial%20spheres">celestial spheres</a> are represented like a rainbow, and above him fly two angels holding <a href="Instruments%20of%20the%20Passion">Instruments of the Passion</a>, including the <a href="crown%20of%20thorns">crown of thorns</a> over his head; behind him a cross in shallow relief emerges from the curved gold background. The thorn relic rises below and in front of him, mounted on a "monstrously large sapphire".

To the left and right of Christ are shown <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a> and the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a> in supplicant poses, <a href="Deesis">a traditional grouping</a>; John was also one of the Duke's <a href="patron%20saint">patron saint</a>s. Around the central scene small figures of the <a href="twelve%20Apostles">twelve Apostles</a> carrying their identifying <a href="emblem">attributes</a> emerge from the foliage border of oak leaves and tendrils; the uppermost heads on each side are replacements, probably by Weininger in the 1860s.
Below this upper section there is a gold scroll label with the Latin inscription "" ("This is a thorn from the crown / Of Our Lord Jesus Christ") in black enamel filling the engraved letters. Below the inscription is a scene showing the mass resurrection of naked people rising from their graves on the <a href="Day%20of%20Judgement">Day of Judgement</a>. On a green enamel mound like a hillside are four naked figures, two men and two women, emerging from tiny gold coffins whose lids have been upturned on the ground; the women wear white caps. Four angels blowing horns sound the "Last Trump" of the <a href="Book%20of%20Revelation">Book of Revelation</a>, standing on the turrets of a tiny castle which serves as the base of the reliquary.

The Last Judgement was an especially appropriate subject for setting a relic from the Crown of Thorns. Some thought that the crown was held by the French kings on loan, and would be reclaimed by Christ on the Day of Judgement—a belief expressed in the <a href="antiphon">antiphon</a> sung at <a href="Sens%20Cathedral">Sens Cathedral</a> in 1239 to celebrate the arrival of the main relic.

Two panels on the walls of the castle are patterned with the <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> of the Duke of Berry, and their form has been crucial for establishing the <a href="provenance">provenance</a> and date of the work. Two of the angels with horns have blue <a href="fleurs-de-lis">fleurs-de-lis</a> on their robes; the other two, patterns of dots in blue. All the arches of the castle are semicircular, and in fact the whole reliquary lacks any Gothic pointed arches, even among the tracery—a sign of advanced artistic taste at the time. In this respect the Holy Thorn Reliquary contrasts strongly with the "Tableau of the Trinity" in the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a> (possibly made in London), whose framework is a forest of <a href="crocket">crocket</a>ed Gothic <a href="pinnacle">pinnacle</a>s, although estimates of its date cover the same period as the reliquary.

The rear face is plainer, with no jewels, but still highly decorated; Cherry speculates that it may originally have been much more simple and not designed for viewing, with most of the other elements added after it was originally made. At the top is a medallion with the face of Christ set in a <a href="sunburst">sunburst</a>. The central round-topped area contains two doors, secured with a small gold pin, containing full-length gold figures in <a href="relief">relief</a>, <a href="Repouss%C3%A9%20and%20chasing">chased</a> in gold, a feature unique to this reliquary. On the left door is the <a href="archangel">archangel</a> <a href="Saint%20Michael">Saint Michael</a>, spearing a dragon representing the devil. He was both the <a href="patron%20saint">patron saint</a> of the French monarchy, and also traditionally the person responsible for supervising the chaotic crowds at the Last Judgement, when he is often shown in art weighing souls in a pair of scales. On the right is <a href="Saint%20Christopher">Saint Christopher</a>, carrying the <a href="Christ%20child">Christ child</a> on his shoulders, who raises his hand in blessing. There was a popular belief that sight of an image of Saint Christopher meant that a person would not die on that day without receiving the <a href="Last%20Rites">Last Rites</a>, which may well explain his presence here.

In the fake in Vienna, the figures of both saints are enamelled; flesh is white, Michael and the Christ child have red robes, and Christopher blue, and the saints stand on a brownish dragon and blue water respectively, with green grass below both of these. Some scholars have thought it unlikely that the forger invented this scheme, and therefore presumed that he copied enamel on the original that has been removed in the 19th century, probably because it was damaged—sections of enamel cannot be patched up, but must be removed completely and redone. However John Cherry believes this and other changes in the enamel of the Vienna version are elaborations by Weininger and his craftsmen; for example in Vienna the wings of the trumpeting angels are coloured. The two figures are in a sophisticated "soft and flowing" <a href="International%20Gothic">International Gothic</a> style executed with great virtuosity; Michael's staff is detached from the background over most of its length and is one of a number of elements that extend outside the frame of the door. If there was once enamel on the two figures it would have been at least mainly in more fragile translucent enamels, as the very fine working of many details of them was clearly intended to be seen. The rougher working of the surfaces at the bottom of the doors: the dragon below St Michael, the water below St Christopher, and the ground below both of these, suggests that the missing original enamels were opaque in these areas. But all the extra enamel in Vienna is opaque, including the saints' figures, and the effect of the more intense colours is "lurid" and "offends our eyes because of its crudity".

When the pin is removed and the small doors opened, there is now nothing to see but "a flat layer of plaster, with a sheet of nineteenth-century paper or <a href="vellum">vellum</a> in front of it". Whatever was designed to be displayed has now gone; it must have been flat, and was perhaps another relic, probably a textile, or a picture on vellum. The <a href="Veil%20of%20Veronica">Veil of Veronica</a>, in either form, is a possibility; the face of Christ at the top in a circular setting often represents this. Outside the doors the foliate border of the front is continued, uninterrupted by figures. Below two of the angels with trumpets can be seen, with an unpopulated stretch of the green hillside, and below it the back of the castle base, which has apparently had another arched "leg" in the centre crudely removed, leaving a jagged edge, and also making the reliquary rather less stable.

<br>
The maker of the work is unknown; it is not signed or marked, and goldsmiths of the period rarely did this. There are a number of goldsmiths' names known from accounts and other records, but none of the few surviving works can be attached to a particular maker. Paris was the centre of production for the great numbers of "joyaux", secular and religious, produced for the extended <a href="House%20of%20Valois">Valois</a> royal family and other buyers. Berry and his brothers and nephews had goldsmiths on salaries or retainers for what must have been a continuous flow of commissions, whose results are tersely catalogued in various inventories of the period, but of which there are now only a handful of survivals. Only one item mentioned in the records of the Berry collection might match the reliquary, but this was made after 1401, which conflicts with the date suggested by the heraldry. Another possibility is that the reliquary was made and given as a gift, as many such pieces were, in between inventories.

The reliquary exuberantly exploits the "<a href="ronde%20bosse">ronde bosse</a>" or "encrusted" enamelling technique, which involves creating small three-dimensional figures coated in enamel on a metal core, often just gold wire. The technique was a recent innovation which the goldsmiths working for the Valois were pushing to its limits at the end of the 14th century. The main colour of enamel used is a lead-based white, which had also only been developed a decade or two at most before the date of the reliquary, and was evidently very fashionable at the end of the century. White dominates the few surviving large enamels in "ronde bosse" dated to the period beginning about 1380 and ending about 1410, used as here for both the clothes and flesh of the figures. Gold is used for their hair, and other enamel colours are mostly used at the neck and cuffs to demarcate between white robes and white flesh; "throughout, colour is used in a very considered way"; "a controlled use of red includes the alternation of rubies and pearls", except where "a single sapphire interrupts this rhythm" above God the Father. Blue, an important enamel colour in other works, is almost entirely absent here, perhaps so as not to overshadow the large sapphires. 
Other techniques are also used with a great degree of skill; the large figures on the rear are chased, with St Michael's wings being represented on the flat surface of the door in delicate stippled or <a href="pointill%C3%A9">pointillé</a> work using <a href="Punch%20%28tool%29">punches</a>, which is too detailed to see in most photographs, and indeed hard to see on the original. Michael's body is also feathered, stopping at the neck, ankles and wrists, a "most exceptional feature" often referred to as "<a href="feather%20tights">feather tights</a>", that perhaps borrows from the costumes of <a href="liturgical%20drama">liturgical drama</a>s. Other elements were cast in small moulds, and most of the visible gold has been burnished to give a smooth and shining appearance.

<a href="John%2C%20Duke%20of%20Berry">Jean, duc de Berry</a> (1340–1416), or the "excellent puissant Prince Jehan filz de roy de France Duc de Berry" ("excellent and powerful prince Jean, son of the king of France, Duke of Berry"), as his secretary inscribed one of his manuscripts, was the third of the four sons of King <a href="John%20II%20of%20France">John II of France</a>—<a href="Charles%20V%20of%20France">Charles V</a>, <a href="Louis%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Anjou">Louis I, Duke of Anjou</a> (1339–1384), Berry and <a href="Philip%20the%20Bold">Philip the Bold</a>, <a href="Duke%20of%20Burgundy">Duke of Burgundy</a> (1342–1404). All commissioned great numbers of works of art in various media, and in particular spent huge sums on works in gold and silver. Although it is Berry who is especially remembered as a patron, partly because he specialized in <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a>s which have little value in their materials and so have not been recycled, his brother Louis of Anjou had over 3,000 pieces of plate at one point. These included wholly secular pieces with sculptures in enamel that can only be imagined by comparison as regards technique to the handful of reliquaries, like the Holy Thorn Reliquary, that have survived from the period, and as regards subject matter to tapestries and some secular illuminated manuscripts. There are extremely detailed inventories of Berry's possessions including ones from 1401–1403 and 1413–1416, however none contain an entry whose description matches the reliquary.

Soon after Berry's death in 1416, the bulk of his treasures were seized and melted down by the English, who were occupying much of northern France after their victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Agincourt">Battle of Agincourt</a> the previous year. That the reliquary escaped this fate suggests it may have been given away by Berry, perhaps to his Burgundian cousins, in whose family it is next recorded (the Burgundian heiress <a href="Mary%20of%20Burgundy">Mary of Burgundy</a> married the Habsburg <a href="Maximilian%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor</a> in 1477). A reliquary that was donated to the church had a better chance of surviving than the similar secular works that are now only known from their descriptions in inventories, where scenes of courtly pleasure were depicted with portrait figures of the princes and their friends. A work belonging to Berry's elder brother Anjou showed the romance of "<a href="Tristan%20and%20Isolde">Tristan and Isolde</a>", with King Mark spying on the lovers from a tree above them, giving himself away when they see "the enamelled reflection of his face in the enamelled brook". 
One work that survived long enough to be recorded in an 18th-century painting had a very similar gold castle as its base, with a paradisal garden within the walls, in this case with trees bearing pearls and red gems. However the rest of the piece was very different in scale, with a single large white enamel figure of the Archangel Michael impaling <a href="Satan">Satan</a> with a lance-like jewelled cross, completely out of scale with the garden in which he stands. This is the "St Michael and the Devil Group", which can be reliably dated to before 1397, when it was given to King <a href="Charles%20VI%20of%20France">Charles VI of France</a>, Berry's nephew, as a New Year's gift by another uncle, Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. It later passed to a church at <a href="Ingolstadt">Ingolstadt</a> in <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, where it remained until it was destroyed in 1801.

Berry was religious as well as worldly, and collected relics as keenly as other types of objects. By 1397 both of his sons had died, he was in his late fifties, and he had begun to think of his tomb, finally deciding to build a new "Sainte Chapelle" in his capital of <a href="Bourges">Bourges</a> to house it. His collection of relics included objects claimed to be the wedding ring of the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a>, a cup used at the <a href="Wedding%20at%20Cana">Wedding at Cana</a>, a piece of the <a href="Burning%20Bush">Burning Bush</a> and many others. However the <a href="provenance">provenance</a> of the Holy Thorn, as well as its centrality to the <a href="Passion%20of%20Christ">Passion of Christ</a> must have given it a special status. The crown from which the thorn came had been bought in 1239 by <a href="Louis%20IX">Louis IX</a>, both a saint and King of France, from the <a href="Latin%20Empire">Latin Emperor in Constantinople</a>, <a href="Baldwin%20II%20of%20Constantinople">Baldwin II</a>, along with a portion of the <a href="True%20Cross">True Cross</a>. Both had been in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> since the <a href="Muslim%20Conquest">Muslim Conquest</a> of the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a> in the 7th century, and may very well be the same relics that Bishop <a href="Paulinus%20of%20Nola">Paulinus of Nola</a> saw in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> in 409. There are a <a href="Crown%20of%20thorns%23Purported%20remnants">number of other thorn relics</a> said to have come from the relic in the Paris "Sainte Chapelle", including the far smaller Salting Reliquary in the British Museum, a French <a href="pendant">pendant</a> of about 1340.

Berry may have kept the reliquary with him on his round of visits to his many castles and palaces, or it may have been kept in a chapel, perhaps the Bourges "Sainte Chapelle", built in emulation of the king's Paris "<a href="Sainte%20Chapelle">Sainte Chapelle</a>", where the Crown of Thorns itself was kept. The reliquary is relatively small and would almost certainly have had a custom-made carrying case like that for the Royal Gold Cup, in which the cup came to the British Museum.

History of Gibraltar

The history of Gibraltar, a small peninsula on the southern <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian</a> coast near the entrance of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, spans over 2,900 years. The peninsula has evolved from a place of reverence in ancient times into "one of the most densely fortified and fought-over places in Europe", as one historian has put it. <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>'s location has given it an outsized significance in the history of Europe and its fortified town, established in medieval times, has hosted garrisons that sustained numerous sieges and battles over the centuries.

Gibraltar was first inhabited over 50,000 years ago by <a href="Neanderthal">Neanderthal</a>s and may have been one of their <a href="Neanderthals%20of%20Gibraltar">last places of habitation</a> before they died out around 24,000 years ago. Gibraltar's <a href="recorded%20history">recorded history</a> began around 950 BC with the <a href="Phoenicians">Phoenicians</a>, who lived nearby. The <a href="Carthaginians">Carthaginians</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a> later worshipped <a href="Hercules">Hercules</a> in shrines said to have been built on the <a href="Rock%20of%20Gibraltar">Rock of Gibraltar</a>, which they called "Mons Calpe", the "Hollow Mountain", and which they regarded as one of the twin <a href="Pillars%20of%20Hercules">Pillars of Hercules</a>.

Gibraltar became part of the <a href="Visigothic%20Kingdom">Visigothic Kingdom</a> of <a href="Hispania">Hispania</a> following the collapse of the Roman Empire and came under Muslim <a href="Moors">Moorish</a> rule in 711 AD. It was <a href="Moorish%20Gibraltar">permanently settled for the first time</a> by the Moors and was renamed "Jebel Tariq" – the Mount of Tariq, later corrupted into "Gibraltar". The Christian <a href="Crown%20of%20Castile">Crown of Castile</a> annexed it in 1309, lost it again to the Moors in 1333 and finally regained it in 1462. Gibraltar became part of the unified <a href="Spain">Kingdom of Spain</a> and remained under Spanish rule until 1704. It was captured during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a> by an <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">Anglo</a>-<a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch</a> fleet in the name of <a href="Charles%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles VI of Austria</a>, the <a href="House%20of%20Habsburg">Habsburg</a> contender to the Spanish throne. At the war's end, Spain ceded the territory to <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Britain</a> under the terms of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Utrecht">Treaty of Utrecht</a> of 1713.

Spain tried to regain control of Gibraltar, which Britain had declared a <a href="Crown%20colony">Crown colony</a>, through military, diplomatic and economic pressure. Gibraltar was besieged and heavily bombarded during three wars between Britain and Spain but the attacks were repulsed on each occasion. By the end of the last siege, in the late 18th century, Gibraltar had faced fourteen sieges in 500 years. In the years after <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Trafalgar</a>, Gibraltar became a major base in the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a>. The colony grew rapidly during the 19th and early 20th centuries, becoming a key British possession in the Mediterranean. It was a key stopping point for vessels en route to <a href="India">India</a> via the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>. A large British naval base was constructed there at great expense at the end of the 19th century and became the backbone of Gibraltar's economy.

British control of Gibraltar enabled the Allies to control the entrance to the Mediterranean during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. It was attacked on several occasions by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italian</a> and <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy French</a> forces, though without causing much damage. The Spanish dictator General <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a> declined to join a Nazi plan to occupy Gibraltar but revived Spain's claim to the territory after the war. As the territorial dispute intensified, Spain closed its border with Gibraltar between 1969 and 1985 and communications links were severed. Spain's position was supported by Latin American countries but was rejected by Britain and the <a href="Gibraltarian%20people">Gibraltarians</a> themselves, who vigorously asserted their right to <a href="self-determination">self-determination</a>. Discussions of Gibraltar's status have continued between Britain and Spain but have not reached any conclusion.

Since 1985, Gibraltar has undergone major changes as a result of reductions in Britain's overseas defence commitments. Most British forces have left the territory, which is no longer seen as a place of major military importance. Its economy is now based on <a href="Tourism%20in%20Gibraltar">tourism</a>, financial services, <a href="Shipping%20in%20Gibraltar">shipping</a> and Internet gambling. Gibraltar is largely self-governed, with <a href="Parliament%20of%20Gibraltar">its own parliament</a> and <a href="Government%20of%20Gibraltar">government</a>, though the UK maintains responsibility for defence and foreign policy. Its economic success has made it one of the wealthiest areas of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>.

The history of Gibraltar has been driven by its strategic position near the entrance of the Mediterranean Sea. It is a narrow peninsula at the eastern side of the <a href="Bay%20of%20Gibraltar">Bay of Gibraltar</a>, from the city of <a href="Algeciras">Algeciras</a>. Gibraltar is on the far south coast of Spain at one of the narrowest points in the Mediterranean, only from the coast of <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> in North Africa. Its position on the bay makes it an advantageous natural anchorage for ships. As one writer has put it, "whoever controls Gibraltar also controls the movement of ships into and out of the Mediterranean. In terms of military and naval power, few places have a more strategic location than Gibraltar."

The territory's area measures only . Most of the land area is occupied by the steeply sloping Rock of Gibraltar which reaches a height of . The town of Gibraltar lies at the base of the Rock on the west side of the peninsula. A narrow, low-lying isthmus connects the peninsula to the Spanish mainland. The North Face of the Rock is a nearly vertical cliff high overlooking the isthmus; the only land access to the town is via a coastal strip about wide, which was considerably narrower before the <a href="Land%20reclamation">reclamation of land</a> from the sea during the 20th century.

Gibraltar's geography has thus given it considerable natural defensive advantages. It is virtually impossible to scale the eastern or northern sides of the Rock, which are either vertical or nearly so. To the south, the relatively flat area around <a href="Europa%20Point">Europa Point</a> is surrounded by cliffs which are up to high. The western side is the only practicable area for a landing, but even here the steep slopes on which the town is built work to the advantage of a defender. These factors have given it an enormous military significance over the centuries.

Gibraltar's appearance in prehistory was very different. Whereas today it is surrounded by sea, the water level was much lower in prehistoric times, when the polar ice caps were larger. The current peninsula was surrounded by a fertile coastal plain, with marshes and sand dunes supporting an abundant variety of animals and plants.

<a href="Neanderthals%20of%20Gibraltar">Neanderthals</a> are known to have lived in caves around the Rock of Gibraltar; in 1848 <a href="Gibraltar%201">the first known adult Neanderthal skull</a>, and only the second Neanderthal fossil ever found, was excavated at <a href="Forbes%27%20Quarry">Forbes' Quarry</a> on the north face of the Rock. Had the skull been recognised for what it was, the species might have been named Gibraltarians rather than Neanderthals. The date of the skull is unclear but it has been attributed to around the start of the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a> about 50,000 years ago.

More Neanderthal remains have been found elsewhere on the Rock at <a href="Devil%27s%20Tower%20%28Gibraltar%29">Devil's Tower</a> and in <a href="Ibex%20Cave">Ibex</a>, <a href="Vanguard%20Cave">Vanguard</a> and <a href="Gorham%27s%20Cave">Gorham's Cave</a>s on the east side of Gibraltar. Excavations in Gorham's Cave have found evidence of Neanderthal occupation dated as recently as 28,000–24,000 years ago, well after they were believed to have died out elsewhere in Europe. The caves of Gibraltar continued to be used by "<a href="Homo%20sapiens">Homo sapiens</a>" after the final extinction of the Neanderthals. Stone tools, ancient hearths and animal bones dating from around 40,000 years ago to about 5,000 years ago have been found in deposits left in Gorham's Cave. Numerous potsherds dating from the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> period have been found in Gibraltar's caves, mostly of types typical of the <a href="Prehistoric%20Iberia">Almerian culture</a> found elsewhere in Andalusia, especially around the town of <a href="Almer%C3%ADa">Almería</a>, from which it takes its name. There is little evidence of habitation in the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>, when people had largely abandoned the tradition of living in caves.
During ancient times, Gibraltar was regarded by the peoples of the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The <a href="Phoenicians">Phoenicians</a> were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a shrine to the "<a href="genius%20loci">genius loci</a>" of the place, as did the <a href="Carthaginians">Carthaginians</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a> after them. Excavations in the cave have shown that pottery, jewellery and <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian</a> <a href="Scarab%20%28artifact%29">scarab</a>s were left as offerings to the gods, probably in the hope of securing safe passage through the dangerous waters of the <a href="Strait%20of%20Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</a>.

The Rock was revered by the Greeks and Romans as one of the two <a href="Pillars%20of%20Hercules">Pillars of Hercules</a>, created by the demigod during his when he smashed through a mountain separating the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. According to a <a href="Phocaea">Phocaea</a>n Greek traveller who visited in the sixth century BC, there were temples and altars to Hercules on the Rock where passing travellers made sacrifices. The Spanish later symbolised the importance of the Pillars of Hercules with consisting of a pair of columns with a scroll wrapped around them – a symbol that became the <a href="dollar%20sign">$ sign</a> and the related Portuguese "<a href="cifr%C3%A3o">cifrão</a>" ().

To the Ancient Romans, Gibraltar was known as "Mons Calpe", a name perhaps derived from the <a href="Phoenician%20language">Phoenician word</a> "kalph", "hollowed out", presumably in reference to the many <a href="List%20of%20caves%20in%20Gibraltar">limestone caves in the Rock</a>. It was well-known to ancient geographers, but there is no known archaeological evidence of permanent settlements from the ancient period. According to the Roman writer <a href="Avienus">Avienus</a>, the ancient Greek traveller <a href="Euctemon">Euctemon</a> recorded that

There were more mundane reasons not to settle, as Gibraltar had many disadvantages that were to hinder later settlers. It lacked easily accessible fresh water, fertile soil or a safe natural anchorage on the shoreline. Avienus cited the "shallow draft and dense mud of the shore" as reasons not to land there. Its geographical location, which later became its key strategic asset, was not a significant factor during the Classical period as the entrance to the Mediterranean was not contested by the states of the day.

For these reasons the ancients instead settled at the head of the bay in what is today known as the <a href="Campo%20de%20Gibraltar">"Campo" (hinterland) of Gibraltar</a>. The town of <a href="Carteia">Carteia</a>, near the location of the modern Spanish town of <a href="San%20Roque%2C%20C%C3%A1diz">San Roque</a>, was founded by the Phoenicians around 950 BC on the site of an early settlement of the native <a href="Turdetani">Turdetani</a> people. The Carthaginians took control of the town by 228 BC and it was captured by the Romans in 206 BC. It subsequently became <a href="Pompey">Pompey</a>'s western base in his campaign of 67 BC against the pirates that menaced the Mediterranean Sea at the time. Carteia appears to have been abandoned after the <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a> sacked it in 409 AD during their march through Roman <a href="Hispania">Hispania</a> to <a href="Africa%20%28Roman%20province%29">Africa</a>. The region subsequently fell under the rule of the Christianised <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a>.

By 681 the armies of the <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Umayyad Caliphate</a> had expanded from their original homeland of <a href="Arabia">Arabia</a> to conquer North Africa, the Middle East and large parts of West Asia, bringing Islam in their wake and converting local peoples to the new religion. The <a href="Berbers">Berbers</a> of North Africa, called <a href="Moors">Moors</a> by the Christians, thereby became Muslims. The Strait of Gibraltar became the frontier between Muslim North Africa and Christian <a href="Hispania">Hispania</a> and thus gained a new strategic significance. Hispania descended into civil war in the 8th century as rival Visigothic factions fought for control of the throne. This gave the Moors the opportunity to invade Hispania and pursue a course of dividing-and-conquering the Christian factions.

Following a raid in 710, a predominately Berber army under the command of <a href="Tariq%20ibn%20Ziyad">Tariq ibn Ziyad</a> crossed from North Africa in April 711 and landed somewhere in the vicinity of Gibraltar (though most likely not in the bay or at the Rock itself). Although Tariq's expedition was an outstanding success and led to the <a href="Umayyad%20conquest%20of%20Hispania">Islamic conquest of most of the Iberian peninsula</a>, he ended his career in disgrace after falling out with the Arab general <a href="Musa%20bin%20Nusayr">Musa bin Nusayr</a>. His conquest nonetheless left a long-lasting legacy for Gibraltar: "Mons Calpe" was renamed "Jebel Tariq", the Mount of Tariq, subsequently corrupted into "Gibraltar".

Gibraltar was fortified for the first time in 1160 by the <a href="Almohad">Almohad</a> Sultan <a href="Abd%20al-Mu%27min">Abd al-Mu'min</a> in response to the coastal threat posed by the Christian kings of <a href="Aragon">Aragon</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Castile</a>. Gibraltar was renamed "Jebel al-Fath" (the Mount of Victory), though this name did not persist, and a fortified town named "Medinat al-Fath" (the City of Victory) was laid out on the upper slopes of the Rock. It is unclear how much of Medinat al-Fath was actually built, as the surviving archaeological remains are scanty.

In the late thirteen and early fourteenth centuries the <a href="Crown%20of%20Castile">Crown of Castile</a> fought with the <a href="Marinids">Marinids</a> of Morocco and the <a href="Nasrid%20dynasty">Nasrids</a> of <a href="Emirate%20of%20Granada">Granada</a> for control of the Strait of Gibraltar. This conflict () is a major chapter in the history of the Christian reconquest of Spain. Although no documentary account of Gibraltar is available for the period following the creation of Madinat al-Fath, there are reasons to believe that a small fortified town existed in Gibraltar, and that its existence was the direct consequence of the fall of <a href="Tarifa">Tarifa</a> in 1292. After the capture of the city, it was expected that the Castilian king <a href="Sancho%20IV%20of%20Castile">Sancho IV</a> would lay siege to <a href="Algeciras">Algeciras</a> (though in the event, he did not do so) to hinder the Marinids' communications with the Iberian peninsula. The threatening presence of a Christian stronghold to the west would have made it necessary to set up a garrison to the east of Algeciras. That way, Gibraltar would protect the <a href="rearguard">rearguard</a> of Algeciras and provided a fallback position if the town fell. At the same time, the heights of the Rock of Gibraltar provided an excellent vantage point for monitoring the activities of the Christian fleets in the Straits.

It was not until 1309 when Gibraltar's defences were put to the test for the first time in the <a href="First%20Siege%20of%20Gibraltar">First Siege of Gibraltar</a>. That year <a href="Ferdinand%20IV%20of%20Castile">Ferdinand IV of Castile</a> and <a href="James%20II%20of%20Aragon">James II of Aragon</a> joined forces to attack the Muslim <a href="Emirate%20of%20Granada">Emirate of Granada</a>, targeting <a href="Almer%C3%ADa">Almería</a> in the east and Algeciras, across the bay from Gibraltar, in the west. In July 1309 the Castilians laid siege to both <a href="Siege%20of%20Algeciras%20%281309%E2%80%931310%29">Algeciras</a> and Gibraltar. By this time the latter had a modest population of around 1,200 people, a castle and rudimentary fortifications. They proved unequal to the task of keeping out the Castilians and Gibraltar's Nasrid defenders surrendered after a month. Ferdinand gave up the siege of Algeciras the following February but held on to Gibraltar, expelling the Moors and repopulating it with Christians. A keep and dockyard were built on his orders to secure Castile's hold on the peninsula. Ferdinand also issued a <a href="letters%20patent">letters patent</a> granting privileges to the inhabitants to encourage people to settle, as it was initially not regarded as a particularly hospitable place to live.

In 1315 the Nasrid Moors of Granada <a href="Second%20Siege%20of%20Gibraltar">attempted to recapture Gibraltar</a> but abandoned a brief siege when a Castilian relief force appeared. Eighteen years later, the Nasrid Sultan of Granada, <a href="Muhammed%20IV%2C%20Sultan%20of%20Granada">Muhammed</a> and the <a href="Marinid">Marinid</a> Sultan of <a href="Fes">Fez</a>, <a href="Abu%20al-Hasan%20Ali%20ibn%20Othman">Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman</a>, united to <a href="Third%20Siege%20of%20Gibraltar">besiege Gibraltar</a> with a large army and naval force. This time the king of Castile, <a href="Alfonso%20XI%20of%20Castile">Alfonso XI</a>, was unable to raise a relief force for several months because of the threat of rebellions within his kingdom. The relief force eventually arrived in June 1333 but found that the starving inhabitants of Gibraltar had already surrendered to the Moors of Fez. The Castilians now found themselves having to <a href="Fourth%20Siege%20of%20Gibraltar">besiege an entrenched enemy</a>, but they were unable to break through the Moorish defences and, faced with a stalemate, the two sides agreed to disengage in exchange for mutual concessions and a four-year truce.

Abu al-Hasan refortified Gibraltar with what the Arab chroniclers called "strong walls as a halo surrounds a crescent moon" in anticipation of renewed war, which duly broke out in 1339. However, his forces suffered a disastrous defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20R%C3%ADo%20Salado">Battle of Río Salado</a> in October 1340 and fell back to Algeciras. The Castilians <a href="Siege%20of%20Algeciras%20%281342%E2%80%9344%29">besieged the city for two years</a> and eventually forced its surrender, though Gibraltar remained in Moorish hands. The peninsula's defences had been greatly improved by Abu al-Hasan's construction of new walls, towers, magazines and a citadel, making its capture a much more difficult endeavour. Alfonso XI once again <a href="Fifth%20Siege%20of%20Gibraltar">laid siege in 1349</a> following the death of Abu al-Hasan but was thwarted by the arrival of the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a> in 1350, which killed many of his soldiers and claimed his own life.

Gibraltar remained in Moorish hands until 1462 but was disputed between the Nasrids of Granada and Marinids of Fez. In 1374 the latter handed the peninsula to the former, apparently in payment for Granadan military support in suppressing rebellions in <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>. Gibraltar's garrison rebelled against the Nasrids in 1410 but a Granadan army retook the place the following year after <a href="Sixth%20Siege%20of%20Gibraltar">a brief siege</a>. Gibraltar was subsequently used by the Granadans as the base for raids into Christian territory, prompting <a href="Enrique%20P%C3%A9rez%20de%20Guzm%C3%A1n%2C%202nd%20Count%20de%20Niebla">Enrique de Guzmán, second Count of Niebla</a>, to <a href="Seventh%20Siege%20of%20Gibraltar">lay siege in 1436</a>. The attempt ended in disaster; the attack was repelled with heavy casualties and Enrique himself was drowned while trying to escape by sea. His body was recovered by the Moors, decapitated and hung on the walls of Gibraltar for the next twenty-two years.

Moorish rule over Gibraltar came to an end in August 1462 when a small Castilian force under the command of Alonso de Arcos, the governor of Tarifa, launched <a href="Eighth%20Siege%20of%20Gibraltar">a surprise attack</a>. The Castilians mounted their attack while Gibraltar's senior commanders and townspeople were away paying homage to the new sultan of Granada. After a short assault which inflicted heavy losses on the defenders, the garrison surrendered to Enrique de Guzmán's son <a href="Juan%20Alonso%20de%20Guzm%C3%A1n%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Medina%20Sidonia">Juan Alonso</a>, now the first <a href="Duke%20of%20Medina%20Sidonia">Duke of Medina Sidonia</a>. The Moorish inhabitants were once again expelled "en masse", to be replaced by Christians.

Shortly after Gibraltar's recapture, King <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20Castile">Henry IV of Castile</a> declared it Crown property and reinstituted the special privileges which his predecessor had granted during the previous period of Christian rule. Four years after visiting Gibraltar in 1463, he was overthrown by the Spanish nobility and clergy. His half-brother <a href="Alfonso%2C%20Prince%20of%20Asturias%20%281453%E2%80%931468%29">Alfonso</a> was declared king and rewarded Medina Sidonia for his support with the lordship of Gibraltar. The existing governor, a loyalist of the deposed Henry IV, refused to surrender Gibraltar to Medina Sidonia. After <a href="Ninth%20Siege%20of%20Gibraltar">a fifteen-month siege</a> from April 1466 to July 1467, Medina Sidonia took control of the town. He died the following year but his son Enrique was confirmed as lord of Gibraltar by the reinstated Henry IV in 1469. In 1474 the new Duke of Medina Sidonia sold Gibraltar to a group of Jewish "<a href="converso">converso</a>s" from <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Spain">Cordova</a> and <a href="Seville">Seville</a> led by <a href="Pedro%20de%20Herrera">Pedro de Herrera</a> in exchange for maintaining the garrison of the town for two years, after which time the 4,350 "conversos" were expelled by the Duke. His status was further enhanced by <a href="Isabella%20I%20of%20Castile">Isabella I of Castile</a> in 1478 with the granting of the <a href="Marquisate%20of%20Gibraltar">Marquisate of Gibraltar</a>.

On 2 January 1492, after five years of war, the Moorish emirate in Spain came to an end with the <a href="Catholic%20Monarchs">Catholic Monarchs</a>' capture of Granada. The Jews of Gibraltar were, like those elsewhere in the kingdom, <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Spain%23Edict%20of%20Expulsion">expelled from Spain</a> by order of the monarchs in March that year. Gibraltar was used by Medina Sidonia as a base for the Spanish capture of <a href="Melilla">Melilla</a> in North Africa in 1497. Two years later the Muslims of Granada were ordered to convert to Christianity or leave. Those that did not convert left for North Africa, some of them travelling via Gibraltar.

Gibraltar became Crown property again in 1501 at the order of Isabella and the following year it received a new <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Gibraltar">set of royal arms</a>, which is still used by modern Gibraltar, replacing those of Medina Sidonia. In the Royal Warrant accompanying the arms, Isabella highlighted Gibraltar's importance as "the key between these our kingdoms in the Eastern and Western Seas [the Mediterranean and Atlantic]". The metaphor was represented on the royal arms by a golden key hanging from the front gate of a battlemented fortress. The warrant charged all future Spanish monarchs to "hold and retain the said City for themselves and in their own possession; and that no alienation of it, nor any part of it, nor its jurisdiction ... shall ever be made from the Crown of Castile."

At this point in history, "Gibraltar" meant not just the peninsula but the entire surrounding area including the land on which the towns of <a href="La%20L%C3%ADnea%20de%20la%20Concepci%C3%B3n">La Línea de la Concepción</a>, San Roque, <a href="Los%20Barrios">Los Barrios</a> and Algeciras now stand. To the east, Gibraltar was bounded by the <a href="Guadiaro%20River">Guadiaro River</a>, and its northern boundaries lay in the vicinity of <a href="Castellar%20de%20la%20Frontera">Castellar de la Frontera</a>, <a href="Jimena%20de%20la%20Frontera">Jimena de la Frontera</a>, <a href="Alcal%C3%A1%20de%20los%20Gazules">Alcalá de los Gazules</a>, <a href="Medina-Sidonia">Medina-Sidonia</a> and <a href="Tarifa%2C%20Spain">Tarifa</a>. From the 16th century, the modern meaning of the name came to be adopted – specifically referring only to the town of Gibraltar and the peninsula on which it stands.

Under Spanish Crown rule, the town of Gibraltar fell into severe decline. The end of Muslim rule in Spain and the Christian capture of the southern ports considerably decreased the peninsula's strategic value. It derived some minor economic value from <a href="tuna">tuna</a>-fishing and wine-producing industries but its usefulness as a fortress was now limited. It was effectively reduced to the status of an unremarkable stronghold on a rocky promontory and <a href="Marbella">Marbella</a> replaced it as the principal Spanish port in the region.

Gibraltar's inhospitable terrain made it an unpopular place to live. To boost the population, convicts from the kingdom of Granada were offered the possibility of serving their sentence in the Gibraltar garrison as an alternative to prison. Despite its apparent unattractiveness, <a href="Juan%20Alfonso%20P%C3%A9rez%20de%20Guzm%C3%A1n%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Medina%20Sidonia">Juan Alfonso de Guzmán, third Duke of Medina Sidonia</a>, nonetheless sought to regain control of the town. In September 1506, following Isabella's death, he <a href="Tenth%20Siege%20of%20Gibraltar">laid siege</a> in the expectation that the gates would quickly be opened to his forces. This did not happen, and after a fruitless four-month blockade he gave up the attempt. Gibraltar received the title of "Most Loyal" from the Spanish crown in recognition of its faithfulness.

Despite continuing external threats Gibraltar was neglected by the Spanish crown and its fortifications fell into disrepair. <a href="Barbary%20pirates">Barbary pirates</a> from North Africa took advantage of the weak defences in September 1540 by mounting a major raid in which hundreds of Gibraltar's residents were taken as hostages or slaves. The <a href="Shrine%20of%20Our%20Lady%20of%20Europe">Shrine of Our Lady of Europe</a> was sacked and all its valuables were stolen. Many of the captives were subsequently released when a Spanish fleet commanded by <a href="Bernardino%20de%20Mendoza%20%28Captain%20General%29">Bernardino de Mendoza</a> intercepted the pirate ships near <a href="Battle%20of%20Albor%C3%A1n">Alborán</a> as they were bringing ransomed hostages back to Gibraltar. The Spanish crown belatedly responded to Gibraltar's vulnerability by building the <a href="Charles%20V%20Wall">Charles V Wall</a> to control the southern flank of the Rock and commissioning the Italian engineer <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Calvi">Giovanni Battista Calvi</a> to strengthen other parts of the fortifications.

The seas around Gibraltar continued to be dangerous for decades to come as Barbary pirate raids continued; although a small squadron of Spanish galleys was based at the port to counter pirate raids, it proved to be of limited effectiveness and many inhabitants were abducted and sold into slavery by the pirates. The problem worsened significantly after 1606, when Spain expelled the <a href="Morisco">Morisco</a>s;– Muslims who had converted to Christianity. Many of the expellees were evacuated to North Africa via Gibraltar but ended up joining the pirate fleets, either as Christian slaves or reconverted Muslims, and raided as far afield as <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>.
The threat of the Barbary pirates was soon joined by that of Spain's enemies in northern Europe. On 5 May 1607, during the <a href="Eighty%20Years%27%20War">Eighty Years' War</a>, a <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch</a> fleet under Admiral <a href="Jacob%20van%20Heemskerk">Jacob van Heemskerk</a> ambushed a Spanish fleet at anchor in the Bay of Gibraltar. The Dutch won an overwhelming victory in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gibraltar%20%281607%29">Battle of Gibraltar</a>, losing no ships and very few men while the entire Spanish fleet was destroyed with the loss of 3,000 men. The Spanish and Dutch declared a temporary truce in 1609 (the <a href="Twelve%20Years%27%20Truce">Twelve Years' Truce</a>) and resumed hostilities in 1621, when a joint Dutch and Danish fleet arrived in the Strait to attack Spanish shipping. This time the Spanish succeeded in capturing and sinking a number of the attackers' ships in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gibraltar%20%281621%29">Battle of Gibraltar</a>, driving away the rest.

An English military presence was briefly established at Gibraltar for the first time in 1620. The Spanish granted permission for the English fleet to use Gibraltar's port as a base for operations against the Barbary pirates, who were raiding the British and Irish coasts. Some in England had ambitions to turn the fleet against Spain rather than the Barbary coast. However, <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">James I</a> successfully resisted <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliamentary</a> pressure to declare war on Spain and the fleet returned to England. After <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> ascended the throne in 1625, a second English fleet was sent to the region with instructions to "take or spoil a town" on the Spanish coast. Gibraltar was one of the proposed targets on the basis that it was small, could easily be garrisoned, supplied and defended, and was in a highly strategic location. The English fleet instead attacked <a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cádiz</a> in the belief that its sacking would be more immediately profitable, but <a href="C%C3%A1diz%20Expedition%20%281625%29">the raid</a> turned into a fiasco. The landing force looted the town's wine stores and was evacuated after four days of mass drunkenness without anything useful having been achieved.

The presence of Spain's enemies in the Straits prompted the Spanish king <a href="Philip%20IV%20of%20Spain">Philip IV</a> to order Gibraltar's defences to be strengthened. A new <a href="South%20Mole%2C%20Gibraltar%20Harbour">mole</a> and gun platforms were built, though the latter's usefulness was limited due to a lack of gunners. The town was an unsanitary, crowded place, which probably contributed to the outbreak in 1649 of an epidemic – reportedly <a href="Plague%20%28disease%29">plague</a> but possibly <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid</a> – which killed a quarter of the population. English fleets returned to Gibraltar in 1651–52 and again in 1654–55 as temporary allies of the Spanish against French and Dutch shipping in the Straits.
In 1654, <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> decided to turn on Spain (which had been the first state to recognise the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20England">Commonwealth of England</a>) and seize the island of <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a> to make it a base for English expansion in the Caribbean. To do so, two fleets were fitted out: one set out to America and another to the western Mediterranean with the ostensible objective of fighting the Barbary pirates. The fleet in the Caribbean failed to seize Hispaniola but took over <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> instead in May 1655. The fleet in the Mediterranean sailed off Cádiz trying to intercept the Spanish treasure fleet with no success. With the arrival of the winter, the fleet went back to England. However, Spain did not declare <a href="Anglo-Spanish%20War%20%281654%E2%80%9360%29">war on England</a> until February 1656. Shortly after, a fleet of 49 English warships manned by 10,000 sailors and soldiers sailed through the Straits and reconnoitred Gibraltar. Although they lacked a viable landing force and took no action, Oliver Cromwell expressed interest in its capture: "if possessed and made tenable by us, would it not be both an advantage to our trade, and an annoyance to the Spaniards, and enable us [to] ... ease our own charge?" In 1693, during the <a href="Nine%20Years%27%20War">Nine Years' War</a>, in which Spain and England were allies, the remnants of an English-Dutch escort squadron under the command of Admiral Sir <a href="George%20Rooke">George Rooke</a> took refuge at Gibraltar, pursued by the French, after losing the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lagos%20%281693%29">Battle of Lagos Bay</a>. Eleven years later, Rooke was to return to Gibraltar to capture it.

In November 1700, <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20Spain">Charles II of Spain</a> died childless. The dispute over who should succeed him – the Bourbon Prince <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Spain">Philip of Anjou</a>, grandson of <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV of France</a>, or the Habsburg Archduke <a href="Charles%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles of Austria</a> – soon plunged Europe into a major war. Louis XIV supported Philip. England, the Netherlands, Austria, <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>, Savoy and some of the German states supported Charles, fearing that Philip's accession would result in French domination of Europe and the Americas. In accordance with Charles II's will, Philip was proclaimed king as Philip V of Spain and allied his new kingdom with France. The following February, the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a> broke out when French forces arrived in the Spanish Netherlands and expelled the Dutch from the <a href="barrier%20town">barrier town</a>s. In May 1702, England's <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a> formally declared war on France.

Spain thus became a target for the Anglo-Dutch-Austrian alliance. The confederates' campaign was pursued by land and by sea. The main land offensive was pursued in the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a> by the <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">Duke of Marlborough</a>, while naval forces under the command of Admiral Sir George Rooke harassed French and Spanish shipping in the Atlantic. In 1703, Marlborough devised a plan under which his forces would launch a surprise attack against the French and their <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>n allies in the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> basin while Rooke carried out a diversionary naval offensive in the Mediterranean. Rooke was instructed to attack French or Spanish coastal towns, though the choice of target was left to his discretion.

When Rooke arrived in the region several targets were considered. An attempt to incite the inhabitants of <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> to revolt against Philip V failed, and a plan to assault the French naval base at <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a> was abandoned, and an earlier attempt to take <a href="Battle%20of%20C%C3%A1diz%20%281702%29">Cádiz</a> had failed. Casting around for an easier target, Rooke decided to attack Gibraltar for three principal reasons: it was poorly garrisoned and fortified, it would be of major strategic value to the war effort, and its capture might encourage the inhabitants of southern Spain to reject Philip.

<a href="Capture%20of%20Gibraltar">The attack</a> was launched on 1 August 1704 as a combined operation between the naval force under Rooke's command and a force of Dutch and English marines under the command of <a href="Prince%20George%20of%20Hesse-Darmstadt">Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt</a> and Captain <a href="Edward%20Whitaker">Edward Whitaker</a> of <a href="HMS%20Dorsetshire%20%281694%29">HMS "Dorsetshire"</a>. After a heavy naval bombardment on 2 August, the marines launched a pincer attack on the town, advancing south from the isthmus and north from Europa Point. Gibraltar's defenders were well stocked with food and ammunition but were heavily outnumbered and outgunned. The Spanish position was untenable and on the morning of 4 August, the governor, <a href="Diego%20de%20Salinas">Diego de Salinas</a>, agreed to surrender.

The made it clear that Gibraltar had been taken in the name of Charles III of Spain, described in the terms as "legitimate Lord and King". The inhabitants and garrison of Gibraltar were promised freedom of religion and the maintenance of existing rights if they wished to stay, on condition that they swore an oath of loyalty to Charles as King of Spain. As had happened two years previously in the raid on Cádiz, the discipline of the landing forces soon broke down. There were numerous incidents of rape, all Catholic churches but one (the Parish Church of St. Mary the Crowned, now the <a href="Cathedral%20of%20St.%20Mary%20the%20Crowned">Cathedral</a>) were desecrated or converted into military storehouses, and religious symbols such as the statue of <a href="Our%20Lady%20of%20Europe">Our Lady of Europe</a> were damaged and destroyed. Angry Spanish inhabitants took violent reprisals against the occupiers. English and Dutch soldiers and sailors were attacked and killed, and their bodies were thrown into wells and cesspits.

When the Spanish garrison marched out on 7 August almost all of the inhabitants, some 4,000 people in total, evacuated the town. They refused to swear allegiance to Charles III, instead professing their loyalty to Philip V. They had reason to believe that their exile would not last long, as fortresses and towns changed hands frequently at the time. Many settled nearby in the ruins of Algeciras or around <a href="Santa%20Mar%C3%ADa%20la%20Coronada%20Church">an old hermitage</a> at the head of the bay in the expectation of a prompt return. They took with them the records of the city council including Gibraltar's banner and royal warrant. In time the refugee settlement at the hermitage developed into the town of San Roque. It was regarded by the Spanish, as Philip V put it in 1706, as being the "City of Gibraltar resident in its Campo". A small population of around seventy (mainly neutral <a href="Genoa">Genoese</a> people) stayed behind in Gibraltar.

The Grand Alliance's control of Gibraltar was challenged on 24 August when a French fleet entered the Straits. In the subsequent <a href="Battle%20of%20V%C3%A9lez-M%C3%A1laga">Battle of Vélez-Málaga</a>, both sides sustained heavy crew casualties but lost no ships, enabling each side to claim the engagement as a victory. The French withdrew to Toulon without attempting to assault Gibraltar. In early September a Franco-Spanish army arrived outside Gibraltar and prepared for <a href="Twelfth%20Siege%20of%20Gibraltar">a siege which they commenced on 9 October</a>. Around 7,000 French and Spanish soldiers, aided by refugees from Gibraltar, were pitted against a force of 2,000 defenders consisting of English and Dutch marines and Spanish soldiers and miquelets loyal to Charles.
The defenders were aided from late October by a naval squadron under Admiral Sir <a href="John%20Leake">John Leake</a>. A further 2,200 English and Dutch reinforcements arrived by sea with fresh supplies of food and ammunition in December 1704. With morale falling in the Franco-Spanish camp amid desertions and sickness, Louis XIV despatched <a href="Marshal%20of%20France">Marshal</a> <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20de%20Froulay%20de%20Tess%C3%A9">de Tessé</a> to take command in February 1705. A Franco-Spanish assault was beaten back with heavy casualties and on 31 March, de Tessé gave up the siege, complaining of a "want of method and planning".

During the War of Spanish Succession, Gibraltar was governed by the British commandant as a possession of Duke Charles of Austria as Charles III of Spain. The British commandant, Major General <a href="John%20Shrimpton">John Shrimpton</a>, was appointed by Charles as Gibraltar's governor in 1705 on the advice of Queen Anne. The Queen subsequently declared Gibraltar a <a href="free%20port">free port</a> at the insistence of the Sultan of Morocco, though she had no formal authority to do so. Shrimpton was replaced in 1707 by Colonel <a href="Roger%20Elliott">Roger Elliott</a>, who was replaced in turn by Brigadier <a href="Thomas%20Stanwix">Thomas Stanwix</a> in 1711; this time the appointments were made directly by London with no claim of authority from Charles. Stanwix was ordered to expel all foreign troops from Gibraltar to secure its status as an exclusively British possession but failed to evict the Dutch, apparently not considering them "foreign".

The War of the Spanish Succession was finally settled in 1713 by a series of treaties and agreements. Under the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Utrecht">Treaty of Utrecht</a>, which was signed on 13 July 1713 and brought together a number of sub-treaties and agreements, Philip V was accepted by Britain and Austria as King of Spain in exchange for guarantees that the crowns of France and Spain would not be unified. Various territorial exchanges were agreed: although Philip V retained the Spanish overseas empire, he ceded the <a href="Southern%20Netherlands">Southern Netherlands</a>, <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, Milan, and <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a> to Austria; <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> and some Milanese lands to <a href="Savoy">Savoy</a>; and <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> and <a href="Menorca">Menorca</a> to Great Britain. In addition he granted the British the exclusive right to non-Spanish <a href="history%20of%20slavery">slave trading</a> in Spanish America for thirty years, the so-called "<a href="asiento">asiento</a>". With regard to Gibraltar (), the town, fortifications and port (but not the hinterland) were ceded to Britain "for ever, without any exception or impediment whatsoever." The treaty also stipulated that if Britain was ever to dispose of Gibraltar it would first have to offer the territory to Spain.

Despite its later importance to Britain, Gibraltar was initially seen by the British Government as more of a bargaining counter than a strategic asset. Its defences continued to be neglected, its garrisoning was an unwelcome expense, and Spanish pressure threatened Britain's vital overseas trade. On seven separate occasions between 1713 and 1728 the British Government proposed to exchange Gibraltar for concessions from Spain, but on each occasion the proposals were vetoed by the British Parliament following public protests.

Spain's loss of Gibraltar and other Spanish territories in the Mediterranean was resented by the Spanish public and monarchy alike. In 1717 Spanish forces <a href="Spanish%20conquest%20of%20Sardinia">retook Sardinia</a> and in 1718 <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, both of which had been ceded to Austria under the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Utrecht">Treaty of Utrecht</a>. The effective Spanish repudiation of the treaty prompted the British initially to propose handing back Gibraltar in exchange for a peace agreement and, when that failed, to declare <a href="War%20of%20the%20Quadruple%20Alliance">war on Spain</a>. The Spanish gains were quickly reversed, a Spanish expedition to <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> in 1719 supporting the <a href="Jacobitism">Jacobites</a> <a href="Battle%20of%20Glen%20Shiel">was defeated</a> and peace was eventually restored by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20The%20Hague%20%281720%29">Treaty of The Hague</a>.

In January 1727, Spain declared the nullification of the Treaty of Utrecht's provisions relating to Gibraltar on the grounds that Britain had violated its terms by extending Gibraltar's fortifications beyond the permitted limits, allowing Jews and Moors to live there, failing to protect Catholics and harming Spain's revenues by allowing <a href="smuggling">smuggling</a>. Spanish forces began <a href="Thirteenth%20Siege%20of%20Gibraltar">a siege and bombardment</a> of Gibraltar the following month, causing severe damage through intensive cannon fire. The defenders withstood the threat and were reinforced and resupplied by a British naval force. Bad weather and supply problems caused the Spanish to call off the siege at the end of June.

Britain's hold on Gibraltar was reconfirmed in 1729 by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Seville%20%281729%29">Treaty of Seville</a>, which satisfied neither side; the Spanish had wanted Gibraltar returned, while the British disliked the continuation of the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Utrecht. Spain responded the following year by constructing a line of fortifications across the upper end of the peninsula, cutting off Gibraltar from its hinterland. The fortifications, known to the British as the Spanish Lines, and to Spain as "La Línea de Contravalación" (the Lines of <a href="Investment%20%28military%29">Contravallation</a>), were later to give their name to the modern town of <a href="La%20L%C3%ADnea%20de%20la%20Concepci%C3%B3n">La Línea de la Concepción</a>. Gibraltar was effectively blockaded by land but was able to rely on trade with Morocco for food and other supplies.

Gibraltar's civilian population increased steadily through the century to form a disparate mixture of Britons, Genoese, Jews, Spaniards and Portuguese. By 1754 there were 1,733 civilians in addition to 3,000 garrison soldiers and their 1,426 family members, bringing the total population to 6,159. The civilian population increased to 3,201 by 1777, including 519 Britons, 1,819 Roman Catholics (meaning Spanish, Portuguese, Genoese etc.) and 863 Jews. Each group had its own distinctive niche in the fortress. The Spanish historian <a href="Ignacio%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Ayala">López de Alaya</a>, writing in 1782, characterised their roles thus:

Life for the ordinary soldiers of the garrison was tedious and harsh, with corporal punishment administered for even the most trivial offences. A drummer in the <a href="Lancashire%20Fusiliers">Lancashire Fusiliers</a> became famous for being the most-flogged man in the British Army, receiving 30,000 lashes during his 14 years stationed at Gibraltar. Suicide and desertions were common due to boredom, shortages of food and the poor living conditions. At <a href="Middle%20Hill%20Battery">Middle Hill Battery</a>, guards had to be posted to prevent soldiers from deserting by lowering themselves on ropes down the cliff face. One soldier wrote despairingly in his diary:

The fortifications of Gibraltar were modernised and upgraded in the 1770s with the construction of new batteries, bastions and curtain walls. The driving force behind this programme was the highly experienced Colonel (later Major General) <a href="William%20Green%20%28general%29">William Green</a>, who was to play a key role a few years later as chief engineer of Gibraltar. He was joined in 1776 by Lieutenant General <a href="George%20Augustus%20Eliott%2C%201st%20Baron%20Heathfield">George Augustus Elliott</a>, a veteran of earlier wars against France and Spain who took over the governorship of Gibraltar at a key moment.

Britain's successes in the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a> had left it with expensive commitments in the Americas that had to be paid for and had catalysed the formation of an anti-British coalition in Europe. The British Government's attempt to levy new taxes on the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a> of <a href="British%20America">British America</a> led to the outbreak of the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American War of Independence</a> in 1776. Spain declared war on Britain and <a href="Spain%20in%20the%20American%20Revolutionary%20War">started the Anglo-Spanish War</a> and then tried to recover Gibraltar with French aid.

The <a href="Great%20Siege%20of%20Gibraltar">Great Siege of Gibraltar</a> lasted from 24 June 1779 to 7 February 1783 and remains one of the longest <a href="siege">siege</a>s endured by the <a href="British%20Armed%20Forces">British Armed Forces</a>, as well as being one of the longest continuous sieges in history. A combined Spanish and French fleets <a href="blockade">blockade</a>d Gibraltar from the sea, while on the land side an enormous army was engaged in constructing <a href="fortification">forts</a>, <a href="redoubt">redoubt</a>s, <a href="trench%20warfare">entrenchments</a>, and <a href="artillery%20battery">batteries</a> from which to attack Gibraltar. The Spanish committed increasing number of troops and ships to the siege, postponing the planned invasion of England by the <a href="Armada%20of%201779">Armada of 1779</a>. The first relief of the siege came in the spring of 1780 when <a href="George%20Brydges%20Rodney%2C%201st%20Baron%20Rodney">Admiral George Rodney</a> captured a <a href="Action%20of%208%20January%201780">Spanish convoy off Cape Finesterre</a> and defeated a Spanish fleet at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20St.%20Vincent%20%281780%29">Battle of Cape St. Vincent</a>, delivering reinforcements of 1,052 men and an abundance of supplies.

The British defenders continued to resist every attempt to capture Gibraltar by assault but supplies again began to run low. On 12 April 1781 Vice Admiral <a href="George%20Darby">George Darby</a>'s squadron of 29 ships of the line escorting 100 store ships from England laden for Gibraltar entered the bay. The Spanish fleet was unable to intercept Darby's relief. The Spanish frustrated by this failure began a barrage of the town causing great panic and terror among the civilian population. Deliberate targeting of civilians was unprecedented at the time and was to continue for 2 years obliterating any architectural heritage from the Spanish period. Unable to starve the garrison out the French and Spanish attempted further attacks by land and sea, the night before the Grand Attack on 27 November 1781, the British garrison filed silently out of their defence works and made a surprise <a href="sortie">sortie</a> routing the besieging infantry in their trenches and postponed the grand assault on The Rock for some time.

On 13 September 1782 the <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Bourbon allies</a> launched their great attack; 5190 fighting men, both French and Spanish, aboard ten of the newly engineered '<a href="Floating%20battery">floating batteries</a>' with 138 heavy guns, as well as 18 ships of the line, 40 Spanish gunboats and 20 bomb-vessels with a total of 30,000 sailors and marines. They were supported by 86 land guns and 35,000 Spanish and French troops (7,000–8,000 French) on land intending to assault the fortifications once they had been demolished. The 138 guns opened fire from floating batteries in the Bay and the 86 guns on the land side, directed on the fortifications after weeks of preparatory artillery fire. But the garrison replied with <a href="Heated%20shot">red-hot shot</a> to set fire to and sink the attacker's floating batteries and warships in the Bay. The British destroyed three of the floating batteries, which blew up as the 'red-hot shot' did its job. The other seven batteries were scuttled by the Spanish. In addition 719 men on board the ships (many of whom drowned) were casualties.

In Britain the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> considered plans for a major relief of Gibraltar, opting to send a larger, but slower fleet, rather than a smaller faster one. In September 1782 a large fleet left <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a> under <a href="Richard%20Howe%2C%201st%20Earl%20Howe">Richard Howe</a>, arriving off <a href="Cape%20St.%20Vincent">Cape St. Vincent</a> on 9 October. The following evening a gale blew up, scattering the Spanish and French fleet allowing Howe to sail unopposed into Gibraltar. A total of 34 ships of the line escorted 31 transport ships which delivered supplies, food, and ammunition. The fleet also brought the <a href="King%27s%20Own%20Scottish%20Borderers">25th</a>, <a href="59th%20%282nd%20Nottinghamshire%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">59th</a>, and <a href="97th%20Regiment%20of%20Foot%20%281780%29">97th</a> regiments of foot bringing the total number of the garrison to over 7,000 Howe then sailed out and fought <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Spartel">an indecisive battle</a> with the combined allied fleet before withdrawing to Britain in line with his orders.

The siege was continued for some months longer, but in the spring of 1783 a preliminary peace agreement brought the cessation of hostilities. Finally, in February 1783 the siege was lifted. The outcome of the Great Siege made it politically impossible for the British government to again consider trading away Gibraltar, even though King <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III</a> warned that it would be the source "of another war, or at least of a constant lurking enmity" and expressed his wish "if possible to be rid of Gibraltar ... I shall not think peace complete if we do not get rid of Gibraltar." General Eliott and the garrison were lauded for their heroism, and the tenacity of their defence of Gibraltar acquired, as one writer puts it, "a sort of cult status". The British public acquired "an emotional, albeit irrational, attachment to the place." The reputed impregnability of Gibraltar gave rise to the expression, which is still current today, of something being as "strong as the Rock of Gibraltar".

Following the Great Siege, the civilian population of Gibraltar – which had fallen to under a thousand – expanded rapidly as the territory became both a place of economic opportunity and a refuge from the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. Britain's loss of North American colonies in 1776 led to much of her trade being redirected to new markets in <a href="India">India</a> and the <a href="East%20Indies">East Indies</a>. The favoured route to the east was via <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, even before the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> had been built, and Gibraltar was the first British port reached by ships heading there. The new maritime traffic gave Gibraltar a greatly increased role as a trading port. At the same time, it was a haven in the western Mediterranean from the disruption of the Napoleonic Wars. Many of the new immigrants were Genoese people who had fled Napoleon's annexation of the old <a href="Republic%20of%20Genoa">Republic of Genoa</a>. By 1813 nearly a third of the population consisted of Genoese and Italians. Portuguese made up another 20 per cent, Spaniards 16.5 per cent, Jews 15.5 per cent, British 13 per cent and Menorcans 4 per cent. The young <a href="Benjamin%20Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a> described the inhabitants of Gibraltar as a mixture of "Moors with costumes as radiant as a rainbow or Eastern melodrama, Jews with <a href="gaberdine">gaberdine</a>s and skull-caps, Genoese, Highlanders and Spanish." The inhabitants had a clear pecking order, with British officers at the top and Jews at the bottom. The American naval officer <a href="Alexander%20Slidell%20Mackenzie">Alexander Slidell Mackenzie</a>, writing in 1829, described the market traders and shoppers in what is now <a href="John%20Mackintosh%20Square">John Mackintosh Square</a>:

Gibraltar was an unhealthy place to live due to its poor sanitation and living conditions. It was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a> and <a href="cholera">cholera</a>, which killed thousands of the inhabitants and members of the garrison. An epidemic in the second half of 1804 killed more than a third of the entire population, civilian and military. <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson">Lord Nelson</a> wrote the following March that he hoped that Gibraltar "will escape the dreadful scourge of last autumn, and I hope that <a href="Henry%20Edward%20Fox">General Fox</a> has burnt down all the small houses at the back of the Town; and perhaps if half the Town went with them, it would be better for the Rock."
During the wars against <a href="First%20French%20Empire">Napoleonic France</a>, Gibraltar served first as a <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> base from which blockades of the ports of <a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cádiz</a>, <a href="Cartagena%2C%20Spain">Cartagena</a> and <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a> were mounted, then as a gateway for British forces and supplies in the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a> between 1807 and 1814. In July 1801 a French and Spanish naval force fought the two <a href="Algeciras%20Campaign">Battles of Algeciras</a> off Gibraltar, which ended in disaster for the Spanish when two of their largest warships each mistook the other for the enemy, engaged each other, collided, caught fire and exploded, killing nearly 2,000 Spanish sailors. Two years later Gibraltar served as a base for Lord Nelson in his efforts to bring the French Admiral <a href="Pierre-Charles%20Villeneuve">Pierre-Charles Villeneuve</a> to battle, which culminated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a> in which Nelson was killed and Villeneuve captured. Nelson sailed to Gibraltar in June 1803 to launch the <a href="Trafalgar%20Campaign">Trafalgar Campaign</a> and oversee the blockades against France and Spain, though he spent little time ashore. On 28 October 1805, a week after the Battle of Trafalgar, the badly damaged <a href="HMS%20Victory">HMS "Victory"</a> returned to Gibraltar with Nelson's body aboard; <a href="Cuthbert%20Collingwood%2C%201st%20Baron%20Collingwood">Admiral Collingwood</a>'s dispatch to General Fox, announcing the victory and Nelson's death, was printed in the pages of the "<a href="Gibraltar%20Chronicle">Gibraltar Chronicle</a>". It thus became the first newspaper in the world to report the victory at Trafalgar, two weeks ahead of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>".

In the years after Trafalgar, Gibraltar became a major supply base for supporting the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Spanish uprising against Napoleon</a>. The French invasion of Spain in 1808 prompted Gibraltar's British garrison to cross the border and destroy the ring of Spanish fortresses around the bay, as well as the old Spanish fortified lines on the isthmus, to deny the French the ability to besiege Gibraltar or control the bay from shore batteries. French forces reached as far as San Roque, just north of Gibraltar, but did not attempt to target Gibraltar itself as they believed that it was impregnable. The French <a href="Siege%20of%20Tarifa%20%281812%29">besieged Tarifa</a>, further down the coast, in 1811–12 but gave up after a month. Gibraltar faced no further military threat for a century.

After peace returned, Gibraltar underwent major changes during the reformist governorship of General Sir <a href="George%20Don%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">George Don</a>, who took up his position in 1814. The damage caused by the Great Siege had long since been repaired, but Gibraltar was still essentially a medieval town in its layout and narrow streets. A lack of proper drainage had been a major contributing factor in the epidemics that had frequently ravaged the fortress. Don implemented improved sanitation and drainage as well as introducing street lighting, rebuilding <a href="St%20Bernard%27s%20Hospital">St Bernard's Hospital</a> to serve the civilian population and initiating the construction of the <a href="Cathedral%20of%20the%20Holy%20Trinity%2C%20Gibraltar">Cathedral of the Holy Trinity</a> to serve Gibraltar's Protestant civilians. For the first time, civilians began to have a say in the running of Gibraltar. An Exchange and Commercial Library was founded in 1817, with the Exchange Committee initially focused on furthering the interests of merchants based in the fortress. The Committee evolved into a local civilian voice in government, although it had no real powers. A City Council was established in 1821, and in 1830 Gibraltar became a <a href="Crown%20colony">Crown colony</a>. In the same year, the <a href="Gibraltar%20Police%20Force">Gibraltar Police Force</a> was established, modelled on London's pioneering <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police Service</a>, and <a href="Court%20system%20of%20Gibraltar">a Supreme Court</a> was set up to try civil, criminal and mixed cases.

The economic importance of Gibraltar changed following the invention of <a href="steamboat">steamships</a>; the first one to reach Gibraltar's harbour arrived there in 1823. The advent of steamships caused a major shift in trade patterns in the Mediterranean. Transshipment, which had previously been Gibraltar's principal economic mainstay, was largely replaced by the much less lucrative work of servicing visiting steamships through coaling, victualling and ferrying of goods. Although Gibraltar became a key coaling station where British steamships refuelled on the way to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> or <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a>, the economic changes resulted in a prolonged depression that lasted until near the end of the century. The demand for labour for coaling was such that Gibraltar instituted the practice of relying on large numbers of imported Spanish workers. A shanty town sprang up on the site of the old Spanish fortifications just across the border, which became the workers' town of La Línea de la Concepción. The poor economy meant that Gibraltar's population barely changed between 1830 and 1880, but it was still relatively more prosperous than the severely impoverished south of Spain. As a consequence, La Línea's population doubled over the same period and then doubled again in the following 20 years.

Visiting Gibraltar in the mid-19th century, the English writer <a href="Richard%20Ford%20%28writer%29">Richard Ford</a> wrote in his "<a href="A%20Handbook%20for%20Travellers%20in%20Spain">Handbook for Travellers in Spain</a>" that "the differences of nations and costumes are very curious: a motley masquerade is held in this halfway house between Europe, Asia, and Africa, where every man appears in his own dress and speaks his own language. Civilization and barbarism clash here indeed ... or the Rock, like Algeria, is a refuge for destitute scamps, and is the asylum for people of all nations who expatriate themselves for their country's good." He described the town's Main Street as "the antithesis of a Spanish town", lined with "innumerable pot–houses" which made it a "den of gin and intemperance; every thing and body is in motion; there is no quiet, no repose; all is hurry and scurry, for time is money and Mammon is the god of Gib, as the name is vulgarized ... The entire commerce of the Peninsula seems condensed into this microcosmus, where all creeds and nations meet, and most of them adepts at the one grand game of beggar my neighbour."

Relations with Spain during the 19th century were generally amicable. Regular British soldiers were forbidden to cross the border but officers could cross freely into Spain, as could the inhabitants of Gibraltar, some of whom had second houses in the town of San Roque about away. The garrison introduced the very British activity of <a href="fox%20hunting">fox hunting</a> in the form of the <a href="Royal%20Calpe%20Hunt">Royal Calpe Hunt</a>, started in 1812, which saw British officers and local Spanish gentry pursuing foxes across the Campo de Gibraltar. A major bone of contention during this period was the issue of smuggling across the border. The problem arose after Spain imposed tariffs on foreign manufactured goods in a bid to protect Spain's own fledgling industrial enterprises. Tobacco was also heavily taxed, providing one of the government's principal sources of revenue. The inevitable result was that Gibraltar, where cheap tobacco and goods were readily available, became a centre of intensive smuggling activity. The depressed state of the economy caused smuggling to become a mainstay of Gibraltar's trade; the mid-19th-century Irish traveller Martin Haverty described Gibraltar as "the grand smuggling depot for Spain". General Sir <a href="Robert%20Gardiner%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Robert Gardiner</a>, who served as Governor between 1848 and 1855, described the daily scene in a letter to British Prime Minister <a href="Henry%20John%20Temple%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a>:

The problem was eventually reduced by imposing duties on imported goods, which made them much less attractive to smugglers and raised funds to make much-needed improvements to sanitation. Despite the improvements made earlier in the century, living conditions in Gibraltar were still dire. A Colonel Sayer, who was garrisoned at Gibraltar in the 1860s, described the town as "composed of small and crowded dwellings, ill ventilated, badly drained and crammed with human beings. Upwards of 15,000 persons are confined within a space covering a square mile [2.5 km]." Although there were sewers, a lack of water made them virtually useless in summer and the poorer inhabitants were sometimes unable to afford enough water even to wash themselves. One doctor commented that "the open street is much more desirable than many of the lodgings of the lower orders of Gibraltar." The establishment of a Board of Sanitary Commissioners in 1865 and work on new drainage, sewerage and water supply systems prevented further major epidemics. A system of underground reservoirs capable of containing 5 million gallons (22.7 million litres) of water was constructed within the <a href="Rock%20of%20Gibraltar">Rock of Gibraltar</a>. Other municipal services arrived as well – a gas works in 1857, a telegraph link by 1870 and electricity by 1897. Gibraltar also developed a high-quality school system, with as many as 42 schools by 1860.

By the end of the 19th century, the "Gibraltarians" were given an official identity for the first time. It was only in the 1830s that Gibraltar-born residents began to outnumber foreign-born, but by 1891 nearly 75% of the population of 19,011 people were Gibraltar-born. The emergence of the Gibraltarians as a distinct group owed much to the pressure on housing in the territory and the need to control the numbers of the civilian population, as Gibraltar was still first and foremost a military fortress. Two <a href="Order%20in%20Council">Orders in Council</a> of 1873 and 1885 stipulated that no child of alien parent could be born in Gibraltar, no foreigners could claim a right of residence and that only Gibraltar-born inhabitants were entitled to reside there; everyone else needed permits, unless they were employees of the British Crown. In addition to the 14,244 Gibraltarians, there were also 711 British people, 695 Maltese and 960 from other British dominions. There were 1,869 Spaniards (of whom 1,341 were female) with smaller numbers of Portuguese, Italians, French and Moroccans.

By the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, Gibraltar's future as a British colony was in serious doubt. Its economic value was diminishing, as a new generation of steamships with a much longer range no longer needed to stop there to refuel en route to more distant ports. Its military value was also increasingly in question due to advances in military technology. New long-range guns firing high-explosive shells could easily reach Gibraltar from across the bay or in the Spanish hinterland, while the development of <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es meant that ships at anchor in the bay were also vulnerable. The garrison could hold out for a long time, but if the Spanish coast was held by an enemy, Gibraltar could not be resupplied in the fashion that had saved it in the Great Siege 120 years earlier.

A Spanish proposal to swap Gibraltar for <a href="Ceuta">Ceuta</a> on the other side of the Strait was considered but was eventually rejected. It was ultimately decided that Gibraltar's strategic position as a naval base outweighed its potential vulnerability from the landward side. From 1889, the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> was greatly expanded and both Gibraltar and Malta were equipped with new, torpedo-proof harbours and expanded, modernised dockyards. The works at Gibraltar were carried out by some 2,200 men at the huge cost of £5 million (£ billion in 2013 prices). Under the reforming leadership of <a href="First%20Sea%20Lord">First Sea Lord</a> <a href="John%20Fisher%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fisher">Admiral John "Jacky" Fisher</a>, Gibraltar became the base for the <a href="Atlantic%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Atlantic Fleet</a>. In the British public's imagination, Gibraltar was seen as "a symbol of British naval power [and] a symbol of the empire which has been built and, more than the British lion or even <a href="John%20Bull">John Bull</a> himself, has come to represent Britain's power and prestige across the world."

The value of the naval base was soon apparent when the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> broke out in August 1914. Only a few minutes after the declaration of war went into effect at midnight on 3/4 August, a German liner was captured by a torpedo boat from Gibraltar, followed by three more enemy ships the following day. Although Gibraltar was well away from the main battlefields of the war – Spain remained neutral and the Mediterranean was not contested as it was in the Second World War – it played an important role in the Allied fight against the <a href="U-boat%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">German U-boat campaign</a>. The naval base was heavily used by Allied warships for resupplying and repairs. The Bay of Gibraltar was also used as a forming-up point for Allied convoys, while German U-boats stalked the Strait looking for targets. On two occasions, Gibraltar's guns unsuccessfully fired on two U-boats travelling through the Strait. Anti-submarine warfare was in its infancy and it proved impossible to prevent U-boats operating through the Strait. Only two days before the end of the war, on 9 November 1918, <a href="SM%20UB-50">SM "UB-50"</a> torpedoed and sank the British <a href="battleship">battleship</a> <a href="HMS%20Britannia%20%281904%29">HMS "Britannia"</a> off <a href="Cape%20Trafalgar">Cape Trafalgar</a> to the west of Gibraltar.

The restoration of peace inevitably meant a reduction in military expenditure, but this was more than offset by a large increase in liner and cruise ship traffic to Gibraltar. British liners travelling to and from <a href="India">India</a> and South Africa customarily stopped there, as did French, Italian and Greek liners travelling to and from America. Oil bunkering became a major industry alongside coaling. An airfield was established in 1933 on the isthmus linking Gibraltar to Spain. Civil society was reformed as well; in 1921 an Executive Council and an elected City Council were established to advise the governor, in the first step towards self-government of the territory.

The outbreak of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> in July 1936 presented Gibraltar with major security concerns, as it was initially on the front lines of the conflict. The ultimately successful rebellion led by General <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a> broke out across the Strait in Morocco, and the <a href="Spanish%20Republic%20%281931%E2%80%931939%29">Spanish Republican</a> government sought on several occasions to regain control of the <a href="Nationalist%20faction%20%28Spanish%20Civil%20War%29">Nationalist</a>-controlled area around Algeciras. Although Gibraltar was not directly affected by the fighting, the war caused significant disruption. An undetermined number of Spanish refugees, perhaps as many as 10,000 persons, fled to Gibraltar, resulting in severe overcrowding. A Non-Intervention Patrol was mounted by the Royal Navy, operating from Gibraltar, to prevent foreign military aid reaching the belligerents in Spain. In May 1937, one of the ships involved in the patrol, the destroyer <a href="HMS%20Hunter%20%28H35%29">HMS "Hunter"</a>, hit a Nationalist mine and had to be towed back to Gibraltar with eight of her crew dead. The Spanish Civil War had a deep impact on Gibraltarian society. On one hand, the British authorities, the Anglican and Catholic churches and the Gibraltarian moneyed class supported the Nationalists in the War, while the working class sided with the Republicans. With Europe sliding towards a general war, the British Government decided to strengthen Gibraltar's defences and upgrade the naval base to accommodate the latest generation of battleships and aircraft carriers. A Gibraltar Defence Force (now the <a href="Royal%20Gibraltar%20Regiment">Royal Gibraltar Regiment</a>) was established in March 1939 to assist with home defence.

The outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 did not initially cause much disruption in Gibraltar, as Spain and Italy were neutral at the time. The situation changed drastically after April 1940 when <a href="Battle%20of%20France">Germany invaded France</a>, with <a href="Italian%20invasion%20of%20France">Italy joining the invasion</a> in June 1940. The British Government feared that Spain would also enter the war and it was decided to <a href="evacuation%20of%20the%20Gibraltarian%20civilian%20population%20during%20World%20War%20II">evacuate the entire civilian population of Gibraltar</a> in May 1940. Most went to the United Kingdom and others to <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a> and <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, while some made their own way to <a href="Tangier">Tangier</a> and Spain. An intensive programme of tunnelling and refortification was undertaken; over of tunnels were dug in the Rock, and anti-aircraft batteries were installed in numerous locations in the territory. A new and powerful naval group called <a href="Force%20H">Force H</a> was established at Gibraltar to control the entrance to the Mediterranean and support Allied forces in North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. The airfield, which was now designated <a href="RAF%20North%20Front">RAF North Front</a>, was also extended using soil from the tunnelling works so that it could accommodate bomber aircraft being ferried to North Africa. The garrison was greatly expanded, reaching a peak of 17,000 in 1943 with another 20,000 sailors and airmen accommodated in Gibraltar at the same time.

During the Battle of the Atlantic, Gibraltar played a key role. The <a href="Convoy%23World%20War%20II">Ocean Convoy System</a> adopted by Britain after the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">fall of France</a> in June 1940 ran on two routes – an east–west route between the UK and North America, and a north–south route between the UK, Gibraltar and <a href="Freetown">Freetown</a> in British-ruled <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a>. Even before the war, Gibraltar had been designated as one of the main assembly points for convoys heading inbound to Europe. From late 1942, Gibraltar was the destination of the Central Atlantic convoy route between the United States and the Mediterranean in support of Allied operations in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and elsewhere in the region. A huge number of Allied troops and ships travelled this route; between November 1942 and August 1945, 11,119 ships travelled in 189 convoys between Gibraltar and the United States and vice versa, and between December 1942 and March 1945, 536,134 troops were transported from the United States to Gibraltar.

Gibraltar was directly attacked, both overtly and covertly, on several occasions during the war. <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy French</a> aircraft carried out bombing attacks in 1940 after the surprise attack of their fleet by the royal navy and there were sporadic raids from Italian and German long-range aircraft, though the damage caused was not significant. Franco's position changed subtly from one of neutrality to "non-belligerence", which in practice meant allowing the Axis powers to operate covertly against Gibraltar from Spanish territory. Despite Franco's willingness to overlook German and Italian activities in and around the Bay of Gibraltar, he decided not to join Hitler's planned <a href="Operation%20Felix">Operation Felix</a> to seize the territory. A major factor influencing his decision was the vulnerability of Spain's food supplies, as the country was unable to feed itself after the destruction of the Civil War. It relied on grain imports from the Americas, which would certainly have been cut off had Franco gone to war with the Allies. Hitler eventually abandoned Felix to pursue other priorities such as the <a href="German%20invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasions of Yugoslavia</a> and <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">the Soviet Union</a>.

German and Italian spies kept a constant watch on Gibraltar and sought to carry out sabotage operations, sometimes successfully. The Italians repeatedly carried out raids on Gibraltar's harbour using <a href="human%20torpedo">human torpedo</a>es and divers operating from the Spanish shore, damaging a number of merchant ships and sinking one. Three Spaniards being run as spies and saboteurs by the German <a href="Abwehr">Abwehr</a> were caught in Gibraltar in 1942–43 and <a href="capital%20punishment%20in%20Gibraltar">hanged</a>. The threat to Gibraltar was greatly reduced after the <a href="Armistice%20between%20Italy%20and%20Allied%20armed%20forces">collapse of Italy</a> in September 1943.

Although Gibraltar's civilian inhabitants had started to return as early as April 1944, the last evacuees did not arrive back home until as late as February 1951. The immediate problem after <a href="VJ%20Day">VJ Day</a> was a lack of shipping, as all available vessels were needed to bring troops home, but the longer-term problem was a lack of civilian housing. The garrison was relocated to the southern end of the peninsula to free up space and military accommodation was temporarily reused to house the returning civilians. A programme to build housing projects was implemented, though progress was slow due to shortages of building materials. By 1969, over 2,500 flats had either been built or were under construction.

In the war's aftermath, Gibraltar took decisive steps towards implementing civilian self-governance over most issues of public policy. The <a href="Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Civil%20Rights">Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights</a> (AACR), led by Gibraltarian lawyer <a href="Joshua%20Hassan">Joshua Hassan</a>, won all of the seats in the first post-war City Council elections in 1945. Women were given the right to vote in 1947, and in 1950 a Legislative Council was established. A two-party system had emerged by 1955 with the creation of the <a href="Commonwealth%20Party%20%28Gibraltar%29">Commonwealth Party</a> as a rival to the AACR. That same year Hassan became the first Mayor of Gibraltar. The Governor still retained overall authority and could overrule the Legislative Council. This inevitably caused tension and controversy if the Governor and Legislative Council disagreed, but in 1964 the British Government agreed to confine the powers of the Governor to matters of defence, security and foreign relations. A new constitution was decided on in 1968 and promulgated in 1969, merging the City Council and Legislative Council into a single House of Assembly (known as the <a href="Gibraltar%20Parliament">Gibraltar Parliament</a> since 2006) with 15 elected members, two non-elected officials and a speaker. The old title of "Colony of Gibraltar" was dropped and the territory was renamed as the City of Gibraltar.

Gibraltar's post-war relationship with Spain was marred by an intensification of the long-running dispute over the territory's sovereignty. Although Spain had not attempted to use military force to regain Gibraltar since 1783, the question of sovereignty was still present. Disputes over smuggling and the sea frontier between Gibraltar and Spain had repeatedly caused diplomatic tensions during the 19th century. The neutral zone between Spain and Gibraltar had also been a cause of disputes during the 19th and 20th centuries. This originally had been an undemarcated strip of sand on the isthmus between the British and Spanish lines of fortifications, about wide – the distance of a cannon shot in 1704. Over the years, however, Britain took control of most of the neutral zone, much of which is now occupied by Gibraltar's airport. This expansion provoked repeated protests from Spain.
Spain's push to regain sovereignty over Gibraltar was fuelled by the <a href="decolonization">decolonisation</a> agenda of the United Nations, which had been initiated in 1946. In that year, Britain had listed Gibraltar among other "Overseas Dependent Territories" in conjunction with the drive towards decolonisation, but it was not appreciated at the time that Gibraltar was in a unique position; due to the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, it could only be British or Spanish and could not gain independence. Franco's government calculated that Britain would be willing to give up an expensive possession that no longer had a great deal of military value, but this turned out to be a fundamental misjudgement. The British government followed a policy of allowing its colonies to become self-governing entities before giving them the option of independence. Almost all took it, choosing to become independent republics. That option was not available to Gibraltar under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, which required that if Britain ever relinquished control it was to be handed back to Spain. The Gibraltarians strongly opposed this and organised <a href="Gibraltar%20sovereignty%20referendum%2C%201967">a referendum in September 1967</a> in which 12,138 voters opted to remain with Britain and only 44 supported union with Spain. Spain dismissed the outcome of the referendum, calling the city's inhabitants "pseudo-Gibraltarians" and stating that the "real" Gibraltarians were the descendants of the Spanish inhabitants who had resettled elsewhere in the region over 250 years earlier.

The dispute initially took the form of symbolic protests and a campaign by Spanish diplomats and the state-controlled media. From 1954, Spain imposed increasingly stringent restrictions on trade and the movements of vehicles and people across the border with Gibraltar. Further restrictions were imposed in 1964, and in 1966 the frontier was closed to vehicles. The following year, Spain closed its airspace to aircraft taking off or landing at <a href="Gibraltar%20International%20Airport">Gibraltar International Airport</a>. In 1969, after the passing of the <a href="Gibraltar%20Constitution%20Order%201969">Gibraltar Constitution Order</a>, to which Spain strongly objected, the frontier was closed completely and Gibraltar's telecommunications links through Spain were cut.

The Spanish decision had major consequences not only for the political relationship between Spain and the United Kingdom, but
for the people of Gibraltar, many of whom had relatives or homes in Spain. As one of the Gibraltarians who suffered the closure of the frontier explains:

Franco's death in 1975 led to the beginnings of diplomatic movement between Britain and Spain on the Gibraltar issue, though not immediately. Spain applied to join the <a href="European%20Economic%20Community">European Economic Community</a> (EEC) and <a href="NATO">NATO</a>, for which it needed British support. In 1980, talks between British and Spanish ministers led to the <a href="Lisbon%20Agreement%2C%201980">Lisbon Agreement</a>, a statement on co-operation between the two countries which committed them to starting negotiations on Gibraltar's future and lifting the Spanish restrictions on communications with Gibraltar. Although Britain promised to "honour the freely and democratically expressed wishes of the people of Gibraltar", Prime Minister <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> indicated in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> that sovereignty would be on the table, in a change from the previous policy. However, the border was not reopened due to "technical issues" – code for unresolved issues between the two governments – and the agreement was strongly opposed by many Gibraltarians, who did not wish their sovereignty to be under discussion and objected to the lack of Gibraltarian representatives at the talks. The outbreak of the <a href="Falklands%20War">Falklands War</a> in 1982 caused a further delay. <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> carried out <a href="Operation%20Algeciras">an unsuccessful sabotage operation</a>, kept secret at the time, that was intended to sink a Royal Navy frigate in Gibraltar's harbour; the saboteurs were captured by the Spanish police in Algeciras before they could carry out their attack. A further agreement was reached in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> in 1984 which clarified the Lisbon Agreement and required that Britain allow Spaniards to live and work in Gibraltar, which they would have the right to do anyway as EEC citizens. The border was finally fully reopened on 4–5 February 1985.

After the border reopened, the British government reduced the military presence in Gibraltar by closing the naval dockyard. The RAF presence was also downgraded; although the airport officially remains an RAF base, military aircraft are no longer permanently stationed there. The British garrison, which had been present since 1704, was withdrawn in 1990 following defence cutbacks at the end of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. A number of military units continue to be stationed in Gibraltar under the auspices of <a href="British%20Forces%20Gibraltar">British Forces Gibraltar</a>; the garrison was replaced with locally recruited units of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, while a Royal Navy presence is continued through the <a href="Gibraltar%20Squadron">Gibraltar Squadron</a>, responsible for overseeing the security of Gibraltar's territorial waters. In March 1988 <a href="Operation%20Flavius">a British military operation</a> against members of the <a href="Provisional%20IRA">Provisional IRA</a> (PIRA) planning a car bomb attack in Gibraltar ended in controversy when the <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a> shot and killed all three PIRA members.

The military cutbacks inevitably had major implications for Gibraltar's economy, which had up to that point depended largely on defence expenditure. It prompted the territory's government to shift its economic orientation and place a much greater emphasis on encouraging tourism and establishing self-sufficiency. <a href="Tourism%20in%20Gibraltar">Tourism in Gibraltar</a> was encouraged through refurbishing and pedestrianising key areas of the city, building a new passenger terminal to welcome cruise ship visitors and opening new marinas and leisure facilities. By 2011, Gibraltar was attracting over 10 million visitors a year compared to a population of 29,752, giving it one of the highest <a href="World%20Tourism%20rankings">tourist-to-resident ratios</a> in the world.

The government also encouraged the development of new industries such as financial services, <a href="duty-free%20shop">duty-free shop</a>ping, <a href="casino">casino</a>s and Internet gambling. Branches of major British chains such as <a href="Marks%20%26amp%3B%20Spencer">Marks & Spencer</a> were opened in Gibraltar to encourage visits from British expatriates on the nearby <a href="Costa%20del%20Sol">Costa del Sol</a>. To facilitate the territory's economic expansion, a major programme of land reclamation was carried out; a tenth of Gibraltar's present-day land area was reclaimed from the sea. These initiatives proved enormously successful. By 2007, Chief Minister <a href="Peter%20Caruana">Peter Caruana</a> was able to boast that Gibraltar's economic success had made it "one of the most affluent communities in the entire world." , Gibraltar is ranked as the second most prosperous territory within the European Union and the 18th most prosperous worldwide in terms of gross domestic product by <a href="purchasing%20power%20parity">purchasing power parity</a> per capita (the United Kingdom, for comparison, is 33rd worldwide and Spain is 44th). Today, Gibraltar has one <a href="Big%20Four%20%28audit%20firms%29">Big Four</a> accounting firm office per 10,000 people, the second highest in the world after the <a href="British%20Virgin%20Islands">British Virgin Islands</a>, and a bank per 1,700 people, the fifth most banks per capita in the world.

Gibraltar's relationship with Spain continued to be a sensitive subject. By 2002, Britain and Spain had proposed an agreement to share sovereignty over Gibraltar. However, it was opposed by the government of Gibraltar, which put it to <a href="Gibraltar%20sovereignty%20referendum%2C%202002">a referendum in November 2002</a>. The agreement was rejected by 17,000 votes to 187 – a majority of 98.97%. Although both governments dismissed the outcome as having no legal weight, the outcome of the referendum caused the talks to stall and the British government accepted that it would be unrealistic to try to reach an agreement without the support of the people of Gibraltar.

The tercentenary of the capture of Gibraltar was celebrated in the territory in August 2004 but attracted criticism from some in Spain. In September 2006, tripartite talks between Spain, Gibraltar and the UK resulted in a deal (known as the <a href="Cordoba%20Agreement%2C%202006">Cordoba Agreement</a>) to make it easier to cross the border and to improve transport and communications links between Spain and Gibraltar. Among the changes was an agreement to lift restrictions on Gibraltar's airport to enable airlines operating from Spain to land there and to facilitate use of the airport by Spanish residents. It did not address the vexed issue of sovereignty, but this time the government of Gibraltar supported it. A <a href="Gibraltar%20Constitution%20Order%202006">new Constitution Order</a> was promulgated in the same year, which was approved by a majority of 60.24% in a referendum held in November 2006.

Persoonia levis

Persoonia levis, commonly known as the broad-leaved geebung, is a <a href="shrub">shrub</a> native to <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> in eastern Australia. It reaches 5 m (16 ft) in height and has dark grey papery bark and bright green asymmetrical sickle-shaped leaves up to 14 cm (5.5 in) long and 8 cm (3.2 in) wide. The small yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April), followed by small green fleshy fruit, which are classified as <a href="drupe">drupe</a>s. Within the genus "<a href="Persoonia">Persoonia</a>", it is a member of the "Lanceolata" group of 58 closely related species. "P. levis" interbreeds with several other species where they grow together.

Found in dry <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest on <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>-based nutrient-deficient soils, "P. levis" is adapted to a fire-prone environment; the plants resprout <a href="Epicormic%20shoot">epicormic buds</a> from beneath their thick bark after <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a>s, and can live for over 60 years. Regeneration also takes place after fire by a <a href="Soil%20seed%20bank">ground-stored seed bank</a>. The longtongue bee "<a href="Leioproctus%20carinatifrons">Leioproctus carinatifrons</a>" is a <a href="pollinator">pollinator</a> of the flowers, and the fruit are consumed by vertebrates such as <a href="kangaroo">kangaroo</a>s, <a href="Phalangeriformes">possums</a> and <a href="currawong">currawong</a>s. Despite its horticultural appeal, "P. levis" is rare in <a href="horticulture">cultivation</a> as it is very hard to <a href="Plant%20propagation">propagate</a>, either by seed or <a href="cutting%20%28plant%29">cuttings</a>.

"Persoonia levis" grows as a tall shrub to small tree, and can reach 5 m (16 ft) in height. The flaky soft <a href="Bark%20%28botany%29">bark</a> is dark grey on the surface, while deeper layers are reddish in colour. Within the bark are <a href="Epicormic%20shoot">epicormic buds</a>, which sprout new growth after bushfire. The new growth is smooth to slightly hairy. The large green leaves measure 6 to 14 cm (2.2–5.5 in) in length, and 1.3 to 8 cm (0.5–3.2 in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate). The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from "P. lanceolata". The bright green foliage, particularly of new growth, stands out against the more subdued tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April), and peak over December to February. They are arranged on short axillary <a href="raceme">raceme</a>s along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical <a href="perianth">perianth</a>, consisting of <a href="tepal">tepal</a>s fused for most of their length, within which are both male and female parts. The central <a href="Gynoecium%23The%20stigma%20and%20style">style</a> is surrounded by the <a href="anther">anther</a>, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the <a href="Stigma%20%28botany%29">stigma</a>, which is located at the tip of the style. The smooth fleshy fruit, known as a <a href="drupe">drupe</a>, is green and more or less round, measuring 1 cm (0.4 in) by 0.8 cm (0.3 in) in diameter. It contains two seeds, and has a spike at the end. The drupe is juicy but stringy when unripe, and the seeds and skin are inedible.

"Persoonia levis" was described and given the name "Linkia levis" by <a href="Antonio%20Jos%C3%A9%20Cavanilles">Antonio José Cavanilles</a> in 1798. His description was based on plant material collected by <a href="Luis%20N%C3%A9e">Luis Née</a> in the vicinity of <a href="Port%20Jackson">Port Jackson</a> (Sydney) in April 1793 during the <a href="Malaspina%20Expedition">Malaspina Expedition</a>. The species was placed in the genus "<a href="Persoonia">Persoonia</a>" by <a href="Karel%20Domin">Karel Domin</a> in 1921. The genus names "Linkia" and "Persoonia" had been coined in 1798, but the latter was officially <a href="nomen%20conservandum">conserved</a>. The <a href="Botanical%20name">species name</a> is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> adjective "", meaning "smooth", and refers to the hairless foliage. <a href="Christiaan%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christiaan Hendrik Persoon</a> coined the name "Persoonia salicina" for it in his 1805 work "Synopsis Plantarum", and queried whether Cavanilles' "Linkia levis" was in fact "<a href="Persoonia%20lanceolata">P. lanceolata</a>". <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> used Persoon's name in his 1810 work "<a href="Prodromus%20Florae%20Novae%20Hollandiae%20et%20Insulae%20Van%20Diemen">Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen</a>", and echoed Persoon's thoughts on Cavanilles' original name and specimen. In the 1995 "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" revision of the genus, Peter John Weston reviewed the mounted material of "Linkia levis", and found that Cavanilles had mounted material from both "P. levis" and "P. lanceolata". He set one specimen of the three, which was clearly "P. levis", as the <a href="lectotype">lectotype</a>, which aligned the material with the <a href="Species%20description">description</a>. Common names include broad-leaved geebung, willow geebung and smooth geebung. The term geebung is derived from the <a href="Sydney%20language">Dharug</a> language word "geebung".

Like most other members of the genus, "Persoonia levis" has seven <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s that are large compared to those of other Proteaceae. In 1870, <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> published the first <a href="wikt%3Ainfrageneric">infrageneric</a> arrangement of "Persoonia" in Volume 5 of his landmark "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>". He divided the genus into three <a href="taxonomic%20section">section</a>s, placing "P. levis" (which he called "P. salicina") in "P." sect. "Amblyanthera". The 1995 "Flora of Australia" revision of the genus saw it classified in the "Lanceolata" group, a group of 58 closely related species with similar flowers but very different foliage. These species will often interbreed with each other where two members of the group occur, and <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrids</a> with "<a href="Persoonia%20acerosa">P. acerosa</a>", "P. lanceolata", "<a href="Persoonia%20linearis">P. linearis</a>", "<a href="Persoonia%20mollis">P. mollis</a>" subsp. "ledifolia", "<a href="Persoonia%20myrtilloides">P. myrtilloides</a>" subsp. "myrtilloides" (in the Upper <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Blue Mountains</a>, these plants resemble "P. lanceolata"), "<a href="Persoonia%20oxycoccoides">P. oxycoccoides</a>", and "<a href="Persoonia%20stradbrokensis">P. stradbrokensis</a>" have been recorded. Robert Brown initially described the hybrid with "P. linearis" as a species ""Persoonia lucida"", which is now known as "Persoonia × lucida", and has been recorded from the southeast forests of the New South Wales south coast.

"Persoonia levis" is found from the <a href="Macleay%20River">Macleay River</a> catchment on the New South Wales <a href="Mid%20North%20Coast">mid north coast</a> to the <a href="Cann%20River">Cann River</a> in far eastern <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>. It is found in dry sclerophyll forest on <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>-based nutrient-deficient soils, from sea level to an altitude of 1000 m (3500 ft). There it grows in sunny or lightly shaded areas in open woodland, associated with such trees as "<a href="Eucalyptus%20piperita">Eucalyptus piperita</a>", "<a href="Eucalyptus%20sieberi">E. sieberi</a>", "<a href="Eucalyptus%20sclerophylla">E. sclerophylla</a>", "<a href="Eucalyptus%20radiata">E. radiata</a>", "<a href="Eucalyptus%20smithii">E. smithii</a>", "<a href="Angophora%20costata">Angophora costata</a>" and "<a href="Corymbia%20gummifera">Corymbia gummifera</a>", and shrubs such as "<a href="Conospermum%20longifolium">Conospermum longifolium</a>", "<a href="Grevillea%20buxifolia">Grevillea buxifolia</a>", "<a href="Grevillea%20phylicoides">G. phylicoides</a>", "<a href="Hakea%20laevipes">Hakea laevipes</a>", "<a href="Symphionema%20montanum">Symphionema montanum</a>" and "<a href="Telopea%20speciosissima">Telopea speciosissima</a>", as well as "<a href="Persoonia%20hirsuta">Persoonia hirsuta</a>" and "P. mollis". Coastal forms are smaller with broader leaves than inland forms. The annual rainfall of the area it occurs in the <a href="Sydney%20Basin">Sydney Basin</a> is . It is considered adequately protected in the Sydney region, and is found in <a href="Georges%20River%20National%20Park">Georges River</a>, <a href="Cattai%20National%20Park">Cattai</a>, <a href="Wollemi%20National%20Park">Wollemi</a>, <a href="Bouddi%20National%20Park">Bouddi</a>, <a href="Brisbane%20Water%20National%20Park">Brisbane Water</a>, <a href="Marramarra%20National%20Park">Marramarra</a>, <a href="Ku-ring-gai%20Chase%20National%20Park">Ku-ring-gai Chase</a>, <a href="Garigal%20National%20Park">Garigal</a>, <a href="Lane%20Cove%20National%20Park">Lane Cove</a>, <a href="Sydney%20Harbour%20National%20Park">Sydney Harbour</a>, <a href="Botany%20Bay%20National%20Park">Botany Bay</a> and <a href="Budderoo%20National%20Park">Budderoo National Park</a>s.

"Persoonia levis" is one of several species of "Persoonia" that regenerate by resprouting from the trunk after <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a>, an adaptation to the <a href="Fire%20ecology">fire-prone</a> habitat in which it grows. Its thick papery bark shields the underlying <a href="Epicormic%20shoot">epicormic buds</a> from the flames. Plants also regenerate by seedlings that arise from a seedbank in the soil after fire, although they may take up to 12 months to germinate. One study of <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest unburnt for thirty years showed "P. levis" had declined over time. "P. levis" plants can live for over 60 years, and their leaves have a lifespan of up to 6 years.

Vesicles indicating a <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l association have been found on the roots of "Persoonia levis", the Proteaceae not previously noted for forming mycorrhizal associations. Infection by the fungal species "<a href="Anthracostroma%20persooniae">Anthracostroma persooniae</a>" results in leaf spot disease. "P. levis" is the food plant of the larvae of the <a href="weevil">weevil</a> species "<a href="Eurhynchus%20laevior">Eurhynchus laevior</a>".

<a href="Colletidae">Colletid</a> bees of the genus "<a href="Leioproctus">Leioproctus</a>" subgenus "<a href="Cladocerapis">Cladocerapis</a>" exclusively forage on and pollinate flowers of many species of "Persoonia". Bees of subgenus "<a href="Filiglossa">Filiglossa</a>" in the same genus that also specialise in feeding on "Persoonia" flowers do not appear to be effective pollinators. Particular species recorded on "P. levis" include the longtongue bee "<a href="Leioproctus%20carinatifrons">Leioproctus carinatifrons</a>". Weighing 1700 mg (0.60 oz), the fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates, such as <a href="kangaroo">kangaroo</a>s and <a href="Phalangeriformes">possums</a>, as well as <a href="currawong">currawong</a>s and other large birds. The flowers of "P. levis" are <a href="Self-incompatibility%20in%20plants">self-incompatible</a>—that is, they are unable to <a href="Fertilisation%23Fertilisation%20in%20plants">fertilise</a> themselves and require <a href="outcrossing">outcrossing</a> to another plant.

"Persoonia levis" is rarely seen in <a href="horticulture">cultivation</a>, mainly because of difficulties in <a href="Plant%20propagation">propagation</a>; seed <a href="germination">germination</a> is unpredictable, and <a href="cutting%20%28plant%29">cuttings</a> have been nearly impossible to strike. Nevertheless, its colourful bark and leaves are attractive horticultural features. Well-drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for the plant in a garden situation. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells and grows fairly readily, albeit slowly, in suitable conditions. <a href="Plantsman">Plantsmen</a> in England germinated seed as early as 1795.

Persoonia linearis

Persoonia linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geebung, is a <a href="shrub">shrub</a> native to <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> in eastern Australia. It reaches , or occasionally , in height and has thick, dark grey papery bark. The leaves are, as the species name suggests, more or less linear in shape, and are up to long, and wide. The small yellow flowers appear in summer, autumn and early winter (December to July), followed by small green fleshy fruit known as <a href="drupe">drupe</a>s. Within the genus "<a href="Persoonia">Persoonia</a>", it is a member of the "Lanceolata" group of 58 closely related species. "P. linearis" interbreeds with several other species where they grow together.

Found in dry <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest on <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>-based nutrient-deficient soils, "P. linearis" is adapted to a fire-prone environment; the plants resprout <a href="Epicormic%20shoot">epicormic buds</a> from beneath their thick bark after <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a>s. The fruit are consumed by vertebrates such as <a href="kangaroo">kangaroo</a>, <a href="Phalangeriformes">possums</a> and <a href="currawong">currawong</a>s. As with other members of the genus, "P. linearis" is rare in <a href="horticulture">cultivation</a> as it is very hard to <a href="Plant%20propagation">propagate</a>, either by seed or <a href="cutting%20%28plant%29">cuttings</a>. It adapts readily to cultivation, preferring <a href="Soil%20pH">acidic soils</a> with good drainage and at least a partly sunny aspect.

English botanist and artist <a href="Henry%20Charles%20Andrews">Henry Charles Andrews</a> <a href="Species%20description">described</a> "Persoonia linearis" in 1799, in the second volume of his "Botanists Repository, Comprising Colour'd Engravings of New and Rare Plants". He had been given a plant in flower by J. Robertson of <a href="Stockwell">Stockwell</a>, who had grown it from seed in 1794. The species name is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "linearis" "linear", referring to the shape of the leaves.

Meanwhile, German botanist <a href="Karl%20Friedrich%20von%20Gaertner">Karl Friedrich von Gaertner</a> had coined the name "Pentadactylon angustifolium" in 1807 from a specimen in the collection of <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Joseph Banks</a> to describe what turned out to be the same species. The genus name derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> "penta-" "five" and "dactyl" "fingers", and refers to the five-lobed <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s. The horticulturist <a href="Joseph%20Knight%20%28horticulturist%29">Joseph Knight</a> described this species as the narrow-leaved persoonia ("Persoonia angustifolia") in his controversial 1809 work "<a href="On%20the%20cultivation%20of%20the%20plants%20belonging%20to%20the%20natural%20order%20of%20Proteeae">On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae</a>", but the binomial name is <a href="illegitimate%20name">illegitimate</a> as it postdated Andrews' description and name. <a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a> described a population from the <a href="Tambo%20River%20%28Victoria%29">Tambo River</a> in Victoria as a separate variety, "Persoonia linearis" var. "latior" in 1856, but no varieties or subspecies are recognised. German botanist <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> proposed the binomial name "Linkia linearis" in 1891, from <a href="Antonio%20Jos%C3%A9%20Cavanilles">Cavanilles</a>' original description of the genus "Linkia" but the name was eventually rejected in favour of "Persoonia". In 1919, French botanist <a href="Michel%20Gandoger">Michel Gandoger</a> described three species all since reallocated to "P. linearis"; "P. phyllostachys" from material collected at <a href="Mount%20Wilson%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Mount Wilson</a> sent to him by the herbarium at the <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Sydney">Royal Botanic Gardens</a> in Sydney, and "P. walteri" and "P. breviuscula" from Melbourne-based plant collector Charles Walter, whose records have been questioned. The short-leaved material of "P. breviuscula" was noted to have been collected in Queensland but this is now thought to have been incorrectly recorded. Gandoger described 212 taxa of Australian plants, almost all of which turned out to be species already described.

In 1870, <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> published the first <a href="wikt%3Ainfrageneric">infrageneric</a> arrangement of "<a href="Persoonia">Persoonia</a>" in Volume 5 of his landmark "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>". He divided the genus into three <a href="taxonomic%20section">section</a>s, placing "P. linearis" in "P." sect. "Amblyanthera", and recognising "Pentadactylon angustifolium" as the same species, after examining the specimen in the Banksian Herbarium. He described a <a href="Variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> "sericea" from the <a href="Shoalhaven%20River">Shoalhaven River</a> region and also noted the discrepancy in <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a>'s description of the species. Brown had noted the bark to be smooth, in contrast to <a href="Ferdinand%20von%20Mueller">Ferdinand von Mueller</a> and others who recorded the bark as layered.

The genus was reviewed by Peter Weston for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" treatment in 1995, and "P. linearis" was placed in the "Lanceolata" group, a group of 54 closely related species with similar flowers but very different foliage. These species will often interbreed with each other where two members of the group occur, and <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrids</a> with "<a href="Persoonia%20chamaepeuce">P. chamaepeuce</a>", "<a href="Persoonia%20conjuncta">P. conjuncta</a>", "<a href="Persoonia%20curvifolia">P. curvifolia</a>", "<a href="Persoonia%20lanceolata">P. lanceolata</a>", "<a href="Persoonia%20media">P. media</a>", five subspecies of "<a href="Persoonia%20mollis">P. mollis</a>", "<a href="Persoonia%20myrtilloides">P. myrtilloides</a>" subsp. "cunninghamii", "<a href="Persoonia%20oleoides">P. oleoides</a>", "<a href="Persoonia%20pinifolia">P. pinifolia</a>" and "<a href="Persoonia%20sericea">P. sericea</a>" have been recorded. Robert Brown initially described the hybrid with "<a href="Persoonia%20levis">P. levis</a>" as a species ""Persoonia lucida"", which is now known as "Persoonia × lucida", and has been recorded from the southeast forests of the New South Wales south coast.

Bentham wrote in 1870 that the name "geebung", derived from the <a href="Sydney%20language">Dharug</a> language word "geebung" or "jibbong", which had been used by the indigenous people for the fruits of this species. It goes by the common names of narrow-leaved geebung or narrow-leaf geebung. "Naam-burra" is an <a href="Aboriginal%20Australians">aboriginal</a> name from the <a href="Illawarra">Illawarra</a> region.

"Persoonia linearis" grows as a tall shrub to small tree, occasionally reaching in height but more commonly around tall. The flaky soft bark is dark grey on the surface, while deeper layers are reddish. Within the bark are epicormic buds, which sprout new growth after bushfire. The new growth is hairy. The leaves are more or less linear in shape, measuring in length and wide, with slightly down-rolled <a href="Leaf%23Edge%20.28margin.29">margins</a>.

The yellow flowers appear in summer, autumn and early winter (December to July), peaking over January and February. They are arranged in leafy <a href="raceme">raceme</a>s, and each stem may bear up to 50 flowers. "P. linearis" is described as auxotelic, which means each stalk bears an individual flower that is subtended by a leaf at its junction with the stem. Known as <a href="Pedicel%20%28botany%29">pedicels</a>, these are covered in fine hair and measure 2–8 mm in length. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical <a href="perianth">perianth</a>, consisting of <a href="tepal">tepal</a>s fused for most of their length, within which are both male and female parts. The tepals are long and covered in fine hair on the outside. The central <a href="Gynoecium%23The%20stigma%20and%20style">style</a> is surrounded by the <a href="anther">anther</a>, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects visiting the <a href="Stigma%20%28botany%29">stigma</a>, which is located at the tip of the style. The flowers are followed by the development of smooth fleshy <a href="drupe">drupe</a>s, which are green and more or less round, measuring in diameter. Mature drupes may have purple blotches. Each bears one or two seeds within a woody "stone" and is shed once ripe, generally from September to November.

One of the most common geebungs, "Persoonia linearis" is found from the <a href="Macleay%20River">Macleay River</a> catchment on the New South Wales <a href="Mid%20North%20Coast">Mid North Coast</a> to the Tambo River in eastern Victoria. It is found from sea level to altitudes of with an average yearly rainfall of . It is a component of dry <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest on both sandstone and clay soils. It grows in sunny to lightly shaded areas in open forest or woodland with a shrubby <a href="understory">understory</a>. In the <a href="Sydney%20Basin">Sydney Basin</a>, it is associated with such trees as Sydney peppermint ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20piperita">Eucalyptus piperita</a>"), silvertop ash ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20sieberi">E. sieberi</a>"), blue-leaved stringybark ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20agglomerata">E. agglomerata</a>"), blackbutt ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20pilularis">E. pilularis</a>"), grey ironbark ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20paniculata">E. paniculata</a>"), snappy gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20rossii">E. rossii</a>"), Sydney blue gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20saligna">E. saligna</a>"), narrow-leaved stringybark ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20sparsifolia">E. sparsifolia</a>") and smooth-barked apple ("<a href="Angophora%20costata">Angophora costata</a>") and shrubs such as "<a href="Grevillea%20obtusiflora">Grevillea obtusiflora</a>", "<a href="Grevillea%20phylicoides">G. phylicoides</a>", Kowmung hakea ("<a href="Hakea%20dohertyi">Hakea dohertyi</a>"), long leaf smoke bush ("<a href="Conospermum%20longifolium">Conospermum longifolium</a>") and stiff geebung ("<a href="Persoonia%20rigida">Persoonia rigida</a>"). In the vicinity of <a href="Nowra%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Nowra</a> and <a href="Jervis%20Bay">Jervis Bay</a>, it is an understory component of the widespread Currambene Lowlands Forest community, alongside such plants as gorse bitter pea ("<a href="Daviesia%20ulicifolia">Daviesia ulicifolia</a>"), bearded heath ("<a href="Leucopogon%20juniperinus">Leucopogon juniperinus</a>") and native daphne ("<a href="Pittosporum%20undulatum">Pittosporum undulatum</a>") with spotted gum ("<a href="Corymbia%20maculata">Corymbia maculata</a>"), white stringybark ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20globoidea">Eucalyptus globoidea</a>") and woollybutt ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20longifolia">E. longifolia</a>") as the dominant trees. The tall dry sclerophyll forest is on hilly terrain with good drainage. The underlying soil is a yellow loam originating from <a href="mudstone">mudstone</a>, <a href="siltstone">siltstone</a> and sandstone.

"Persoonia linearis" is one of several species of "Persoonia" that regenerate by <a href="Resprouter">resprouting</a> from trunks or stems greater than thick after <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a>, an adaptation to the <a href="Fire%20ecology">fire-prone</a> habitat where it grows. However, only larger trunks of diameter might survive to reshoot after very hot fires. The thick papery bark shields and insulates the underlying <a href="Epicormic%20shoot">epicormic buds</a> from the flames. The plant can reshoot from the base, but generally only if the stem or trunk is killed.

<a href="Colletidae">Colletid</a> bees of the genus "<a href="Leioproctus">Leioproctus</a>", subgenus "<a href="Cladocerapis">Cladocerapis</a>" exclusively forage on and pollinate flowers of many species of "Persoonia". Bees of subgenus "<a href="Filiglossa">Filiglossa</a>" in the same genus, which also specialise in feeding on "Persoonia" flowers, do not appear to be effective pollinators. Weighing 1900 mg (0.07 oz), the fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates, such as <a href="kangaroo">kangaroo</a>s, <a href="Phalangeriformes">possums</a> and <a href="currawong">currawong</a>s and other large birds. Seeds have been recorded in the faeces of the <a href="brush-tailed%20rock-wallaby">brush-tailed rock-wallaby</a> ("Petrogale penicillata").

"Persoonia linearis" is useful as a <a href="Hedge">hedging</a> plant and responds well to <a href="pruning">pruning</a>. Its foliage has been used in <a href="Floristry">floral arrangements</a>, and its colourful bark is a horticultural feature. It is a fairly easy plant to grow in gardens, but is rarely seen due to difficulties in <a href="Plant%20propagation">propagation</a>. <a href="Germination">Germination</a> from seed is low, and can take many months. Once established it can tolerate extended dry periods and is hardy to frosts. Optimum growing conditions are part shade and a well-drained <a href="soil%20pH">acid soil</a>, though "P. linearis" grows readily in full sun. Persoonias in general are sensitive to excessive <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, and grow without fertiliser or with low-phosphorus <a href="Slow%20release">slow-release</a> formulations. They can also become deficient in <a href="Iron%20deficiency%20%28plant%20disorder%29">iron</a> and <a href="Manganese%20deficiency%20%28plant%29">manganese</a>. First cultivated in England in 1794 from seed, it was also reportedly propagated from <a href="Cutting%20%28plant%29">cuttings</a>; Andrews described it as a "handsome greenhouse plant, continuing to flower through the autumnal months and producing good seeds." Joseph Knight reported that cuttings would be successful as long as material was "judiciously chosen", and that plants had set seed on occasion.

Persoonia lanceolata

Persoonia lanceolata, commonly known as lance-leaf geebung, is a shrub native to <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> in eastern Australia. It reaches in height and has smooth grey bark and bright green foliage. Its small yellow flowers grow on <a href="raceme">raceme</a>s and appear in the austral summer and autumn (January to April), followed by green fleshy fruits (known as <a href="drupe">drupe</a>s) which ripen the following spring (September to October). Within the genus "<a href="Persoonia">Persoonia</a>", "P. lanceolata" belongs to the lanceolata group of 58 closely related species. It interbreeds with several other species found in its range.

The species is usually found in dry <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest on <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>-based nutrient-deficient soil. It has adapted to a fire-prone environment; plants lost in bushfires can regenerate through a <a href="soil%20seed%20bank">ground-stored seed bank</a>. Seedlings mostly germinate within two years of fires. Several species of native bee of the genus "<a href="Leioproctus">Leioproctus</a>" pollinate the flowers. <a href="Swamp%20Wallaby">Swamp wallabies</a> are a main consumer of its fruit, and the seeds are spread in wallaby <a href="feces">faeces</a>. Its lifespan ranges from 25 to 60 years, though difficulties in propagation have seen low cultivation rates.

"Persoonia lanceolata" was officially described in 1799 by <a href="Henry%20Charles%20Andrews">Henry Charles Andrews</a> from a plant grown from seeds by L. Wilson in <a href="Islington">Islington</a>. Andrews also described some plants which he had grown from seed in a nursery in <a href="Hammersmith">Hammersmith</a> as "P. latifolia", which turned out to be the same species. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word "lanceolata", meaning "spear-shaped", and refers to the shape of the leaves. Lance-leaf geebung is the common name. The term geebung is derived from the <a href="Dharug%20language">Dharug language</a> word "geebung". German botanist <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> coined the binomial name "Linkia lanceolata" in 1891, from <a href="Antonio%20Jos%C3%A9%20Cavanilles">Cavanilles</a>' original description of the genus description "Linkia", but the name was eventually rejected in favour of "Persoonia". The horticulturist <a href="Joseph%20Knight%20%28horticulturist%29">Joseph Knight</a> described this species as the privet-like persoonia ("Persoonia ligustrina") in his controversial 1809 work "<a href="On%20the%20cultivation%20of%20the%20plants%20belonging%20to%20the%20natural%20order%20of%20Proteeae">On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae</a>", but the binomial name was declared an <a href="illegitimate%20name">illegitimate name</a> as it postdated Andrews' description and name. <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> used Andrews' name in his 1810 work "<a href="Prodromus%20Florae%20Novae%20Hollandiae%20et%20Insulae%20Van%20Diemen">Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen</a>".

In 1870, <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> published the first <a href="wikt%3Ainfrageneric">infrageneric</a> arrangement of "<a href="Persoonia">Persoonia</a>" in Volume 5 of his landmark "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>". He divided the genus into three <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">sections</a>, placing "P. lanceolata" in "P." sect. "Amblyanthera". The genus was reviewed by Peter Weston for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" treatment in 1995, and "P. lanceolata" gave its name to the "lanceolata" group, a group of 58 closely related species with similar flowers but very different foliage. These species often interbreed with each other where two members of the group occur, and hybrids of "P. lanceolata" with "<a href="Persoonia%20katerae">P. katerae</a>", "<a href="Persoonia%20levis">P. levis</a>", "<a href="Persoonia%20linearis">P. linearis</a>", "<a href="Persoonia%20stradbrokensis">P. stradbrokensis</a>" and "<a href="Persoonia%20virgata">P. virgata</a>" have been recorded. The <a href="wikt%3Aglaucous">glaucous</a>-leaved "<a href="Persoonia%20glaucescens">P. glaucescens</a>" was formerly considered a subspecies of "P. lanceolata", but no intermediate forms have been recorded from where the two taxa grow together near <a href="Hill%20Top%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Hill Top</a> in the <a href="Southern%20Highlands%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Southern Highlands</a>. "P. lanceolata" has seven chromosomes, as do most other members of the genus, and they are large compared to those of other proteaceae.

"Persoonia lanceolata" is a shrub which ranges from high. The grey bark is smooth, and the new growth is hairy. Arranged alternately on the stems, the thick leathery leaves are <a href="wikt%3Aoblanceolate">oblanceolate</a> or <a href="wikt%3Aobovate">obovate</a> in shape, and measure in length, and around wide. Hairy when young, they are smooth and featureless. Bright green in colour with a yellowish tint at times, the leaves are <a href="wikt%3Aconcolorous">concolorous</a>, that is both leaf surfaces are the same colour. The finely hairy yellow flowers appear mainly from January to April, but may be encountered at any time of year. They are arranged in leafy <a href="raceme">raceme</a>s, and each stem may bear 4 to 54 flowers. "P. lanceolata" is described as auxotelic, which means each stalk bears an individual flower that is subtended by a leaf at its junction with the stem. On stalks, the flowers may reach in dimensions, and are typical for the genus.

Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical <a href="Petal%23Corolla">perianth</a> which splits into four segments or <a href="tepal">tepal</a>s, and contains both male and female parts. Within this, the central style is surrounded by the <a href="Stamen">anther</a>, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the <a href="Stigma%20%28botany%29">stigma</a>, which is located at the tip of the style. The smooth fleshy <a href="drupe">drupe</a>s are green and more or less round, measuring by in diameter. Containing two seeds, they weigh around and become partly red as they ripen and fall to the ground the following spring (September to October). Once fallen to the ground, the drupes soften and become a dark red over two to three weeks before shrivelling and blackening. The drupes are edible and were eaten by the local aboriginal people.

The firm bark and lanceolate leaves of "P. lanceolata" distinguish it from "P. levis", with which it can be confused; the latter species has flaky bark and asymmetrical leaves.

"Persoonia lanceolata" is found along coastal and near-coastal areas of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> east of the <a href="Great%20Dividing%20Range">Great Dividing Range</a>, from <a href="Trial%20Bay">Trial Bay</a> on the <a href="Mid%20North%20Coast%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Mid North Coast</a> to Sassafras <a href="Morton%20National%20Park">Morton National Park</a> in the south. Its habitat extends to dry <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest and heathland on <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>-based soils low in nutrients, particularly on the tops of ridges and slopes. Examples in more sheltered areas are often taller than those in more exposed areas. "P. lanceolata" is found from sea level to an altitude of , and the annual rainfall of the area it occurs in the Sydney Basin is . The species is considered adequately protected in the Sydney region and is found in <a href="Bouddi%20National%20Park">Bouddi</a>, <a href="Brisbane%20Water%20National%20Park">Brisbane Water</a>, <a href="Marramarra%20National%20Park">Marramarra</a>, Ku-ring-gai Chase, Lane Cove, <a href="Sydney%20Harbour%20National%20Park">Sydney Harbour</a> and <a href="Botany%20Bay%20National%20Park">Botany Bay National Park</a>s. In heathland habitats, "P. lanceolata" grows with such species as "<a href="Banksia%20ericifolia">Banksia ericifolia</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20oblongifolia">B. oblongifolia</a>" and "<a href="Darwinia%20fascicularis">Darwinia fascicularis</a>". In more forested areas it is an <a href="understory">understory</a> shrub alongside "<a href="Lambertia%20formosa">Lambertia formosa</a>", "<a href="Leptospermum%20trinervium">Leptospermum trinervium</a>", "<a href="Daviesia%20corymbosa">Daviesia corymbosa</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20serrata">Banksia serrata</a>" and "B. ericifolia" under such trees as "<a href="Eucalyptus%20sclerophylla">Eucalyptus sclerophylla</a>", "<a href="Eucalyptus%20piperita">E. piperita</a>", "<a href="Eucalyptus%20sieberi">E. sieberi</a>", "<a href="Eucalyptus%20sparsifolia">E. sparsifolia</a>", "<a href="Eucalyptus%20punctata">E. punctata</a>" and "<a href="Corymbia%20gummifera">Corymbia gummifera</a>".

The <a href="swamp%20wallaby">swamp wallaby</a> ("Wallabia bicolor") feeds on the fallen fruit of "P. lanceolata" and disperses the seed through its <a href="feces">scat</a> (dung). A field study in <a href="Ku-ring-gai%20Chase%20National%20Park">Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park</a> found that 88% of seeds in the scat were still viable although dormant. The <a href="Red-necked%20Wallaby">red-necked wallaby</a> ("Macropus rufogriseus") feeds on drupes and is a likely seed dispersal agent. Animals can convey seed for one or two kilometres from where they have fed. Rodents such as the <a href="bush%20rat">bush rat</a> ("Rattus fuscipes") and <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a> ("Rattus rattus") eat the drupes but chew the seed so that only fragments leave their digestive system. <a href="Red%20fox">Foxes</a> have been reported to eat the fruit, and <a href="kangaroo">kangaroo</a>s and large birds such as <a href="currawong">currawong</a>s are thought to as well.

<a href="Colletidae">Colletid</a> bees of the genus "<a href="Leioproctus">Leioproctus</a>", subgenus "Cladocerapis", forage exclusively on and pollinate flowers of many species of "Persoonia". Bees of the subgenus "<a href="Filiglossa">Filiglossa</a>" in the same genus also feed only on "Persoonia" flowers but do not appear to be effective pollinators. Recorded species include the longtongue bees "<a href="Leioproctus%20carinatifrons">Leioproctus (Cladocerapis) carinatifrons</a>", "<a href="Leioproctus%20incanescens">L. incanescens</a>", and "<a href="Leioproctus%20speculiferus">L. speculiferus</a>", as well as "<a href="Leioproctus%20filamentosa">Leioproctus filamentosa</a>" and "<a href="Exoneura">Exoneura</a>" species. The <a href="Apis%20mellifera">European honeybee</a> ("Apis mellifera") is a common visitor to flowers, although its effectiveness as a pollinator is unclear. "Persoonia lanceolata" is an obligate outcrosser, that is, flowers need to be pollinated by pollen from other plants, and honeybees tend to forage more on different flowers of the same plant than between plants, as native bees do. Their abundance might be impacting the pollination success of native bees in this and other "Persoonia" species. 

Infection by the fungal species "<a href="Anthracostroma%20persooniae">Anthracostroma persooniae</a>" and "<a href="Camarosporula%20persooniae">Camarosporula persooniae</a>" results in leaf spot disease.

"P. lanceolata" shrubs destroyed by <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a> regenerate through seedlings surviving through seedbank in the soil. The Ku-ring-gai Chase study found that seedlings germinated within two years of a 1994 bushfire, although some appeared up to six years afterwards, while germination was not related to any particular season. Plants take six years to reach maturity. Thus, more frequent bushfires prevent recruitment and hence endanger populations. However, plants in <a href="Lane%20Cove%20National%20Park">Lane Cove National Park</a> were recorded maturing three years after an especially intense bushfire. What triggers germination is unknown, and seedlings have also arisen from areas disturbed by <a href="sand%20mining">sand mining</a>, sometimes growing in higher concentrations than before the disturbance. The natural lifespan of a plant appears to range from 25 to 60 years.

"Persoonia lanceolata" is rarely seen in cultivation, mainly due to difficulties in <a href="Plant%20propagation">propagation</a>; seed germination is unpredictable, and <a href="Cutting%20%28plant%29">cuttings</a> have proven difficult to strike. Nevertheless, its bright green hue is considered an attractive horticultural feature. Well drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for this plant in a garden setting. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells, and grows fairly readily in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England were able to germinate seed there in 1791.

Drupes were eaten by indigenous people on the Beecroft Peninsula, and were preferred over those of "<a href="Persoonia%20laurina">P. laurina</a>".

Subfossil lemur

Subfossil lemurs are <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s from <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> that are represented by recent (<a href="subfossil">subfossil</a>) remains dating from nearly 26,000 years ago to approximately 560 years ago (from the <a href="late%20Pleistocene">late Pleistocene</a> until the <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a>). They include both living and <a href="Extinction">extinct</a> species, although the term more frequently refers to the extinct giant lemurs. The diversity of subfossil lemur communities was greater than that of present-day lemur communities, ranging from as high as 20 or more species per location, compared with 10 to 12 species today. Extinct species are estimated to have ranged in size from slightly over to roughly . Even the subfossil remains of living species are larger and more robust than the skeletal remains of modern specimens. The subfossil sites found around most of the island demonstrate that most giant lemurs had wide distributions and that ranges of living species have contracted significantly since the arrival of humans.

Despite their size, the giant lemurs shared many features with living lemurs, including rapid development, poor day vision, relatively small brains, and lack of male dominance. They also had many distinct traits among lemurs, including a tendency to rely on <a href="terrestrial%20locomotion">terrestrial locomotion</a>, slow climbing, and <a href="Suspensory%20behavior">suspension</a> instead of leaping, as well as a greater dependence on <a href="Folivore">leaf-eating</a> and <a href="Seed%20predator">seed predation</a>. The giant lemurs likely filled <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>s now left vacant, particularly <a href="seed%20dispersal">seed dispersal</a> for plants with large seeds. There were three distinct families of giant lemur, including the Palaeopropithecidae (<a href="sloth%20lemur">sloth lemur</a>s), Megaladapidae (<a href="koala%20lemur">koala lemur</a>s), and Archaeolemuridae (<a href="monkey%20lemur">monkey lemur</a>s). Two other types were more closely related and similar in appearance to living lemurs: the <a href="giant%20aye-aye">giant aye-aye</a> and "<a href="Pachylemur">Pachylemur</a>", a <a href="genus">genus</a> of "giant <a href="ruffed%20lemur">ruffed lemur</a>s".

Subfossil remains were first discovered on Madagascar in the 1860s, but giant lemur species were not formally described until the 1890s. The <a href="Paleontology">paleontological</a> interest sparked by the initial discoveries resulted in an overabundance of new species names, the allocation of bones to the wrong species, and inaccurate reconstructions during the early 20th century. Discoveries waned during the mid-20th century; paleontological work resumed in the 1980s and resulted in the discovery of new species and a new <a href="genus">genus</a>. Research has recently focused on diets, lifestyle, social behavior, and other aspects of biology. The remains of the subfossil lemurs are relatively recent, with all or most species dating within the last 2,000 years. Humans first arrived on Madagascar around that time and hunting likely played a role in the rapid decline of the lemurs and the other <a href="megafauna">megafauna</a> that once existed on the large island. Additional factors are thought to have contributed to their ultimate disappearance. <a href="Oral%20tradition">Oral tradition</a>s and recent reports of sightings by <a href="Malagasy%20people">Malagasy</a> villagers have been interpreted by some as suggesting either lingering populations or very recent extinctions.

Until recently, giant lemurs existed in Madagascar. Although they are only represented by <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> remains, they were modern forms, having adaptations unlike those seen in lemurs today, and are counted as part of the rich lemur diversity that has evolved in isolation for up to 60 million years. All 17 extinct lemurs were larger than the extant forms, including the largest living lemurs, the <a href="indri">indri</a> ("Indri indri") and <a href="diademed%20sifaka">diademed sifaka</a> ("Propithecus diadema"), which weigh up to . The estimated weights for the subfossil lemurs have varied. Techniques used for these weight estimations include the comparison of skull lengths, tooth size, the head diameter of the <a href="femur">femur</a>, and more recently, the area of <a href="cortical%20bone">cortical bone</a> (hard bone) in <a href="long%20bone">long bone</a>s (such as the <a href="humerus">humerus</a>). Despite the variations in the size estimates for some species, all subfossil lemurs were larger than living species, weighing or more, and one species may have weighed as much as .

All but one species, the <a href="giant%20aye-aye">giant aye-aye</a>, are thought to have been active during the day. Not only were they unlike the living lemurs in both size and appearance, they also filled <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>s that no longer exist or are now left unoccupied. Their remains have been found in most parts of the island, except for the eastern rainforests and the <a href="Sambirano%20domain">Sambirano domain</a> (seasonal moist forests in the northwest of the island), where no subfossil sites are known. <a href="Radiocarbon%20dating">Radiocarbon dates</a> for subfossil lemur remains range from approximately 26,000 years <a href="Before%20Present">BP</a> (for "<a href="Megaladapis">Megaladapis</a>" in northern Madagascar at the <a href="Ankarana%20Reserve">Ankarana Massif</a>) to around 500 years BP (for "<a href="Palaeopropithecus">Palaeopropithecus</a>" in the southwest).

All of the extinct subfossil lemurs, including the smallest species ("<a href="Pachylemur">Pachylemur</a>", "<a href="Mesopropithecus">Mesopropithecus</a>", and the giant aye-aye), were larger than the lemur species alive today. The largest species were among the largest <a href="primate">primate</a>s ever to have evolved. Due to their larger size, the extinct subfossil lemurs have been compared to large-bodied <a href="Simian">anthropoids</a> (monkeys and apes), yet they more closely resemble the small-bodied lemurs. Like other lemurs, the subfossil lemurs did not exhibit appreciable differences in body or <a href="canine%20tooth">canine tooth</a> size between males and females (<a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>). This suggests that they, too, exhibited <a href="Dominance%20%28ethology%29">female social dominance</a>, possibly exhibiting the same levels of <a href="Agonistic%20behaviour">agonism</a> (aggressive competition) seen in extant lemurs. Like other lemurs, they had smaller brains than comparably sized anthropoids. Most species also had a unique <a href="strepsirrhine">strepsirrhine</a> dental trait, called a <a href="toothcomb">toothcomb</a>, which is used for <a href="Personal%20grooming">grooming</a>. Even <a href="tooth%20development">tooth development</a> and <a href="weaning">weaning</a> was rapid compared to similarly sized anthropoids, suggesting faster <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a> of their offspring. Most subfossil lemurs also had high <a href="retinal%20summation">retinal summation</a> (sensitivity to low light), resulting in poor day vision (low <a href="visual%20acuity">visual acuity</a>) compared to anthropoids. This has been demonstrated by the ratio between their relatively small <a href="Orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbits</a> (eye sockets) and the relative size of their <a href="optic%20canal">optic canal</a>, which is comparable to that of other lemurs, not diurnal anthropoids.

These traits are shared among both living and extinct lemurs, but are uncommon among primates in general. Two prevailing hypotheses to explain these unique adaptations are the "energy frugality hypothesis" by <a href="Patricia%20Wright">Patricia Wright</a> (1999) and the "evolutionary disequilibrium hypothesis" by Carel van Schaik and Peter M. Kappeler (1996). The energy frugality hypothesis expanded on <a href="Alison%20Jolly">Alison Jolly</a>'s energy conservation hypotheses by claiming that most lemur traits not only help conserve energy, but also maximize the use of highly limited resources, enabling them to live in severely seasonal environments with low productivity. The evolutionary disequilibrium hypothesis postulated that living lemurs are in the process of evolving to fill open ecological niches left by the recently extinct subfossil lemurs. For example, small nocturnal prosimians are typically nocturnal and monogamous, while the larger living lemurs are generally active both day and night (<a href="cathemeral">cathemeral</a>) and live in small groups (<a href="Social%20behavior">gregarious</a>). Cathemerality and increased gregariousness might indicate that the larger living lemurs are evolving to fill the role of the giant lemurs, which were thought to be <a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a> (day-living) and more monkey-like in behavior. Since most giant subfossil lemurs have been shown to share many of the unique traits of their living counterparts, and not those of <a href="monkey">monkey</a>s, Godfrey "et al". (2003) argued that the energy frugality hypothesis seems to best explain both living and extinct lemur adaptations.
Despite the similarities, subfossil lemurs had several distinct differences from their lemur relatives. In addition to being larger, the subfossil lemurs were more dependent on leaves and seeds in their diet, rather than fruit. They utilized slow climbing, hanging, and terrestrial <a href="quadrupedalism">quadrupedalism</a> for <a href="Terrestrial%20locomotion">locomotion</a>, rather than <a href="vertical%20clinging%20and%20leaping">vertical clinging and leaping</a> and <a href="Arboreal%20locomotion">arboreal</a> quadrupedalism. Also, all but one of them—the giant aye-aye—are assumed to have been diurnal (due to their body size and small <a href="Orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbits</a>), whereas many small lemurs are <a href="Nocturnality">nocturnal</a> and medium-sized are cathemeral.

Their skeletons suggest that most subfossil lemurs were tree-dwellers, adapted for living in forests and possibly limited to such habitats. Unlike some of the living species, the subfossil lemurs lacked adaptations for leaping. Instead, <a href="Suspensory%20behavior">suspension</a>, used by some <a href="Indriidae">indriids</a> and <a href="ruffed%20lemur">ruffed lemur</a>s, was extensively used in some lineages. Living lemurs are known to visit the ground to varying extents, but only the extinct archaeolemurids exhibit adaptations for semiterrestrial locomotion. Due to the size of the extinct subfossil lemurs, all were likely to travel on the ground between trees. They had shorter, more robust limbs, heavily built <a href="axial%20skeleton">axial skeleton</a>s (trunks), and large heads and are thought to have shared the common lemur trait of low <a href="basal%20metabolic%20rate">basal metabolic rate</a>s, making them slow-moving. Studies of their <a href="semicircular%20canal">semicircular canal</a>s confirm this assumption, showing that koala lemurs moved slower than orangutans, monkey lemurs were less agile than <a href="Old%20World%20monkey">Old World monkey</a>s, and sloth lemurs exhibited slow movements like those of lorises and sloths.

The sloth lemurs (<a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Palaeopropithecidae) were the most species-rich group of the subfossil lemurs, with four genera and eight species. The <a href="common%20name">common name</a> is due to strong similarities in <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> with arboreal sloths, or in the case of "<a href="Archaeoindris">Archaeoindris</a>", with giant ground sloths. They ranged in size from some of the smallest of the subfossil lemurs, such as "<a href="Mesopropithecus">Mesopropithecus</a>", weighing as little as , to the largest, "<a href="Archaeoindris">Archaeoindris</a>", weighing approximately . Their characteristic curved finger and toe bones (<a href="Phalanx%20bones">phalanges</a>) suggest slow suspensory movement, similar to that of an <a href="orangutan">orangutan</a> or a <a href="loris">loris</a>, making them some of the most specialized mammals for <a href="Suspensory%20behavior">suspension</a>. Their day vision was very poor, and they had relatively small brains and short tails. Their diet consisted mostly of leaves, seeds, and fruit; dental wear analysis suggests they were primarily folivorous seed-predators.

The koala lemurs of the family Megaladapidae most closely resemble <a href="marsupial">marsupial</a> koalas from Australia. According to genetic evidence they were most closely related to the family <a href="Lemuridae">Lemuridae</a>, although for many years they were paired with the <a href="sportive%20lemur">sportive lemur</a>s of the family Lepilemuridae due to similarities in their skulls and <a href="Molar%20%28tooth%29">molar teeth</a>. They were slow climbers and had long forelimbs and powerful grasping feet, possibly using them for suspension. Koala lemurs ranged in size from an estimated , making them as large as a male orangutan or a female gorilla. They had poor day vision, short tails, lacked permanent upper <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s, and had a reduced toothcomb. Their diet generally consisted of leaves, with some species being specialized <a href="folivore">folivore</a>s and others having a broader diet, possibly including tough seeds.

Monkey lemurs, or baboon lemurs, share similarities with <a href="macaque">macaque</a>s; they have also been compared to <a href="baboon">baboon</a>s. Members of the family Archaeolemuridae, they were the most terrestrial of the lemurs, with short, robust forelimbs and relatively flat digits. They spent time on the ground, and were semi-terrestrial, spending time in trees to feed and sleep. They were heavy-bodied and ranged in size from approximately . They had relatively good day vision and large brains compared with other lemurs. Their robust jaws and specialized teeth suggest a diet of hard objects, such as nuts and seeds, yet other evidence, including fecal pellets, suggests they may have had a more varied diet, including leaves, fruit, and animal matter (<a href="Omnivore">omnivory</a>). Dental wear analysis has shed some light on this dietary mystery, suggesting that monkey lemurs had a more eclectic diet, while using tough seeds as a fall-back food item. Within the family, the genus "Archaeolemur" was the most widespread in distribution, resulting in hundreds of subfossil specimens, and may have been one of the last subfossil lemurs to die out.


An extinct, giant relative of the living <a href="aye-aye">aye-aye</a>, the giant aye-aye shared at least two of the aye-aye's bizarre traits: ever-growing central incisors and an elongated, skinny middle finger. These shared features suggest a similar lifestyle and diet, focused on <a href="percussive%20foraging">percussive foraging</a> (tapping with the skinny digit and listening for reverberation from hollow spots) of defended resources, such as hard nuts and invertebrate larvae concealed inside decaying wood. Weighing as much as , it was between two-and-half and five times the size of living aye-aye. Alive when humans came to Madagascar, its teeth were collected and drilled to make necklaces.


The only extinct member of the family Lemuridae, the genus "Pachylemur" contains two species that closely resembled living ruffed lemurs. Sometimes referred to as "giant ruffed lemurs", they were approximately three times larger than ruffed lemurs, weighing between . Despite their size, they were arboreal quadrupeds, possibly utilizing more suspensory behavior and cautious climbing than their sister taxon. Their skull and teeth were similar to those of ruffed lemurs, suggesting a diet high in fruit and possibly some leaves. The rest of its skeleton (<a href="postcrania">postcrania</a>) was much more robust and their vertebrae had distinctly different features.

Determining the <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogeny</a> of subfossil lemurs has been problematic because studies of <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>, <a href="developmental%20biology">developmental biology</a>, and <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetics</a> have sometimes yielded conflicting results. All studies agree that the family Daubentoniidae (including the giant aye-aye) diverged first from the other lemurs at least 60 million years ago. The relationship between the remaining families has been less clear. Morphological, developmental, and molecular studies have offered support for lumping the four sloth lemur genera of the family Palaeopropithecidae with the family <a href="Indriidae">Indriidae</a> (including the indri, sifakas, and <a href="woolly%20lemur">woolly lemur</a>s). The placement of family Megaladapidae has been more controversial, with similarities in teeth and skull features suggesting a close relationship with family Lepilemuridae (<a href="sportive%20lemur">sportive lemur</a>s). Molecular data, instead, indicate a closer relationship to family Lemuridae. Likewise, a relationship between family Archaeolemuridae and family Lemuridae has been suggested, based on morphological and developmental traits, yet molar morphology, the number of teeth in the specialized toothcomb, and molecular analysis support a closer relationship with the indriid–sloth lemur <a href="Cladistics">clade</a>. Other subfossil lemurs, including the giant aye-aye and "Pachylemur", are more easily placed due to strong similarities with existing lemurs (the aye-aye and ruffed lemurs, respectively).

<a href="List%20of%20subfossil%20sites%20in%20Madagascar">Subfossil sites in Madagascar</a> have yielded the remains of more than just extinct lemurs. Extant lemur remains have also been found, and radiocarbon dating has demonstrated that both types of lemur lived at the same time. In some cases living species are <a href="Local%20extinction">locally extinct</a> for the area in which their subfossil remains were found. Because subfossil sites are found across most of the island, with the most notable exception being the eastern rainforest, both paleocommunity composition and paleodistributions can be determined. <a href="Range%20%28biology%29">Geographic ranges</a> have contracted for numerous species, including the indri, <a href="greater%20bamboo%20lemur">greater bamboo lemur</a>, and ruffed lemurs. For instance, subfossil remains of the indri have been found in marsh deposits near <a href="Ampasambazimba">Ampasambazimba</a> in the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Madagascar%29">Central Highlands</a> and in other deposits in both central and northern Madagascar, demonstrating a much larger range than the small region on the east coast that it currently occupies. Even the greater bamboo lemur, a critically endangered species restricted to a small portion of the south-central eastern rainforest, has undergone significant range contraction since the mid-<a href="Holocene">Holocene</a>, with subfossil remains from <a href="Ankarana%20Reserve">Ankarana Massif</a> in the far north of Madagascar dating to 2565 <a href="Common%20Era">BCE</a> ± 70 years. Combined with finds from other subfossil sites, data suggests that it used to range across the northern, northwestern, central, and eastern parts of the island. It is unclear whether these locations were <a href="Mesic%20habitat">wetter</a> in the past or whether distinct subpopulations or <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> occupied the drier forests, much like modern diversity of <a href="sifaka">sifaka</a>s.

In addition to previously having expanded geographic ranges, extant subfossil lemurs exhibited significant variation in size. Researchers have noted that subfossil bones of living species are more robust and generally larger than their present-day counterparts. The relative size of living species may be related to regional ecological factors, such as resource seasonality, a trend that is still observable today, where individuals from the <a href="Madagascar%20spiny%20thickets">spiny forests</a> are, on average, smaller than individuals from the southwestern <a href="Madagascar%20succulent%20woodlands">succulent woodlands</a> or the <a href="Madagascar%20dry%20deciduous%20forests">dry deciduous forests</a>.

As a group, the lemurs of Madagascar are extremely diverse, having evolved in isolation and <a href="Adaptive%20radiation">radiated</a> over the past 40 to 60 million years to fill many <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>s normally occupied by other primates. In the recent past, their diversity was significantly greater, with 17 extinct species sharing body proportions and specializations with <a href="loris">loris</a>es and various non-primates, such as <a href="Sloth">tree sloths</a>, giant <a href="ground%20sloth">ground sloth</a>s, <a href="koala">koala</a>s, and striped possums (genus "<a href="Dactylopsila">Dactylopsila</a>"). The diversity of lemur communities today can be as high as 10 to 12 species per region; communities of 20 or more lemur species existed as recently as 1,000 years ago in areas that now have no lemurs at all. Just like living species, many of the extinct species shared overlapping ranges with closely related species (<a href="sympatry">sympatry</a>) through <a href="niche%20differentiation">niche differentiation</a> (resource partitioning). Among all the late <a href="Quaternary">Quaternary</a> assemblages of <a href="megafauna">megafauna</a>, only Madagascar was dominated by large primates.
Although anatomical evidence suggests that even the large, extinct species were adapted to tree-climbing, some habitats, including <a href="gallery%20forest">gallery forest</a>s and the spiny forests of southern Madagascar, in which they occurred would not have allowed them to be strictly arboreal. Even today, most lemur species will visit the ground to cross open areas, suggesting that the extinct species did the same. Monkey lemurs (family Archaeolemuridae), including "<a href="Archaeolemur">Archaeolemur majori</a>" and "<a href="Hadropithecus">Hadropithecus stenognathus</a>", have been reconstructed as being primarily <a href="Terrestrial%20animal">terrestrial</a>. In contrast, the sloth lemurs (family Palaeopropithecidae) were highly arboreal despite the large size of some species.

Species of both extinct and living (extant) lemur vary in size based on habitat conditions, despite their differences in niche preference. Within <a href="taxa">related groups</a>, larger species tend to inhabit wetter, more productive <a href="habitat">habitat</a>s, while smaller sister taxa are found in drier, less productive habitats. This pattern suggests that populations of both living and extinct lemur species had become geographically isolated by differences in habitat and <a href="allopatric%20speciation">evolved in isolation</a> due to varying <a href="primary%20production">primary production</a> within different <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s. <a href="Thermoregulation">Thermoregulation</a> may also have played a role in the evolution of their increased body size. Yet despite this pressure to specialize and differentiate, some of the extinct subfossil lemurs, such as "Archaeolemur", may have had island-wide distributions during the Holocene, unlike the living lemurs. If this is the case, it may suggest that some larger lemurs might have been more tolerant to regional differences in ecology than living lemurs.

Research on subfossil lemur diets, particularly in southern and southwestern Madagascar, has indicated that ecological communities have been significantly affected by their recent extinction. Many extinct subfossil lemurs were large-bodied leaf-eaters (<a href="folivore">folivore</a>s), seed predators, or both. Today, leaf-eating along with seed predation is only seen in mid-sized lemurs, and is far less common than it was in the past. Strict folivory is also less common, now found primarily in small lemurs. In certain cases, subfossil lemurs, such as the sloth lemurs and koala lemurs, may have used leaves as an important fallback food, whereas other species, such as the monkey lemurs and the giant aye-aye, specialized on structurally defended resources, such as hard seeds and wood-boring insect larvae. Last, "Pachylemur" was primarily a fruit eater (<a href="Frugivore">frugivorous</a>). Subfossil lemur diets have been reconstructed using analytical tools, including techniques to compare tooth anatomy, structure, and wear; <a href="biogeochemistry">biogeochemistry</a> (analysis of <a href="isotope">isotope</a> levels, like <a href="carbon-13">carbon-13</a>); and the dissection of <a href="Feces">fecal pellets</a> associated with subfossil remains.

The diets of most subfossil lemurs, most notably "Palaeopropithecus" and "Megaladapis", consisted primarily of <a href="C3%20carbon%20fixation">C plants</a>, which use a form of <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> that results in higher water loss through <a href="transpiration">transpiration</a>. Other subfossil lemurs, such as "Hadropithecus" and "Mesopropithecus", fed on <a href="Crassulacean%20acid%20metabolism">CAM</a> and <a href="C4%20carbon%20fixation">C plants</a>, which use more water-efficient forms of photosynthesis. <a href="Fruit">Fruit</a> and animal matter was more common in the diets of subfossil lemurs including "Pachylemur", "Archaeolemur", and the giant aye-aye. In southern and southwestern Madagascar, the subfossil lemurs of the spiny forests generally favored the C plants over the more abundant CAM plants, although closely related sympatric species may have fed upon the two types of plants in different ratios, allowing each to divide resources and coexist. Since plants produce defenses against leaf-eating animals, the extensive use of spines by plants in the spiny forests suggest that they evolved to cope with leaf-eating lemurs, large and small.

Giant subfossil lemurs are thought to have also played a significant role in <a href="seed%20dispersal">seed dispersal</a>, possibly targeting species that did not attract the seed dispersal services of the extinct <a href="elephant%20bird">elephant bird</a>s. Biogeochemistry studies have shown that they may have been the primary seed dispersers for the <a href="endemic">endemic</a> and native C trees in the spiny forests. Terrestrial species may have dispersed seeds for small bushes as well as tall trees. Seed dispersal can involve passing seeds through the gut (<a href="Seed%20dispersal%23By%20animals">endozoochory</a>) or attaching the seeds to the animal's body (<a href="Seed%20dispersal%23By%20animals">epizoochory</a>), and both processes probably occurred with subfossil lemurs. Seeds from "<a href="Uncarina">Uncarina</a>" species embed themselves in lemur fur, and likely did the same with subfossil lemurs. Seed dispersal biology is known for very few species in the spiny forest, including <a href="genus">genera</a> of plants suspected of depending on giant lemurs, such as "<a href="Adansonia">Adansonia</a>", "<a href="Cedrelopsis">Cedrelopsis</a>", "<a href="Commiphora">Commiphora</a>", "<a href="Delonix">Delonix</a>", "<a href="Diospyros">Diospyros</a>", "<a href="Grewia">Grewia</a>", "<a href="Pachypodium">Pachypodium</a>", "<a href="Salvadora%20%28plant%29">Salvadora</a>", "<a href="Strychnos">Strychnos</a>", and "<a href="Tamarind">Tamarind</a>us". For example, "Delonix" has edible pods that are rich in protein, and "Adansonia" fruits have a nutritious pulp and large seeds that may have been dispersed by "Archaeolemur majori" or "Pachylemur insignis".

Seed size may be a limiting factor for some plant species, since their seeds are too large for living (<a href="Extant%20taxon">extant</a>) lemurs. The common brown lemur ("Eulemur fulvus") can swallow seeds in diameter, while the <a href="black-and-white%20ruffed%20lemur">black-and-white ruffed lemur</a> ("Varecia variegata") is capable of swallowing seeds up to in diameter. A large lemur, such as "Pachylemur", which was more than twice the size of today's <a href="ruffed%20lemur">ruffed lemur</a>s, could probably swallow even larger seeds. Seed dispersal limitations tied to megafaunal extinction are exhibited by "<a href="Commiphora">Commiphora</a> guillaminii". At present, this tree species has a short dispersal distance, but its <a href="genetics">genetics</a> indicate higher levels of regional <a href="gene%20flow">gene flow</a> in the past, based on comparisons with a closely related species in Africa whose seeds are still dispersed by large animals.

The writings of French colonial governor <a href="%C3%89tienne%20de%20Flacourt">Étienne de Flacourt</a> in the mid-17th century introduced the existence of giant Malagasy mammals to Western science with recorded eye-witness accounts from the local people of dangerous animals, hornless "water cows", and a large lemur-like creature referred to locally as the "tretretretre" or "tratratratra". Today, the latter is thought to have been a species of "Palaeopropithecus" or possibly "Megaladapis". Flacourt described it as:

Local tales of a "song'aomby" (Malagasy for "cow that is not a cow"), or pygmy hippopotamus, led French naturalist <a href="Alfred%20Grandidier">Alfred Grandidier</a> to follow a village headman to a marsh in southwestern Madagascar, a site called <a href="Ambolisatra">Ambolisatra</a>, which became the first known subfossil site in Madagascar. In 1868, Grandidier uncovered the first subfossil remains of lemurs—a <a href="humerus">humerus</a> from "Palaeopropithecus" and a <a href="tibia">tibia</a> of a sifaka. The "Palaeopropithecus" remains were not described for several decades, and it took decades more for the remains to be correctly paired with other sloth lemur remains. It was not until 1893 that giant lemur species were formally described, when <a href="Charles%20Immanuel%20Forsyth%20Major">Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major</a> discovered and described a long, narrow skull of "Megaladapis madagascariensis" in a marsh. His discoveries in various marshes of central and southwestern Madagascar sparked <a href="Paleontology">paleontological</a> interest, resulting in an overabundance of <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic names</a> and confused assemblages of bones from numerous species, including non-primates. Specimens were distributed between European museums and Madagascar, often resulting in the loss of field data that went with the specimens, if the data had been recorded at all.

In 1905, Alfred Grandidier's son, <a href="Guillaume%20Grandidier">Guillaume Grandidier</a>, reviewed subfossil lemur taxonomy and determined that too many names had been created. His review established most of the presently known family and genera names for the extinct lemurs. Despite the taxonomic clarification, subfossil postcrania from different genera, particularly "Megaladapis", "Palaeopropithecus" and "Hadropithecus", continued to be incorrectly paired and sometimes assigned to non-primates. Since subfossil remains were often dredged from marshes one by one, pairing skulls with other bones was often guesswork based on size-matching, and was not very accurate as a consequence. Even as late as the 1950s, bones of non-primates were attributed to subfossil lemurs. One reconstruction of the confounded subfossil remains by paleontologist <a href="Herbert%20F.%20Standing">Herbert F. Standing</a> depicted "Palaeopropithecus" as an aquatic animal that swam near the surface, keeping its eyes, ears, and nostrils slightly above water. Postcranial remains of "Palaeopropithecus" had previously been paired with "Megaladapis" by Guillaume Grandidier, who viewed it as a giant tree sloth, which he named "Bradytherium". Standing's aquatic theory was supported by Italian paleontologist Giuseppe Sera, who reconstructed "Palaeopropithecus" as an "arboreal-aquatic acrobat" that not only swam in water but climbed trees and dove from there into the water. Sera took the aquatic theory further in 1938 by including other extinct lemurs, including "Megaladapis", which he viewed as a thin <a href="Batoidea">ray</a>-like swimmer that fed on mollusks and crustaceans while concealed underwater. It was primarily the paleontologist <a href="Charles%20Lamberton">Charles Lamberton</a> who correctly paired many of the confused subfossils, although others had also helped address problems of association and <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">taxonomic synonyms</a>. Lamberton also refuted Guillaume Grandidier's sloth theory for "Megaladapis", as well as the aquatic lemur theory of Standing and Sera.

Excavations during the early 20th century by researchers like Lamberton failed to unearth any new extinct lemur genera. Fourteen of the approximately seventeen known species had previously been identified from field work in southern, western, and central Madagascar. When paleontological field work resumed in the early 1980s, new finds provided associated skeletal remains, including rare bones such as <a href="Carpus">carpal bones</a> (wrist bones), <a href="Phalanx%20bones">phalanges</a> (finger and toe bones), and <a href="Baculum">bacula</a> (penile bone). In some cases, nearly complete hands and feet were found. Enough remains have been found for some groups to demonstrate the physical <a href="Ontogeny">development</a> of juveniles. Standard long-bone indices have been calculated in order to determine the <a href="intermembral%20index">intermembral index</a> (a ratio that compares limb proportions), and body mass estimates have been made based on long-bone circumference measurements. Even preserved <a href="Feces">fecal pellets</a> from "Archaeolemur" have been found, allowing researchers to learn about its diet. More recently, <a href="Electron%20microscope">electron microscopy</a> has allowed researchers to study behavioral patterns, and <a href="DNA%20replication">DNA amplification</a> has helped with genetic tests that determine the phylogenetic relationships between the extinct and living lemurs.

A new genus of sloth lemur, "<a href="Babakotia">Babakotia</a>", was discovered in 1986 by a team led by <a href="Elwyn%20L.%20Simons">Elwyn L. Simons</a> of <a href="Duke%20University">Duke University</a> in <a href="Karst%20topography">karst</a> caves on the <a href="Ankarana%20Massif">Ankarana Massif</a> in northern Madagascar. Along with "Babakotia", a new species of "Mesopropithecus", "M. dolichobrachion", was also discovered, but not formally described until 1995. The same team has also helped promote new ideas about sloth lemur adaptations and the relationships among the four genera. They have also provided evidence that living species, such as the indri and the greater gamboo lemur, have lost much of their original range. In 2009, a new species of large sloth lemur, called "Palaeopropithecus kelyus", was described from northwestern Madagascar by a Franco-Madagascan team. The new species was found to be smaller than the two previously known species from the genus, and its diet reportedly consisted of more hard-textured food. The resurgence in subfossil lemur work has also sparked new interest in Madagascar's small mammals, which have also been found at the subfossil sites. This has led to new ideas about the origins, diversity, and distribution of these animals.

The number of Malagasy subfossil sites containing subfossil lemurs has increased significantly since the mid-20th century. At that time, subfossil lemurs had only been found in the center, south, and southwest of the island. Since then, only the eastern rainforests have not been represented, and paleodistributions are now known for both extinct and living species around most of the island. Large quantities of subfossil lemur remains have been found in caves, marshes, and streambank sites in drier regions. The subfossil sites are clustered together geographically and are recent in age, mostly dating between 2,500 and 1,000 years old, with a few spanning back into the <a href="Last%20glacial%20period">last glaciation</a>, which ended 10,000 years ago.

At least 17 species of giant subfossil lemur vanished during the Holocene, with all or most extinctions happening after the colonization of Madagascar by humans around 2,000 years ago. Madagascar's <a href="megafauna">megafauna</a> included not only giant lemurs, but also <a href="elephant%20bird">elephant bird</a>s, <a href="giant%20tortoise">giant tortoise</a>s, several species of <a href="Malagasy%20Hippopotamus">Malagasy hippopotamuses</a>, "<a href="Cryptoprocta%20spelea">Cryptoprocta spelea</a>" (a "giant <a href="Fossa%20%28animal%29">fossa</a>"), large crocodiles ("<a href="Voay">Voay robustus</a>"), and "<a href="Plesiorycteropus">Plesiorycteropus</a>", a unique digging mammal, all of which died out during the same period. Madagascar's megafaunal extinctions were among the most severe for any continent or large island, with all endemic wildlife over disappearing, totaling approximately 25 species. The most severely impacted lemurs were generally large and diurnal, particularly the clade containing the living indriids and extinct sloth lemurs. Although only the indriids are alive today and represent only a small percentage of the living <a href="List%20of%20lemur%20species">lemur species</a>, this clade collectively contained the majority of the extinct giant lemur species.
By region, the Central Highlands lost the greatest number of lemur species. It has lost nearly all of its woodland habitat, but some lemur species still survive in isolated forest patches. Lemur diversity is tightly linked with plant diversity, which in turn decreases with increased <a href="forest%20fragmentation">forest fragmentation</a>. In extreme cases, treeless sites such as the town of Ampasambazimba from the central region no longer support any of the lemur species represented in their subfossil record. Other locations no longer have giant subfossil lemurs, yet they still maintain forested habitat that could support them. Even though the giant lemurs have disappeared from these locations, while the smaller species survive in the forest patches that remain, the subfossil remains indicate that the living species used to be more widespread and coexisted with the extinct species. The Central Highlands saw the greatest species loss, but was not the only region or habitat type to witness extinctions. The least-understood region is the eastern rainforests, which have not yielded subfossil lemur remains. Consequently, it is impossible to know what percentage of lemur taxa were recently lost there; studies of Malagasy customs (<a href="ethnohistory">ethnohistory</a>) along with archaeological evidence suggests the eastern rainforests were more <a href="Disturbance%20%28ecology%29">ecologically disturbed</a> in the past than they are today. Hunting and trapping by humans may have severely impacted large lemurs in this region as well.

Comparisons of species counts from subfossil deposits and remnant populations in neighboring <a href="List%20of%20national%20parks%20of%20Madagascar">Special Reserves</a> has further demonstrated decreased diversity in lemur communities and contracted geographic ranges. At Ampasambazimba in central Madagascar, 20 species of subfossil lemur have been found. At nearby <a href="Ambohitantely%20Reserve">Ambohitantely Reserve</a>, only 20% of those species still survive. Only six of 13 species found at <a href="Ankilitelo">Ankilitelo</a> and <a href="Ankomaka%20Caves">Ankomaka Caves</a> in the southwest still survive at <a href="Beza%20Mahafaly%20Reserve">Beza Mahafaly Reserve</a>. In the extreme north, the caves of <a href="Ankarana">Ankarana</a> have yielded 19 species, yet only nine remain in the surrounding forests. In the northwest, 10 or 11 subfossil species have been found at <a href="Anjohibe">Anjohibe</a>, whereas only six species remain at nearby <a href="Ankarafantsika%20National%20Park">Ankarafantsika National Park</a>.

As with the extinctions that occurred on other land masses during the late Pleistocene and Holocene (known as the <a href="Quaternary%20extinction%20event">Quaternary extinction event</a>), the disappearance of Madagascar's megafauna is tightly linked with the arrival of humans, with nearly all extinctions dating to around the same time of the earliest evidence of human activity on the island or significantly later. The exact date of human arrival is unknown; a <a href="Radius%20%28bone%29">radius</a> (arm bone) of a "Palaeopropithecus ingens" with distinct cut marks from the removal of flesh with sharp objects dates to 2325 ± 43 BP (2366–2315 <a href="Radiocarbon%20dating%23Calibration">cal yr</a> BP). Based on this evidence from <a href="Taolambiby">Taolambiby</a> in the southwest interior, as well as other dates for human-modified dwarf hippo bones and introduced plant pollen from other parts of the island, the arrival of humans is conservatively estimated at 350 BCE. Measurements of <a href="Stratigraphy">stratigraphic charcoal</a> and the appearance of exotic plant pollen dated from Holocene <a href="core%20sample">core sample</a>s confirm these approximated dates for human arrival in the southwestern corner of the island and further suggest that the central and northern parts of the island did not experience significant human impact until 700 to 1,500 years later. The humid forests of the lower interior of the island were the last to be settled (as shown by the presence of charcoal particles), possibly due to the prevalence of human diseases, such as <a href="plague%20%28disease%29">plague</a>, <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, and <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>. The entire island was not fully colonized by humans until the beginning of the second millennium CE.

The extinction of Madagascar's megafauna, including the giant lemurs, was one of the most recent in history, with large lemur species like "Palaeopropithecus ingens" surviving until approximately 500 years ago and one bone of the extinct "Hippopotamus laloumena" <a href="radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon dated</a> to about 100 years BP. An even wider extinction window for the subfossil lemurs, ranging up until the 20th century, may be possible if reports of unidentified animals are true. As recently as the early 17th century, dwindling populations of subfossil lemurs may have persisted in coastal regions where tree-cutting and uncontrolled fires had less of an impact. By that date, the Central Highlands' forests were mostly gone, with the exception of scattered forest fragments and strips. Along the northwest coast, forms such as "Archaeolemur" may have survived for more than a millennium after the arrival of humans. This is supported by radiocarbon dates for "Archaeolemur" from the Ankarana Massif dating to 975 ± 50 CE as well as archaeological data that show there was little human activity in the area until a few centuries ago, with low human population density along the northwest coast until nearly 1500 CE.

In the 20th century, six hypotheses for explaining the extinction of the giant subfossil lemurs have been proposed and tested. They are known as the "Great Fire", "Great Drought", "Blitzkrieg", "Biological Invasion", "Hypervirulent Disease", and "Synergy" hypotheses. The first was proposed in 1927 when <a href="Jean-Henri%20Humbert">Henri Humbert</a> and other botanists working in Madagascar suspected that human-introduced fire and uncontrolled burning intended to create pasture and fields for crops transformed the habitats quickly across the island. In 1972, Mahé and Sourdat proposed that the arid south had become progressively drier, slowly killing off lemur fauna as the climate changed. Paul S. Martin applied his <a href="Quaternary%20extinction%20event%23Overkill%20hypothesis">overkill hypothesis</a> or "blitzkrieg" model to explain the loss of the Malagasy megafauna in 1984, predicting a rapid die-off as humans spread in a wave across the island, hunting the large species to extinction. That same year, Robert Dewar speculated that <a href="Introduced%20species">introduced</a> livestock outcompeted the endemic wildlife in a moderately fast series of multiple waves across the island. In 1997, MacPhee and Marx speculated that a rapid spread of <a href="Virulence">hypervirulent</a> disease might explain the die-offs that occurred after the appearance of humans worldwide, including Madagascar. Finally, in 1999, <a href="David%20A.%20Burney">David Burney</a> proposed that the complete set of human impacts worked together, in some cases along with natural climate change, and very slowly (i.e., on a time scale of centuries to millennia) brought about the demise of the giant subfossil lemurs and other recently extinct endemic wildlife.

Since all extinct lemurs were larger than the ones that currently survive, and the remaining large forests still support large populations of smaller lemurs, large size appears to have conveyed some distinct disadvantages. Large-bodied animals require larger habitats in order to maintain viable populations, and are most strongly impacted by <a href="Habitat%20destruction">habitat loss and fragmentation</a>. Large folivores typically have slower reproductive rates, live in smaller groups, and have low dispersal rates (vagility), making them especially vulnerable to habitat loss, hunting pressure, and possibly disease. Large, slow-moving animals are often easier to hunt and provide a larger amount of food than smaller prey. Leaf-eating, large-bodied slow climbers, and semiterrestrial seed predators and omnivores disappeared completely, suggesting an extinction pattern based on habitat use.

Since the subfossil bones of extinct lemurs have been found alongside the remains of highly arboreal living lemur species, we know that much of Madagascar had been covered in forest prior to the arrival of humans; the forest coverage of the high plateau region has been debated. Humbert and other botanists suggested that the central plateau had once been blanketed in forest, later to be destroyed by fire for use by humans. Recent paleoenvironmental studies by Burney have shown that the grasslands of that region have fluctuated over the course of millennia and were not entirely created by humans. Similarly, the role humans played in the aridification of the south and southwest has been questioned, since natural drying of the climate started before human arrival. The marshes of the region (in which subfossil remains have been found) have dried up, subfossil sites have yielded a host of arboreal lemurs, and site names, such as Ankilitelo ("place of three "kily" or <a href="Tamarind">tamarind trees</a>") suggest a recent wetter past. Pollen studies have shown that the aridification process began nearly 3,000 years ago, and peaked 1,000 years prior to the time of the extinctions. No extinctions occurred prior to the arrival of humans, and the recent climatic changes have not been as severe as those prior to human arrival, suggesting that humans and their effect on the vegetation did play a role in the extinctions. The central plateau lost more species than the dry south and southwest, suggesting that degraded habitats were more affected than arid habitats.

Over-hunting by humans has been one of the most widely accepted hypotheses for the ultimate demise of the subfossil lemurs. The extinctions and human hunting pressure are associated due to the synchronicity of human arrival and species decline, as well as the suspected naïveté of the Malagasy wildlife during the early encounters with human hunters. Despite the assumptions, evidence of butchery has been minimal until recently, although folk memories of rituals associated with the killing of megafauna have been reported. Archeological evidence for butchery of giant subfossil lemurs, including "Palaeopropithecus ingens" and "Pachylemur insignis", was found on specimens from two sites in southwestern Madagascar, Taolambiby and Tsirave. The bones had been collected in the early 20th century and lacked stratigraphic records; one of the bones with tool marks had been dated to the time of the first arrival of humans. Tool-induced bone alterations, in the form of cuts and chop marks near joints and other characteristic cuts and fractures, indicated the early human settlers skinned, disarticulated, and filleted giant lemurs. Prior to these finds, only modified bones of dwarf hippos and elephant birds, as well as giant aye-aye teeth, had been found.

Although there is evidence that habitat loss, hunting, and other factors played a role in the demise of the subfossil lemurs, prior to the synergy hypothesis, each had its own discrepancies. Humans may have hunted the giant lemurs for food, but no signs of game-dependent butchery have been found. Madagascar was colonized by Iron-age pastoralists, horticulturalists, and fishermen, not big-game hunters. The blitzkrieg hypothesis predicts extinction within 100 and 1,000 years as humans sweep across the island, yet humans lived alongside the giant lemurs for more than 1,500 years. Alternatively, habitat loss and deforestation have been argued against because many giant lemurs were thought to be terrestrial, they are missing from undisturbed forested habitats, and their environment was not fully forested prior to the arrival of humans. Anthropologist <a href="Laurie%20Godfrey">Laurie Godfrey</a> defended the effects of habitat loss by pointing out that most of the extinct lemurs have been shown to have been at least partly arboreal and dependent upon leaves and seeds for food, and also that these large-bodied specialists would be most vulnerable to habitat disturbance and fragmentation due to their low reproductive resilience and their need for large, undisturbed habitats. Still, much of the island remained covered in forest, even into the 20th century.

Linking human colonization to a specific cause for extinction has been difficult since human activities have varied from region to region. No single human activity can account for the extinction of the giant subfossil lemurs, but humans are still regarded as being primarily responsible. Each of the contributing human-caused factors played a role (having a <a href="Synergy">synergistic effect</a>) in varying degrees. The most widespread and adaptable species, such as "Archaeolemur", were able to survive despite hunting pressure and human-caused habitat change until human population growth and other factors reached a tipping point, cumulatively resulting in their extinction.

While it is generally agreed that both human and natural factors contributed to the subfossil lemur extinction, studies of sediment cores have helped to clarify the general timeline and initial sequence of events. <a href="Spore">Spore</a>s of the <a href="Coprophilous%20fungi">coprophilous fungus</a>, "<a href="Sporormiella">Sporormiella</a>", found in sediment cores experienced a dramatic decline shortly after the arrival of humans. Since this <a href="fungus">fungus</a> cannot complete its life cycle without dung from large animals, its decline also indicates a sharp decline in giant subfossil lemur populations, as well as other large herbivores, starting around 230–410 cal yr CE. Following the decline of megafauna, the presence of charcoal particles increased significantly, starting in the southwest corner of the island, gradually spreading to the other coasts and the island's interior over the next 1,000 years. The first evidence for the introduction of cattle to the island dates to 1,000 years after the initial decline of coprophilous fungal spores.

The loss of grazers and browsers might have resulted in the accumulation of excessive plant material and litter, promoting more frequent and destructive wildfires, which would explain the rise in charcoal particles following the decline in coprophilous fungus spores. This in turn resulted in ecological restructuring through the elimination of the wooded savannas and preferred arboreal habitats on which the giant subfossil lemurs depended. This left their populations at unsustainably low levels, and factors such as their slow reproduction, continued habitat degradation, increased competition with introduced species, and continued hunting (at lower levels, depending on the region) prevented them from recovering and gradually resulted in their extinction.

Hunting is thought to have caused the initial rapid decline, referred to as the primary trigger, although other explanations may be plausible. In theory, habitat loss should affect frugivores more than folivores, since leaves are more widely available. Both large-bodied frugivores and large-bodied folivores disappeared simultaneously, while smaller species remained. Other large non-primate grazers also disappeared around the same time. Consequently, large body size has been shown to have the strongest link to the extinctions—more so than activity patterns or diet. Since large animals are more attractive as prey, fungal spores associated with their dung declined rapidly with the arrival of humans, and butchery marks have been found on giant subfossil lemur remains, hunting appears to be a plausible explanation for the initial decline of the megafauna.

By region, studies have revealed specific details that have helped outline the series of events that led to the extinction of the local megafauna. In the Central Highlands, dense forests existed until 1600 CE, with lingering patches persisting until the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, small fragments stand isolated among vast expanses of human-created savanna, despite an average annual rainfall that is sufficient to sustain the evergreen forests once found there. Deliberately set fires were the cause of the deforestation, and forest regrowth is restricted by <a href="Erosion">soil erosion</a> and the presence of fire-resistant, exotic grasses. In the southeast, an extended drought dating to 950 cal yr BP led to fires and transition of open grasslands. The drought may also have pushed humans populations to rely more heavily on <a href="bushmeat">bushmeat</a>. Had humans not been present, the subfossil lemur populations might have adjusted to the new conditions and recovered. Had the drought not reduced the population of the subfossil lemurs, the pressure from the small number of people living in the region at the time might not have been enough to cause the extinctions. All of the factors that have played a role in past extinctions are still present and active today. As a result, the extinction event that claimed Madagascar's giant subfossil lemurs is still ongoing.

Recent radiocarbon dates from <a href="accelerator%20mass%20spectrometry">accelerator mass spectrometry</a> C dating, such as 630 ± 50 BP for "Megaladapis" remains and 510 ± 80 BP for "Palaeopropithecus" remains, indicate that the giant lemurs survived into modern times. It is likely that memories of these creatures persist in the <a href="oral%20tradition">oral tradition</a>s of some Malagasy cultural groups. Some recent stories from around <a href="Belo%20sur%20Mer">Belo sur Mer</a> in southwestern Madagascar might even suggest that some of the giant subfossil lemurs still survive in remote forests.

Flacourt's 1658 description of the "tretretretre" or "tratratratra" was the first mention of the now extinct giant lemurs in Western culture, but it is unclear if he saw it. The creature Flacourt described has traditionally been interpreted as a species of "Megaladapis". The size may have been exaggerated, and the "round head and a human face" would not match "Megaladapis", which had an enlarged snout and the least forward-facing eyes of all primates. The facial description, and the mention of a short tail, solitary habits, and other traits better match the most recent interpretation — "Palaeopropithecus". Malagasy tales recorded by the 19th-century folklorist <a href="Gabriel%20Ferrand">Gabriel Ferrand</a> describing a large animal with a flat human-like face that was unable to negotiate smooth rock outcrops also best match "Palaeopropithecus", which would also have had difficulty on flat smooth surfaces.

In 1995, a research team led by David Burney and <a href="Ramilisonina">Ramilisonina</a> performed interviews in and around Belo sur Mer, including Ambararata and Antsira, to find subfossil megafaunal sites used early in the century by other paleontologists. During carefully controlled interviews, the team recorded stories of recent sightings of dwarf hippos (called "kilopilopitsofy") and of a large lemur-like creature known as "kidoky"; a report of the interviews was published in 1998 with encouragement from primatologist <a href="Alison%20Jolly">Alison Jolly</a> and anthropologist Laurie Godfrey. In one interview, an 85-year-old man named Jean Noelson Pascou recounted seeing the rare "kidoky" up close in 1952. Pascou said that the animal looks similar to a sifaka, but had a human-like face, and was "the size of a seven-year-old girl". It had dark fur and a discernible white spot both on the forehead and below the mouth. According to Pascou, it was a shy animal that fled on the ground instead of in the trees. Burney interpreted the old man as saying that it moved in "a series of leaps", but Godfrey later claimed that "a series of bounds" was a better translation — a description that would closely match the foot anatomy of monkey lemurs, such as "Hadropithecus" and "Archaeolemur". Pascou could also imitate its call, a long single "whoop", and said that "kidoky" would come closer and continue calling if he imitated the call correctly. The call Pascou imitated was comparable to that of a short call for an indri, which lives on the other side of Madagascar. When shown a picture of an indri, Pascou said "kidoky" did not look like that, and that it had a rounder face, more similar to a sifaka. Pascou also speculated that "kidoky" could stand on two legs and that it was a solitary animal.

Another interviewee, François, a middle-aged woodcutter who spent time in the forests inland (east) from the main road between <a href="Morondava">Morondava</a> and Belo sur Mer, and five of his friends, reported seeing "kidoky" recently. Their description of the animal and François's imitation of its long call were virtually identical to Pascou's. One of the young men insisted that its fur had a lot of white in it, but the other men could not confirm that. François and his friends reported that it had never climbed a tree in their presence, and that it flees on the ground in short leaps or bounds. When Burney imitated the sideways leaping of a sifaka moving on the ground, one of the men corrected him, pointing out that he was imitating a sifaka. The man's imitation of the gallop "kidoky" used was very <a href="baboon">baboon</a>-like. The men also reported that imitating its call can draw the animal closer and cause it to continue calling.

Burney and Ramilisonina admitted that the most parsimonious explanation for the sightings was that "kidoky" was a misidentified sifaka or other larger living lemur species. The authors did not feel comfortable with such a dismissal because of their careful quizzing and use of unlabeled color plates during the interviews and because of the competence demonstrated by the interviewees in regards to local wildlife and lemur habits. The possibility of a wild introduced baboon surviving in the forests could not be dismissed. The descriptions of "kidoky", with its terrestrial baboon-like gait, make "Hadropithecus" and "Archaeolemur" the most plausible candidates among the giant subfossil lemurs. At the very least, the stories support a wider extinction window for the giant subfossil lemurs, suggesting that their extinction was recent enough for such vivid stories to survive in the oral traditions of the Malagasy people.

The Temple at Thatch

The Temple at Thatch was an unpublished novel by the British author <a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a>, his first adult attempt at full-length fiction. He began writing it in 1924 at the end of his final year as an undergraduate at <a href="Hertford%20College%2C%20Oxford">Hertford College, Oxford</a>, and continued to work on it intermittently in the following 12 months. After his friend <a href="Harold%20Acton">Harold Acton</a> commented unfavourably on the draft in June 1925, Waugh burned the manuscript. In a fit of despondency from this and other personal disappointments he began a suicide attempt before experiencing what he termed "a sharp return to good sense".

In the absence of a manuscript or printed text, most information on the novel's subject comes from Waugh's diary entries and later reminiscences. The story was evidently semi-autobiographical, based on Waugh's Oxford experiences. The protagonist was an undergraduate and the work's main themes were madness and <a href="black%20magic">black magic</a>. Some of the novel's ideas may have been incorporated into Waugh's first commercially published work of fiction, his 1925 short story "The Balance", which includes several references to a country house called "Thatch" and is partly structured as a film script, as apparently was the lost novel. "The Balance" contains characters, perhaps carried over from "The Temple at Thatch", who appear by name in Waugh's later fiction.

Acton's severe judgement did not deter Waugh from his intention to be a writer, but it affected his belief that he could succeed as a novelist. For a time he turned his attention away from fiction, but with the gradual recovery of his self-confidence he was able to complete his <a href="debut%20novel">first novel</a>, "<a href="Decline%20and%20Fall">Decline and Fall</a>", which was published with great success in 1928.

Evelyn Waugh's literary pedigree was strong. His father, the publisher <a href="Arthur%20Waugh">Arthur Waugh</a> (1866–1943), was a respected literary critic for "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>"; his elder brother <a href="Alec%20Waugh">Alec</a> (1899–1981) was a successful novelist whose first book "<a href="The%20Loom%20of%20Youth">The Loom of Youth</a>" became a controversial best seller in 1917. Evelyn wrote his first extant story "The Curse of the Horse Race" in 1910, when he was seven years old. In the years before the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> he helped to edit and produce a handwritten publication called "The Pistol Troop Magazine", and also wrote poems. Later, as a schoolboy at <a href="Lancing%20College">Lancing College</a>, he wrote a parody of <a href="Katherine%20Mansfield">Katherine Mansfield</a>'s style, entitled "The Twilight of Language". He also tried to write a novel, but soon gave this up to concentrate on a school-themed play, "Conversion", which was performed before the school in the summer of 1921.

At Hertford College, Oxford, where Waugh arrived in January 1922 to study history, he became part of a circle that included a number of future writers and critics of eminence—<a href="Harold%20Acton">Harold Acton</a>, <a href="Christopher%20Hollis">Christopher Hollis</a>, <a href="Anthony%20Powell">Anthony Powell</a> and <a href="Cyril%20Connolly">Cyril Connolly</a>, among others. He also formed close personal friendships with aristocratic and near-aristocratic contemporaries such as <a href="Hugh%20Patrick%20Lygon">Hugh Lygon</a> and Alastair Graham, either of whom may have been models for <a href="Sebastian%20Flyte">Sebastian Flyte</a> in Waugh's later novel "<a href="Brideshead%20Revisited">Brideshead Revisited</a>". From such companions Waugh acquired the fascination with the aristocracy and country houses that would embellish much of his fiction. At Oxford Waugh did little work and dedicated himself largely to social pleasures: "The record of my life there is essentially a catalogue of friendships". However, he developed a reputation as a skilful graphic artist, and contributed articles, reviews and short stories to both the main university magazines, "<a href="The%20Isis%20Magazine">Isis</a>" and "<a href="Cherwell%20%28newspaper%29">Cherwell</a>".

One of the "Isis" stories, "Unacademic Exercise: A Nature Story", describes the performance of a magical ceremony by which an undergraduate is transformed by his fellows into a <a href="werewolf">werewolf</a>. Waugh's interest in the occult is further demonstrated by his involvement, in the summer of 1924, in an amateur film entitled "666", in which he certainly appeared and which he may have written. He appears to have been in a state of some mental confusion or turmoil; the writer Simon Whitechapel cites a letter from Waugh to a friend, written at this time: "I have been living very intensely the last three weeks. For the past fortnight I have been nearly insane. I am a little saner now." However, most scholars take this as a referring to Waugh's <a href="homosexuality">homosexuality</a> rather than <a href="black%20magic">black magic</a>.

The earliest record of Waugh's intention to attempt a novel appears in a letter dated May 1924, to his schoolfriend <a href="Dudley%20Carew">Dudley Carew</a>. Waugh writes: "Quite soon I am going to write a little book. It is going to be called "The Temple at Thatch" and will be all about magic and madness". This writing project may have been a reaction to Waugh's immediate circumstances; he was in the last weeks of his Oxford career, contemplating failure in his examinations and irritated by the fact that most of his contemporaries appeared to be on the verge of brilliant careers. On 22 June 1924 he spent time working out the plot, a continuation of the supernatural theme explored in "Unacademic Exercise". The basic premise was an undergraduate inheriting a country house of which nothing was left except an 18th-century <a href="folly">folly</a>, where he set up house and practised black magic.

Waugh's diary indicates that he began writing the story on 21 July, when he completed a dozen pages of the first chapter; he thought it was "quite good". He appears to have done no more work on the project until early September, when he confides to his diary that it is "in serious danger of becoming dull", and expresses doubts that it will ever be finished. However, Waugh apparently found fresh inspiration after reading "A Cypress Grove", an essay by the 17th-century Scots poet <a href="William%20Drummond%20of%20Hawthornden">William Drummond of Hawthornden</a>, and considered retitling his story "The Fabulous Paladins" after a passage in the essay.
The autumn of 1924 was spent largely in the pursuit of pleasure until, shortly before Christmas, the pressing need to earn money led Waugh to apply for teaching jobs in private schools. His diary entry for 17 December 1924 records: "Still writing out letters in praise of myself to obscure private schools, and still attempting to rewrite "The Temple"". He eventually secured a job as assistant master at Arnold House Preparatory School in <a href="Denbighshire">Denbighshire</a>, North Wales, at a salary of £160 a year, and left London on 22 January to take up his post, carrying with him the manuscript of "The Temple".

During his first term at Arnold House Waugh found few opportunities to continue his writing. He was tired by the end of the day, his interest in "The Temple" flagged, and from time to time his attention wandered to other subjects; he contemplated a book on <a href="Silenus">Silenus</a>, but he admitted that it "may or may not ... be written". After the Easter holidays he felt more positively about "The Temple": "I am making the first chapter a cinema film, and have been writing furiously ever since. I honestly think that it is going to be rather good". He sometimes worked on the book during classes, telling any boys who dared to ask what he was doing that he was writing a history of the Eskimos. By June he felt confident enough to send the first few chapters to his Oxford friend Harold Acton, "asking for criticism and hoping for praise". Earlier that year Waugh had commented warmly on Acton's book of poems, "An Indian Ass", "which brought back memories of a life [at Oxford] infinitely remote".

While waiting for Acton's reply, Waugh heard that his brother Alec had arranged a job for him based in <a href="Pisa">Pisa</a>, Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer <a href="Charles%20Kenneth%20Scott%20Moncrieff">Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff</a> who was working on the first English translation of <a href="Marcel%20Proust">Marcel Proust</a>'s <a href="novel%20sequence">novel sequence</a> "<a href="%C3%80%20la%20recherche%20du%20temps%20perdu">À la recherche du temps perdu</a>". Waugh promptly resigned his position at Arnold House, in anticipation of "a year abroad drinking Chianti under olive trees." Then came Acton's "polite but chilling" response to "The Temple at Thatch". This letter has not survived; its wording was recalled by Waugh 40 years later, in his biography "A Little Learning". Acton wrote that the story was "too English for my exotic taste ... too much nid-nodding over port." He recommended, facetiously, that the book be printed "in a few elegant copies for the friends who love you", and gave a list of the least elegant of their mutual acquaintances. Many years later Acton wrote of the story: "It was an airy Firbankian trifle, totally unworthy of Evelyn, and I brutally told him so. It was a misfired "jeu d'esprit".

Waugh did not query his friend's judgement, but took his manuscript to the school's furnaces and unceremoniously burnt it. Immediately afterwards he received the news that the job with Scott Moncrieff had fallen through. The double blow affected Waugh severely; he wrote in his diary in July: "The phrase 'the end of the tether' besets me with unshakeable persistence". In his biography Waugh writes: "I went down alone to the beach with my thoughts full of death. I took off my clothes and began swimming out to sea. Did I really intend to drown myself? That was certainly in my mind". He left a note with his clothes, a quotation from <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a> about the sea washing away all human ills. A short way out, after being stung by <a href="jellyfish">jellyfish</a>, he abandoned the attempt, turned round and swam back to the shore. He did not, however, withdraw his resignation from the school, returning instead to London.

Although he had destroyed his novel, Waugh still intended to be a writer, and in the late summer of 1925 completed a short story, called "The Balance". This became his first commercially published work when <a href="Chapman%20and%20Hall">Chapman and Hall</a>, where his father was managing director, included it in a short stories collection the following year. "The Balance" has no magical themes, but in other respects has clear references to "The Temple at Thatch". Both works have Oxford settings, and the short story is written in the film script format that Waugh devised for the first chapter of the novel.

There are several references in "The Balance" to a country house called "Thatch", though this is a fully functioning establishment in the manner of Brideshead rather than a ruined folly. Imogen Quest, the protagonist Adam's girlfriend, lives at Thatch; a watercolour of the house is displayed in Adam's undergraduate's rooms; the end of the story describes a house party at Thatch, during which the guests gossip maliciously about Adam. The names "Imogen Quest" and "Adam" were used by Waugh several years later in his novel "<a href="Vile%20Bodies">Vile Bodies</a>", leading to speculation as to whether these names, like that of the house, originated in "The Temple at Thatch".

Acton's dismissal of "The Temple at Thatch" had made Waugh nervous of his potential as an imaginative writer—he deferred to Acton's judgement on all literary issues—and he did not for the time being attempt to write another novel. After "The Balance" he wrote a humorous article, "Noah, or the Future of Intoxication", which was first accepted and then rejected by the publishers Kegan Paul. However, a short story called "A House of Gentle Folks", was published in "The New Decameron: The Fifth Day", edited by Hugh Chesterman (Oxford: Basil. Blackwell, 1927). Thereafter, for a time, Waugh devoted himself to non-fictional work. An essay on the <a href="Pre-Raphaelites">Pre-Raphaelites</a> was published in a limited edition by Waugh's friend Alastair Graham; this led to the production of a full-length book, "Rossetti, His Life and Works", published in 1928.

The desire to write fiction persisted, however, and in the autumn of 1927 Waugh began a comic novel which he entitled "Picaresque: or the Making of an Englishman". The first pages were read to another friend, the future novelist <a href="Anthony%20Powell">Anthony Powell</a>, who found them very amusing, and was surprised when Waugh told him, just before Christmas, that the manuscript had been burned. This was not in fact the case; Waugh had merely put the work aside. Early in 1928 he wrote to Harold Acton, asking whether or not he should finish it. On this occasion Acton was full of praise; Waugh resumed work, and completed the novel by April 1928. It was published later that year under a new title, "Decline and Fall".

According to his recent biographer <a href="Paula%20Byrne">Paula Byrne</a>, Waugh had "found his vocation as a writer, and over the next few years his career would rise spectacularly." "The Temple of Thatch" was quickly forgotten, and as Whitechapel points out, has failed to arouse much subsequent interest from scholars. Whitechapel, however, considers it a loss to literature, and adds: "Whether or not it matched the quality of his second novel, "Decline and Fall", if it were still extant it could not fail to be of interest to both scholars and general readers."

Oppenheimer security hearing

The Oppenheimer security hearing was a 1954 proceeding by the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">United States Atomic Energy Commission</a> (AEC) that explored the background, actions, and associations of <a href="J.%20Robert%20Oppenheimer">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>, the American scientist who had headed the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, where he played a key part in the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> that developed the <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>. The hearing resulted in Oppenheimer's <a href="Q%20clearance">Q clearance</a> being revoked. This marked the end of his formal relationship with the government of the United States, and generated considerable controversy regarding whether the treatment of Oppenheimer was fair, or whether it was an expression of anti-Communist <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>.

Doubts about Oppenheimer's loyalty dated back to the 1930s, when he was a member of numerous <a href="Communist%20front">Communist front</a> organizations, and was associated with <a href="Communist%20Party%20USA">Communist Party USA</a> members, including his wife and his brother. These associations were known to Army Counter-intelligence at the time he was made director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1942, and chairman of the influential General Advisory Committee of the AEC in 1947. In this capacity Oppenheimer became involved in bureaucratic conflict between the Army and Air Force over the types of nuclear weapons the country required, technical conflict between the scientists over the feasibility of the <a href="hydrogen%20bomb">hydrogen bomb</a>, and personal conflict with AEC commissioner <a href="Lewis%20Strauss">Lewis Strauss</a>.

The proceedings were initiated after Oppenheimer refused to voluntarily give up his security clearance while working as an atomic weapons consultant for the government, under a contract due to expire at the end of June 1954. Several of his colleagues testified at the hearings. As a result of the two to one decision of the hearing's three judges, he was stripped of his security clearance one day before his consultant contract was due to expire. The panel found that he was loyal and discreet with atomic secrets, but did not recommend that his security clearance be reinstated.

The loss of his security clearance ended Oppenheimer's role in government and policy. He became an academic exile, cut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create. The reputations of those who had testified against Oppenheimer were tarnished as well, and Oppenheimer's reputation was later partly rehabilitated by Presidents <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> and <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>. The brief period when scientists were hailed as heroes uniquely qualified to comment on public policy was ended, and scientists working within the government were on notice that <a href="dissent">dissent</a> was no longer tolerated.

Before <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, <a href="J.%20Robert%20Oppenheimer">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a> had been professor of physics at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>. The scion of a wealthy New York family, he was a graduate of <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>, and had studied in Europe at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> in England, the <a href="University%20of%20G%C3%B6ttingen">University of Göttingen</a> in Germany (where he had earned his doctorate in physics under the supervision of <a href="Max%20Born">Max Born</a> at the age of 23), and the <a href="University%20of%20Leiden">University of Leiden</a> in the Netherlands. As one of the few American physicists with a deep understanding of the new field of <a href="Quantum%20Mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, he was hired by the University of California in 1929.

As a theoretical physicist, Oppenheimer had considerable achievements. In a 1930 paper on the <a href="Dirac%20equation">Dirac equation</a>, he had predicted the existence of the <a href="positron">positron</a>. A 1938 paper co-written with <a href="Robert%20Serber">Robert Serber</a> explored the properties of <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a> stars. This was followed by one co-written with one of his students, <a href="George%20Volkoff">George Volkoff</a>, in which they demonstrated that there was a limit, the so-called <a href="Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff%20limit">Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit</a>, to the <a href="mass">mass</a> of stars beyond which they would not remain stable as <a href="neutron%20stars">neutron stars</a> and would undergo gravitational collapse. In 1939, with another of his students, <a href="Hartland%20Snyder">Hartland Snyder</a>, he went further and predicted the existence of what are today known as <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>s. It would be decades before the significance of this was appreciated.

Still, Oppenheimer was not well known before the war, and certainly not as renowned as his friend and colleague <a href="Ernest%20O.%20Lawrence">Ernest O. Lawrence</a>, who was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 1939 for his invention of the <a href="cyclotron">cyclotron</a>. But as an experimental physicist, Lawrence had come to rely on Oppenheimer, and it was Lawrence who brought Oppenheimer into the effort to develop an <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>, which became known as the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>. <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves%2C%20Jr.">Leslie R. Groves, Jr.</a>, who became director of the Manhattan Project on September 8, 1942, met Oppenheimer at Berkeley, where Oppenheimer briefed Groves on his work on the "<a href="History%20of%20the%20Teller%E2%80%93Ulam%20design">Super</a>" (thermonuclear) bomb. Oppenheimer told Groves on October 8 that the Manhattan Project needed a dedicated weapons development laboratory. Groves agreed, and after a second meeting with Oppenheimer on a train on October 15, decided that Oppenheimer was the man he needed to head what became the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a>, despite Oppenheimer's lack of a Nobel Prize or administrative experience.

The end of the war in the wake of the <a href="atomic%20bombing%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> made scientists into heroes. Oppenheimer became a celebrity, with his face gracing front pages of newspapers and the covers of magazines. "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine described him as "one of the most famous men in the world, one of the most admired, quoted, photographed, consulted, glorified, well-nigh deified as the fabulous and fascinating archetype of a brand new kind of hero, the hero of science and intellect, originator and living symbol of the new atomic age."

Many of Oppenheimer's associates in the years before World War II were <a href="Communist%20Party%20USA">Communist Party USA</a> members. They included his wife Kitty, whose first husband Joe Dallet had been killed fighting with the <a href="Lincoln%20Battalion">Lincoln Battalion</a> in the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>; his brother <a href="Frank%20Oppenheimer">Frank Oppenheimer</a> and Frank's wife Jackie; and his girlfriend <a href="Jean%20Tatlock">Jean Tatlock</a>. One of his Communist associates was a colleague at the University of California, an <a href="assistant%20professor">assistant professor</a> of French literature named <a href="Haakon%20Chevalier">Haakon Chevalier</a>. The two had met during a rally for <a href="Spanish%20Loyalists">Spanish Loyalists</a>, and had co-founded a branch of the <a href="American%20Federation%20of%20Teachers">American Federation of Teachers</a> at Berkeley known as Local 349. The <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) had opened a file on Oppenheimer in March 1941, after he had attended a December 1940 meeting at Chevalier's home that was also attended by the Communist Party's California state secretary William Schneiderman and its treasurer <a href="Isaac%20Folkoff">Isaac Folkoff</a>, both of whom were targets of FBI surveillance and wiretaps. Agents had recorded the license plate of Oppenheimer's car. The FBI noted that Oppenheimer was on the Executive Committee of the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, which it considered a <a href="Communist%20front">Communist front</a>. Shortly thereafter, the FBI added Oppenheimer to its <a href="Custodial%20Detention%20Index">Custodial Detention Index</a>, for arrest in case of national emergency.
In January or February 1943, Chevalier had a brief conversation with Oppenheimer in the kitchen of his home. Chevalier told Oppenheimer that there was a scientist, George Eltenton, who could transmit information of a technical nature to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Oppenheimer rejected the overture, but failed to report it until August 1943, when he volunteered to Manhattan Project security officers that three men at Berkeley had been solicited for nuclear secrets on behalf of the Soviet Union, by a person he did not know who worked for <a href="Shell%20Oil">Shell Oil</a>, and who had <a href="Communist">Communist</a> connections. He gave that person's name as George Eltenton. When pressed on the issue in later interviews at Los Alamos in December 1943 with Groves, who promised to keep the identity of the three men from the FBI, Oppenheimer identified the contact who had approached him as Chevalier, and told Groves that only one person had been approached: his brother Frank. Groves considered Oppenheimer too important to the ultimate Allied goals of building atomic bombs and winning the war to oust him over this suspicious behavior. He ordered that Oppenheimer be given a security clearance "without delay, irrespective of the information which you have concerning Mr. Oppenheimer. He is absolutely essential to the project."

Oppenheimer was interviewed by the FBI on September 5, 1946. He related the "Chevalier incident", and he gave contradictory and equivocating statements, telling government agents that only he had been approached, by Chevalier, who at the time had supposedly said that he had a potential conduit through Eltenton for information which could be passed to the Soviets. Oppenheimer claimed to have invented the other contacts to conceal the identity of Chevalier, whose identity he believed would be immediately apparent if he named only one contact, but whom he believed to be innocent of any disloyalty. The 1943 fabrication and the shifting nature of his accounts figured prominently in the 1954 inquiry.

The <a href="McMahon%20Act">McMahon Act</a> that established the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> (AEC) required all employees holding wartime security clearances issued by the Manhattan Project to be investigated by the <a href="FBI">FBI</a> and re-certified. This provision had come in the wake of the February 16, 1946, defection of <a href="Igor%20Gouzenko">Igor Gouzenko</a> in Canada, and the subsequent arrest of 22 people. President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> appointed Oppenheimer to the AEC General Advisory Committee (GAC) on December 10, 1946, so the FBI interviewed two dozen of Oppenheimer's associates, including <a href="Robert%20Bacher">Robert Bacher</a>, Ernest Lawrence, <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> and <a href="Robert%20Gordon%20Sproul">Robert Gordon Sproul</a>. Groves and the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="Robert%20P.%20Patterson">Robert P. Patterson</a> supplied written statements supporting Oppenheimer. AEC chairman <a href="David%20Lilienthal">David Lilienthal</a> and <a href="Vannevar%20Bush">Vannevar Bush</a> discussed the matter with Truman's sympathetic aide <a href="Clark%20Clifford">Clark Clifford</a> at the White House. They found <a href="John%20Lansdale%2C%20Jr.">John Lansdale, Jr.</a> particularly persuasive; he had interrogated Oppenheimer over the Chevalier incident in 1943, and strongly supported him. On August 11, 1947, they unanimously voted to grant Oppenheimer a <a href="Q%20clearance">Q clearance</a>. At the first meeting of the GAC on January 3, 1947, Oppenheimer was unanimously elected its chairman.

The FBI was willing to furnish Oppenheimer's political enemies with incriminating evidence about Communist ties. These included <a href="Lewis%20Strauss">Lewis Strauss</a>, an AEC commissioner who resented Oppenheimer for his humiliation before Congress regarding opposition to the export of radioactive isotopes to other nations, which Strauss believed had military applications. As GAC chairman, Oppenheimer was called before the <a href="United%20States%20Congress%20Joint%20Committee%20on%20Atomic%20Energy">Joint Committee on Atomic Energy</a> (JCAE) over the issue in June 1949. The other four AEC commissioners had opposed Strauss, so he had gone to the JCAE in an attempt to get the decision overturned. The result was a stunning humiliation for the thin-skinned Strauss. Oppenheimer testified that: 

This came on the heels of controversies about whether some of Oppenheimer's students, including <a href="David%20Bohm">David Bohm</a>, <a href="Ross%20Lomanitz">Ross Lomanitz</a> and Bernard Peters, had been Communists at the time they had worked with him at Berkeley. Oppenheimer was called to testify in front of the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a>, where he admitted that he had associations with the Communist Party in the 1930s, and named some of his students as being Communists or closely associated with them. Bohm and Peters eventually left the country, while Lomanitz was forced to work as a laborer. Frank Oppenheimer was fired from his university position, and could not find work in physics for a decade. He and his wife Jackie became cattle ranchers in <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>. Their reputations were rehabilitated in 1959, and they founded the San Francisco <a href="Exploratorium">Exploratorium</a> in 1969.

<a href="David%20Kaiser">David Kaiser</a> noted that:

From 1949 to 1953, Oppenheimer had also found himself in the middle of a controversy over the development of the "Super". In 1949, the Soviet Union detonated an atomic bomb. This came as a shock to many Americans, and it fell to Oppenheimer to check the evidence and confirm that the explosion had taken place. In response, Strauss recommended that the United States retain nuclear superiority by developing the "Super". This had been under consideration at Los Alamos for several years. Brigadier General <a href="James%20McCormack">James McCormack</a> told the AEC commissioners that while thermonuclear weapons could potentially be thousands of times as powerful as fission weapons, as of 1949 there was no design that worked, and no certainty that a practical bomb could be built if there was one. He cautioned that the "Super" would probably require large amounts of <a href="tritium">tritium</a>, which could only be acquired by diverting the AEC's <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>s from <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a> production.

Strauss found allies in Lawrence and <a href="Edward%20Teller">Edward Teller</a>, who had headed the "Super" group at Los Alamos during the war. When the matter was referred to the GAC, it unanimously voted against a crash program to develop the "Super". Without a workable design, it seemed foolish to divert resources from atomic bombs. Nor was there an obvious military need. Despite this, Truman authorized the crash program on January 31, 1950. Teller, Fermi, <a href="John%20von%20Neumann">John von Neumann</a>, and <a href="Stan%20Ulam">Stan Ulam</a> struggled to find a working design, and in February 1951, Ulam and Teller finally <a href="History%20of%20the%20Teller%E2%80%93Ulam%20design">devised one</a>. After reviewing the design and data gathered by the <a href="Operation%20Greenhouse">Operation Greenhouse</a> tests in May 1951, Oppenheimer's attitude completely changed, and he became convinced that the "New Super" was practical. Teller left Los Alamos to help found, with Lawrence, a second weapons laboratory, the <a href="Lawrence%20Livermore%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>, in 1952.

Thermonuclear "strategic weapons" (military targets and city-destroyers) delivered by long-range jet bombers would necessarily be under control of the relatively new <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a>. By contrast, Oppenheimer pushed for smaller "tactical" nuclear weapons which would be more useful in a limited theater against enemy troops, and which would be under control of the Army. These two branches of the service fought for control of nuclear weapons, often allied with different political parties. The Air Force, with Teller pushing its program, gained ascendency in the Republican-controlled government, after the election of <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> as president in 1952.

In November 1953, J. Edgar Hoover was sent a letter concerning Oppenheimer by William Liscum Borden, former executive director of Congress' Joint Atomic Energy Committee. In the letter, Borden stated his opinion "based upon years of study, of the available classified evidence, that more probably than not J. Robert Oppenheimer is an agent of the Soviet Union." The letter was based upon the government's massive investigative dossier on Oppenheimer, which had included "eleven years' minute surveillance of the scientist's life." His office and home had been bugged, his telephone tapped and his mail opened.

Borden's letter stated as follows:

The letter also pointed out that Oppenheimer had worked against development of the hydrogen bomb, and had worked against postwar atomic energy development, including nuclear power plants and nuclear submarines. The letter concluded:

The contents of the letter were not new, and some had been known when Oppenheimer was first cleared for atomic war work. Yet that information had not prompted anyone to seek his removal from government service. Despite the lack of new evidence, Eisenhower ordered that a "blank wall" be placed between Oppenheimer and the nation's atomic secrets.

On December 21, 1953, Oppenheimer was told by Lewis Strauss that his security file had been subject to two recent re-evaluations because of new screening criteria, and because a former government official had drawn attention to Oppenheimer's record. Strauss said that his clearance had been suspended, pending resolution of a series of charges outlined in a letter, and discussed his resigning. Given only a day to decide, and after consulting with his lawyers, Oppenheimer chose not to resign, and requested a hearing instead. The charges were outlined in a letter from <a href="Kenneth%20D.%20Nichols">Kenneth D. Nichols</a>, general manager of the AEC. Pending resolution of the charges, Oppenheimer's security clearance was suspended. Oppenheimer told Strauss that some of what was in Nichols' letter was correct, some incorrect.
The hearing was held at a temporary building near the Washington Monument housing offices of the AEC. It began on April 12, 1954, and lasted four weeks. The AEC was represented by <a href="Roger%20Robb">Roger Robb</a>, an experienced prosecutor in Washington, and Arthur Rolander, while Oppenheimer's legal team was headed by <a href="Lloyd%20K.%20Garrison">Lloyd K. Garrison</a>, a prominent New York attorney. The chairman of the Personnel Security Board was <a href="Gordon%20Gray%20%28politician%29">Gordon Gray</a>, president of the <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina">University of North Carolina</a>. The other members of the hearing panel were Thomas Alfred Morgan, a retired industrialist, and <a href="Ward%20V.%20Evans">Ward V. Evans</a>, chairman of the chemistry department at <a href="Northwestern%20University">Northwestern University</a>.

The hearing was not open to the public and initially was not publicized. At the commencement of the hearing, Gray stated the hearing was "strictly confidential", and pledged that no information related to the hearing would be released. Contrary to this assurance, a few weeks after the conclusion of the hearing a verbatim transcript of the hearing was released by the AEC. Oppenheimer and Garrison also breached the confidentiality of the hearing, by communicating with "New York Times" journalist <a href="James%20Reston">James Reston</a>, who wrote an article on the hearing that appeared on the second day of the hearing.

Garrison applied for an emergency security clearance prior to the hearing, as one had been granted to Robb, but no clearance was granted during the course of the hearing, which meant that Oppenheimer's attorneys had no access to the secrets that Robb was able to see. On at least three occasions, Garrison and his co-counsel were barred from the hearing room for security reasons, leaving Oppenheimer unrepresented, in violation of AEC regulations. During the course of the hearing, Robb repeatedly cross-examined Oppenheimer's witnesses utilizing top-secret documents unavailable to Oppenheimer's lawyers. He often read aloud from those documents, despite their secret status.

The AEC's former general counsel Joseph Volpe had urged Oppenheimer to retain a tough litigator as his attorney; Garrison's demeanor was gentle and cordial, but Robb was adversarial. Garrison voluntarily provided the board and Robb with a list of his witnesses, but Robb refused to extend the same courtesy. This gave Robb a clear advantage in his cross-examination of Oppenheimer's witnesses. One observer commented that Robb "did not treat Oppenheimer as a witness in his own case, but as a person charged with high treason."

Members of the hearing panel met with Robb prior to the hearing to review the contents of Oppenheimer's FBI file. The 1946 <a href="Administrative%20Procedure%20Act%20%28United%20States%29">Administrative Procedure Act</a> included a legal principle known as "the exclusivity of the record" or the "<a href="blank%20pad%20rule">blank pad rule</a>". This meant that a hearing could only consider information that had been formally presented under the established rules of evidence. However, while the act applied to the courts and to administrative hearings held by agencies like the <a href="Federal%20Trade%20Commission">Federal Trade Commission</a> and <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a>, it did not apply to the AEC. Garrison asked for the opportunity to review the file with the panel, but this was rejected.

As outlined in the 3,500-word Nichols letter, the hearing focused on 24 allegations, 23 of which dealt with Oppenheimer's Communist and left-wing affiliations between 1938 and 1946, including his delayed and false reporting of the Chevalier incident to authorities. The twenty-fourth charge related to his opposition to the hydrogen bomb. By including the hydrogen bomb, the AEC changed the character of the hearing, by opening up an inquiry into his activities as a postwar government adviser.
Oppenheimer testified for a total of 27 hours. His demeanor was far different than it had been in his previous interrogations, such as his appearance before the House Un-American Activities. Under cross-examination by Robb, who had access to top-secret information such as surveillance recordings, Oppenheimer was "often anguished, sometimes surprisingly inarticulate, frequently apologetic about his past and even self-castigating."

One of the key elements in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before, and he was surprised on the witness stand with transcripts that he had no chance to review. Under questioning by Robb, he admitted that he had lied to <a href="Boris%20Pash">Boris Pash</a>, an Army counterintelligence officer, concerning the approach from Chevalier. Asked why he had fabricated a story that three people had been approached for espionage, Oppenheimer responded, "Because I was an idiot."

Much of the questioning of Oppenheimer concerned his role in the hiring for Los Alamos of his former students Ross Lomanitz and Joseph Weinberg, both members of the Communist Party. The questions probed into Oppenheimer's private life, including his affair with Jean Tatlock, a Communist with whom he stayed the night while he was married. Lansdale had concluded at the time that his interest in Tatlock was romantic rather than political. Nonetheless, this innocuous affair may have played more heavily in the minds of the review panel.

Groves, testifying as a witness for the AEC and against Oppenheimer, reaffirmed his decision to hire Oppenheimer. Groves said that Oppenheimer's refusal to report Chevalier was "the typical American school boy attitude that there is something wicked about telling on a friend." Under questioning from Robb, Groves said that under the security criteria in effect in 1954, he "would not clear Dr. Oppenheimer today."

The official position of the Air Force was to support the suspension of the security clearance, which was given during testimony by its chief scientist, <a href="David%20T.%20Griggs">David T. Griggs</a>. Although his testimony was not pivotal in the decision, many physicists viewed Griggs as the "Judas who had betrayed their god", the brilliant theoretical physicist who led the successful wartime development of the atomic bomb.

Many top scientists, as well as government and military figures, testified on Oppenheimer's behalf. Among them were Fermi, <a href="Isidor%20Isaac%20Rabi">Isidor Isaac Rabi</a>, <a href="Hans%20Bethe">Hans Bethe</a>, <a href="John%20J.%20McCloy">John J. McCloy</a>, <a href="James%20B.%20Conant">James B. Conant</a> and Bush, as well as two former AEC chairmen and three former commissioners. Also testifying on behalf of Oppenheimer was Lansdale, who was involved in the Army's surveillance and investigation of Oppenheimer during the war. Lansdale, a lawyer, was not intimidated by Robb. He testified that Oppenheimer was not a Communist, and that he was "loyal and discreet".

<a href="Ernest%20Lawrence">Ernest Lawrence</a> was known to dislike political activities, seeing them as a waste of time better spent on scientific research. He did not oppose the investigations of Oppenheimer or others, tending to distance himself from those under investigation rather than supporting them. He said he was unable to testify at the Oppenheimer hearing because of illness. On April 26, Lawrence suffered a severe colitis attack. The next day, Lawrence called Lewis Strauss and told him that his brother, a doctor, had ordered him to return home and that he would not be testifying. Lawrence suffered with colitis until his death during colostomy surgery, on August 27, 1958. However, an interview transcript in which Lawrence stated that Oppenheimer "should never again have anything to do with the forming of policy" was presented at the hearing, and several other members of Lawrence's Radiation laboratory did testify against Oppenheimer in person. This resulted in later ill-feeling from the scientific community towards Lawrence and other members of his laboratory.

Edward Teller was opposed to the hearing, feeling it was improper to subject Oppenheimer to a security trial, but was torn by longstanding grievances against him. He was called by Robb to testify against Oppenheimer, and shortly before he appeared Robb showed Teller a dossier of items unfavorable to Oppenheimer. Teller testified that he considered Oppenheimer loyal, but that "in a great number of cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act – I understand that Dr. Oppenheimer acted – in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand. I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated. To this extent I feel that I would like to see the vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more." Asked whether Oppenheimer should be granted a security clearance, Teller said that "if it is a question of wisdom or judgement, as demonstrated by actions since 1945, then I would say one would be wiser not to grant clearance." This led to outrage by many in the scientific community and Teller's ostracism and virtual expulsion from academic science.

Oppenheimer's clearance was revoked by a 2–1 vote of the panel. Gray and Morgan voted in favor, Evans against. The board rendered its decision on May 27, 1954, in a 15,000-word letter to Nichols. It found that 20 of the 24 charges were either true or substantially true. The board found that while he had been opposed to the bomb and that his lack of enthusiasm for it had affected the attitude of other scientists, he had not actively discouraged scientists from working on the H-bomb, as had been alleged in Nichols' letter. It found that "there is no evidence that he was a member of the [Communist] party in the strict sense of the word," and concluded that he is a "loyal citizen". It said that he "had a high degree of discretion, reflecting an unusual ability to keep to himself vital secrets," but that he had "a tendency to be coerced, or at least influenced in conduct, for a period of years."

The board found that Oppenheimer's association with Chevalier "is not the kind of thing that our security system permits on the part of one who customarily has access to information of the highest classification", and concluded that "Oppenheimer's continuing conduct reflects a serious disregard for the requirements of the security system," that he was susceptible "to influence which could have serious implications for the security interests of the country," that his attitude toward the H-bomb program raised doubt about whether his future participation "would be consistent with the best interests of security," and that Oppenheimer had been "less than candid in several instances" in his testimony. The majority therefore did not recommend that his security clearance be reinstated.

In a brief dissent, Evans argued that Oppenheimer's security clearance should be reinstated. He pointed out that most of the AEC charges had been in the hands of the AEC when it cleared Oppenheimer in 1947, and that "to deny him clearance now for what he was cleared for in 1947, when we must know he is less of a security risk now than he was then, seems to be hardly the procedure to be adopted in a free country." Evans said that his association with Chevalier did not indicate disloyalty, and that he did not hinder development of the H-bomb. Evans said he personally thought that "our failure to clear Dr. Oppenheimer will be a black mark on the escutcheon of our country," and expressed concern about the effect an improper decision might have on the country's scientific development.

In a harshly worded memorandum to the AEC on June 12, 1954, Nichols recommended that Oppenheimer's security clearance not be reinstated. In five "security findings", Nichols said that Oppenheimer was "a Communist in every sense except that he did not carry a party card," and that the Chevalier incident indicated that Oppenheimer "is not reliable or trustworthy", and that his misstatements might have represented criminal conduct. He said that Oppenheimer's "obstruction and disregard for security" showed "a consistent disregard of a reasonable security system." The Nichols memorandum was not made public nor provided to Oppenheimer's lawyers, who were not allowed to appear before the AEC.

On June 29, 1954, the AEC upheld the findings of the Personnel Security Board, with five commissioners voting in favor and one opposed. The decision was rendered 32 hours before Oppenheimer's consultant contract, and with it the need for a clearance, was due to expire. In his majority opinion, Strauss said that Oppenheimer had displayed "fundamental character defects". He said that Oppenheimer "in his associations had repeatedly exhibited a willful disregard of the normal and proper obligations of security," and that he "has defaulted not once but many times upon the obligations that should and must be willingly borne by citizens in the national service."

Despite the promise of confidentiality, the AEC released an edited transcript of the hearing in June 1954, after press publicity of the hearing. The unredacted transcripts were released in 2012.

The loss of his security clearance ended Oppenheimer's role in government and policy. Although he was not fired from his job at the <a href="Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a>, as he had feared he might be, he became an academic exile, cut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create. He gave public lectures, and spent several months of each year on the small island of <a href="Saint%20John%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint John</a> in the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean</a>. <a href="Kai%20Bird">Kai Bird</a> and <a href="Martin%20J.%20Sherwin">Martin J. Sherwin</a> considered the Oppenheimer case "a defeat for American liberalism". Summing up the fallout from the case, they wrote that:

Oppenheimer was seen by many in the scientific community as a <a href="martyr">martyr</a> to <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>, a modern <a href="Galileo">Galileo</a> or <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a>, an intellectual and progressive unjustly attacked by warmongering enemies, symbolic of the shift of scientific creativity from academia into the military. Patrick McGrath noted that "Scientists and administrators such as Edward Teller, Lewis Strauss and Ernest Lawrence, with their full-throated militarism and anti-communism pushed American scientists and their institutions toward a nearly complete and subservient devotion to American military interests." Scientists continued to work for the AEC, but they no longer trusted it.

Loyalty and security tests spread through the federal government. At these inquiries, federal employees were asked questions such as:

Strauss, Teller, Borden, and Robb would never escape the public identification of them with the case. In a 1962 television interview, <a href="Eric%20F.%20Goldman">Eric F. Goldman</a> asked Teller whether he favored restoring Oppenheimer's security clearance. Teller was struck dumb, unable to find an answer. The question was deleted from the version that was aired, but the news got out and made headlines. President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> decided that the time had come to rehabilitate Oppenheimer. Teller nominated Oppenheimer for the 1963 <a href="Enrico%20Fermi%20Award">Enrico Fermi Award</a>. The nomination was unanimously approved by the GAC and AEC, and announced on April 5, 1963. On November 22, the White House confirmed that Kennedy would personally present the award, but he was <a href="Assassination%20of%20John%20F.%20Kennedy">assassinated later that day</a>. The award was presented by President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> instead. Oppenheimer died of cancer on February 18, 1967.

<a href="Wernher%20von%20Braun">Wernher von Braun</a> summed up his opinion about the matter with a quip to a Congressional committee: "In England, Oppenheimer would have been knighted."

"<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine literary critic Richard Lacayo, in a 2005 review of two new books about Oppenheimer, said of the hearing: "As an effort to prove that he had been a party member, much less one involved in espionage, the inquest was a failure. Its real purpose was larger, however: to punish the most prominent American critic of the U.S. move from atomic weapons to the much more lethal hydrogen bomb." After the hearing, Lacayo said, "Oppenheimer would never again feel comfortable as a public advocate for a sane nuclear policy."

<a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a> historian <a href="Richard%20Polenberg">Richard Polenberg</a> noted that Oppenheimer testified about the left-wing behavior of his colleagues and speculated that if his clearance had not been stripped, he would have been remembered as someone who had "named names" to save his own reputation. In a book "Brotherhood of the Bomb: The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence, and Edward Teller" (2002), Gregg Herken, a senior historian at the Smithsonian Institution, contended, based on newly discovered documentation, that Oppenheimer was a member of the Communist Party.

In a seminar at the Woodrow Wilson Institute on May 20, 2009, and based on an extensive analysis of the Vassiliev notebooks taken from the KGB archives, John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and Alexander Vassiliev concluded that Oppenheimer never was involved in espionage for the Soviets. The KGB tried repeatedly to recruit him, but were never successful. Allegations that he had spied for the Soviets are unsupported, and in some instances, contradicted by voluminous KGB and <a href="Venona">Venona</a> documentation released after the fall of the Soviet Union. In addition, he had several persons removed from the Manhattan project who had sympathies to the Soviet Union.

Most popular depictions of Oppenheimer view his security struggles as a confrontation between right-wing militarists (symbolized by Edward Teller) and left-wing intellectuals (symbolized by Oppenheimer) over the moral question of weapons of mass destruction. Many historians have contested this as an oversimplification.

The hearing was dramatized in a 1964 play by German playwright <a href="Heinar%20Kipphardt">Heinar Kipphardt</a>, "In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer". Oppenheimer objected to the play, threatening suit and decrying "improvisations which were contrary to history and to the nature of the people involved", including its portrayal of him as viewing the bomb as a "work of the devil". His letter to Kipphardt said, "You may well have forgotten Guernica, Dachau, Coventry, Belsen, Warsaw, Dresden and Tokyo. I have not." Of his security hearing, he said, "The whole damn thing was a farce, and these people are trying to make a tragedy out of it."

In a response, Kipphardt offered to make corrections but defended the play, which premiered on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> in June 1968, with <a href="Joseph%20Wiseman">Joseph Wiseman</a> in the Oppenheimer role. "New York Times" theater critic <a href="Clive%20Barnes">Clive Barnes</a> called it an "angry play and a partisan play" that sided with Oppenheimer but portrayed the scientist as a "tragic fool and genius".

Royal Gold Cup

The Royal Gold Cup or Saint Agnes Cup is a solid <a href="gold">gold</a> covered cup lavishly decorated with <a href="vitreous%20enamel">enamel</a> and <a href="pearl">pearl</a>s. It was made for the <a href="John%20II%20of%20France%23Family%20and%20children">French royal family</a> at the end of the 14th century, and later belonged to several English monarchs before spending nearly 300 years in Spain. It has been in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> since 1892, where it is normally on display in Room 40, and is generally agreed to be the outstanding surviving example of late medieval French plate. It has been described as "the one surviving royal magnificence of the <a href="International%20Gothic">International Gothic</a> age"; and according to <a href="Thomas%20Hoving">Thomas Hoving</a>, former director of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> in New York, "of all the princely jewels and gold that have come down to us, this is the most spectacular—and that includes the great royal treasures."

The cup is made of solid gold, stands 23.6 cm (9.25 inches) high with a diameter of 17.8 cm (6.94 inches) at its widest point, and weighs 1.935 kg (4.26 lb). It has a cover that lifts off, but the triangular stand on which it once stood is now lost. The stem of the cup has twice been extended by the addition of cylindrical bands, so that it was originally much shorter, giving the overall shape "a typically robust and stocky elegance." The original decorated knop or finial on the cover has been lost, and a moulding decorated with 36 pearls has been removed from the outer edge of the cover; a strip of gold with jagged edges can be seen where it was attached. Presumably it matched the one still in place round the foot of the cup.

The gold surfaces are decorated with scenes in "<a href="basse-taille">basse-taille</a>" enamel with translucent colours that reflect light from the gold beneath; many areas of gold both underneath the enamel and in the background have <a href="engraving">engraved</a> and "<a href="pointill%C3%A9">pointillé</a>" decoration worked in the gold. In particular the decoration features large areas of translucent red, which have survived in excellent condition. This colour, known as "rouge clair", was the most difficult to achieve technically, and highly prized for this and the brilliance of the colour when it was done successfully. Scenes from the life of <a href="Saint%20Agnes">Saint Agnes</a> run round the top of the cover and the sloping underside of the main body. The <a href="Four%20Evangelists">symbols of the Four Evangelists</a> run round the foot of the cup, and there are enamel medallions at the centre of the inside of both the cup and the cover. The lower of the two added bands contains enamel <a href="Tudor%20rose">Tudor rose</a>s on a <a href="Diapering">diapered</a> pointillé background; this was apparently added under <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a>. The upper band has an engraved inscription filled in with black enamel, with a barrier of <a href="Bay%20Laurel">laurel</a> branches in green to mark off the end of the inscription from its beginning.

The cup came to the British Museum with a custom-made <a href="hexagonal">hexagonal</a> case of leather on a wood frame, with iron lock, handles and mounts. This was either made at the same time or soon after the cup, and has incised and stamped foliate decoration and a <a href="blackletter">blackletter</a> inscription: "YHE.SUS.O.MARYA.O.MARYA YHE SUS".

There is no firm evidence as to the date and circumstances of the creation of the cup. It is first clearly documented in an inventory from 1391 of the valuables belonging to <a href="Charles%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVI%20of%20France">Charles VI of France</a> (reigned 1380–1422), surviving in two copies in the <a href="Biblioth%C3%A8que%20nationale%20de%20France">Bibliothèque nationale de France</a>. This lists:
A <a href="hanaper">hanap</a> of gold, all its cover well and richly enamelled on the outside with the life of Madame St Agnes; and the cresting of the foot is garnished with 26 pearls, and the crown around the cover with 36 pearls; and the finial of the said cover (is) garnished with four sapphires, three <a href="Spinel">balas rubies</a> and fifteen pearls. And it weighs 9 <a href="Mark%20%28mass%29">marcs</a> 3 ounces of gold. and the said hanap rests on a stand of gold in the form of a tripod, and in the middle of the tripod is represented <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Our Lady</a> in a sun on a ground of clear red, and the three feet of the tripod are formed by three winged dragons. The said hanap and cover were given to the king by monseigneur the duc de Berry on his journey into <a href="Touraine">Touraine</a> in the year 91.
<a href="John%2C%20Duke%20of%20Berry">John, Duke of Berry</a> (1340–1416) was Charles VI's uncle and a powerful figure in the kingdom, as well as the most famous and extravagant collector and commissioner of art of his day. He is still best known for commissioning the "<a href="Tr%C3%A8s%20Riches%20Heures%20du%20Duc%20de%20Berry">Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry</a>", the famous International Gothic <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a>, and also commissioned the <a href="Holy%20Thorn%20Reliquary">Holy Thorn Reliquary</a>, now in the British Museum. The young king Charles had been forced to remove his uncle from governorships after the latter's rapacious conduct had led to unrest, and the meeting in 1391 marked their reconciliation after a period of bad relations. Lavish gifts among the <a href="House%20of%20Valois">Valois</a> court circle were routine, and on this occasion Berry had special reason to be generous.

The cup appears in another inventory of Charles VI in 1400, and then is not recorded until it appears as the property of another royal uncle, and collector, <a href="John%20of%20Lancaster%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Bedford">John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford</a> (1389–1435), son of <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20England">Henry IV</a>, who was briefly Regent of both France and England for his infant nephew <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">Henry VI</a>. How he acquired the cup is not known, but he would have received many gifts from Charles VI, and had both lent the king money and bought from him things such as the library of the <a href="Louvre%20Palace">Palais du Louvre</a>, in the uneasy period when Charles had made peace with the English and made <a href="Henry%20V%20of%20England">Henry V</a> his heir. After the death of his brother Henry V, Bedford <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War%20%281415%E2%80%931429%29">struggled to stem</a> the resurgent French resistance, which was energised by <a href="Joan%20of%20Arc">Joan of Arc</a>. He died in <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> in 1435, leaving Henry VI as his heir.

The cup is more briefly described as the first item in a list of valuables received from Bedford's estate prepared for Henry VI's minister Cardinal <a href="Henry%20Beaufort">Henry Beaufort</a>, but the tripod is not mentioned, some of the jewels are missing, and the subject is misidentified as the life of Saint Suzanna not Saint Agnes. For some reason it does not appear in a royal inventory of 1441; Jenny Stratford suggests that this was because Beaufort still had it at this point. Another possibility is that it had been pawned, as it was in 1449 and again in 1451, on both occasions to finance England's to hold on to French territory;

The cup first appears in the records of the new <a href="Tudor%20dynasty">Tudor dynasty</a> under <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> in 1521. By now the cover had lost the finial "garnished with four sapphires, three balas rubies and fifteen pearls" described in Charles VI's inventory and had a new one of gold in the form of a closed, or "imperial" crown. This matches a propaganda drive at this time by Henry to assert England as an "empire", a contemporary sense meaning a state recognising no superior, though the <a href="Great%20Seal%20of%20England">Great Seal of England</a> had already used a closed crown since 1471. Other uses had probably been found for the jewels of the old finial; it is assumed that the lower band with the Tudor roses was added in Henry's reign, as part of a programme of adding Tudor badges to possessions inherited from earlier dynasties, which covered <a href="tapestries">tapestries</a>, <a href="illuminated%20manuscripts">illuminated manuscripts</a> and buildings such as <a href="King%27s%20College%20Chapel">King's College Chapel</a> in <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. The cup is described in inventories in 1532 and <a href="Inventory%20of%20Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">after Henry's death in 1547</a>, and then under <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a> it was inventoried in 1574 and 1596.
When <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I</a> succeeded to the English throne in 1603, one of his first priorities was to end the <a href="Anglo-Spanish%20War%20%281585%29">Anglo-Spanish War</a>, which had been dragging on since 1585. A Spanish delegation arrived for the <a href="Treaty%20of%20London%20%281604%29">Somerset House Conference</a>, which concluded with a treaty signed in 1604. The leader of the <a href="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> diplomats was <a href="Juan%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20de%20Velasco%2C%205th%20Duke%20of%20Fr%C3%ADas">Juan Fernández de Velasco, 5th Duke of Frías</a> and <a href="Constable%20of%20Castile">Constable of Castile</a>. The upper extension to the stem of the cup has a Latin inscription that translates as:
This cup of solid gold, a relic of the sacred treasure of England and a memorial to the peace made between the kings, the Constable Juan de Velasco, returning thence after successfully accomplishing his mission, presented as an offering to Christ the Peacemaker.

The gift of "some 70 items of silver and gold plate" by James to the Constable, of which the cup was the most notable item, is documented on both the English and Spanish sides; the Constable wrote an account of his mission on his return, which mentions the gift from James. The Constable had previously presented both James and the queen with elaborate cups, among other valuable gifts. According to Pauline Croft, "With his usual over-generosity the king gave the departing envoys around half the large gold vessels from the royal possessions he had inherited from Elizabeth. The Constable himself received a stupendous gift of plate, including possibly the most venerable item in the collection, known as "the Royal Gold Cup of the Kings of France and England."

In 1610 the Constable gave the cup to a convent in <a href="Medina%20de%20Pomar">Medina de Pomar</a>, near <a href="Burgos">Burgos</a>, as the inscription describes. His deed of gift survives, and records that the gift was on condition that the cup was never alienated by the convent. A marginal note on the deed, in the Constable's own handwriting, records that he had obtained the permission of the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Toledo">Archbishop of Toledo</a>, <a href="Bernardo%20de%20Sandoval%20y%20Rojas">Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas</a>, for the cup to be used as a <a href="Ciborium%20%28container%29">ciborium</a>, or container for consecrated <a href="Sacramental%20bread">hosts</a>. By this period a rule of the church normally forbade the use of vessels decorated on their inner surface as ciboria.
The cup stayed in the convent until 1882 when the nuns were short of funds and wanted to sell it. It was at some point during this period that the pearl border to the cover and the Tudor finial were removed. The nuns decided they would get a better price in Paris than in Spain, and the cup was entrusted to Simon Campo, a priest, who took it to Paris and approached several leading dealers and collectors. There had been a spate of forgeries of medieval objects, and the Parisians were suspicious, until one, Baron <a href="J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Pichon">Jérôme Pichon</a>, researched the second added cylinder and was sufficiently convinced that this was the cup documented in 1604 to make a rather low offer, which was accepted. In the course of his researches the baron had contacted the current <a href="Duke%20of%20Fr%C3%ADas">Duke of Frías</a>, who had supplied useful information, and then initially congratulated the buyer on his purchase. However, on looking further into the matter the duke realized that the sale was contrary to the 1610 deed of gift he had discovered in the family archives, and sued in the French courts to recover the cup.

The duke eventually lost his case in 1891, enabling a further sale that had been set up by Baron Pichon to proceed. This was to the leading firm of Messrs. Wertheimer of <a href="Bond%20Street">Bond Street</a> in London, where the cup was seen by <a href="Augustus%20Wollaston%20Franks">Augustus Wollaston Franks</a>, who had been Keeper of British and Mediaeval Antiquities and Ethnography at the British Museum since 1866, and was president of the <a href="Society%20of%20Antiquaries%20of%20London">Society of Antiquaries</a>. Samson Wertheimer agreed "with much public spirit" to sell the cup to the British Museum for the £8,000 (£  in 2019) it had cost the firm. Franks was worried by the new American collectors such as <a href="J.%20P.%20Morgan">J. P. Morgan</a>, and in 1891 wrote to Sir <a href="Henry%20Tate">Henry Tate</a>, of <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a> fame: "A very wonderful gold cup has appeared returned to this country after an absence of 287 years, and I am anxious to see it placed in the National Museum and not removed to America."

Franks tried to get wealthy individuals to subscribe £500 (£  in 2019) each, but even with a grant of £2,000 from <a href="HM%20Treasury">HM Treasury</a> could not raise the price. He was forced to put up £5,000 of his own money temporarily while he continued to try to get smaller amounts from others, and succeeded in 1892 when the Treasury agreed to contribute the final £830; "to Franks this was his greatest acquisition, and the one of which he was most proud." Apart from the Treasury, the £500 contributors were Franks and Wertheimer, the <a href="Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Goldsmiths">Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths</a>, <a href="Fortnum%20%26amp%3B%20Mason">Charles Drury Edward Fortnum</a>, the <a href="Algernon%20Percy%2C%206th%20Duke%20of%20Northumberland">Duke of Northumberland</a>, <a href="John%20Savile%2C%201st%20Baron%20Savile%20of%20Rufford">Lord Savile</a>, <a href="Edward%20Cecil%20Guinness%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Iveagh">Lord Iveagh</a> and the <a href="James%20Ludovic%20Lindsay%2C%2026th%20Earl%20of%20Crawford">Earl of Crawford</a>. In 1901 Morgan succeeded in buying the <a href="Lindau%20Gospels">Lindau Gospels</a> in London, which the museum had also wanted.

Much the most prominent decoration on the cup is the cycle of scenes from the life of <a href="Saint%20Agnes">Saint Agnes</a>, which is rarely depicted in such detail in art. However, there was one outstanding devotee of the saint in the period: King <a href="Charles%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BV%20of%20France">Charles V of France</a>, Berry's older brother and Charles VI's father. Charles V was born in 1338 on Saint Agnes' <a href="feast%20day">feast day</a>, January 21, and is recorded as owning at least 13 works of art featuring her, including a different gold cup enamelled with scenes from her life (both are recorded in the 1391 inventory). Until recent decades the generally accepted hypothesis was that Berry ordered the cup as a present for his brother in 1380, to be ready for his birthday in January 1381. When the king died in September 1380, Berry had retained it for a decade before presenting it to Charles VI.
However, in 1978 Ronald Lightbown, Keeper of Metalwork at the <a href="V%26amp%3BA%20Museum">V&A Museum</a>, rejected this theory on stylistic grounds, considering that the cup must have been created only shortly before it appeared in Charles VI's inventory in 1391. He says that "in 1380 figure-style was a softly undulating, flowing style, with slender elongated figures and much use of serpentine or curving folds in the drapery, and with trailing dresses ending in sinuous Gothic hem-lines" —a style that can be seen in the miniature of the coronation of Charles VI in 1380 illustrated above. In contrast, Lightbown says "the figures on the cup are broad, some might even be called stocky, with soft drapery of cylindrical form, or of smooth, tight outlines. The folds are tubular and the hems of the robes are straight with no waving, trailing outlines. The style in fact is the 'Italianate' manner which developed in France as a result of contact with '<a href="trecento">trecento</a>' art, and not the purely Northern Gothic International manner." This view was rejected in 1981 by Neil Stratford, former Keeper of Medieval and Later Antiquities at the British Museum, who pointed to a number of manuscript illuminations in a similar style that date from earlier than 1390. John Cherry, another former Keeper of the medieval collections at the British Museum, still presents the older dating in a work of 2010, and the British Museum website dates the cup to "about 1370–1380".

Another traditional assumption, based on the language of the inventories and shared by almost all writers, was that the cup was a piece of secular plate, for use at table, or display on a "buffet" beside it. The "buffet" of the period was more like a modern <a href="Welsh%20dresser">Welsh dresser</a> or shop display unit, with receding shelves for displaying on important occasions all the plate of the household that was not in use. Neil Stratford suggests that the cup was only used to drink from on special occasions, including St Agnes' feast day, while Lightbown remarks that at over four pounds in weight the cup is much too heavy to drink from conveniently. However John Cherry, noting the exclusively religious subjects depicted (including that on the lost tripod stand) considers that the cup may have been intended as a ciborium from the start. It might have been used either to accompany in its carrying case the duke on his tours of his many castles and palaces, or perhaps for his foundation of the "Saint Chapelle" at his capital of <a href="Bourges">Bourges</a>, intended to rival the king's "<a href="Sainte-Chapelle">Sainte-Chapelle</a>" in Paris and his brother's foundation at <a href="Champmol">Champmol</a> in <a href="Dijon">Dijon</a>.

The four sons of King <a href="John%20II%20of%20France">John II of France</a>—Charles V, <a href="Louis%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI%2C%20Duke%20of%20Anjou">Louis I, Duke of Anjou</a> (1339–1384), Berry and <a href="Philip%20the%20Bold">Philip the Bold</a>, <a href="Duke%20of%20Burgundy">Duke of Burgundy</a> (1342–1404)—all spent huge sums on works in gold and silver, as well as on other works of art. Although it is Berry who is especially remembered as a patron, partly because he specialized in illuminated manuscripts which have little value in their materials, it was his brother Louis of Anjou who was the "most passionately interested in the goldsmith's art"; he had over 3,000 pieces of plate at one point. These included wholly secular pieces with sculptures in enamel that can only be imagined by comparison: in terms of technique to the handful of <a href="reliquaries">reliquaries</a>, like the British Museum's <a href="Holy%20Thorn%20Reliquary">Holy Thorn Reliquary</a>, that have survived from the period, and in terms of subject matter to tapestries and illuminations. However, in 1381 Anjou melted down almost all his plate to finance a war to pursue his claim to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Naples">Kingdom of Naples</a>. According to the sculptor and goldsmith <a href="Lorenzo%20Ghiberti">Lorenzo Ghiberti</a>, writing seventy years later, one of Anjou's goldsmiths, called Gusmin and "a most skillful sculptor, of great talent", was so affected by the destruction of his life's work that he joined an <a href="Hermit">eremetic monastic order</a> and lived out his days in silence.

The Royal Gold Cup was "probably not exceptional as to size or decoration" in this milieu; once "but one member of a class, it now stands alone". An inventory of Charles V records 25 gold cups weighing between five and fifteen "marcs"; this is slightly over nine without its stand. Smaller gold cups are recorded in sets of a dozen, of which Charles V had three. The largest items were the great table ornaments, in the shape of ships, called <a href="Nef%20%28metalwork%29">nefs</a>, of which Charles V had five, the heaviest weighing over 53 "marcs".

Berry died in 1416 with no male heir, and deeply in debt. Those of his works in precious metal and jewels that had not already gone to his creditors were mostly seized by the English when they took Paris in July 1417. This was the first of a number of periods that saw the large-scale destruction of goldsmiths' work that the cup escaped, but thousands of other pieces did not, a survival that Brigitte Buettner finds "almost miraculous". In particular, the move to Spain in 1604 enabled it to avoid the dispersal and destruction of the <a href="English%20Crown%20Jewels">English Crown Jewels</a> and royal collection of plate under the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20England">English Commonwealth</a>.
As a secular piece the cup would be an almost unique survival at this level of quality, "the one representative left to us of medieval secular plate in its most sumptuous development". Although French plate in silver and gold was made in great quantities, and at a high level of quality, "French silver made prior to the early 19th century is probably scarcer than that of any other European country." The cost of even very skilled labour was low compared to that of the materials, and in the absence of any reliable way of either depositing or investing money, it was turned into lavish objects, in the knowledge that it might well need to be sold or melted down to finance some future project. If it survived long enough to become old-fashioned it was likely to be melted down and remodelled in a new style.

There are only four other known survivals, secular or religious, of "basse taille" enamel on gold, one the small <a href="George%20Salting">Salting</a> <a href="Reliquary">Reliquary</a>, also in the British Museum, and none as fine as the cup. The "King John Cup" in <a href="King%27s%20Lynn">King's Lynn</a>, of ca. 1340, <a href="silver-gilt">silver-gilt</a> with transparent enamel, is the best example of "basse-taille" work probably made in England; the metalwork expert <a href="Herbert%20Maryon">Herbert Maryon</a> describes this and the Royal Gold Cup as the "two examples of outstanding merit, unsurpassed in any collection." However it is unclear if most of the enamel at King's Lynn is original. The closest comparison to the Royal Gold Cup is perhaps the silver-gilt <a href="M%C3%A9rode%20Cup">Mérode Cup</a> of about 1400, which is the only surviving medieval example of "plique á jour" enamel, a difficult technique which creates a see-through effect like stained glass. A silver-gilt cup in the <a href="Rijksmuseum%2C%20Amsterdam">Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam</a> of before 1376 has no enamels or gems, and a different shape, but offers an interesting comparison as it has a tripod stand with winged grotesques as legs, a short stem, and the cover has both an elaborate finial and a raised decorated strip around the rim, so that all the altered aspects of the Royal Gold Cup are present.

The cycle of scenes from the life of Saint Agnes, and that of her foster-sister <a href="Saint%20Emerentiana">Saint Emerentiana</a>, follows the traditional story of "<a href="Golden%20Legend">Golden Legend</a>" of <a href="Jacobus%20de%20Voragine">Jacobus de Voragine</a>; the most popular compilation of <a href="hagiographies">hagiographies</a> of the age, whose wording corresponds to some of the inscriptions in <a href="banderole%20%28speech%20scroll%29">banderole</a>s or scrolls that explain the scenes. Other texts are quotations from the Latin <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a> Bible, mostly derived from the <a href="liturgy">liturgy</a> for St Agnes' feast day, and it has been suggested that the two rings of pearls also reflect the language of the chants for these services. It seems likely that <a href="clergy">clerical</a> advice was taken, at least over the texts used in the inscriptions. It is tempting to relate the depiction of the story, with its "distinct and vivid tableaux, well suited to adaptation for performance" to <a href="medieval%20drama">medieval drama</a>, often a source for <a href="iconography">iconography</a>, but the fragmentary records mention no dramas on the life of St Agnes that are close in time or place to the origin of the cup.

Agnes and her sister were virgins of Rome in the time of the Emperor <a href="Constantine%20I">Constantine</a>, though all figures are shown in contemporary 14th-century dress. The story begins on the inside of the bowl, which has a round medallion showing St Agnes kneeling before a bearded figure, representing her teacher, wearing a <a href="chaperon%20%28headgear%29">chaperon</a>. She holds a book inscribed "Miserere mei Deus sancte" ("Have pity on me, Holy God"), while a banderole says "In corde meo abscondi eloquia tua ut non peccem tibi" ("Thy words have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee". ). The top of the cover continues the story up to Agnes' <a href="martyrdom">martyrdom</a> in five scenes, shown with a continuous groundline from which small rocks rise up to demarcate the scenes; on the base trees perform this function. Sunrays radiate from the centre of the cover above all the scenes; the red enamel which once filled these is nearly all lost.
In the first scene the two girls are returning from school, Agnes accompanied by her punning <a href="emblem">attribute</a>, a <a href="domestic%20sheep">lamb</a> with a cruciform <a href="halo%20%28religious%20iconography%29">halo</a>, and carrying a martyr's <a href="Arecaceae">palm</a>. They are accosted by Procopius, the young son of the <a href="Prefect%20of%20Rome">Prefect of Rome</a>, who has fallen in love with Agnes and shows her an open casket of jewels to persuade her to marry him. The inside of the casket is white, the only colour of opaque enamel in the original work, used only for a few highlights like the tiny area of the host held by Christ on the inside of the cover. Agnes rejects him, with the words "Illi sum desponsata cui angeli serviunt" ("I am betrothed to him who the angels serve") in a banderole above. In the Caxton her rejection is unequivocal and not polite, and she points out that her heavenly fiancé has promised her much better jewels. The Prefect stands behind his son, and in the next scene has sentenced her to serve in a <a href="brothel">brothel</a> for being a Christian who refuses to sacrifice to the goddess <a href="Vesta%20%28mythology%29">Vesta</a>. Caxton's "Legend" fills in the intervening action: Then made she of the bordel her oratory, ... All they that entered made honour and reverence to the great clearness that they saw about St. Agnes, and came out more devout and more clean than they entered. At last came the son of the provost with a great company for to accomplish his foul desires and lusts. And when he saw his fellows come out and issue all abashed, he mocked them and called them cowards. And then he, all araged, entered for to accomplish his evil will. And when he came to the clearness, he advanced him for to take the virgin, and anon the devil took him by the throat and strangled him that he fell down dead. In the next scene on the cup, Agnes stands outside the sentry box-like brothel, looking down at the Prefect's son who has been strangled to death by the devil crouched over him; a banderole reads "Quo modo cecidisti qui mane oriebaris" ("How has thou fallen that risest in the morning", ), and the Prefect looks on sadly.

In the following scene Agnes has been moved by the Prefect's grief, and prayed for the son to be restored to life, which an angel has done. The repentant Procopius kneels before her, while she leans down to tell him "Vade amplius noli peccare" ("Go forth and sin no more"; from ). However the result of the miracle was that (in <a href="William%20Caxton">William Caxton</a>'s translation) "the bishops of the idols made a great discord among the people, so that all they cried: Take away this sorceress and witch that turned men's minds and alieneth their wits". The Prefect is now sympathetic to Agnes but fears he will lose his position if he does nothing, so leaves the matter in the hands of another official; the two are seen talking together, with words from "Nihil invenio cause in eam" ("I find no cause against her") above. The last scene shows her martyrdom; she was sentenced to be burned but the flames part away from her so that finally the magistrate orders her killed by a spear. Her last words, from , are "In manus tuas domine commendo animam meam" ("Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit").
The scenes continue on the underside of the bowl, starting with Agnes' burial. A <a href="pall%20%28funeral%29">pall</a> is being laid over her <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a>, whose red enamel has significant losses, which reveal clearly the engraved lines beneath. A <a href="tonsure">tonsure</a>d priest with an <a href="Aspergillum">aspergil</a> for sprinkling <a href="holy%20water">holy water</a> and an <a href="acolyte">acolyte</a> with a cross attend, with Emerentiana with halo to the left, and Agnes' mother to the right. The banderole above says "Ecce quod concupivi iam teneo" ("Behold what I have desired I now possess"). In the next scene pagans have arrived to disrupt the burial, and only Emerentiana has stayed, kneeling in prayer as she is pelted with rocks. The inscription reads "Veni soror mea mecum in gloria" ("Come with me my sister into glory"). She dies, and the following scene shows the two martyrs, accompanied by two other unnamed female martyrs (in the source "a great multitude of virgins clad in vestments of gold and silver"), as they appear in a vision to Agnes' friends eight days after her death, as they gather round her sarcophagus, into which Emerentiana's body has also been placed.

The next scene shows the sarcophagus with <a href="Constantina">Constantina</a>, the daughter of the Emperor Constantine, asleep on top of it, wearing a crown. She has been afflicted with <a href="leprosy">leprosy</a>, and heard of the vision at Agnes' tomb, and come to pray there. The presence at left of a young man on crutches, not in the source, suggests that others are doing the same. The sleeping woman beside the tomb is either another such, or an attendant on the princess. As Constantina sleeps, Agnes, holding her lamb, appears to her, saying "Si in xpm (Christum) credideris sanaberis" ("If you believe in Christ you will be healed", an adaptation of the text in the source). In the final scene, the cured, and baptized, Constantina tells her crowned father the story, with the inscription "Hec est virgo sapiens una de numero prudencium" ("This is a wise virgin, one of the number of the prudent").

The inside of the cover has a circular enamel medallion with worked gold borders, showing a half-length Christ making a blessing gesture and holding a <a href="chalice">chalice</a> with a host inside. Around him is a sun-like <a href="aureole">aureole</a> in red. Below the two added cylinders on the stem, the four traditional <a href="Evangelist%27s%20symbol">symbols of the Evangelists</a> run round the sloping foot of the cup, in pairs facing each other, above a green ground area. Lightbown notes this as "another sign of care for naturalistic effect".

Each of the cover, main body, and foot of the cup is made of an inner and outer plate, and the enamelled medallions inside the cover and bowl were made separately before attachment. The enamel areas may have been designed by the goldsmith, or an artist more used to painting on panels or in manuscripts may have produced drawings. A number of names of goldsmiths appear in records of the period, but in contrast to many contemporary manuscripts, the few surviving goldsmith's pieces are not signed or marked and cannot be matched to any names. Not a single maker's name is recorded for the more than 3,000 items in precious metal in the inventory mentioned above of the possessions of Berry's brother Anjou. High quality courtly work like the cup is conventionally assigned to Paris in the absence of other stylistic evidence; this is where other documentary sources locate the main concentration of goldsmiths.

The process for creating the "<a href="basse-taille">basse-taille</a>" enamel areas began by marking the outline of the design and the main internal outlines on the gold with a tool called a "tracer". Then the interior area was worked with <a href="Repouss%C3%A9%20and%20chasing">chasing tools</a>, hammering and punching rather than cutting, to form a shallow recess to hold the enamel. The more important parts of the design were modelled by varying the depth of the surface to produce different intensities of colour when the translucent enamel was added; the gold under folds of drapery often rises near the surface to create a paler highlight. In many of the recessed areas decoration was added by either engraving or punching which would show through the translucent enamel, or to facet the background so the reflections change as the viewing angle changes slightly. In these last-mentioned areas cutting tools were used. Most of the background outside the enamelled areas was decorated in the same way. After the enamel was added and fired the surfaces were cleaned up, made good and polished, including removing by scraping any bumps showing through on the reverse of the metal.

The enamel lies flush with the gold surfaces; it was a preparation of finely ground glass paste applied with great care to the prepared recessed areas, and then fired. Different colours of enamel meet each other with a neat boundary, which was achieved by firing one colour with a retaining border of <a href="gum%20tragacanth">gum tragacanth</a> before adding the next. The difficulty was increased by the application of tints of a different colour to a base shade of enamel before firing, so that the added colour blends gradually into the background colour around the edges of the tinted area. This is especially used on "flux", or colourless enamel, as in the ground areas, rocks and trees. Flux was also used for flesh areas as on a gold background it darkens slightly when fired to a suitable colour for skin. The "rouge clair" or "ruby glass" red, used so effectively here, was made by adding tiny particles of <a href="copper">copper</a>, silver and gold to the glass; here scientific tests have shown that copper was used. After firing the enamel was polished flush with the surrounding metal. The technique had been known to the Ancient Romans (see the <a href="Lycurgus%20Cup">Lycurgus Cup</a>, also in the British Museum), but was lost at the end of the Middle Ages until the 17th century. The added cylinders use opaque enamel, except for the red on the Tudor roses, which is translucent "rouge clair", of a similar composition to the original reds. Translucent enamel is more fragile than opaque, and medieval survivals in good condition are very rare.

Charles Domery

Charles Domery ( 1778 – after 1800), later also known as Charles Domerz, was a Polish soldier serving in the <a href="Prussian%20Army">Prussian</a> and <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Army">French</a> armies, noted for his <a href="polyphagia">unusually large appetite</a>. Serving in the Prussian Army against France during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20First%20Coalition">War of the First Coalition</a>, he found that the rations of the Prussians were insufficient and deserted to the French Army in return for food. Although generally healthy, he was voraciously hungry during his time in the French service, and ate any available food. While stationed near Paris, he was recorded as having eaten 174 cats in a year, and although he disliked vegetables, he would eat of grass each day if he could not find other food. During service on the French ship "<a href="HMS%20Donegal%20%281798%29">Hoche</a>", he attempted to eat the severed leg of a crew member hit by cannon fire, before other members of the crew wrestled it from him.

In February 1799, the "Hoche" was captured by British forces and the crew, including Domery, were interned in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, where he shocked his captors with his voracious appetite: despite being put on ten times the usual rations, he ate the prison cat and at least 20 rats, and would often eat the prison candles. In one experiment, over the course of a day he ate of raw cow's udder, raw beef and <a href="tallow">tallow</a> candles and four bottles of <a href="porter%20%28beer%29">porter</a>, all of which he ate and drank without defecating, urinating, or vomiting.

Almost everything known about Domery comes from a 1799 account by Dr. J. Johnston in the "<a href="Medical%20and%20Physical%20Journal">Medical and Physical Journal</a>", based largely upon information provided by Dr. Thomas Cochrane.

Charles Domery (later also known as Charles Domerz) was born in Benche, Poland, in around 1778. From the age of 13, Domery had an unusually large appetite. He was one of nine brothers, all of whom Domery said suffered from the same condition. Domery recalled that his father was a hearty eater and generally ate his meat half-boiled, but was too young to recall the quantity. The only illness Domery was aware of in the family was an outbreak of smallpox in his youth, which was survived by all the family.

Despite his unusual diet and behaviour in the presence of food, doctors described Domery as of a normal build, and tall for the period at . He had long, brown hair and grey eyes, was smooth-skinned, and was described as having a "pleasant countenance". Doctors observing Domery saw no signs of mental illness and although illiterate, he was considered of normal intelligence by his crewmates and by the prison doctors who studied him. Despite eating vast amounts of food, it was noted by the doctors studying him that he never vomited, other than when fed large amounts of roasted or boiled meat. He showed no outward signs of ill health, and doctors observing him noted that his eyes were lively and his tongue clean. His pulse was regular at around 84 BPM, and his body temperature normal. His muscles were normally formed, but observed by doctors to be weaker than usual, although during his time in the army he had marched 14 French leagues (approximately 25 mi/42 km) in a day with no ill effects.
It was observed that immediately after going to bed, generally at about 8:00 pm, Domery would begin to sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he would fall asleep before waking at around 1:00 am extremely hungry, regardless of what he had eaten before going to bed. At this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00 am he would go back to sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00 am, sweating heavily; as soon as he got out of bed, the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.

By the age of 13, Domery had enlisted in the <a href="Prussian%20Army">Prussian Army</a>, and became part of an army besieging <a href="Thionville">Thionville</a> during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20First%20Coalition">War of the First Coalition</a>. The Prussian Army was suffering from food shortages which Domery found intolerable; he entered the town and surrendered to the French commander who rewarded him with a large melon, which Domery immediately ate, including the rind. He was then given a wide variety of other foodstuffs by the French general, all of which he ate straight away.

Domery then enlisted with the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Army">French Revolutionary Army</a>, and shocked his new comrades with his unusual eating habits and voracious appetite. Granted double rations, and using his pay to buy additional food whenever possible, he nonetheless suffered from extreme hunger; while based in an army camp near Paris, Domery ate 174 cats in a single year, leaving only the skins and bones, and ate of grass each day if other food was unavailable.
He preferred raw meat to cooked; while his favourite dish was a raw <a href="bull">bull</a>ock's <a href="Liver%20%28food%29">liver</a>, he would eat any available meat. While in service on board the French ship <a href="HMS%20Donegal%20%281798%29">"Hoche"</a>, a sailor's leg was shot off by cannon fire, and Domery grabbed the severed limb and began to eat it until a crew member wrestled it from him and threw it into the sea.

In October 1798 a <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> squadron under the command of <a href="Sir%20John%20Borlase%20Warren%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir John Borlase Warren</a> captured the "Hoche" off the coast of Ireland, and those on board, including Domery, were interned in a prison camp near Liverpool. The British guards were shocked by Domery's appetite, and agreed to place him on double rations. These were insufficient, and his rations were increased until eventually he was granted the rations of ten men each day. Rations for prisoners of war in this period were paid for by the country in whose army the prisoners had served. The standard daily ration for a French prisoner of war was of bread, half a pound (230 g) of vegetables and of butter or of cheese.

Domery remained hungry, and was recorded as having eaten the prison cat and at least 20 rats which had strayed into his cell. Domery also ate the medicines of those prisoners in the camp's infirmary who refused to take them, suffering no apparent adverse effects as a result. It was also recorded that he would regularly eat the prison's candles, and that if his ration of beer was exhausted, he would resort to drinking water to wash down his food. (To reduce the risk of water-borne disease, troops were issued rations of mildly alcoholic beverages such as <a href="small%20beer">small beer</a> and diluted rum, and drinks such as tea and coffee which involved boiling water before drinking.)

The prison commander brought his unusual captive to the attention of <a href="Sick%20and%20Hurt%20Commissioners">The Commissioners for taking Care of Sick and Wounded Seamen and for the Care and Treatment of Prisoners of War</a>, the body then responsible for all medical services in the Royal Navy and for overseeing the welfare of <a href="Prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a>. , a member of the Commission, and Dr Cochrane, <a href="Fellow">Fellow</a> of the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Physicians%20of%20Edinburgh">Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh</a>, performed an experiment to test Domery's eating capacity and tolerance for unusual foods. At 4:00 am, Domery was awakened and fed 4 lbs (1.8 kg) of raw cow's <a href="udder">udder</a>, which was eaten without hesitation. At 9:30 am he was given a meal of 5 lbs (2.3 kg) of raw beef, twelve large <a href="tallow">tallow</a> candles totalling one pound (453 g), and a bottle of <a href="porter%20%28beer%29">porter</a>, all of which were consumed. At 1:00 pm Domery was given another meal of a further 5 lbs of beef, a pound (453 g) of candles, and three large bottles of porter, all of which were also eaten and drunk. During the course of the experiment he did not <a href="defecation">defecate</a>, <a href="urination">urinate</a> or <a href="vomiting">vomit</a> at any point, his pulse remained regular and his skin did not change temperature. Upon Domery's return to his quarters at 6:15 pm following the conclusion of the experiment, he was recorded as being of "particularly good cheer", and danced, smoked his pipe and drank a further bottle of porter.

The cause of Domery's appetite is not known. While there are other documented cases of similar behaviour from this period none of the subjects other than Domery's contemporary <a href="Tarrare">Tarrare</a> were autopsied, and there have been no modern documented cases of <a href="polyphagia">polyphagia</a> (excessive appetite) as extreme as Domery. <a href="Hyperthyroidism">Hyperthyroidism</a> can induce an extreme appetite and rapid weight loss, while Bondeson (2006) speculates that Domery possibly suffered from a damaged <a href="amygdala">amygdala</a> or <a href="ventromedial%20nucleus">ventromedial nucleus</a>; it is known that injuries to the amygdala or ventromedial nucleus in animals can induce polyphagia.

It is not recorded what became of Domery, or of the other "Hoche" captives, following their internment, and it is not known if he returned to France or Poland or remained in Liverpool. The case of Charles Domery briefly returned to public notice in 1852 when it came to the attention of <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, who wrote of Domery that "Now, it is my opinion, that a man like this, dining in public on the stage of <a href="Drury%20Lane">Drury Lane</a>, would draw much better than a mere <a href="tragedian">tragedian</a>, who chews unsubstantial words instead of wholesome beef".

Temple Israel (Memphis, Tennessee)

Temple Israel is a <a href="Reform%20Judaism">Reform Jewish</a> congregation in <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. It is the only Reform <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a> in Memphis, the oldest and largest Jewish congregation in Tennessee, and one of the largest Reform congregations in the U.S. It was founded in 1853 by mostly <a href="German%20Jews">German Jews</a> as Congregation B'nai Israel (Hebrew for "Children of Israel"). Led initially by <a href="Hazzan">cantors</a>, in 1858 it hired its first <a href="rabbi">rabbi</a>, Jacob Peres, and leased its first building, which it renovated and eventually purchased.

Peres was fired in 1860 because he opened a store that conducted business on Saturdays, the <a href="Shabbat">Jewish Sabbath</a>. He was replaced by Simon Tuska, who moved the congregation from <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">Orthodox</a> to Reform practices. Tuska died in 1871, and was succeeded by Max Samfield; under his leadership, the synagogue was one of the founding members of the <a href="Union%20for%20Reform%20Judaism">Union for Reform Judaism</a>. In 1884, Children of Israel completed a new building, and membership grew rapidly. Samfield died in 1915, and was succeeded by Bill Fineshriber, an outspoken supporter of <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20States">women's suffrage</a> and equal rights for African Americans. The following year the congregation moved to a new building, where membership continued to grow. Fineshriber left in 1924, and was succeeded by Harry Ettelson.

The synagogue experienced difficulty during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>—membership dropped, the congregational school was closed, and staff had their salaries reduced—but conditions had improved by the late 1930s. In 1943 the synagogue changed its name to Temple Israel, and by the late 1940s membership had almost doubled from its low point in the 1930s. Ettelson retired in 1954, and was succeeded by Jimmy Wax.

Wax became known for his activism during the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>. Though some members—particularly those whose families had lived in the South for generations—had segregationist views, others were prominent in the fight for black civil rights. During Wax's tenure, most of Temple Israel's members moved far from the existing synagogue, and in 1976 the congregation constructed its current building, closer to where most members lived. Wax retired in 1978, and was succeeded by Harry Danziger, who brought traditional practices back to the congregation. He retired in 2000, and was succeeded by Micah Greenstein. , Temple Israel has almost 1,600 member families. Greenstein is the senior rabbi, and the cantorial soloist is Abbie Strauss.

Temple Israel was established as the Orthodox Congregation B'nai Israel in 1853 by 36 heads of families, and granted a charter by the state legislature on , 1854. It grew out of Memphis's Hebrew Benevolent Society, established in 1850 by German Jews. The Benevolent Society managed Memphis's Jewish cemetery, supported poor Jews, and conducted <a href="High%20Holy%20Days">High Holy Day</a> <a href="Jewish%20services">services</a>. The congregation was initially led by part-time cantors. The first was Jonas Levy, who had been hired as cantor and <a href="shechita">ritual slaughterer</a>. Levy was succeeded by H. Judah and then J. Sternheimer. A <a href="Hebrew%20school">Hebrew school</a> was also created, directed by Sternheimer. In 1857, B'nai Israel hired as organist Christopher Philip Winkler, described by Tim Sharp (Dean of Fine Arts at <a href="Rhodes%20College">Rhodes College</a> in Memphis) as the "Dean of Memphis Musicians". Born in Germany in 1824, he had emigrated to the United States at age 16, and moved to Memphis in 1854. There he taught music, performed, and composed works for B'nai Israel's services; by 1894 he had completed over 850 pieces for the congregation.

In its first decades, the congregation worshiped in various locations in downtown Memphis, near the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> waterfront. It received a $2,000 (today $) bequest from the estate of New Orleans philanthropist <a href="Judah%20Touro">Judah Touro</a>, and used it to purchase a lot on Second Street, but did not feel financially secure enough to build a synagogue, and eventually sold the property. The congregation instead held services in members' homes in 1853, and subsequently (until 1857) rented various premises on Front Street. The Touro funds eventually enabled the members to lease the Farmers and Merchants Bank building at Main and Exchange streets in late 1857, which they converted to a synagogue. Funds for the renovation were raised by two committees; one solicited donations from "all the Israelites in this city", while the other's task was "to receive subscriptions from Gentiles". Additional funds were raised by selling members reserved seats in the new sanctuary. An auction was held on , 1858, in which 50 men's seats were sold for $343 (today $), and 44 women's' seats for $158 (today $). The renovated premises had seating for 150 men and approximately 50 women. In 1860, the congregation contracted to purchase the property; by 1865, it owned it outright and was debt-free. On , 2007, 153 years to the day after the congregation received its charter from the State of Tennessee, a historical marker was erected by the Shelby County Historical Commission, the <a href="Jewish%20American%20Society%20for%20Historic%20Preservation">Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation</a>, and Temple Israel, on the corner where the synagogue had once stood. It described the building as the "First Permanent Jewish House of Worship in Tennessee".

Membership in B'nai Israel was restricted to men, and attendance at the (at least) quarterly meetings was mandatory. Men who missed a meeting without a reasonable excuse were fined. The members also instituted rules intended to guard the image of the small Jewish congregation in the eyes of the much larger Christian community. New members had to be approved by a secret ballot, and existing members could <a href="Blackballing">blackball</a> candidates. A member could also be suspended or expelled if he acted in a disreputable manner.

B'nai Israel was the only Jewish congregation in Memphis, and from the time it was established members were split between traditionalists and reformers. When remodeling their new building, the congregation voted eighteen to fourteen to maintain traditional <a href="mechitza">separate seating for men and women</a>. By 1858, with enough funds to hire a full-time spiritual leader, they consulted Rabbi <a href="Isaac%20Leeser">Isaac Leeser</a>, the leader of America's Orthodox Jewish community, but were also in contact with Rabbi <a href="Isaac%20Mayer%20Wise">Isaac Mayer Wise</a>, the leader of America's fledgling Reform movement, who had dedicated B'nai Israel's sanctuary earlier that year. The members had advertised for their first spiritual leader in Wise's newspaper, "<a href="The%20American%20Israelite">The Israelite</a>" (along with other English-language Jewish newspapers) at the same time they advertised for a kosher butcher. Leeser recommended Jacob J. Peres, an Orthodox rabbi.

Born and raised in the Netherlands, Peres had been a child prodigy who, before turning eighteen, had edited a Hebrew grammar, as well as a volume of proverbs written in five languages. Upon graduation from high school, he had been given a <a href="stipend">stipend</a> by <a href="William%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI%20of%20the%20Netherlands">William I of the Netherlands</a> to attend the Netherlands Israelitish Seminary, where he pursued both secular and rabbinic studies. He was well-versed in mathematics, language, literature and law, and co-founded Peres and Micou, a legal firm.

B'nai Israel hired Peres in December 1858 as cantor and teacher, in English and German, at an annual salary of $600 (today $) with perquisites of $400. By comparison, the kosher butcher's salary was $300, not including what he earned killing poultry. Peres also ran the Hebrew school and the choir, and was in effect the rabbi. Under his leadership, the membership took a serious interest in the plight of Jews around the world. For example, at a congregational meeting in , they gathered money from the members present and B'nai Israel's treasury to assist suffering <a href="Moroccan%20Jews">Moroccan Jews</a>, and created a committee to raise funds throughout Memphis on their behalf. The congregation also moved more towards Orthodoxy, and passed a rule stating that only those members who were <a href="Shomer%20Shabbat">Sabbath observant</a> could receive <a href="Torah%20reading%23Procedure">Torah honors</a> on the High Holy Days.

Peres did not find his wages sufficient to support himself, his wife, and his four children. To supplement his income, he opened a grocery store and a <a href="Commission%20%28remuneration%29">commission</a> business (selling others' goods on <a href="consignment">consignment</a>) with his brother. As Saturday (the <a href="Shabbat">Jewish Sabbath</a>) was also the busiest day for commerce, he decided to keep his business open on that day—something forbidden by <a href="Rabbinically%20prohibited%20activities%20of%20Shabbat%23Money">Jewish law</a>, and at odds with the rule he had championed. Some of congregants objected, and at B'nai Israel's quarterly meeting, charges were brought against him; at a subsequent trial at a <a href="Beth%20din">Jewish court</a>, he was convicted and fired. In response, he sued the congregation in a civil court for lost wages and libel. The precedent-setting case, which reached the <a href="Tennessee%20Supreme%20Court">Tennessee Supreme Court</a>, was decided in his favor as regards the lost income, but against him regarding libel. The court's ruling was that "a religious institution is sovereign; that its laws and regulations are supreme; and that its policies and practices may not be challenged by a legal action in a court of law". In a letter to Rabbi Isaac Leeser in 1862, Peres claimed that he had been framed and that the store was actually run by his brother, just under his name. He writes that the synagogue had accused him of opening on the Sabbath "in order to get rid of me".

After Peres's dismissal, the members began a search for what they called a "Moderate Reform" rabbi. This time, they consulted Wise, not Leeser. The position was advertised in Wise's newspaper as a "Teacher, Preacher, and Reader", paying $1,000 (today $) per year. Qualifications included the ability to "instruct children in Hebrew, lecture once a week in German or English and read the Prayers properly". In 1860, they hired Simon Tuska. Peres stayed in Memphis, and the theological tensions within the congregation were resolved when forty of the more traditional members departed; with Peres as their spiritual leader, they formed the Orthodox <a href="Anshei%20Sphard%20Beth%20El%20Emeth%20Congregation">Beth El Emeth</a> congregation in the early 1860s. This division process was common to many American congregations of the time.

Born in <a href="Veszpr%C3%A9m">Veszprém</a>, Hungary in 1835, Tuska was raised in Rochester, New York, where his father was a rabbi. Simon attended the <a href="Colgate%20Rochester%20Crozer%20Divinity%20School">Rochester Theological Seminary</a>, and upon completion of his studies there in 1858, was sent to the <a href="Jewish%20Theological%20Seminary%20of%20Breslau">Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau</a> to get rabbinic training. He did not graduate from the seminary, instead returning to the United States in 1860 to apply for a position at <a href="Congregation%20Emanu-El%20of%20New%20York">Congregation Emanu-El of New York</a>, but he was turned down because of his small size and weak voice. He then applied to Temple Israel, where on , 1860, he was unanimously elected and signed a three-year contract at $800 (today $) per year. He proved to be very popular with the congregation; in , six months before the three-year contract was up for renewal, he was re-elected as rabbi for a ten-year term, and his salary rose to $1,500 per year.

Tuska reformed services at B'nai Israel, removing "<a href="piyyut">piyyut</a>im" (liturgical poems) in 1861, adding an organ and mixed-gender choir in 1862, and <a href="Confirmation%23Judaism">confirmation ceremonies</a> in 1863. He also shortened the <a href="siddur">prayer book</a> (adopting Wise's "<a href="Minhag%20America">Minhag America</a>" version), added a late Friday night service, and created patriotically themed services for <a href="Thanksgiving%20%28United%20States%29">Thanksgiving</a> and <a href="National%20Fast%20Day">National Fast Day</a>. When more pews were required to accommodate the worshipers, they were first added to the men's and women's sections, then family pews were added where men and women could sit together. In , as rabbi of B'nai Israel, he officiated at what may have been the first Jewish wedding in Tennessee; until that year, Tennessee did not authorize rabbis to perform marriages. He was also involved in the broader Memphis community, and participated in interfaith services.

Tuska supported slavery, describing the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> views of <a href="Henry%20Ward%20Beecher">Henry Ward Beecher</a> and others as "rabid", and like most members of B'nai Israel, after hostilities broke out between the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> and the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>, he supported <a href="Tennessee%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War%23Tennessee%20secedes">secession from the Union</a>. More than ten members of the congregation volunteered for the Confederate Army after war broke out, and they were given special honors and blessings at a ceremony during Sabbath services. Many Memphis schools were forced to close because of the Civil War; in response, B'nai Israel established the Hebrew Educational Institute in 1864. A secular school, it had 100 students, and taught English, Hebrew, German, and French as well as geography and music. Tuska was one of the school's language teachers. Insufficient funding forced its closure in 1868.

B'nai Israel had 83 members in 1864. The mortgage on the synagogue building had been paid off by 1865, but by 1867 the synagogue's expenses were exceeding its income. Dues were raised to $4 (today $) per member per month, and the congregation took out a new mortgage. In , the congregation moved Friday night services to ; previously the services had been held just after sunset, in accordance with Jewish law, which had meant late-night services in mid-summer, and late-afternoon services in mid-winter. (Several years later High Holy Day services were moved to the same time). That year Tuska began giving his Friday night sermons in English, rather than German. At the end of 1870, Tuska died of a heart attack.

In 1871, the congregation, whose membership by this time had reached 100, elected Max Samfield to succeed Tuska. The son of a rabbi, he was born in 1846 in <a href="Marktsteft">Marktsteft</a>, Bavaria, and was ordained in Germany. He left for the United States in 1867 to be rabbi of B'nai Zion Congregation of Shreveport, Louisiana, where he served for four years. He had significant competition for the role at B'nai Israel, with at least ten rabbis applying. Samfield had, however, preached there the Sabbath before the election for rabbi, and was hired for a one-year term. A strong proponent of Reform Judaism, he was associated with Wise in founding the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now <a href="Union%20for%20Reform%20Judaism">Union for Reform Judaism</a>), and under his leadership, B'nai Israel became one of its founding members in 1873. He was also president of the Board of Governors of <a href="Hebrew%20Union%20College">Hebrew Union College</a> (HUC) in <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>, and was supervisor of the <a href="Central%20Conference%20of%20American%20Rabbis">Central Conference of American Rabbis</a>. In 1875, he asked the congregation if he could abandon wearing the traditional <a href="kippah">head covering</a> while leading the prayers; in response, the members resolved that "all" men would be required to remove their hats during services. He led the congregation to adopt the Reform movement's new "<a href="Union%20Prayer%20Book">Union Prayer Book</a>" in 1896, but resisted moving Sabbath services to Sunday. Like most Reform rabbis at that time, he was strongly <a href="Anti-Zionism">anti-Zionist</a>, writing that <a href="Zionism">Zionism</a> was "an abnormal eruption of perverted sentiment".
A <a href="Grand%20Lodge%20of%20Scotland">Scottish Mason</a>, Samfield was committed to public service. When Tennessee's first Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Children was formed in 1880, he became its first vice-president, and in 1889, he led the fundraising for Memphis's first civilian hospital, <a href="St.%20Joseph%27s%20Hospital%20%28Memphis%2C%20Tennessee%29">St. Joseph's</a>, a Catholic institution. He founded Memphis's Hebrew Relief Association, and the non-sectarian United Charities, and was a director of the New Orleans Jewish Orphans' Home, Denver's Jewish Consumptive House, and New York's Sheltering House Association. For the last fifteen years of his life he worked to create a home for elderly and infirm Southern Jews, completed in 1927.

During Memphis's 1873 <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a> epidemic, he—along with other Memphis rabbis and leading Jews—remained in the city rather than fleeing. During the seven weeks the epidemic lasted, 51 people were buried in B'nai Israel's cemetery, almost twice the number typically buried there in a whole year. When another yellow fever epidemic broke out in 1878, Samfield stayed again, ministering to the dead and dying of all faiths. During that epidemic 78 people were buried in the congregation's cemetery. The city's frequent yellow fever epidemics decimated its Jewish community, which dropped from 2,100 to 300. They also hurt B'nai Israel's finances; members did not pay their dues, and for a time the congregation could not afford to pay Samfield. By 1880, however, membership had increased to 124 families, and finances had improved. By this time, the synagogue was more typically called Children of Israel. Beth El Emeth was affected more severely than Children of Israel by the epidemics; its rabbi (Peres) died of yellow fever in 1879. In 1882, Beth El Emeth disbanded, and transferred its property to Children of Israel, though most Beth El Emeth members joined the Orthodox <a href="Baron%20Hirsch%20Synagogue">Baron Hirsch Synagogue</a>. The property included land on Second Street, and Beth El Emeth's cemetery.

In 1872, Children of Israel purchased land on Adams Avenue, with the intent of building a new synagogue there, but financial pressures delayed the project, and in 1880 the congregation decided to sell the property and find a better one. They sold the lot in 1882, and instead purchased land on Poplar Avenue between Second and Third Streets. By 1884, they had completed a new synagogue building there, at a cost of $39,130 (today $). The <a href="Byzantine%20Revival%20architecture">Byzantine Revival</a> structure had an impressive façade featuring twin tall spires and a large round window containing a <a href="Star%20of%20David">Star of David</a>. The building helped attract new members; by 1885 an additional 45 had joined, for a total of 173 member families, and the congregation was again debt-free. That year, the synagogue acquired a cemetery on Hernando Road.

Though the congregation continued to grow, most new Jewish immigrants to Memphis were from Eastern Europe, and more traditional than the members of Children of Israel. As a result, they typically formed their own Orthodox synagogues, the oldest and longest-lasting of which was the Baron Hirsch Synagogue. Members of Children of Israel worked to assist the Eastern European Jews in assimilating into American society, providing financial assistance, free education on topics such as English, civics, and even hygiene, and from 1897 to 1907 they held a Sunday School for children of the Baron Hirsch congregation. In 1890, the membership of Children of Israel was 186 families, and the religious school had 148 students. To deal with persistent financial issues and attract younger members, in 1897 the congregation created a new class of member, the "seatholder", who could not be elected to any office, but paid less in return. This innovation was successful; 47 new members joined in 1898, and the congregation's total membership reached 222 families. Combined with cost cuts in other areas (primarily reducing the amount paid to the choir), this pulled the synagogue out of a four-year financial deficit.

At the end of the nineteenth century, the synagogue's annual revenues were $7,500 (today $). Around this time the congregation stopped hiring cantors, relying instead on the organist and choir to lead prayer-singing. By 1905, congregational membership had increased to 262, and by 1907 it was 285, and the synagogue's annual revenues were $8,500. The congregational school, which held classes once a week, had fifteen teachers and 220 students. That year the congregation added 56 seats to the sanctuary, primarily to handle the increased attendance on the High Holy Days. Despite the congregation's growth and the expansion of the sanctuary, attendance at regular services was sparse, particularly on Friday nights. From 1892 onward, Samfield publicly admonished the members for their poor Sabbath attendance, and in 1907, he insisted that board members attend Friday night services. The board agreed on condition that Samfield ensured his sermons were no longer than 25 minutes. Notwithstanding these issues, in 1904 Children of Israel purchased him a house, and in 1910 voted him "rabbi for life", at an annual salary of $4,200 (today $). That year membership reached 305 families. In , William H. "Bill" Fineshriber became the congregation's first associate rabbi. By 1912, the congregation had again grown too large for its building. Family membership was now 340, and the religious school had 260 children enrolled. The congregation acquired land on Poplar Avenue at Montgomery Street, east of their existing location, and began constructing a new synagogue there.

In addition to his other activities, in 1885 Samfield founded "The Jewish Spectator", a weekly journal on Southern Jewish life and culture. He was its editor until his death in , just days before his planned retirement. His death was announced with banner headlines, and to commemorate his passing, Memphis's streetcars were stopped for ten minutes.

Fineshriber succeeded Samfield in 1915. Born in <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>, in 1878, his father had been a Reform rabbi, who died at the age of 37. When Fineshriber was 13, he moved to Cincinnati on his own, where he attended high school. After graduating, he attended the <a href="University%20of%20Cincinnati">University of Cincinnati</a> and entered HUC's eight-year program. By 1900 he had graduated from both and been ordained. He accepted his first pulpit that year at <a href="Temple%20Emanuel%20%28Davenport%2C%20Iowa%29">Temple Emanuel</a> in Davenport, Iowa, and joined Children of Israel in 1911 as associate rabbi. He was the synagogue's first HUC graduate, and its first American-born rabbi. He had a quick wit, and was able to speak eloquently and extemporaneously on almost any topic. Often quoted in the newspapers, he was active in the Memphis community, and was a <a href="Rotary%20International">Rotarian</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Arabic%20Order%20of%20the%20Nobles%20of%20the%20Mystic%20Shrine">Shriner</a>, and <a href="Freemasonry">Freemason</a>. He was also an early suffragist, and took up the cause at Children of Israel. At a 1913 women's day event, featuring speakers from Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee, he was the only male speaker. At a 1914 rally he stated "Taxation without representation is tyranny ... [The] purpose of this meeting ... is to shock the people of Memphis into a realization that the question of equal suffrage is not child's play."

He spoke out strongly against the <a href="lynching%20of%20Ell%20Persons">lynching of Ell Persons</a> in 1917. Persons, a black man accused of raping and decapitating a sixteen-year-old white girl, had been burned alive in front of a crowd of thousands in Memphis, and his remains dismembered, scattered, and displayed. Fineshriber called a congregational meeting to protest the lynching, convinced the membership to endorse a public condemnation of it, and acted as secretary to a group of clergymen who issued a statement decrying the practice. He also convinced the editor of Memphis's largest newspaper, "<a href="The%20Commercial%20Appeal">The Commercial Appeal</a>", to write an editorial criticizing the lynching. Fineshriber supported other causes affecting African-Americans; he worked to improve their housing, spoke at black churches, and helped raise funds for them. He criticized the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> from his pulpit, the only clergyman in Memphis to do so. In 1921 he publicized his intention to "preach on the Ku Klux Klan" at Children of Israel at an event that, it was hoped, would attract many non-members. The Klan had re-organized in Memphis that year, and less than a month after Fineshriber's speech, marched publicly in Nashville's <a href="Armistice%20Day">Armistice Day</a> parade. Despite threats against him, his wife, and children, Fineshriber continued to preach against the Klan at the temple and other venues.

In 1922, in response to the attempt by <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> and his followers to ban the teaching of <a href="evolution">evolution</a> in universities and public schools, Fineshriber devoted three Friday night sermons to discussing it. He emphasized to packed audiences the "inalienable right of free thought and free speech, guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States", and argued that "[t]he majority of thoughtful and liberal preachers of the world have found no difficulty in accepting the theory of evolution without discarding their Bibles or their religion. You can worship God only in the light of truth". Nevertheless, in 1925 Tennessee became the first state to <a href="Butler%20Act">ban the teaching of evolution</a> in public schools, a law not repealed until 1967.

During Fineshriber's early years the congregation continued to modify its religious practices. At funerals, it encouraged mourners to leave the graveside, rather than having them wait until the coffin was lowered and cover it with earth themselves (as was the traditional practice). By this time, few members had <a href="bar%20mitzvah">bar mitzvah</a> ceremonies for their 13-year-old boys; instead, boys and girls participated in the Reform Confirmation ceremony (though the synagogue still allowed those who wanted bar mitzvah ceremonies to have them). In 1916, the congregation eliminated the observance of the eighth days of <a href="Passover">Passover</a> and <a href="Sukkot">Sukkot</a>, required all worshipers to stand when mourners stood to recite the "<a href="kaddish">kaddish</a>", and restored the Orthodox practice of blessing and naming babies in the synagogue as part of the services.

Children of Israel dedicated its new synagogue building in 1916. Designed by local architects Walk C. Jones, Sr. and Max Furbringer, it featured a large central dome and two smaller flanking domes, and was designed to resemble Istanbul's <a href="Hagia%20Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a>. Entrance was through three sets of double-doors, and carved into the <a href="entablature">entablature</a> was the biblical verse fragment (). The building's sanctuary seated 1,200, and had a huge $10,000 (today $) organ. The money for the latter had been raised by the recently formed Ladies Auxiliary, whose most effective fund-raising activity involved selling home-cooked meals. The building also had an auditorium with a stage, and fourteen classrooms for the religious school. Children of Israel's vacated building was purchased by a new Orthodox congregation that had adopted the name of the disbanded Beth El Emeth.

After the United States entered World War I in 1917, 131 men from Children of Israel enlisted or were drafted; one was killed. By 1919, the congregation's family membership had reached 450, and the synagogue's annual revenues were $18,000 (today $). The congregational school, which still held classes once a week, had 14 teachers and 388 students. The following year, women were given the right to vote at all congregational meetings. Fineshriber left in 1924 to become head rabbi of Congregation Keneseth Israel in Philadelphia. During his tenure, Children of Israel's membership doubled, and the religious school grew from 100 to 550 students. He died in 1968, and is the congregation's only deceased senior rabbi not buried in its cemetery.

Harry William Ettelson succeeded Fineshriber in 1925, the first Southerner to lead the congregation. Born in 1883, he was raised in <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a>. He had a B.A. from the University of Cincinnati (graduating in 1900 when he was seventeen), an M.A. from the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, and a Ph.D. from <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>. Ordained at HUC in 1904, he first served <a href="Congregation%20Achduth%20Vesholom">Congregation Achduth Vesholom</a> in Fort Wayne, Indiana, from 1904 to 1910, then <a href="Congregation%20Beth%20Israel%20%28West%20Hartford%2C%20Connecticut%29">Congregation Beth Israel</a> of Hartford, Connecticut, from 1911 to 1919. From 1919 to 1925 he was associate rabbi, then head rabbi at <a href="Congregation%20Rodeph%20Shalom%20%28Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania%29">Congregation Rodeph Shalom</a> in Philadelphia.

Ettelson was a strong supporter of the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Platform">Pittsburgh Platform</a> and its principles, which became the basis for what was later known as "classical" Reform Judaism. The services he led reflected that: member participation in the services (which were mostly in English) was limited. While at Achduth Vesholom he moved services from Saturday to Sunday for a period, in an attempt to improve attendance. Even before his joining Children of Israel, the congregation had already substantially reformed its services; it no longer held bar mitzvahs, observed the laws of "<a href="kashrut">kashrut</a>", or allowed congregants to participate in the <a href="Torah%20reading">Torah reading</a>. Aside from the "<a href="Shema%20Yisrael">Shema Yisrael</a>" and "<a href="Kaddish">Kaddish</a>", Hebrew or Aramaic prayers had been almost totally eliminated. Though he made few ritual changes himself, Ettelson continued this tradition, and emphasized community service over ritual practice, promoting Judaism as a universalist religion with a mission of justice and peace. The year he arrived he organized the Cross Cut Club, an inter-faith group intended to counter religious prejudice. He served as its first president, and was its president again in 1950. One of his initiatives there was the Union Civic Thanksgiving Service, an interdenominational eve-of-Thanksgiving service that was held for a number of years. In the 1930s it held an <a href="Racial%20integration">integrated</a> meeting, and, as a result, was not invited back to the venue the following year.

When Ettelson joined the congregation, it had 650 member families. To accommodate growth, in 1926 the synagogue built an annex for the children's religious school. That year the congregation also established the "Temple Men's Club", which had over 200 members, and joined the National Federation of Temple Brotherhoods. In 1928, the congregation purchased an adjoining house south of the synagogue, for Junior Congregation meetings, and began broadcasting its Friday evening services on the radio. The costs for both endeavors were donated anonymously by synagogue member Abe Plough, founder and chairman of <a href="Schering-Plough">Schering-Plough</a>. The synagogue was hard-hit by the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. Income from dues dropped from $47,000 in 1928 (today $) to $23,000 in 1932, and membership fell from 750 families in 1929 to as low as 629 families. The <a href="Talmud%20Torah">Talmud Torah</a> was closed due to lack of funds, and board meetings focused on finding ways to keep the congregation going financially. Ettelson requested a pay reduction of $1,000 (today $) in 1931, and a further 10 percent cut in 1933, and the salaries of other synagogue employees were also cut. The Junior Congregation did well, though; it had 189 paid members by 1933, held Saturday morning and High Holy Days services, and conducted a number of other programs. The congregation eventually recovered as a whole, assisted by members who were leaders in the civic and business worlds. By 1936, membership had increased to 650, and the synagogue paid off the remaining mortgage on the Poplar and Montgomery synagogue building.
In 1932, Ettelson became locally famous for a debate he had at Nashville's <a href="Ellis%20Auditorium">Ellis Auditorium</a> with Scopes Trial lawyer <a href="Clarence%20Darrow">Clarence Darrow</a> on whether or not religion was necessary. Ettelson argued in favor, Darrow against. Friction between Ettelson and some board members came to a head in 1937, when the board discussed the issue of whether to retain him as rabbi; when invited to the meeting, he spoke briefly, then resigned. The board recommended that his tenure be put to a congregational vote at the next annual meeting, where he was re-elected in a secret ballot by a vote of 303 to 31. He took an eight-month medical leave in 1938, and Children of Israel hired Morton Cohn as assistant rabbi.

The congregation was heavily involved in World War II, with many members serving in the armed forces, including Dudley Weinberg, who had succeeded Cohn as assistant rabbi. Children of Israel published a special newsletter for overseas members; by the end of the war, approximately four hundred congregants had served—and fourteen had died—in the U.S. military. As with many other Reform congregations, the members of Temple Israel were split on the issue of Zionism. It is likely that a majority were anti-Zionist, and the synagogue president joined the anti-Zionist <a href="American%20Council%20for%20Judaism">American Council for Judaism</a>, though other prominent members supported Zionism, and still others were simply non-Zionist. Ettelson initially opposed Zionism, though he did not join the council. With the growth of <a href="antisemitism">antisemitism</a> inside and outside the United States, his views changed, and he was an early member of the local chapter of the Zionist United Palestine Appeal. Nevertheless, he successfully kept the issue from becoming divisive at the temple.

In 1943, the congregation changed its name to Temple Israel. Its membership grew rapidly, from 914 families in 1944 to over 1,100 by late 1949, together with an increase in the number of children in line with the post-war <a href="post%E2%80%93World%20War%20II%20baby%20boom">post–World War II baby boom</a>. In 1951 the temple added a new education building, which had 22 classrooms, offices, and a library. That year the congregation also updated the synagogue's kitchen, added air conditioning for the vestry and auditorium, and the same for the sanctuary in 1953. Ettelson retired the following year, and was succeeded as senior rabbi by James Wax.

Born in 1912, James Aaron "Jimmy" Wax was raised in <a href="Herculaneum%2C%20Missouri">Herculaneum, Missouri</a>, where his was usually the only Jewish family in town. While attending <a href="Washington%20University%20in%20St.%20Louis">Washington University in St. Louis</a>, he was inspired by Rabbi Ferdinand Isserman of Temple Israel of St. Louis to become a rabbi, as a means of achieving social justice. Because of financial constraints brought on by the Depression, Wax had to finish his undergraduate schooling at <a href="Southeast%20Missouri%20State%20University">Southeast Missouri State Teachers College</a>, where he graduated with a B.A. in 1935. Mentored by Isserman, he then applied to HUC. Because he had little background in Hebrew, he did intensive work in the language prior to and during his admission, and was eventually ordained and achieved a Master of Hebrew Letters degree there in 1941. Turned down as a U.S. <a href="Military%20Chaplain">military chaplain</a>, from 1941 to 1945 he served at United Hebrew Congregation in St. Louis, and at <a href="North%20Shore%20Congregation%20Israel">North Shore Congregation Israel</a> in Glencoe, Illinois. In 1946, he became assistant rabbi of Temple Israel, and in 1947 was promoted to associate rabbi. In the early 1950s he was twice elected president of the Memphis and Shelby County Mental Health Society. Upon Ettelson's retirement in 1954, Wax became senior rabbi.
By this time the synagogue had around 1,200 member families, and over 600 children in its religious school. Wax initiated some changes in the congregation's religious practices. One was to have a real ram's horn "<a href="shofar">shofar</a>" blown on <a href="Rosh%20Hashanah">Rosh Hashanah</a> starting in 1954, rather than the trumpet that had been used for a number of years. Under his leadership a number of members also started having bar mitzvah ceremonies for their children, though this did not become common until the 1970s. By the 1970s he had also added Hebrew classes to the religious school.

In 1955 he supported and raised funds for the creation of Memphis's first <a href="Conservative%20Judaism">Conservative</a> synagogue, Beth Sholom, so that Conservative Jews would have their own place to worship. By 1964, four assistant rabbis had succeeded Wax; Milton G. Miller, Robert Blinder, Sandford Seltzer, and Sylvin Wolf. That year Wax added Torah readings to the Friday evening service, and Temple Israel's board began purchasing <a href="State%20of%20Israel%20Bonds">State of Israel Bonds</a>; in the wake of the 1967 <a href="Six-Day%20War">Six-Day War</a>, the board resolved to buy Israel Bonds "to the maximum feasible extent". By 1970 Wax had introduced services to celebrate "<a href="Yom%20Ha%27atzmaut">Yom Ha'atzmaut</a>" and commemorate <a href="Yom%20HaShoah">Holocaust Remembrance Day</a>. Though he initially resisted the idea of having a cantor, he eventually accepted a limited role for one, and in 1971 Thomas Schwartz was hired as Temple Israel's first full-time cantor/musical director in 80 years. Schwartz's salary was not paid by the synagogue, but was instead paid privately by a group of its members. In 1978, Wax received the National Human Relations Award from the Memphis Round Table of the <a href="National%20Conference%20of%20Christians%20and%20Jews">National Conference of Christians and Jews</a>. He retired a few weeks later, though he served as acting rabbi of Temple Beth El in Helena, Arkansas, visiting regularly from 1978 until his death in 1989.

The <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> sparked extremist antisemitism in the South, and "Communist Jews" were blamed for destroying democracy following the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court's</a> decision in "<a href="Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a>". Southern Jews found themselves in a difficult position; they were a vulnerable minority whose status in Southern white society was marginal and conditional on their acceptance of the status quo. Because of these concerns, particularly after the 1958 <a href="bombing%20of%20the%20Hebrew%20Benevolent%20Congregation%20Temple">bombing of the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Temple</a> in Atlanta, the congregation did not want Wax taking a public stand on civil rights. In addition, though Wax supported racial integration, not all his congregants did; according to Wax, "Almost all native-born Southerners whose families lived in the South for two or more generations have segregationist attitudes." Rather than getting involved in public protests, Wax worked with groups supporting integration, such as the Memphis Ministers Association. He also encouraged Temple Israel's members to join groups like the Panel of American Women, an interfaith and inter-racial group that spoke in favor of religious and racial tolerance at community events and whose Memphis chapter was founded by congregation member <a href="Jocelyn%20Wurzburg">Jocelyn Wurzburg</a>. Temple Israel member Myra Dreifus co-founded Memphis's Fund for Needy Schoolchildren in the 1960s. It helped provide food for hungry schoolchildren, primarily in black schools, and later expanded its efforts to include the distribution of free or discounted clothing and footwear. The group had both white and black women as members, including members of Temple Israel, and because of Dreifus's role in the Fund, Temple Israel itself supported it. By 1968, members of the Sisterhood were donating money so that tutors could be bussed to the majority African-American Kansas Street School. According to professor of women's and gender studies Kimberly K. Little, this "marked the first occasion where Temple Israel opened its doors to community–based programs; its prior charitable work focused on Jewish community outreach".

Wax was particularly involved with Memphis Committee on Community Relations (MCCR). The MCCR was formed in 1958 by a group of Memphis city leaders, with a goal of ending segregation in a non-violent way. Individual committees worked to desegregate various public facilities in Memphis. The MCCR also worked to get blacks representation in government (both elected and appointed officials), and created programs to improve economic conditions and job opportunities for blacks. Wax served as the MCCR's secretary from its formation until its dissolution in the 1970s. Several other Temple Israel members worked with the MCCR, and, as owners of large Memphis companies, were able to implement desegregation in their own workplaces. Other Temple Israel members supported the civil rights movement: senior business executives convinced stores to hire black salespeople, Herschel Feibelman chaired the Memphis War on Poverty Committee, and Marvin Ratner left a partnership at a prominent local law firm to form, along with two white and two black lawyers, Memphis's first integrated law firm.

In January 1965, Memphis mayor William B. Ingram asked Wax to join his Community Action Committee, a group that tried to get federal funding for <a href="poverty%20reduction">anti-poverty program</a>s and job training for black youths. In August of that year, Wax became chair of its policy committee, a mostly black group. Though the committee created a number of helpful programs, disagreement over the mayor's role in choosing members and controlling funds led to the group's dissolution in . Ingram lauded Wax's efforts on behalf of the group. Wax was also active in other civil rights groups, including the Tennessee Council on Human Relations, the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, the Memphis Urban League, and the Program of Progress, a group that worked to reform local government. He was elected president of the Memphis Ministers Association in , even though he was its only Jewish member.

On January 31, 1968, two Memphis sanitation workers were crushed to death in a malfunctioning garbage compactor, prompting the start of the <a href="Memphis%20Sanitation%20Strike">Memphis Sanitation Strike</a> on . The mostly black sanitation workers were Memphis's lowest paid civil servants, and received no overtime or holiday pay. Memphis's mayor was now <a href="Henry%20Loeb">Henry Loeb</a>, a former member of Temple Israel, who converted to Christianity soon after starting his term in 1968, after marrying an Episcopalian woman. He refused to negotiate with the workers, and the strike soon came to national attention as a civil rights issue. After being contacted by black ministers, Wax arranged a meeting on between Loeb, local union leaders, and <a href="Jerome%20Wurf">Jerry Wurf</a>, head of the <a href="American%20Federation%20of%20State%2C%20County%20and%20Municipal%20Employees">American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees</a>. The talks, which continued until on the 19th, and resumed later that day, resolved nothing. Temple Israel member Dreifus used her past support for Loeb in his 1967 mayoralty campaign as a means of trying to force him to resolve the strike, and act as a representative of both white and black Memphians. The strike continued through March. In an attempt to defuse tension, Wax called a meeting of Memphis's two clergy groups, the mostly white Memphis Ministers Association and the black Interdenominational Alliance for . The meeting, if anything, had the opposite effect; the black ministers wanted to march immediately on the mayor's office, while most of the white clergy, including Wax, refused to join the march, which they argued would just inflame the white public.

<a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> was assassinated in Memphis the next night. The Memphis Ministers Association organized a memorial service for King on the 5th. At the service, the ministers voted to march to Loeb's office that day and insist he address the workers' grievances and end the strike; led by Wax and William Dimmick, the dean of St. Mary's Cathedral, 250 clergymen marched in pairs to Loeb's office, where he was urged in front of television cameras to end the strike. In his sermon at Temple Israel, Wax told the congregation: "This city shall witness a new spirit and the memory of this great prophet of our time shall be honored. There will be bigots and segregationists and the so-called respectable but unrighteous people who will resist. But in the scheme of history, God's will does prevail." The strike was settled on , with the sanitation workers getting union recognition and other benefits. The only remaining impediment was a recommended ten-cent-an-hour raise on , followed by another raise on . The city budget did not have the estimated $558,000 (today $) required to pay the workers. To resolve the impasse, Temple Israel member Abe Plough donated the shortfall anonymously.

By 1957 the synagogue sanctuary, which had been designed for 350 families, had become too small to accommodate Temple Israel's over 1,100 member families. In addition, since the 1950s Memphis's Jewish community had been steadily moving from the downtown, where Temple Israel's Poplar Avenue building was located, to the eastern suburbs; by 1957 over half of the members, and three-quarters of those with children in the congregational school, lived there. School attendance increased rapidly, and the student body soon outgrew its 1951 building. The school had to split attendance in 1959, with the younger children attending on Saturday and the older ones on Sunday, and by 1961, 780 children were enrolled. In the early 1960s, Temple Israel began holding weekday classes at Beth Sholom, which was closer to most members.

In 1963, Temple Israel drew up plans for a new building, and in 1964 purchased land on White Station Road. In 1966, the members voted against building there, as older members were attached to the existing building, and concerned about expenses, but by the early 1970s, the situation could no longer be ignored. Plough offered to donate one-quarter of the $4 million cost of a new building. The land on White Station Road was sold, and a property on East Massey Road was purchased; the congregation moved into the new building in . The old synagogue was sold to <a href="Mid-America%20Baptist%20Theological%20Seminary">Mid-America Baptist Theological Seminary</a>, which would occupy it for the next twenty years. The new building was designed by Francis Gassner of Gassner, Nathan and Partners, with <a href="Percival%20Goodman">Percival Goodman</a> as consulting architect. It was constructed of steel and masonry, which was used for both the exterior and interior, and had copper roofing. In the front, a glass covered garden entered into a two-story reception area, which led to a smaller foyer, and ultimately to the main sanctuary. It had 32 classrooms, and a 300-seat chapel, later named the Danziger Chapel in honor of rabbi Harry Danziger and his wife Jeanne. The "<a href="Eternal%20Light%23In%20Jewish%20tradition">ner tamid</a>", Torah ark doors, and <a href="Ten%20Commandments">Ten Commandments</a> wall decoration from the Poplar Road building were installed in the new chapel.

The sanctuary, which sat up to 1,500, was semi-circular in shape, and designed so that no worshiper was more than fifteen rows from the <a href="Torah%20ark">Torah ark</a>. It was lit by skylights, and had a balcony. Its ceiling, along with those of the entrance foyer and chapel, were of oak, as were the doors, trim, and paneling. The building's interior art work was designed by Efrem Weitzman, including the Torah ark, most ritual objects, stained glass, mosaics, and tapestries. In the architect's view, the compact design of the sanctuary, and the liberal use of stained glass and wood, "achieved the desired feelings of intimacy". On the same level as the balcony was a gallery, originally designed for art and Judaica exhibits. In 1994, upon the donation by Herta and Justin Adler of the Adler Judaica Collection, this became a permanent museum. The complex at 1376 East Massey Road had a final cost of (today $), of which Plough donated over . In gratitude for his donation, Plough was named honorary president for life.

In 2003, the congregation embarked on a significant renovation and expansion of its facility. Over of space, including the social hall, was renovated, and a early childhood and family center addition was built, creating a U-shaped wing around a courtyard. Architect Walt Reed of The Crump Firm said he kept the emphasis on "simple, geometric, contemporary forms" that existed in the original building, as well as using the same copper roofing and detailing materials. The approximately construction project took two years, and was completed in 2007. "Wings to the Heavens", <a href="David%20Ascalon">David Ascalon</a>'s -high, welded aluminum and stainless steel abstract <a href="Kinetic%20art%23Kinetic%20sculpture">kinetic sculpture</a>, was installed in the atrium.

Harry K. Danziger succeeded Wax as rabbi in 1978. The son of a rabbi, Danziger was a graduate of the University of Cincinnati, and ordained by the HUC. He joined Temple Israel as assistant rabbi in 1964, but in 1969 moved to Monroe, Louisiana, to lead Congregation B'nai Israel. He was replaced first by Howard Schwartz, then by Richard Birnholz. Birnholz tendered his resignation in 1973, and Wax began to think of retirement. Danziger, then at Baltimore's <a href="Temple%20Oheb%20Shalom%20%28Baltimore%2C%20Maryland%29">Temple Oheb Shalom</a>, was approached as Wax's successor, and returned to Temple Israel that year as associate rabbi. Synagogue membership had been around 1,350 families from the mid-1960s, but increased after the move to East Massey Road. By Wax's retirement it had reached around 1,500, and over half Memphis's 10,000 Jews were members of Temple Israel.

In his first sermon as associate rabbi, Danziger said "we can afford to look Jewish after all these years and ... out of self-respect alone, we cannot afford not to". As senior rabbi he slowly brought more traditional observances back to Temple Israel, moving it away from the radicalism of "Classical Reform" Judaism. These observances included the chanting of Torah blessings, a Torah procession through the sanctuary aisles, fasting on "Yom Kippur", <a href="brit%20milah">circumcising</a> baby boys, and saying the "kaddish" for the deceased. In 1979, he gradually replaced the old "Union Prayer Book" with the new "<a href="Gates%20of%20Prayer">Gates of Prayer</a>" <a href="siddur">prayer book</a>, and later began wearing a "<a href="tallit">tallit</a>" while on the "<a href="Bema%23Judaism">bimah</a>". The changes were not uncontroversial, and the latter prompted one member to resign in protest. Though more traditional than his more recent predecessors, he was willing to perform intermarriages, but also counseled the couples as to the meaning of making a Jewish home. Danziger was involved in the Central Conference of American Rabbis and eventually became its president.

John Kaplan joined as cantor in 1981, and made the services less formal and more interactive. His innovations included bringing in more modern tunes, encouraging congregational singing, and accompanying the services with a guitar, rather than the organ. By 2006, Friday night services included a "spirit" service, at which a <a href="house%20band">house band</a> played.
During Danziger's tenure, assistant rabbis included Alan Greenbaum (1977–1981), Harry Rosenfeld (1981–1984), Constance Abramson Golden—Temple Israel's first female rabbi—(1984–1986), and Marc Belgrad (1986–1991). Micah D. Greenstein, the son of rabbi Howard Greenstein, succeeded Belgrad as assistant rabbi in 1991, and was subsequently promoted to associate rabbi. A graduate of <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a> and the <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20School%20of%20Government">John F. Kennedy School of Government</a>, he was ordained by the HUC. On Danziger's retirement in 2000, he became senior rabbi. An advocate for social justice, he tried to convince the Shelby County Commission to pass a law forbidding discrimination against <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> people, and has used the Bible to present counter-arguments to those supporting such discrimination based on biblical verses. He has served twice as president of the Memphis Ministers Association, and sits on the boards of several local non-profit organizations.

Valerie Cohen joined as assistant rabbi in 1999, and served until 2003, before becoming rabbi of <a href="Beth%20Israel%20Congregation%20%28Jackson%2C%20Mississippi%29">Beth Israel Congregation</a> of Jackson, Mississippi. Adam B. Grossman, a graduate of <a href="Ohio%20State%20University">Ohio State</a> and <a href="Xavier%20University">Xavier</a> universities, and ordained at HUC, joined as assistant rabbi in . He had previously served as a rabbinic intern at Dayton, Ohio's <a href="Temple%20Israel%20%28Dayton%2C%20Ohio%29">Temple Israel</a>. Katie M. Bauman, a graduate of <a href="Washington%20University%20in%20St.%20Louis">Washington University in St. Louis</a>, and ordained at HUC, joined as assistant rabbi in . She had previously served in rabbinic roles in Natchez, Mississippi and Marion, Ohio, as a cantor in Cincinnati, Ohio's <a href="Rockdale%20Temple">Rockdale Temple</a>, and in 2003–2004, as Temple Israel's Artist and Educator in Residence.

Temple Israel experienced modest fluctuations in membership during the 1990s and 2000s, and approximately half the Jews attending services in Memphis worshiped there. In 1995, membership was over 1,700 family units, and by 2004, it had reached 1,800, and the religious school had 800 students. By 2008, the school (renamed the Wendy and <a href="Avron%20Fogelman">Avron Fogelman</a> Religious School) had 500 students, and by 2010 membership had fallen to under 1,600 families. It remained, nevertheless, the only Reform synagogue in Memphis, the largest and oldest synagogue in Tennessee, and one of the largest Reform synagogues in the United States. , Micah Greenstein is the senior rabbi, with Katie Bauman as associate rabbi, Harry Danziger as rabbi emeritus, and John Kaplan as cantor emeritus.

Ronnie Lee Gardner

Ronnie Lee Gardner (January 16, 1961 – June 18, 2010) was an American criminal who received the <a href="capital%20punishment">death penalty</a> for shooting a man in the face and killing him during a robbery in 1985, and was <a href="execution%20by%20firing%20squad">executed by a firing squad</a> by the state of <a href="Utah">Utah</a> in 2010. Gardner's case spent nearly 25 years in the court system, prompting the <a href="Utah%20House%20of%20Representatives">Utah House of Representatives</a> to introduce legislation to limit the number of appeals in capital cases.

In October 1984, Gardner killed Melvyn John Otterstrom during a robbery in <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City">Salt Lake City</a>. While being moved in April 1985 to a court hearing for the homicide, he fatally shot attorney Michael Burdell in an unsuccessful escape attempt. Convicted of two counts of murder, Gardner was sentenced to <a href="life%20imprisonment">life imprisonment</a> for the first count and received the death penalty for the second. The state adopted more stringent security measures as a result of the incident at the courthouse. While held at <a href="Utah%20State%20Prison">Utah State Prison</a>, Gardner was charged with another capital crime for stabbing an inmate in 1994. However, that charge was thrown out by the <a href="Utah%20Supreme%20Court">Utah Supreme Court</a> because the victim survived.

In a series of appeals, defense attorneys presented mitigating evidence of the troubled upbringing of Gardner, who had spent nearly his entire adult life in incarceration. His request for <a href="commutation%20of%20sentence">commutation of his death sentence</a> was denied in 2010 after the families of his victims testified against him. Gardner's legal team took the case all the way to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Supreme Court</a>, which declined to intervene.

The execution of Gardner at Utah State Prison became the focus of media attention in June 2010, because it was the first to be carried out by <a href="firing%20squad">firing squad</a> in the <a href="Capital%20punishment%20in%20the%20United%20States">United States</a> in 14 years. Gardner stated that he sought this method of execution because of his <a href="Mormon">Mormon</a> background. On the day before his execution, <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> released a statement clarifying its position on the issue of <a href="blood%20atonement">blood atonement</a> of individuals. The case also attracted <a href="capital%20punishment%20debate">debate over capital punishment</a> and whether Gardner had been destined for a life of violence since his difficult childhood.

Ronnie Lee Gardner was born in <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City">Salt Lake City</a>, <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, and was the youngest of Dan and Ruth Gardner's seven children. Dan was a heavy drinker who left the household to start another family while Ronnie was a toddler; Dan and Ruth divorced when Ronnie was 18 months old. Six months later, Ronnie was found malnourished and wandering the streets alone in a diaper. Child welfare workers filed a "failure to care" petition and took him into custody, though they later returned him to his mother. Gardner's relationship with his father was tumultuous; Dan did not believe he was Gardner's biological father and frequently told his son of his belief. According to Gardner, he was raised by an older sister, and was sexually abused by his siblings. Sometimes he and his sister Bonnie would run away and seek refuge in a "<a href="hobo">hobo</a> camp." By the age of 10, Gardner was addicted to drugs and permitted access to alcohol. He and his brother Randy were arrested for stealing <a href="cowboy%20boots">cowboy boots</a> and taken into <a href="juvenile%20detention">juvenile detention</a>. Gardner recalled with distress that his father Dan came to take his brother Randy home and left him behind.

Gardner's mother married Bill Lucas, who had been <a href="incarcerated">incarcerated</a> in <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a> in 1968. The Gardner-Lucas family eventually had nine children. Gardner admired Lucas, who used his stepsons as lookouts while burglarizing homes. By his early teens, Gardner had been held in detention at a series of institutions, including an <a href="involuntary%20commitment">involuntary commitment</a> at <a href="Utah%20State%20Hospital">Utah State Hospital</a> in <a href="Provo%2C%20Utah">Provo</a>. Gardner was small as a boy, and described that he had to fight to defend himself and earn respect. As Gardner admitted, "I was a nasty little bugger."

While held at <a href="Utah%20State%20Industrial%20School">Utah State Industrial School</a> in <a href="Ogden%2C%20Utah">Ogden</a>, Gardner was visited by Jack Statt, a man who was living with his brother Randy. According to Gardner, Statt met Randy at a bus stop and paid him $25 for <a href="oral%20sex">oral sex</a>. When released from the school in 1975, Gardner stayed with Statt. Although social workers noted the men in the household were dressed like women, Statt officially became a <a href="foster%20care">foster parent</a> to Gardner and his brother. Gardner said that Statt performed sex acts on them and explained, "I thought life like that was normal." Gardner stated in a psychological evaluation that he worked as a <a href="prostitute">prostitute</a> while living with Statt, who psychologists say fit the <a href="pedophilia">pedophile</a> profile. Gardner said his time in foster care was the most stable period of his life "Jack was a good man, and he tried to help us out."

While Gardner intermittently continued to go to the industrial school, he met Debra Bischoff at a Salt Lake City apartment complex where his mother lived. Bischoff described him as: "Very caring. He never put me in the rough situations he was in throughout his life. He sheltered me from that stuff." Gardner had a daughter in May 1977 and a son in February 1980 with Bischoff, but was convicted of robbery and sent to <a href="Utah%20State%20Prison">Utah State Prison</a> in the same month his son was born. Gardner successfully escaped the prison's <a href="Prison%23Security%20levels">maximum security</a> unit on April 19, 1981, and was shot in the neck while attempting to kill a man who he believed had raped Bischoff. In February 1983, he was identified as a ringleader in a disturbance in which inmates barricaded a cell block and started fires.

On August 6, 1984, Gardner escaped from custody at the <a href="University%20of%20Utah%20Hospital">University of Utah Hospital</a> after faking an illness by vomiting. He attacked transportation officer Don Leavitt and forced him to unlock his shackles by telling him: "I guess you know if that doctor comes back, I'll have to kill you both." In the course of the escape, Gardner struck Leavitt so hard that he needed wires to reconstruct his face. Gardner forced a medical student named Mike Lynch to take him from the premises on a motorcycle while pointing a gun into his back. On August 11, a letter carrier found Leavitt's firearm in a mailbox with a note from Gardner that said, "Here's the gun and wallet taken from the guard at the hospital. I don't want to hurt no one else. I just want to be free."

During the night of October 9, 1984, Gardner robbed the Cheers Tavern in Salt Lake City. While under the influence of <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a>, he shot bartender Melvyn John Otterstrom in the face, killing him. Otterstrom's cousin Craig Watson stated that the robbery "gained less than $100." Family members said Gardner attended Otterstrom's funeral and pretended to be a childhood friend. Following a tip, police apprehended Gardner three weeks later at the home of his cousin. Gardner said that the shooting occurred because Otterstrom put up a fight, but investigators did not find any evidence to support this claim. Gardner was held in custody in lieu of $1.5 million bail. His <a href="crime%20scene%20getaway">getaway driver</a> was identified as Darcy Perry McCoy, who testified against him.

During trial proceedings for the Otterstrom murder on April 2, 1985, Gardner attempted to escape from custody with a revolver smuggled into the <a href="Metropolitan%20Hall%20of%20Justice">Metropolitan Hall of Justice</a> at Salt Lake City. Jim Kleine of the Salt Lake City Fire Department believed that the gun was passed to Gardner as he was being escorted into the <a href="courthouse">courthouse</a> from the underground parking lot. Gardner was immediately shot in the chest by guard Luther Hensley. Gardner then wounded unarmed bailiff George "Nick" Kirk in the abdomen. After running to the courtroom archives, Gardner confronted attorneys Robert Macri and Michael Burdell. According to Macri, after Gardner pointed the gun at him, he changed aim to Burdell, who had been doing <a href="pro%20bono">pro bono</a> work for his church. Burdell yelled, "Oh, my God," then Gardner shot him in the eye. Gardner made his way outside the building, where he was surrounded by dozens of police officers. Gardner threw the gun away, dropped and yelled: "Don’t shoot, I don’t have a gun."

Gardner was taken to the <a href="University%20of%20Utah">University of Utah</a> Health Services Center where he was listed in <a href="serious%20condition">serious condition</a>, but recovered. Burdell died about 45 minutes later while in surgery at <a href="Salt%20Lake%20Regional%20Medical%20Center">Holy Cross Hospital</a>. Kirk survived surgery and was listed in <a href="critical%20condition">critical condition</a> at <a href="LDS%20Hospital">LDS Hospital</a>. During a search of the courthouse, a bag of men's clothing was found in the basement under a women's restroom sink. Prosecutor Bob Stott believed Gardner's gun had been taped to a water fountain on the first floor. Darcy Perry McCoy was found unarmed and was arrested about a mile away. Her sister, Carma Jolley Hainsworth, was sentenced to eight years in prison for delivering the clothes and messages in preparation for the escape attempt, but the identity of the person who provided Gardner with the firearm was not known at the time. State corrections director William Vickrey cleared the actions of the prison guards who escorted Gardner, but Salt Lake County Sheriff N.D. "Pete" Hayward said that the guard who shot Gardner should have kept shooting until Gardner was dead. A review found that the guards were inhibited from shooting because Gardner had been using a hostage as a <a href="human%20shield">human shield</a>. Sheriff Hayward said the escape attempt "appeared to be well-planned" and blamed the security breach on the layout of the Metropolitan Hall of Justice, which allowed unrestricted access to areas where prisoners were transported.

Otterstrom, a mountain climber and veteran of the 19th Special Forces Group of the Utah National Guard, was survived by his wife Kathy and his five-year-old son, Jason. Burdell  a Vietnam veteran, former engineer, and member of the <a href="Summum">Summum</a> Church  was survived by his girlfriend, Donna Nu, who would go on to advocate against Gardner's execution.

Gardner was diagnosed with <a href="antisocial%20personality%20disorder">antisocial personality disorder</a>. In June 1985, Gardner pleaded guilty to the murder of Otterstrom and received a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of <a href="parole%23United%20States">parole</a>. At one point, Gardner threatened to disrupt subsequent court hearings because he was upset over being required to wear a leg brace that would lock if he attempted to escape again. He was advised by guards that it would be to his benefit to behave in front of prospective jurors. District Judge Jay E. Banks instructed the jury, on October 22, 1985, that they had the option of a verdict for the lesser offense of <a href="manslaughter">manslaughter</a> if they found Gardner to be under mental or emotional <a href="duress">duress</a> when he shot Burdell. The jurors deliberated less than three hours and found Gardner guilty of capital murder. Ultimately sentenced to death, Gardner selected execution by firing squad over <a href="lethal%20injection">lethal injection</a>. Legislators in Utah eliminated the firing squad as a method of execution in 2004, but convicts who were sentenced before that date, such as Gardner, could still select that option. Since 1976, only two other people have been executed by firing squad in the United States, both in Utah: <a href="Gary%20Gilmore%20%28criminal%29">Gary Gilmore</a> and <a href="John%20Albert%20Taylor">John Albert Taylor</a>. In contrast to Taylor, who said he chose the firing squad to embarrass the state, Gardner's attorney said that his client did not want to attract attention and simply preferred to die this way.

Gardner's incarceration as Utah's then-youngest inmate on <a href="death%20row">death row</a> was not uneventful. A hearing was held on February 19, 1987, in which Gardner and other inmates claimed "unconstitutional confinement" in unsanitary conditions with poor food.
On October 28, 1987, Gardner broke a glass partition in a prison visiting area and had sex with a woman who was meeting him, while other inmates cheered and barricaded the doors. According to state prison spokesperson Juan Benavidez, though Gardner had "knocked out the lights", an officer who was in the control room "could still see what was going on." Gardner claimed breaking the glass was an accident. In 1993, <a href="Utah%20House%20of%20Representatives">Utah state representative</a> Dan Tuttle introduced what he called "the Ronnie Lee Gardner bill" in which he proposed that law enforcement officers be permitted to shoot inmates attempting to escape, whether they are "armed or not."
On September 25, 1994, Gardner got drunk from consuming alcohol, which he fermented in his own prison cell sink, and stabbed inmate Richard "Fats" Thomas with a <a href="Shiv%20%28weapon%29">shiv</a> fashioned from a pair of sunglasses. Thomas suffered nine puncture wounds to his face, mouth, arm and chest that were life-threatening, but made a full recovery. Though Thomas had survived the stabbing, Gardner was charged with another <a href="capital%20punishment">capital crime</a> under a 1974 Utah law reserved for prison attacks by first-degree felony inmates. There was no precedent in the United States for a death penalty that was carried out for such a crime. The constitutionality of the law was challenged, with defense lawyers calling it "stale and anachronistic," and the charge against Gardner was thrown out by the <a href="Utah%20Supreme%20Court">Utah Supreme Court</a> because the victim did not die.

In February 1996, Gardner threatened to sue to force the state of Utah to execute him by firing squad. He had told a judge in a 1991 hearing that he was motivated by his children to seek lethal injection, but later changed his mind as they became older. He said that he preferred the firing squad because of his "Mormon heritage." Gardner also felt that lawmakers were trying to eliminate the firing squad, in opposition to popular opinion in Utah, because of concern over the state's image in the upcoming <a href="2002%20Winter%20Olympics">2002 Winter Olympics</a>.

In 1998, the old Metropolitan Hall of Justice was vacated and replaced by the multimillion-dollar <a href="Scott%20M.%20Matheson%20%28Utah%20governor%29">Scott M. Matheson</a> Courthouse. Gardner's deadly escape attempt in 1985 was blamed on the open access and light security of the previous building and greatly influenced the tighter security measures adopted by Salt Lake City's new courthouse. Former prosecutor Kent Morgan stated, "Absolutely Gardner changed that." On March 3, 2001, the Metropolitan Hall of Justice was demolished.

In 2007, U.S. federal judge <a href="Tena%20Campbell">Tena Campbell</a> rejected Gardner's appeal that his attorneys were inadequate because they were unable to prove that he did not mean to kill his victim. The <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Tenth%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> rejected motions for appeal by his defense on March 8, 2010. Gardner attempted to give up the process at least three times, but his attorneys convinced him to continue appealing each time. State court Judge Robin Reese signed an <a href="execution%20warrant">execution warrant</a> on April 23 ordering the state to carry out the death sentence.

At Gardner's <a href="commutation%20of%20sentence">commutation</a> hearing on June 10, 2010, lawyers and medical experts in his defense argued whether <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a> contracted at the age of 4 had damaged his brain. Gardner had also <a href="inhalant%20abuse">huffed gas and glue</a> with his siblings, and played with <a href="mercury%20poisoning">mercury</a> stolen from gas meters by his stepfather to sell. Three of the jurors that sentenced Gardner to death signed an <a href="affidavit">affidavit</a> that they would have recommended life without parole, an option that was not available in Utah until 1992. Gardner claimed that he was a changed man who counseled other inmates and was interested in starting an <a href="organic%20farm">organic farm</a> project for youths on in <a href="Box%20Elder%20County%2C%20Utah">Box Elder County, Utah</a>. Gardner's attorney presented a letter his client wrote to <a href="Oprah%20Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> requesting funds for the project. Gardner also argued that it was not justifiable to execute him after so much time had passed since the crime.

Assistant state attorney general Tom Brunker argued against clemency, stating: "Mr. Gardner was sentenced to death and earned that death penalty because of his unflagging history of violent crime." The family of the late George "Nick" Kirk recounted how his being shot by Gardner affected their lives and ultimately shortened Kirk's life. Kirk's daughter Barb Webb said, "He's done a lot of horrific things in his past and I think, given the chance, he would do them all again." Jason Otterstrom, whose father Melvyn was murdered by Gardner, struggled to describe the impact upon his family. After listening to the testimony from the families of the victims, the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole declined Gardner's commutation request, stating that the jury's verdict and sentence were "not inappropriate." The board members cited his violent record during incarceration and questioned his effort to reform as being "too little, too late." Gardner revealed at the hearing that it was Darcy Perry McCoy who provided him the gun with which he murdered Michael Burdell. Deputy Salt Lake County attorney Bob Stott said that McCoy would not be prosecuted because Gardner, the only witness, was going to be executed.

The <a href="Utah%20Supreme%20Court">Utah Supreme Court</a> upheld lower court rulings on June 14, 2010, exhausting Gardner's appeals within the state. The U.S. Supreme Court turned down final appeals on June 17, though a court order indicated that dissenting Justices <a href="Stephen%20Breyer">Stephen Breyer</a> and <a href="John%20Paul%20Stevens">John Paul Stevens</a> would have granted a <a href="stay%20of%20execution">stay of execution</a>. Utah governor <a href="Gary%20Herbert">Gary Herbert</a> also declined to intervene because Gardner had "a full and fair opportunity" in court. State attorney general <a href="Mark%20Shurtleff">Mark Shurtleff</a> announced on <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> that he signed off on the execution: "I just gave the go ahead to Corrections Director to proceed with Gardner's execution."

<a href="Opposition%20to%20capital%20punishment%20in%20the%20United%20States">Opponents of capital punishment</a> gathered at the <a href="Utah%20State%20Capitol">Utah State Capitol</a> to hold a rally during the final appeals. The protest was attended by Gardner's family, and was organized by Utahans for Alternatives to the Death Penalty. The protest also included the support of Brian King of the <a href="Utah%20House%20of%20Representatives">Utah House of Representatives</a>, who pledged to urge the legislature to reconsider the use of the capital punishment. The family of murder victim Michael Burdell had also appealed on Gardner's behalf, stating that Burdell was a <a href="pacifism">pacifist</a> who would have opposed the death penalty.

News media arrived from around the world and raised the issue of <a href="blood%20atonement">blood atonement</a> because of Gardner's citation of his Mormon roots in selecting the firing squad. Some followers of <a href="Mormonism">Mormonism</a> were taught that murder is so heinous that the blood of the offender must be spilled to pay for their sins. On the day before Gardner's execution, <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> released the following statement:

In the mid-19th century, when rhetorical, emotional oratory was common, some church members and leaders used strong language that included notions of people making restitution for their sins by giving up their own lives.

However, so-called "<a href="blood%20atonement">blood atonement</a>," by which individuals would be required to shed their own blood to pay for their sins, is not a doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We believe in and teach the infinite and all-encompassing atonement of Jesus Christ, which makes forgiveness of sin and salvation possible for all people.
Other denominations voiced their opposition to the use of capital punishment. Reverend David Henry of the <a href="First%20Baptist%20Church%20of%20Salt%20Lake%20City">First Baptist Church of Salt Lake City</a> said, "Violence breeds violence ... . It doesn't work. It's ineffective, and it's brutalizing all of us." Cardinal <a href="Keith%20O%27Brien">Keith O'Brien</a> of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> later used Gardner's cases to describe the "culture of vengeance" in the United States.

According to polls, support for capital punishment had been steadily declining since the 1990s, but the majority of people in Utah still supported the death penalty in the period leading up to Gardner's scheduled execution. In 2010, Kay McIff of the Utah House of Representatives sponsored legislation to require condemned inmates to raise all appeal arguments in their first post-conviction petition, noting that Gardner's multiple appeals kept his case lingering on death row for nearly 25 years. The <a href="bill%20%28proposed%20law%29">bill</a>, HB202, passed the Utah House by a margin of 67-to-5 on February 1, 2011, and unanimously passed the <a href="Utah%20State%20Senate">Utah State Senate</a> on February 17. The legislation was signed into law by the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Utah">Governor</a> on 22 March 2011. The law denies any stay of execution after a first appeal, without a judicial review of new evidence (or a pregnant appellant), that a judge determines would have materially affected the original case.

The <a href="Utah%20Department%20of%20Corrections">Utah Department of Corrections</a> provided Gardner's attorney, Andrew Parnes, with documentation about executions by firing squad and lethal injection. The records included the Utah execution team's training and expertise. Parnes relayed the information to Gardner after agreeing not to disclose it to anyone else.

On June 15, 2010, Gardner ate a <a href="last%20meal">last meal</a> of steak, lobster tail, apple pie, vanilla ice cream and 7-Up, before beginning a 48-hour fast while watching <a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%20%28film%20series%29">"The Lord of the Rings" film trilogy</a> and reading "<a href="Divine%20Justice%20%28novel%29">Divine Justice</a>". According to his lawyers, the fast was motivated by "spiritual reasons." Gardner was visited by an <a href="Bishop%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">LDS bishop</a> and his family before his execution. Gardner walked voluntarily to his place of execution. When asked if he had any last words, he responded, "I do not, no."
Gardner was executed on June 18, 2010, at 12:15 am Mountain Daylight Time by a firing squad at Utah State Prison in <a href="Draper%2C%20Utah">Draper</a>. He was placed in restraints on a black metal chair with a hood covering his head. Sandbags were arranged around him to absorb ricochets. The firing squad was made up of five anonymous volunteers who were certified police officers. The officers stood about from Gardner, aiming at a white target positioned over his heart. One of their <a href=".30-30%20Winchester">.30-caliber Winchester</a> rifles was selected at random and loaded with a non-lethal <a href="wax%20bullet">wax bullet</a> so that they would not know with certainty who fired the fatal shots. According to the <a href="Utah%20Department%20of%20Corrections">Utah Department of Corrections</a>, the squad used a countdown <a href="Military%20cadence">cadence</a> beginning with five and simultaneously firing right before two. His dark blue jumpsuit made it difficult to see the blood from his wounds. A medical examiner removed Gardner's hood to reveal his lifeless face. After verifying Gardner's lack of pulse at the neck and <a href="pupillary%20light%20reflex">pupillary light reflex</a>, the medical examiner pronounced him dead at 12:17 am. He was the first person to be executed by firing squad in the United States since the execution of <a href="John%20Albert%20Taylor">John Albert Taylor</a> 14 years earlier. A <a href="commemorative%20coin">commemorative coin</a> was commissioned for prison staff who participated in the execution.
Gardner's friends and family gathered outside the prison at a <a href="candlelight%20vigil">candlelight vigil</a> while playing "<a href="Free%20Bird">Free Bird</a>" by <a href="Lynyrd%20Skynyrd">Lynyrd Skynyrd</a>. They did not witness his execution, per his request. Some wore shirts with his prisoner number 14873. His body was cremated and released to his daughter to be taken back to <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a> with family members.

2003 Cricket World Cup Final

The 2003 Cricket World Cup Final was a <a href="One%20Day%20International">One Day International</a> (ODI) match played between <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australia</a> and Indian National Cricket Team on 23 March 2003 at the <a href="Wanderers%20Stadium">Wanderers Stadium</a> in <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>, South Africa. It marked the culmination of the <a href="2003%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2003 Cricket World Cup</a>, the eighth edition of the tournament. It was the first time that these two teams had met at this stage of a World Cup. For defending champions Australia it was their fifth World Cup final, while for India it was the second after their <a href="1983%20Cricket%20World%20Cup%20Final">1983 victory</a>. Australia won the match by 125 <a href="Run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> to claim the title for the third time.

Both teams had progressed through three stages to reach the final. Australia was unbeaten thus far, while India had lost one game—against Australia in the first stage. Australia—led by <a href="Ricky%20Ponting">Ricky Ponting</a>—entered the game as firm favourites. After winning the <a href="Toss%20%28cricket%29">toss</a>, India captain <a href="Sourav%20Ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a> decided to field first before a crowd of nearly 32,000. The Australian opening pair, <a href="Adam%20Gilchrist">Adam Gilchrist</a> and <a href="Matthew%20Hayden">Matthew Hayden</a>, added 105 runs in 14 <a href="Over%20%28cricket%29">overs</a>. After their dismissals, Ponting (140 <a href="Not%20out%20%28cricket%29">not out</a>) and <a href="Damien%20Martyn">Damien Martyn</a> (88 not out) were involved in a <a href="Partnership%20%28cricket%29">partnership</a> of 234 runs, then an Australian record, and took the total to 359 runs at the end of the innings. <a href="Harbhajan%20Singh">Harbhajan Singh</a> took both of the Australian <a href="wickets">wickets</a>, conceding 49 runs.

In response, India lost their key batsman, <a href="Sachin%20Tendulkar">Sachin Tendulkar</a>, at the start of the innings. Despite a brief interruption by rain after the 17th over, no time was lost from the game. Once play resumed, India lost wickets at regular intervals. <a href="Virender%20Sehwag">Virender Sehwag</a> top-scored for India with 82 runs, before the team were bowled out for 234 runs in the 40th over. For Australia, <a href="Glenn%20McGrath">Glenn McGrath</a> took three wickets for 52 runs, while <a href="Brett%20Lee">Brett Lee</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Symonds">Andrew Symonds</a> claimed two wickets each. Ponting was named <a href="man%20of%20the%20match">man of the match</a> for his 140, and Tendulkar, the tournament's leading run-scorer (673 runs), was awarded the man of the series. The final was Australia's seventeenth successive ODI win, a record, and they were the first team to win three World Cups. Ganguly's decision to bowl first in the match was criticised by journalists and former cricketers.

The <a href="2003%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2003 Cricket World Cup</a> was the eighth <a href="Cricket%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a>, organised by the <a href="International%20Cricket%20Council">International Cricket Council</a> (ICC). The competition took place between 9 February and 23 March 2003, lasting 43 days. Co-hosted by South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya, the tournament was the first World Cup to be played in Africa. There were 14 participating teams, the largest number in a World Cup until then. As well as the 10 Test-playing nations, four associate teams took part. <a href="Kenya%20national%20cricket%20team">Kenya</a>, by virtue of its ODI status, automatically qualified for the tournament; <a href="Canada%20national%20cricket%20team">Canada</a>, <a href="Namibia%20national%20cricket%20team">Namibia</a> and <a href="Netherlands%20national%20cricket%20team">Netherlands</a>—the top three teams of the <a href="2001%20ICC%20Trophy">2001 ICC Trophy</a>—formed the rest.

The structure of the tournament was similar to that of the <a href="1999%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">1999 World Cup</a>. The 14 countries were separated into two groups of seven; each team played the others in its group once. The most successful three from each group qualified for the Super Sixes stage, a format which was introduced in the 1999 tournament. Each qualifier carried forward their points from the first stage and played one game against each of the three teams from the other group. The top four teams from the Super Sixes qualified for the semi-finals, and the winners of those matches contested the final. A total of 54 matches were played in the tournament.

The matches were played according to the standard rules of a <a href="One%20Day%20International">One Day International</a> (ODI). Each side batted for a maximum of 50 overs, and fielding restrictions applied for the bowling side. For the first 15 overs only two fielders were allowed outside the <a href="Fielding%20restrictions%20%28cricket%29%23Men%27s%20Fielding%20Restriction%20Circles">infield</a>, and for the rest of the innings four fielders (including a bowler and the <a href="wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper</a>) had to be deployed in the infield. No player was allowed to bowl more than 10 overs in an innings.

The <a href="Australian%20Cricket%20Board">Australian Cricket Board</a> announced their squad for the World Cup on 31 December 2002, but several changes were made to the team before the tournament was completed. In January 2003, <a href="Shane%20Watson">Shane Watson</a> was ruled out following a <a href="stress%20fracture">stress fracture</a> and was replaced by <a href="Ian%20Harvey">Ian Harvey</a>. A day before the tournament started, Australia's key <a href="Spin%20bowling">spinner</a> <a href="Shane%20Warne">Shane Warne</a> was found guilty of using a prohibited <a href="diuretic">diuretic</a> drug during an ODI series held in Australia before the World Cup. He was sent home after he tested positive, and banned from playing for one year. Later, Australia's fast bowler <a href="Jason%20Gillespie">Jason Gillespie</a> was ruled out from the tournament following a tendon injury. Warne and Gillespie were replaced by <a href="Nathan%20Hauritz">Nathan Hauritz</a> (on 24 February 2003) and <a href="Nathan%20Bracken">Nathan Bracken</a> (on 5 March 2003), respectively. An ongoing dispute between the <a href="Board%20for%20Control%20of%20Cricket%20in%20India">Board for Control of Cricket in India</a> (BCCI) and the Indian players over product endorsements ensured a delay in the announcement of a provisional squad for the World Cup. The BCCI announced the final selection of 15 members on 31 December 2002. <a href="Sachin%20Tendulkar">Sachin Tendulkar</a> made into the final squad despite three ongoing injuries, including a major one on the ankle.

Having won 15 out of their 18 ODIs leading up the start of the tournament, the defending champions Australia were deemed one of the favourites to reach the semi-finals. They had previously won the <a href="1987%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">1987</a> and 1999 tournaments. In contrast, some commentators considered it doubtful whether India would qualify for the Super Sixes stage. They had won the competition once, <a href="1983%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">in 1983</a>, but had recently lost an ODI series against <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a> at home, and were defeated heavily in their tour of <a href="Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20New%20Zealand%20in%202002%E2%80%9303">New Zealand</a>.

Australia and India were both in Pool A of the competition. Australia won all their matches in the group stage. Except for their win against England, when they recovered from 135 for 8 to reach the target of 205 <a href="Run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a>, they won all their matches comfortably.

India had a shaky start to the tournament. In their opening match against the <a href="Netherlands%20cricket%20team">Netherlands</a>, they were bowled out for 204 runs. Although they won the game by 79 runs, the team was criticised for failing to bat out their 50 overs. After they were dismissed for 125 runs against Australia and lost the match by nine wickets, angry fans in India burned effigies of the players; <a href="Mohammad%20Kaif">Mohammad Kaif</a>'s house and <a href="Rahul%20Dravid">Rahul Dravid</a>'s car were vandalised. India won all the remaining games of the stage—against Zimbabwe, Pakistan, Namibia and England.

Australia, India and Zimbabwe finished the group as the top three teams and qualified for the Super Sixes from Pool A, while Pool B had Sri Lanka, Kenya and New Zealand progress for the next stage.

In the first match of the Super Sixes against Sri Lanka, Australia made 319 runs for five wickets. The Australian captain <a href="Ricky%20Ponting">Ricky Ponting</a> and his deputy, <a href="Adam%20Gilchrist">Adam Gilchrist</a>, scored 114 not out and 99 respectively. Sri Lanka in reply managed 223 runs in 47.4 overs. <a href="Aravinda%20de%20Silva">Aravinda de Silva</a> top-scored with 92 while <a href="Brett%20Lee">Brett Lee</a> captured three wickets for Australia. In the next match against New Zealand, <a href="Shane%20Bond">Shane Bond</a>'s six wickets for 23 runs reduced Australia to 84 runs for seven wickets in 27 overs before <a href="Michael%20Bevan">Michael Bevan</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Bichel">Andrew Bichel</a> took the total to 208 runs. Lee's five wickets for 42 runs helped to bowl New Zealand out for 112 runs, their lowest total in World Cup. Australia won their final game by five wickets after bowling out Kenya for 174 runs.

After losing the toss against Kenya in their first match, India were set a target of 226 runs. Despite an initial collapse, their captain <a href="Sourav%20Ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a> (107 not out) and <a href="Yuvraj%20Singh">Yuvraj Singh</a> (58 not out) ensured India's victory. In the next game against Sri Lanka, India made 292 runs; Tendulkar (97) and Sehwag (66) top-scored for the team. Srinath took four wickets as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 109, and India won the match by a margin of 183 runs. In their final match of the stage, India played New Zealand. <a href="Zaheer%20Khan">Zaheer Khan</a> returned career-best <a href="Bowling%20analysis">figures</a> of four wickets for 42 runs, and New Zealand were dismissed for 146 runs. India lost three wickets for 21 runs, before Dravid, their vice-captain, and Kaif added 129 runs for the fourth wicket and ensured a seven-wicket win. The match marked the seventh consecutive victory for India in the tournament.

The first semi-final was played between Australia and Sri Lanka on 18 March at <a href="St%20George%27s%20Park%2C%20Port%20Elizabeth">St. George's Park</a>, <a href="Port%20Elizabeth">Port Elizabeth</a>. Australia won the toss and opted to bat first. They managed 212 runs for the loss of 7 wickets at the end of 50 overs. Symonds top-scored for the team with 91 <a href="Not%20out%20%28cricket%29">not out</a>, while <a href="Chaminda%20Vaas">Chaminda Vaas</a> picked up three wickets for Sri Lanka. With 213 runs needed for victory, Sri Lanka lost both the openers after which the play was interrupted by rain. The target was revised to 172 runs from 38.1 overs using the <a href="Duckworth%E2%80%93Lewis%20method">Duckworth–Lewis method</a>, a mathematical formulation used to calculate revised targets for teams batting second in case of matches being interrupted by bad weather or rain. <a href="Kumar%20Sangakkara">Kumar Sangakkara</a> and Vaas made 47 runs together for the eighth wicket, the highest partnership of the innings, but the team managed to score only 123 runs in the allotted overs. Australia progressed into the final as Sri Lanka fell 48 runs short of the target.

The second semi-final was played between India and Kenya on 20 March 2003 at <a href="Kingsmead%20Cricket%20Ground">Kingsmead</a>, <a href="Durban">Durban</a>. Kenya became the first non-Test team to play a World Cup semi-final. India won the toss and made 270 runs for four wickets. Ganguly and Tendulkar made 111 not out and 83 respectively. In reply, Kenya were bowled out for 179 in 46.2 overs. Their captain Steve Tikolo top-scored with 56 runs, while Zaheer Khan took three wickets for 14 runs. Ganguly was adjudged the <a href="Man%20of%20the%20match">Man of the match</a>.

Many journalists considered Australia, undefeated throughout the tournament, to be favourites in the final. The Indian industrialist <a href="Vijay%20Mallya">Vijay Mallya</a> organised special flights, including a few <a href="Air%20charter">chartered ones</a>, to transport film actors, politicians and businessmen to <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>; most of these people supported India. Some South African airlines also extended their support to India. The air tickets from Mumbai to Johannesburg were completely sold out immediately after India entered the Super Sixes stage. Although most journalists and analysts favoured Australia, former <a href="List%20of%20Pakistan%20national%20cricket%20captains">Pakistan captain</a> <a href="Imran%20Khan">Imran Khan</a> believed India were favourites. Former Australia cricketer <a href="Greg%20Chappell">Greg Chappell</a> complimented Brett Lee: he said, except for Lee, no Australian bowler was a serious threat to the Indian batsmen, and also remarked that the "duel" between Lee and Tendulkar would be crucial.

On the eve of the match, which would be his 100th ODI as India's captain, Ganguly issued a statement saying that his team were honoured to play the World Cup final. He cited India's victories at the 1983 World Cup and the 1985 World Championship of Cricket as his inspirations. Although acknowledging Australia as the best side in the world, he stated that they were not "unbeatable". Australia's main concern was Tendulkar, the tournament's top-scorer, of whom the Indian fans had high expectations. Ponting hinted about the possibility that his bowlers, Lee and <a href="Glenn%20McGrath">Glenn McGrath</a>, had "special" plans to restrict him. He also said that in crucial matches his team "tries to reach another level".

Before the match, the two teams had faced each other eight times in World Cups; Australia had won six of them. In the 2003 tournament, Australia won all their matches to that point; India's only defeat came in the group stage against Australia. For all the Indian players it was their first World Cup final, whereas six of the Australians had appeared in at least one previous final.

The final was played on 23 March 2003 at the <a href="Wanderers%20Stadium">Wanderers Stadium</a>, Johannesburg. This was the fifth match to be played at the ground in the tournament. The match, watched by a crowd of 31,779, began at 10:00 <a href="South%20African%20Standard%20Time">SAST</a>. <a href="Simon%20Wilde">Simon Wilde</a>, writing for the "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>", said the venue was one of the "most bountiful" grounds for batsmen. However, on that day the <a href="Pitch%20%28cricket%29">pitch</a> was moist and the outfield was damp as a result of the thunderstorms the previous evening. A short shower that morning forced the ground staff to blow dry air over the pitch. The sky was overcast with a chance of further rainfall. For the umpires—<a href="David%20Shepherd%20%28umpire%29">David Shepherd</a> and <a href="Steve%20Bucknor">Steve Bucknor</a>—it was their third World Cup Final. <a href="Rudi%20Koertzen">Rudi Koertzen</a> and <a href="Billy%20Bowden">Billy Bowden</a> were appointed as the <a href="Third%20umpire">third</a> and <a href="Fourth%20umpire">fourth</a> umpires, respectively. Former Sri Lankan cricketer <a href="Ranjan%20Madugalle">Ranjan Madugalle</a> served as the <a href="match%20referee">match referee</a>.

India remained unchanged from the side that played the semi-final, while Australia excluded Ian Harvey and brought back <a href="Damien%20Martyn">Damien Martyn</a> into the side. Ganguly won the toss and elected to field first. Zaheer Khan opened the bowling for India along with <a href="Javagal%20Srinath">Javagal Srinath</a>. The Australian openers scored aggressively from the beginning of the innings as Khan conceded 15 runs in the first over. Gilchrist in particular hit both Khan and Srinath for many runs and reached his 50 from 40 balls. When Ganguly turned to his spin bowlers as early as the tenth over, Gilchrist slowed his scoring rate. In the fourteenth over, when <a href="Harbhajan%20Singh">Harbhajan Singh</a> was brought back to bowl, Gilchrist (57 off 48 balls) tried to hit him over the <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23midwicket">mid-wicket</a>, but was beaten by the ball's extra bounce and caught in the deep by <a href="Virender%20Sehwag">Virender Sehwag</a>. The pair had added 105 runs for the first wicket. Harbhajan struck again in the twentieth over when he dismissed Hayden (37 runs off 54 balls), leaving the score at 125 runs.

After Hayden's departure, Ponting was joined by Martyn, who completed his half-century in 46 balls. Ponting scored at a slower rate, reaching his 50 off 74 balls with one four. After completing his half century, he accelerated; he hit two <a href="Six%20%28cricket%29">sixes</a> off Harbhajan and one off <a href="Ashish%20Nehra">Ashish Nehra</a>. The pair added 100 runs off 109 balls for the third wicket. Ponting reached his century quickly—his second fifty came off 29 balls. At the end of the innings, Australia had scored 359 runs for two wickets; Ponting had scored 140 not out (off 121 balls; four <a href="Four%20%28cricket%29">fours</a> and eight sixes) and Martyn hit 88 not out (off 84 balls; seven fours and one six) respectively. As of the <a href="2015%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2015 competition</a>, Ponting's innings remains the highest individual score by a captain in a World Cup final, and Australia's total remains the highest by a team in a World Cup final. The 234-run stand between Ponting and Marytn was a record partnership for Australia in ODIs at that point in time. The Indian bowlers conceded 37 <a href="Extra%20%28cricket%29">extras</a>. Srinath conceded 87 runs without taking a wicket—the most expensive figures in his career—in what was his last international game.

India came out to bat with Tendulkar and Sehwag. McGrath opened the bowling for Australia. Tendulkar hit a boundary off the fourth ball of the over but was dismissed off the next delivery. Ganguly joined Sehwag and the pair scored at a run-a-ball before the former was dismissed by Lee in the tenth over. Kaif, the next man, was dismissed in the same over with the score 59 runs for 3 wickets. Dravid and Sehwag scored steadily from then on until the seventeenth over, when rain interrupted play with the score at 103 runs. After play resumed, Ponting brought in Australia's spinners, <a href="Brad%20Hogg">Brad Hogg</a> and <a href="Darren%20Lehmann">Darren Lehmann</a>. Sehwag was more aggressive against both, hitting Lehmann for three consecutive fours and Hogg for a four and six; Dravid played a secondary role to Sehwag, pushing often for singles. They were dismissed in quick succession after making 82 (off 81 balls) and 47 (off 57 balls) respectively. Following that, India began to lose wickets at regular intervals. Except for Yuvraj Singh (24) and Dinesh Mongia (12), the rest of the players were out for single-digit scores. India were bowled out for 234 runs in 39.2 overs when Zaheer Khan was dismissed by McGrath. Australia won the match by 125 runs, the largest margin of victory by runs in a World Cup final. It was their second successive World Cup trophy and their third overall. Ponting was declared the Man of the match for his 140 not out.


Fall of wickets: 1–105 (Gilchrist, 13.6 ov), 2–125 (Hayden, 19.5 ov)


Fall of wickets: 1–4 (Tendulkar, 0.5 ov), 2–58 (Ganguly, 9.5 ov), 3–59 (Kaif, 10.3 ov), 4–147 (Sehwag, 23.5 ov), 5–187 (Dravid, 31.5 ov), 6–208 (Yuvraj Singh, 34.5 ov), 7–209 (Mongia, 35.2 ov), 8–223 (Harbhajan Singh, 37.1 ov), 9–226 (Srinath, 38.2 ov), 10–234 (Khan, 39.2 ov)

Match officials

Key

Australia became the first team to win three World Cups, and registered a record 17 consecutive ODI wins. They also became the third team to win all the matches in a World Cup tournament. Writing for the "Wisden Cricketers' Almanack", Simon Wilde remarked that Australia would have beaten a Rest of the World XI had they been asked.

At the post-match press conference, Ponting said the Indian players showed no signs of winning the match at any point in time. On Australia's win he said, "It's not that we think we are ahead of the others. It's just the way we play." Nevertheless, he complimented both teams by saying that India and Australia were the two best teams in the tournament, and said that the Indian players deserved to be in the final. Ganguly praised the Australian batsmen and said that they played like "real champions".

Ganguly's decision to bowl first was criticised by the media: "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", for instance, said it "backfired horribly". Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan, while denouncing Ganguly's decision, also criticised his idea of going into the match with an unchanged side. He stated that India should have played their <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a>ner <a href="Anil%20Kumble">Anil Kumble</a> as the ball was "gripping [in] the surface". The journalist and former England cricketer <a href="Mike%20Selvey">Mike Selvey</a> believed that Ganguly may have been influenced by the possibility of the Duckworth–Lewis method affecting the result. Indian journalist <a href="Boria%20Majumdar">Boria Majumdar</a> in his book, "Cricketing Cultures in Conflict" (2004), remarked about the possibility of Australia losing the rain-interrupted final, if the result were to be decided by this method. Ganguly defended his decision saying that the overcast conditions and moisture in the pitch meant it was favourable to the bowlers, but they failed to use it properly. Ponting said that he would have opted to bat first had they won the toss. His teammate Symonds, in an interview later, recalled that India's decision to bowl first gave them an impression that they were not "confident enough to take the fight".

Australia were rewarded with prize money totaling , while India received $800,000. Tendulkar's aggregate of 673 runs in the tournament fetched him the Man of the series accolade. Ponting's innings of 140 not out was placed among the best innings of the tournament by <a href="Rediff">Rediff</a>, and among the top 10 performances in a World Cup final by the ICC. Tendulkar and Hayden were included among the "Highest impact World XI", a World Cup team released by the "Wisden" India owned website Impact Index, in February 2015. Srinath, who was then India's leading wicket-taker in ODIs, retired a few months after the competition. The match also marked the end of India coach <a href="John%20Wright%20%28cricketer%29">John Wright</a>'s contract. On his request the <a href="Board%20of%20Control%20for%20Cricket%20in%20India">Board of Control for Cricket in India</a> retained his position in which he continued to serve until 2005.

2010 Sylvania 300

The 2010 Sylvania 300 was a <a href="stock%20car%20racing">stock car racing</a> competition that took place on September 19, 2010. Held at <a href="New%20Hampshire%20Motor%20Speedway">New Hampshire Motor Speedway</a> in <a href="Loudon%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Loudon</a>, <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, the 300-lap race was the twenty-seventh in the <a href="2010%20NASCAR%20Sprint%20Cup%20Series">2010 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series</a>, as well as the first in the ten-race <a href="Chase%20for%20the%20Sprint%20Cup">Chase for the Sprint Cup</a>, which ended the season. <a href="Clint%20Bowyer">Clint Bowyer</a> of the <a href="Richard%20Childress%20Racing">Richard Childress Racing</a> team won the race; <a href="Denny%20Hamlin">Denny Hamlin</a> finished second and <a href="Jamie%20McMurray">Jamie McMurray</a> came in third.

<a href="Brad%20Keselowski">Brad Keselowski</a> won the <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a>, although he was almost immediately passed by <a href="Tony%20Stewart">Tony Stewart</a> at the start of the race. Many Chase for the Sprint Cup participants, including <a href="Jimmie%20Johnson">Jimmie Johnson</a>, <a href="Kurt%20Busch">Kurt Busch</a>, and Hamlin, were in the top ten for most of the race, although some encountered problems in the closing laps. Stewart was leading the race with two laps remaining but ran out of fuel, giving the lead, and the win, to Bowyer. There were twenty-one lead changes among eight different drivers, as well as eight <a href="Caution%20Flag">cautions</a> during the race.

The race was Bowyer's first win in the 2010 season, and the third of his career. The result advanced Bowyer to second in the <a href="List%20of%20NASCAR%20Sprint%20Cup%20Series%20champions">Drivers' Championship</a>, thirty-five points behind Hamlin and ten ahead of <a href="Kevin%20Harvick">Kevin Harvick</a>, although he fell to twelfth in the standings after receiving a post-race penalty. <a href="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a> maintained its lead in the <a href="List%20of%20NASCAR%20Manufacturers%27%20champions">Manufacturers' Championship</a>, thirty-two points ahead of <a href="Toyota">Toyota</a> and seventy-four ahead of <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a>, with nine races remaining in the season. Attendance was 95,000, while 3.68 million watched it on television.

<a href="New%20Hampshire%20Motor%20Speedway">New Hampshire Motor Speedway</a> is one of ten <a href="Oval%20track%20racing%23Intermediate%20tracks">intermediate tracks</a> that hold <a href="NASCAR">NASCAR</a> races. The standard track at New Hampshire Motor Speedway is a four-turn <a href="Oval%20track%20racing">oval track</a>, long. Its <a href="Banked%20turn">banking</a> in the turns varies from two to seven degrees, while the <a href="Straight%20%28racing%29">front stretch</a>, the finish line, and the back stretch are all banked at one degree.

Before the race, <a href="Denny%20Hamlin">Denny Hamlin</a> led the <a href="List%20of%20NASCAR%20Sprint%20Cup%20Series%20champions">Drivers' Championship</a> with 5,060 points, followed by <a href="Jimmie%20Johnson">Jimmie Johnson</a> with 5,050. <a href="Kevin%20Harvick">Kevin Harvick</a> and <a href="Kyle%20Busch">Kyle Busch</a> were tied for third place with 5,030 points, and Kyle's older brother <a href="Kurt%20Busch">Kurt Busch</a> had 5,020 points. <a href="Tony%20Stewart">Tony Stewart</a>, with 5,010 points, was tied with <a href="Greg%20Biffle">Greg Biffle</a>, and <a href="Jeff%20Gordon">Jeff Gordon</a>, <a href="Carl%20Edwards">Carl Edwards</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Burton">Jeff Burton</a>, <a href="Matt%20Kenseth">Matt Kenseth</a> and <a href="Clint%20Bowyer">Clint Bowyer</a> rounded out the top twelve with 5,000 points each. In the <a href="NASCAR%20Manufacturers%27%20Championship">Manufacturers' Championship</a>, <a href="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a> was leading with 188 points, twenty-nine points ahead of their rival <a href="Toyota">Toyota</a>. <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a>, with 120 points, was fifteen points ahead of <a href="Dodge">Dodge</a> in the battle for third place. <a href="Mark%20Martin">Mark Martin</a> was the race's defending champion.

A number of drivers competing in the <a href="2010%20Chase%20for%20the%20Sprint%20Cup">2010 Chase for the Sprint Cup</a> entered the race optimistic about their chances of winning the championship. Biffle argued that he, Burton, or Stewart were "capable of winning it". Johnson, who already had eighteen previous wins in the Chase, observed that "those 10 races in the Chase is its own world. The people act and react differently under pressure, and for the last four years we have done a great job in that environment." Hamlin commented, "Reliability is the only thing we need to work on. It's taken us out of the last three Chases, not being reliable. You have to have it to be the champion." <a href="Ray%20Evernham">Ray Evernham</a> also opined on Hamlin, "I think Denny knows that he has the talent to win the championship. I think that he's got focus right now and a good, veteran crew chief in Mike Ford. If Toyota gives him the speed, he could be a threat."

Three practice sessions were held before the Sunday race—one on Friday, and two on Saturday. The first session lasted 90 minutes, and the second 50 minutes. The final session lasted 60 minutes. During the first practice session, Stewart was fastest, placing ahead of Edwards in second and <a href="Marcos%20Ambrose">Marcos Ambrose</a> in third. <a href="A.%20J.%20Allmendinger">A. J. Allmendinger</a> was scored fourth, and Kyle Busch placed fifth. <a href="David%20Ragan">David Ragan</a>, Johnson, <a href="Brad%20Keselowski">Brad Keselowski</a>, Biffle, and Hamlin rounded out the top ten fastest drivers in the session.

Forty-five drivers attempted to qualify; due to NASCAR's <a href="NASCAR%20rules%20and%20regulations%23Qualifying%20procedure">qualifying procedure</a>, only forty-three could race. Keselowski clinched his first <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a> in the <a href="Sprint%20Cup%20Series">Sprint Cup Series</a>, with a time of 28.515. He was joined on the front row of the <a href="Graining%20%28motorsport%29">grid</a> by Bowyer. Stewart qualified third, <a href="Jamie%20McMurray">Jamie McMurray</a> took fourth, and <a href="Juan%20Pablo%20Montoya">Juan Pablo Montoya</a> started fifth. Johnson, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified twenty-fifth, while Harvick was scored in twenty-seventh. The two drivers who failed to qualify for the race were <a href="Jeff%20Green%20%28racing%20driver%29">Jeff Green</a> and <a href="Johnny%20Sauter">Johnny Sauter</a>. Once qualifying concluded Keselowski said, "I felt I got a shot at the pole before I qualified but you never really know. When I ran the lap I knew I gave up a little bit of time right in the middle of both corners but I had a plan going into it and stuck to it and it worked. I’m really proud of that lap."

On Saturday morning, Stewart was fastest in the second practice session, ahead of <a href="Sam%20Hornish%2C%20Jr.">Sam Hornish, Jr.</a> in second, and McMurray in third. <a href="Ryan%20Newman%20%28racing%20driver%29">Ryan Newman</a> was fourth quickest, and Bowyer took fifth. Kurt Busch, who ended up receiving a penalty for using extra tires, managed sixth. <a href="Mark%20Martin">Mark Martin</a>, Johnson, <a href="Kasey%20Kahne">Kasey Kahne</a>, and Montoya followed in the top ten. Of the other drivers in the Chase, Hamlin was scored sixteenth fastest, while Harvick was scored in twenty-fourth. McMurray paced the final practice session, with Jeff Gordon and Johnson following in second and third respectively. Stewart was fourth fastest, ahead of Montoya and Bowyer. Hamlin was scored seventh, Kahne eighth, <a href="Dale%20Earnhardt%2C%20Jr.">Dale Earnhardt, Jr.</a> ninth, and <a href="David%20Reutimann">David Reutimann</a> tenth. Other Chase drivers included Kyle Busch in twenty-first and Kenseth in thirtieth.

The race, the twenty-seventh of a total of thirty-six in the <a href="2010%20NASCAR%20Sprint%20Cup%20Series">2010 season</a>, began at 1:00 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Daylight%20Time">EDT</a> and was televised live in the United States on <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>. Around the start of the race, weather conditions were partly cloudy with an air temperature around . <a href="Jonathan%20DeFelice">Jonathan DeFelice</a>, president of <a href="St.%20Anselm%20College">St. Anselm College</a> in <a href="Goffstown%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Goffstown</a>, <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, began pre-race ceremonies with the <a href="invocation">invocation</a>. Anthony Gargiula performed the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Anthem">national anthem</a>, and Mark Corcoran, VP of Industrial and Commercial Sales for <a href="Osram%20Sylvania">Sylvania</a>, gave the command for drivers to start their engines. During the <a href="parade%20lap">pace laps</a>, two drivers had to move to the rear of the grid due to unapproved changes: <a href="David%20Gilliland">David Gilliland</a> because of an engine change, and <a href="Andy%20Lally">Andy Lally</a> because of a transmission change.

Keselowski retained his pole position lead into the first corner, with Bowyer behind him. One lap later, Stewart passed Keselowski to become the new race leader; Montoya passed Keselowski for the second position on the next lap. By lap eight, Stewart had a lead of over one second. After starting the race in twelfth, Kurt Busch moved up to ninth position by lap nine. <a href="Paul%20Menard">Paul Menard</a>, who started in eighth, fell to eleventh position by lap twelve. After losing two positions early, Bowyer moved back up into third position by passing Keselowski. By the nineteenth lap, Johnson had moved up eight positions to seventeenth, and Harvick had moved up seven positions to twentieth.

Earnhardt, who began the race in thirty-second, had moved up ten positions to twenty-second by lap 22. Two laps later, Bowyer passed Montoya for second position. <a href="Scott%20Speed">Scott Speed</a> spun sideways and collided with <a href="SAFER%20barrier">the wall</a> four laps later, causing the first caution of the race. On lap 28, <a href="Robby%20Gordon">Robby Gordon</a> moved into the lead for one lap, delaying his <a href="pit%20stop">pit stop</a> until lap 29. Once the race resumed, Bowyer regained the lead followed by McMurray in second. McMurray led the next lap, but Bowyer reclaimed the lead on lap 32. Three laps later, Kyle Busch, in seventh place, collided with the wall, but escaped with minor damage. A collision involving Ambrose and Menard occurred on lap 39 and prompted the second caution.

Most drivers stayed on the track during the caution, allowing Bowyer to remain the leader on the restart. On lap 48, <a href="Michael%20McDowell%20%28racing%20driver%29">Michael McDowell</a> drove to the garage because of engine problems. Five laps later, Bowyer led the race, with McMurray 1.3 seconds behind him. <a href="Landon%20Cassill">Landon Cassill</a> went to the garage due to failing brakes on lap 56. Johnson moved into sixth, as Edwards passed McMurray five laps later for second. By lap 64, Bowyer's lead was over 3.5 seconds.

Four laps later, Johnson passed Keselowski to claim fifth position. On the 81st lap, Earnhardt, Jr. moved into seventh after passing <a href="David%20Reutimann">David Reutimann</a> and Stewart. Two laps later, Kurt Busch and Jeff Burton passed Reutimann for ninth and tenth respectively. During lap 90, Earnhardt passed Keselowski for sixth, as Johnson claimed fourth from McMurray. After 93 laps, Bowyer's lead was over five seconds. Two laps later, green flag pit stops began, as Montoya was the first to pit. On lap 98, Edwards became the new leader after Bowyer came into the pits. One lap later, Kurt Busch became the new leader, followed by Jeff Gordon and Robby Gordon. On lap 102, Bowyer reclaimed the lead as the previous leaders made their stops. <a href="Bobby%20Labonte">Bobby Labonte</a> and <a href="Casey%20Mears">Casey Mears</a> were unable to continue the race after their pit stops.

On lap 113, Burton moved up to sixth, while Jeff Gordon passed Earnhardt for eleventh. Allmendinger fell to twenty-fifth after pit stops due to having run out of fuel on his way onto pit road. Three laps later, both Jeff Gordon and Earnhardt had passed Reutimann for tenth and eleventh respectively. By lap 120, Bowyer had a lead of about four seconds over Edwards. Four laps later, Harvick passed Montoya for fourteenth. On lap 132, Keselowski fell to ninth after being passed by Kurt Busch and Hamlin. On lap 147, Bowyer's lead of over seven seconds was reduced to nothing when the <a href="safety%20car">pace car</a> moved on track. During the caution, which was caused by debris, most of the leaders made pit stops.

Bowyer maintained his lead on the restart. On lap 153, Kyle Busch moved into tenth position by passing Jeff Gordon. Seven laps later, Burton claimed fourth. On the 162nd lap, Ryan Newman moved up to eleventh, as Keselowski fell to twelfth. Two laps later, Jeff Gordon passed Kyle Busch to move into ninth, while Stewart passed Burton for fourth.

On lap 206, Martin's car suffered a flat tire and the fourth caution was given as a result. Bowyer led on the restart, although he was passed by Stewart within one lap. On lap 213, Hamlin spun sideways, prompting the fifth caution. Despite remaining undamaged, Hamlin fell from fourth to twenty-second position. Stewart led on the restart, as Jeff Gordon claimed second from Bowyer. By lap 221, a sixth caution came out as Kurt Busch, Johnson, and Kyle Busch all spun sideways. After the accident, Johnson fell to twenty-fourth; Stewart maintained his lead on the restart. Five laps later, Matt Kenseth spun out, causing the seventh caution. Stewart led the drivers back to the green flag, but was overtaken by McMurray one lap later.

On lap 241, the pace car came out for the eighth and final caution, after <a href="Joey%20Logano">Joey Logano</a> collided with the outside wall. McMurray led on the restart, but Stewart reclaimed the lead on lap 247. Seven laps later, Johnson was forced to pit due to a loose wheel. By lap 257, Stewart had a lead of over one second. Five laps later, Hamlin claimed sixth from Harvick. During the 263rd lap, Bowyer passed McMurray for second. Four laps later, Newman passed Kyle Busch for tenth position. After 269 laps, Stewart's lead over Bowyer was 1.6 seconds. Six laps later, Hamlin moved into fifth position after passing Earnhardt. During lap 290, Hamlin passed McMurray for third. With two laps remaining, Stewart and Burton both ran out of fuel, handing the lead back to Bowyer. Bowyer maintained the lead to win his first race of the 2010 season. Hamlin finished second, ahead of McMurray in third, Earnhardt in fourth, and Harvick in fifth.

Bowyer appeared in <a href="Glossary%20of%20motorsport%20terms%23V">Victory Lane</a> to celebrate his first win of the season in front of 95,000 people who attended the race. Bowyer also earned $248,250 in race winnings. Stewart took his last-minute loss of the race with good humor, saying, "We went down swinging. I think I ran me out of fuel." In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, "First thing I asked is how many cars on the lead lap, because I wanted to see how bad our day was going to be. I set a goal (of) top 15, and then it was top eight and then top six and, 'Holy cow, we can win this thing.' We just made a heck of a charge at the end." Bowyer was delighted with his victory: "[Crew chief] <a href="Shane%20Wilson%20%28racing%29">Shane</a> [Wilson] built a brand new race car and we came here and we were fast right off the truck, and everybody had a lot of confidence, a pep in their step. And we showed it from the time we unloaded to qualifying, practice, we were one of the fastest cars here. That’s what it takes to run at this level, to be a part of that Chase, if we can go and continue to have as much fun as we did this weekend. I know it’s the key, I know it is to my success."

Johnson was candid about his performance: "We had a decent car and ran in the top five and top 10 but just didn't end up finishing there." Harvick was somewhat more upbeat, saying, "We didn't have a great day. We didn't have a great weekend, honestly, and (fifth) says a lot about this team. If we keep doing that on our bad days, we will be in good shape." The race result left Hamlin leading the Drivers' Championship with 5,230 points. Bowyer, who finished first, moved to second on 5,195, ten points ahead of Harvick and twenty-seven ahead of Kyle Busch. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet maintained the lead with 197 points. Toyota remained second with 165 points. Ford followed with 123 points, fourteen points ahead of Dodge in fourth. 3.68 million people watched the race on television. The race took two hours, fifty-eight minutes and twenty-two seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 0.477 seconds.

Although Bowyer's car passed initial inspection, NASCAR announced that they had "discovered issues with the car in a more thorough inspection at its research and development center". Three days after the race, two teams were given penalties: <a href="Richard%20Childress%20Racing">Richard Childress Racing</a> for Bowyer's car, and <a href="Whitney%20Motorsports">Whitney Motorsports</a> for McDowell's car. Richard Childress Racing's penalty, for unauthorized alterations to the rear bodywork of Bowyer's car, included a $150,000 fine and a six race <a href="suspension%20%28vehicle%29">suspension</a> for Wilson, and the loss of 150 owner and driver points for <a href="Richard%20Childress">Richard Childress</a> and Bowyer respectively. RCR's car chief, Chad Haney, was placed on probation until December 31, 2010, and suspended from NASCAR until November 3, 2010. Whitney Motorsports' penalty was for engine exhaust valves that did not meet NASCAR's weight requirements. The penalties for that included a $50,000 fine and six race suspension for Jeremy Lafaver, while both McDowell and owner Dusty Whitney lost 50 driver and owner points respectively.

Childress and Bowyer were both upset with the penalties and almost immediately announced plans to appeal. Bowyer argued the penalties to be too severe, saying, "I don't think the penalty fits the crime. Sixty-thousandths of an inch, folks. Grab a quarter out of your pocket. Less than the thickness of that quarter right there is worth a 150-point fine?" He also argued that his car could have been damaged slightly after the race as his car was pushed by a wrecker after it ran out of gas on its way to victory lane. "Is it possible that a two-ton wrecker could bend the quarter-panel 60-thousandths of an inch? You have to ask yourself that." The team lost the initial appeal, forcing them to make a final appeal to <a href="NASCAR%20National%20Commissioner">NASCAR National Commissioner</a> John Middlebrook. As a result of the final appeal, Wilson's fine was reduced to $100,000 while he and Haney's suspensions were reduced from six to four races (they were allowed to work with the team during the appeal process); however, the points penalty administered to Bowyer and his team was upheld.

Asked if he thought Bowyer could still win the championship after this setback, Stewart argued, "It's possible for sure. The biggest thing is going to be going to the race track and having that stress of not having his crew chief, not having his car chief and those are two key people on a race weekend ... I can promise you that Childress has the resources to cover this ... it's definitely possible, but everyone else is going to have to have trouble." Bowyer did not lose the victory title for the race itself; NASCAR vice president of competition <a href="Robin%20Pemberton">Robin Pemberton</a> commented, "We don't consider taking away the win. If you ask some, they would consider a 150-point penalty with only nine races to go in the Chase a pretty hefty penalty."

Pipistrellus raceyi

Pipistrellus raceyi, also known as Racey's pipistrelle, is a <a href="bat">bat</a> from <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, in the genus "<a href="Pipistrellus">Pipistrellus</a>". Although unidentified species of "Pipistrellus" had been previously reported from Madagascar since the 1990s, "P. raceyi" was not formally named until 2006. It is apparently most closely related to the Asian species "<a href="Pipistrellus%20endoi">P. endoi</a>", "<a href="Pipistrellus%20paterculus">P. paterculus</a>", and "<a href="Pipistrellus%20abramus">P. abramus</a>", and its ancestors probably reached Madagascar from Asia. "P. raceyi" has been recorded at four sites, two in the eastern and two in the western lowlands. In the east, it is found in open areas and has been found roosting in a building; in the west it occurs in dry forest. Because of uncertainties about its ecology, it is listed as "<a href="Data%20Deficient">Data Deficient</a>" on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>.

With a forearm length of 28.0 to 31.2 mm (1.10 to 1.23 in), "Pipistrellus raceyi" is small to medium-sized for a species of "Pipistrellus". The body is reddish above and yellow-brown below. The wings are dark and the feet are small. Males have a long penis and <a href="baculum">baculum</a> (penis bone), which is somewhat similar to those of "P. endoi", "P. abramus" and "P. paterculus". In the skull, the <a href="Rostrum%20%28anatomy%29">rostrum</a> (front part) is less flat than in related species and the <a href="supraorbital%20ridge">supraorbital ridge</a>s (above the eyes) are prominent. The fourth upper <a href="premolar">premolar</a> does not touch the upper <a href="canine%20%28tooth%29">canine</a> and the second lower premolar is well-developed.

Since they were first recorded in 1905, when Thomas and Schwann described the species "Vespertilio matroka" (currently "<a href="Neoromicia%20matroka">Neoromicia matroka</a>"), the <a href="classification%20%28biology%29">classification</a> and status of small <a href="Vespertilionidae">vespertilionid</a> bats ("pipistrelles") from Madagascar have remained unclear. Although several species were recorded, they remained little known. A species of the genus "<a href="Pipistrellus">Pipistrellus</a>" with affinities to <a href="Indomalaya%20ecozone">Oriental</a> (southeastern Asian) species was first recorded in 1995, and several later authors recorded one or more unidentified "Pipistrellus" species.

In 2006, Paul Bates and colleagues reported on a collection of 44 Malagasy "pipistrelles" received by the <a href="Harrison%20Institute">Harrison Institute</a>, which included several species new to Madagascar, as well as a single species new to science. This species, a member of "Pipistrellus", was described as "Pipistrellus raceyi". In a 2007 article, <a href="Steven%20Goodman">Steven Goodman</a> mentioned it as part of a flurry of new <a href="List%20of%20bats%20of%20Madagascar">bat species from Madagascar</a>; the number of species increased from 27 in 1995 to 37 in 2007. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a>, "raceyi", honors bat researcher <a href="Paul%20Racey">Paul Racey</a> and the describers suggested the <a href="common%20name">common name</a> "Racey's pipistrelle bat". "P. raceyi" closely resembles the Asian species "<a href="Pipistrellus%20endoi">P. endoi</a>", "<a href="Pipistrellus%20paterculus">P. paterculus</a>", and "<a href="Pipistrellus%20abramus">P. abramus</a>", and Bates and colleagues hypothesized that it may be related to these species. If this is true, the ancestors of "P. raceyi" presumably reached Madagascar from Asia, not from Africa like most of the island's bat fauna. "P. raceyi" shares this distinction with a few other Malagasy bats: the large fruit bat "<a href="Pteropus%20rufus">Pteropus rufus</a>" and both species of the small insectivorous bat "<a href="Emballonura">Emballonura</a>" recorded on Madagascar.

"Pipistrellus raceyi" is a small to medium-sized pipistrelle. It is long-furred and the body is reddish above, with the head a trifle darker, and yellowish-brown below. The <a href="gland">gland</a>ular swellings on the muzzle, next to the nose, are hairless. The dark, short, round ears bear three to five ridges. The crescent-shaped <a href="tragus%20%28ear%29">tragus</a> (a projection on the inner side of the outer ear) is about half as long as the ear and contains a slight constriction on the back side of its base. The wings are dark. The third through fifth <a href="metacarpal">metacarpal</a>s (hand bones) are about equally long, but the first <a href="Phalanx%20bone">phalange</a> (finger bone) on the third finger is short. "P. endoi" has a longer first phalange on the third metacarpal. "P. raceyi" has short <a href="tibia">tibia</a>e (lower leg bones) and small feet and the tail is shorter than the head and body. Forearm length is 28.0 to 31.2 mm (1.10 to 1.23 in), tail length is 22.9 to 30.3 mm (0.90 to 1.19 in), hindfoot length is 5.3 to 7.5 mm (0.21 to 0.30 in), and ear length is 7.5 to 10.6 mm (0.30 to 0.42 in) in 13 measured specimens. Females average slightly larger than males.

Males have a long, straight penis with a notch between the shaft and the narrow, egg-shaped <a href="glans%20penis">glans penis</a>. Near the top, the penis is haired, but the base is almost naked. In the <a href="baculum">baculum</a> (penis bone), the shaft is long and narrow and slightly curved. The length of the penis and baculum distinguish "P. raceyi" from all comparably sized African and Malagasy vespertilionids. "P. endoi", "P. paterculus", and "P. abramus" have more similar bacula, but that of "P. abramus" is more curved, the shaft and the tip are more robust in "P. paterculus", and the proximal (near) end is more robust in "P. endoi". In males, penis length is 9.6 to 11.8 mm (0.38 to 0.46 in) and baculum length is 8.8 to 10.0 mm (0.35 to 0.39 in).

In the skull, there is a well-defined lowered area in the middle of the rostrum (front part), which nearly touches the back margin of the large, V-shaped nasal aperture (opening for the nose). Next to the aperture are two elevated areas, above the <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s. The <a href="zygomatic%20arch">zygomatic arch</a>es (cheekbones) are slender. The <a href="supraorbital%20ridge">supraorbital ridge</a>s (located above the eyes) are well-developed. "P. abramus", "P. endoi", and "P. paterculus" have a flatter rostrum and less prominent supraorbital ridges. The <a href="braincase">braincase</a> is of average size and bears a poorly developed <a href="sagittal%20crest">sagittal crest</a> on its roof. The <a href="supraoccipital">supraoccipital</a>, the backmost part of the skull, is convex. The sides of the concave <a href="palate">palate</a> are about parallel.

The <a href="dental%20formula">dental formula</a> is (two <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s, one <a href="canine%20tooth">canine</a>, two <a href="premolar">premolar</a>s, and three <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a> in the upper jaw, and three incisors, one canine, two premolars, and three molars in the lower jaw). Because the ancestors of "P. raceyi" lost the first upper incisor and first and third upper and lower premolars, the upper incisors are designated I2 and I3 and the premolars are designated P2 and P4 (uppers) and p2 and p4 (lowers). I2 has a well-developed second cusp in addition to the main cusp and I3 about reaches the height of the second cusp of I2. The stout upper canine bears a single cusp. P2 is prominent and is displaced slightly towards the inner side of the toothrow. P4 does not contact the canine. The first and second upper molar (M1 and M2) are about equally large, but M3 is smaller. Each of the lower incisors bears three cusps and the third (i3) may touch the lower canine (c1). The latter tooth has a second cusp, which reaches higher than i3. The p2 touches the back of c1 and attains between 59-100% the crown area of p4. The first two lower molars (m1 and m2) have the back group of cusps (<a href="talonid">talonid</a>) larger than the front one (<a href="trigonid">trigonid</a>), and m3 is again smaller.

"Pipistrellus raceyi" is known from four places on Madagascar, all below 80 m (260 ft) altitude, of which two are on the west and two on the east side of the island. Among the eastern collection sites, <a href="Kianjavato">Kianjavato</a> is a rural town surrounded by farmland and secondary forests, where "P. raceyi" were collected while leaving a hollow in the concrete wall of a house and in a <a href="mistnet">mistnet</a> over a river, and <a href="Tampolo">Tampolo</a> is in a heavily disturbed agriculturally used area. Both western localities, <a href="Kirindy">Kirindy</a> and <a href="Mikea">Mikea</a>, are in dry forest. In Kirindy, the pipistrelle "<a href="Hypsugo%20anchietae">Hypsugo anchietae</a>" has also been recorded. The true distribution of "P. raceyi" is probably larger than that currently known. Nothing is known about the diet, but vespertilionid bats generally eat insects.

There is very limited data on reproduction. Young are probably born near the start of the <a href="rainy%20season">rainy season</a>, in November–December, when food is plentiful. Six bats were caught at the roost site in Kianjavato, of which only one was a male; this led Bates and colleagues to suggest that the species may be <a href="polygynous">polygynous</a>, with groups consisting of a male and multiple females.

The <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> has assessed "Pipistrellus raceyi" as "<a href="Data%20Deficient">Data Deficient</a>" because of insufficient knowledge about its abundance and habitat requirements. All four known sites are near forest, but that may be a <a href="sampling%20%28statistics%29">sampling</a> artifact. Although <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a> may pose a threat, each of the collection sites has some sort of forest protection measures in place.

Mary Shelley

Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (née Godwin; 30 August 1797 – 1 February 1851) was an English novelist, short story writer, dramatist, essayist, biographer, and <a href="travel%20literature">travel writer</a>, best known for her <a href="Gothic%20fiction">Gothic novel</a> <a href="Frankenstein">"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus"</a> (1818). She also edited and promoted the works of her husband, the <a href="Romantic%20poetry">Romantic poet</a> and philosopher <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>. Her father was the <a href="political%20philosopher">political philosopher</a> <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a>, and her mother was the philosopher and feminist <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>.

After Wollstonecraft's death less than a month after her daughter Mary was born, Mary was raised by Godwin, who was able to provide his daughter with a rich, if informal, education, encouraging her to adhere to his own <a href="Anarchism">anarchist</a> political theories. When Mary was four, her father married a neighbour, with whom, as her stepmother, Mary came to have a troubled relationship.

In 1814, Mary began a romance with one of her father's political followers, <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>, who was already married. Together with Mary's stepsister <a href="Claire%20Clairmont">Claire Clairmont</a>, Mary and Shelley left for France and travelled through Europe. Upon their return to England, Mary was pregnant with Percy's child. Over the next two years, she and Percy faced ostracism, constant debt, and the death of their prematurely born daughter. They married in late 1816, after the suicide of Percy Shelley's first wife, Harriet.

In 1816, the couple famously spent a summer with <a href="George%20Gordon%20Byron%2C%206th%20Baron%20Byron">Lord Byron</a>, <a href="John%20William%20Polidori">John William Polidori</a>, and Claire Clairmont near <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>, Switzerland, where Mary conceived the idea for her novel "Frankenstein". The Shelleys left Britain in 1818 for Italy, where their second and third children died before Mary Shelley gave birth to her last and only surviving child, <a href="Percy%20Florence%20Shelley">Percy Florence Shelley</a>. In 1822, her husband drowned when his sailing boat sank during a storm near <a href="Viareggio">Viareggio</a>. A year later, Mary Shelley returned to England and from then on devoted herself to the upbringing of her son and a career as a professional author. The last decade of her life was dogged by illness, most likely caused by the brain tumour which killed her at age 53.

Until the 1970s, Mary Shelley was known mainly for her efforts to publish her husband's works and for her novel "Frankenstein", which remains widely read and has inspired many theatrical and film adaptations. Recent scholarship has yielded a more comprehensive view of Mary Shelley’s achievements. Scholars have shown increasing interest in her literary output, particularly in her novels, which include the historical novels "<a href="Valperga%20%28novel%29">Valperga</a>" (1823) and "<a href="The%20Fortunes%20of%20Perkin%20Warbeck">Perkin Warbeck</a>" (1830), the <a href="apocalyptic%20and%20post-apocalyptic%20fiction">apocalyptic</a> novel "<a href="The%20Last%20Man">The Last Man</a>" (1826), and her final two novels, "<a href="Lodore">Lodore</a>" (1835) and "<a href="Falkner%20%28novel%29">Falkner</a>" (1837). Studies of her lesser-known works, such as the travel book "<a href="Rambles%20in%20Germany%20and%20Italy">Rambles in Germany and Italy</a>" (1844) and the biographical articles for <a href="Dionysius%20Lardner">Dionysius Lardner's</a> "<a href="Lardner%27s%20Cabinet%20Cyclopaedia">Cabinet Cyclopaedia</a>" (1829–1846), support the growing view that Mary Shelley remained a political <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29">radical</a> throughout her life. Mary Shelley's works often argue that cooperation and sympathy, particularly as practised by women in the family, were the ways to reform civil society. This view was a direct challenge to the individualistic <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> ethos promoted by Percy Shelley and the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> political theories articulated by her father, William Godwin.

Mary Shelley was born Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin in <a href="Somers%20Town%2C%20London">Somers Town, London</a>, in 1797. She was the second child of the feminist philosopher, educator, and writer <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>, and the first child of the philosopher, novelist, and journalist <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a>. Wollstonecraft died of <a href="Postpartum%20infections">puerperal fever</a> shortly after Mary was born. Godwin was left to bring up Mary, along with her older half-sister, <a href="Fanny%20Imlay">Fanny Imlay</a>, Wollstonecraft's child by the American speculator <a href="Gilbert%20Imlay">Gilbert Imlay</a>. A year after Wollstonecraft's death, Godwin published his "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20the%20Author%20of%20A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1798), which he intended as a sincere and compassionate tribute. However, because the "Memoirs" revealed Wollstonecraft's affairs and her illegitimate child, they were seen as shocking. Mary Godwin read these memoirs and her mother's books, and was brought up to cherish her mother's memory.

Mary's earliest years were happy, judging from the letters of William Godwin's housekeeper and nurse, Louisa Jones. But Godwin was often deeply in debt; feeling that he could not raise the children by himself, he cast about for a second wife. In December 1801, he married Mary Jane Clairmont, a well-educated woman with two young children of her own—Charles and <a href="Claire%20Clairmont">Claire</a>. Most of Godwin’s friends disliked his new wife, describing her as quick-tempered and quarrelsome; but Godwin was devoted to her, and the marriage was a success. Mary Godwin, on the other hand, came to detest her stepmother. William Godwin's 19th-century biographer <a href="Charles%20Kegan%20Paul">Charles Kegan Paul</a> later suggested that Mrs Godwin had favoured her own children over those of Mary Wollstonecraft.

Together, the Godwins started a publishing firm called M. J. Godwin, which sold children's books as well as stationery, maps, and games. However, the business did not turn a profit, and Godwin was forced to borrow substantial sums to keep it going. He continued to borrow to pay off earlier loans, compounding his problems. By 1809, Godwin's business was close to failure, and he was "near to despair". Godwin was saved from <a href="debtor%27s%20prison">debtor's prison</a> by philosophical devotees such as <a href="Francis%20Place">Francis Place</a>, who lent him further money.

Though Mary Godwin received little formal education, her father tutored her in a broad range of subjects. He often took the children on educational outings, and they had access to his library and to the many intellectuals who visited him, including the <a href="Romantic%20poetry">Romantic poet</a> <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a> and the former vice-president of the United States <a href="Aaron%20Burr">Aaron Burr</a>. Godwin admitted he was not educating the children according to Mary Wollstonecraft's philosophy as outlined in works such as "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1792), but Mary Godwin nonetheless received an unusual and advanced education for a girl of the time. She had a <a href="governess">governess</a>, a daily tutor, and read many of her father's children's books on Roman and Greek history in manuscript. For six months in 1811, she also attended a boarding school in <a href="Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a>. Her father described her at age 15 as "singularly bold, somewhat imperious, and active of mind. Her desire of knowledge is great, and her perseverance in everything she undertakes almost invincible."

In June 1812, Mary's father sent her to stay with the <a href="dissenter">dissenting</a> family of the <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29">radical</a> William Baxter, near <a href="Dundee">Dundee</a>, Scotland. To Baxter, he wrote, "I am anxious that she should be brought up ... like a philosopher, even like a cynic." Scholars have speculated that she may have been sent away for her health, to remove her from the seamy side of business, or to introduce her to radical politics. Mary Godwin revelled in the spacious surroundings of Baxter's house and in the companionship of his four daughters, and she returned north in the summer of 1813 for a further stay of 10 months. In the 1831 introduction to "Frankenstein", she recalled: "I wrote then—but in a most common-place style. It was beneath the trees of the grounds belonging to our house, or on the bleak sides of the woodless mountains near, that my true compositions, the airy flights of my imagination, were born and fostered."

Mary Godwin may have first met the radical poet-philosopher <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a> in the interval between her two stays in Scotland. By the time she returned home for a second time on 30 March 1814, Percy Shelley had become estranged from his wife and was regularly visiting Godwin, whom he had agreed to bail out of debt. Percy Shelley's <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29">radicalism</a>, particularly his economic views, which he had imbibed from William Godwin's "<a href="Political%20Justice">Political Justice</a>" (1793), had alienated him from his wealthy <a href="Aristocracy%20%28class%29">aristocratic</a> family: they wanted him to follow traditional models of the landed aristocracy, and he wanted to donate large amounts of the family's money to schemes intended to help the disadvantaged. Percy Shelley therefore had difficulty gaining access to money until he inherited his estate, because his family did not want him wasting it on projects of "political justice". After several months of promises, Shelley announced that he either could not or would not pay off all of Godwin's debts. Godwin was angry and felt betrayed.

Mary and Percy began meeting each other secretly at <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>'s grave in <a href="St%20Pancras%20Old%20Church">St Pancras Churchyard</a>, and they fell in love—she was nearly 17, he nearly 22. On 26 June 1814, Shelley and Godwin declared their love for one another as Shelley announced he could not hide his "ardent passion", leading her in a "sublime and rapturous moment" to say she felt the same way; on either that day or the next, Godwin lost her virginity to Shelley, which tradition claims happened in the cemetery. Godwin described herself as attracted to Shelley's "wild, intellectual, unearthly looks". To Mary's dismay, her father disapproved, and tried to thwart the relationship and salvage the "spotless fame" of his daughter. At about the same time, Mary's father learned of Shelley's inability to pay off the father's debts. Mary, who later wrote of "my excessive and romantic attachment to my father", was confused. She saw Percy Shelley as an embodiment of her parents' liberal and reformist ideas of the 1790s, particularly Godwin's view that marriage was a repressive monopoly, which he had argued in his 1793 edition of "Political Justice" but since retracted. On 28 July 1814, the couple eloped and secretly left for France, taking Mary's stepsister, <a href="Claire%20Clairmont">Claire Clairmont</a>, with them, but leaving Percy's pregnant wife behind.

After convincing Mary Jane Godwin, who had pursued them to <a href="Calais">Calais</a>, that they did not wish to return, the trio travelled to Paris, and then, by donkey, mule, carriage, and foot, through a France recently ravaged by war, to Switzerland. "It was acting in a novel, being an incarnate romance," Mary Shelley recalled in 1826. Godwin wrote about France in 1814: "The distress of the inhabitants, whose houses had been burned, their cattle killed and all their wealth destroyed, has given a sting to my detestation of war...". As they travelled, Mary and Percy read works by Mary Wollstonecraft and others, kept a joint journal, and continued their own writing. At <a href="Lucerne">Lucerne</a>, lack of money forced the three to turn back. They travelled down the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> and by land to the Dutch port of <a href="Maassluis">Marsluys</a>, arriving at <a href="Gravesend%2C%20Kent">Gravesend, Kent</a>, on 13 September 1814.

The situation awaiting Mary Godwin in England was fraught with complications, some of which she had not foreseen. Either before or during the journey, she had become pregnant. She and Percy now found themselves penniless, and, to Mary's genuine surprise, her father refused to have anything to do with her. The couple moved with Claire into lodgings at Somers Town, and later, Nelson Square. They maintained their intense programme of reading and writing, and entertained Percy Shelley's friends, such as <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson%20Hogg">Thomas Jefferson Hogg</a> and the writer <a href="Thomas%20Love%20Peacock">Thomas Love Peacock</a>. Percy Shelley sometimes left home for short periods to dodge creditors. The couple's distraught letters reveal their pain at these separations.

Pregnant and often ill, Mary Godwin had to cope with Percy's joy at the birth of his son by Harriet Shelley in late 1814 and his constant outings with Claire Clairmont. Shelley and Clairmont were almost certainly lovers, which caused much jealousy on Godwin's part. Shelley greatly offended Godwin at one point when during a walk in the French countryside he suggested that they both take the plunge into a stream naked as it offended her principles. She was partly consoled by the visits of Hogg, whom she disliked at first but soon considered a close friend. Percy Shelley seems to have wanted Mary Godwin and Hogg to become lovers; Mary did not dismiss the idea, since in principle she believed in <a href="free%20love">free love</a>. In practice, however, she loved only Percy Shelley and seems to have ventured no further than flirting with Hogg. On 22 February 1815, she gave birth to a two-months premature baby girl, who was not expected to survive. On 6 March, she wrote to Hogg:

My dearest Hogg my baby is dead—will you come to see me as soon as you can. I wish to see you—It was perfectly well when I went to bed—I awoke in the night to give it suck it appeared to be "sleeping" so quietly that I would not awake it. It was dead then, but we did not find "that" out till morning—from its appearance it evidently died of convulsions—Will you come—you are so calm a creature & Shelley is afraid of a fever from the milk—for I am no longer a mother now.

The loss of her child induced acute depression in Mary Godwin, who was haunted by visions of the baby; but she conceived again and had recovered by the summer. With a revival in Percy Shelley's finances after the death of his grandfather, Sir Bysshe Shelley, the couple holidayed in <a href="Torquay">Torquay</a> and then rented a <a href="Shelley%27s%20Cottage">two-storey cottage at Bishopsgate</a>, on the edge of <a href="Windsor%20Great%20Park">Windsor Great Park</a>. Little is known about this period in Mary Godwin's life, since her journal from May 1815 to July 1816 is lost. At Bishopsgate, Percy wrote his poem "<a href="Alastor%2C%20or%20The%20Spirit%20of%20Solitude">Alastor, or The Spirit of Solitude</a>"; and on 24 January 1816, Mary gave birth to a second child, William, named after her father, and soon nicknamed "Willmouse". In her novel "<a href="The%20Last%20Man">The Last Man</a>", she later imagined Windsor as a Garden of Eden.

In May 1816, Mary Godwin, Percy Shelley, and their son travelled to <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> with Claire Clairmont. They planned to spend the summer with the poet <a href="George%20Gordon%20Byron%2C%206th%20Baron%20Byron">Lord Byron</a>, whose recent affair with Claire had left her pregnant. The party arrived at Geneva on 14 May 1816, where Mary called herself "Mrs Shelley". Byron joined them on 25 May, with his young physician, <a href="John%20Polidori">John William Polidori</a>, and rented the <a href="Villa%20Diodati">Villa Diodati</a>, close to <a href="Lake%20Geneva">Lake Geneva</a> at the village of <a href="Cologny">Cologny</a>; Percy Shelley rented a smaller building called Maison Chapuis on the waterfront nearby. They spent their time writing, boating on the lake, and talking late into the night.

"It proved a wet, ungenial summer", Mary Shelley remembered in 1831, "and incessant rain often confined us for days to the house". Sitting around a log fire at Byron's villa, the company amused themselves with <a href="Fantasmagoriana">German ghost stories</a>, which prompted Byron to propose that they "each write a ghost story". Unable to think of a story, young Mary Godwin became anxious: ""Have you thought of a story?" I was asked each morning, and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying negative." During one mid-June evening, the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life. "Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated", Mary noted, "<a href="galvanism">galvanism</a> had given token of such things". It was after midnight before they retired, and unable to sleep, she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the "grim terrors" of her "waking dream", her ghost story:

She began writing what she assumed would be a short story. With Percy Shelley's encouragement, she expanded this tale into her first novel, <a href="Frankenstein">"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus"</a>, published in 1818. She later described that summer in Switzerland as the moment "when I first stepped out from childhood into life". The story of the writing of "Frankenstein" has been fictionalised several times and formed the basis for a number of films.

In September 2011, the astronomer Donald Olson, after a visit to the Lake Geneva villa the previous year, and inspecting data about the motion of the moon and stars, concluded that her "waking dream" took place "between 2am and 3am" 16 June 1816, several days after the initial idea by Lord Byron that they each write a ghost story.

Shelley and her husband collaborated on the story but the extent of Percy’s contribution to the novel is unknown and has been argued over by readers and critics. There are differences in the 1818, 1823 and 1831 editions and Mary Shelley wrote, "I certainly did not owe the suggestion of one incident, nor scarcely of one train of feeling, to my husband, and yet but for his incitement, it would never have taken the form in which it was presented to the world." She wrote that the preface to the first edition was Percy's work "as far as I can recollect." James Rieger concluded Percy's "assistance at every point in the book's manufacture was so extensive that one hardly knows whether to regard him as editor or minor collaborator", while Anne K. Mellor later argued Percy only "made many technical corrections and several times clarified the narrative and thematic continuity of the text." Charles E. Robinson, editor of a facsimile edition of the "Frankenstein" manuscripts, concluded that Percy's contributions to the book "were no more than what most publishers' editors have provided new (or old) authors or, in fact, what colleagues have provided to each other after reading each other's works in progress."

On their return to England in September, Mary and Percy moved—with Claire Clairmont, who took lodgings nearby—to <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>, where they hoped to keep Claire’s pregnancy secret. At Cologny, Mary Godwin had received two letters from her half-sister, <a href="Fanny%20Imlay">Fanny Imlay</a>, who alluded to her "unhappy life"; on 9 October, Fanny wrote an "alarming letter" from <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> that sent Percy Shelley racing off to search for her, without success. On the morning of 10 October, Fanny Imlay was found dead in a room at a <a href="Swansea">Swansea</a> inn, along with a suicide note and a <a href="laudanum">laudanum</a> bottle. On 10 December, Percy Shelley's wife, Harriet, was discovered drowned in the <a href="Serpentine%20%28lake%29">Serpentine</a>, a lake in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park, London</a>. Both suicides were hushed up. Harriet’s family obstructed Percy Shelley's efforts—fully supported by Mary Godwin—to assume custody of his two children by Harriet. His lawyers advised him to improve his case by marrying; so he and Mary, who was pregnant again, married on 30 December 1816 at St Mildred's Church, <a href="Bread%20Street">Bread Street</a>, London. Mr and Mrs Godwin were present and the marriage ended the family rift.

Claire Clairmont gave birth to a baby girl on 13 January, at first called Alba, later <a href="Allegra%20Byron">Allegra</a>. In March of that year, the <a href="Court%20of%20Chancery">Chancery Court</a> ruled Percy Shelley morally unfit to assume custody of his children and later placed them with a clergyman's family. Also in March, the Shelleys moved with Claire and Alba to Albion House at <a href="Marlow%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Marlow, Buckinghamshire</a>, a large, damp building on the river <a href="Thames">Thames</a>. There Mary Shelley gave birth to her third child, Clara, on 2 September. At Marlow, they entertained their new friends Marianne and <a href="James%20Henry%20Leigh%20Hunt">Leigh Hunt</a>, worked hard at their writing, and often discussed politics.

Early in the summer of 1817, Mary Shelley finished "Frankenstein", which was published anonymously in January 1818. Reviewers and readers assumed that Percy Shelley was the author, since the book was published with his preface and dedicated to his political hero William Godwin. At Marlow, Mary edited the joint journal of the group's 1814 Continental journey, adding material written in Switzerland in 1816, along with Percy's poem "<a href="Mont%20Blanc%20%28poem%29">Mont Blanc</a>". The result was the "History of a Six Weeks' Tour", published in November 1817. That autumn, Percy Shelley often lived away from home in London to evade creditors. The threat of a <a href="debtor%27s%20prison">debtor's prison</a>, combined with their ill health and fears of losing custody of their children, contributed to the couple's decision to leave England for Italy on 12 March 1818, taking Claire Clairmont and Alba with them. They had no intention of returning.

One of the party's first tasks on arriving in Italy was to hand Alba over to Byron, who was living in <a href="Venice">Venice</a>. He had agreed to raise her so long as Claire had nothing more to do with her. The Shelleys then embarked on a roving existence, never settling in any one place for long. Along the way, they accumulated a circle of friends and acquaintances who often moved with them. The couple devoted their time to writing, reading, learning, sightseeing, and socialising. The Italian adventure was, however, blighted for Mary Shelley by the deaths of both her children—Clara, in September 1818 in Venice, and William, in June 1819 in Rome. These losses left her in a deep depression that isolated her from Percy Shelley, who wrote in his notebook:

<poem>My dearest Mary, wherefore hast thou gone,
And left me in this dreary world alone?
Thy form is here indeed—a lovely one—
But thou art fled, gone down a dreary road
That leads to Sorrow's most obscure abode.
For thine own sake I cannot follow thee
Do thou return for mine.
</poem>

For a time, Mary Shelley found comfort only in her writing. The birth of her fourth child, <a href="Percy%20Florence%20Shelley">Percy Florence</a>, on 12 November 1819, finally lifted her spirits, though she nursed the memory of her lost children till the end of her life.

Italy provided the Shelleys, Byron, and other exiles with a political freedom unattainable at home. Despite its associations with personal loss, Italy became for Mary Shelley "a country which memory painted as paradise". Their Italian years were a time of intense intellectual and creative activity for both Shelleys. While Percy composed a series of major poems, Mary wrote the novel "<a href="Matilda%20%28novella%29">Matilda</a>", the historical novel "<a href="Valperga%20%28novel%29">Valperga</a>", and the plays "<a href="Proserpine%20%28play%29">Proserpine</a>" and "<a href="Midas%20%28Shelley%29">Midas</a>". Mary wrote "Valperga" to help alleviate her father's financial difficulties, as Percy refused to assist him further. She was often physically ill, however, and prone to depressions. She also had to cope with Percy’s interest in other women, such as <a href="Sophia%20Stacey">Sophia Stacey</a>, Emilia Viviani, and <a href="Jane%20Williams">Jane Williams</a>. Since Mary Shelley shared his belief in the non-exclusivity of marriage, she formed emotional ties of her own among the men and women of their circle. She became particularly fond of the Greek revolutionary <a href="Alexandros%20Mavrokordatos">Prince Alexandros Mavrokordatos</a> and of Jane and <a href="Edward%20Ellerker%20Williams">Edward Williams</a>.

In December 1818, the Shelleys travelled south with Claire Clairmont and their servants to <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, where they stayed for three months, receiving only one visitor, a physician. In 1820, they found themselves plagued by accusations and threats from Paolo and Elise Foggi, former servants whom Percy Shelley had dismissed in Naples shortly after the Foggis had married. The pair revealed that on 27 February 1819 in Naples, Percy Shelley had registered as his child by Mary Shelley a two-month-old baby girl named Elena Adelaide Shelley. The Foggis also claimed that Claire Clairmont was the baby's mother. Biographers have offered various interpretations of these events: that Percy Shelley decided to adopt a local child; that the baby was his by Elise, Claire, or an unknown woman; or that she was Elise's by Byron. Mary Shelley insisted she would have known if Claire had been pregnant, but it is unclear how much she really knew. The events in Naples, a city Mary Shelley later called a paradise inhabited by devils, remain shrouded in mystery. The only certainty is that she herself was not the child’s mother. Elena Adelaide Shelley died in Naples on 9 June 1820.

After leaving Naples, the Shelleys settled in Rome, the city where her husband wrote where "the meanest streets were strewed with truncated columns, broken capitals...and sparkling fragments of granite or porphyry...The voice of dead time, in still vibrations, is breathed from these dumb things, animated and glorified as they were by man". Rome inspired her to begin writing the unfinished novel "Valerius, the Reanimated Roman", where the eponymous hero resists the decay of Rome and the machinations of "superstitious" Catholicism. The writing of her novel was broken off when her son William died of malaria. Shelley bitterly commented that she had come to Italy to improve her husband's health, and instead the Italian climate had just killed her two children, leading her to write: "May you my dear Marianne never know what it is to lose two only and lovely children in one year-to watch their dying moments-and then at last to be left childless and forever miserable". To deal with her grief, Shelley wrote the novella "The Fields of Fancy", which became "Matilda" dealing with a young woman whose beauty inspired incestuous love in her father, who ultimately commits suicide to stop himself from acting on his passion for his daughter, while she spends the rest of her life full of despair about "the unnatural love I had inspired". The novella offered a feminist critique of a patriarchal society as Matilda is punished in the afterlife though she did nothing to encourage her father's feelings.

In the summer of 1822, a pregnant Mary moved with Percy, Claire, and Edward and Jane Williams to the isolated Villa Magni, at the sea's edge near the hamlet of San Terenzo in the Bay of <a href="Lerici">Lerici</a>. Once they were settled in, Percy broke the "evil news" to Claire that her daughter Allegra had died of <a href="typhus">typhus</a> in a convent at <a href="Bagnacavallo">Bagnacavallo</a>. Mary Shelley was distracted and unhappy in the cramped and remote Villa Magni, which she came to regard as a dungeon. On 16 June, she <a href="miscarriage">miscarried</a>, losing so much blood that she nearly died. Rather than wait for a doctor, Percy sat her in a bath of ice to staunch the bleeding, an act the doctor later told him saved her life. All was not well between the couple that summer, however, and Percy spent more time with Jane Williams than with his depressed and debilitated wife. Most of the short poems Shelley wrote at San Terenzo were addressed to Jane rather than to Mary.

The coast offered Percy Shelley and Edward Williams the chance to enjoy their "perfect plaything for the summer", a new sailing boat. The boat had been designed by Daniel Roberts and <a href="Edward%20John%20Trelawny">Edward Trelawny</a>, an admirer of Byron's who had joined the party in January 1822. On 1 July 1822, Percy Shelley, <a href="Edward%20Ellerker%20Williams">Edward Ellerker Williams</a>, and <a href="Captain%20Daniel%20Roberts">Captain Daniel Roberts</a> sailed south down the coast to <a href="Livorno">Livorno</a>. There Percy Shelley discussed with Byron and <a href="James%20Henry%20Leigh%20Hunt">Leigh Hunt</a> the launch of a radical magazine called "<a href="The%20Liberal">The Liberal</a>". On 8 July, he and Edward Williams set out on the return journey to Lerici with their eighteen-year-old boatboy, Charles Vivian. They never reached their destination. A letter arrived at Villa Magni from Hunt to Percy Shelley, dated 8 July, saying, "pray write to tell us how you got home, for they say you had bad weather after you sailed monday & we are anxious". "The paper fell from me," Mary told a friend later. "I trembled all over." She and Jane Williams rushed desperately to Livorno and then to Pisa in the fading hope that their husbands were still alive. Ten days after the storm, three bodies washed up on the coast near <a href="Viareggio">Viareggio</a>, midway between Livorno and Lerici. Trelawny, Byron, and Hunt <a href="cremation">cremated</a> Percy Shelley’s corpse on the beach at Viareggio.

After her husband's death, Mary Shelley lived for a year with Leigh Hunt and his family in <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a>, where she often saw Byron and transcribed his poems. She resolved to live by her pen and for her son, but her financial situation was precarious. On 23 July 1823, she left Genoa for England and stayed with her father and stepmother in the <a href="Strand%2C%20London">Strand</a> until a small advance from her father-in-law enabled her to lodge nearby. Sir Timothy Shelley had at first agreed to support his grandson, Percy Florence, only if he were handed over to an appointed guardian. Mary Shelley rejected this idea instantly. She managed instead to wring out of Sir Timothy a limited annual allowance (which she had to repay when Percy Florence inherited the estate), but to the end of his days he refused to meet her in person and dealt with her only through lawyers. Mary Shelley busied herself with editing her husband's poems, among other literary endeavours, but concern for her son restricted her options. Sir Timothy threatened to stop the allowance if any biography of the poet were published. In 1826, Percy Florence became the legal heir of the Shelley estate after the death of his half-brother Charles Shelley, his father's son by Harriet Shelley. Sir Timothy raised Mary's allowance from £100 a year to £250 but remained as difficult as ever. Mary Shelley enjoyed the stimulating society of William Godwin's circle, but poverty prevented her from socialising as she wished. She also felt ostracised by those who, like Sir Timothy, still disapproved of her relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley.

In the summer of 1824, Mary Shelley moved to <a href="Kentish%20Town">Kentish Town</a> in north London to be near Jane Williams. She may have been, in the words of her biographer <a href="Muriel%20Spark">Muriel Spark</a>, "a little in love" with Jane. Jane later disillusioned her by gossiping that Percy had preferred her to Mary, owing to Mary's inadequacy as a wife. At around this time, Mary Shelley was working on her novel, "<a href="The%20Last%20Man">The Last Man</a>" (1826); and she assisted a series of friends who were writing memoirs of Byron and Percy Shelley—the beginnings of her attempts to immortalise her husband. She also met the American actor <a href="John%20Howard%20Payne">John Howard Payne</a> and the American writer <a href="Washington%20Irving">Washington Irving</a>, who intrigued her. Payne fell in love with her and in 1826 asked her to marry him. She refused, saying that after being married to one genius, she could only marry another. Payne accepted the rejection and tried without success to talk his friend Irving into proposing himself. Mary Shelley was aware of Payne's plan, but how seriously she took it is unclear.
In 1827, Mary Shelley was party to a scheme that enabled her friend Isabel Robinson and Isabel's lover, <a href="Mary%20Diana%20Dods">Mary Diana Dods</a>, who wrote under the name David Lyndsay, to embark on a life together in France as man and wife. With the help of Payne, whom she kept in the dark about the details, Mary Shelley obtained false passports for the couple. In 1828, she fell ill with <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> while visiting them in Paris. Weeks later she recovered, unscarred but without her youthful beauty.

During the period 1827–40, Mary Shelley was busy as an editor and writer. She wrote the novels "<a href="The%20Fortunes%20of%20Perkin%20Warbeck">The Fortunes of Perkin Warbeck</a>" (1830), "<a href="Lodore">Lodore</a>" (1835), and "<a href="Falkner%20%28novel%29">Falkner</a>" (1837). She contributed five volumes of "<a href="Lives%20of%20the%20Most%20Eminent%20Literary%20and%20Scientific%20Men">Lives</a>" of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and French authors to <a href="Dionysius%20Lardner">Lardner's</a> "<a href="Lives%20of%20the%20Most%20Eminent%20Literary%20and%20Scientific%20Men%23Lardner%27s%20Cabinet%20Cyclopaedia">Cabinet Cyclopaedia</a>". She also wrote stories for ladies' magazines. She was still helping to support her father, and they looked out for publishers for each other. In 1830, she sold the copyright for a new edition of "Frankenstein" for £60 to Henry Colburn and Richard Bentley for their new Standard Novels series. After her father's death in 1836 at the age of eighty, she began assembling his letters and a memoir for publication, as he had requested in his will; but after two years of work, she abandoned the project. Throughout this period, she also championed Percy Shelley's poetry, promoting its publication and quoting it in her writing. By 1837, Percy's works were well-known and increasingly admired. In the summer of 1838 <a href="Edward%20Moxon">Edward Moxon</a>, the publisher of <a href="Alfred%20Tennyson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Tennyson">Tennyson</a> and the son-in-law of <a href="Charles%20Lamb%20%28writer%29">Charles Lamb</a>, proposed publishing a collected works of Percy Shelley. Mary was paid £500 to edit the "Poetical Works" (1838), which Sir Timothy insisted should not include a biography. Mary found a way to tell the story of Percy's life, nonetheless: she included extensive biographical notes about the poems.

Shelley continued to practice her mother's feminist principles by extending aid to women whom society disapproved of. For instance, Shelley extend financial aid to Mary Diana Dods, a single mother and illegitimate herself who appears to have been a lesbian and gave her the new identity of Walter Sholto Douglas, husband of her lover Isabel Robinson. Shelley also assisted Georgiana Paul, a woman disallowed for by her husband for alleged adultery. Shelley in her diary about her assistance to the latter: "I do not make a boast-I do not say aloud-behold my generosity and greatness of mind-for in truth it is simple justice I perform-and so I am still reviled for being worldly".

Mary Shelley continued to treat potential romantic partners with caution. In 1828, she met and flirted with the French writer <a href="Prosper%20M%C3%A9rim%C3%A9e">Prosper Mérimée</a>, but her one surviving letter to him appears to be a deflection of his declaration of love. She was delighted when her old friend from Italy, <a href="Edward%20John%20Trelawny">Edward Trelawny</a>, returned to England, and they joked about marriage in their letters. Their friendship had altered, however, following her refusal to cooperate with his proposed biography of Percy Shelley; and he later reacted angrily to her omission of the atheistic section of "<a href="Queen%20Mab%20%28poem%29">Queen Mab</a>" from Percy Shelley's poems. Oblique references in her journals, from the early 1830s until the early 1840s, suggest that Mary Shelley had feelings for the radical politician <a href="Aubrey%20William%20de%20Vere%20Beauclerk">Aubrey Beauclerk</a>, who may have disappointed her by twice marrying others.

Mary Shelley's first concern during these years was the welfare of Percy Florence. She honoured her late husband's wish that his son attend <a href="Independent%20school%20%28UK%29">public school</a>, and, with Sir Timothy's grudging help, had him educated at <a href="Harrow%20School">Harrow</a>. To avoid boarding fees, she moved to <a href="Harrow%20on%20the%20Hill">Harrow on the Hill</a> herself so that Percy could attend as a day scholar. Though Percy went on to <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, and dabbled in politics and the law, he showed no sign of his parents' gifts. He was devoted to his mother, and after he left university in 1841, he came to live with her.

In 1840 and 1842, mother and son travelled together on the continent, journeys that Mary Shelley recorded in "<a href="Rambles%20in%20Germany%20and%20Italy">Rambles in Germany and Italy in 1840, 1842 and 1843</a>" (1844). In 1844, Sir Timothy Shelley finally died at the age of ninety, "falling from the stalk like an overblown flower", as Mary put it. For the first time, she and her son were financially independent, though the estate proved less valuable than they had hoped.

In the mid-1840s, Mary Shelley found herself the target of three separate blackmailers. In 1845, an Italian political exile called Gatteschi, whom she had met in Paris, threatened to publish letters she had sent him. A friend of her son's bribed a police chief into seizing Gatteschi's papers, including the letters, which were then destroyed. Shortly afterwards, Mary Shelley bought some letters written by herself and Percy Bysshe Shelley from a man calling himself G. Byron and posing as the illegitimate son of the late <a href="George%20Gordon%20Byron%2C%206th%20Baron%20Byron">Lord Byron</a>. Also in 1845, Percy Bysshe Shelley's cousin <a href="Thomas%20Medwin">Thomas Medwin</a> approached her claiming to have written a damaging biography of Percy Shelley. He said he would suppress it in return for £250, but Mary Shelley refused.

In 1848, Percy Florence married Jane Gibson St John. The marriage proved a happy one, and Mary Shelley and Jane were fond of each other. Mary lived with her son and daughter-in-law at Field Place, <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a>, the Shelleys' ancestral home, and at <a href="Chester%20Square">Chester Square</a>, London, and accompanied them on travels abroad.

Mary Shelley's last years were blighted by illness. From 1839, she suffered from headaches and bouts of paralysis in parts of her body, which sometimes prevented her from reading and writing. On 1 February 1851, at Chester Square, she died at the age of fifty-three from what her physician suspected was a brain tumour. According to Jane Shelley, Mary Shelley had asked to be buried with her mother and father; but Percy and Jane, judging the graveyard at <a href="St%20Pancras%20Old%20Church">St Pancras</a> to be "dreadful", chose to bury her instead at <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20Church%2C%20Bournemouth">St Peter's Church, Bournemouth</a>, near their new home at <a href="Boscombe">Boscombe</a>. On the first anniversary of Mary Shelley's death, the Shelleys opened her box-desk. Inside they found locks of her dead children's hair, a notebook she had shared with Percy Bysshe Shelley, and a copy of his poem "<a href="Adona%C3%AFs">Adonaïs</a>" with one page folded round a silk parcel containing some of his ashes and the remains of his heart.

Mary Shelley lived a literary life. Her father encouraged her to learn to write by composing letters, and her favourite occupation as a child was writing stories. Unfortunately, all of Mary's <a href="juvenilia">juvenilia</a> were lost when she ran off with Percy in 1814, and none of her surviving manuscripts can be definitively dated before that year. Her first published work is often thought to have been "<a href="Mounseer%20Nongtongpaw">Mounseer Nongtongpaw</a>", comic verses written for Godwin's "Juvenile Library" when she was ten and a half; however, the poem is attributed to another writer in the most recent authoritative collection of her works. Percy Shelley enthusiastically encouraged Mary Shelley's writing: "My husband was, from the first, very anxious that I should prove myself worthy of my parentage, and enrol myself on the page of fame. He was forever inciting me to obtain literary reputation."

Certain sections of Mary Shelley's novels are often interpreted as masked rewritings of her life. Critics have pointed to the recurrence of the father–daughter <a href="motif%20%28narrative%29">motif</a> in particular as evidence of this autobiographical style. For example, commentators frequently read "<a href="Mathilda%20%28novella%29">Mathilda</a>" (1820) autobiographically, identifying the three central characters as versions of Mary Shelley, William Godwin, and Percy Shelley. Mary Shelley herself confided that she modelled the central characters of "<a href="The%20Last%20Man">The Last Man</a>" on her Italian circle. Lord Raymond, who leaves England to fight for the Greeks and dies in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, is based on <a href="George%20Gordon%20Byron%2C%206th%20Baron%20Byron">Lord Byron</a>; and the <a href="utopia">utopia</a>n Adrian, Earl of Windsor, who leads his followers in search of a natural paradise and dies when his boat sinks in a storm, is a fictional portrait of <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>. However, as she wrote in her review of Godwin's novel "<a href="Cloudesley">Cloudesley</a>" (1830), she did not believe that authors "were merely copying from our own hearts". William Godwin regarded his daughter's characters as <a href="Type%20%28metaphysics%29">types</a> rather than portraits from real life. Some modern critics, such as Patricia Clemit and Jane Blumberg, have taken the same view, resisting autobiographical readings of Mary Shelley's works.

Mary Shelley employed the techniques of many different novelistic genres, most vividly the Godwinian novel, <a href="Walter%20Scott">Walter Scott's</a> new historical novel, and the <a href="Gothic%20fiction">Gothic novel</a>. The Godwinian novel, made popular during the 1790s with works such as Godwin's "<a href="Caleb%20Williams">Caleb Williams</a>" (1794), "employed a Rousseauvian confessional form to explore the contradictory relations between the self and society", and "<a href="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>" exhibits many of the same themes and literary devices as Godwin's novel. However, Shelley critiques those <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> ideals that Godwin promotes in his works. In "The Last Man", she uses the philosophical form of the Godwinian novel to demonstrate the ultimate meaninglessness of the world. While earlier Godwinian novels had shown how rational individuals could slowly improve society, "The Last Man" and "Frankenstein" demonstrate the individual's lack of control over history.

Shelley uses the historical novel to comment on gender relations; for example, "<a href="Valperga%20%28novel%29">Valperga</a>" is a feminist version of Scott's masculinist genre. Introducing women into the story who are not part of the historical record, Shelley uses their narratives to question established theological and political institutions. Shelley sets the male protagonist's compulsive greed for conquest in opposition to a female alternative: reason and <a href="sensibility">sensibility</a>. In "<a href="The%20Fortunes%20of%20Perkin%20Warbeck">Perkin Warbeck</a>", Shelley's other historical novel, Lady Gordon stands for the values of friendship, domesticity, and equality. Through her, Shelley offers a feminine alternative to the masculine power politics that destroy the male characters. The novel provides a more inclusive historical narrative to challenge the one which usually relates only masculine events.

With the rise of <a href="feminist%20literary%20criticism">feminist literary criticism</a> in the 1970s, Mary Shelley's works, particularly "Frankenstein", began to attract much more attention from scholars. Feminist and <a href="psychoanalytic%20theory">psychoanalytic</a> critics were largely responsible for the recovery from neglect of Shelley as a writer. <a href="Ellen%20Moers">Ellen Moers</a> was one of the first to claim that Shelley's loss of a baby was a crucial influence on the writing of "Frankenstein". She argues that the novel is a "birth myth" in which Shelley comes to terms with her guilt for causing her mother's death as well as for failing as a parent. Shelley scholar <a href="Anne%20K.%20Mellor">Anne K. Mellor</a> suggests that, from a feminist viewpoint, it is a story "about what happens when a man tries to have a baby without a woman ... ["Frankenstein"] is profoundly concerned with natural as opposed to unnatural modes of production and reproduction". Victor Frankenstein's failure as a "parent" in the novel has been read as an expression of the anxieties which accompany pregnancy, giving birth, and particularly maternity.

<a href="Sandra%20Gilbert">Sandra Gilbert</a> and <a href="Susan%20Gubar">Susan Gubar</a> argue in their seminal book "<a href="The%20Madwoman%20in%20the%20Attic">The Madwoman in the Attic</a>" (1979) that in "Frankenstein" in particular, Shelley responded to the masculine literary tradition represented by <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton's</a> "<a href="Paradise%20Lost">Paradise Lost</a>". In their interpretation, Shelley reaffirms this masculine tradition, including the misogyny inherent in it, but at the same time "conceal[s] fantasies of equality that occasionally erupt in monstrous images of rage". <a href="Mary%20Poovey">Mary Poovey</a> reads the first edition of "Frankenstein" as part of a larger pattern in Shelley's writing, which begins with literary self-assertion and ends with conventional femininity. Poovey suggests that "Frankenstein"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s multiple narratives enable Shelley to split her artistic persona: she can "express and efface herself at the same time". Shelley's fear of self-assertion is reflected in the fate of Frankenstein, who is punished for his egotism by losing all his domestic ties.

Feminist critics often focus on how authorship itself, particularly female authorship, is represented in and through Shelley's novels. As Mellor explains, Shelley uses the <a href="Gothic%20fiction">Gothic style</a> not only to explore repressed female sexual desire but also as way to "censor her own speech in "Frankenstein"". According to Poovey and Mellor, Shelley did not want to promote her own authorial persona and felt deeply inadequate as a writer, and "this shame contributed to the generation of her fictional images of abnormality, perversion, and destruction".

Shelley's writings focus on the role of the family in society and women's role within that family. She celebrates the "feminine affections and compassion" associated with the family and suggests that civil society will fail without them. Shelley was "profoundly committed to an ethic of cooperation, mutual dependence, and self-sacrifice". In "<a href="Lodore">Lodore</a>", for example, the central story follows the fortunes of the wife and daughter of the title character, Lord Lodore, who is killed in a duel at the end of the first volume, leaving a trail of legal, financial, and familial obstacles for the two "heroines" to negotiate. The novel is engaged with political and ideological issues, particularly the education and social role of women. It dissects a <a href="patriarchal">patriarchal</a> culture that separated the sexes and pressured women into dependence on men. In the view of Shelley scholar <a href="Betty%20T.%20Bennett">Betty T. Bennett</a>, "the novel proposes egalitarian educational paradigms for women and men, which would bring social justice as well as the spiritual and intellectual means by which to meet the challenges life invariably brings". However, "<a href="Falkner%20%28novel%29">Falkner</a>" is the only one of Mary Shelley's novels in which the heroine's agenda triumphs. The novel's resolution proposes that when female values triumph over violent and destructive masculinity, men will be freed to express the "compassion, sympathy, and generosity" of their better natures.

"Frankenstein", like much <a href="Gothic%20fiction">Gothic fiction</a> of the period, mixes a <a href="wikt%3Avisceral">visceral</a> and alienating subject matter with speculative and thought-provoking themes. Rather than focusing on the twists and turns of the plot, however, the novel foregrounds the mental and moral struggles of the <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a>, Victor Frankenstein, and Shelley imbues the text with her own brand of politicised <a href="Romanticism">Romanticism</a>, one that criticised the individualism and egotism of traditional Romanticism. Victor Frankenstein is like Satan in "<a href="Paradise%20Lost">Paradise Lost</a>", and <a href="Prometheus">Prometheus</a>: he rebels against tradition; he creates life; and he shapes his own destiny. These traits are not portrayed positively; as Blumberg writes, "his relentless ambition is a self-delusion, clothed as quest for truth". He must abandon his family to fulfill his ambition.

Mary Shelley believed in the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> idea that people could improve society through the responsible exercise of political power, but she feared that the irresponsible exercise of power would lead to chaos. In practice, her works largely criticise the way 18th-century thinkers such as her parents believed such change could be brought about. The creature in "Frankenstein", for example, reads books associated with radical ideals but the education he gains from them is ultimately useless. Shelley's works reveal her as less optimistic than Godwin and Wollstonecraft; she lacks faith in Godwin's theory that humanity could eventually be perfected.

As literary scholar Kari Lokke writes, "The Last Man", more so than "Frankenstein", "in its refusal to place humanity at the center of the universe, its questioning of our privileged position in relation to nature ... constitutes a profound and prophetic challenge to Western humanism." Specifically, Mary Shelley's allusions to what radicals believed was a failed <a href="French%20Revolution">revolution in France</a> and the Godwinian, Wollstonecraftian, and <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Burkean</a> responses to it, challenge "Enlightenment faith in the inevitability of progress through collective efforts". As in "Frankenstein", Shelley "offers a profoundly disenchanted commentary on the age of revolution, which ends in a total rejection of the progressive ideals of her own generation". Not only does she reject these Enlightenment political ideals, but she also rejects the Romantic notion that the poetic or literary imagination can offer an alternative.

Critics have until recently cited "Lodore" and "Falkner" as evidence of increasing conservatism in Mary Shelley's later works. In 1984, <a href="Mary%20Poovey">Mary Poovey</a> influentially identified the retreat of Mary Shelley’s reformist politics into the "separate sphere" of the domestic. Poovey suggested that Mary Shelley wrote "Falkner" to resolve her conflicted response to her father's combination of <a href="Libertarianism">libertarian</a> radicalism and stern insistence on social decorum. Mellor largely agreed, arguing that "Mary Shelley grounded her alternative political ideology on the metaphor of the peaceful, loving, bourgeois family. She thereby implicitly endorsed a conservative vision of gradual evolutionary reform." This vision allowed women to participate in the public sphere but it inherited the inequalities inherent in the <a href="bourgeois">bourgeois</a> family.

However, in the last decade or so this view has been challenged. For example, Bennett claims that Mary Shelley's works reveal a consistent commitment to Romantic idealism and political reform and Jane Blumberg's study of Shelley's early novels argues that her career cannot be easily divided into radical and conservative halves. She contends that "Shelley was never a passionate radical like her husband and her later lifestyle was not abruptly assumed nor was it a betrayal. She was in fact challenging the political and literary influences of her circle in her first work." In this reading, Shelley's early works are interpreted as a challenge to Godwin and Percy Bysshe Shelley's radicalism. Victor Frankenstein's "thoughtless rejection of family", for example, is seen as evidence of Shelley's constant concern for the domestic.

In the 1820s and 1830s, Mary Shelley frequently wrote <a href="short%20stories">short stories</a> for <a href="gift%20book">gift book</a>s or annuals, including sixteen for "The Keepsake", which was aimed at middle-class women and bound in silk, with <a href="Gilding">gilt</a>-edged pages. Mary Shelley's work in this genre has been described as that of a "hack writer" and "wordy and pedestrian". However, critic Charlotte Sussman points out that other leading writers of the day, such as the <a href="Romantic%20poetry">Romantic poets</a> <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>, also took advantage of this profitable market. She explains that "the annuals were a major mode of literary production in the 1820s and 1830s", with "The Keepsake" the most successful.

Many of Shelley's stories are set in places or times far removed from early 19th-century Britain, such as Greece and the reign of <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20France">Henry IV of France</a>. Shelley was particularly interested in "the fragility of individual identity" and often depicted "the way a person's role in the world can be cataclysmically altered either by an internal emotional upheaval, or by some supernatural occurrence that mirrors an internal schism". In her stories, female identity is tied to a woman's short-lived value in the marriage market while male identity can be sustained and transformed through the use of money. Although Mary Shelley wrote twenty-one short stories for the annuals between 1823 and 1839, she always saw herself, above all, as a novelist. She wrote to <a href="James%20Henry%20Leigh%20Hunt">Leigh Hunt</a>, "I write bad articles which help to make me miserable—but I am going to plunge into a novel and hope that its clear water will wash off the mud of the magazines."

When they ran off to France in the summer of 1814, Mary Godwin and Percy Shelley began a joint journal, which they published in 1817 under the title "History of a Six Weeks' Tour", adding four letters, two by each of them, based on their visit to <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> in 1816, along with Percy Shelley's poem "<a href="Mont%20Blanc%20%28poem%29">Mont Blanc</a>". The work celebrates youthful love and political idealism and consciously follows the example of <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a> and others who had combined travelling with writing. The perspective of the "History" is philosophical and reformist rather than that of a conventional <a href="Travel%20literature">travelogue</a>; in particular, it addresses the effects of politics and war on France. The letters the couple wrote on the second journey confront the "great and extraordinary events" of the final defeat of <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon</a> at <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Waterloo</a> after his "<a href="Hundred%20Days">Hundred Days</a>" return in 1815. They also explore the <a href="Sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublimity</a> of <a href="Lake%20Geneva">Lake Geneva</a> and <a href="Mont%20Blanc">Mont Blanc</a> as well as the revolutionary legacy of the philosopher and novelist <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>.

Mary Shelley's last full-length book, written in the form of letters and published in 1844, was "Rambles in Germany and Italy in 1840, 1842 and 1843", which recorded her travels with her son Percy Florence and his university friends. In "Rambles", Shelley follows the tradition of Mary Wollstonecraft's "<a href="Letters%20Written%20in%20Sweden%2C%20Norway%2C%20and%20Denmark">Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</a>" and her own "A History of a Six Weeks' Tour" in mapping her personal and political landscape through the discourse of <a href="sensibility">sensibility</a> and sympathy. For Shelley, building sympathetic connections between people is the way to build civil society and to increase knowledge: "knowledge, to enlighten and free the mind from clinging deadening prejudices—a wider circle of sympathy with our fellow-creatures;—these are the uses of travel". Between observations on scenery, culture, and "the people, especially in a political point of view", she uses the travelogue form to explore her roles as a widow and mother and to reflect on revolutionary nationalism in Italy. She also records her "pilgrimage" to scenes associated with Percy Shelley. According to critic Clarissa Orr, Mary Shelley's adoption of a persona of philosophical motherhood gives "Rambles" the unity of a prose poem, with "death and memory as central themes". At the same time, Shelley makes an <a href="egalitarian">egalitarian</a> case against monarchy, class distinctions, slavery, and war.

Between 1832 and 1839, Mary Shelley wrote many biographies of notable Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and French men and a few women for <a href="Dionysius%20Lardner">Dionysius Lardner's</a> "<a href="Lives%20of%20the%20Most%20Eminent%20Literary%20and%20Scientific%20Men">Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men</a>". These formed part of Lardner's "<a href="Lives%20of%20the%20Most%20Eminent%20Literary%20and%20Scientific%20Men%23Lardner%27s%20Cabinet%20Cyclopaedia">Cabinet Cyclopaedia</a>", one of the best of many such series produced in the 1820s and 1830s in response to growing middle-class demand for self-education. Until the republication of these essays in 2002, their significance within her body of work was not appreciated. In the view of literary scholar Greg Kucich, they reveal Mary Shelley's "prodigious research across several centuries and in multiple languages", her gift for biographical narrative, and her interest in the "emerging forms of feminist historiography". Shelley wrote in a biographical style popularised by the 18th-century critic <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a> in his "<a href="Lives%20of%20the%20Poets">Lives of the Poets</a>" (1779–81), combining secondary sources, <a href="memoir">memoir</a> and anecdote, and authorial evaluation. She records details of each writer's life and character, quotes their writing in the original as well as in translation, and ends with a critical assessment of their achievement.

For Shelley, biographical writing was supposed to, in her words, "form as it were a school in which to study the philosophy of history", and to teach "lessons". Most frequently and importantly, these lessons consisted of criticisms of male-dominated institutions such as <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a>. Shelley emphasises domesticity, romance, family, sympathy, and compassion in the lives of her subjects. Her conviction that such forces could improve society connects her biographical approach with that of other early feminist historians such as <a href="Mary%20Hays">Mary Hays</a> and <a href="Anna%20Jameson">Anna Jameson</a>. Unlike her novels, most of which had an original print run of several hundred copies, the "Lives" had a print run of about 4,000 for each volume: thus, according to Kucich, Mary Shelley's "use of biography to forward the social agenda of women's historiography became one of her most influential political interventions".

Soon after Percy Shelley's death, Mary Shelley determined to write his biography. In a letter of 17 November 1822, she announced: "I shall write his life—& thus occupy myself in the only manner from which I can derive consolation." However, her father-in-law, Sir Timothy Shelley, effectively banned her from doing so. Mary began her fostering of Percy's poetic reputation in 1824 with the publication of his "Posthumous Poems". In 1839, while she was working on the "Lives", she prepared a new edition of his poetry, which became, in the words of literary scholar <a href="Susan%20J.%20Wolfson">Susan J. Wolfson</a>, "the canonizing event" in the history of her husband's reputation. The following year, Mary Shelley edited a volume of her husband's essays, letters, translations, and fragments, and throughout the 1830s, she introduced his poetry to a wider audience by publishing assorted works in the annual "The Keepsake".

Evading Sir Timothy's ban on a biography, Mary Shelley often included in these editions her own <a href="annotations">annotations</a> and reflections on her husband's life and work. "I am to justify his ways," she had declared in 1824; "I am to make him beloved to all posterity." It was this goal, argues Blumberg, that led her to present Percy's work to the public in the "most popular form possible". To tailor his works for a <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> audience, she cast Percy Shelley as a <a href="lyric%20poetry">lyrical</a> rather than a political poet. As Mary Favret writes, "the disembodied Percy identifies the spirit of poetry itself". Mary glossed Percy's political radicalism as a form of <a href="sentimentalism%20%28literature%29">sentimentalism</a>, arguing that his <a href="republicanism">republicanism</a> arose from sympathy for those who were suffering. She inserted romantic anecdotes of his benevolence, domesticity, and love of the natural world. Portraying herself as Percy's "practical muse", she also noted how she had suggested revisions as he wrote.

Despite the emotions stirred by this task, Mary Shelley arguably proved herself in many respects a professional and scholarly editor. Working from Percy's messy, sometimes indecipherable, notebooks, she attempted to form a chronology for his writings, and she included poems, such as "Epipsychidion", addressed to Emilia Viviani, which she would rather have left out. She was forced, however, into several compromises, and, as Blumberg notes, "modern critics have found fault with the edition and claim variously that she miscopied, misinterpreted, purposely obscured, and attempted to turn the poet into something he was not". According to Wolfson, Donald Reiman, a modern editor of Percy Bysshe Shelley's works, still refers to Mary Shelley's editions, while acknowledging that her editing style belongs "to an age of editing when the aim was not to establish accurate texts and scholarly apparatus but to present a full record of a writer's career for the general reader". In principle, Mary Shelley believed in publishing every last word of her husband's work; but she found herself obliged to omit certain passages, either by pressure from her publisher, <a href="Edward%20Moxon">Edward Moxon</a>, or in deference to public propriety. For example, she removed the <a href="atheism">atheistic</a> passages from "<a href="Queen%20Mab%20%28poem%29">Queen Mab</a>" for the first edition. After she restored them in the second edition, Moxon was prosecuted and convicted of <a href="blasphemous%20libel">blasphemous libel</a>, though the prosecution was brought out of principle by the <a href="Chartism">Chartist</a> publisher <a href="Henry%20Hetherington">Henry Hetherington</a>, and no punishment was sought. Mary Shelley's omissions provoked criticism, often stinging, from members of Percy Shelley's former circle, and reviewers accused her of, among other things, indiscriminate inclusions. Her notes have nevertheless remained an essential source for the study of Percy Shelley's work. As Bennett explains, "biographers and critics agree that Mary Shelley's commitment to bring Shelley the notice she believed his works merited was the single, major force that established Shelley's reputation during a period when he almost certainly would have faded from public view".

In her own lifetime, Mary Shelley was taken seriously as a writer, though reviewers often missed her writings' political edge. After her death, however, she was chiefly remembered as the wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley and as the author of "Frankenstein". In fact, in the introduction to her letters published in 1945, editor Frederick Jones wrote, "a collection of the present size could not be justified by the general quality of the letters or by Mary Shelley's importance as a writer. It is as the wife of [Percy Bysshe Shelley] that she excites our interest." This attitude had not disappeared by 1980 when <a href="Betty%20T.%20Bennett">Betty T. Bennett</a> published the first volume of Mary Shelley's complete letters. As she explains, "the fact is that until recent years scholars have generally regarded Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley as a result: William Godwin's and Mary Wollstonecraft's daughter who became Shelley's <a href="Pygmalion%20%28mythology%29">Pygmalion</a>." It was not until Emily Sunstein's "Mary Shelley: Romance and Reality" in 1989 that a full-length scholarly biography was published.

The attempts of Mary Shelley's son and daughter-in-law to "Victorianise" her memory by censoring biographical documents contributed to a perception of Mary Shelley as a more conventional, less reformist figure than her works suggest. Her own timid omissions from Percy Shelley's works and her quiet avoidance of public controversy in her later years added to this impression. Commentary by <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson%20Hogg">Hogg</a>, <a href="Edward%20John%20Trelawny">Trelawny</a>, and other admirers of Percy Shelley also tended to downplay Mary Shelley's radicalism. Trelawny's "Records of Shelley, Byron, and the Author" (1878) praised Percy Shelley at the expense of Mary, questioning her intelligence and even her authorship of "Frankenstein". Lady Shelley, Percy Florence's wife, responded in part by presenting a severely edited collection of letters she had inherited, published privately as "Shelley and Mary" in 1882.

From "Frankenstein"'s first theatrical adaptation in 1823 to the cinematic adaptations of the 20th century, including the <a href="Frankenstein%20%281910%20film%29">first cinematic version in 1910</a> and now-famous versions such as <a href="James%20Whale">James Whale's</a> 1931 "<a href="Frankenstein%20%281931%20film%29">Frankenstein</a>", <a href="Mel%20Brooks">Mel Brooks</a>' 1974 "<a href="Young%20Frankenstein">Young Frankenstein</a>", and <a href="Kenneth%20Branagh">Kenneth Branagh's</a> 1994 "<a href="Frankenstein%20%281994%20film%29">Mary Shelley's Frankenstein</a>", many audiences first encounter the work of Mary Shelley through adaptation. Over the course of the 19th century, Mary Shelley came to be seen as a one-novel author at best, rather than as the professional writer she was; most of her works have remained out of print until the last thirty years, obstructing a larger view of her achievement. In recent decades, the republication of almost all her writing has stimulated a new recognition of its value. Her habit of intensive reading and study, revealed in her journals and letters and reflected in her works, is now better appreciated. Shelley's conception of herself as an author has also been recognised; after Percy's death, she wrote of her authorial ambitions: "I think that I can maintain myself, and there is something inspiriting in the idea." Scholars now consider Mary Shelley to be a major <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> figure, significant for her literary achievement and her political voice as a woman and a liberal.

Underground Electric Railways Company of London

The Underground Electric Railways Company of London Limited (UERL), known operationally as the Underground for much of its existence, was established in 1902. It was the <a href="holding%20company">holding company</a> for the three deep-level "tube" underground railway lines opened in London during 1906 and 1907: the <a href="Baker%20Street%20and%20Waterloo%20Railway">Baker Street and Waterloo Railway</a>, the <a href="Charing%20Cross%2C%20Euston%20and%20Hampstead%20Railway">Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway</a> and the <a href="Great%20Northern%2C%20Piccadilly%20and%20Brompton%20Railway">Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway</a>. It was also the parent company from 1902 of the <a href="District%20Railway">District Railway</a>, which it electrified between 1903 and 1905. The UERL is a precursor of today's <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>; its three tube lines form the central sections of today's <a href="Bakerloo%20line">Bakerloo</a>, <a href="Northern%20line">Northern</a> and <a href="Piccadilly%20line">Piccadilly</a> lines.

The UERL struggled financially in the first years after the opening of its lines and narrowly avoided bankruptcy in 1908 by restructuring its debt. A policy of expansion by acquisition was followed before World War I, so that the company came to operate the majority of the underground railway lines in and around London. It also controlled large bus and tram fleets, the profits from which subsidised the financially weaker railways. After the war, railway extensions took the UERL's services out into suburban areas to stimulate additional passenger numbers, so that, by the early 1930s, the company's lines stretched beyond the <a href="County%20of%20London">County of London</a> and served destinations in <a href="Middlesex">Middlesex</a>, <a href="Essex">Essex</a>, <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a> and <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>.

In the 1920s, competition from small unregulated bus operators reduced the profitability of the road transport operations, leading the UERL's directors to seek government regulation. This led to the establishment of the <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Passenger Transport Board</a> in 1933, which absorbed the UERL and all of the independent and municipally operated railway, bus and tram services in the London area.

The first deep-level tube railway, the <a href="City%20%26amp%3B%20South%20London%20Railway">City & South London Railway</a> (C&SLR), opened in 1890. Its early success resulted in a rush of proposals to <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> for other deep-level routes under the capital, but by 1901 only two more lines had opened: the <a href="Waterloo%20%26amp%3B%20City%20Railway">Waterloo & City Railway</a> (W&CR) in 1898 and the <a href="Central%20London%20Railway">Central London Railway</a> (CLR) in 1900. Construction had started on one other line and then stopped following a financial crisis. The rest of the companies were struggling to raise funding.

The <a href="District%20Railway">District Railway</a> (DR) was a sub-surface underground railway which had opened in 1868. Its steam-hauled services operated around the "<a href="Inner%20Circle%20%28London%20Underground%29">Inner Circle</a>" and on branches to <a href="Hounslow%20West%20tube%20station">Hounslow</a>, <a href="Wimbledon%20station">Wimbledon</a>, <a href="Richmond%20station%20%28London%29">Richmond</a>, <a href="Ealing%20Broadway%20station">Ealing</a>, <a href="Whitechapel%20station">Whitechapel</a> and <a href="New%20Cross%20Gate%20railway%20station">New Cross</a>. By 1901, the DR was struggling to compete with emerging <a href="motor%20bus">motor bus</a> and electric <a href="tram">tram</a> companies and the CLR which were eroding its passenger traffic. To become more competitive, the DR was contemplating a programme of <a href="Railway%20electrification%20system">electrification</a>, although it was not financially strong enough to raise the capital to carry out the work on its own. It also had parliamentary approval for a congestion-relieving deep-level line that was to run beneath its existing route between <a href="Gloucester%20Road%20tube%20station">Gloucester Road</a> and <a href="Mansion%20House%20tube%20station">Mansion House</a>.

By 1898, American financier <a href="Charles%20Yerkes">Charles Tyson Yerkes</a> had made a large fortune developing the electric tramway and <a href="The%20Loop%20%28CTA%29">elevated railway</a> systems in Chicago, but his questionable business methods, which included bribery and blackmail, had finally drawn the disapproving attention of the public. Yerkes had unsuccessfully attempted to bribe the city council and Illinois state legislature into granting him a 100-year franchise for the tramway system. Following a public backlash, he sold his Chicago investments and turned his attention to opportunities in London.

Yerkes' first acquisition in London was the <a href="Charing%20Cross%2C%20Euston%20and%20Hampstead%20Railway">Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway</a> (CCE&HR). The company had parliamentary permission to build a deep-level tube railway from <a href="Charing%20Cross">Charing Cross</a> to <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a> and <a href="Highgate">Highgate</a>, but had been unable to raise the finance, selling only a tiny fraction of the shares available. <a href="Robert%20Perks">Robert Perks</a>, a solicitor for a number of railway companies and <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament%23United%20Kingdom">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="Louth%2C%20Lincolnshire%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Louth</a>, had suggested the CCE&HR to Yerkes and the American's consortium bought the company for £100,000 (approximately £ today) on 28 September 1900.

Perks was also a large shareholder in Yerkes' next target, the <a href="Metropolitan%20District%20Railway">Metropolitan District Railway</a>, usually known as the District Railway or DR. By March 1901, the syndicate had acquired a controlling interest in the DR and made a proposal for its electrification. Yerkes established the Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company (MDETC) on 15 July 1901 with himself as managing director. The company raised £1 million (£ today) to carry out the electrification works including the construction of the generating station and supplying the new electric rolling stock. In September 1901, Perks became the DR's chairman.

The <a href="Brompton%20and%20Piccadilly%20Circus%20Railway">Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway</a> (B&PCR) was a tube railway company which had been purchased by the DR in 1898, but had remained a separate financial entity. It had permission to construct a line from <a href="South%20Kensington%20tube%20station">South Kensington</a> to <a href="Piccadilly%20Circus%20tube%20station">Piccadilly Circus</a>, but had not raised the capital to do so. At South Kensington it was to connect to the deep level line planned by the DR. On 12 September 1901, the DR-controlled board of the B&PCR sold the company to the MDETC. In the same month, the B&PCR took over the <a href="Great%20Northern%20and%20Strand%20Railway">Great Northern and Strand Railway</a> (GN&SR), a tube railway with permission to build a line from <a href="Aldwych%20tube%20station">Strand</a> to <a href="Finsbury%20Park%20station">Finsbury Park</a>. The routes of the B&PCR and GN&SR were subsequently linked and combined with part of the DR's tube route to create the <a href="Great%20Northern%2C%20Piccadilly%20and%20Brompton%20Railway">Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway</a> (GNP&BR).

Yerkes' final purchase was the <a href="Baker%20Street%20and%20Waterloo%20Railway">Baker Street and Waterloo Railway</a> (BS&WR) in March 1902 for £360,000 (£ today). The BS&WR had permission to construct a line from <a href="London%20Paddington%20station">Paddington</a> to <a href="Elephant%20%26amp%3B%20Castle%20tube%20station">Elephant & Castle</a> and, unlike his other tube railway purchases, construction work had started in 1898. Substantial progress had been made before it was stopped following the collapse of the BS&WR's parent company, the London & Globe Finance Corporation, due to the fraud of its managing director <a href="Whitaker%20Wright">Whitaker Wright</a> in 1900. With a varied collection of companies under his control, Yerkes established the UERL in April 1902 to take control of them all and manage the planned works, and took the position of chairman. On 8 June 1902, the UERL took over the MDETC and paid off the company's shareholders with cash and UERL shares.

The UERL was set up with an initial <a href="investment">capitalisation</a> of £5 million (£ today). The company was backed by three merchant banks, Speyer Brothers in London, Speyer & Co. in New York and Old Colony Trust Company in Boston, each of which was to receive £250,000 from the capital raised. Almost 60 per cent of the initial share offering was bought in the United States, with a third sold in Britain and the rest mainly in the Netherlands. Further capital was soon needed for the construction works and additional share and bond issues followed. The UERL eventually raised a total of £18 million (£ today).

Like many of Yerkes' schemes in the United States, the structure of the UERL's finances was highly complex and involved the use of novel financial instruments. One method, used by Yerkes to raise £7 million, was "profit-sharing secured notes", a form of bond which was secured against the value of shares. They were sold at a 4 per cent discount, paid 5 per cent interest and were due for repayment in 1908. The assumption was that shares would inevitably rise in value once the UERL's tube railways were operational and producing a profit. Investors in the notes would gain the double benefit of the growth in share price and interest.

Before its takeover, the DR had carried out some joint electrification experiments with the <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway">Metropolitan Railway</a> (MR), the other sub-surface line with which the DR shared the "Inner Circle". A section of track between <a href="Earl%27s%20Court%20tube%20station">Earl's Court</a> and <a href="High%20Street%20Kensington%20tube%20station">High Street Kensington</a> was electrified with a <a href="Railway%20electrification%20system%23Fourth%20rail">four-rail system</a> and a jointly owned test train operated a shuttle service between February and November 1900. Having proven the practicality of electric traction, the two companies set up a joint committee to select a supplier of equipment for the electrification of their networks.

The committee's preferred system was a 3,000 <a href="volt">volt</a>, <a href="three-phase">three-phase</a> <a href="alternating%20current">alternating current</a> system proposed by <a href="Hungary">Hungarian</a> electrical engineering company <a href="Ganz">Ganz</a>. The system delivered current by overhead conductor wires and was cheaper than alternatives using power rails and required fewer electrical sub-stations. An experimental line had been constructed by Ganz in <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a>, although the system had not yet been adopted for the full-scale operation of a railway. Before the appointment of Ganz could be finalised, Yerkes took control of the DR. He and his engineers preferred the low voltage <a href="direct%20current">direct current</a> conductor rail system they had worked with in the United States and were intending to use on the tube lines when they were constructed; they rejected the Ganz system putting the DR and the MDETC into dispute with the MR which wanted to proceed with the Ganz system. After some acrimonious debate between the two companies, some of which was carried out in public through the letters pages of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" newspaper, the dispute went to arbitration at the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a>. The decision was made in December 1901 to use the four-rail system, although the arbitrator, <a href="Alfred%20Lyttelton">Alfred Lyttelton</a>, was critical of the DR's unilateral decision.

Victorious, the MDETC quickly began the electrification of the DR's tracks, starting with an extension from <a href="Ealing%20Common%20tube%20station">Ealing Common</a> to <a href="South%20Harrow%20tube%20station">South Harrow</a> that opened with its first electric service in June 1903. Conversion of the rest of the DR's tracks was completed in mid-1905, although failure to coordinate installations with the MR meant that the first electric services on the "Inner Circle" from 1 July 1905 were disrupted for several months due to equipment failures on the MR's trains. Power came from the UERL's own <a href="Lots%20Road%20Power%20Station">Lots Road Power Station</a> on <a href="Counter%27s%20Creek">Chelsea Creek</a>. Originally planned by the B&PCR, construction of the power station began in 1902 and finished in December 1904. It became operational on 1 February 1905, generating three-phase alternating current at 11,000 volts, which was converted to 550 volts direct current at track-side transformers located around the network. The power station was constructed large enough to power all of the UERL's lines once they opened plus others later. By the time the last of the DR's steam trains were retired on 5 November 1905, the UERL had spent £1.7 million (£ today) on the electrification of the line.

With funds in place, construction of the BS&WR was quickly restarted. 50 per cent of the tunnelling and 25 per cent of the station work had been completed before work had been stopped, and by February 1904 virtually all of the tunnels and underground parts of the stations between Elephant & Castle and <a href="Marylebone%20station">Marylebone</a> were complete and works on the station buildings were under way. Construction of the GNP&BR and the CCE&HR began in July 1902 and proceeded quickly so that the UERL was able to record in its annual report in October 1904 that 80 per cent of the GNP&BR's and 75 per cent of the CCE&HR's tunnels had been completed.

Following the pattern adopted by the earlier tube lines, each of the UERL's lines was constructed as a pair of circular tunnels using <a href="tunnelling%20shield">tunnelling shield</a>s with segmental cast iron tunnel linings bolted together and <a href="grout">grout</a>ed into place as the shield advanced. Generally the tunnels followed surface roads and were constructed side by side, but where the width of the road above was insufficient, tunnels were placed one above the other. Stations on all three lines were provided with surface buildings designed by the UERL's architect <a href="Leslie%20Green">Leslie Green</a> in a standardised style modified for each site. These consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed <a href="glazed%20architectural%20terra-cotta">terracotta</a> blocks with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The stations had flat roofs and were designed to accommodate upward extension for commercial development. Most stations were provided with between two and four <a href="elevator">lifts</a> and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft. At platform level, the wall tiling featured the station name and an individual geometric pattern and colour scheme designed by Green.

The UERL used a <a href="Westinghouse%20Electric%20%281886%29">Westinghouse</a> automatic signalling system operated through electrified <a href="track%20circuit">track circuit</a>s. This controlled signals based on the presence or absence of a train on the track ahead. Signals incorporated an arm that was raised when the signal was red. If a train failed to stop at a red signal, the arm would activate a "<a href="train%20stop">tripcock</a>" on the train; applying the brakes automatically.

Apart from the electrification of the DR, Yerkes did not live to see the completion of the fast-paced construction works that he set in motion; he died in New York on 29 December 1905 and was replaced as UERL chairman by <a href="Edgar%20Speyer">Edgar Speyer</a>. Speyer was chairman of the UERL's backer Speyer Brothers and a partner in Speyer & Co. <a href="George%20Gibb">Sir George Gibb</a>, general manager of the <a href="North%20Eastern%20Railway%20%28UK%29">North Eastern Railway</a>, was appointed managing director. The BS&WR opened to passengers on 10 March 1906. The GNP&BR followed on 15 December 1906, with the CCE&HR on 22 June 1907. The three tube lines quickly came to be known as the Bakerloo Tube, Piccadilly Tube and Hampstead Tube.

Yerkes also did not live to see the UERL's financial struggle during the first years after the opening of the new lines. Because of greatly over-optimistic pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers, the lines failed to generate the income expected and needed to fund the interest payments on the UERL's substantial borrowings. In the Bakerloo Tube's first twelve months of operation, it carried 20.5 million passengers, less than sixty per cent of the 35 million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The Piccadilly Tube achieved 26 million of a predicted 60 million and the Hampstead Tube managed 25 million of a predicted 50 million. For the DR, the UERL had predicted an increase to 100 million passengers after electrification, but achieved 55 million. The lower than expected passenger numbers were partly due to competition between the UERL's lines and those of the other tube and sub-surface railway companies, and the further spread of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took a large number of passengers away from the trains. The low price of tickets also depressed income.

The crisis point for the UERL was the need to redeem the five-year profit-sharing secured notes on 30 June 1908. The UERL did not have the money. Speyer unsuccessfully tried to persuade the <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a> (LCC) to inject £5 million into the UERL and used some of his own bank's money to pay-off disgruntled shareholders threatening bankruptcy proceedings. Eventually, Speyer and Gibb managed to obtain agreement from the shareholders to convert the notes into long-term debt to be repaid in 1933 and 1948.

As Speyer and Gibb worked to restructure the debt, the UERL's general manager, <a href="Albert%20Stanley%2C%201st%20Baron%20Ashfield">Albert Stanley</a>, appointed by Gibb in 1907, began to increase the UERL's income by improving management structures. With commercial manager <a href="Frank%20Pick">Frank Pick</a>, Stanley instigated a plan to increase passenger numbers; developing the "Underground" brand and establishing a joint booking system and coordinated fares throughout all of London's underground railways, including those not controlled by the UERL. 
In 1909, the UERL overcame the objections of previously reluctant American investors, and announced a parliamentary <a href="bill%20%28proposed%20law%29">bill</a> for the formal merger of the Bakerloo, Hampstead and Piccadilly Tube lines into a single company, the <a href="London%20Electric%20Railway">London Electric Railway</a> Company (LER). This bill received <a href="Royal%20Assent">Royal Assent</a> and was enacted on 26 July 1910 as the "London Electric Railway Amalgamation Act, 1910", The DR was not merged with the tube lines and remained a separate company. 

As managing director of the UERL from 1910, Stanley led further transport consolidation with the UERL's take-over of <a href="London%20General%20Omnibus%20Company">London General Omnibus Company</a> (LGOC) in 1912 and the CLR and the C&SLR on 1 January 1913. The LGOC was the dominant bus operator in the capital and its high profitability (it paid dividends of 18 per cent compared with Underground Group companies' dividends of 1 to 3 per cent) subsidised the rest of the group. Through the UERL's shareholding in the London and Suburban Traction Company (LSTC), which it owned jointly with <a href="British%20Electric%20Traction">British Electric Traction</a>, the UERL took control in 1913 of the <a href="London%20United%20Tramways">London United Tramways</a>, the <a href="Metropolitan%20Electric%20Tramways">Metropolitan Electric Tramways</a> and the <a href="South%20Metropolitan%20Electric%20Tramways">South Metropolitan Electric Tramways</a>. The UERL also took control of bus builder <a href="Associated%20Equipment%20Company">AEC</a>. The much enlarged group became known as the Combine. Only the MR (and its subsidiaries the Great Northern & City Railway and the East London Railway) and the W&CR (by then fully owned by the <a href="London%20and%20South%20Western%20Railway">London and South Western Railway</a>) remained outside of the Underground Group's control.

Another way in which the UERL tried to improve income was the construction of extensions to its lines to generate additional passenger traffic, often through the stimulation of new housing developments in the areas through which the lines ran. 
The DR was extended to <a href="Uxbridge%20tube%20station">Uxbridge</a> in 1910, by a connection made to the MR. In 1913, the Bakerloo Tube was extended to <a href="London%20Paddington%20station">Paddington</a> and to <a href="Queen%27s%20Park%20%28London%29%20station">Queen's Park</a> and <a href="Watford%20Junction%20railway%20station">Watford Junction</a> four years later. The Hampstead tube was extended a short distance at its southern end to provide an interchange with the Bakerloo and the DR at <a href="Embankment%20tube%20station">Embankment</a> in 1914. It was extended at its northern end from <a href="Golders%20Green%20tube%20station">Golders Green</a> into the Middlesex countryside to reach <a href="Edgware%20tube%20station">Edgware</a> in 1924. In 1926, the Hampstead tube was extended south to connect to the C&SLR at <a href="Kennington%20tube%20station">Kennington</a> in conjunction with a reconstruction of the C&SLR and its 1926 extension from <a href="Clapham%20Common%20tube%20station">Clapham Common</a> to <a href="Morden%20tube%20station">Morden</a>. The CLR was extended to <a href="Ealing%20Broadway%20station">Ealing Broadway</a> in 1920. Permission for an <a href="Central%20London%20Railway%23Richmond%2C%201913%20and%201920">extension of the line to Richmond</a> was obtained in 1913 and again in 1920, but was not used. Later, during 1932 and 1933, the Piccadilly Tube was extended at both ends: in the north from Finsbury Park to <a href="Cockfosters%20tube%20station">Cockfosters</a>, and in the west from Hammersmith to Hounslow and Uxbridge using the DR's tracks.

In addition, a programme of modernising many of the Underground's busiest central London stations was started; providing them with escalators to replace lifts. New and refurbished rolling stock was gradually introduced on a number of lines with automatic sliding doors along the length of the carriages instead of manual end gates, reducing boarding times. By the middle of the 1920s, the organisation had expanded to such an extent that a large, new headquarters building designed by <a href="Charles%20Holden">Charles Holden</a> was constructed at <a href="55%20Broadway%2C%20London">55 Broadway</a> over <a href="St.%20James%27s%20Park%20tube%20station">St. James's Park station</a>.
Starting in the early 1920s, competition from numerous small bus companies, nicknamed "pirates" because they operated irregular routes and plundered the LGOC's passengers, eroded the profitability of the Combine's bus operations. This had a negative impact on the profitability of the whole group. Stanley <a href="lobbying">lobbied</a> the government for regulation of transport services in the London area. Starting in 1923, a series of legislative initiatives were made in this direction, with Stanley and <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> politician <a href="Herbert%20Morrison">Herbert Morrison</a>, <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a>lor (and later member of parliament and <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Transport%23Minister%20of%20Transport">Minister of Transport</a>) at the forefront of debates as to the level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought. Stanley aimed for regulation that would give the UERL group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of the <a href="London%20County%20Council%20Tramways">LCC's tram system</a>; Morrison preferred full public ownership. After seven years of false starts, a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Passenger Transport Board</a> (LPTB), a public corporation that would take control of the UERL, the Metropolitan Railway and all bus and tram operators within an area designated as the <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board%23London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Area">London Passenger Transport Area</a>. As Stanley had done with shareholders in 1910 over the consolidation of the three UERL controlled tube lines, he used his persuasiveness to obtain their agreements to the government buy-out of their stock.

The Board was a compromise – public ownership but not full <a href="nationalization">nationalisation</a> – and came into existence on 1 July 1933, with Stanley as chairman and Pick as Chief Executive.

Livyatan

Livyatan is an <a href="extinction">extinct</a> genus of <a href="Physeteroidea">sperm whale</a> containing one species: L. melvillei. Its name was inspired by the biblical sea monster <a href="Leviathan">Leviathan</a>, and the author of the book "<a href="Moby-Dick">Moby-Dick</a>", <a href="Herman%20Melville">Herman Melville</a>, where the <a href="Moby%20Dick%20%28whale%29">antagonist</a> is a large sperm whale. It was found in the <a href="Pisco%20Formation">Pisco Formation</a> of Peru and lived during the <a href="Tortonian">Tortonian</a> stage of the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> <a href="Epoch%20%28geology%29">epoch</a>, about 9.9–8.9 million <a href="year">year</a>s ago (mya); however, a large tooth from Australia implies that either it or a close relative survived into the <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>, around 5 mya. It was a member of a group of <a href="hypercarnivore">hyper-predatory</a> <a href="macroraptorial%20sperm%20whale">macroraptorial sperm whale</a>s (or "raptorial sperm whales") and was likely an <a href="apex%20predator">apex predator</a>, preying on whales, seals, and so forth. Characteristic of raptorial sperm whales, "Livyatan" had functional, <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a>-coated teeth on the upper and lower jaws, as well as several adaptations for hunting large prey.

Its total length has been estimated to be about , similar to the modern <a href="sperm%20whale">sperm whale</a> ("Physeter macrocephalus"), making it one of the largest predators to have ever existed. The tallest tooth measured , and is the largest tooth of any known animal, excluding tusks. It is distinguished from the other raptorial sperm whales by the basin on the skull, and how it spans the entire length of the <a href="rostrum%20%28anatomy%29">snout</a>. The <a href="spermaceti%20organ">spermaceti organ</a>, contained in that basin, is thought to have been used in <a href="Animal%20echolocation">echolocation</a> and communication, or for ramming prey and other sperm whales. The whale may have interacted with the large extinct shark <a href="megalodon">megalodon</a> ("Carcharocles megalodon"), <a href="interspecific%20competition">competing</a> with it for a similar food source. Its extinction was likely caused by a cooling event at the end of the Miocene which resulted in a drop in food populations. The formation where the whale has been found has also preserved a large assemblage of marine life, such as sharks and <a href="marine%20mammal">marine mammal</a>s.

In November 2008, a partially preserved skull, as well as teeth and the lower jaw, belonging to "L. melvillei", the <a href="holotype%20specimen">holotype specimen</a> MUSM 1676, were discovered in the coastal desert of Peru in the sediments of the <a href="Pisco%20Formation">Pisco Formation</a>, southwest of the city of <a href="Ica%2C%20Peru">Ica</a>. Klaas Post, a researcher for the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%20Rotterdam">Natural History Museum Rotterdam</a> in the Netherlands, stumbled across them on the final day of a field trip. The fossils were prepared in <a href="Lima">Lima</a>, and are now part of the collection of the <a href="Museum%20of%20Natural%20History%2C%20Lima">Museum of Natural History, Lima</a> of <a href="National%20University%20of%20San%20Marcos">National University of San Marcos</a>.

The discoverers originally assigned—in July 2010—the English name of the biblical monster, Leviathan, to the whale as "Leviathan melvillei". However, the scientific name "Leviathan" was also the <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a> for the <a href="mastodon">mastodon</a> ("Mammut"), so, in August 2010, the authors rectified this situation by coining a new genus name for the whale, "Livyatan", from the original <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> name of the monster. The <a href="species%20name">species name</a> "melvillei" is a reference to <a href="Herman%20Melville">Herman Melville</a>, author of the book "<a href="Moby-Dick">Moby-Dick</a>", which features a gigantic sperm whale as the main <a href="antagonist">antagonist</a>. The first "Livyatan" fossils from Peru were dated to around 13-12 million years ago (mya) in the <a href="Serravallian">Serravallian</a> Age of the Miocene, but this was revised to 9.9–8.9 mya in the <a href="Tortonian">Tortonian</a> Age of the Miocene.

In 2016 in <a href="Beaumaris%20Bay">Beaumaris Bay</a>, Australia, a large sperm whale tooth measuring , specimen NMV P16205, was discovered in Pliocene <a href="stratum">strata</a> by a local named Murray Orr, and was nicknamed the "Beaumaris sperm whale" or the "giant sperm whale". The tooth was donated to <a href="Museums%20Victoria">Museums Victoria</a> at <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. Though it has not been given a species designation, the tooth looks similar to those of "Livyatan", indicating that it was a close relative. The tooth is dated to around 5 mya, and so is younger than the Peruvian "L. melvillei" specimen by around 4 or 5 million years.

"Livyatan" was part of a fossil <a href="Crown%20group">stem group</a> of <a href="hypercarnivore">hyper-predatory</a> <a href="Physeteroidea">sperm whales</a> commonly known as <a href="macroraptorial%20sperm%20whale">macroraptorial sperm whale</a>s, or raptorial sperm whales, alongside the extinct whales "<a href="Brygmophyseter">Brygmophyseter</a>", "<a href="Acrophyseter">Acrophyseter</a>", and "<a href="Zygophyseter">Zygophyseter</a>". This group is known for having large, functional teeth on both the upper and lower jaws, which were used in capturing large prey, and had an <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a> coating. Conversely, the modern <a href="sperm%20whale">sperm whale</a> ("Physeter macrocephalus") lacks enamel, teeth in the upper jaw, and the ability to use its teeth to catch prey. "Livyatan" belongs to a different lineage to the other raptorial sperm whales, and the size increase and the development of the <a href="spermaceti%20organ">spermaceti organ</a>, an organ that is characteristic of sperm whales, are thought to have evolved independently from other raptorial sperm whales. The large teeth of the raptorial sperm whales either evolved once in the group with a <a href="Basilosauridae">basilosaurid-like</a> common ancestor, or independently in "Livyatan". The large <a href="temporal%20fossa">temporal fossa</a> in the skull of raptorial sperm whales is thought to a <a href="symplesiomorphy">plesiomorphic</a> feature, that is, a trait inherited from a common ancestor. Since the teeth of <a href="fetal">fetal</a> modern sperm whales ("Physeter macrocephalus") have enamel on them before being coated with <a href="cementum">cementum</a>, it is thought that the enamel is also an ancient characteristic (<a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a>). The appearance of raptorial sperm whales in the fossil record coincides with the diversification of <a href="baleen%20whale">baleen whale</a>s in the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>, implying that they evolved specifically to exploit baleen whales. It has also been suggested that the raptorial sperm whales should be placed into the <a href="subfamily">subfamily</a> <a href="Hoplocetinae">Hoplocetinae</a>, alongside the genera "<a href="Diaphorocetus">Diaphorocetus</a>", "<a href="Idiorophus">Idiorophus</a>", "<a href="Scaldicetus">Scaldicetus</a>", and "<a href="Hoplocetus">Hoplocetus</a>", which are known from the Miocene to the lower <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>. However, most of these taxa remain too fragmentary or have been used as <a href="Wastebasket%20taxon">wastebasket taxa</a> for non-diagnostic material of stem physeteroids. This subfamily is characterized by their robust and enamel-coated teeth.

Since only the skull of "Livyatan" is known, the ratio of the skull compared to the rest of the body length is unknown, and so its total body length is unclear. The total length of adult "Livyatan" is estimated to have been about when using the modern sperm whale for scaling, and when using the raptorial "Zygophyseter" for scaling; scaling achieved by measuring the head-to-body ratios. In comparison, the modern sperm whale measures on average . It has been estimated to weigh based on the length estimate of . The large size was probably an <a href="anti-predator%20adaptation">anti-predator adaptation</a>, and allowed it to feed on larger prey. "Livyatan" is the largest fossil sperm whale discovered, and was also one of the biggest-known predators, having the largest bite of any <a href="tetrapod">tetrapod</a>.
The holotype skull of "Livyatan" was about long. Like other raptorial sperm whales, "Livyatan" had a wide gap in between the <a href="temporal%20fossa">temporal fossa</a>e on the sides of the skull and the <a href="zygomatic%20process">zygomatic process</a>es on the front of the skull, indicating a large space for holding strong <a href="temporal%20muscle">temporal muscle</a>s, which are the most powerful muscles between the skull and the jaw. The <a href="rostrum%20%28anatomy%29">snout</a> was robust, thick, and relatively short, which allowed it to clamp down harder and better handle struggling prey. The left and right <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a>e on the snout probably did not intersect at the tip of the snout, though the premaxillae took up most of the front end of the snout. Unlike in the modern sperm whale, the premaxillae reached the sides of the snout. The upper jaw was thick, especially midway through the snout. The snout was asymmetrical, with the right <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> in the upper jaw becoming slightly convex towards the back of the snout, and the left maxilla becoming slightly concave towards the back of the snout. The <a href="vomer">vomer</a> reached the tip of the snout, and was slightly concave, decreasing in thickness from the back to the front. A sudden thickening in the middle-left side of the vomer may indicate the location of the <a href="nasalis%20muscle">nose plug muscles</a>. Each <a href="mandible">mandible</a> in the lower jaw was higher than it was wide, with a larger gap in between the two than in the modern sperm whale. The <a href="mandibular%20symphysis">mandibular symphysis</a> which connects the two halves of the mandibles in the middle of the lower jaw was unfused. The <a href="condyloid%20process">condyloid process</a>, which connects the lower jaw to the skull, was located near the bottom of the mandible like other sperm whales.

Unlike the modern sperm whale, "Livyatan" had functional teeth in both jaws. The wearing on the teeth indicates that the teeth sheared past each other while biting down, meaning it could bite off large portions of flesh from its prey. Also, the teeth were deeply embedded into the gums and could interlock, which were adaptations to holding struggling prey. None of the teeth of the holotype were complete, and none of the back teeth were well-preserved. The lower jaw contained 22 teeth, and the upper jaw contained 18 teeth. Unlike other sperm whales with functional teeth in the upper jaw, none of the <a href="dental%20alveolus">tooth roots</a> were entirely present in the <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a> portion of the snout, being at least partially in the maxilla. Consequently, its tooth count was lower than those sperm whales, and, aside from the modern <a href="dwarf%20sperm%20whale">dwarf</a> ("Kogia sima") and <a href="pygmy%20sperm%20whale">pygmy</a> ("K. breviceps") sperm whales, it had the lowest tooth count in the lower jaw of any sperm whale.

The most robust teeth in "Livyatan" were the fourth, fifth, and sixth teeth in each side of the jaw. The well-preserved teeth all had a height greater than , and the largest teeth of the holotype were the second and third on the left lower jaw, which were calculated to be around high. The first right tooth was the smallest at around . The Beaumaris sperm whale tooth measured around in length, and is the largest fossil tooth discovered in Australia. These teeth are thought to be among the largest of any known animal, excluding <a href="tusk">tusk</a>s. Some of the lower teeth have been shown to contain a facet for when the jaws close, which may have been used to properly fit the largest teeth inside the jaw. In the front teeth, the tooth diameter decreased towards the base. This was the opposite for the back teeth, and the biggest diameters for these teeth were around in the lower jaw. All teeth featured a rapid shortening of the diameter towards the tip of the tooth, which were probably in part due to wearing throughout their lifetimes. The curvature of the teeth decreased from front to back, and the lower teeth were more curved at the tips than the upper teeth. The front teeth projected forward at a 45-degree angle, and, like in other sperm whales, cementum was probably continually added onto the teeth throughout its lifetime.
All tooth sockets were cylindrical and single-rooted. The tooth sockets increased in size from the first to the fourth and then decreased, the fourth being the largest at around in diameter in the upper jaws, which is the largest of any known whale species. The tooth sockets were smaller in the lower jaw than they were in the upper jaw, and they were circular in shape, except for the front sockets which were more ovular.

The fossil skull of "Livyatan" had a curved basin, known as the supracranial basin, which was deep and wide. Unlike other raptorial sperm whales, but much like in the modern sperm whale, the basin spanned the entire length of the snout, causing the entire skull to be concave on the top rather than creating a snout as seen in "<a href="Zygophyseter">Zygophyseter</a>" and "<a href="Acrophyseter">Acrophyseter</a>". The supracranial basin was the deepest and widest over the <a href="Neurocranium">braincase</a>, and, unlike other raptorial sperm whales, it did not overhang the <a href="orbit%20%28anatomy%29">eye socket</a>. It was defined by high walls on the sides. The antorbital notches, which are usually slit-like notches on the sides of the skull right before the snout, were inside the basin. A slanting crest on the temporal fossa directed towards the back of the skull separated the snout from the rest of the skull, and was defined by a groove starting at the antorbital processes on the cheekbones. The basin had two <a href="Foramen%23Skull">foramina</a> in the front, as opposed to the modern sperm whale which has one <a href="infraorbital%20foramen">foramen on the maxilla</a>, and to the modern dwarf and pygmy sperm whales which have several in the basin. The <a href="suture%20%28anatomy%29">suture</a> in the basin between the maxilla and the <a href="frontal%20bone">forehead</a> had an interlocking pattern.

"Livyatan" was an <a href="apex%20predator">apex predator</a>, and probably had a profound impact on the structuring of Miocene marine communities. Using its large and deeply rooted teeth, it is likely to have hunted large prey near the surface, its diet probably consisting mainly of medium-sized baleen whales ranging from in length. It probably also preyed upon sharks, seals, dolphins, and other large marine vertebrates, occupying a <a href="ecological%20niche">niche</a> similar to the modern <a href="killer%20whale">killer whale</a> ("Orcinus orca"). It was contemporaneous with and occupied the same region as the <a href="megalodon">megalodon</a> shark, which was likely also an apex predator, implying <a href="interspecific%20competition">competition</a> over their similar food source. It is assumed that the hunting tactics of "Livyatan" for hunting whales were similar to that of the modern killer whale, pursuing prey to wear it out, and then drowning it. Modern killer whales work in groups to isolate and kill whales, but, given its size, "Livyatan" may have been able to hunt alone.

The supracranial basin in its head suggests that "Livyatan" had a large <a href="spermaceti%20organ">spermaceti organ</a>, a series of <a href="sperm%20oil">oil</a> and <a href="spermaceti">wax</a> reservoirs separated by <a href="connective%20tissue">connective tissue</a>. The uses for the spermaceti organ in "Livyatan" are unknown. Much like in the modern sperm whale, it could have been used in the process of <a href="Animal%20echolocation">biosonar</a> to generate sound for locating prey. It is possible that it was also used as a means of <a href="whale%20vocalization">acoustic displays</a>, such as for communication purposes between individuals. It may have been used for acoustic stunning, which would have caused the bodily functions of a target animal to shut down from exposure to the intense sounds.

Another theory says that the enlarged forehead caused by the presence of the spermaceti organ is used in all sperm whales between males fighting for females during mating season by head-butting each other, including "Livyatan" and the modern sperm whale. It may have also been used to ram into prey; if this is the case, in support of this, there have been two reports of modern sperm whales attacking <a href="sperm%20whaling">whaling vessels</a> by ramming into them, and the organ is disproportionally larger in male modern sperm whales.

An alternate theory is that sperm whales, including "Livyatan", can alter the temperature of the wax in the organ to aid in buoyancy. Lowering the temperature increases the density to have it act as a weight for deep-sea diving, and raising the temperature decreases the density to have it pull the whale to the surface.

"Livyatan" is known from the <a href="Tortonian">Tortonian</a> stage of the Upper <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> 9.9–8.9 mya in the Pisco Formation of Peru, which is known for its well-preserved assemblage of marine vertebrates. Among the baleen whales found, the most common was an undescribed species of <a href="Cetotheriidae">cetotheriid</a> whale measuring around , and most of the other baleen whales found were roughly the same size. Toothed whale remains found consist of beaked whales (such as "<a href="Messapicetus">Messapicetus</a> gregarius"), ancient <a href="La%20Plata%20dolphin">pontoporiids</a> (such as "<a href="Brachydelphis">Brachydelphis</a> mazeasi"), <a href="oceanic%20dolphin">oceanic dolphin</a>s, and the raptorial sperm whale "Acrophyseter". All seal remains found represent the <a href="Phocidae">earless seals</a>. Also found were large sea turtles such as "<a href="Pacifichelys">Pacifichelys</a> urbinai", which points to the development of <a href="seagrass">seagrass</a>es in this area. Partial bones of crocodiles were discovered. Of the seabirds, fragmentary bones of <a href="cormorant">cormorant</a>s and <a href="Procellariidae">petrels</a> were discovered, as well as two species of <a href="Booby">boobies</a>. The remains of many <a href="Chondrichthyes">cartilaginous fish</a> were discovered in this formation, including more than 3,500 shark teeth, which mainly belonged to the <a href="Carcharhiniformes">ground sharks</a>, such as <a href="requiem%20shark">requiem shark</a>s and <a href="hammerhead%20shark">hammerhead shark</a>s. To a lesser extent, <a href="Lamniformes">mackerel sharks</a> were also found, such as <a href="lamnidae">white sharks</a>, <a href="sand%20shark">sand shark</a>s, and <a href="Otodontidae">Otodontidae</a>. Many shark teeth were associated with the extinct <a href="Cosmopolitodus%20hastalis">broad-tooth mako</a> ("Cosmopolitodus/Carcharodon hastalis") and megalodon, and the teeth of these two sharks were found near whale and seal remains. <a href="Eagle%20ray">Eagle ray</a>s, <a href="sawfish">sawfish</a>, and <a href="angelshark">angelshark</a>s were other cartilaginous fish found. Most of the <a href="Osteichthyes">bony fish</a> findings belonged to <a href="tuna">tuna</a>s and <a href="Sciaenidae">croakers</a>. "Livyatan" and megalodon were likely the apex predators of this area during this time.

The Beaumaris sperm whale was found in the <a href="Beaumaris%20Bay">Beaumaris Bay</a> <a href="Black%20Rock%20Sandstone%20Formation">Black Rock Sandstone Formation</a> in Australia near the city of <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, dating to 5 mya in the Pliocene. Beaumaris Bay is one of the most productive marine fossil sites in Australia for marine megafauna. Shark teeth belonging to twenty different species have been discovered there, such as from the <a href="whale%20shark">whale shark</a> ("Rhincodon typus"), the <a href="Port%20Jackson%20shark">Port Jackson shark</a> ("Heterodontus portusjacksoni"), the broad-toothed mako, and Megalodon. Some examples of whales found include the ancient humpback whale "<a href="Megaptera%20miocaena">Megaptera miocaena</a>", the <a href="dolphin">dolphin</a> "<a href="Steno%20cudmorei">Steno cudmorei</a>", and the sperm whale "<a href="Physetodon%20baileyi">Physetodon baileyi</a>". Other large marine animals found include ancient <a href="elephant%20seal">elephant seal</a>s, <a href="dugong">dugong</a>s, sea turtles, ancient penguins such as "<a href="Pseudaptenodytes">Pseudaptenodytes</a>", the extinct albatross "<a href="Great%20albatross">Diomedea thyridata</a>", and the extinct <a href="Pelagornithidae">toothed seabirds</a> of the genus "<a href="Pelagornis">Pelagornis</a>".

A cooling event at the end of the Miocene, which caused baleen whales to increase in size and decrease in diversity, may have been the cause of the extinction, with "Livyatan" becoming <a href="coextinction">coextinct</a> with the small baleen whales it fed on.

Pedro Afonso, Prince Imperial of Brazil

<a href="Dom%20%28title%29">Dom</a> Pedro Afonso (19 July 1848 – 10 January 1850) was the Prince Imperial and <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a> to the throne of the <a href="Empire%20of%20Brazil">Empire of Brazil</a>. Born at the <a href="Pa%C3%A7o%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Crist%C3%B3v%C3%A3o">Palace of São Cristóvão</a> in Rio de Janeiro, he was the second son and youngest child of Emperor Dom <a href="Pedro%20II%20of%20Brazil">Pedro II</a> and Dona <a href="Teresa%20Cristina%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies">Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies</a>, and thus a member of the Brazilian branch of the <a href="House%20of%20Braganza">House of Braganza</a>. Pedro Afonso was seen as vital to the future viability of the monarchy, which had been put in jeopardy by the death of his older brother Dom <a href="Afonso%2C%20Prince%20Imperial%20of%20Brazil">Afonso</a> almost three years earlier.

Pedro Afonso's death from fever at the age of one devastated the Emperor, and the imperial couple had no further children. Pedro Afonso's older sister Dona <a href="Isabel%2C%20Princess%20Imperial%20of%20Brazil">Isabel</a> became heiress, but Pedro II was unconvinced that a woman could ever be accepted as monarch by the ruling elite. He excluded Isabel from matters of state and failed to provide training for her possible role as empress. With no surviving male children, the Emperor started to believe that the imperial line was destined to end with his own death.

Pedro Afonso was born at 08:00 on 19 July 1848 in the <a href="Pa%C3%A7o%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Crist%C3%B3v%C3%A3o">Palace of São Cristóvão</a> in Rio de Janeiro, <a href="Empire%20of%20Brazil">Brazil</a>. His full name was Pedro Afonso Cristiano Leopoldo Eugênio Fernando Vicente Miguel Gabriel Rafael Gonzaga. Through his father, Emperor Pedro II, he was a member of the Brazilian branch of the <a href="House%20of%20Braganza">House of Braganza</a> and was referred to using the honorific <a href="Dom%20%28title%29">Dom</a> (Lord) from birth. He was the grandson of Emperor Dom <a href="Pedro%20I%20of%20Brazil">Pedro I</a> and the nephew of the reigning Queen of Portugal, Dona <a href="Maria%20II%20of%20Portugal">Maria II</a>. Through his mother, Teresa Cristina, he was a grandson of Don Francesco I (<a href="Francis%20I%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies">Francis I</a>) and nephew to Don Ferdinando II (<a href="Ferdinand%20II%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies">Ferdinand II</a>), who ruled as <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies">kings of the Two Sicilies</a> in turn.

Following the birth, Pedro II received official congratulations at a formal reception held later that day, which according to a contemporary was an event "more splendid and better attended" than any since the Emperor was declared of age in 1840. News of the birth of a male heir was received with rejoicing among the Brazilian people. Celebrations included skyrockets and artillery salutes. City streets were illuminated for days after the birth, and an elaborate gala was held at court. The birth of Pedro Afonso was widely welcomed, as a male heir was regarded as imperative for the Empire's continuation, even though the constitution allowed for female succession. Writer <a href="Manuel%20de%20Ara%C3%BAjo%20Porto%20Alegre%2C%20Baron%20of%20Santo%20%C3%82ngelo">Manuel de Araújo Porto Alegre</a> (later Baron of Santo Ângelo) considered the birth of Pedro Afonso a "triumph" that had secured the succession.

Pedro Afonso's baptism took place on 4 October 1848. The ceremony was held privately in the <a href="Old%20Cathedral%20of%20Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Imperial Chapel</a>, followed by public celebrations. The godparents were his granduncle Emperor <a href="Ferdinand%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI%20of%20Austria">Ferdinand I of Austria</a> and his step-grandmother <a href="Am%C3%A9lie%20of%20Leuchtenberg">Amélie of Leuchtenberg</a>. Prime Minister and former regent <a href="Pedro%20de%20Ara%C3%BAjo%20Lima%2C%20Marquis%20of%20Olinda">Pedro de Araújo Lima</a> (then-Viscount and later Marquis of Olinda) and Mariana de Verna, Countess of Belmont represented the godparents, who were not present. Fireworks entertained the crowds, and a <a href="Shell%20%28theater%29">band shell</a> that could hold more than a hundred musicians was raised for the festivities that followed. According to historian Hendrik Kraay, royal baptisms in imperial Brazil "stressed that the princes and princesses secured the dynasty's future". As the sole surviving male child, Pedro Afonso took precedence in the line of succession over his two older sisters, Dona <a href="Isabel%2C%20Princess%20Imperial%20of%20Brazil">Isabel</a> and Dona <a href="Princess%20Leopoldina%20of%20Brazil">Leopoldina</a>. Pedro Afonso, as <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a> to the Brazilian throne, was styled "Prince Imperial" from birth.

In 1847 and the two following years, Pedro II and his family spent the summer at <a href="Petr%C3%B3polis">Petrópolis</a>. The traditional summer residence of the imperial family was at <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20Estate">Santa Cruz Estate</a>, a rural property that had belonged to the Braganzas for generations. The shift to Petrópolis seemed an unwelcome novelty among members of the court, "who disliked any change that threatened the established ways and interests". Bowing to tradition, the Emperor decided to again summer at Santa Cruz in 1850. During the imperial family's stay at the rural estate, Pedro Afonso and his sister Isabel were struck by fever. The princess eventually recovered, but the Prince Imperial died of convulsions at 04:20 on 10 January. Contemporaries argued that either <a href="encephalitis">encephalitis</a> or a <a href="congenital%20disorder">congenital disorder</a> may have caused his death.

Pedro II regarded the death of his son as "the most fatal blow that I could ever receive, and certainly I would not have survived were it not that I still have a wife and two children". The Emperor wrote to his brother-in-law Dom <a href="Fernando%20II%20of%20Portugal">Fernando II</a>, King-consort of Portugal: "By the time you receive this, you will certainly have learnt of the grievous loss I have undergone ... God who has made me pass through so hard a testing, will in his mercy give me grounds to console my sorrows." Pedro II had already lost another son, Dom <a href="Afonso%2C%20Prince%20Imperial%20of%20Brazil">Afonso</a>, almost three years earlier. He revealed his inner turmoil in a sonnet: "Twice already I have suffered death, for the father dies who sees his son is dead." Except for brief inspection visits, the Emperor avoided Santa Cruz thereafter.

A grand funeral was held for the Prince Imperial two days after his death. The streets were crowded with ordinary people who greatly mourned the prince's death. So remarkable was the event that tourists paid for the privilege of watching the funeral procession from a hotel in downtown Rio de Janeiro. Pedro Afonso was buried in the mausoleum of the "Convento de Santo Antônio" (Convent of Saint Anthony) in Rio de Janeiro.

<a href="Hon%C3%B3rio%20Hermeto%20Carneiro%20Le%C3%A3o%2C%20Marquis%20of%20Paran%C3%A1">Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão</a> (later Marquis of Paraná), one of Brazil's leading politicians and then serving as president (governor) of the province of <a href="Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a>, summarized the prevalent view among Brazil's ruling elite regarding the succession of the Empire when he addressed the Provincial Assembly: "It is my painful duty to inform you of the death of the Prince Imperial D. Pedro Afonso, which occurred on 10 January of the current year. It is the second time we lose the heir presumptive of the crown." Honório Hermeto continued: "It must serve as a consolation to us, the certainty of [good] health of H[is]. M[ajesty]. the Emperor and his august wife. Both in the prime of their years, and full of life, still promise both numerous fruits from their conjugal bed as well as a male succession to the crown, as required for both the consolidation of our still recent institutions and the restless spirit of the century."

What no one could foresee was that Pedro II and Teresa Cristina would have no more children. The reason is unknown, although scholars think it is probably because they no longer had sexual intercourse. The Emperor was devastated by the death of Pedro Afonso and was never able to cope with it entirely. According to historian Roderick J. Barman, Pedro II was "deeply affected, emotionally and intellectually". The Emperor wrote a sonnet that expressed his feelings:
In the Emperor's eyes, the deaths of his sons seemed to presage the end of the imperial system. His younger son had represented his future and that of the monarchy. Although the Emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil in the male-dominated social climate of the time. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class. The lack of a male heir caused him to lose motivation in promoting the imperial office as a position to be carried on by his descendants; he increasingly saw the imperial system as so inextricably linked to himself that it could not survive him.

The prince's full style and title was "His Imperial Highness Dom Pedro, Prince Imperial of Brazil".

The Prince Imperial was a recipient of the following Brazilian Orders:

Somerset County Cricket Club in 2009

<a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset County Cricket Club</a> competed in four domestic competitions during the <a href="2009%20English%20cricket%20season">2009 English cricket season</a>: the first division of the <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a>, the <a href="Friends%20Provident%20Trophy">Friends Provident Trophy</a>, the first division of the <a href="Pro40">NatWest Pro40</a> League and the <a href="Twenty20%20Cup">Twenty20 Cup</a>. Through their performance in the Twenty20 Cup, the team qualified for the <a href="Champions%20League%20Twenty20">Champions League Twenty20</a>. They enjoyed a successful season, but fell short of winning any competitions, prompting Director of Cricket <a href="Brian%20Rose%20%28cricketer%29">Brian Rose</a> to say "We've had enough of being cricket's nearly men."

Consistent performances in the County Championship helped Somerset remain challengers for the competition until the last few weeks of the season, but the batting-friendly <a href="Cricket%20pitch">pitch</a> at their home ground, the <a href="County%20Ground%2C%20Taunton">County Ground, Taunton</a>, meant that the county finished with too many draws to claim their first Championship title. Consistency was also key for Somerset's success in one-day cricket, where they remained unbeaten in the group stage of the Friends Provident Trophy, but were eliminated in the first knock-out round, and finished runners-up by one point in the NatWest Pro40. In the Twenty20 Cup, Somerset finished as losing finalists. This meant that they qualified for the Champions League Twenty20, where they progressed into the second group stage of the competition. They failed to win any matches in that phase of the competition, resulting in their elimination.

Somerset were captained for the third successive season by their Australian overseas player, <a href="Justin%20Langer">Justin Langer</a>, who announced during the season that it would be his last with Somerset. <a href="Marcus%20Trescothick">Marcus Trescothick</a> topped the national batting tables, scoring almost 3,000 runs in all competitions in 2009; as a result, he was named as both <a href="PCA%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) Player of the Year</a> and the PCA's Most Valuable Player of the Year.

After promotion from the second division of the <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a> in 2007, Somerset were among the first division title contenders in the <a href="2008%20County%20Championship">2008</a>. A loss to <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a> in the final match of the season meant they finished in fourth place. <a href="David%20Foot%20%28journalist%29">David Foot</a>, writing in "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden</a>", claimed that too many of the Somerset batsmen had "lost their way" in one-day cricket, as they narrowly avoided relegation in the <a href="2008%20NatWest%20Pro40">NatWest Pro40</a>, and were eliminated in the <a href="2008%20Friends%20Provident%20Trophy">Friends Provident Trophy</a>.

Somerset promoted four players from their academy for the 2009 season, giving contracts to <a href="Jos%20Buttler">Jos Buttler</a>, <a href="Adam%20Dibble">Adam Dibble</a>, <a href="Chris%20Jones%20%28cricketer%29">Chris Jones</a> and James Burke. Of these, only Buttler appeared in the first-team during the season. They also signed <a href="David%20Stiff">David Stiff</a>, a <a href="Fast%20bowling">fast bowler</a> capped at Under-19 level for England, on a two-month contract at the beginning of the season, which was later extended to the end of the season. <a href="Ian%20Blackwell">Ian Blackwell</a>, captain of the side in 2005 and 2006, left for <a href="Durham%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Durham</a> after coach <a href="Andrew%20Hurry">Andy Hurry</a> and captain <a href="Justin%20Langer">Justin Langer</a> made it clear that they regarded fitness as a priority. <a href="John%20Francis%20%28cricketer%29">John Francis</a> and <a href="Keith%20Parsons">Keith Parsons</a> both retired at the end of 2008, Francis cited lack of first-team opportunities for his departure, while at the age of 35, Parsons declared that: "There comes a time when your body tells you it's time to pack in professional sport."

In his preview of the 2009 season for <a href="ESPNcricinfo">ESPNcricinfo</a>, <a href="Andrew%20McGlashan">Andrew McGlashan</a> identified Somerset's opening partnerships with bat and ball as their main strengths, but predicted that the <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Middle%20order">middle order</a> would struggle to make an impact in the County Championship, stating that "none [of the middle order] jump out as potential match-winners in four-day cricket." He speculated that the team's best chance of success would come in the one-day competitions. "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" provided a more positive outlook, claiming that the county had "enough depth in batting and seam bowling to challenge [for the County Championship] again." They identified <a href="spin%20bowling">spin bowling</a> as an area of weakness following the departure of Blackwell. <a href="Bob%20Willis">Bob Willis</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", shared this view, and predicted that Somerset would also be hindered by the difficulty of getting 20 wickets at <a href="County%20Ground%2C%20Taunton">home</a>, resulting in too many draws.

The following players made at least one appearance for Somerset in <a href="First-class%20cricket">first-class</a>, <a href="List%20A%20cricket">List A</a> or <a href="Twenty20">Twenty20</a> cricket in 2009. Age given is at the start of Somerset's first match of the season (15 April 2009).

Although <a href="Marcus%20Trescothick">Marcus Trescothick</a> had a season which <a href="David%20Foot%20%28journalist%29">David Foot</a> described as "imperiously assured", Somerset failed to win enough matches to pose a real challenge in the <a href="2009%20County%20Championship">2009 County Championship</a>. The <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23F">flat pitch</a> at the <a href="County%20Ground%2C%20Taunton">County Ground, Taunton</a> did not help their efforts; the imbalance in favour of the batsmen meant that all but one match at the ground was drawn. <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a>s total of 742/5 <a href="Declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declared</a> was the fifteenth highest total in the history of the County Championship, while <a href="Murray%20Goodwin">Murray Goodwin</a>s <a href="Innings%23Cricket">innings</a> of 344 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> in that match was the sixth highest score by a batsman in the history of the competition. In total, six of Somerset's eight home matches contained scores of 500 or over in a single innings. In contrast, 500 was reached in only one of their away matches, by <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a> at <a href="The%20Rose%20Bowl%20%28cricket%20ground%29">The Rose Bowl</a>. The home conditions helped three of Somerset's batsmen pass 1,000 first-class runs in the season, including <a href="Craig%20Kieswetter">Craig Kieswetter</a> and <a href="Arul%20Suppiah">Arul Suppiah</a>, who were both awarded their <a href="Cricket%20cap">county caps</a> after passing the landmark. Trescothick's 1,817 runs were the most by any batsman in the 2009 competition, finishing over 200 runs ahead of the next most prolific batsman, and he was named as both <a href="PCA%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">PCA Player of the Year</a> and the PCA's Most Valuable Player of the Year for 2009. He was also selected as part of the team of the year, along with <a href="wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper</a> Kieswetter.

In contrast to the strong batting line-up, Foot suggested that Somerset "lacked a <a href="Seam%20bowling">seam bowler</a> to compensate for <a href="Andrew%20Caddick">Andrew Caddick</a>s withdrawal". Caddick—who made his first-class debut for Somerset in 1991—only played five matches in 2009, and announced his intention to retire at the end of the season. He took ten wickets in 2009, and finished his career as Somerset's sixth highest wicket-taker of all-time. This placed the majority of the wicket-taking burden upon <a href="Charl%20Willoughby">Charl Willoughby</a>, the South African <a href="Fast%20bowling">fast-medium</a> pace bowler. He responded well, and took 54 wickets in the County Championship, more than any other bowler in the first division. He was aided by seam bowlers <a href="David%20Stiff">David Stiff</a>, who returned to the first-class game for the first time since 2006, and <a href="Alfonso%20Thomas">Alfonso Thomas</a>. Stiff took 31 wickets, more than quadrupling his career first-class wicket total, and Thomas took 35, his highest return in an English domestic season. Somerset lacked an effective <a href="Spin%20bowling">spin bowler</a> in 2009 following the departure of <a href="Ian%20Blackwell">Ian Blackwell</a> the previous season, and the spinners combined only claimed 31 wickets, bowling less balls between them than Willoughby alone.

Somerset began their season by playing out a high-scoring draw at home against <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a>, in which both teams reached 500 in their first innings. <a href="James%20Hildreth">James Hildreth</a> scored a triple-century, reaching the milestone earlier in an English season than any player previously, and became the first English player to pass 300 runs in an innings for Somerset since <a href="Harold%20Gimblett">Harold Gimblett</a> in 1948. In contrast, Somerset had to battle back for a draw in their second match. After <a href="Durham%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Durham</a> scored 543 in their first innings, Somerset <a href="wiktionary%3Acollapse">collapsed</a> to 69 <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23A">all out</a> in reply; only Langer passed 20 runs, while six of his batting colleagues made <a href="Duck%20%28cricket%29">ducks</a>. After being forced to <a href="follow-on">follow-on</a>, Trescothick, Langer and Kieswetter all scored centuries to secure a draw. Somerset's third match resulted in their only loss of the County Championship season, coming against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a> at <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a>; and at the end of May, they were second bottom in the first division. Their next match finished in a draw against <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a>, a result which was always likely after the first day was lost to rain. Somerset next picked up victories against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> and Sussex before scoring the second-highest ever fourth innings winning total in the County Championship to beat Yorkshire at Taunton. These three wins propelled Somerset to third in the competition at the start of July, and they did not drop below this position for the remainder of the season.

In each of their following two matches, at home against <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a> and away to <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a>, Somerset batted first and then enforced the follow-on after bowling their opponents out cheaply. In each their opponents managed to avoid defeat, and both matches resulted in draws. During the Worcestershire match, Langer's first innings 107 took him past Sir <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>'s total of 28,067 first-class runs to become the highest-scoring Australian batsman. Successive draws against Nottinghamshire, Warwickshire, Sussex and Hampshire meant that Somerset travelled to Durham requiring a victory to maintain any realistic hopes of claiming the County Championship title. No play was possible on the third and fourth days, and the match resulted in another draw, leaving Somerset with only a slim mathematical chance of the title. Another draw, against Lancashire, while Durham beat Nottinghamshire, meant that Durham clinched the title. Somerset drew with Worcestershire (their ninth draw in a row in the competition), and finished third in the first division.

In the <a href="2009%20Friends%20Provident%20Trophy">2009 Friends Provident Trophy</a>, the first one-day competition in the English domestic calendar, Somerset showed a marked improvement from the previous season. They were described by <a href="Steve%20James%20%28cricketer%29">Steve James</a>, writing in "Wisden", as "the most impressive qualifiers" from the group stage, and both Trescothick and Kieswetter were praised for their batting form. They were the only side in the competition to remain unbeaten in the group stages, finishing with seven victories and one no result. In the quarter-final, against Group C runners-up <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a>, Somerset won the toss and opted to bat at Taunton. They struggled initially, losing the early wickets of Trescothick, <a href="James%20Hildreth">James Hildreth</a> and <a href="Ben%20Phillips%20%28cricketer%29">Ben Phillips</a> for just 39 runs. A fourth-wicket partnership of 167, dominated by powerful hitting from Kieswetter in which he scored a "superb century" according to <a href="ESPNcricinfo">ESPNcricinfo</a>'s Andrew McGlashan, helped Somerset to recover to make 285/8, but Sussex chased the total down in the final over to eliminate the home side.

During the group stages of their campaign, Somerset achieved a number of large victories. They won by eight wickets against <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a> and <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a>, and by more than a hundred runs against <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a> and <a href="Scotland%20national%20cricket%20team">Scotland</a>. Their match against Middlesex at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a> was marred by some controversy, after Somerset were allowed too many <a href="Powerplay%20%28cricket%29">powerplay</a> overs in the rain-affected fixture. 
Somerset were set a <a href="Duckworth%E2%80%93Lewis%20method">reduced target</a> of 290 off 41 overs, of which 19 were allocated by the umpires as being powerplay overs, three more than there should have been. The <a href="England%20and%20Wales%20Cricket%20Board">England and Wales Cricket Board</a> (ECB) rejected Middlesex's request to replay the match, stating that they were upholding "the precedent that umpire errors cannot form the basis to declare a match null and void".

The two matches played against Middlesex were in stark contrast; in the match played at the <a href="Recreation%20Ground%2C%20Bath">Recreation Ground, Bath</a>, Somerset bowled the London side out for 65, the joint second-lowest total made against Somerset in a <a href="List%20A%20cricket">List A</a> match, while the 341/7 which Middlesex made at Lord's was the fourth-highest total scored against Somerset in the format. Somerset themselves scored their second-highest List A total, amassing 403/3 against Scotland, a game in which Hildreth scored 151, his highest List A score, and Somerset's highest score by a batsman at <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">number three</a> in List A cricket.

<a href="Zander%20de%20Bruyn">Zander de Bruyn</a> finished the competition with the highest batting average amongst batsmen who played five or more innings. Four Somerset batsmen scored over 300 runs in the tournament (Trescothick, 476; Kieswetter, 395; de Bruyn, 388; Hildreth, 313), more than any other county except eventual winners <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a>. Amongst the bowlers, <a href="Alfonso%20Thomas">Alfonso Thomas</a> finished as the tournament's joint leading wicket-taker, claiming 20 wickets to finish level with <a href="Chris%20Schofield">Chris Schofield</a> and <a href="Dominic%20Cork">Dominic Cork</a>. <a href="Peter%20Trego">Peter Trego</a>s 18 wickets were the next most in the competition.

Somerset finished as runners-up to Sussex in the <a href="2009%20Twenty20%20Cup">2009 Twenty20 Cup</a>, having reached <a href="Twenty20%20Cup%23Rules">Finals Day</a> in what captain <a href="Justin%20Langer">Justin Langer</a> described as "bizarre" fashion. Somerset qualified for the knock-out stages of the competition as the best third-placed team during the group stage, then beat <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a> in a <a href="bowl-out">bowl-out</a> to qualify for the semi-finals. After overcoming <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a> in the semi-final, Somerset were comprehensively beaten by Sussex in the final.

After the <a href="Indian%20Premier%20League">Indian Premier League</a>'s second season demonstrated the importance of <a href="spin%20bowling">spin bowling</a> in <a href="Twenty20">Twenty20</a> cricket, and due to Somerset's lack of a front-line spin bowler, Somerset picked young <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a>ner <a href="Max%20Waller">Max Waller</a> to make his Twenty20 debut in their opening match of the campaign. He claimed three wickets in two overs to help Somerset win by one run, and finished the competition as Somerset's joint second-highest wicket-taker with 10 wickets. Despite a number of good performances by Somerset's bowlers, a batsman was named <a href="Man%20of%20the%20match%23Cricket">man of the match</a> in each of the team's victories: <a href="James%20Hildreth">James Hildreth</a>, <a href="Craig%20Kieswetter">Craig Kieswetter</a> and <a href="Marcus%20Trescothick">Marcus Trescothick</a> were all awarded the accolade once, while <a href="Zander%20de%20Bruyn">Zander de Bruyn</a> picked up the award on three occasions. Somerset completed the group stage with six wins, three losses and one no result, placing them third in the <a href="2009%20Twenty20%20Cup%20Midlands/Wales/West%20Division">Midlands/Wales/West Division</a>. They qualified for the knockout-stage as they were the best third-placed team in the three groups.

Somerset's quarter-final, against Lancashire, was scheduled for Tuesday 28 July 2009. Bad weather meant that no play was possible on either the Tuesday or Wednesday, as a result of which the teams requested special dispensation from the ECB for an additional reserve day on the Thursday, which was granted. The wet weather continued, forcing the teams to play a bowl-out. Each team had to select five bowlers, each of whom had two deliveries at a set of unguarded <a href="Stump%20%28cricket%29">stumps</a>. Somerset won the bowl-out 5–1, with <a href="Ben%20Phillips%20%28cricketer%29">Ben Phillips</a>, <a href="Peter%20Trego">Peter Trego</a> and Willoughby each hitting the stumps once, and Thomas hitting them twice.

In the second semi-final of <a href="2009%20Twenty20%20Cup%23Finals%20Day">2009 Finals Day</a>, Somerset won the toss and elected to field against Kent. <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23E">Economical</a> bowling from Thomas and Willoughby, as well as the early wickets of <a href="Joe%20Denly">Joe Denly</a> and <a href="Martin%20van%20Jaarsveld">Martin van Jaarsveld</a>, helped to limit Kent to 145/5. On a slow pitch, Trescothick played what ESPNcricinfo's Andrew McGlashan described as a "brutal innings", scoring 56 runs off 32 balls. He shared an opening partnership of 73 with captain Langer, and by the time of Trescothick's dismissal after 8.1 overs, Somerset required 62 runs off 71 balls. Hildreth and de Bruyn took 10 overs to add another 57 runs, and after Hildreth was <a href="bowled">bowled</a> for 36, Kieswetter added two runs to grant Somerset victory with seven balls remaining. Against Sussex in the final, Somerset once again won the toss and elected to field. A strong batting display by Sussex, highlighted by <a href="Dwayne%20Smith">Dwayne Smith</a>'s 59 runs off 26 balls, set Somerset a target of 173 to win. In the opening overs of Somerset's reply, Trescothick scored powerfully, making the chase "look simple" according to McGlashan. However, after he was <a href="caught">caught</a> on 33, Somerset lost regular wickets. A partnership of 41 between de Bruyn and Trego steadied Somerset for a time, but when the pair were dismissed in subsequent overs, their team collapsed from 104/4 to 109 all out.

At the start of the competition, Somerset played with aggressive batting tactics, opening the innings with Kieswetter and Trescothick for the first six matches. This opening pair only passed 20 runs together on one occasion, against <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan</a>, and for the rest of the tournament, Kieswetter dropped down the batting order and Langer joined Trescothick at the top of the innings, in a move that Kieswetter said "adds a bit of balance to the side by putting a bit more firepower down the end and experience up top". The more experienced pair passed 40 runs together on four out of five occasions. The county's bowling relied heavily on medium pace, a fact which cricket writer <a href="Scyld%20Berry">Scyld Berry</a> suggested was exposed in the final.

Somerset's first match of the <a href="2009%20NatWest%20Pro40">2009 NatWest Pro40</a>, against Nottinghamshire, ended just one over short of the requirement for a match. Chasing 248 to win, Somerset were significantly behind the <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23R">required rate</a> when rain halted play in the ninth over. The side responded positively to this stroke of luck, winning their next three matches by significant margins, before losing to Essex. Having been put in to bat at Taunton, each of Somerset's top six batsman reached double figures, but none of them managed to pass 50 and the home side were eventually <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23A">all out</a> for 205. Despite taking early wickets during Essex's innings—at one stage having the visitors 12/3—the batting of <a href="John%20Maunders">John Maunders</a>, <a href="James%20Foster%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201980%29">James Foster</a> and <a href="Tim%20Phillips%20%28cricketer%29">Tim Phillips</a> propelled Essex past Somerset's total with five balls remaining. Two further victories ensured that Somerset entered their final match of the season with a chance to win the title.

Somerset had performed well but missed out narrowly in both the other one-day competitions in 2009, and could have clinched the competition with victory in their final match. News filtered through to the <a href="County%20Ground%2C%20Taunton">County Ground</a> during their final match, against <a href="Durham%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Durham</a>, that leaders <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a> had lost to <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a>, meaning that a win against the north-eastern team would guarantee Somerset the title. The result rarely looked likely; a rapid opening to the chase by Durham openers <a href="Phil%20Mustard">Phil Mustard</a> and <a href="Ian%20Blackwell">Ian Blackwell</a> provided a platform for their team to claim victory, and deny Somerset the title. Three of Somerset's bowlers claimed ten or more wickets in the competition (Ben Phillips, 14; Alfonso Thomas, 13; Charl Willoughby, 11), more than any other county in Division One.

By finishing as runners-up in the Twenty20 Cup, Somerset qualified to compete in the <a href="2009%20Champions%20League%20Twenty20">2009 Champions League Twenty20</a>, the first global club cricket tournament. Media attention surrounded Trescothick, who had returned home early from his <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%202006%E2%80%9307">last overseas tour in 2006–07</a> with a "stress-related illness". Brian Rose stressed that there was no pressure on Trescothick to take part in the tournament, and that the county would do everything possible to support him. The former England batsman did take part in the tournament, arriving three days after the rest of the squad. He played in both of Somerset's matches in the group stage of the competition, though he only managed to score 17 runs between his two innings.

Somerset won their first match, in which Alfonso Thomas scored two boundaries off the last three balls of the match to secure victory. Their opponents, <a href="Deccan%20Chargers">Deccan Chargers</a> scored 153 off their 20 overs, and with three wickets remaining, Somerset required 55 runs off 37 balls to win. A record eighth-wicket partnership between <a href="James%20Hildreth">James Hildreth</a> and Thomas of 50 brought the victory within reach, and Thomas' highest-score in Twenty20 cricket granted Somerset the win. Somerset lost their second match, being bowled out for their second-lowest Twenty20 total, 106 by <a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago%20national%20cricket%20team">Trinidad and Tobago</a>.

Somerset progressed to the second round of the competition after Trinidad and Tobago beat Deccan in the final group match, but lost Trescothick, who flew home after a recurrence of his illness. <a href="Wes%20Durston">Wes Durston</a>, who replaced Trescothick in the side, top-scored for Somerset in their next match, making 57. Only two other players reached double-figures for the county, and the <a href="Diamond%20Eagles">Diamond Eagles</a> chased down the total with eight balls to spare. Somerset went into their final match, against the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales Blues</a> with a slim mathematical chance of progressing, but a strong bowling display from <a href="Brett%20Lee">Brett Lee</a> and <a href="Stuart%20Clark">Stuart Clark</a> restricted Somerset to 111, which the Australian side reached with ease.

After the conclusion of the Champions League tournament, <a href="Justin%20Langer">Justin Langer</a> retired from professional cricket. Trescothick replaced him as Somerset captain for <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club%20in%202010">the 2010 season</a>. Somerset also lost <a href="Andrew%20Caddick">Andrew Caddick</a>, who at the age of 40 said that he opted to retire "while I was still physically and mentally strong". Wicket-keeper <a href="Carl%20Gazzard">Carl Gazzard</a> also announced his retirement at the end of the season aged 27, having lost his place in the Somerset side to <a href="Craig%20Kieswetter">Craig Kieswetter</a>. Additionally, Somerset released <a href="Wes%20Durston">Wes Durston</a> and <a href="Omari%20Banks">Omari Banks</a>, both of whom they felt were surplus to requirements. Somerset addressed the weakness of their spin bowling by signing <a href="Murali%20Kartik">Murali Kartik</a> as their overseas player for 2010.

Kieswetter's performances in the 2009 season led to his inclusion in the England Performance Programme squad in November and December of that year, and he was part of the <a href="England%20Lions%20cricket%20team">England Lions</a> squad which toured the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> in early 2010, along with Somerset team-mate <a href="Peter%20Trego">Peter Trego</a>.

Walden–Wallkill Rail Trail

The Walden–Wallkill Rail Trail, also known as the Jesse McHugh Rail Trail, is a <a href="rail%20trail">rail trail</a> between the <a href="Walden%2C%20New%20York">village of Walden</a>, New York and the neighboring <a href="Wallkill%2C%20Ulster%20County%2C%20New%20York">hamlet of Wallkill</a>. The two communities are located in <a href="Orange%20County%2C%20New%20York">Orange</a> and <a href="Ulster%20County%2C%20New%20York">Ulster</a> counties, respectively, in <a href="upstate%20New%20York">upstate New York</a>.

The trail, like the <a href="Wallkill%20Valley%20Rail%20Trail">Wallkill Valley Rail Trail</a> to the north, is part of the former <a href="Wallkill%20Valley%20Railroad">Wallkill Valley Railroad</a>'s rail corridor. The land was purchased by the towns of Montgomery and Shawangunk in 1985 and converted to a public trail. The portion of the trail in Shawangunk was formally opened in 1993 and named after former town supervisor Jesse McHugh. Plans to pave the trail between Walden and Wallkill were discussed since 2001, and the route was finally paved between 2008 and 2009. The trail includes an unofficial, unimproved section to the north of Wallkill, and is bounded by <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2052">NY 52</a> and <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20208">NY 208</a>.

Stretching from Montgomery to <a href="Kingston%2C%20New%20York">Kingston</a>, the Wallkill Valley Railroad operated from 1866 until its last regular freight run on December 31, 1977. In the 1980s, <a href="Conrail">Conrail</a>, then the owner of the Wallkill Valley line, attempted to sell the former rail corridor. The towns of Montgomery and Shawangunk – in Orange and Ulster counties, respectively – purchased their sections of the rail line to allow "development of a commercial corridor [as well as] utility easements and access" to a local reservoir.

The Montgomery section consisted of from the village of Walden to the town line with Shawangunk, and the Shawangunk section ran north from the town line to Birch Road. The purchases were completed in August and October 1985, respectively. In November of that year, the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Department%20of%20Correctional%20Services">New York State Department of Correctional Services</a> bought of the former corridor in Shawangunk's hamlet of Wallkill, near the <a href="Wallkill%20Correctional%20Facility">Wallkill Correctional Facility</a>. This portion extends from Birch Road to the town line with <a href="Gardiner%2C%20New%20York">Gardiner</a>. The <a href="Shawangunk%20Correctional%20Facility">Shawangunk Correctional Facility</a> was built at that location. South of Walden, the corridor remains an active rail line operated by the <a href="Norfolk%20Southern%20Railway">Norfolk Southern Railway</a>.

North of the prisons, the former corridor continues as the separate Wallkill Valley Rail Trail. Rail trail enthusiasts have been trying to find a way to combine the two rail trails since the 1990s, and in 2004 the town of Shawangunk commissioned an open space study that identified possible ways to accomplish such a connection. A 2008 Ulster County transportation plan included projects to connect the trails, and the town of Shawangunk is currently considering plans to connect the trails by diverting the corridor along Birch Road. The original route of the corridor is within the prisons' perimeter fence.
The portion of the former corridor running through the center of Wallkill was converted to a road, Railroad Avenue. The southern part of the route, running from Wallkill to the Montgomery–Shawangunk town line, was officially opened as the Jesse McHugh Rail Trail on June 5, 1993. Jesse McHugh was a former Shawangunk town supervisor. The northern portion of the Shawangunk section, which stretches to the border of the prison grounds, is maintained by the town but not officially part of the trail.

In 2001, Shawangunk, Montgomery and the Walden began applying for over $600,000 in <a href="Transportation%20Equity%20Act%20for%20the%2021st%20Century">TEA-21</a> grants to create a paved, <a href="Americans%20with%20Disabilities%20Act%20of%201990">Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990</a> (ADA)-accessible trail between Walden and Wallkill. The total cost of paving the trail was expected to be $750,000, though it eventually ballooned to $1.5 million. The decision to pave the trail was vehemently opposed by horseback riders who felt it would endanger them, and protested at several public meetings by the Mid-Hudson Horse Trails Association. The decision was also opposed by nearby homeowners who believed an increase in trail use would threaten their privacy.

In October 2003, Walden, Shawangunk and Montgomery acquired the $600,000 grant needed to begin paving the trail. Two months later, Bob and Doris Kimball, a couple in Montgomery, donated of their land to create a park by the trail near Lake Osiris Road. The park is expected to be developed once funds are available to do so. Nearly $200,000 in funding to complete pavement of the trail was lost when the outgoing <a href="109th%20United%20States%20Congress">109th Congress</a> did not approve a 2006 budget bill. In February 2008, Congressman <a href="Maurice%20Hinchey">Maurice Hinchey</a> announced the appropriation of $351,000 to complete the project. Construction began on September 22, 2008, and the paved trail opened on May 2, 2009. Flooding from <a href="2011%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">hurricanes in 2011</a> caused a cave-in along the Montgomery section of the trial. The storms eroded much of the ground beneath the trail, causing the ground to sink. , no repairs have been completed; the cost of fully repairing the trail was estimated to be $214,000.

The trail begins at the Wooster Grove Park in the village of Walden, near <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2052">NY 52</a>. There is a visitor center for rail trail users at the park. The park also contains Walden's former train station, which has since been renovated as a recreational facility.

The trail continues north from the trailhead before reaching Lake Osiris Road, continuing another to the Montgomery–Shawangunk town line. Once in Shawangunk, the trail passes by the Borden Estate, a mansion built in 1906 by the granddaughter of <a href="Gail%20Borden">Gail Borden</a>. In 1854, Gail Borden patented the process for creating <a href="condensed%20milk">condensed milk</a>; the Borden family subsequently owned a series of milk companies. The mansion is now used by the <a href="School%20of%20Practical%20Philosophy">School of Practical Philosophy</a> for philosophy classes.
About from the town line, the trail reaches its Wallkill trailhead bordering <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20208">NY 208</a>, directly across the street from the Shawangunk police station. The paved section between Walden and Wallkill is flat, with only a 3% grade. A portion of the former corridor in central Wallkill has since been converted to a road.

An unimproved northern section in Wallkill extends from the intersection of Railroad Avenue and C. E. Penny Drive to Birch Road. Birch Road marks the border between the former corridor and two state prisons. This section passes through private hunting grounds and is "unmarked and has no signs" but is "arguably ... the most scenic" portion of the former Wallkill Valley rail corridor, featuring "splendid" views of the <a href="Shawangunk%20Ridge">Shawangunk Ridge</a> to the west.

While the total length of the trail is officially only about , the inclusion of the northern section increases its length to about . The trail is used for walking, jogging, bicycling and dog walking.

Seorsumuscardinus

Seorsumuscardinus is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="fossil">fossil</a> <a href="dormice">dormice</a> from the early <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> of Europe. It is known from zone <a href="MN%204%20%28biostratigraphic%20zone%29">MN 4</a> (see <a href="MN%20zonation">MN zonation</a>) in <a href="Oberdorf%20am%20Hochegg">Oberdorf</a>, <a href="Austria">Austria</a>; <a href="Karydia%2C%20Rhodope">Karydia</a>, <a href="Greece">Greece</a>; and <a href="T%C3%A4gernaustrasse-Jona">Tägernaustrasse-Jona</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, and from zone <a href="MN%205%20%28biostratigraphic%20zone%29">MN 5</a> in a single site at <a href="Affalterbach%2C%20Pfaffenhofen%20an%20der%20Ilm">Affalterbach</a>, Germany. The MN 4 records are placed in the species S. alpinus and the sole MN 5 record is classified as the species S. bolligeri. The latter was placed in a separate genus, "Heissigia", when it was first described in 2007, but it was reclassified as a second species of "Seorsumuscardinus" in 2009.

The two species of "Seorsumuscardinus" are known from isolated teeth, which show that they were medium-sized dormice with flat teeth. The teeth are all characterized by long transverse crests coupled with shorter ones. One of these crests, the <a href="anterotropid">anterotropid</a>, distinguishes the two species, as it is present in the lower molars of "S. alpinus", but not in those of "S. bolligeri". Another crest, the <a href="centroloph">centroloph</a>, reaches the outer margin of the first upper molar in "S. bolligeri", but not in "S. alpinus". "Seorsumuscardinus" may be related to "<a href="Muscardinus">Muscardinus</a>", the genus of the living <a href="hazel%20dormouse">hazel dormouse</a>, which appears at about the same time, and the older "<a href="Glirudinus">Glirudinus</a>".

In 1992, Thomas Bolliger described some teeth of "Seorsumuscardinus" from the Swiss locality of Tägernaustrasse (<a href="MN%204%20%28biostratigraphic%20zone%29">MN 4</a>; <a href="early%20Miocene">early Miocene</a>, see <a href="MN%20zonation">MN zonation</a>) as an indeterminate <a href="dormouse">dormouse</a> (family Gliridae) perhaps related to "Eomuscardinus". Six years later, <a href="Hans%20de%20Bruijn">Hans de Bruijn</a> named the new genus and species "Seorsumuscardinus alpinus" on the basis of material from <a href="Oberdorf%20am%20Hochegg">Oberdorf</a> in Austria (also MN 4) and included fossils from Tägernaustrasse and from <a href="Karydia%2C%20Rhodope">Karydia</a> in Greece (MN 4) in "Seorsumuscardinus". In 2007, Jerome Prieto and Madeleine Böhme named "Heissigia bolligeri" as a new genus and species from <a href="Affalterbach%2C%20Pfaffenhofen%20an%20der%20Ilm">Affalterbach</a> in <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> (<a href="MN%205%20%28biostratigraphic%20zone%29">MN 5</a>, younger than MN 4), and referred the Tägernaustrasse material to it, but failed to compare their new genus to "Seorsumuscardinus". Two years later, Prieto published a note to compare the two and concluded that they were referable to the same genus, but different species. Thus, the genus "Seorsumuscardinus" now includes the species "Seorsumuscardinus alpinus" from MN 4 and "S. bolligeri" from MN 5. Prieto provisionally placed the Tägernaustrasse material with "S. alpinus". He also mentioned "<a href="Pentaglis">Pentaglis földváry</a>", a name given to a single upper molar from the <a href="middle%20Miocene">middle Miocene</a> of Hungary, which is now lost. Although the specimen shows some similarities with "Seorsumuscardinus", published illustrations are too poor to confirm the identity of "Pentaglis", and Prieto considered the latter name to be an unidentifiable "<a href="nomen%20dubium">nomen dubium</a>".

Because of its <a href="Synapomorphy">derived</a> and specialized <a href="morphology%20%28anatomy%29">morphology</a>, the relationships of "Seorsumuscardinus" are obscure. However, it shows some similarities with "<a href="Muscardinus">Muscardinus</a>", a genus which includes the living <a href="hazel%20dormouse">hazel dormouse</a>, and may share a common ancestor with it, such as the earlier fossil genus "<a href="Glirudinus">Glirudinus</a>". All three are part of the dormouse family, which includes many extinct forms dating back to the <a href="early%20Eocene">early Eocene</a> (around 50 million years ago), as well as a smaller array of living species. The <a href="name%20of%20a%20biological%20genus">generic name</a> "Seorsumuscardinus" combines the Latin "seorsum", which means "different", with "Muscardinus" and the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "alpinus" refers to the occurrence of "S. alpinus" close to the Alps. "Heissigia" honored paleontologist Kurt Heissig for his work in Bavaria on the occasion of his 65th birthday and "bolligeri" honors Thomas Bolliger for his early description of material of this dormouse.

Only the <a href="cheek%20teeth">cheek teeth</a> of "Seorsumuscardinus" are known; these include the fourth <a href="premolar">premolar</a> and three <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a> in the upper (<a href="maxilla">maxilla</a>) and lower jaws (<a href="mandible">mandible</a>). The teeth are medium-sized for a dormouse and have a flat <a href="Occlusion%20%28dentistry%29">occlusal</a> (chewing) surface. "S. bolligeri" is slightly larger than "S. alpinus".

The fourth upper premolar (P4) has four main, transversely placed crests; the description of "S. bolligeri" mentions an additional, centrally placed small crest. De Bruijn interpreted the four main crests as the <a href="anteroloph">anteroloph</a>, <a href="protoloph">protoloph</a>, <a href="metaloph">metaloph</a>, and <a href="posteroloph">posteroloph</a> from front to back and wrote that these crests are not connected on the sides of the tooth. Prieto and Böhme note that the posteroloph is convex on the back margin of the tooth. In "Muscardinus", the number of ridges on P4 ranges from five in "<a href="Muscardinus%20sansaniensis">Muscardinus sansaniensis</a>" to two in "<a href="Muscardinus%20pliocaenicus">M. pliocaenicus</a>" and the living hazel dormouse, but the protoloph and metaloph are always connected on the lingual (inner) side of the tooth. P4 is two-rooted in "S. alpinus" and three-rooted in "S. bolligeri".

The first upper molar (M1) was described as square by De Bruijn and as rounded by Prieto and Böhme. There are five main transverse crests, which are mostly isolated, but some may be connected on the borders of the teeth. The middle crest, the <a href="centroloph">centroloph</a>, reaches to the labial (outer) margin in the single known M1 of "S. bolligeri", but does not in any of the five M1 of "S. alpinus". The front crest, the anteroloph, is less distinct in "S. bolligeri" than most "S. alpinus", but one M1 of "S. alpinus" is similar to that of "S. bolligeri". M1 has three roots in "S. alpinus", but the number of roots in "S. bolligeri" is not known.

Prieto and Böhme describe M2 as less rounded than M1 and De Bruijn notes that the crests are more parallel. In addition to the five main crests, small crests are present in front of and behind the centroloph that do not cover the full width of the tooth. In one "S. bolligeri" M2, there is a small crest on the lingual side in front of the centroloph, but such a crest does not occur in any "S. alpinus". Another M2 of "S. bolligeri" has this crest on the labial side. On the other hand, all five M2 of "S. alpinus" have a minor crest on the labial side behind the centroloph. In two M2 of "S. alpinus", the centroloph and the metaloph are connected by a longitudinal crest, which is never present in "S. bolligeri". There are three roots.

M3 is known from a single specimen each from Oberdorf, Affalterbach, and Tägernaustrasse. In addition to the main crests, there are two or three additional smaller crests. The roots are unknown.

The fourth lower premolar (p4) is known from a poorly preserved specimen from Oberdorf and a less worn specimen from Tägernaustrasse. There are four ridges, of which the front and back pair are connected at the lingual side and in the Oberdorf specimen also at the labial side. This tooth is similar to that of "Muscardinus hispanicus", but the front pair is better developed. There is one root.

The first lower molar (m1) bears four main crests and a smaller one between the two crests at the back. An additional crest (the <a href="anterotropid">anterotropid</a>) is present between the two front crests, the <a href="anterolophid">anterolophid</a> and the <a href="metalophid">metalophid</a>, in "S. alpinus", but not in "S. bolligeri". The occlusal pattern of m2 resembles that of m1. "S. bolligeri" also lacks an anterotropid on m2, but the tooth is not known from Oberdorf. In a worn m2 from Tägernaustrasse, there is a thickened portion in the labial part of the anterolophid, which Prieto interpreted as a remnant of the anterotropid; this led him to identify the Tägernaustrasse population as "S." <a href="cf.">cf.</a> "alpinus". Only Oberdorf has yielded the m3 of "Seorsumuscardinus". It resembles the m1 and has a short anterotropid, but has more oblique crests. In "S. alpinus", the lower molars have two and occasionally three roots. The roots of the m1 of "S. bolligeri" are not preserved and the m2 has two roots.

In MN 4, "Seorsumuscardinus" has been recorded from Oberdorf, Austria (sites 3 and 4, which yielded 6 and 17 "Seorsumuscardinus alpinus" teeth, respectively); Karydia, Greece ("S. alpinus"); and Tägernaustrasse, Switzerland (5 teeth; "S." cf. "alpinus"). Affalterbach, Germany, where 10 teeth of "S. bolligeri" were found, is the only known MN 5 locality. In all these localities, it is part of a diverse dormouse fauna. Because the distributions of the two known species are temporally distinct, Prieto suggested that the genus may be useful for <a href="biostratigraphy">biostratigraphy</a> (the use of fossils to determine the age of deposits). "Seorsumuscardinus" occurred at the same time as the oldest known "Muscardinus".

Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht, BWV 134a

<a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a> composed the <a href="List%20of%20secular%20cantatas%20by%20Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">secular cantata</a> (Time, which day and year doth make), <a href="BWV">BWV</a>134.1, BWV134a, while he was in the service of the court of <a href="Leopold%2C%20Prince%20of%20Anhalt-K%C3%B6then">Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen</a>. Bach wrote the work as a "<a href="serenata">serenata</a>" for the celebration of <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Day">New Year's Day</a> 1719.

The libretto by <a href="Christian%20Friedrich%20Hunold">Christian Friedrich Hunold</a>, an academic at the <a href="University%20of%20Halle">University of Halle</a>, takes the form of a dialogue between two <a href="Allegory">allegorical</a> figures, "Time" and "Divine Providence", representing the past and future, respectively. Bach set the words in eight <a href="Movement%20%28music%29">movements</a> consisting of alternating <a href="recitative">recitative</a>s and <a href="aria">aria</a>s, culminating in a choral finale. Most movements are duets of solo voices, an <a href="alto">alto</a> as "Divine Providence" and a <a href="tenor">tenor</a> as "Time". Even the closing movement features long duet passages, leading to parts for <a href="SATB">four voices</a>. The singers are supported by a <a href="Baroque%20instruments">baroque instrumental</a> ensemble of two oboes, two violins, viola and <a href="Figured%20bass%23Basso%20continuo">continuo</a>. The character of the music is close to <a href="baroque%20opera">baroque opera</a>, including French dances.

Later, in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, Bach used the secular cantata as the basis for a church cantata for the <a href="Church%20cantata%23Easter%20Tuesday%20%28Easter%203%29">Third Day of Easter</a> 1724, . In the initial version of the Easter cantata, he made no changes to the 1719 music other than to omit two movements and replace the text with words for the occasion, written by an unknown author. In an adaptation for performances in the 1730s, he composed new recitatives for the Easter texts and made further changes to the music.

The cantata, written for a specific occasion, has been performed and recorded rarely, compared with other <a href="Bach%20cantata">Bach cantata</a>s. It has been used for congratulatory events such as the 80th birthday of Bach scholar <a href="Alfred%20D%C3%BCrr">Alfred Dürr</a>, when the cantata title was chosen as that of an international conference about chronology in Bach's music, on which Dürr had focused.
Bach composed in <a href="K%C3%B6then">Köthen</a>, where he served at the court of <a href="Leopold%2C%20Prince%20of%20Anhalt-K%C3%B6then">Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen</a>, between 1717 and 1723. Bach had earlier been employed at the subordinate position of <a href="concert%20master">concert master</a> at the <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a> court, now was "<a href="Kapellmeister">Kapellmeister</a>" in Köthen, directing a qualified musical ensemble.
The prince was enthusiastic about music, was a good bass singer, and played violin, viola da gamba and harpsichord. The court adhered to the <a href="Calvinism">Reformed Church</a>; therefore, Bach had no obligation to compose church music as he had in his earlier posts and later as "<a href="Thomaskantor">Thomaskantor</a>" in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>. In Köthen, he had to write cantatas only for the court's two secular feast days: the prince's birthday and New Year's Day. He wrote as a congratulatory cantata for <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Day">New Year's Day</a> of 1719.

Only few cantatas survived of the twelve that Bach is thought to have composed in his six years while in Köthen", including , composed for the prince's birthday, probably in 1722. The homage cantatas were performed as "serenatas" or evening serenades. Their style is similar to opera of the period and includes dance-like music.

"Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht" is based on words by <a href="Christian%20Friedrich%20Hunold">Christian Friedrich Hunold</a>, whose pen name was Menantes. A <a href="novelist">novelist</a> as well as a <a href="libretto">librettist</a>, Hunold taught at the <a href="University%20of%20Halle">University of Halle</a>, about from Köthen. Bach collaborated with him on several cantatas between 1718 and 1720. Hunold published the text in the collection (Selected and partly never printed poems of different notable and skillful men) in <a href="Halle%20%28Saale%29">Halle</a> in 1719. Other texts published by Hunold include that of Bach's cantata , written for the prince's birthday on 10 December 1718. Literally "Heaven thought of Anhalt's glory and fortune", it has also been translated in a singable version as "Since Heaven Cared for Anhalt's Fame and Bliss".

The text of the serenata , for most of the movements, recounts a dialogue between two <a href="Allegory">allegorical</a> figures: "Time", representing the past, and "Divine Providence", representing the future. The music remained in manuscript and, like most of Bach's works, was not <a href="List%20of%20compositions%20by%20Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach%20printed%20during%20his%20lifetime">printed in his lifetime</a>. Bach led the first performance of the cantata on 1 January 1719.

Bach later used the secular cantata in Leipzig as a basis for the Easter cantata , which was first performed in the <a href="St.%20Nicholas%20Church%2C%20Leipzig">Nikolaikirche</a> on 11 April 1724. In the first version of this Easter cantata, Bach made no significant changes to the music other than omitting the fifth and sixth movements. The new text, by an unknown poet, did not require musical adaptation. Bach had the parts for the singers of the retained movements copied without text and added the new text himself, with minor changes to the music. The instrumental parts were usable without changes but were duplicated for more performers. Perhaps for lack of time, Bach managed only the first page of a score with the new text and probably conducted from the Köthen score.

For another performance of the Easter cantata on 27 March 1731, Bach made changes to the music, including the composition of new recitatives for the 1724 text. He probably used this revised version again on 12 April 1735 and likely wrote a new score for this occasion.

With the revival of interest in Bach's music in the 19th century, <a href="Philipp%20Spitta">Philipp Spitta</a>, the author of <a href="Spitta%27s%20Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">a three-volume biography</a> of Bach, discovered the printed text, making reconstruction of the entire work possible. The editors of the <a href="Bach%20Gesellschaft">Bach-Gesellschaft-Ausgabe</a>, the first complete edition of the composer's works, were aware of the cantata and observed its relationship to BWV 134. However, the Bach-Gesellschaft-Ausgabe printed in 1881 only as a fragment edited by Paul Waldersee. It is titled , which is a line from the first tenor aria. In 1963, the cantata was published in the "<a href="Neue%20Bach-Ausgabe">Neue Bach-Ausgabe</a>" (NBA), the second complete edition of Bach's works, edited by <a href="Alfred%20D%C3%BCrr">Alfred Dürr</a>, with a critical report the following year.

The cantata is structured in eight movements, with alternating <a href="recitative">recitative</a>s and <a href="aria">aria</a>s including mostly duets, culminating in a final choral movement. Bach scored the work for two soloists, <a href="alto">alto</a> as "Divine Providence" and <a href="tenor">tenor</a> as "Time", a <a href="SATB">four-part choir</a> (<a href="SATB"></a>), and a <a href="Baroque%20instruments">baroque instrumental</a> ensemble of two <a href="oboe">oboe</a>s (Ob), two <a href="violin">violin</a>s (Vl), <a href="viola">viola</a> (Va) and <a href="basso%20continuo">basso continuo</a>. The duration is given as 41 minutes.

In the following table, the scoring follows the ("New Bach Edition"). The <a href="Key%20%28music%29">keys</a> and <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a>s are from Alfred Dürr and use the symbol for common time. The continuo, played throughout, is not shown.

The cantata develops from a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias to a final chorus. This structure is similar to other cantatas Bach composed in Köthen, but it is different from most of his church cantatas, which begin with a weighty choral movement and end with a four-part chorale. All recitatives and one aria are dialogues. The recitatives are <a href="secco%20recitative">secco recitative</a>s, accompanied only by the continuo. Richard D. P. Jones notes that the music of the Köthen secular cantatas is abundant in duets in the spirit of opera, with dances in Italian and French style.

The cantata begins with a recitative for both solo voices, "Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht" (Time, which day and year doth make). It reflects that <a href="History%20of%20Saxony-Anhalt">Anhalt</a>, the prince's domain, was given many hours of blessing in the past.

The second movement is an aria for tenor, "Auf, Sterbliche, lasset ein Jauchzen ertönen" (Arise, mortals, let your jubilation resound), calling the people to give thanks for the blessings. An <a href="obbligato">obbligato</a> oboe dominates the movement.

The next recitative for both voices, "So bald, als dir die Sternen hold, o höchstgepriesnes Fürstentum" (As soon as the stars were favorable to you, o highly praised princedom), addresses Leopold, the ruler.

The fourth movement is a duet aria, in which the soloists sing slightly different text. The alto as Divine Providence considers the future: "Es streiten, es siegen die künftigen Zeiten im Segen für dieses durchlauchtigste Haus." (The future times struggle, they triumph in blessings for this illustrious house.) The tenor as Time looks at the past: "Es streiten, es prangen die vorigen Zeiten im Segen für dieses durchlauchtigste Haus." (The past times struggle, they glory in blessings for this illustrious house.) Bach's instrumentation complements the text well, accompanying the movement by the strings alone to match the text "strings of the heart". The competition of Time and Divine Providence is expressed in virtuoso singing and illustrated by figurations in the first violins.

The next recitative, again for both voices, "Bedenke nur, beglücktes Land, wieviel ich dir in dieser Zeit gegeben" (Yet consider, fortunate land, how much I have given you at this time), gives some details about Leopold's qualities and calls to pray for further happiness.

The second solo aria is for the alto, "Der Zeiten Herr hat viel vergnügte Stunden, du Götterhaus, dir annoch beigelegt" (The Lord of Ages has many happy hours, o godly house, bestowed upon you). Accompanied only by the continuo in <a href="ostinato">ostinato</a> motives, it freely expresses the "" (harmony of the souls).

The last recitative is again for both voices, "Hilf, Höchster, hilf, daß mich die Menschen preisen" (Help, o Highest, help, so that all people praise me), and calls for divine help to praise God and pray for further protection.

The cantata culminates in a choral movement opening by the tenor's "" (Delight upon earth), followed by the alto's "" (rejoice on high), then all voices sing together in <a href="homophony">homophony</a> "" (blessed ages, bring joy to this house). The pattern is repeated two more times, increasing in richness. The middle section is again started by alto and tenor, but this time together. With the following words, "" (May they flourish, may they live), a <a href="Fugue">fugal</a> development of all voices begins, quite similar to the opening chorus of , a fast succession of the voices and a long <a href="melisma">melisma</a> on the word , creating lively music. Alto and tenor start a fugue twice more, singing increasingly embellished lines on "" (most illustrious souls). Close to the end of the middle section all voices shout together the word (shout) twice, accented by a following rest. Then, the complete first part is repeated <a href="da%20capo">da capo</a>.

The lively finale in 3/8 time and with regular phrases, like the French <a href="gigue">gigue</a> or <a href="passepied">passepied</a>, is typical of Bach's secular cantatas in Köthen. He had written music like this before in <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a> cantatas, for example the opening of the cantata for Pentecost , and he would use it again in compositions in Leipzig, both secular and sacred.

The following table is based on the list at the Bach Cantatas website. While the derived Easter cantata was included in the complete recordings of Bach's church cantatas by <a href="Nikolaus%20Harnoncourt">Nikolaus Harnoncourt</a> and <a href="Gustav%20Leonhardt">Gustav Leonhardt</a>, <a href="Helmuth%20Rilling">Helmuth Rilling</a>, <a href="Ton%20Koopman">Ton Koopman</a>, <a href="Pieter%20Jan%20Leusink">Pieter Jan Leusink</a>, <a href="John%20Eliot%20Gardiner">John Eliot Gardiner</a> and <a href="Masaaki%20Suzuki">Masaaki Suzuki</a>, the festive secular cantata dedicated to the specific occasion was recorded only a few times. In the table, ensembles playing period instruments in <a href="historically%20informed%20performance">historically informed performance</a>s are indicated by a green background.

The first recording was made in 1996, conducted by <a href="Wolfgang%20Unger">Wolfgang Unger</a>, who had revived in 1992 the <a href="Leipziger%20Universit%C3%A4tsmusik">Leipziger Universitätsmusik</a>, ensembles formed by students and teachers of the <a href="University%20of%20Leipzig">University of Leipzig</a>. He paired the cantata with "<a href="Die%20Freude%20reget%20sich%2C%20BWV%2036b">"Die Freude reget sich", BWV 36b</a>.

Koopman recorded the cantata in 1998 as part of volume 10 of his complete recordings of Bach's church cantatas, combined with the Easter cantata based on it and with other church cantatas.

In 2000, Rilling recorded, as volume 139 of Bach's cantatas, five "Congratulatory and Hommage Cantatas", two of them for the first time: "Angenehmes Wiederau" and "Schwingt freudig euch empor".

In his 2011 recording, Suzuki paired the cantata with the "<a href="Hunting%20Cantata">Hunting Cantata</a>" and the Sinfonia in F major, BWV 1046a/1, from an early version of the <a href="Brandenburg%20Concerto">Brandenburg Concerto</a> No. 1, with the same scoring as the "Hunting Cantata". Reviewer Parry-Ridout notes the "purity of tone" of the alto, the "richness and expression" of the tenor, and the virtuosity of both when competing in a duet.

The cantata was performed in 2011 to conclude the festival Köthener Herbst in the Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Saal of <a href="Schloss%20K%C3%B6then">Schloss Köthen</a>. The program was <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Abel">Carl Friedrich Abel</a>'s Symphony No. 1, Bach's cantata <a href="Durchlauchtster%20Leopold%2C%20BWV%20173a">"Durchlauchtster Leopold", BWV 173a</a>, his "<a href="Brandenburg%20Concertos">Brandenburg Concerto</a>" No. 4, and finally "Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht", with soloists <a href="Veronika%20Winter">Veronika Winter</a>, <a href="Franz%20Vitzthum">Franz Vitzthum</a>, Immo Schröder and Matthias Vieweg, and the ensemble Das Kleine Konzert, conducted by <a href="Hermann%20Max">Hermann Max</a>.

In 1998, an international <a href="musicology">musicological</a> conference was held in <a href="G%C3%B6ttingen">Göttingen</a>, Germany, on the occasion of the 80th birthday of Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, who had devoted his life to studies of Bach's works and their chronology. It was titled "'Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht': zur Chronologie des Schaffens von Johann Sebastian Bach", and featured a public performance of the cantata. Essays by the international musicologists who gathered, such as <a href="Hans-Joachim%20Schulze">Hans-Joachim Schulze</a>, <a href="Andreas%20Gl%C3%B6ckner">Andreas Glöckner</a> and <a href="Jean-Claude%20Zehnder">Jean-Claude Zehnder</a>, were published. Most of them focused specifically on the person's field of expertise in relation to Dürr's achievements.

2010 U.S. Open Cup Final

The 2010 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final was played on October 5, 2010, at <a href="Qwest%20Field">Qwest Field</a> (since renamed CenturyLink Field) in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>. The match determined the winner of the <a href="2010%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">2010 U.S. Open Cup</a>, a tournament open to amateur and professional soccer teams affiliated with the <a href="United%20States%20Soccer%20Federation">United States Soccer Federation</a>. This was the 97th edition of <a href="Lamar%20Hunt%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">the oldest competition</a> in United States soccer. <a href="Seattle%20Sounders%20FC">Seattle Sounders FC</a> won the match, defeating the <a href="Columbus%20Crew">Columbus Crew</a> 2–1 in front of a sellout crowd of 31,311, the highest attendance at a U.S. Open Cup final. <a href="Kevin%20Burns%20%28soccer%29">Kevin Burns</a> scored first, giving the Columbus Crew an early lead. <a href="Sanna%20Nyassi">Sanna Nyassi</a> then scored both goals for Seattle Sounders FC as it became the first team since 1983 to win two consecutive U.S. Open Cup championships.

Both the Columbus Crew and Seattle Sounders FC qualified automatically for the third round of the U.S. Open Cup tournament by finishing among the top six in the <a href="2009%20Major%20League%20Soccer%20season">2009 Major League Soccer season</a> standings. Both clubs won three matches in the tournament to advance to the final. Seattle won the bidding process to host the final.

As a result of its U.S. Open Cup championship, Sounders FC earned a berth in the preliminary round of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League</a>, as well as a $100,000 cash prize. The Crew received the runner-up prize of $50,000.

The U.S. Open Cup is an annual American soccer competition open to all <a href="United%20States%20Soccer%20Federation">United States Soccer Federation</a> affiliated teams, from amateur adult club teams to the professional clubs of <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer">Major League Soccer</a> (MLS). The 2010 tournament was the 97th edition of the oldest soccer tournament in the United States.

In 2010, MLS, which has teams that play in both the United States and Canada, was allowed to enter eight of its U.S.-based teams in the tournament. The top six MLS teams from the previous season's league table qualified automatically for the tournament, while the remaining two spots are determined by preliminary <a href="2010%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup%20qualification">qualification matches</a>. The eight MLS entries began play in the third round of the tournament. In 2009, both <a href="Seattle%20Sounders%20FC">Seattle Sounders FC</a> and the <a href="Columbus%20Crew">Columbus Crew</a> finished among the top six teams in MLS overall league standings and therefore qualified automatically for the third round of the 2010 U.S. Open Cup.

Prior to 2010 the Columbus Crew had been to the U.S. Open Cup final twice, in 1998 and again in 2002, winning the cup in the latter appearance. On June 29, 2010, the Crew began the competition in the third round, hosting the <a href="Rochester%20Rhinos">Rochester Rhinos</a> of the <a href="USSF%20Division%202%20Professional%20League">D2 Pro League</a> at <a href="Columbus%20Crew%20Stadium">Columbus Crew Stadium</a> in <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a> in front of a crowd of 1,760. The Crew's <a href="Andy%20Iro">Andy Iro</a> scored in the 30th minute by heading in a <a href="corner%20kick">corner kick</a> from teammate <a href="Eddie%20Gaven">Eddie Gaven</a>. In the second half, Rochester evened the score when substitute <a href="Darren%20Spicer">Darren Spicer</a> scored from 17 yards out. The Rhinos' <a href="Alfonso%20Motagalvan">Alfonso Motagalvan</a> was <a href="sent%20off">sent off</a> in the 84th minute for a dangerous tackle on <a href="Emilio%20Renter%C3%ADa">Emilio Rentería</a>, forcing Rochester to play the final minutes of the game with 10 men. The score remained level until the fourth minute of <a href="stoppage%20time">stoppage time</a>, when <a href="Steven%20Lenhart">Steven Lenhart</a> scored with a volley over the onrushing goalkeeper to give Columbus the victory.

A week later, on July 6, Columbus faced the <a href="Charleston%20Battery">Charleston Battery</a> of the <a href="USL%20Second%20Division">USL Second Division</a> in the U.S. Open Cup quarterfinals. The match was hosted by Columbus, again at Crew Stadium in front of a crowd of 1,847. In the 37th minute, Lenhart was fouled in the penalty area while going for a cross and the referee signaled for a <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty kick</a>. Rentería took the penalty kick and drove a right-footed shot into the back of the net, making the score 1–0. Columbus extended its lead in the 70th minute through a goal from Lenhart, and again in the 87th minute when Gaven scored from a pass from <a href="Emmanuel%20Ekpo">Emmanuel Ekpo</a>. The Crew won 3–0, earning its first U.S. Open Cup semifinal appearance since 2002.

On September 1, 2010, the Columbus Crew visited Washington, D.C. to face MLS club <a href="D.C.%20United">D.C. United</a> in the semifinal match at <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy%20Memorial%20Stadium">RFK Stadium</a> in front of a crowd of 3,411. <a href="Pablo%20Hern%C3%A1ndez%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201986%29">Pablo Hernandez</a> scored in the 17th minute on a penalty kick to give D.C. an early lead which it almost held for the victory. However, in the 89th minute D.C.'s <a href="Marc%20Burch">Marc Burch</a> deflected a shot by Columbus's Iro into the net for an <a href="own%20goal">own goal</a>, tying the score and sending the match into <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">extra time</a>. In the 97th minute, the Crew's Lenhart <a href="Dribbling">dribbled</a> the ball into the 18-yard box and was tripped by D.C. United's <a href="Carey%20Talley">Carey Talley</a> to draw a penalty. <a href="Guillermo%20Barros%20Schelotto">Guillermo Barros Schelotto</a> took the penalty kick and scored the winning goal. The 2–1 final score secured the Crew's spot in the final.

Seattle won the <a href="2009%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup%20Final">2009 U.S. Open Cup</a>—the second MLS <a href="Expansion%20team">expansion club</a> to do so in its inaugural season after the <a href="Chicago%20Fire%20S.C.">Chicago Fire</a> in 1998. Prior to the final, Sounders FC played U.S. Open Cup home games at the <a href="Starfire%20Sports%20Complex">Starfire Sports Complex</a> in <a href="Tukwila%2C%20Washington">Tukwila, Washington</a>. The facility is smaller than the club's home stadium for league matches, <a href="Qwest%20Field">Qwest Field</a>, but Sounders FC representatives preferred the atmosphere at Starfire for smaller cup matches.

On June 30, 2010, Seattle began the defense of its title in a match hosted by the <a href="Portland%20Timbers%20%282001%E2%80%9310%29">Portland Timbers</a> of the D2 Pro League in Portland, Oregon, at <a href="PGE%20Park">PGE Park</a> in front of a crowd of 15,422. Sounders FC took the lead in the 13th minute on a header from <a href="Nate%20Jaqua">Nate Jaqua</a>, but the Timbers levelled the score in the 38th minute when <a href="Bright%20Dike">Bright Dike</a> scored on a shot from inside the <a href="penalty%20area">penalty area</a>. The score was 1–1 at halftime, and remained that way through full-time and extra time. Seattle finally defeated Portland in a 4–3 <a href="Penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shootout</a> with <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a> <a href="Kasey%20Keller">Kasey Keller</a> making two saves and <a href="Defender%20%28association%20football%29">defender</a> <a href="Zach%20Scott">Zach Scott</a> scoring the winning penalty kick.

Sounders FC hosted its quarterfinal match a week later on July 7 against an MLS club, the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Galaxy">Los Angeles Galaxy</a>, at Starfire Sports Complex in front of a sellout crowd of 4,512. Seattle <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29">forward</a> Jaqua again led the attack scoring two goals in the second half. The first came in the 50th minute when he headed in a rebound off the crossbar and the second came in the 62nd minute off a cross from <a href="Miguel%20Monta%C3%B1o">Miguel Montaño</a>. Seattle won 2–0. Sounders FC's reserve goalkeeper <a href="Terry%20Boss">Terry Boss</a> also made two saves in his first start for the team.

On September 1, 2010, Seattle hosted its semifinal match against another MLS club, <a href="Chivas%20USA">Chivas USA</a>. Like the quarterfinal, it was hosted at Starfire with a sellout crowd of 4,547. Jaqua gained Seattle an early lead in the 10th minute off a <a href="Steve%20Zakuani">Steve Zakuani</a> cross. Zakuani was involved again in the 58th minute, this time crossing to a diving <a href="Fredy%20Montero">Fredy Montero</a> who increased the lead to two. Chivas USA's <a href="Jes%C3%BAs%20Padilla">Jesús Padilla</a> scored in the 68th minute on a through ball from <a href="Justin%20Braun%20%28soccer%29">Justin Braun</a> cutting the deficit to one. However, in second half <a href="stoppage%20time">stoppage time</a>, Jaqua scored again making the score 3–1 and sealing the Sounders FC victory and an appearance in the tournament final. Jaqua's two goals raised his total to five in the tournament. Zakuani, who had just returned from a pelvic strain injury, had two <a href="Assist%20%28football%29">assists</a> in the match.

On August 26, 2010, <a href="United%20States%20Soccer%20Federation">U.S. Soccer</a> announced the potential sites for the final, depending on the outcome of the semifinals. It was determined that if Seattle qualified for the final, they would host it at Qwest Field regardless of the opponent. If Chivas USA defeated Sounders FC in the semifinals, they would host the Columbus Crew at <a href="The%20Home%20Depot%20Center">The Home Depot Center</a> in <a href="Carson%2C%20California">Carson, California</a>, or visit <a href="D.C.%20United">D.C. United</a> at <a href="RFK%20Stadium">RFK Stadium</a> in Washington, D.C., depending on the outcome of the other semifinal match. Since Columbus and Seattle advanced from the semifinals, the final was held at Qwest Field in Seattle. This was the first U.S. Open Cup final to be played in the state of Washington.

Columbus general manager Mark McCullers expressed concerns about the fairness of the scheduling since he claimed it would be difficult for the Crew to travel to the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a> on October 5 and then return to Chicago three days later for a league match. Crew head coach <a href="Robert%20Warzycha">Robert Warzycha</a> also complained about the scheduling saying, "You make it to a final, but you have to go to Seattle on Sunday after playing a home game on Saturday... You've got to fly all day, play on the (artificial) <a href="FieldTurf">turf</a> on Tuesday and then you go play an important MLS game in Chicago on Friday. Great."

A year after a <a href="2009%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup%20Final%23Venue%20selection">public argument</a> between Seattle and D.C. United ownership over the fairness of the bidding process to host the <a href="2009%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup%20Final">2009 U.S. Open Cup Final</a>—which D.C. United hosted—Sounders FC was successful in its bid to host the 2010 final. For the 2009 final, D.C. United drew an attendance of 17,329 through extensive marketing efforts. Seattle began selling tickets to the 2010 final on September 7 and within six days 22,000 had already been sold.

In 2010, prior to meeting in the U.S. Open Cup final, Sounders FC and the Crew met twice in MLS league matches. The first was played on May 1 at Qwest Field and finished in a 1–1 draw. 
The second meeting between the two teams was played on September 18, only 17 days before the Open Cup final, at Crew Stadium. Seattle won by a convincing scoreline of 4–0. Regarding the score of the latter meeting, Sounders FC coach Sigi Schmid stated, "I don't think the difference between the two teams is four goals even though that was the score." Discussing the difficulty of going into Seattle for the final, Crew forward Barros Schelotto commented, "The field is for Seattle. The stadium is for Seattle. Everything is for Seattle. But that does not matter. We have the final. We have 90 minutes to win a trophy. Nothing is more important."

In the weeks leading up to the match, Seattle Sounders FC was on a six-game home unbeaten streak. However, in the last match before the final (a league match victory over <a href="Toronto%20FC">Toronto FC</a>) goalkeeper Keller allowed a goal, ending his three-game shutout streak. The Columbus Crew came into the final not having won a league match in the previous month, although their last match was a 0–0 draw with the <a href="San%20Jose%20Earthquakes">San Jose Earthquakes</a> on October 2.

Since MLS teams began participating in the tournament in 1996, the home team had won nine times and lost three in the U.S. Open Cup final prior to 2011. The 2003 Chicago Fire, 2007 <a href="New%20England%20Revolution">New England Revolution</a> and 2009 Seattle Sounders FC were the only away teams to win a final.

The 2010 U.S. Open Cup Final was played on October 5 at Qwest Field in Seattle, Washington. Live television coverage was provided nationally by <a href="Fox%20Soccer%20Channel">Fox Soccer Channel</a>. Prior to kickoff, Seattle's 2009 U.S. Open Cup trophy was displayed at midfield. The final drew an attendance of 31,311 surpassing the 81-year-old record for the event. The previous record attendance for an Open Cup final was 21,583, set in <a href="1929%20National%20Challenge%20Cup">1929</a> when <a href="New%20York%20Hakoah">New York Hakoah</a> defeated the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Madison%20Kennel">Madison Kennel Club of St. Louis</a>.

Both clubs started mostly their first-team players for the final. Costa Rican <a href="Leonardo%20Gonz%C3%A1lez">Leonardo González</a>, a regular starter at <a href="left%20back">left back</a> for Sounders FC, was unavailable due to U.S. Open Cup roster limitations, which allow teams to have only five foreign players on their 18-man, game day roster. Defender <a href="Tyson%20Wahl">Tyson Wahl</a> started in his place. Crew backup goalkeeper <a href="Andy%20Gruenebaum">Andy Gruenebaum</a> also started in place of normal starter <a href="Will%20Hesmer">Will Hesmer</a>, though this was a normal change for U.S. Open Cup and <a href="CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">CONCACAF Champions League</a> matches. Each club was organized in a <a href="Formation%20%28association%20football%29%234%E2%80%934%E2%80%932%20diamond%20or%204%E2%80%931%E2%80%932%E2%80%931%E2%80%932">4–4–2</a> formation at kickoff.

Seattle had most of the early scoring opportunities. Two minutes into the match, Montero took the first shot of the game with a header at close range which was saved by Crew goalkeeper Gruenebaum. Seconds later, Montero had another shot from distance which went just over the bar. Four minutes later, Seattle <a href="midfielder">midfielder</a> Zakuani got around Crew defender Frankie Hejduk and passed the ball to Blaise Nkufo whose tap-in attempt was saved by Gruenbaum. In the 12th minute, Gaven took the Crew's first shot of the match but it flew high over the crossbar. In the 16th minute Zakuani had a run up the middle before passing to Montero, whose shot was again saved by Gruenbaum. Columbus successfully defended crosses from Zakuani and Nkufo in the 18th minute and kept Seattle from getting a shot off. Columbus nearly took the lead in the 20th minute as Emmanuel Ekpo got behind the defense and made a quick pass back to Gaven, who missed a wide-open shot over the bar.

While Seattle controlled the game for much of the first half, Columbus took the lead on a counterattack movement in the 24th minute. The play developed on the right side when Hejduk made a low pass to Lenhart from a forward position. Lenhart touched the ball to Kevin Burns for a low shot inside the far post for a goal. Few chances were created after the goal as Columbus' strong defensive play held off Seattle's attacks. In the 34th minute Tyson Wahl crossed the ball into the box but Gruenbaum was able to jump and grab the ball before Nkufo could direct it towards goal with his head.

Seattle equalized in the 38th minute. Montero passed to Tyson Wahl, who crossed the ball into the <a href="Penalty%20area">18-yard-box</a>, where Crew goalkeeper Gruenebaum hesitated on how to handle the ball. He knocked it away, and it fell to Nathan Sturgis, who passed the ball between the legs of Gaven to find teammate Sanna Nyassi 18 yards out. Nyassi turned on the ball and shot it past Gruenebaum, who was still out of position. Following the goal few scoring opportunities were created before halftime. After one minute of stoppage time, the first half ended with a tie score, 1–1.

Columbus Crew midfielder Kevin Burns commented on the team's attitude after the first half, "We were OK at halftime. Our heads weren't down." No substitutions were made as the teams returned to the field for the second half.

Despite Seattle's continued control of the tempo of gameplay early in the second half, they were unable to create many scoring opportunities. In the 58th minute <a href="James%20Riley%20%28soccer%29">James Riley</a> was alone on the edge of the penalty area after receiving a pass from Montero. However, Riley's cross was deflected for a corner kick. Two minutes later Seattle's Zakuani created a scoring threat when he received an aerial pass into the penalty area, but Crew goalkeeper Gruenebaum was quick to get to the play causing Zakuani to fall down and the ball to bounce away before being cleared by Columbus. In the 64th minute, Kasey Keller made a diving save to stop Gaven's shot from 30 yards out, his fourth <a href="shot%20on%20goal">shot on goal</a> in the game. Two minutes later, the score line finally changed as Seattle completed 18 consecutive passes. Montero got open on the right side of the field to receive the 19th and then crossed a ball into the penalty area. Gruenebaum decided not to chase the pass as Zakuani ran inside of Crew defender Hejduk and headed a shot that hit the crossbar. The Crew defenders failed to clear the ball before Nyassi ran in and easily scored the go-ahead goal.

Zakuani was again on the attack in the 75th minute with a run down the middle, but was "sandwiched" by two Columbus defenders and lost possession. Columbus made two substitutions in the 78th minute, bringing on fresh legs at forward with Rentería in for Lenhart and swapping midfielder Burns out for forward Andrés Mendoza. Shortly after the substitutions, Keller came out to grab a Columbus cross and made a long throw to Montero. Seattle pushed up the field and Montero took a shot which bounced off teammate Nkufo's back. In the 81st minute, Crew coach Warzycha made his final substitution bringing on <a href="Robbie%20Rogers">Robbie Rogers</a> for Gaven. Shortly after, in the 85th minute, Columbus nearly equalized when Rogers received a pass from Hejduk and took a shot which bounced hard off the crossbar.

Seattle made its first substitution in the 79th minute when Sanna Nyassi left the field to an ovation from the crowd as he was replaced by <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Fern%C3%A1ndez">Álvaro Fernández</a>. In the 87th minute, Zakuani ran free on a breakaway but was taken down by Crew forward Barros Schelotto who received a <a href="Yellow%20card%20%28association%20football%29">yellow card</a> for the foul. Montero took the ensuing free kick and shot it on goal with Gruenebaum catching it for the save.

The referee added three minutes of stoppage time to the second half. During that time, Seattle made its remaining two substitutions. First in the 90th minute Roger Levesque was brought on for Zakuani, and then in the 93rd minute they brought on Jaqua for Montero. The referee blew his whistle ending the game shortly thereafter. Most of the fans in attendance remained after the game for the presentation of the trophy.


Sounders FC head coach Sigi Schmid discussed the match in the post-game press conference saying:

Seattle Sounders FC is the first MLS club to repeat as the U.S. Open Cup champion and the first club overall to repeat since the <a href="New%20York%20Pancyprian-Freedoms">New York Pancyprian-Freedoms</a> did so in 1982 and 1983. The victory was also Sigi Schmid's third Open Cup championship as a head coach. Sanna Nyassi was the first player to score multiple goals in an Open Cup final since Mike Deleray in <a href="1994%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">1994</a>. As champions of the tournament, Sounders FC received the $100,000 cash prize while the Columbus Crew received $50,000 as the runner-up. Seattle also earned a berth into the preliminary round of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League</a>.

The 2012 edition of the Tour de France consisted of 22 teams. All eighteen <a href="UCI%20ProTeam">UCI ProTeam</a>s were entitled, and obliged, to enter the race. On 6 April 2012, the organiser of the Tour, <a href="Amaury%20Sport%20Organisation">Amaury Sport Organisation</a> (ASO), announced the four second-tier <a href="List%20of%202012%20UCI%20Professional%20Continental%20and%20Continental%20teams">UCI Professional Continental teams</a> given <a href="wild%20card%20%28sports%29">wildcard</a> invitations, of which three were French-based (, and ) and one was Dutch ().

According to many observers before the race the favourite for the <a href="General%20classification%20in%20the%20Tour%20de%20France">general classification</a> was <a href="Bradley%20Wiggins">Bradley Wiggins</a>. His closest rivals were thought to be <a href="Cadel%20Evans">Cadel Evans</a> () and <a href="Vincenzo%20Nibali">Vincenzo Nibali</a> (). <a href="Alberto%20Contador">Alberto Contador</a>, the winner of both the <a href="2007%20Tour%20de%20France">2007 Tour</a> and <a href="2009%20Tour%20de%20France">2009 Tour</a>, was serving a doping suspension and did not race in the 2012 Tour. <a href="Andy%20Schleck">Andy Schleck</a>, who finished second in the <a href="2010%20Tour%20de%20France">2010 Tour</a> (later promoted to the winner after Contador's result was annulled in February 2012) and <a href="2011%20Tour%20de%20France">2011 Tour</a>, was not able to recover from an injury suffered in the <a href="2012%20Crit%C3%A9rium%20du%20Dauphin%C3%A9">Critérium du Dauphiné</a>. The other riders considered contenders for the general classification were <a href="Ryder%20Hesjedal">Ryder Hesjedal</a> (), <a href="Fr%C3%A4nk%20Schleck">Fränk Schleck</a> (), <a href="Samuel%20S%C3%A1nchez">Samuel Sánchez</a> (), <a href="Jurgen%20Van%20den%20Broeck">Jurgen Van den Broeck</a> (), <a href="Tony%20Martin%20%28cyclist%29">Tony Martin</a> (), <a href="Denis%20Menchov">Denis Menchov</a> (), <a href="Levi%20Leipheimer">Levi Leipheimer</a> (), <a href="Alejandro%20Valverde">Alejandro Valverde</a> () and <a href="Robert%20Gesink">Robert Gesink</a> ().

Prior to the 2012 Tour, Wiggins's highest finishes in a <a href="Grand%20Tour%20%28cycling%29">Grand Tour</a> were third in the <a href="2011%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">2011 Vuelta a España</a> and fourth in the 2009 Tour (later promoted to third after <a href="Lance%20Armstrong">Lance Armstrong</a>'s result was annulled in October 2012). Wiggins had shown his form in the lead-up to the Tour by winning the general classifications in three <a href="stage%20race">stage race</a>s in the 2012 season: the <a href="2012%20Paris%E2%80%93Nice">Paris–Nice</a>, the <a href="2012%20Tour%20de%20Romandie">Tour de Romandie</a> and the Dauphiné. As a <a href="time%20trialist">time trialist</a>, Wiggins was thought to be the rider most suited to the race's course. The 2011 Tour winner Evans came back from an illness earlier in the season to win the two-day <a href="2012%20Crit%C3%A9rium%20International">Critérium International</a> and place third at the Dauphiné. The <a href="2010%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">2010 Vuelta a España</a> winner Nibali had shown his form in the lead-up to the Tour by winning the <a href="2012%20Tirreno%E2%80%93Adriatico">Tirreno–Adriatico</a> stage race.

The <a href="sprinter%20%28cycling%29">sprinters</a> considered favourites for the <a href="Points%20classification%20in%20the%20Tour%20de%20France">points classification</a> and wins in <a href="bunch%20sprint">bunch sprint</a> finishes were <a href="Mark%20Cavendish">Mark Cavendish</a> (), <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Greipel">André Greipel</a> (), <a href="Matthew%20Goss">Matthew Goss</a> (), <a href="Peter%20Sagan">Peter Sagan</a> () and <a href="Marcel%20Kittel">Marcel Kittel</a> (). Cavendish, the <a href="2011%20UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20road%20race">world road race champion</a> and defending points classification winner, did not have the full support of as he did in the 2011 Tour with the team; 's focus was on Wiggins' general classification ambitions. He had won the four-stage race <a href="2012%20Ster%20ZLM%20Toer">Ster ZLM Toer</a> thirteen days before the start of the Tour. Greipel, who had the full backing of his team, had shown his form in the season with thirteen victories up to the Tour. Goss was second to Cavendish at the world championships and was the new sprint leader of his team, although he had only one win in the year up to the Tour. Sagan was equal in wins with Greipel with thirteen, of which five came in the <a href="2012%20Tour%20of%20California">Tour of California</a> and four in the <a href="2012%20Tour%20de%20Suisse">Tour de Suisse</a>. Kittel won two stages in both the <a href="2012%20Tour%20of%20Oman">Tour of Oman</a> and Ster ZLM Toer.

On 29 October 2010, the ASO announced that Liège would host the 2012 edition's opening <a href="race%20stage">race stage</a>s (known as the <a href="List%20of%20Tour%20de%20France%20Grands%20D%C3%A9parts">"Grand Départ"</a>). Further details of the first three stages held in Belgium were released at an event at the city's Prince-Bishops' Palace on 18 November. Liège, which had also hosted the <a href="2004%20Tour%20de%20France">2004</a> "Grand Départ", became the first city outside France to host the "Grand Départ" twice. The entire route of the race was accidentally published on the ASO website on 10 October 2011, eight days before the official presentation at the <a href="Palais%20des%20congr%C3%A8s%20de%20Paris">Palais des Congrès</a> in Paris. At the event, the race director, <a href="Christian%20Prudhomme">Christian Prudhomme</a>, said, "It's a Tour designed to widen the possibilities". The route was noted as being innovative when compared to recent years, with fewer high altitude stage finishes, and more of a focus on medium mountain stages and <a href="individual%20time%20trial">individual time trial</a>s. Due to a clash with the start of the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">Olympics</a> at the end of July, the Tour began a week earlier than usual.

After the opening <a href="prologue%20%28cycling%29">prologue</a> in Liège, stage one left the city with the finish in <a href="Seraing">Seraing</a>. The second stage took place between <a href="Vis%C3%A9">Visé</a> to <a href="Tournai">Tournai</a>. The race then moved into north-west France, with the third stage ending in the coastal city of <a href="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne-sur-Mer</a>, before the fourth ended in <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a>, and the fifth in <a href="Saint-Quentin%2C%20Aisne">Saint-Quentin</a>. Stage six took the race east, with the seventh ending in the <a href="Vosges">Vosges</a> Mountains. Stage eight then entered the <a href="Jura%20Mountains">Jura Mountains</a>, with the finish in <a href="Porrentruy">Porrentruy</a>, Switzerland. A return to France saw the next stage take place between <a href="Arc-et-Senans">Arc-et-Senans</a> to <a href="Besan%C3%A7on">Besançon</a>. The next stages, ten and eleven, went into the <a href="Alps">Alps</a>, and stages twelve and thirteen took the Tour down to the Mediterranean coast at <a href="Cap%20d%27Agde">Cap d'Agde</a>. Stage fourteen moved the race into the east of <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>, before a transitional stage taking it to the western side of the mountains for the next two stages. Stage eighteen was held between <a href="Blagnac">Blagnac</a> to <a href="Brive-la-Gaillarde">Brive-la-Gaillarde</a> in the south of the country, before a long transfer took the race back to the north-east for two further stages, with the finish on the <a href="Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es%20stage%20in%20the%20Tour%20de%20France">Champs-Élysées</a> in Paris.

There were 21 stages in the race, covering a total distance of , shorter than the 2011 Tour. The longest <a href="Mass%20start">mass-start</a> stage was the twelfth at , and stage 21 was the shortest at . The race featured twice the time trialling distance of the previous Tour, a total of , with the prologue, stage nine and stage nineteen. Of the remaining stages, nine were officially classified as flat, four as medium mountain and five as high mountain. There were three summit finishes: stage 7, to <a href="La%20Planche%20des%20Belles%20Filles">La Planche des Belles Filles</a>; stage 11, to <a href="La%20Toussuire">La Toussuire</a>-<a href="Les%20Sybelles">Les Sybelles</a>; and stage 17, to <a href="Peyragudes">Peyragudes</a>. The <a href="Col%20du%20Grand%20Colombier">Col du Grand Colombier</a>, in the Alps, was included for the first time, and was among six "<a href="hors%20cat%C3%A9gorie">hors catégorie</a>" (English: beyond category) rated climbs in the race. The highest point of the race was the -high <a href="Col%20du%20Tourmalet">Col du Tourmalet</a> mountain pass on stage sixteen. There were nine new stage start or finish locations. The rest days were after stage nine, in <a href="M%C3%A2con">Mâcon</a>, and fifteen, in <a href="Pau%2C%20Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Atlantiques">Pau</a>.

The opening prologue stage in Liège was won by 's <a href="Fabian%20Cancellara">Fabian Cancellara</a>. Bradley Wiggins and <a href="Sylvain%20Chavanel">Sylvain Chavanel</a> () placed second and third respectively, both seven seconds in arrears, with Wiggins fractionally faster. Cancellara claimed the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification and the green jersey as leader of the points classification. In stage one, a large group of riders reached the final climb, the Côte de Seraing. Cancellara <a href="Attack%20%28cycling%29">attacked</a> from the finish, followed by Peter Sagan and <a href="Edvald%20Boasson%20Hagen">Edvald Boasson Hagen</a> (), before Sagan won the three-man sprint finish at the summit. <a href="Michael%20M%C3%B8rk%C3%B8v">Michael Mørkøv</a> of took the first <a href="polka%20dot">polka dot</a> jersey as leader of the <a href="Mountains%20classification%20in%20the%20Tour%20de%20France">mountains classification</a>. The next stage was won by Mark Cavendish from a bunch sprint finish in Tournai, Belgium, with Sagan taking the green jersey. Stage three, the first in France, saw Sagan win again, crossing the finish line with a comfortable margin on the short steep climb in Boulogne-sur-Mer. The fourth stage ended with a bunch sprint which was won by André Greipel. A crash with remaining took Cavendish out of contention for the stage win. Another bunch finish occurred on the next stage, with Greipel victorious again. The sixth stage was won by Sagan in another bunch sprint.

In stage seven, the first at altitude, the last of the day's <a href="breakaway%20%28cycling%29">breakaway</a> riders were caught with remaining, on the final climb to La Planche des Belles Filles. A select group of five – Wiggins and his compatriot and teammate <a href="Chris%20Froome">Chris Froome</a>, Cadel Evans, Vincenzo Nibali and <a href="Rein%20Taaram%C3%A4e">Rein Taaramäe</a> () – then pulled clear in the final kilometre. Evans attacked before Froome countered and went on to win the stage and take the polka dot jersey. Cancellara lost almost two minutes on the day and surrendered the yellow jersey to Wiggins, who became the fifth <a href="List%20of%20British%20cyclists%20who%20have%20led%20the%20Tour%20de%20France%20general%20classification">British rider to wear the jersey</a>. The eighth stage saw breakaway rider Thibaut Pinot attack a reduced break on the final climb, the <a href="Col%20de%20la%20Croix%20%28Jura%29">Col de la Croix</a>, and solo to the finish in Porrentruy, Switzerland, taking the victory by margin of 26 seconds. Breakaway rider <a href="Fredrik%20Kessiakoff">Fredrik Kessiakoff</a> () took the polka dot jersey. Stage nine's individual time trial was won by Wiggins, with Froome 35 seconds down in second and Cancellara a further 22 seconds behind in third. Froome moved up to third overall. The next day was the first rest day of the Tour.
The tenth stage was the first classified as mountainous. The Col du Grand Colombier broke apart a 25-rider breakaway, leaving a small group to contest the finish at <a href="Bellegarde-sur-Valserine">Bellegarde-sur-Valserine</a>; <a href="Thomas%20Voeckler">Thomas Voeckler</a> () claimed the stage win and the polka dot jersey. Another mountain stage followed the next day, which again saw a large breakaway. The break crossed the two "hors catégorie" climbs – the <a href="Col%20de%20la%20Madeleine">Col de la Madeleine</a> and the <a href="Col%20de%20la%20Croix%20de%20Fer">Col de la Croix de Fer</a> – before being caught by the chasing group, which contained the overall contenders. A number of attacks followed, until 's <a href="Pierre%20Rolland%20%28cyclist%29">Pierre Rolland</a> escaped with to go and took the win at the Les Sybelles ski resort. The group of overall contenders followed 55 seconds later. Evans was not in the leading contenders group and, due to the time lost, he dropped from second to fourth overall, over three minutes in arrears. Kessiakoff took back the lead of the mountains classification. In stage twelve, a large breakaway formed in, before later reducing to five riders across the <a href="Col%20du%20Granier">Col du Granier</a>. They stayed together until the finish, where, with a kilometer remaining, <a href="David%20Millar">David Millar</a> () escaped to take victory, closely followed by <a href="Jean-Christophe%20P%C3%A9raud">Jean-Christophe Péraud</a> (). The next stage finished with a bunch sprint won by Greipel, with Sagan second.

In the first stage in the Pyrenees, the fourteenth stage overall, a large breakaway escaped in, and at one point amassed a lead of fifteen minutes. Of the five remaining riders from the final climb of <a href="Mur%20de%20P%C3%A9gu%C3%A8re">Mur de Péguère</a>, <a href="Luis%20Le%C3%B3n%20S%C3%A1nchez">Luis León Sánchez</a> of attacked on an ascent with remaining and soloed to the finish in <a href="Foix">Foix</a>. As the <a href="peloton">peloton</a> (the main group) passed the Mur de Péguère, a large number of riders suffered tyre punctures; it was later discovered that the race course had been sabotaged with carpet tacks. Evans waited over a minute to get a replacement wheel, then had a further two punctures on the descent. As an act of sportsmanship Wiggins then forced the peloton to wait for Evans to return to the group. The next stage ran through the foothills of the Pyrenees. A five-rider breakaway made it to the finish in Pau, where with to go, <a href="Christian%20Vande%20Velde">Christian Vande Velde</a> () and <a href="Pierrick%20F%C3%A9drigo">Pierrick Fédrigo</a> () escaped with Fédrigo winning the sprint finish between the two cyclists. The following day was the Tour's second rest day.
In the sixteenth stage, the race entered the high mountains with the <a href="queen%20stage">queen stage</a> crossing two "hors catégorie" climbs – the <a href="Col%20d%27Aubisque">Col d'Aubisque</a> and the Col du Tourmalet – followed by the first-category climbs of the <a href="Col%20d%27Aspin">Col d'Aspin</a> and the <a href="Col%20de%20Peyresourde">Col de Peyresourde</a>, completing the so-called "<a href="Circle%20of%20Death%20%28cycling%29">Circle of Death</a>". A 38-rider breakaway crossed the Aubisque, before fracturing on the Tourmalet. Voeckler attacked on the Peyresourde and took the stage win with a margin of one minute and forty seconds. Voeckler's stage victory and maximum points over all summits put him in the lead of the mountains classification. Wiggins, Froome and Nibali came in seven minutes after Voeckler, while Evans lost almost five minutes to the trio, falling from fourth to seventh in the general classification. In the final stage in the Pyrenees, the seventeenth, after a number of attacks on the leading group containing the overall contenders, Alejandro Valverde moved clear over the "hors categorie" Port de Balès. He held his lead to the summit finish at the Peyragudes ski resort. In the group behind, Wiggins and Froome attacked their rivals to finish nineteen seconds later. Nibali came in seventh, a further eighteen seconds down. In the following stage, six riders from a breakaway were caught on the finishing straight in Brive-la-Gaillarde by the head of the chasing peloton, with Cavendish taking the victory ahead of Matthew Goss and Sagan respectively. Wiggins secured the general classification in the penultimate stage's individual time trial. Froome placed second, one minute and sixteen seconds in arrears, with Sánchez a further 34 seconds behind in third.

In the final stage, Cavendish won his fourth consecutive Champs-Élysées stage, to record his third stage win of the race. Wiggins finished the race to become the first British rider to win the Tour de France. Wiggins finished 3 min 21 s clear of compatriot and teammate Froome. Nibali placed third at 6 min 19 s behind Wiggins. Sagan won the points classification with a total of 421, 141 ahead of Greipel in second. Voeckler won the mountains classification with 135 points, 12 ahead of second-placed Kessiakoff. The <a href="Young%20rider%20classification%20in%20the%20Tour%20de%20France">best young rider</a> was rider <a href="Tejay%20van%20Garderen">Tejay van Garderen</a>, who was followed by Pinot and <a href="Steven%20Kruijswijk">Steven Kruijswijk</a> () in second and third respectively. finished as the winners of the <a href="Team%20classification%20in%20the%20Tour%20de%20France">team classification</a>, over 5 min 46 s ahead of second-placed .

During the race's first rest day, the team hotel of the squad, in <a href="Bourg-en-Bresse">Bourg-en-Bresse</a>, was searched by <a href="National%20Police%20%28France%29">French police</a> and <a href="National%20Gendarmerie">gendarmerie</a>. One of the team's riders in the Tour, <a href="R%C3%A9my%20Di%20Gregorio">Rémy Di Gregorio</a>, was arrested in relation to an ongoing anti-doping case, and was immediately suspended by the French team, although the case had been open since 2011, when Di Gregorio was a member of the team. The second rest day was marked by a positive drugs test by Fränk Schleck, the third-placed rider from the 2011 Tour. Schleck was withdrawn from the race by his team after traces of <a href="xipamide">xipamide</a>, a banned sulfonamide diuretic drug, were found in the A-sample of his urine; the presence of xipamide was later confirmed by the B-sample. Subsequently, in January 2013, he was given a one-year ban by the Luxembourg Anti-Doping Agency. In July 2014, Denis Menchov was retroactively disqualified from the race by cycling's governing body, "<a href="Union%20Cycliste%20Internationale">Union Cycliste Internationale</a>", for "abnormalities in his <a href="biological%20passport">biological passport</a>".

There were four main individual classifications contested in the 2012 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. There were no time bonuses given at the end of stages for this edition of the Tour. If a crash had happened within the final of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.
The second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing in the top fifteen positions in a stage finish, or in <a href="intermediate%20sprint">intermediate sprint</a>s during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. The flat stage finishes awarded a maximum of 45 points, the medium mountain stages awarded a maximum of 30 points, and the high mountain stages, time trials and intermediate sprints awarded a maximum of 20 points. The leader was identified by a green jersey.

The third classification was the mountains classification. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and "hors catégorie", with the more difficult climbs rated lower. Fourth-category awarded 1 rider with 1 point; third-category awarded 2 riders, the first with 2 points; second-category awarded 4 riders, the first with 5 points; and first-category awarded 6 riders, the first with 10 points; and "hors catégorie" awarded ten riders, the first with 25 points. Double points were awarded on the summit finishes on stages 1, 11 and 20. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.

The final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1987. The leader wore a white jersey.

The final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie. The riders in the team that lead this classification were identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys and, for first the time in the Tour's history, wore yellow <a href="bicycle%20helmet">helmets</a>.

In addition, there was a <a href="Combativity%20award%20in%20the%20Tour%20de%20France">combativity award</a> given after each stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have "made the greatest effort and who has demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship". No combativity awards were given for the prologue, the time trials and the final stage. The winner wore a red number bib the following stage. At the conclusion of the Tour, <a href="Chris%20Anker%20S%C3%B8rensen">Chris Anker Sørensen</a> () won the overall super-combativity award, again, decided by a jury.

A total of €2,414,246 was awarded in cash prizes in the race. The overall winner of the general classification received €450,000, with the second and third placed riders getting €200,000 and €100,000 respectively. All finishers of the race were awarded money. The holders of the classifications benefited on each stage they led; the final winners of the points and mountains classifications were given €25,000, while the best young rider and most combative rider got €20,000. The team classification winners were given €50,000. There were also two special awards each with a prize of €5,000, the <a href="Souvenir%20Henri%20Desgrange">Souvenir Henri Desgrange</a>, given to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col de la Croix de Fer in stage eleven, and the <a href="Souvenir%20Jacques%20Goddet">Souvenir Jacques Goddet</a>, given to the first rider to pass <a href="Jacques%20Goddet">Goddet</a>'s memorial at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet in stage sixteen. Pierre Rolland won the Henri Desgrange and Thomas Voeckler won the Jacques Goddet.

The race was the 18th of the 29 events in the <a href="2012%20UCI%20World%20Tour">UCI World Tour</a>, with riders from the ProTeams competing individually for points that contributed towards the rankings. Points were awarded to the top twenty finishers in the general classification and to the top five finishers in each stage. Wiggins moved into the lead of the individual ranking, with <a href="Joaquim%20Rodr%C3%ADguez">Joaquim Rodríguez</a> dropping to second. The points accrued by Chris Froome moved him from 52nd to 6th. retained their lead in the team ranking, ahead of second-place . Spain remained as the leaders of the nations ranking, with Italy second.

Miniopterus aelleni

Miniopterus aelleni is a <a href="bat">bat</a> in the genus "<a href="Miniopterus">Miniopterus</a>" that occurs on <a href="Anjouan">Anjouan</a> in the <a href="Comoros">Comoros</a> and in northern and western <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>.

It is a small brown bat; its forearm length is . The long <a href="Tragus%20%28ear%29">tragus</a> (a projection in the outer ear) has a broad base and a blunt or rounded tip. The <a href="uropatagium">uropatagium</a> (tail membrane) is sparsely haired. The <a href="palate">palate</a> is flat, and there are distinct <a href="diastema%20%28dentistry%29">diastemata</a> (gaps) between the upper <a href="canine%20%28tooth%29">canines</a> and <a href="premolar">premolar</a>s.

Populations of this species have historically been included in "<a href="Miniopterus%20manavi">Miniopterus manavi</a>", but evidence published in 2008 and 2009 indicates that "M. manavi" is a complex of five separate species, including the newly described "M. aelleni". "M. aelleni" has been found in forests and caves in <a href="karst%20topography">karstic</a> areas. Its distribution overlaps that of "<a href="Miniopterus%20griveaudi">M. griveaudi</a>", also formerly included in "M. manavi".

In a 1995 contribution to "<a href="Faune%20de%20Madagascar">Faune de Madagascar</a>" on Malagasy bats, <a href="Randolph%20Peterson">Randolph Peterson</a> and colleagues listed four species of "<a href="Miniopterus">Miniopterus</a>" on Madagascar and the nearby <a href="Comoros">Comoros</a>, including the small "<a href="Miniopterus%20manavi">Miniopterus manavi</a>" with a broad distribution on both Madagascar and the Comoros. However, during the first decade of the 21st century, <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular studies</a> have revealed that "Miniopterus", a widespread genus in the Old World, is much more species-rich than previously thought. A 2008 study comparing sequences of the <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial</a> <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome "b"</a> and <a href="D-loop">D-loop</a> markers found two distinct, unrelated groups within the supposed "M. manavi" from the Comoros; both groups were also found on Madagascar. The next year, <a href="Steven%20Goodman">Steven Goodman</a> and colleagues revisited the group with more extensive sampling on Madagascar. They separated three species within the former ""M. manavi"": "M. manavi" itself in the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Madagascar%29">Central Highlands</a>, "<a href="Miniopterus%20griveaudi">M. griveaudi</a>" (previously a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of "M. manavi") on <a href="Anjouan">Anjouan</a>, <a href="Grande%20Comore">Grande Comore</a>, and northern and western Madagascar, and the newly described "Miniopterus aelleni" on Anjouan and northern and western Madagascar. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "aelleni" honors Prof. <a href="Villy%20Aellen">Villy Aellen</a> of the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%20of%20Geneva">Natural History Museum of Geneva</a>, who has done much research on African bats. Within "M. aelleni", Goodman and colleagues found some differentiation (3.4% sequence divergence in cytochrome "b" sequences) between individuals from <a href="Montagne%20d%27Ambre">Montagne d'Ambre</a> in northern Madagascar and those from Anjouan and <a href="Ankarana">Ankarana</a>, near Montagne d'Ambre; the cytochrome "b" divergence between "M. aelleni" and other Malagasy "Miniopterus" is 7 to 10%.

Later in 2009, Goodman and colleagues described two more species of "M. manavi"-like Malagasy "Miniopterus": "<a href="Miniopterus%20brachytragos">M. brachytragos</a>" from northern Madagascar and "<a href="Miniopterus%20mahafaliensis">M. mahafaliensis</a>" from the southwest. On the basis of cytochrome "b" sequences, they found that "M. aelleni" was most closely related to a <a href="clade">clade</a> of "M. brachytragos", "M. manavi", and another recently described Malagasy species, "<a href="Miniopterus%20petersoni">M. petersoni</a>". The five recognized species of "M. manavi"-like bats are not each other's closest relatives, but apparently acquired their similarities through <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>. At some places (for example, <a href="Tsingy%20de%20Namoroka%20Strict%20Nature%20Reserve">Namoroka</a>) four <a href="cryptic%20species">cryptic species</a> of "M. manavi"-like bats, including "M. aelleni", occur together.

"Miniopterus aelleni" is a small, brown "Miniopterus" species. The head may be slightly lighter in color than the body. Some hairs on the underparts have buff tips. "Miniopterus griveaudi" is similar in color, but "M. manavi" is darker and "M. brachytragos" and "M. mahafaliensis" are lighter. The <a href="Tragus%20%28ear%29">tragus</a> (a projection on the inner side of the outer ear) is long and has a broad base with a crest at the side, and ends in a blunt to slightly rounded tip. In "M. manavi" and "M. griveaudi", in contrast, the base is narrower, in "M. mahafaliensis", the sides of the tragus are parallel, and "M. brachytragus" has a short, blunt tragus sparsely covered with hair. The wing membrane is also brown, but the <a href="uropatagium">uropatagium</a> is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is sparsely covered with thin, but clearly visible hairs. In contrast, "M. manavi", "M. mahafaliensis", and "M. brachytragos" have densely covered uropatagia and that of "M. griveaudi" is almost naked. Individuals from Anjouan have significantly shorter hindfeet than those from Madagascar, but otherwise the two populations cannot be distinguished on the basis of external characteristics.

In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is short and line-shaped, but longer than in other "manavi"-like species. The central groove in the <a href="nasal%20depression">nasal depression</a> is relatively narrow. The <a href="frontal%20bone">frontal bone</a>s are rounded and bear a well-developed <a href="sagittal%20crest">sagittal crest</a>. Further back on the braincase, the <a href="lambdoid%20crest">lambdoid crest</a> is also prominent. The middle part of the <a href="palate">palate</a> is flat, as in "M. manavi" but unlike in "M. brachytragos", "M. griveaudi", and "M. mahafaliensis", which have a curved palate. At the palate's back margin is a long, thin <a href="posterior%20palatal%20spine">posterior palatal spine</a>. "Miniopterus aelleni" has 36 teeth in the <a href="dental%20formula">dental formula</a> (two <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s, one <a href="canine%20%28tooth%29">canine</a>, two <a href="premolar">premolar</a>s, and three <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a> in both upper toothrows and three incisors, one canine, three premolars, and three molars in the lower toothrows). As is characteristic of "Miniopterus", the first upper premolar (P2; P1 and P3 are missing) is smaller and more simplified than the second (P4). There are clear <a href="diastema%20%28dentistry%29">diastemata</a> (gaps) between the upper canine (C1) and P2 and between P2 and P4, which are weaker or absent in "M. griveaudi" and "M. manavi". Behind C1, the toothrows are about parallel, not divergent as in "M. manavi". The third upper molar (M3) is more compressed than in "M. manavi" and "M. griveaudi". In some measurements of the skull and teeth, Anjouan specimens are larger than those from Madagascar.

The animal has a <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a> of 46 <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s, with a total of 50 major arms on the <a href="autosome">autosome</a>s (non-sex chromosomes). The karyotype is conserved among species of "Miniopterus"; the number of chromosomes and arms is identical in "M. aelleni", the Malagasy "M. griveaudi" and "<a href="Miniopterus%20gleni">M. gleni</a>", and even the Asian "<a href="Miniopterus%20fuliginosus">M. fuliginosus</a>".

"Miniopterus aelleni" is known to live from above sea level in northern and western Madagascar, at on Montagne d'Ambre, northern Madagascar, and from on Anjouan in the nearby Comoros. On Madagascar, it has been recorded in forest and caves in <a href="karst%20topography">karst</a> areas; its distribution broadly overlaps that of "M. griveaudi" and the two have been found in the same roost sites on several occasions. On Anjouan, "M. aelleni" is less common than "M. griveaudi"; there, it is known from four specimens only, all collected in 2006. These come from two nearby sites: a rocky area near a river and a disturbed forest. These animals, collected in late November, were in reproductive condition, with two females pregnant and a third <a href="lactating">lactating</a>. "M. griveaudi" were reproductively active at the same time, suggesting that the reproductive seasons of the two do not differ significantly. Although some ecological and behavioral data has been published on "Miniopterus manavi", the recognition of several cryptic species within this group, more than one of which may occur in any given locality, renders the association of these data with any of the individual species uncertain; however, species of "Miniopterus" generally feed on insects. Because "M. aelleni" is widespread and occurs in many <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a>s on Madagascar, Goodman and colleagues inferred that its <a href="conservation%20status">conservation status</a> is secure.

Requiem (Reger)

<a href="Max%20Reger">Max Reger</a>'s 1915 Requiem (or the Hebbel Requiem), , is a <a href="20th-century%20classical%20music%23Romantic%20style">late Romantic</a> setting of <a href="Christian%20Friedrich%20Hebbel">Friedrich Hebbel's</a> poem "Requiem" for <a href="alto">alto</a> or <a href="baritone">baritone</a> solo, chorus and orchestra. It is Reger's last completed work for chorus and orchestra, dedicated in the <a href="autograph">autograph</a> as " (To the memory of the German heroes who fell in <a href="World%20War%20I">the 1914/15 War</a>).

Reger had composed Requiem settings before: his 1912 <a href="motet">motet</a> for <a href="M%C3%A4nnerchor">male chorus</a>, published as the final part of his , uses the same poem, and in 1914 he set out to compose a choral work in memory of the <a href="World%20War%20I%20casualties">victims of the Great War</a>. The setting is of the Latin <a href="Requiem">Requiem</a>, the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> service for the dead, but the work remained a fragment and was eventually designated the " (<a href="%23Latin%20Requiem">Latin Requiem</a>), .

The "Hebbel Requiem" was published by <a href="Fritz%20Simrock">N. Simrock</a> in 1916, after the composer's death, with another choral composition, ' ("The Hermit"), , to a poem by <a href="Joseph%20Freiherr%20von%20Eichendorff">Joseph von Eichendorff</a>. That publication was titled ' (Two songs for mixed chorus with orchestra), . Reger provided a piano <a href="Transcription%20%28music%29">transcription</a> of the orchestral parts. <a href="Max%20Becksch%C3%A4fer">Max Beckschäfer</a> arranged the work for voice, chorus and organ in 1985. The "Hebbel Requiem" was first performed in Heidelberg on 16July 1916 as part of a memorial concert for Reger, conducted by <a href="Philipp%20Wolfrum">Philipp Wolfrum</a>.

Reger thought the "Hebbel Requiem" was "among the most beautiful things" he ever wrote. It has been described as of "lyrical beauty, a dramatic compactness, and [of] economy of musical means" in which the composer's "mastery of impulse, technique, and material is apparent".
Reger was a German composer, born in <a href="Brand%2C%20Bavaria">Brand</a> in 1873 and raised in <a href="Weiden%20in%20der%20Oberpfalz">Weiden in der Oberpfalz</a>. He studied <a href="music%20theory">music theory</a> from April to July 1890 with <a href="Hugo%20Riemann">Hugo Riemann</a> at the royal conservatory in <a href="Sondershausen">Sondershausen</a> and continued his studies, in piano and theory, at the <a href="Wiesbaden">Wiesbaden</a> Conservatory beginning in September of that year. He established himself as a keyboard composer, performer, and teacher of piano and organ. The <a href="Max%20Reger%20works%23Table%20of%20compositions">first compositions</a> to which he assigned <a href="opus%20number">opus number</a>s were <a href="chamber%20music">chamber music</a>. In 1891 he composed his <a href="Sechs%20Lieder%2C%20Op.%204">"Sechs Lieder", Op. 4</a>, a collection of six songs. The first, "" (Prayer), was on a text by <a href="Christian%20Friedrich%20Hebbel">Friedrich Hebbel</a>, who also wrote the poem on which two of Reger's Requiem settings are based.

Reger returned to his parental home in 1898, where he composed his first work for choir and orchestra, "" (Hymn to song), <a href="Max%20Reger%20works%2321">Op. 21</a>. He moved to <a href="Munich">Munich</a> in 1901. Income from publishers, concerts and private teaching enabled him to marry in 1902. His wife, Elsa vonBercken, was a <a href="divorce">divorce</a>d <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a>, and as a result he was <a href="Excommunication">excommunicated</a> from the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>. In 1907 he was appointed musical director at <a href="Leipzig%20University">Leipzig University</a> and professor at the Royal Conservatory in Leipzig.
In 1911 Reger was appointed "<a href="Kapellmeister%23Similar%20terms%20and%20equivalents">Hofkapellmeister</a>" (music director) at the court of Duke <a href="Georg%20II%20of%20Saxe-Meiningen">Georg II of Saxe-Meiningen</a>, while retaining his professorial duties at the Leipzig conservatory. In 1912 he set Hebbel's poem "Requiem" as a <a href="motet">motet</a> for unaccompanied male choir, which was published as No.10 of his collection <a href="Max%20Reger%20works%2383">Op. 83</a>. In 1913 he composed four <a href="tone%20poem">tone poem</a>s on paintings by <a href="Arnold%20B%C3%B6cklin">Arnold Böcklin</a> ("<a href="Vier%20Tondichtungen%20nach%20A.%20B%C3%B6cklin">Vier Tondichtungen nach A. Böcklin</a>"), including the painting "Die Toteninsel" ("<a href="Isle%20of%20the%20Dead%20%28painting%29">"Isle of the Dead"</a>"), as his <a href="Max%20Reger%20works%23128">Op. 128</a>. He gave up the court position in 1914 for health reasons. That year, in response to the World War, he set out to compose a choral work to commemorate the soldiers who had died or were mortally wounded. He began to set the Latin <a href="Requiem">Requiem</a> but abandoned the work as a fragment. In 1915 he moved to <a href="Jena">Jena</a> but continued teaching in Leipzig. In Jena, he composed the "Hebbel Requiem" for soloist, choir and orchestra, Op.144b, again on Hebbel's poem, as in the setting for men's chorus. Following a full day of teaching in Leipzig, Reger died of a heart attack while staying at a hotel there on 11May 1916.

In 1840 the <a href="playwright">playwright</a> Friedrich Hebbel wrote a poem in German titled "Requiem", its <a href="Latin">Latin</a> title alluding to "" (eternal rest), the first words of the <a href="Requiem%23Introit">Mass for the Dead</a>. The poem opens with an <a href="Apostrophe%20%28figure%20of%20speech%29">apostrophe</a> to a "soul" in a plea, "" (Soul, forget them not, soul, forget not the dead). These words appear to echo various <a href="psalms">psalms</a>, such as , "Bless the Lord, O my soul". Hebbel, however, evokes an "eternal rest" that is distinctly non-religious: the poem offers no <a href="Metaphysics">metaphysical</a> reference, <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> or otherwise, but calls for remembrance as the only way to keep the dead alive. The first lines, in which the speaker calls upon the soul not to forget the dead, are repeated in the centre of the poem and again at its conclusion, as a refrain that sets apart two longer sections of verse. The first of these sections describes how the dead, nurtured by love, enjoy a final glow of life. In contrast, the latter section portrays a different fate for souls that have been forsaken: who are relegated to an unending, desolate struggle for renewed existence. The musicologist Katherine FitzGibbon notes that the speaker of this narrative is not identified, but may be "a poetic narrator, divine voice, or even the dead".

The poem was published in 1857. Separately, <a href="Peter%20Cornelius">Peter Cornelius</a> set the same poem in 1863, as a funeral motet for a six-part chorus, in response to the author's death.

Reger composed his first setting of Hebbel's poem as a motet for unaccompanied male choir in 1912 in <a href="Meiningen">Meiningen</a>, where he had worked from 1911. He composed it for the Basler Liedertafel, conducted by <a href="Hermann%20Suter">Hermann Suter</a>, who performed it on 18May 1912 to celebrate their 60th anniversary before giving the official premiere at the national "Schweizer Eidgenössisches Sängerfest" (Swiss federal song festival) in <a href="Neuch%C3%A2tel">Neuchâtel</a> on 22July 1912.

In accordance with the poem's structure, Reger used the same material for each of the refrains, in a <a href="Homophony">homophonic</a> setting. The words "ihr verglimmendes Leben" ("their dimming life") are illustrated by "a sequence of chromatically descending sixth chords". Similar descending chords are often found in Reger's works as a musical expression of "pain, fear, death, and suffering—common associations with chromaticism since the sixteenth century", according to FitzGibbon. Both the recurring refrain and the descending chords reappear in the later setting of the poem in the "Hebbel Requiem".

The motet was published under the title "Requiem" as the closing part of "" (Ten songs for men's chorus), , with earlier compositions from 1904.

After the outbreak of war, Reger intended to compose a work commemorating the soldiers who had died or were mortally wounded, a choral work of "" (in great style). By the autumn of 1914, he was in discussion with a theologian in <a href="Giessen">Giessen</a> about a composition, tentatively titled "" Last Things [Final Judgment and Resurrection])". The organist <a href="Karl%20Straube">Karl Straube</a>, who had premiered several of Reger's organ works, recommended that Reger compose the traditional Latin Requiem instead, because "" would only be a variation on "<a href="A%20German%20Requiem%20%28Brahms%29">Ein deutsches Requiem</a>" by <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Johannes Brahms</a>. Following his advice, Reger managed the composition of the <a href="Music%20for%20the%20Requiem%20Mass%23Introit">introit</a> and <a href="Music%20for%20the%20Requiem%20Mass%23Kyrie%20eleison">Kyrie</a>, combining both texts into one movement. He announced the project, a composition for soloists, chorus, orchestra and organ, to his publisher on 3October 1914. The "<a href="Music%20for%20the%20Requiem%20Mass%23Sequence">Dies irae</a>" remained unfinished. Reger wrote to <a href="Fritz%20Stein">Fritz Stein</a>, his friend and later biographer, that he was in the middle of its composition, but had been interrupted after the line "statuens in parte dextra".

The "Lateinisches Requiem" is scored for soloists (<a href="soprano">soprano</a>, <a href="alto">alto</a>, <a href="tenor">tenor</a>, <a href="Bass%20%28voice%20type%29">bass</a>), a four-part (<a href="SATB">SATB</a>) choir, three flutes (also piccolo), two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, three percussionists and strings. It is Reger's only choral composition to use four soloists. The four "" are used like the several choirs in compositions by <a href="Heinrich%20Sch%C3%BCtz">Heinrich Schütz</a>. The first movement opens with a long organ <a href="pedal%20point">pedal point</a>, which has been compared to the beginning of Wagner's "<a href="Das%20Rheingold">Das Rheingold</a>" and the Brahms "Requiem".

The work remained unfinished at Reger's death, and his publisher named the first movement the ', . The music was first performed by Stein in Berlin on 28May 1938 with four soloists and the enlarged choir of the <a href="Hochschule%20f%C3%BCr%20Musik%20Berlin">Musikhochschule Berlin</a>. For this performance, the liturgical Latin text was replaced by a German text, adapted to suit <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> ideology. Hellmut von Hase titled his text ' (Rite of the Dead) and managed to serve "the Nazi adulation of the fallen war hero" (as FitzGibbon said), dropping references to the bible. He replaced for example "" (Hear my prayer; to you shall all flesh come) by "In sorrow we mutely lower the flags, for into the grave sunk what was dear to us." This version was published in 1939 by the Max Reger Society.

The unfinished "Dies irae" was published in 1974 and first performed in Hamburg's <a href="St.%20James%27%20Church%2C%20Hamburg">St. Jakobi</a> on 3November 1979 by <a href="Yoko%20Kawahara">Yoko Kawahara</a>, <a href="Marga%20H%C3%B6ffgen">Marga Höffgen</a>, <a href="Hans-Dieter%20Bader">Hans-Dieter Bader</a>, <a href="Nikolaus%20Hillebrand">Nikolaus Hillebrand</a>, the <a href="NDR%20Chor">NDR Chor</a> and <a href="NDR%20Sinfonieorchester">NDR Sinfonieorchester</a>, conducted by <a href="Roland%20Bader">Roland Bader</a>.

The "Lateinisches Requiem" is officially catalogued as WoOV/9.

Johannes Brahms, in his ' (<a href="A%20German%20Requiem%20%28Brahms%29">A German Requiem</a>), had already opened the way for the composition of a non-<a href="Liturgical%20music">liturgical</a> "Requiem", written in a language other than Latin while still addressing the traditional theme of rest ("requies") for the dead. In this tradition, Reger's 1915 "Requiem", , is also not a setting of the Requiem in Latin, but of Hebbel's poem. He composed it in Jena, a year before his own death, this time for a solo voice (alto or baritone), chorus and orchestra. The "Requiem", , was combined with ' (The Hermit), , a setting of a poem by <a href="Joseph%20Freiherr%20von%20Eichendorff">Joseph von Eichendorff</a>, as "" (Two songs for mixed chorus with orchestra), . Reger titled the autograph of the piano version: 
" / Requiem / (Hebbel)", and he wrote the dedication: "." (To the memory of the German heroes who fell in the War 1914/15).
Reger completed the composition on 25August 1915. He wrote to the publisher on : "I've finished two choral works ("Der Einsiedler" and "Requiem"). I think I can safely say that they're both among the most beautiful things I've ever written." ("Ich habe nun zwei Chorwerke (Der Einsiedler und Requiem) fertig. Ich glaube sagen zu dürfen, daß diese beiden Chorwerke mit das Schönste sind, was ich je geschrieben habe.") "Requiem" was first published by in 1916, edited by Ulrich Haverkampf, with the dedication "Dem Andenken der im großen Kriege gefallenen deutschen Helden" (To the memory of the German heroes who fell in the Great War). Simrock also published a vocal score as prepared by Reger himself.

The "Hebbel Requiem" was first performed, together with "Der Einsiedler", in Heidelberg on 16July 1916, after the composer's death, as part of a memorial concert for Reger, featuring Eva Katharina Lissmann, the choirs Bachverein and Akademischer Gesangverein, and the enlarged Städtisches Orchester (Municipal Orchestra), conducted by <a href="Philipp%20Wolfrum">Philipp Wolfrum</a>.

In 1925 the "Requiem" was published in Vienna as a pocket score, "Philharmonia-Taschenpartitur" No.284. <a href="Edition%20Peters">Edition Peters</a> published it in 1928, stating the performance duration as 25minutes, although the duration implied by the metronome marking is 14minutes.

Reger's "Hebbel Requiem" is in one movement. It follows the overall form of the narrated poem, but with variations, resulting in a structure of different moods. The beginning is recalled in the middle and at the end. The following table is based on the score and on an analysis by Katherine FitzGibbon. The translation of the <a href="incipit">incipit</a>s is given as in the liner notes of the 2009 recording in the translation by Richard Stokes. The four-part <a href="SATB">SATB</a> chorus is often divided. The work is in <a href="D%20minor">D minor</a> and <a href="Time%20signature%23Notational%20variations%20in%20simple%20time">common time</a>. The tempo marking is "Molto sostenuto", and is sustained with only slight modifications ("<a href="stringendo">stringendo</a>" and "<a href="ritardando">ritardando</a>") until the most dramatic section, marked "Più mosso" (faster) and later "<a href="Tempo%23Italian%20tempo%20markings">Allegro</a>", returning to the initial tempo for the conclusion.

The short instrumental introduction is based on a <a href="pedal%20point">pedal point</a> sustained for several measures, reminiscent of pedal points in funeral music by Schütz and Bach, in <a href="Requiem%20%28Mozart%29">Mozart's Requiem</a> in the same key of D minor, and in Reger's previous Latin Requiem. In a pattern similar to the beginning of "A German Requiem", the bass notes are repeated, here on a low D (<a href="scientific%20pitch%20notation">D1</a>).

The soloist alone sings the intimate appellation "" (Soul, forget them not) on a simple melody and repeating the first line after the second. Throughout the piece the soloist sings only these words, in the beginning and in the repeats. The chorus, here divided in eight parts, evokes the start of the spiritual ascent, "" (See, they hover around you, shuddering, abandoned), in mostly homophonic chords, marked "ppp", in a fashion reminiscent of Schütz.

In section B, "" (and in the holy glowing), the pedal point ends. The chorus is divided in four to six parts, in more independent motion. As in works by Schütz, two or three voices often introduce new text.

The soloist sings the recapitulation of the beginning similar to the first time, again on the pedal point, but repeats the second line one more time, while the chorus sings about the hovering, as before.

In section C, "" (and if you coldly close yourself to them, they stiffen), Reger uses <a href="word%20painting">word painting</a>, by means of downward lines and a final decrescendo for the line "erstarren sie bis hinein in das Tiefste" (they stiffen, up to the deepest). On the word "" (stiffens), the chorus settles on a dissonant 5-part chord, held for two measures, suddenly "<a href="fortissimo">fortissimo</a>" with a crescendo at the end, then repeated "<a href="Dynamics%20%28music%29">pianissimo</a>", an <a href="octave">octave</a> lower, motionless.

In great contrast, in "" (The storm of night then grips them), a storm is depicted in dense motion of four parts <a href="Imitation%20%28music%29">imitating</a> a theme in <a href="Triplet%20%28music%29">triplets</a>.

In the conclusion, the soloist repeats the earlier phrase, but this time the chorus finally joins in the words of the appellation. The soloist introduces a new wording ' (Forget them not, the dead). The chorus repeats this phrase, marked <a href="espressivo">espressivo</a>, <a href="Glossary%20of%20musical%20terminology%23D">dolcissimo</a>, on the melody of the <a href="chorale">chorale</a> ', five stanzas of which Bach used in his "St Matthew Passion". The melody is not repeated as in the original, but continued for half a line. Reger is known for quoting chorales in general and this one in particular, most often referring to its last stanza ', which Bach <a href="St%20Matthew%20Passion%20structure%2361e">included in the Passion</a> right after the death of Jesus. The corresponding text would then be ' (When I must depart one day, do not part from me then. When the greatest anxiety ...).

Reger completes the chorale setting for the chorus, without further reference to the chorale melody, while the solo voice repeats at the same time "", concluding with descending tones of more than an octave.

The "Requiem" employs an orchestra of two flutes, piccolo, two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, three percussionists and strings. It requires a chorus to match. Reger himself wrote a version for piano.

To make the music more accessible, the composer and organist <a href="Max%20Becksch%C3%A4fer">Max Beckschäfer</a> arranged the work for voice, chorus and organ in 1985. The organ version was premiered in the <a href="Marktkirche%2C%20Wiesbaden">Marktkirche</a> in Wiesbaden, where Reger had played the organ himself when he studied there in the 1890s. <a href="Gabriel%20Dessauer">Gabriel Dessauer</a> conducted a project choir, later known as the <a href="Reger-Chor">Reger-Chor</a>. Beckschäfer was the organist, Ulrike Buchs the vocal soloist. The choir, expanded into the Reger-Chor-International by singers from Belgium, performed the work again in 2001 with organist <a href="Ignace%20Michiels">Ignace Michiels</a> from <a href="St.%20Salvator%27s%20Cathedral">St. Salvator's Cathedral</a>, <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a>, both there and in <a href="St.%20Bonifatius%2C%20Wiesbaden">St. Bonifatius, Wiesbaden</a> (recorded live). They performed it a third time in 2010 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Reger-Chor.

The "Hebbel Requiem" was performed as part of the "Ouverture spirituelle" of the 2014 <a href="Salzburg%20Festival">Salzburg Festival</a>, along with Bruckner's <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Bruckner%29">Fourth Symphony</a>, with <a href="Pl%C3%A1cido%20Domingo">Plácido Domingo</a> as baritone soloist and the <a href="Vienna%20Philharmonic">Vienna Philharmonic</a> conducted by <a href="Daniel%20Barenboim">Daniel Barenboim</a>.

To mark the centenary of Reger's death in 2016, the broadcaster <a href="Bayerischer%20Rundfunk">Bayerischer Rundfunk</a> staged a concert of the "Hebbel Requiem" in early May, conducted by <a href="Karl-Heinz%20Steffens">Karl-Heinz Steffens</a>. The <a href="Bachfest%20Leipzig">Bachfest Leipzig</a> 2016 programmed several works by Reger, including the Latin Requiem fragment in the opening concert at the <a href="Thomaskirche">Thomaskirche</a> on 10 June, and the "Hebbel Requiem" there on 17 June, along with "<a href="Der%20Mensch%20lebt%20und%20bestehet">Der Mensch lebt und bestehet</a>" and "<a href="Geistliche%20Ges%C3%A4nge%2C%20Op.%20110">O Tod, wie bitter bist du</a>".

In a review of a recording of choral works by Reger, Gavin Dixon said that the "Requiem" is "almost mystical in its use of widely spaced chords, unusual harmonic shifts and dreamy arpeggios in the accompaniment". The program notes for the recording say that in the "anguished, expressionistic evocation of the 'shuddering', 'forsaken', 'cold' souls, the piece seems determined to expose death in all its grim horror".

Miniopterus griveaudi

Miniopterus griveaudi is a bat in the genus "<a href="Miniopterus">Miniopterus</a>" found on <a href="Grande%20Comore">Grande Comore</a> and <a href="Anjouan">Anjouan</a> in the <a href="Comoros">Comoros</a> and in northern and western <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. First described in 1959 from Grande Comore as a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the mainland African "<a href="Miniopterus%20minor">M. minor</a>", it was later placed with the Malagasy "<a href="Miniopterus%20manavi">M. manavi</a>". However, <a href="morphology%20%28anatomy%29">morphological</a> and <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> studies published in 2008 and 2009 indicated that "M. manavi" as then defined contained five distinct, unrelated species, and "M. griveaudi" was redefined as a species occurring on both Madagascar and the Comoros.

With a forearm length of , "M. griveaudi" is a small "Miniopterus". It is usually dark brown, but sometimes reddish. The <a href="tragus%20%28anatomy%29">tragus</a> (a projection inside the ear) is narrow and ends in a rounded tip. The <a href="uropatagium">uropatagium</a> (tail membrane) appears virtually naked. In the skull, the <a href="palate">palate</a> is concave and the rostrum (front part) is rounded. The species occurs up to above sea level on Madagascar, often in <a href="karst%20topography">karstic</a> areas. In the Comoros, it reaches and roosts in <a href="lava%20tube">lava tube</a>s as well as shallower caves. Females collected on Grande Comore in November were pregnant, but data on reproduction is limited and suggests individual and inter-island variation.

In 1959, David Harrison described a small "<a href="Miniopterus">Miniopterus</a>" from the island of Grande Comore as a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, "Miniopterus minor griveaudi", of the mainland African species "M. minor". The name "griveaudi" honors <a href="Paul%20Griveaud">Paul Griveaud</a>, who collected the specimens on which Harrison based his description. This <a href="biological%20classification">classification</a> remained for the next few decades; in 1992, for example, Javier Juste and Carlos Ibáñez recognized five subspecies, including "griveaudi", within "M. minor", ranging from <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Tom%C3%A9">São Tomé</a> to Madagascar. In their 1995 review of Madagascar bats, <a href="Randolph%20Peterson">Randolph Peterson</a> and colleagues recognized the small Malagasy "Miniopterus" as a separate species, "Miniopterus manavi", with "griveaudi" as a subspecies.

In 2007, Juste and colleagues re-examined the relationships of the "M. minor" group using <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a>s from the <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial</a> <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome "b"</a> (cyt "b") gene. They found that "griveaudi" from Grande Comoro, "manavi" from Madagascar, and "M. minor newtoni" (currently "<a href="Miniopterus%20newtoni">Miniopterus newtoni</a>") from São Tomé were not closely related; however, the representatives of ""manavi"" used in their study were misidentified specimens of "<a href="Miniopterus%20majori">M. majori</a>".

In another <a href="molecular%20phylogenetic">molecular</a> study, published in 2008 and using both cyt "b" and mitochondrial <a href="D-loop">D-loop</a> sequences, Nicole Weyeneth and colleagues found that examined specimens of ""Miniopterus manavi"" actually grouped in two, distantly related <a href="clade">clade</a>s—one including specimens from Madagascar, <a href="Anjouan">Anjouan</a>, and Grande Comore, and the other occurring on Madagascar and Anjouan only.

The next year, <a href="Steven%20Goodman">Steven Goodman</a> and colleagues further explored the relationships of the bats known as ""Miniopterus manavi"" using cyt "b" sequences and <a href="morphology%20%28anatomy%29">morphological</a> comparisons. They found five species within ""M. manavi"", which are not each other's closest relatives, forming an example of <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>. Up to four species of the group may occur in a single locality. "Miniopterus griveaudi", now recognized as a full species, was found to occur on Grande Comore, Anjouan, and northern and western Madagascar, and "M. manavi" was restricted to the eastern margin of Madagascar's <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Madagascar%29">Central Highlands</a>. Three other species were newly described: "<a href="Miniopterus%20aelleni">Miniopterus aelleni</a>" on Anjouan and in northern and western Madagascar; "<a href="Miniopterus%20brachytragos">Miniopterus brachytragos</a>" in northern and western Madagascar only; and "<a href="Miniopterus%20mahafaliensis">Miniopterus mahafaliensis</a>" in southwestern Madagascar. Cyt "b" sequences suggest that "M. griveaudi" occupies an isolated position among African and Malagasy "Miniopterus".

"Miniopterus griveaudi" is a small, dark brown "Miniopterus" species. "M. aelleni" is similar in color, but "M. manavi" is darker and "M. brachytragos" and "M. mahafaliensis" are lighter. The upperparts are occasionally reddish brown; this color variant occurs more often in the Comoro populations than on Madagascar. In the Comoros, individual colonies or groups sometimes consist exclusively of one color variant, but there is no apparent genetic differentiation between the two forms. The head is usually somewhat lighter than the body and the hairs of the underparts have <a href="wikt%3Abuff">buffish</a> tips. The <a href="tragus%20%28anatomy%29">tragus</a> (a projection on the inner side of the outer ear) is straight and narrow and ends in a rounded tip. Other species have differently shaped tragi. The wing membrane is also brown, but the <a href="uropatagium">uropatagium</a> (tail membrane) is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level, near the ankle. The uropatagium is sparsely covered with thin hairs that are virtually invisible to the naked eye. In contrast, "M. manavi", "M. mahafaliensis", and "M. brachytragos" have densely covered uropatagia and that of "M. aelleni" is sparsely, but visibly haired. There are some differences in measurements among the island populations; animals from Grande Comore are generally smallest, those from Anjouan are intermediate, and those from Madagascar are largest.

The animal has a <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a> of 46 <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s, with a total of 50 major arms on the <a href="autosome">autosome</a>s (non-sex chromosomes). The <a href="X%20chromosome">X chromosome</a> is <a href="submetacentric">submetacentric</a> (with one arm slightly longer than the other) and the <a href="Y%20chromosome">Y chromosome</a> is small and <a href="acrocentric">acrocentric</a> (with one very short and one long arm). The karyotype is conserved among species of "Miniopterus"; the number of chromosomes and arms is identical in "M. griveaudi", the Malagasy "M. aelleni" and "<a href="Miniopterus%20gleni">M. gleni</a>", and even the Asian "<a href="Miniopterus%20fuliginosus">M. fuliginosus</a>".

In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is rounded. The central groove in the <a href="nasal%20depression">nasal depression</a> (the lowered area at the nose) is relatively broad in comparison to "M. manavi". The <a href="frontal%20bone">frontal bone</a>s (part of the skull roof) bear a well-developed <a href="sagittal%20crest">sagittal crest</a> (a crest that provides support for muscles of the head). Further back on the <a href="braincase">braincase</a>, the <a href="lambdoid%20crest">lambdoid crest</a> (another such crest) is also prominent. The middle part of the <a href="palate">palate</a> is concave, as in "M. brachytragos" and "M. mahafaliensis", but unlike in "M. aelleni" and "M. manavi", which have a flat palate. At the palate's back margin is a long, robust <a href="posterior%20palatal%20spine">posterior palatal spine</a>.

On Madagascar, the distribution of "M. griveaudi" extends along the western lowlands north to <a href="Ankarana">Ankarana</a> in the far north of the island, and on eastern Madagascar south to the vicinity of <a href="Daraina">Daraina</a>. It is found up to above sea level and often occurs in <a href="karst%20topography">karstic</a> areas. Its range extensively overlaps that of "M. aelleni", which is regularly found in the same forests and caves. Although some ecological and behavioral data has been published on ""Miniopterus manavi"", the recognition of several cryptic species within this group, which may occur in the same places, renders the association of these data with any of the species now recognized uncertain; however, species of "Miniopterus" generally feed on insects. "Miniopterus griveaudi" was assessed as "<a href="Data%20Deficient">Data Deficient</a>" on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> in 2008, but the account predates the recognition of the species on Anjouan and Madagascar.

"Miniopterus griveaudi" is known from altitude on Grande Comore and on Anjouan. In the Comoros, it roosts in caves, both <a href="lava%20tube">lava tube</a>s and shallower structures; it was found to share one cave on Grande Comore with another bat, "<a href="Rousettus%20obliviosus">Rousettus obliviosus</a>". Individuals of "M. griveaudi" have been found to leave a Grande Comore cave at sunset. Flying "M. griveaudi" have mostly been recorded in forests, but this may reflect a lack of survey effort in open areas. In caves, individuals either group in large groups of more than 50 bats without reproductive activity or in smaller groups of at most five reproductively active bats. Limited data on reproduction show some notable variation between individuals and islands. In two caves surveyed on Grande Comore in November 2006, all females were pregnant with single embryos with crown-rump lengths of , but none of the males were reproductively active. In another cave, none of the bats examined at the same time—all males—were reproductively active. None of the bats captured in one of the caves in April 2007 showed signs of reproductive activity. On Anjouan, no bats were reproductively active in two caves surveyed in late November 2006.

Although specimens of "M. griveaudi" differ by only 0.6% in their cyt "b" sequences, analysis of D-loop data does show some differentiation between the island populations. These data suggest that the species originated on Madagascar, where a large, stable population persists, and independently colonized Grande Comore and Anjouan; subsequently, the Grande Comore and Anjouan populations came into contact, resulting in inter-island <a href="gene%20flow">gene flow</a>.

R. V. C. Bodley

Ronald Victor Courtenay Bodley, (3 March 1892 – 26 May 1970) was a <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> officer, author and journalist. Born to English parents in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, he lived in France until he was nine, before attending <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a> and then the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Sandhurst">Royal Military College, Sandhurst</a>. He was commissioned in the <a href="King%27s%20Royal%20Rifle%20Corps">King's Royal Rifle Corps</a> and served with them during the First World War. After the war he spent seven years in the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a> desert, and then travelled through Asia. Bodley wrote several books about his travels. He was considered among the most distinguished British writers on the Sahara, as well as one of the main western sources of information on the <a href="South%20Pacific%20Mandate">South Pacific Mandate</a>.

Bodley moved to the United States in 1935, where he worked as a <a href="screenwriter">screenwriter</a>. He rejoined the British Army at the outbreak of the Second World War and was sent to Paris to work for the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Information%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Information</a>. He later immigrated to the United States, where he continued to work as a writer and also as an advisor to the <a href="United%20States%20Office%20of%20War%20Information">United States Office of War Information</a>.

Bodley was born in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> on 3 March 1892 to civil servant and writer <a href="John%20Edward%20Courtenay%20Bodley">John Edward Courtenay Bodley</a> and Evelyn Frances Bodley (née Bell). He was the oldest of three children; his brother Josselin and sister Ava were born in 1893 and 1896 respectively. His parents divorced in 1908. Bodley was a descendant of diplomat and scholar Sir <a href="Thomas%20Bodley">Thomas Bodley</a>, founder of the <a href="Bodleian%20Library">Bodleian Library</a>, and was, through his mother, a cousin of <a href="Gertrude%20Bell">Gertrude Bell</a>, a writer and archaeologist who helped establish the <a href="Hashemite">Hashemite</a> dynasties. He lived in France with his parents until he was nine. His grandfather owned a Turkish palace in <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a>, which Bodley often visited as a child.

Bodley was educated at a <a href="Lyc%C3%A9e">Lycée</a> in Paris before he was sent to <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a> and then to the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Sandhurst">Royal Military College, Sandhurst</a>. Bodley showed interest as a writer; he wrote poetry at Eton and for a cadet magazine at Sandhurst. From Sandhurst he was commissioned in the <a href="King%27s%20Royal%20Rifle%20Corps">King's Royal Rifle Corps</a> as a <a href="Second%20lieutenant%23United%20Kingdom%20and%20Commonwealth">second lieutenant</a> in September 1911. He spent three years serving in a regiment in <a href="British%20Raj">British India</a> where he began to write and stage plays. His commanding officer once remarked "The plays are amusing. You're a credit to the regiment and all that, but did you join the army to become a soldier or a comedian?" Shortly thereafter the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> broke out, and Bodley was sent to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> for four years. He was wounded several times, including by <a href="Chemical%20weapons%20in%20World%20War%20I">poison gas</a>. At the age of 26 he was given the rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">lieutenant colonel</a> and command of a battalion. He was appointed assistant <a href="military%20attach%C3%A9">military attaché</a> to Paris on 15 August 1918, and attended the <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Conference%2C%201919">1919 Paris Peace Conference</a>. What he heard there reportedly made him feel that he and the millions of other soldiers had fought for nothing; he wrote later that "selfish politicians [were] laying the groundwork for the Second World War – each country grabbing all it could for itself, creating national antagonisms, and reviving the intrigues of secret." Disillusioned with the military, Bodley considered a career in politics on the advice of the Prime Minister, <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a>.

Gertrude Bell introduced Bodley to <a href="T.%20E.%20Lawrence">T. E. Lawrence</a>. Bodley met Lawrence one day outside the Paris Peace Conference and told him of his intent to move into politics. Lawrence responded furiously, calling him a moron and a traitor. When he replied that he had no other prospects now that the war was over and asked what he should do, Lawrence suggested "Go live with the Arabs." Bodley said his conversation with Lawrence, which lasted "less than 200 seconds", proved to be life-changing. He promptly sorted his affairs, and with a total of <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>300 and no prospects of further income, went to live in the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a>. His bemused friends held him a farewell party. They all agreed he would be back in six weeks; he stayed in the Sahara for seven years.

Bodley spent his seven years in the Sahara desert living with a <a href="nomad">nomad</a> <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> tribe. He purchased a herd of sheep and goats and used them as a source of income. He hired 10 shepherds to care for his flock, and consistently earned 120% on his investment. He wore Arab dress, spoke Arabic, practised the Muslim faith and <a href="khamr">abstained from alcohol</a>; Bodley continued to be a non-drinker after leaving the Sahara. He left the tribe on the advice of its chief, who told him there was no use in continuing to pretend to be an Arab. In 1927 he wrote "Algeria from Within", after being encouraged to do so by publisher <a href="Michael%20Joseph%20%28publisher%29">Michael Joseph</a>. The book is based on his experiences living in <a href="French%20Algeria">French Algeria</a>. The book's success greatly exceeded his expectations, prompting him to continue writing. His first novel, "Yasmina", was published later that year; it sold well and was reprinted. His next novel, "Opal Fire", published the following year, was a commercial failure, but this did not discourage him from continuing to write. Bodley regarded his time in the Sahara as "the most peaceful and contented years" of his life. He was considered among the most distinguished British writers on the Sahara.

After leaving the Sahara, Bodley spent three months in <a href="Java">Java</a> working on a tea plantation, before travelling to China and Japan. The success of "Algeria from Within" made it easy for him to obtain work as a journalist in Asia. He became a foreign correspondent for "<a href="The%20Sphere%20%28newspaper%29">The Sphere</a>" in London and "<a href="The%20Advertiser%20%28Adelaide%29">The Advertiser</a>" in Australia. Bodley was one of several westerners to be granted access to the <a href="South%20Pacific%20Mandate">South Pacific Mandate</a> by Japan in the 1930s, and he has been cited as one of the main sources of information on the area at the time. The South Pacific Mandate consisted of islands in the north <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> that had been within the <a href="German%20colonial%20empire">German colonial empire</a> until occupied by <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japan</a> during World War I; Japan governed the islands under a <a href="League%20of%20Nations%20mandate">League of Nations mandate</a>. Like other westerners allowed to visit the region, he reported that there was no evidence that Japan was militarising the area. Bodley's movements were "carefully choreographed" by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Japan%29">Japanese Foreign Ministry</a>. He wrote about his experiences and findings in his 1934 book "The Drama in the Pacific", saying that "having visited practically every island … I am convinced that nothing has been done to convert any place into a naval base". In his 1998 book "Nan'yo: the Rise and Fall of the Japanese in <a href="Micronesia">Micronesia</a>, 1885–1945", <a href="Mark%20Peattie">Mark Peattie</a> stated that while it is easy to accuse Bodley and the other writers of naivety, the militarisation of the area was complex and occurred in several stages. Bodley was a passenger aboard the ship "Shizuoka Maru" when it was wrecked on a reef north of <a href="Yap">Yap</a> in April 1933. The vessel was lost, though there were no injuries. Bodley was offered a job teaching English at <a href="Keio%20University">Keio University</a>, and did so for nine months; he wrote about the experience in his 1933 book "A Japanese Omelette". Bodley and Keio professor Eishiro Hori provided voluminous notes in the 1934 Japanese textbook version of "Round the Red Lamp" by <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, and in 1935 Bodley published a biography of <a href="T%C5%8Dg%C5%8D%20Heihachir%C5%8D">Tōgō Heihachirō</a>.

In 1935 Bodley moved to the United States to work as a <a href="screenwriter">screenwriter</a>, leaving Japan aboard the "<a href="Chichibu%20Maru">Chichibu Maru</a>". In October 1936 Bodley was hired by <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> to adapt the <a href="David%20Leslie%20Murray">D. L. Murray</a> novel "Regency" into a feature film. It was the first time Chaplin had hired someone to write a script; he had previously written his own scripts. Bodley had a rough draft ready by January 1937, and completed his work in March, but Chaplin abandoned the script in late May, in favour of another project he was working on. Bodley also worked on the script for the 1938 film "<a href="A%20Yank%20at%20Oxford">A Yank at Oxford</a>". In the United States, Bodley was known to his friends as "Ronnie" and was often referred to in the press as "Bodley of Arabia".

When the Second World War commenced, Bodley immediately rejoined the King's Royal Rifle Corps and was given the rank of <a href="major%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">major</a>. Regarded as too old for active service in the infantry, he was sent to work for the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Information%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Information</a> in Paris. He was in Paris when the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">German army invaded</a> in May 1940. According to the back cover of his book "The Soundless Sahara", after the fall of Paris he went to work behind the German lines until he came under suspicion of the <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a>, then escaped across the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> on foot. A 2013 biographical journal article on Bodley by William Snell of Keio University made no mention of this work or escape, instead saying that Bodley stayed with his mother and stepfather near <a href="Bayonne">Bayonne</a> after the invasion. According to Snell, after his mother and stepfather refused to leave, Bodley and three other Britons entered Spain via car, with the aid of a friend of Bodley's who worked at the British embassy in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>. Snell concluded his article by saying that while Bodley's life was adventurous, he did tend to dramatise it at times. Bodley returned to the United States via Portugal. Upon his return he focused on a career in writing and lecturing. Bodley would go into complete isolation in order to write a book, spending about ten weeks to complete his work. He wrote several of his books in <a href="York%20Harbor%2C%20Maine">York Harbor, Maine</a>. Bodley frequently gave lectures while travelling the United States, speaking in almost every state and referring to himself as "Colonel" or "Major". Having reached the mandatory age for retirement, he ceased to be a member of the British Army on 3 March 1943. By 1944 he had become a US citizen and was an advisor to the Arabic desk of the <a href="United%20States%20Office%20of%20War%20Information">US Office of War Information</a>.

In 1944 Bodley published "Wind in the Sahara". By 1949 the book was in its seventh edition and had been translated into eight different languages. In 1945 he wrote the satirical novel "The Gay Deserters", which was inspired by his flight from the German army. It was not well received; Robert Pick from the "<a href="Saturday%20Review%20%28U.S.%20magazine%29">Saturday Review</a>" wrote "it isn't even humorous at all". Bodley later said that his talents as a writer lay in non-fiction, adding that of "the many novels (...) and several plays [he] had written, four were published and two produced, and all failed to arouse any interest." He wrote an essay entitled "I Lived in the Garden of Allah", which was included in <a href="Dale%20Carnegie">Dale Carnegie</a>'s 1948 <a href="self-help%20book">self-help book</a> "<a href="How%20to%20Stop%20Worrying%20and%20Start%20Living">How to Stop Worrying and Start Living</a>". In 1953 he wrote "The Warrior Saint", a biography on <a href="Charles%20de%20Foucauld">Charles de Foucauld</a>. John Cogley from "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" said Bodley had "written a clean, poetic and frankly admiring account" of Foucauld's life. In 1955 he wrote the partly-autobiographical self-help book "In Search of Serenity". Elsie Robinson from "The Index-Journal" and Phyllis Battle from the "Tipton Tribune" gave favourable reviews, with Robinson calling it "a must for every rasped spirit". His next and final book, "The Soundless Sahara", was published in 1968; according to the book's back cover he spent part of his years living in <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, and the rest in either England or France. He provided information for the book "The Secret Lives of Lawrence of Arabia", by <a href="Phillip%20Knightley">Phillip Knightley</a> and Colin Simpson, which was published by <a href="Thomas%20Nelson%20%28publisher%29">Thomas Nelson</a> in 1969. He died on 26 May 1970 in a nursing home in <a href="Bramley%2C%20Surrey">Bramley, Surrey</a>.

Bodley married Ruth Mary Elizabeth Stapleton-Bretherton on 30 April 1917 while on extended leave. They had one son, Mark Courtenay Bodley, born 22 May 1918. His wife filed for divorce on the grounds that Bodley was adulterous and drank excessively. He did not contest the petition and the divorce was finalised on 8 June 1926. In his 1931 memoir "Indiscretions of a Young Man", Bodley said the marriage was an "unfortunate action" which "proved the folly of very young people ignoring the advice of their parents." In 1927 he married Australian Beatrice Claire Lamb, whom he met while travelling in North Africa. She filed for divorce around 1939. Bodley's son, who became a lieutenant in the <a href="Royal%20Armoured%20Corps">Royal Armoured Corps</a>, was killed in <a href="Western%20Desert%20Campaign">action in Libya in 1942</a>; "Wind in the Sahara" is dedicated to him. In November 1949 Bodley married American divorcee Harriet Moseley; according to "The Soundless Sahara", published in 1968, they were still married. According to William Snell, there is very little information on his last years, but he believed that Bodley's marriage to Moseley ended in divorce no later than 1969.

Bodley was awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> in the <a href="1916%20Birthday%20Honours">1916 Birthday Honours</a>. He was awarded the Croix de Chevalier of the <a href="Legion%20d%27Honneur">Legion d'Honneur</a> by the President of France in 1919, and appointed Officer of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Star">Ordre de l'Étoile Noire</a> in 1920, Knight Officer of <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Crown%20%28Romania%29">The Order of the Crown</a> by <a href="Ferdinand%20of%20Romania">Ferdinand of Romania</a> in 1920, and the <a href="Order%20of%20Wen-Hu">Order of Wen-Hu</a> (4th Class) by the <a href="Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%9349%29">Republic of China</a> in 1921.

Bodley published 18 books during his career:

2013 Atlantic hurricane season

The 2013 Atlantic hurricane season was a well below average Atlantic hurricane season and the first since <a href="1994%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1994</a> with no major hurricanes. It was also the first season since <a href="1968%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1968</a> with no storms of at least Category 2 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The first <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> of this <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">hurricane season</a>, <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Andrea%20%282013%29">Andrea</a>, developed on June 5, while the final cyclone, an unnamed <a href="Subtropical%20cyclone">subtropical storm</a>, dissipated on December 7. Throughout the year, only two storms—Humberto and <a href="Hurricane%20Ingrid">Ingrid</a>—reached hurricane intensity; this was the lowest seasonal total since <a href="1982%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1982</a>.

The season's impact was minimal; although 15 tropical cyclones developed, most were weak or remained at sea. Tropical Storm Andrea killed four people after making <a href="landfall">landfall</a> in <a href="Florida">Florida</a> and moving up the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast of the United States</a>. In early July, Tropical Storm Chantal moved through the Leeward Islands, causing one fatality, but minimal damage overall. Tropical storms Dorian and Erin and Hurricane Humberto brought only squally weather to the <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde Islands</a>. Mexico, where Hurricane Ingrid, Tropical Depression Eight, and tropical storms <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Barry%20%282013%29">Barry</a> and Fernand all made landfall, was the hardest hit; Ingrid alone caused at least 32 deaths and $1.5 billion (2013 <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>) in damage. In early October, Karen brought showers and gusty winds to the central <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">Gulf Coast of the United States</a>.

All major forecasting agencies predicted an above-average season. All reduced their seasonal predictions in early August, but even the revised predictions were too high. The lack of activity was primarily caused by an unexpected significant weakening of the Atlantic Ocean <a href="thermohaline%20circulation">thermohaline circulation</a> between winter and spring. This resulted in continuation of the spring weather pattern over the Atlantic Ocean, with strong vertical <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>, mid-level moisture, and <a href="Atmospheric%20instability">atmospheric stability</a>, which suppressed <a href="tropical%20cyclogenesis">tropical cyclogenesis</a>.

In advance of, and during, each hurricane season, several <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20seasonal%20forecasting">forecasts of hurricane activity</a> are issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts. These include forecasters from the United States <a href="National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (NOAA)'s <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane</a> and <a href="Climate%20Prediction%20Center">Climate Prediction Center</a>, Tropical Storm Risk, the United Kingdom's <a href="Met%20Office">Met Office</a>, and Philip J. Klotzbach, <a href="William%20M.%20Gray">William M. Gray</a> and associates at <a href="Colorado%20State%20University">Colorado State University</a> (CSU). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. According to NOAA and CSU, the average Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained roughly 12 tropical storms, six hurricanes, three major hurricanes, and an <a href="accumulated%20cyclone%20energy">accumulated cyclone energy</a> (ACE) index of 66–103 units. NOAA typically categorizes a season as either above-average, average, or below-average based on the cumulative ACE Index, but the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season are considered occasionally as well.

Multiple agencies predicted above-average activity, citing forecasts for slower-than-average trade winds, warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures, abnormally low wind shear, and the unlikelihood of an El Niño developing prior to the peak of the season. On December 5, 2012, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), a public consortium consisting of experts on insurance, risk management, and seasonal climate forecasting at <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a>, issued an extended-range forecast. In its report, the organization called for 15.4 (±4.3) named storms, 7.7 (±2.9) hurricanes, 3.4 (±1.6) major hurricanes, and a cumulative Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index of 134. While no value was placed on the number of expected landfalls during the season, TSR stated that the landfalling ACE index was expected to be above average. Four months later, on April 5, Tropical Storm Risk issued its updated forecast, continuing to call for an above-average season with 15.2 (±4.1) named storms, 7.5 (±2.8) hurricanes, 3.4 (±1.6) major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 131; the landfalling ACE index was once again forecast to be higher than normal.

Meanwhile, on April 8, Weather Services International (WSI) issued its first forecast for the hurricane season. In its report, the organization forecast 16 named storms, nine hurricanes, and five major hurricanes.
On April 10, Colorado State University (CSU) issued its first forecast for the season, calling for a potentially hyperactive season with 18 named storms, nine hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 165. The probabilities of a major hurricane hitting the Gulf Coast and East Coast were well above average. On May 15, the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) predicted 14 named storms, with a 70% chance that the number would be between 10 and 18, and nine hurricanes with a 70% chance that the number would be between 4 and 14. It also predicted an ACE index of 130 with a 70% chance that the index would be in the range 76 to 184. On May 23, 2013, NOAA issued its first seasonal outlook for the year, stating there was a 70% likelihood of 13 to 20 named storms, of which seven to eleven could become hurricanes, including three to six major hurricanes; these ranges are greater than the seasonal average of twelve named storms, six hurricanes and three major hurricanes. On May 30, the Florida State University Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies, FSU COAPS, issued its first and only prediction for the season. The organization called for 12 to 17 named storms, of which five to ten would further intensify into hurricanes; no forecast was given for the number of major hurricanes. In addition, an ACE index of 135 units was forecast.

In June, predictions from CSU and TSR were similar to pre-season forecasts due to the a lack of an El Niño and warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic Ocean. However, by July and August, CSU and TSR all adjusted their forecasts downward because of predictions of cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures and above-average wind shear. NOAA also decreased the amount of activity in its final outlook, despite predicting a wetter-than-average western Africa and above-average sea surface temperatures in its report. On June 3, CSU issued its first mid-season prediction for the remainder of the year. In its report, the organization continued to predict well above-average activity, with eighteen named storms, nine hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 165 units. CSU stated that there was a 72% chance of at least one major hurricane impacting any stretch of the United States coastline; the chances of a major hurricane hitting the East Coast and Gulf Coast were 48% and 47%, respectively. The following day, Tropical Storm Risk issued its third forecast for the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season, calling for sixteen named storms, eight hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE of 134 units; this activity was predicted to be roughly 30% above the 1950–2012 long-term mean. TSR gave a 65% probability that the landfalling ACE index would be above-average. A month later, TSR lowered its numbers to 15 named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. On August 2, Colorado State University issued another update for the season, lowering its numbers slightly. However, the organization continued to state that there was an above-average probability of a United States and Caribbean major hurricane landfall. Finally, on August 8, NOAA issued its second and final outlook for the season, predicting 13 to 19 named storms, six to nine hurricanes, and three to five major hurricanes; these numbers were down slightly from its May outlook.

With 13 tropical storms, two hurricanes, and no major hurricanes, activity fell far below the predictions. Brian McNoldy at the University of Miami noted several reasons why NOAA should not cease seasonal predictions, including the variability of hurricane seasons and the value of supplementing climatology with seasonal forecasts. Further, McNoldy argued that forecasting a hurricane season "challenges us to better understand how the atmosphere works." On November 29, Dr. Phil Klotzbach of CSU noted that "[Dr. Gray and I] have been doing these forecasts for 30 years and that's probably the biggest forecast bust that we've had." The program, which had already lost contributions from an insurance company in June, was defunded further following the botched season forecasts. However, Gray and Klotzbach were able to issue predictions for the <a href="2014%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">2014 season</a>.

The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 2013. It was a below average season in which 14 tropical cyclones and one subtropical cyclone formed. Thirteen of the fifteen designated cyclones attained tropical storm status. However, only two of those became hurricanes, the fewest since <a href="1982%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1982</a>; neither of these intensified into a major hurricane, the first such occasion since <a href="1994%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1994</a>. 2013 was also the most active season without a major hurricane. By default, 2013 extended the period without major hurricane landfalls in the United States to eight years since <a href="Hurricane%20Wilma">Hurricane Wilma</a> in <a href="2005%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">2005</a>. Further, neither hurricane exceeded Category 1 intensity for the first time since <a href="1968%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1968</a>. Throughout the season, NOAA and the United States Air Force Reserve flew a total of 45 reconnaissance missions over the Atlantic basin, totaling 435 hours; this was the lowest number of flight hours since 1966. One hurricane and three tropical storms made landfall during the season, causing 47 deaths and about $1.51 billion in damage. Tropical Storm Chantal also caused losses and fatalities, even though it did not strike land. The last storm of the season dissipated on December 7, a week after the official end of hurricane season on November 30, 2013.

Activity was primarily suppressed by significant weakening of the Atlantic Ocean <a href="thermohaline%20circulation">thermohaline circulation</a> (THC) early in the year, representing the largest reduction in strength of the THC since <a href="NCEP/NCAR%20Reanalysis">NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis</a> began. The weakening of the THC was possibly the result of lowered ocean salinity and a decrease in <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Deep%20Water%20formation">North Atlantic Deep Water formation</a>. Oceanic and atmospheric gyres were able to strengthen in the subtropical Atlantic, allowing southward advection of cold air and water. Consequently, there was a significant cooling of <a href="sea%20surface%20temperature">sea surface temperature</a>s over portions of the north Atlantic. This resulted in a continuation of the spring weather pattern over the Atlantic Ocean, with strong vertical <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>, reduced mid-tropospheric moisture, and high <a href="Atmospheric%20instability">atmospheric stability</a>. The weak THC also resulted in slightly stronger <a href="trade%20winds">trade winds</a> and less wind convergence and rainfall in the <a href="Intertropical%20Convergence%20Zone">Intertropical Convergence Zone</a>, with an increase in upper-level zonal winds and higher environmental air pressures. Collectively, these factors worked to suppress <a href="tropical%20cyclogenesis">tropical cyclogenesis</a>.

Tropical cyclogenesis began in early June, with the development of Tropical Storm Andrea in the Gulf of Mexico on June 5. Twelve days later, Tropical Storm Barry formed in the northwestward Caribbean Sea. Two named storms originated in the month of July—tropical storms Chantal and Dorian. Similarly, there were two tropical storms in August, Erin and Fernand. In September, four tropical cyclones formed, three of which strengthened into tropical storms; two of those reached hurricane status. The most intense tropical cyclone—Hurricane Humberto—peaked with <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">maximum sustained wind</a>s of on September 11, which is a Category 1 on the <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20scale">Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale</a>. The other hurricane, Ingrid, was the most devastating storm of the season and peaked at slightly less intensity. Activity began to slow in October, with the development of only two tropical storms, Karen and Lorenzo. Tropical cyclogenesis then halted for almost a month, until Tropical Storm Melissa formed over the eastern Atlantic Ocean on November 18. This was the only tropical cyclone in the month of November. The final system was an unnamed subtropical storm that developed south of the Azores on December 5. After meandering for two days, it degenerated into a remnant <a href="low-pressure%20area">low-pressure area</a> on December 7.

The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 36, well below the 1981–2010 median of 92, and the lowest value since 1994. Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration, such as Humberto, will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of . Accordingly, tropical depressions are not included here. After the storm has dissipated, typically after the end of the season, the NHC reexamines the data, and produces a final report on each storm. These revisions can lead to a revised ACE total either upward or downward compared to the operational value.

An area of low pressure in the eastern <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> developed into Tropical Storm Andrea on June 5. Despite strong wind shear and an abundance of dry air, the storm strengthened while initially heading north-northeastward, before turning northeastward later that day. Andrea intensified and peaked as a strong tropical storm with winds at on June 6. A few hours later, the storm weakened slightly and made <a href="landfall">landfall</a> near <a href="Steinhatchee%2C%20Florida">Steinhatchee, Florida</a>. It began losing tropical characteristics while tracking across Florida and <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>. Andrea transitioned into an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> over <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> on June 7, though the remnants continued to move along the East Coast of the United States until being absorbed by another extratropical system off <a href="Maine">Maine</a> on June 10.

The precursor to Andrea dropped nearly of rainfall on the Yucatán Peninsula. In Cuba, the storm brought flooding, with over 1,000 people fleeing their homes, mainly along the <a href="Cuyaguateje%20River">Cuyaguateje River</a> in <a href="Pinar%20del%20R%C3%ADo%20Province">Pinar del Río Province</a>. In the area, five tornadoes were spawned, one of which damaged three homes. In Florida, the storm brought heavy rainfall to some areas, causing localized flooding. There were 10 tornadoes, the worst of which touched down in <a href="The%20Acreage%2C%20Florida">The Acreage</a>. The twister downed power lines and trees, causing significant roof damage to several houses; there was also one injury. A surfer went missing in South Carolina and was presumed to have drowned. The remnants of Andrea spawned one tornado in North Carolina, though damage was minor. Additionally, flooding was reported in some areas of the <a href="Northeastern%20United%20States">Northeastern United States</a>. Three fatalities occurred due to weather-related traffic accidents in <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> and <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>. The remnants of Andrea brought gusty winds to <a href="Atlantic%20Canada">Atlantic Canada</a>, causing thousands of power outages in <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> and <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a>.

A <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on June 8. The system moved westward and an area of low pressure developed over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on June 16. The low then moved across Honduras, where heavy rainfall triggered flooding that damaged 60 homes and affected 300 people. The low later re-emerged into the Caribbean Sea and developed into a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on June 17, while situated east of <a href="Monkey%20River%20Town">Monkey River Town</a>. About 10 hours later, it made landfall near <a href="Big%20Creek%2C%20Belize">Big Creek, Belize</a>. In that country, an estimated of rain fell in 24 hours, causing several rivers to overflow their banks. In some areas, <a href="culvert">culvert</a>s were washed away. At least 54 people living along Hope Creek were relocated to shelters. In <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a>, flooding and lightning caused one fatality each.

Despite decreasing wind speeds as the storm crossed land, the circulation became better-defined. Early on June 19, the depression emerged into the <a href="Bay%20of%20Campeche">Bay of Campeche</a> and began strengthening due to warm <a href="sea%20surface%20temperature">sea surface temperature</a>s. Around 12:00 UTC, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Barry. After about 12 hours, Barry attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> of . At 11:15 UTC on June 20, Barry made landfall near <a href="Veracruz%20%28city%29">Veracruz</a> at the same intensity. The storm rapidly weakened and degenerated into a remnant low early on June 21. In the Mexican state of <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20%28state%29">Yucatán</a>, wind gusts up to and heavy rains downed trees and power lines. More than 26,000 residents temporarily lost power after lightning struck a nearby power station, leading to a fire. Four deaths were reported in Mexico due to drowning.

A large tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on July 4. The system moved rapidly westward under the influence of a <a href="subtropical%20ridge">subtropical ridge</a>. <a href="Scatterometer">Scatterometer</a> passes indicating a closed circulation confirmed that Tropical Storm Chantal had developed by 12:00 UTC on July 7, while located about east-southeast of <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>. Chantal continued to move swiftly west-northwestward and was one of the fastest moving tropical cyclones in the deep tropics during the satellite era. While approaching the Lesser Antilles, it became disorganized due to wind shear, but at 12:00 UTC on July 9, Chantal peaked with sustained winds of . Shortly thereafter, it crossed through the Lesser Antilles and continued weakening in the Caribbean Sea. By late on July 10, Chantal diminished into a tropical wave while located south of <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a>.

The storm brought heavy rainfall to the Lesser Antilles. In Dominica, several mudslides were reported. Wind gusts up to were observed on the island, de-roofing houses and causing power outages. Strong winds were reported on Martinique, with gusts up to observed in <a href="Fort-de-France">Fort-de-France</a>. Trees were knocked onto roads and power lines, leaving about 33,000 homes without electricity. Elsewhere, damage reported in the Lesser Antilles was minimal, and there were no casualties. Although sustained winds in Puerto Rico remained below tropical storm force, a weather station at Las Mareas in <a href="Guayama%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">Guayama</a> observed a wind gust of late on July 9. Winds toppled trees and power lines, blocking several roads. In Hispaniola, heavy rains caused flooding over portions of the island, but the fast-moving nature of the system precluded a more severe flooding event. In the Dominican Republic, a firefighter from the community of Maimon was killed as he was swept away by flood waters while attempting to clear a clogged storm drain. Chantal's remnant moisture interacted with a <a href="weather%20front">surface boundary</a> over northeastern Florida, contributing to widespread thunderstorms that produced locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds. Overall, the storm caused less than $10 million in damage.

Early on July 22, a tropical wave with an associated low-pressure area emerged off the western coast of Africa. Based on satellite data, the wave was upgraded to a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on July 23 while located about south of the Cape Verde Islands, and further intensified into Tropical Storm Dorian by 06:00 UTC the following day. The storm tracked swiftly west-northwest over warm ocean temperatures and within an environment of low wind shear initially, allowing it to attain peak winds of by July 25. However, the entrainment of drier mid-level air and cooler ocean waters caused a weakening trend.

Late on July 27, a closed low-level circulation ceased to exist and Dorian degenerated into an open tropical wave. The remnants continued west-northwest until August 1, at which time the disturbance reached the western extend of a ridge and curved northward. Despite continued unfavorable wind shear, a broad area of low pressure formed off the east coast of Florida and became increasingly better defined. The convection gained enough organization for the system to be re-designated as a tropical depression by 18:00 UTC on August 2. However, strong northerly winds caused the depression to deteriorate into a remnant low about 24 hours later, southeast of <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>. On August 4, the remnant low was absorbed into a trough off the coast of North Carolina.

A tropical wave, accompanied by a misshapen center of surface low pressure and a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms, emerged from the west coast of Africa on August 15. The wave moved west-northwestward along the southern periphery of a <a href="Ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a> to its north. The system quickly organized and its circulation became more defined, warranting its classification as a tropical depression early on August 15. At the time, the depression was situated about south of <a href="Praia">Praia</a>, <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a>, prompting the issuance of tropical storm warnings for the southernmost islands. Deep convection continued to develop over the center and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Erin six hours after its initial designation. However, dry air quickly became entrained into the circulation and convection waned.

Operationally (in real time), Erin was briefly downgraded to a tropical depression on August 16, though post-storm analysis indicated it retained tropical storm intensity that day. Early on August 17, the ship "British Cygnet" measured winds in relation to the cyclone; around this time, it was estimated that Erin attained its peak intensity with sustained winds of and a barometric pressure of . A temporary northwesterly turn occurred around this time as the storm moved through a weakness in the ridge. Later on August 17, increasing wind shear took its toll on Erin and convection became displaced from the center. The following day, Erin degenerated into a remnant low about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and the west coast of Africa. The remnants proceeded westward on the low-level trade winds before opening up into a <a href="Trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> early on August 20, and ultimately dissipated several days later.
On August 10, a tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa. Another tropical wave, which spawned Tropical Storm Erin, emerged into the Atlantic on August 13. The waves moved westward and merged into a single area of disturbed weather east of the Lesser Antilles. Further development did not occur until it crossed the Caribbean Sea and reached the Bay of Campeche on August 25. A tropical depression formed around 12:00 UTC that day, about north-northeast of <a href="Coatzacoalcos">Coatzacoalcos</a>, <a href="Veracruz">Veracruz</a>. Six hours later, the depression deepened into Tropical Storm Fernand. Early on August 26, Fernand peaked with sustained winds of . At 04:45 UTC, the storm made landfall near <a href="Zempoala">Zempoala</a>, Veracruz, at the same intensity. Fernand weakened to a tropical depression later on August 26, hours before dissipating.

On August 25, a <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches">tropical storm warning</a> was posted for the Gulf Coast of Mexico from <a href="Veracruz%20%28city%29">Veracruz</a> northward to <a href="Tampico">Tampico</a>. Warnings were canceled north of Barra de <a href="Nautla%2C%20Veracruz">Nautla, Veracruz</a> early on August 26, and discontinued entirely after Fernand weakened to a tropical depression. The <a href="Mexican%20Navy">Mexican Navy</a> helped people in <a href="Veracruz">Veracruz</a> evacuate their homes efficiently. Classes at all levels of education in the state were closed during the storm's passage. Impact from the storm in Mexico was most severe in Veracruz, where 13 people were killed by <a href="landslide">landslide</a>s: nine in <a href="Yecuatla">Yecuatla</a>, three in <a href="Tuxpan">Tuxpan</a>, and one in <a href="Atzal%C3%A1n">Atzalán</a>. In the city of Veracruz, heavy rainfall flooded roads, while downed trees caused power outages. In <a href="Boca%20del%20R%C3%ADo%2C%20Veracruz">Boca del Río</a>, flooding stranded people at a shopping plaza. Damage was reported in 19 <a href="Municipalities%20of%20Veracruz">municipalities</a>, mostly in northern and central Veracruz. The storm damaged 457 homes and caused 4 rivers to overflow. In <a href="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a>, a man died after being swept away by a swollen river. After the storm, Veracruz governor Javier Duarte declared a state of emergency for 92 municipalities, which allowed farmers who sustained damage to receive aid.

In late August, a tropical wave accompanied by a broad area of low pressure exited the west coast of Africa. While the wave was south of Puerto Rico, another tropical wave reached the system and enhanced deep convection. Late on September 4, a tropical depression developed about south-southeast of Puerto Rico. Operationally, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gabrielle early on September 5. However, in post-analysis, it was determined that Gabrielle was never a tropical storm in the Caribbean. The depression moved west-northwestward and lost its closed circulation near the eastern tip of Hispaniola late on September 5. During a 48-hour period, the disturbance brought of rain to some areas of Puerto Rico. A mudslide detached part of a small bridge on <a href="Puerto%20Rico%20Highway%20184">Highway 184</a>. On <a href="Saint%20Croix%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint Croix</a>, minor street flooding was reported, and several trees were downed.

The remnant system was monitored for regeneration. By September 9, wind shear began decreasing and the system re-developed into a tropical depression early on September 10. Six hours later, the depression moved northward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Gabrielle. By 12:00 UTC on September 10, it peaked with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . The storm passed about east of <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Bermuda">Hamilton, Bermuda</a> early on September 11. Strong winds on the island downed trees branches, caused minor infrastructural damage, and left minor power outages. After marked oscillations in intensity on September 12, Gabrielle finally succumbed to wind shear midway between Bermuda and Cape Cod.

The eighth tropical depression of the season originated from a tropical wave that crossed the western coast of Africa on August 23. Tracking westward, the wave reached the Caribbean Sea and became increasingly ill-defined while in the central Caribbean. An increase in convection was observed on September 1 and the subsequent day as the wave entered the western Caribbean. After moving into the Bay of Campeche, a broad low-pressure area formed in association with the system on September 5. An increase in deep convection on September 6 led to the formation of a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC, located approximately east-northeast of <a href="Tampico">Tampico</a>, Mexico. The cyclone then moved west-southwest under the influence of an anticyclone.

Around 18:00 UTC on September 6, the depression made landfall near Tampico. Once inland, the depression quickly diminished to a remnant low by 06:00 UTC on September 7. It dissipated six hours later. Heavy rains across <a href="Tamaulipas">Tamaulipas</a> and <a href="Veracruz">Veracruz</a> triggered flooding in areas that had been affected by Tropical Storm Fernand just two weeks prior. The most significant effects were in Veracruz where hundreds of homes were inundated. Record-breaking rains in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>, falling at rates of per hour, caused significant flooding. Many streets were inundated, paralyzing traffic and prompting water rescues. An estimated 20,000 homes were damaged by the floods and officials opened four shelters in the area.

A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on September 7 and spawned a low-pressure area by the following day. At 18:00 UTC on September 8, a tropical depression developed about west-southwest of <a href="Dakar">Dakar</a>, <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>. The depression moved steadily westward and intensified into Tropical Storm Humberto early on September 9. Despite moderate wind shear, Humberto continued to strengthen while passing south of Cape Verde, due to a moist atmosphere and warm ocean temperatures. The storm brought squalls to Cape Verde. The southwestern islands experienced wind gusts exceeding which downed several trees. Heavy rains in many areas triggered flooding that washed out roads and damaged homes. Offshore, the freighter "Rotterdam" went missing with a crew of six amid swells. The vessel eventually reached <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Tom%C3%A9%20and%20Pr%C3%ADncipe">São Tomé and Príncipe</a>, though that country's port institute and coast guard denied her entrance. Later on September 10, the storm's deepening briefly halted as it curved northwest in response to a developing mid-level trough over the central Atlantic.

At 12:00 UTC on September 11, Humberto reached hurricane status while turning northward. About six hours later, it peaked with sustained winds of . By late on September 12, increasing wind shear, cooling sea surface temperatures, and a more stable atmosphere led to a weakening trend of the storm. Around 12:00 UTC on the next day, Humberto fell to tropical storm intensity, while curving west-northwestward in the low-level flow south of the Azores surface high pressure. Early on September 14, the storm degenerated into a remnant low. However, deep convection began re-developing later that day. At 00:00 UTC on September 15, Humberto regenerated into a tropical storm about southwest of <a href="Ponta%20Delgada">Ponta Delgada</a>, Azores. An approaching mid- to upper-level cyclone began to capture Humberto, causing the storm to decelerate between late on September 16 and early on September 17. When Humberto's low-level circulation became vertically stacked under the non-tropical cyclone, the system transitioned into a subtropical storm on September 17. Humberto then weakened to a subtropical depression early the next day, about south of Ponta Delgada. The subtropical depression continued north-northwestward until degenerating into an open trough, and was soon absorbed by a cold front.
A tropical wave spawned an area of low pressure in the Bay of Campeche early on September 12. Several hours later, it matured into a tropical depression about east-southeast of the city of Veracruz. Initially, the depression moved slowly due to weak steering currents. Around midday on September 13, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Ingrid. After initially moving westward toward Veracruz, the storm turned northeastward away from the coast. Favorable conditions allowed it to attain hurricane status on September 14, and the next day Ingrid attained peak winds of . Subsequently, heightened wind shear eroded the storm's convection. Caught between a trough over eastern Mexico and a ridge over the Southeastern United States, the storm turned sharply northwestward and later to the west. On September 16, Ingrid made landfall just south of <a href="La%20Pesca">La Pesca</a>, Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico as a strong tropical storm. Early on September 17, the storm weakened to a tropical depression, shortly before degenerating into an area of low pressure.

Ingrid struck shortly after <a href="Hurricane%20Manuel">Hurricane Manuel</a> on Mexico's Pacific coast, creating the first instance of two landfalling tropical cyclones in the nation within the same 24-hour period since 1958. The combined impacts of hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel affected two-thirds of Mexico, killing 192 people and causing $75 billion pesos (MXN, US$5.7 billion) in damage. Most of the destruction has been attributed to Manuel, but Ingrid was directly responsible for at least 23 deaths and $20 billion pesos (MXN, US$1.5 billion) in losses. The two storms produced approximately 5.7 trillion cubic feet (160 billion m) of rainwater, equivalent to the combined volume of every reservoir in Mexico. Rainfall from the storm peaked at in Tuxpan, Veracruz. The rains caused widespread flooding that damaged at least 14,000 houses and hundreds of roads and bridges. In Tamaulipas, where the storm made landfall, the rainfall damaged crops and flooded rivers. The effects of the storm spread into southern <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, causing high tides and some flooding. After Ingrid's onslaught, the Mexican government declared states of emergency in several municipalities. Relief agencies distributed food and other aid to the hardest hit areas, though in Tamaulipas, residents had to rely on assistance from the local <a href="Gulf%20Cartel">Gulf Cartel</a>.

A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on September 24. Interaction with a mid- to upper-level low pressure forced the wave to split, with the southern portion spawning <a href="2013%20Pacific%20hurricane%20season%23Tropical%20Storm%20Octave">Tropical Storm Octave</a> in the eastern Pacific Ocean on October 12. As evidenced by scatterometer wind data, the northern portion moved north-northwestward and transitioned into a low-pressure area early on September 28. After convection gradually became better organized, a tropical depression developed early on September 29, about east-northeast of the Leeward Islands. The depression moved northeastward and initially struggled to intensify due to the presence of dry mid-level air.

However, early on September 30, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Jerry while curving eastward. Shortly thereafter, vigorous deep convection developed, allowing the storm to deepen further. At 00:00 UTC on October 1, Jerry attained its peak intensity with sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . However, strong wind shear soon weakened Jerry. Later on October 1, a blocking high pressure ridge briefly impeded the storm's northeastward motion, but it resumed moving in that direction by the following day. After losing all deep convection late on October 3, Jerry became extratropical at about southwest of the central Azores. The remnants persisted for a few days, until being absorbed by a larger extratropical low on October 6.

On September 16, a tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa. Minimal tropical cyclogenesis occurred until the wave reached the western Caribbean Sea on September 27. Around that time, the wave encountered an upper-level trough, generating deep convection over the region. On September 28, a broad area of low pressure formed southeast of Jamaica. Based on surface observations, it is estimated that Tropical Storm Karen developed near the northeastern tip of the Yucatán Peninsula early on October 3. Despite a deteriorating cloud pattern, Karen deepened and peaked with winds of later that day. Wind shear and dry air caused the storm to weaken beginning early on October 4. Throughout the day, only sporadic bursts of deep convection occurred. The storm moved northwestward at inconsistent forward speeds around a low- to mid-level ridge. Early on October 6, Karen weakened to a tropical depression, and several hours later disintegrated into an open trough off the coast of Louisiana.

Since the beginning of reconnaissance flights in 1943, Karen was one of few named storms to dissipate in the Gulf of Mexico without making landfall. While the storm was threatening the <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">Gulf Coast of the United States</a>, the NHC issued several tropical cyclone warnings and watches as Karen approached. Additionally, states of emergency were issued in portions of <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, Louisiana, <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, and Florida. The mayor of the town of <a href="Grand%20Isle%2C%20Louisiana">Grand Isle, Louisiana</a> evacuated the island on October 4, while residents were also ordered to flee <a href="Lafourche%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Lafourche</a> and <a href="Plaquemines%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Plaquemines</a> parishes. The <a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) and the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior">United States Department of the Interior</a> called back workers, furloughed because of the <a href="United%20States%20federal%20government%20shutdown%20of%202013">government shutdown</a>, to assist state and local agencies. Louisiana Governor <a href="Bobby%20Jindal">Bobby Jindal</a> authorized the mobilization of the state's <a href="Louisiana%20National%20Guard">National Guard</a> members to active duty.

Abnormally high tides were reported along the coast of Louisiana. At Grand Isle, tar balls from the <a href="Deepwater%20Horizon%20oil%20spill">Deepwater Horizon oil spill</a> in 2010 were washed ashore. In Texas, the storm brought minor coastal flooding to <a href="Brazoria%20County%2C%20Texas">Brazoria County</a>. Additionally, the moisture associated with the remnants of Karen was absorbed into a frontal system and caused minor flooding in a few states, including <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a>, Georgia, New Jersey, and <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>.

A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic on October 11. Four days later, a mid- to upper-level trough increased convection along the northern portion of the wave. The southern portion of the wave continued westward, while the northern portion moved slowly west-northwestward and developed into a surface trough. Eventually, the system transitioned into a broad surface low. Despite southwesterly vertical shear, deep convection began to increase by late on October 20. After becoming better defined, the system developed into a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on October 21 while located about east-southeast of Bermuda. Six hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Lorenzo.

On October 21, the storm moved north-northeastward around the northwestern periphery of a mid-level ridge. Lorenzo strengthened further and peaked with sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of at 12:00 UTC on October 22. Around that time, satellite imagery indicated increased banding and an <a href="Eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a>-like feature. The cyclone then turned eastward in weak westerly low- to mid-level flow. Early on October 23, strong wind shear began impacting Lorenzo, causing the circulation to become exposed to deep convection. At 00:00 UTC on the following day, Lorenzo weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated into a remnant low 12 hours later. The low persisted for a few days, until it degenerated into an open trough on October 26. The remnants of Lorenzo fueled the <a href="St.%20Jude%20storm">St. Jude storm</a>, which struck northern Europe with hurricane-force winds on October 27 and October 28.

Early on November 17, an extratropical low developed along a stationary front over the central Atlantic. It moved northward and became co-located with an upper-level low. After the fronts dissipated, deep convection began to initiate near the center. As a result, Subtropical Storm Melissa developed at 12:00 UTC on November 18, about east-southeast of Bermuda. Melissa moved generally northward and strengthened slightly on November 19, but weakened later that day after convection diminished. Early on November 20, convection increased again, and after the storm acquired a warm core, it was reclassified as a tropical storm.

After becoming a tropical cyclone on November 20, Melissa accelerated northeastward and slowly strengthened. Later that day, the storm attained its peak intensity with sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Amid colder ocean temperatures, Melissa lost all of its deep convection and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 00:00 UTC on November 22, at about north-northeast of <a href="Flores%20Island%20%28Azores%29">Flores Island</a>, Azores. The remnants merged with another system several hours later.

In early December, an upper-level trough became trapped in steering currents near the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>. When an upper-level low strengthened to its west, an extratropical cyclone formed in response on December 3. The cyclone then completed a clockwise loop in response to the blocking area of <a href="high%20pressure">high pressure</a> to its north that would have otherwise caused the storm to move towards mainland <a href="Europe">Europe</a>. Shortly thereafter, the radius of maximum winds—which are usually large in extratropical cyclones—began to contract, signifying the onset of a subtropical transition, despite being over sea surface temperatures. Low wind shear in the area allowed the system to transition into a subtropical storm on December 5 on 00:00 UTC. However, the National Hurricane Center did not initiate advisories, particularly due to predictions of stronger wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures preventing additional development. The storm continued to show more signs of becoming tropical; however, it failed to complete the transition. By December 7, stronger wind shear and cooler waters took its toll on the system, and it weakened to a remnant low, dissipating shortly afterwards. The storm produced sustained winds of on <a href="Santa%20Maria%20Island">Santa Maria Island</a> in the Azores, with gusts to .

Madeline Montalban

Madeline Montalban (born Madeline Sylvia Royals; 8 January 1910 – 11 January 1982) was an English <a href="astrology">astrologer</a> and <a href="ceremonial%20magic">ceremonial magic</a>ian. She co-founded the <a href="Western%20esotericism">esoteric</a> organisation known as the Order of the Morning Star (OMS), through which she propagated her own form of <a href="Luciferianism">Luciferianism</a>.

Born in <a href="Blackpool">Blackpool</a>, <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, Montalban moved to <a href="London">London</a> in the early 1930s, immersing herself in the city's esoteric subculture, and influenced by <a href="Hermeticism">Hermeticism</a> she taught herself ceremonial magic. She associated with significant <a href="occultism">occultists</a>, including <a href="Thelema">Thelemites</a> like <a href="Aleister%20Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a> and <a href="Kenneth%20Grant">Kenneth Grant</a>, and <a href="Wicca">Wicca</a>ns like <a href="Gerald%20Gardner%20%28Wiccan%29">Gerald Gardner</a> and <a href="Alex%20Sanders%20%28Wiccan%29">Alex Sanders</a>. From 1933 to 1953 she published articles on astrology and other esoteric topics in the magazine "<a href="London%20Life">London Life</a>", and from then until her death in the nationally syndicated magazine "Prediction". These were accompanied by several booklets on astrology, released using a variety of different pseudonyms, including Dolores North, Madeline Alvarez and Nina del Luna.

In 1952 she met Nicholas Heron, with whom she entered into a relationship. After moving to <a href="Southsea">Southsea</a> in <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, they founded the OMS as a <a href="correspondence%20course">correspondence course</a> in 1956, teaching subscribers their own magical rites. Viewing <a href="Lucifer">Lucifer</a> as a benevolent angelic deity, she believed Luciferianism had its origins in ancient <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>, and encouraged her followers to contact angelic beings associated with the planetary bodies to aid their spiritual development. After her relationship with Heron ended in 1964, she returned to London, continuing to propagate the OMS. She settled in the <a href="St.%20Giles%2C%20London">St. Giles</a> district, where she became known to the press as "The Witch of St. Giles". She died of lung cancer in 1982.

Having refused to publish her ideas in books, Montalban became largely forgotten following her death, although the OMS continued under new leadership. Her life and work was mentioned in various occult texts and historical studies of esotericism during subsequent decades; a short biography by Julia Philips was published by the <a href="Atlantis%20Bookshop">Atlantis Bookshop</a> in 2012.

Madeline Sylvia Royals was born on 8 January 1910 in <a href="Blackpool">Blackpool</a>, Lancashire. Little is known of her early life, which coincided with Britain's involvement in the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, although she appears to have had a strained relationship with her parents. Her father, Willie Royals, was an insurance agent, while her mother, Marion Neruda Shaw, was a tailor's daughter from <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a>. Willie and Marion had married on 28 June 1909, followed by Madeline's birth seven months later. In early life, Madeline was afflicted with <a href="polio">polio</a>, resulting in a lifelong withered leg and limp. Bedridden for the course of the illness, she read literature to entertain herself, enjoying the works of <a href="Edward%20Bulwer-Lytton">Edward Bulwer-Lytton</a>, <a href="H.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BRider%20Haggard">H. Rider Haggard</a> and <a href="E.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BT.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BA.%20Hoffman">E. T. A. Hoffman</a>. She also read the Bible in her youth, becoming particularly enamored with the texts of the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>, and was convinced that they contained secret messages, a theme that became a central tenet of her later Luciferian beliefs.

In the early 1930s, she left Blackpool, and moved south to London. Her reasons for doing so have never been satisfactorily explained, and she would offer multiple, contradictory accounts of her reasoning in later life. According to one account, her father sent her to study with the famed occultist and mystic <a href="Aleister%20Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a>, who had founded the religion of <a href="Thelema">Thelema</a> in 1904; Montalban's biographer Julia Philips noted that while she met Crowley in London, this story remains implausible. Another of Montalban's accounts held that she moved to the capital to work for the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" newspaper; this claim has never been corroborated, and one of the paper's reporters at the time, Justine Glass, has claimed that she never remembered Montalban working there. Montalban often changed her stories, and informed later disciple <a href="Michael%20Howard%20%28Witch%29">Michael Howard</a> that upon arrival in London, the "Daily Express" sent her to interview Crowley. According to this story, when she first visited him at his lodgings in Jermyn Street, he was suffering from an <a href="asthma">asthma</a> attack, and having had experience with this ailment from a family member she was able to help him, earning his gratitude. They subsequently went to the expensive <a href="Caf%C3%A9%20Royal">Café Royal</a> in <a href="Regent%20Street">Regent Street</a>, where after their lunch, he revealed that he was unable to pay, leaving Montalban to sort out payment.

Although her own accounts of the initial meeting are unreliable, Montalban met with Crowley, embracing the city's occult scene. Having a deep interest in <a href="western%20esotericism">western esotericism</a>, she read widely on the subject, and taught herself the practice of <a href="magic%20%28paranormal%29">magic</a> rather than seeking out the instruction of a teacher. She was particularly interested in <a href="astrology">astrology</a>, and in 1933 wrote her first article on the subject for the magazine "<a href="London%20Life">London Life</a>", entitled "The Stars in the Heavens". Her work continued to see publication in that magazine until 1953, during which time she used different pseudonyms: Madeline Alvarez, Dolores del Castro, Michael Royals, Regina Norcliff, Athene Deluce, Nina de Luna, and the best known, Madeline Montalban, which she created based upon the name of a film star whom she liked, the Mexican actor <a href="Ricardo%20Montalb%C3%A1n">Ricardo Montalbán</a>.

By the end of the 1930s, Montalban was living on Grays Inn Road in the <a href="Borough%20of%20Holborn">Borough of Holborn</a>. In 1939, she married fireman George Edward North in London. They had a daughter, Rosanna, but their relationship deteriorated and he left her for another woman. She later informed friends that during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, George had served in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> while she served in the <a href="Women%27s%20Royal%20Naval%20Service">Women's Royal Naval Service</a> (WRNS), although such claims have never been corroborated. <a href="Gerald%20Gardner%20%28Wiccan%29">Gerald Gardner</a>, founder of <a href="Gardnerian%20Wicca">Gardnerian Wicca</a> – known for his unreliable stories – claimed that he met Montalban during the war, when she was wearing a WRNS uniform, and that at the time she was working as a "personal clairvoyant and psychic advisor" to <a href="Lord%20Louis%20Mountbatten">Lord Louis Mountbatten</a>. Various individuals who knew her would comment that she had in her possession a framed blurry picture of Mountbatten with an individual who looked like her.

She continued her publication of articles under an array of pseudonyms in "London Life", and from February 1947 was responsible for a regular astrological column entitled "You and Your Stars" under the name of Nina del Luna. She also undertook other work, and in the late 1940s, Michael Houghton, proprietor of <a href="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a>'s esoteric-themed <a href="Atlantis%20Bookshop">Atlantis Bookshop</a>, asked her to edit a manuscript of Gardner's novel "High Magic's Aid", which was set in the Late Middle Ages and which featured practitioners of a Witch-Cult; Gardner later alleged that the book contained allusions to the ritual practices of the <a href="New%20Forest%20coven">New Forest coven</a> of Pagan Witches who had initiated him into their ranks in 1939. Gardner incorrectly believed that Montalban "claimed to be a Witch; but got wrong" although he credited her with having "a lively imagination." Although initially seeming favourable to Gardner, by the mid-1960s she had become hostile towards him and his Gardnerian tradition, considering him to be "a 'dirty old man' and sexual pervert." She also expressed hostility to another prominent Pagan Witch of the period, <a href="Charles%20Cardell">Charles Cardell</a>, although in the 1960s became friends with the two Witches at the forefront of the <a href="Alexandrian%20Wicca">Alexandrian Wicca</a>n tradition, <a href="Alex%20Sanders%20%28Wiccan%29">Alex Sanders</a> and his wife, <a href="Maxine%20Sanders">Maxine Sanders</a>, who adopted some of her Luciferian angelic practices. She personally despised being referred to as a "witch", and was particularly angry when the esoteric magazine "<a href="Man%2C%20Myth%20%26amp%3B%20Magic%20%28encyclopedia%29">Man, Myth and Magic</a>" referred to her as "The Witch of St. Giles", an area of Central London which she would later inhabit.

In his 1977 book "Nightside of Eden", the Thelemite <a href="Kenneth%20Grant">Kenneth Grant</a>, then leader of the <a href="Typhonian%20Order">Typhonian OTO</a>, told a story in which he claimed that both he and Gardner performed rituals in the St. Giles flat of a "Mrs. South", probably a reference to Montalban, who often used the pseudonym of "Mrs North". The truthfulness of Grant's claims have been scrutinised by both <a href="Doreen%20Valiente">Doreen Valiente</a> and Julia Philips, who have pointed out multiple incorrect assertions with his account.

From August 1953, Montalban ceased working for "London Life", publishing her work in the magazine "Prediction", one of the country's best-selling esoteric-themed publications. Starting with a series on the uses of the <a href="tarot">tarot</a>, in May 1960 she was employed to produce a regular astrological column for "Prediction". Supplementing such esoteric endeavours, she penned a series of romantic short stories for publication in magazines. Throughout the 1950s she released a series of booklets under different pseudonyms that were devoted to astrology; in one case, she published the same booklet under two separate titles and names, as Madeline Montalban's "Your Stars and Love" and Madeline Alvarez's "Love and the Stars". She never wrote any books, instead preferring the shorter booklets and articles as mediums through which to propagate her views, and was critical of those books that taught the reader how to perform their own <a href="horoscope">horoscope</a>s, believing that they put professional astrologers out of business.
In 1952 she met Nicholas Heron, with whom she entered into a relationship. An engraver, photographer and former journalist for the "<a href="Brighton%20Argus">Brighton Argus</a>", he shared her interest in the occult, and together they developed a magical system based upon <a href="Luciferianism">Luciferianism</a>, the veneration of the deity <a href="Lucifer">Lucifer</a>, or Lumiel, whom they considered to be a benevolent angelic deity. In 1956, they founded the Order of the Morning Star, or "Ordo Stella Matutina" (OSM), propagating it through a <a href="correspondence%20course">correspondence course</a>. The couple sent out lessons to those who paid the necessary fees over a series of weeks, eventually leading to the twelfth lesson, which contained "The Book of Lumiel", a short work written by Montalban that documented her understanding of Lumiel, or Lucifer, and his involvement with humankind. The couple initially lived together in Torrington Place, London, from where they ran the course, but in 1961 moved to the coastal town of <a href="Southsea">Southsea</a> in Essex, where there was greater room for Heron's engraving equipment.

She encouraged members of her OMS course to come and meet with her, and developed friendships with a number of them, blurring the distinction between teacher and pupil. Meetings of OMS members were informal, and rarely for ritual, with the majority of the organisation's rites requiring solitary work. According to later members of her Order, Montalban's basis was in <a href="Hermeticism">Hermeticism</a>, although she was heavily influenced by Mediaeval and Early Modern <a href="grimoires">grimoires</a> like the "<a href="Picatrix">Picatrix</a>", "<a href="Corpus%20Hermeticum">Corpus Hermeticum</a>", "<a href="The%20Heptameron%20%28grimoire%29">The Heptameron</a>" of <a href="Pietro%20d%27Abano">Pietro d'Abano</a>, "<a href="The%20Key%20of%20Solomon">The Key of Solomon</a>", "<a href="The%20Book%20of%20Abramelin">The Book of Abramelin</a>", and <a href="Cornelius%20Agrippa">Cornelius Agrippa</a>'s "<a href="Three%20Books%20of%20Occult%20Philosophy">Three Books of Occult Philosophy</a>". Unlike the founders of several older ceremonial magic organisations, such as the <a href="Hermetic%20Order%20of%20the%20Golden%20Dawn">Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn</a> or the <a href="Fraternity%20of%20the%20Inner%20Light">Fraternity of the Inner Light</a>, she did not claim any authority from higher spiritual beings such as the <a href="Ascended%20master">Ascended master</a>s or <a href="Secret%20Chiefs">Secret Chiefs</a>. She believed that the Luciferian religion had its origin among the <a href="Chaldea">Chaldea</a>n people of ancient <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a> in the Middle East, and believed that in a former life, the OMS's members had been "initiates of the Babylonian and Ancient Egyptian priesthood" from where they had originally known each other. She considered herself the reincarnation of King <a href="Richard%20III">Richard III</a>, and was a member of the <a href="Richard%20III%20Society">Richard III Society</a>; on one occasion, she visited the site of Richard's death at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bosworth">Battle of Bosworth</a> with fellow OMS members, wearing a suit of armour. In March 1964, Montalban broke from her relationship with Heron, and moved back to London.

From 1964 until 1966 she dwelt in a flat at 8 Holly Hill, <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>, which was owned by the husband of one of her OMS students, the Latvian exile and poet Velta Snikere. After leaving Holly Hill, Montalban moved to a flat in the Queen Alexandra Mansions at 3 Grape Street in the St. Giles district of Holborn. Here, she was in close proximity to the two primary bookstores then catering to occult interests, Atlantis Bookshop and Watkins Bookshop, as well as to the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>. She offered one of the rooms in her flat to a young astrologer and musician, Rick Hayward, whom she had met in the summer of 1967; he joined the OMS, and in the last few months of Montalban's life authored her astrological forecasts for "Prediction". After her death, he continued publishing astrological prophecies in "Prediction" and "Prediction Annual" until summer 2012.

In 1967, Michael Howard, a young man interested in witchcraft and the occult wrote to Montalban after reading one of her articles in "Prediction"; she invited him to visit her at her home. The two became friends, with Montalban believing that she could see the "Mark of <a href="Cain">Cain</a>" in his <a href="Aura%20%28paranormal%29">aura</a>. She invited him to become a student of the ONS, which he duly did. Over the coming year, he spent much of his time with her, and in 1968 they went on what she called a "magical mystery tour" to the <a href="West%20Country">West Country</a>, visiting <a href="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>, <a href="Boscastle">Boscastle</a> and <a href="Tintagel">Tintagel</a>. In 1969, he was initiated into Gardnerian Wicca, something she disapproved of, and their friendship subsequently "hit a stormy period" with the pair going "[their] own ways for several years."

A lifelong smoker, Montalban developed lung cancer, causing her death on 11 January 1982. The role of sorting out her financial affairs fell to her friend, Pat Arthy, who discovered that despite her emphasis on the magical attainment of material wealth, she owned no property and that her estate was worth less than £10,000. The copyright of her writings fell to her daughter, Rosanna, who entrusted the running of the OMS to two of Montalban's initiates, married couple Jo Sheridan and Alfred Douglas, who were authorised as the exclusive publishers of her correspondence course. Sheridan – whose real name was Patricia Douglas – opened an alternative therapy centre in <a href="Islington">Islington</a>, <a href="North%20London">North London</a>, in the 1980s, before retiring to <a href="Rye%2C%20East%20Sussex">Rye, East Sussex</a> in 2002, where she continued running the OMS correspondence course until her death in 2011.

According to her biographer Julia Philips, Montalban had been described by her magical students as "tempestuous, generous, humorous, demanding, kind, capricious, talented, volatile, selfish, goodhearted, [and] dramatic". Philips noted that she was a woman who made a "definite impression" in all those whom she encountered, but who equally could be quite shy and disliked being interviewed in anything other than print. Philips asserted that Montalban had a "mercurial personality" and could be kind and generous at one moment and fly into a violent temper the next. Several of her friends noted that she was prudish when it came to sexual matters, and her friend <a href="Maxine%20Sanders">Maxine Sanders</a> stated that even as an elderly lady Montalban boasted of only taking men under the age of twenty-five as her lovers. She would take great pleasure in causing arguments, particularly between a couple who were romantically involved.

Describing herself as a "<a href="paganism%20%28contemporary%29">pagan</a>", Montalban's personal faith was Luciferian in basis, revolving around the veneration of Lucifer, or Lumiel, whom she considered to be a benevolent angelic being who had aided humanity's development. Within her Order, she emphasised that her followers discover their own personal relationship with the angelic beings, including Lumiel. Montalban considered astrology to be a central part of her religious worldview, and always maintained that one could be a good magician only if they had mastered astrology. Her correspondence course focused around the seven planetary bodies that were known in the ancient world and the angelic beings that she associated with them: <a href="Michael">Michael</a> (<a href="Sun">Sun</a>), <a href="Gabriel">Gabriel</a> (<a href="Moon">Moon</a>), <a href="Samael">Samael</a> (<a href="Mars">Mars</a>), <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a> (<a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a>), <a href="Sachiel">Sachiel</a> (<a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>), <a href="Anael">Anael</a> (<a href="Venus">Venus</a>) and <a href="Cassiel">Cassiel</a> (<a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>). Each of these beings was in turn associated with certain days, hours, minerals, plants, and animals, each of which could be used in the creation of <a href="talisman">talisman</a>s that invoked the angelic power. Montalban disliked the theatrical use of props and rites in ceremonial magic, such as that performed by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, preferring a more simplistic use of ritual.

In his book on the <a href="history%20of%20Wicca">history of Wicca</a>, "<a href="The%20Triumph%20of%20the%20Moon">The Triumph of the Moon</a>" (1999), historian <a href="Ronald%20Hutton">Ronald Hutton</a> of <a href="Bristol%20University">Bristol University</a> noted that Montalban was "one of England's most prominent occultists" of the 20th century. Michael Howard referred to Montalban's teachings in his book on Luciferian mythology, "The Book of Fallen Angels" (2004), with <a href="religious%20studies">religious studies</a> scholar Fredrik Gregorius noting that Howard played an "important [role] in furthering an interest" in Montalban's ideas.

In 2012, Neptune Press – the publishing arm of Bloomsbury's Atlantis Bookshop – published a short biography of Montalban entitled "Madeline Montalban: The Magus of St Giles", written by Anglo-Australian Wiccan Julia Philips. Philips noted that for much of the project she found it difficult separating fact from fiction when it came to Montalban's life, but that she had been able to nevertheless put together a biographical account, albeit an incomplete one, of "one of the truly great characters of English occultism."

Rhodocene

Rhodocene, formally known as bis(η-cyclopentadienyl)rhodium(II), is a <a href="chemical%20compound">chemical compound</a> with the formula [Rh(CH)]. Each molecule contains an atom of <a href="rhodium">rhodium</a> bound between two planar <a href="aromaticity">aromatic</a> systems of five <a href="carbon">carbon</a> atoms known as <a href="cyclopentadienyl">cyclopentadienyl</a> rings in a <a href="sandwich%20compound">sandwich</a> arrangement. It is an <a href="Organometallic%20chemistry">organometallic compound</a> as it has (<a href="hapticity">haptic</a>) <a href="covalent%20bond">covalent</a> rhodium–carbon bonds. The [Rh(CH)] <a href="radical%20%28chemistry%29">radical</a> is found above 150 °C or when trapped by cooling to <a href="liquid%20nitrogen">liquid nitrogen</a> temperatures (−196 °C). At room temperature, pairs of these radicals join via their cyclopentadienyl rings to form a <a href="Dimer%20%28chemistry%29">dimer</a>, a yellow solid.

The history of <a href="organometallic%20chemistry">organometallic chemistry</a> includes the 19th-century discoveries of <a href="Zeise%27s%20salt">Zeise's salt</a> and <a href="nickel%20tetracarbonyl">nickel tetracarbonyl</a>. These compounds posed a challenge to chemists as the compounds did not fit with existing <a href="chemical%20bonding">chemical bonding</a> models. A further challenge arose with the discovery of <a href="ferrocene">ferrocene</a>, the iron analogue of rhodocene and the first of the class of compounds now known as <a href="metallocene">metallocene</a>s. Ferrocene was found to be unusually <a href="chemical%20stability">chemically stable</a>, as were analogous chemical structures including rhodocenium, the unipositive <a href="cation">cation</a> of rhodocene and its <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a> and <a href="iridium">iridium</a> counterparts. The study of organometallic species including these ultimately led to the development of new bonding models that explained their formation and stability. Work on sandwich compounds, including the rhodocenium-rhodocene system, earned <a href="Geoffrey%20Wilkinson">Geoffrey Wilkinson</a> and <a href="Ernst%20Otto%20Fischer">Ernst Otto Fischer</a> the 1973 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Chemistry">Nobel Prize for Chemistry</a>.

Owing to their stability and relative ease of preparation, rhodocenium salts are the usual starting material for preparing rhodocene and substituted rhodocenes, all of which are unstable. The original synthesis used a cyclopentadienyl anion and <a href="Metal%20acetylacetonates">tris(acetylacetonato)rhodium(III)</a>; numerous other approaches have since been reported, including gas-phase redox <a href="transmetalation">transmetalation</a> and using <a href="Half%20sandwich%20compound">half-sandwich</a> precursors. Octaphenylrhodocene (a derivative with eight <a href="phenyl%20group">phenyl group</a>s attached) was the first substituted rhodocene to be isolated at room temperature, though it decomposes rapidly in air. <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a> confirmed that octaphenylrhodocene has a sandwich structure with a <a href="staggered%20conformation">staggered conformation</a>. Unlike cobaltocene, which has become a useful one-electron <a href="reducing%20agent">reducing agent</a> in research, no rhodocene derivative yet discovered is stable enough for such applications.

<a href="Biomedical%20research">Biomedical research</a>ers have examined the applications of rhodium compounds and their derivatives in medicine and reported one potential application for a rhodocene derivative as a <a href="radiopharmaceutical">radiopharmaceutical</a> to treat small <a href="cancer">cancer</a>s. Rhodocene derivatives are used to synthesise linked metallocenes so that metal–metal interactions can be studied; potential applications of these derivatives include <a href="molecular%20electronics">molecular electronics</a> and research into the mechanisms of <a href="catalysis">catalysis</a>. The value of rhodocenes tends to be in the insights they provide into the bonding and dynamics of novel chemical systems, rather than their applications.

Discoveries in <a href="organometallic%20chemistry">organometallic chemistry</a> have led to important insights into <a href="chemical%20bonding">chemical bonding</a>. <a href="Zeise%27s%20salt">Zeise's salt</a>, K[PtCl(CH)]·HO, was reported in 1831 and <a href="Ludwig%20Mond">Mond's</a> discovery of Ni(CO) occurred in 1888. Each contained a bond between a metal centre and small molecule, <a href="ethylene">ethylene</a> in the case of Zeise's salt and <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> in the case of <a href="nickel%20tetracarbonyl">nickel tetracarbonyl</a>. The <a href="space-filling%20model">space-filling model</a> of the anion of Zeise's salt (image at left) shows direct bonding between the <a href="platinum">platinum</a> metal centre (shown in blue) and the carbon atoms (shown in black) of the ethylene <a href="ligand">ligand</a>; such metal–carbon bonds are the defining characteristic of <a href="organometallic%20compound">organometallic species</a>. Bonding models were unable to explain the nature of such metal–alkene bonds until the <a href="Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson%20model">Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model</a> was proposed in the 1950s. The original formulation covered only metal–alkene bonds but the model was expanded over time to cover systems like <a href="metal%20carbonyl">metal carbonyl</a>s (including [Ni(CO)]) where <a href="%CF%80%20backbonding">π backbonding</a> is important.
<a href="Ferrocene">Ferrocene</a>, [Fe(CH)], was first synthesised in 1951 during an attempt to prepare the <a href="fulvalene">fulvalene</a> (CH) by oxidative dimerization of <a href="cyclopentadiene">cyclopentadiene</a>; the resultant product was found to have <a href="molecular%20formula">molecular formula</a> CHFe and reported to exhibit "remarkable stability". The discovery sparked substantial interest in the field of organometallic chemistry, in part because the structure proposed by <a href="Peter%20Pauson">Pauson</a> and Kealy (shown at right) was inconsistent with then-existing bonding models and did not explain its unexpected stability. Consequently, the initial challenge was to definitively determine the structure of ferrocene in the hope that its bonding and properties would then be understood. The sandwich structure was deduced and reported independently by three groups in 1952: <a href="Robert%20Burns%20Woodward">Robert Burns Woodward</a> and <a href="Geoffrey%20Wilkinson">Geoffrey Wilkinson</a> investigated the reactivity in order to determine the structure and demonstrated that ferrocene undergoes similar reactions to a typical aromatic molecule (such as <a href="benzene">benzene</a>), <a href="Ernst%20Otto%20Fischer">Ernst Otto Fischer</a> deduced the sandwich structure and also began synthesising other <a href="metallocene">metallocene</a>s including <a href="cobaltocene">cobaltocene</a>; Eiland and Pepinsky provided <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">X-ray crystallographic</a> confirmation of the sandwich structure. Applying <a href="valence%20bond%20theory">valence bond theory</a> to ferrocene by considering an Fe centre and two cyclopentadienide anions (CH), which are known to be <a href="aromaticity">aromatic</a> according to <a href="H%C3%BCckel%27s%20rule">Hückel's rule</a> and hence highly stable, allowed correct prediction of the geometry of the molecule. Once <a href="molecular%20orbital%20theory">molecular orbital theory</a> was successfully applied, the reasons for ferrocene's remarkable stability became clear.

The properties of cobaltocene reported by Wilkinson and Fischer demonstrated that the unipositive cobalticinium cation [Co(CH)] exhibited stability similar to that of ferrocene itself. This observation is not unexpected given that the cobalticinium cation and ferrocene are <a href="isoelectronic">isoelectronic</a>, although the bonding was not understood at the time. Nevertheless, the observation led Wilkinson and <a href="F.%20Albert%20Cotton">F. Albert Cotton</a> to attempt the synthesis of rhodocenium and iridocenium <a href="salt%20%28chemistry%29">salts</a>. They reported the synthesis of numerous rhodocenium salts, including those containing the <a href="bromide">tribromide</a> ([Rh(CH)]Br), <a href="perchlorate">perchlorate</a> ([Rh(CH)]ClO), and <a href="Reinecke%27s%20salt">reineckate</a> ([Rh(CH)] [Cr(NCS)(NH)]·HO) anions, and found that the addition of dipicrylamine produced a compound of composition [Rh(CH)] [N(CHNO)]. In each case, the rhodocenium cation was found to possess high stability. Wilkinson and Fischer went on to share the 1973 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Chemistry">Nobel Prize</a> for Chemistry "for their pioneering work, performed independently, on the chemistry of the organometallic, so called <a href="sandwich%20compound">sandwich compound</a>s".

The stability of metallocenes can be directly compared by looking at the <a href="reduction%20potential">reduction potential</a>s of the one-electron <a href="reduction%20%28chemistry%29">reduction</a> of the unipositive cation. The following data are presented relative to the <a href="saturated%20calomel%20electrode">saturated calomel electrode</a> (SCE) in <a href="acetonitrile">acetonitrile</a>:

These data clearly indicate the stability of neutral ferrocene and the cobaltocenium and rhodocenium cations. Rhodocene is ca. 500 mV more reducing than cobaltocene, indicating that it is more readily oxidised and hence less stable. An earlier <a href="Polarography">polarographic</a> investigation of rhodocenium perchlorate at neutral <a href="pH">pH</a> showed a cathodic wave peak at −1.53 V (versus SCE) at the <a href="dropping%20mercury%20electrode">dropping mercury electrode</a>, corresponding to the formation rhodocene in solution, but the researchers were unable to isolate the neutral product from solution. In the same study, attempts to detect <a href="iridocene">iridocene</a> by exposing iridocenium salts to oxidising conditions were unsuccessful even at elevated pH. These data are consistent with rhodocene being highly unstable and may indicate that iridocene is even more unstable still.

The <a href="18-electron%20rule">18-electron rule</a> is the equivalent of the <a href="octet%20rule">octet rule</a> in <a href="main%20group">main group</a> chemistry and provides a useful guide for predicting the stability of <a href="organometallic%20compound">organometallic compound</a>s. It predicts that organometallic species "in which the sum of the metal valence electrons plus the electrons donated by the ligand groups total 18 are likely to be stable." This helps to explain the unusually high stability observed for ferrocene and for the cobalticinium and rhodocenium cations – all three species have <a href="Analog%20%28chemistry%29">analogous</a> geometries and are <a href="isoelectronic">isoelectronic</a> 18-valence electron structures. The instability of rhodocene and cobaltocene are also understandable in terms of the 18-electron rule, in that both are 19-valence electron structures; this explains early difficulties in isolating rhodocene from rhodocenium solutions. The chemistry of rhodocene is dominated by the drive to attain an 18-electron configuration.

Rhodocene exists as [Rh(CH)], a <a href="paramagnetic">paramagnetic</a> 19-valence electron <a href="radical%20%28chemistry%29">radical</a> <a href="monomer">monomer</a> only at or below −196 °C (<a href="liquid%20nitrogen">liquid nitrogen</a> temperatures) or above 150 °C in the <a href="gas%20phase">gas phase</a>. It is this monomeric form that displays the typical <a href="staggered%20conformation">staggered</a> <a href="metallocene">metallocene</a> sandwich structure. At room temperature (25 °C), the lifetime of the monomeric form in <a href="acetonitrile">acetonitrile</a> is less than two seconds; and rhodocene forms [Rh(CH)], a <a href="diamagnetic">diamagnetic</a> 18-valence electron <a href="bridge%20%28chemical%29">bridged</a> <a href="Dimer%20%28chemistry%29">dimeric</a> "ansa"-metallocene structure. <a href="Electron%20spin%20resonance">Electron spin resonance</a> (ESR), <a href="nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance">nuclear magnetic resonance</a> (NMR) and <a href="infrared%20spectroscopy">infrared spectroscopic</a> (IR) measurements point to the presence of an <a href="chemical%20equilibrium">equilibrium</a> interconverting the monomeric and dimeric forms. ESR evidence confirms that the monomer possesses a high order <a href="axis%20of%20symmetry">axis of symmetry</a> (C, "n" > 2) with a <a href="mirror%20plane">mirror plane</a> (σ) perpendicular to it as <a href="Molecular%20symmetry%23Symmetry%20concepts">symmetry elements</a>; this experimentally demonstrates that the monomer does possess the typical sandwich structure of a metallocene although the interpretation of the ESR data has been questioned. The decomposition pathway of the monomer has also been studied by <a href="mass%20spectrometry">mass spectrometry</a>. The dimerisation is a <a href="redox">redox</a> process; the dimer is a rhodium(I) species and the monomer has a rhodium(II) centre. <a href="Rhodium">Rhodium</a> typically occupies <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a>s +I or +III in its stable compounds.

This dimerisation process has the overall effect of decreasing the <a href="electron%20counting">electron count</a> around the rhodium centre from 19 to 18. This occurs because the <a href="oxidative%20coupling">oxidative coupling</a> of the two cyclopentadienyl ligands produces a new ligand with lower <a href="hapticity">hapticity</a> and which donates fewer electrons to the metal centre. The term hapticity is used to indicate the "number of carbon (or other) atoms through which [a ligand] binds ("n")" to a metal centre and is symbolised as η. For example, the ethylene ligand in Zeise's salt is bound to the platinum centre through both carbon atoms, and it hence formally has the formula K[PtCl(η-CH)]·HO. The carbonyl ligands in nickel tetracarbonyl are each bound through only a carbon atom and are hence described as monohapto ligands, but η-notations are typically omitted in formulae. The cyclopentadienyl ligands in many <a href="metallocene">metallocene</a> and <a href="Sandwich%20compound%23Half%20sandwich%20compounds">half-sandwich compounds</a> are pentahapto ligands, hence the formula [Rh(η-CH)] for the rhodocene monomer. In the rhodocene dimer, the coupled cyclopentadienyl ligands are 4-electron tetrahapto donors to each rhodium(I) metal centre, in contrast to the 6-electron pentahapto cyclopentadienyl donors. The increased stability of the 18-valence electron rhodium(I) dimer species as compared to the 19-valence electron rhodium(II) monomer likely explains why the monomer is only detected under extreme conditions.
Cotton and Wilkinson demonstrated that the 18-valence electron rhodium(III) rhodocenium cation [Rh(η-CH)] can be reduced in aqueous solution to the monomeric form; they were unable to isolate the neutral product as not only can it dimerise, the rhodium(II) radical monomer can also spontaneously form the mixed-hapticity stable rhodium(I) species [(η-CH)Rh(η-CH)]. The differences between rhodocene and this derivative are found in two areas: (1) One of the bound cyclopentadienyl ligands has formally gained a hydrogen atom to become cyclopentadiene, which remains bound to the metal centre but now as a 4-electron η- donor. (2) The rhodium(II) metal centre has been reduced to rhodium(I). These two changes make the derivative an 18-valence electron species. Fischer and colleagues hypothesised that the formation of this rhodocene derivative might occur in separate protonation and reduction steps, but published no evidence to support this suggestion. (η-Cyclopentadiene)(η-cyclopentadienyl)rhodium(I), the resulting compound, is an unusual organometallic complex in that it has both a cyclopentadienyl anion and cyclopentadiene itself as ligands. It has been shown that this compound can also be prepared by <a href="sodium%20borohydride">sodium borohydride</a> reduction of a rhodocenium solution in aqueous <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a>; the researchers who made this discovery characterised the product as biscyclopentadienylrhodium hydride.

Fischer and co-workers also studied the chemistry of iridocene, the third transition series analogue of rhodocene and cobaltocene, finding the chemistry of rhodocene and iridocene are generally similar. The synthesis of numerous iridocenium salts including the tribromide and <a href="hexafluorophosphate">hexafluorophosphate</a> have been described. Just as with rhodocene, iridocene dimerises at room temperature but a monomer form can be detected at low temperatures and in gas phase and IR, NMR, and ESR measurements indicate a chemical equilibrium is present and confirm the sandwich structure of the iridocene monomer. The complex [(η-CH)Ir(η-CH)], the analogue of rhodocene derivative reported by Fischer, has also been studied and demonstrates properties consistent with a greater degree of π-backbonding in iridium(I) systems than is found in the analogous cobalt(I) or rhodium(I) cases.

Rhodocenium salts were first reported within two years of the discovery of ferrocene. These salts were prepared by reacting the <a href="carbanion">carbanion</a> <a href="Grignard%20reaction">Grignard reagent</a> cyclopentadienylmagnesium bromide (CHMgBr) with <a href="Metal%20acetylacetonates">tris(acetylacetonato)rhodium(III)</a> (Rh(acac)). More recently, gas-phase rhodocenium cations have been generated by a <a href="redox">redox</a> <a href="transmetalation">transmetalation</a> reaction of rhodium(I) ions with ferrocene or <a href="nickelocene">nickelocene</a>.

Modern <a href="microwave%20chemistry">microwave synthetic methods</a> have also been reported. Rhodocenium hexafluorophosphate forms after reaction of cyclopentadiene and <a href="rhodium%28III%29%20chloride">rhodium(III) chloride hydrate</a> in <a href="methanol">methanol</a> following <a href="work-up%20%28chemistry%29">work-up</a> with methanolic <a href="ammonium%20hexafluorophosphate">ammonium hexafluorophosphate</a>; the reaction <a href="yield%20%28chemistry%29">yield</a> exceeds 60% with only 30 seconds of exposure to <a href="microwave%20radiation">microwave radiation</a>.

Rhodocene itself is then formed by reduction of rhodocenium salts with molten <a href="sodium">sodium</a>. If a rhodocenium containing melt is treated with sodium or potassium metals and then <a href="sublimation%20%28phase%20transition%29">sublimed</a> onto a liquid nitrogen-cooled cold finger, a black polycrystalline material results. Warming this material to room temperature produces a yellow solid which has been confirmed as the rhodocene dimer. A similar method can be used to prepare the iridocene dimer.

Novel approaches to synthesising substituted cyclopentadienyl complexes have been developed using substituted vinylcyclopropene starting materials. Ring-enlarging <a href="vinylcyclopropane%20rearrangement">vinylcyclopropane rearrangement</a> reactions to produce cyclopentenes are well known and serve as precedent for vinylcyclopropenes <a href="rearrangement%20reaction">rearranging</a> to cyclopentadienes. The [(η-C<a href="tert-butyl">Bu</a>H)Rh(η-CH)] cation has been generated by a reaction sequence beginning with addition of the chlorobisethylenerhodium(I) dimer, [(η-CH)Rh(μ-Cl)], to 1,2,3-tri-"tert"-butyl-3-vinyl-1-cyclopropene followed by reaction with <a href="thallium%20cyclopentadienide">thallium cyclopentadienide</a>:

The 18-valence electron rhodium(III) pentadienediyl species generated by this reaction demonstrates again the instability of the rhodocene moiety, in that it can be refluxed in toluene for months without 1,2,3-tri-"tert"-butylrhodocene forming but in oxidising conditions the 1,2,3-tri-"tert"-butylrhodocenium cation forms rapidly. Cyclic voltammetry has been used to investigate this and similar processes in detail. The mechanism of the reaction has been shown to involve a loss of one electron from the pentadienediyl ligand followed by a fast rearrangement (with loss of a hydrogen atom) to form the 1,2,3-tri-"tert"-butylrhodocenium cation. Both the <a href="tetrafluoroborate">tetrafluoroborate</a> and hexafluorophosphate salts of this cation have been structurally characterised by X-ray crystallography.

[(η-CBuH)Rh(η-CH)]BF forms a colourless <a href="centrosymmetric">centrosymmetric</a> <a href="monoclinic%20crystal%20system">monoclinic</a> crystal belonging to the "P"2/c <a href="space%20group">space group</a>, and with a <a href="density">density</a> of 1.486 g cm. Looking at the <a href="molecular%20graphics">ORTEP</a> diagram of the structure of the cation (at right), it is evident that it possesses the typical geometry expected of a rhodocene or rhodocenium cation. The two cyclopentadienyl rings are close to parallel (the <a href="centroid">centroid</a>–Rh–centroid angle is 177.2°) and the rhodium centre is slightly closer to the substituted cyclopentadienyl ring (Rh–centroid distances are 1.819 <a href="%C3%85ngstr%C3%B6m">Å</a> and 1.795 Å), an observation attributed to the greater inductive effect of the <a href="tert-butyl">"tert"-butyl</a> groups on the substituted ligand. The ORTEP diagram shows that the cation adopts an eclipsed conformation in the solid state. The crystal structure of the hexafluorophosphate salt shows three crystallographically independent cations, one eclipsed, one staggered, and one which is rotationally disordered. This suggests that the conformation adopted is dependent on the anion present and also that the energy barrier to rotation is low – in ferrocene, the rotational energy barrier is known to be ~5 kJ mol in both solution and gas phase.

The diagram above shows the rhodium–carbon ( inside pentagons on the left) and carbon–carbon ( outside pentagons on the left) bond distances for both ligands, along with the bond angles ( inside pentagons on the right) within each cyclopentadienyl ring. The atom labels used are the same as those shown in the crystal structure above. Within the unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligand, the carbon–carbon bond lengths vary between 1.35 Å and 1.40 Å and the internal bond angles vary between 107° and 109°. For comparison, the internal angle at each vertex of a <a href="regular%20pentagon">regular pentagon</a> is 108°. The rhodium–carbon bond lengths vary between 2.16 Å and 2.18 Å. These results are consistent with η-coordination of the ligand to the metal centre. In the case of the substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand, there is somewhat greater variation: carbon–carbon bond lengths vary between 1.39 Å and 1.48 Å, the internal bond angles vary between 106° and 111°, and the rhodium–carbon bond lengths vary between 2.14 Å and 2.20 Å. The greater variation in the substituted ligand is attributed to the distortions necessary to relieve the steric strain imposed by neighbouring "tert"-butyl substituents; despite these variations, the data demonstrate that the substituted cyclopentadienyl is also η-coordinated.

The stability of metallocenes changes with ring substitution. Comparing the reduction potentials of the cobaltocenium and decamethylcobaltocenium cations shows that the decamethyl species is ca. 600 mV more reducing than its parent metallocene, a situation also observed in the ferrocene and rhodocene systems. The following data are presented relative to the ferrocenium / ferrocene <a href="redox%20couple">redox couple</a>:

The differences in reduction potentials is attributed in the cobaltocenium system to the inductive effect of the alkyl groups, further stabilising the 18-valence electron species. A similar effect is seen in the rhodocenium data shown above, again consistent with inductive effects. In the substituted iridocenium system, cyclic voltammetry investigations shows irreversible reductions at temperatures as low as −60 °C; by comparison, the reduction of the corresponding rhodocenes is quasi-reversible at room temperature and fully reversible at −35 °C. The irreversibility of the substituted iridocenium reductions is attributed to the extremely rapid dimerisation of the resulting 19-valence electron species, which further illustrates that iridocenes are less stable than their corresponding rhodocenes.

The body of knowledge concerning compounds with penta-substituted cyclopentadienyl ligands is extensive, with organometallic <a href="complex%20%28chemistry%29">complexes</a> of the <a href="Pentamethylcyclopentadiene%23Synthesis%20of%20Cp%2A%20complexes">pentamethylcyclopentadienyl</a> and pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl ligands being well-known. Substitutions on the cyclopentadienyl rings of rhodocenes and rhodocenium salts produce compounds of higher stability as they allow for the increased delocalisation of positive charge or <a href="electron%20density">electron density</a> and also provide <a href="steric%20hindrance">steric hindrance</a> against other species approaching the metal centre. Various mono- and di-substituted rhodocenium species are known, but substantial stabilisation is not achieved without greater substitutions. Known highly substituted rhodocenium salts include decamethylrhodocenium hexafluorophosphate [(η-C<a href="methyl">Me</a>)Rh]PF, decaisopropylrhodocenium hexafluorophosphate [(η-C<a href="isopropyl">Pr</a>)Rh]PF, and octaphenylrhodocenium hexafluorophosphate [(η-C<a href="phenyl">Ph</a>H)Rh]PF. Decamethylrhodocenium tetrafluoroborate can be synthesised from the tris(acetone) complex [(η-CMe)Rh(MeCO)](BF) by reaction with <a href="pentamethylcyclopentadiene">pentamethylcyclopentadiene</a>, and the analogous iridium synthesis is also known. Decaisopropylrhodicnium hexafluorophosphate was synthesised in <a href="1%2C2-dimethoxyethane">1,2-dimethoxyethane</a> (<a href="solvent">solvent</a>) in an unusual <a href="one-pot%20synthesis">one-pot synthesis</a> that involves the formation of 20 <a href="carbon-carbon%20bond%23Synthesis">carbon–carbon bonds</a>:

In a similar reaction, pentaisopropylrhodocenium hexafluorophosphate [(η-CPr)Rh(η-CH)]PF can be synthesised from pentamethylrhodocenium hexafluorophosphate [(η-CMe)Rh(η-CH)]PF in 80% yield. These reactions demonstrate that the acidity of the methyl hydrogens in a pentamethylcyclopentadienyl complex can be considerably increased by the presence of the metal centre. Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds with <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a> deprotonating a methyl group and the resulting carbanion undergoing <a href="nucleophilic%20substitution">nucleophilic substitution</a> with <a href="methyl%20iodide">methyl iodide</a> to form a new carbon–carbon bond.

The compounds pentaphenylrhodocenium <a href="tetrafluoroborate">tetrafluoroborate</a> [(η-CPh)Rh(η-CH)]BF, and pentamethylpentaphenylrhodocenium tetrafluoroborate [(η-CPh)Rh(η-CMe)]BF have also been reported. They demonstrate that rhodium sandwich compounds can be prepared from half-sandwich precursors. For example, in an approach broadly similar to the tris(acetone) synthesis of decamethylrhodocenium tetrafluoroborate, pentaphenylrhodocenium tetrafluoroborate has been synthesised from the tris(<a href="acetonitrile">acetonitrile</a>) salt [(η-CPh)Rh(CHCN)](BF) by reaction with <a href="sodium%20cyclopentadienide">sodium cyclopentadienide</a>:

Octaphenylrhodocene, [(η-CPhH)Rh], is the first rhodocene derivative to be isolated at room temperature. Its olive green crystals decompose rapidly in solution, and within minutes in air, demonstrating a dramatically greater air sensitivity than the analogous <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a> complex, although it is significantly more stable than rhodocene itself. This difference is attributed to the relatively lower stability of the rhodium(II) state as compared to the cobalt(II) state. The reduction potential for the [(η-CPhH)Rh] cation (measured in <a href="dimethylformamide">dimethylformamide</a> relative the ferrocenium / ferrocene couple) is −1.44 V, consistent with the greater thermodynamic stabilisation of the rhodocene by the CHPh ligand compared with the CH or CMe ligands. Cobaltocene is a useful one-electron <a href="reducing%20agent">reducing agent</a> in the research laboratory as it is soluble in <a href="non-polar">non-polar</a> organic solvents, and its redox couple is sufficiently well behaved that it may be used as an <a href="internal%20standard">internal standard</a> in <a href="cyclic%20voltammetry">cyclic voltammetry</a>. No substituted rhodocene yet prepared has demonstrated sufficient stability to be used in a similar way.

The synthesis of octaphenylrhodocene proceeds in three steps, with a <a href="diglyme">diglyme</a> reflux followed by workup with <a href="hexafluorophosphoric%20acid">hexafluorophosphoric acid</a>, then a <a href="sodium%20amalgam">sodium amalgam</a> reduction in <a href="tetrahydrofuran">tetrahydrofuran</a>:

The <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">crystal structure</a> of octaphenylrhodocene shows a staggered conformation (similar to that of ferrocene, and in contrast to the <a href="eclipsed%20conformation">eclipsed conformation</a> of <a href="ruthenocene">ruthenocene</a>). The rhodium–centroid distance is 1.904 Å and the rhodium–carbon bond lengths average 2.26 Å; the carbon–carbon bond lengths average 1.44 Å. These distances are all similar to those found in the 1,2,3-tri-"tert"-butylrhodocenium cation described above, with the one difference that the effective size of the rhodium centre appears larger, an observation consistent with the expanded ionic radius of rhodium(II) compared with rhodium(III).

There has been extensive research into <a href="metallopharmaceutical">metallopharmaceutical</a>s, including discussion of rhodium compounds in medicine. A substantial body of research has examined using metallocene derivatives of <a href="ruthenium">ruthenium</a> and iron as metallopharmaceuticals. One area of such research has utilised metallocenes in place of the fluorophenyl group in <a href="haloperidol">haloperidol</a>, which is a <a href="pharmaceutical">pharmaceutical</a> classified as a <a href="typical%20antipsychotic">typical antipsychotic</a>. The ferrocenyl–haloperidol compound investigated has structure (CH)Fe(CH)–C(=O)–(CH)–N(CHCH)C(OH)–CHCl and can be converted to the ruthenium analog via a transmetalation reaction. Using the <a href="radioactive">radioactive</a> <a href="isotope">isotope</a> <a href="ruthenium-103">Ru</a> produces a ruthenocenyl–haloperidol radiopharmaceutical with a high affinity for <a href="lung">lung</a> but not <a href="brain">brain</a> <a href="tissue%20%28biology%29">tissue</a> in <a href="mice">mice</a> and <a href="rat">rat</a>s. <a href="Beta-decay">Beta-decay</a> of Ru produces the <a href="Nuclear%20isomer%23Metastable%20isomers">metastable isotope</a> <a href="rhodium-103m">Rh</a> in a rhodocenyl–haloperidol compound. This compound, like other rhodocene derivatives, has an unstable 19-valence electron configuration and rapidly oxidises to the expected cationic rhodocenium–haloperidol species. The separation of the ruthenocenyl–haloperidol and the rhodocenium–haloperidol species and the distributions of each amongst bodily organs has been studied. Rh has a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 56 min and emits a <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a> of energy 39.8 <a href="keV">keV</a>, so the <a href="gamma-decay">gamma-decay</a> of the rhodium isotope should follow soon after the beta-decay of the ruthenium isotope. Beta- and gamma-emitting <a href="radionuclide">radionuclide</a>s used medically include <a href="iodine-131">I</a>, <a href="Radiopharmacology%23Iron-59">Fe</a>, and <a href="Radiopharmacology%23Calcium-47">Ca</a>, and Rh has been proposed for use in <a href="radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> for small tumours.

The original motivation for research investigations of the rhodocene system was to understand the nature of and bonding within the metallocene class of compounds. In more recent times, interest has been rekindled by the desire to explore and apply the metal–metal interactions that occur when metallocene systems are linked. Potential applications for such systems include <a href="molecular%20electronics">molecular electronics</a>, semi-conducting (and possibly <a href="ferromagnetic">ferromagnetic</a>) metallocene polymers (an example of a <a href="molecular%20wire">molecular wire</a>), and exploring the threshold between <a href="heterogeneous%20catalysis">heterogeneous</a> and <a href="homogeneous%20catalysis">homogeneous catalysis</a>. Examples of known bimetallocenes and termetallocenes that possess the rhodocenyl moiety include the hexafluorophosphate salts of rhodocenylferrocene, 1,1'-dirhodocenylferrocene, and 1-cobaltocenyl-1'-rhodocenylferrocene, each shown at right. Linked metallocenes can also be formed by introducing several metallocenyl substituents onto a single cyclopentadienyl ligand.

Structural studies of termetallocene systems have shown they typically adopt an "eclipsed double transoid" "crankshaft" geometry. Taking as an example the 1-cobaltocenyl-1'-rhodocenylferrocene cation shown above, this means that the cobaltocenyl and rhodocenyl moieties are eclipsed, and thus carbon atoms 1 and 1' on the central ferrocene core are as close to vertically aligned as is possible given the staggered conformation of the cyclopentadienyl rings within each metallocene unit. Viewed from side-on, this means termetallocenes resemble the down–up–down pattern of a <a href="crankshaft">crankshaft</a>. The synthesis of this termetallocene involves the combining of rhodocenium and cobaltocenium solutions with <a href="Ferrocene%23Lithiation">1,1'-dilithioferrocene</a>. This produces an uncharged intermediate with linked cyclopentadienyl–cyclopentadiene ligands whose bonding resembles that found in the rhodocene dimer. These ligands then react with the <a href="triphenylmethyl%20hexafluorophosphate">triphenylmethyl carbocation</a> to generate the termetallocene salt, [(η-CH)Rh(μ-η:η-CH–CH)Fe(μ-η:η-CH–CH)Co(η-CH)](PF). This synthetic pathway is illustrated below:

The first rhodocenium-containing side-chain polymers were prepared through controlled polymerization techniques such as <a href="reversible%20addition%E2%88%92fragmentation%20chain-transfer%20polymerization">reversible addition−fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization</a> (RAFT) and <a href="ring-opening%20metathesis%20polymerisation">ring-opening metathesis polymerisation</a> (ROMP).

Salanoia durrelli

Salanoia durrelli, also known as Durrell's vontsira, is a <a href="Madagascar">Madagascan</a> mammal in the family <a href="Eupleridae">Eupleridae</a> of the order <a href="Carnivora">Carnivora</a>. It is most closely related to the <a href="brown-tailed%20mongoose">brown-tailed mongoose</a> ("Salanoia concolor"), with which it forms the genus "<a href="Salanoia">Salanoia</a>". The two are genetically similar, but <a href="morphology%20%28anatomy%29">morphologically</a> distinct, leading scientists to recognize them as separate species. After an individual was observed in 2004, the animal became known to science and "S. durrelli" was described as a new species in 2010. It is found only in the <a href="Lake%20Alaotra">Lac Alaotra</a> area.

A small, reddish-brown carnivore, "Salanoia durrelli" is characterized by broad feet with prominent <a href="Paw%23Common%20characteristics">pads</a>, reddish-<a href="wikt%3Abuff">buff</a> underparts, and broad, robust teeth, among other differences from the brown-tailed mongoose. In the only two weighed specimens, body mass was . It is a marsh-dwelling animal that may feed on <a href="crustacea">crustacea</a>ns and <a href="mollusk">mollusk</a>s. The Lac Alaotra area is a threatened ecosystem, and "S. durrelli" may also be endangered by competition with <a href="introduced%20species">introduced species</a>.

An individual "Salanoia durrelli" was observed swimming in 2004 by the <a href="Durrell%20Wildlife%20Conservation%20Trust">Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust</a> (DWCT) during a survey of <a href="bamboo%20lemur">bamboo lemur</a>s ("Hapalemur") in the <a href="Lake%20Alaotra">Lac Alaotra</a> area, the largest <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s of Madagascar. The animal was captured, photographed, and then released, but examination of the photograph showed that it could not be identified with any known species of Malagasy carnivoran (family <a href="Eupleridae">Eupleridae</a>). Therefore, two specimens were caught in 2005 by the DWCT. One was killed to facilitate additional morphological comparisons. In 2010, it was formally described as "Salanoia durrelli" in a paper by conservationist Joanna Durbin and a team of scientists from the <a href="Climate%2C%20Community%20%26amp%3B%20Biodiversity%20Alliance">Climate, Community & Biodiversity Alliance</a>, <a href="Nature%20Heritage">Nature Heritage</a>, the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a>, <a href="Conservation%20International">Conservation International</a>, and the DWCT. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a>, "durrelli", honors <a href="Gerald%20Durrell">Gerald Durrell</a>, a noted conservationist and the founder of the DWCT. Previously, local villagers had already reported the presence of a small carnivoran at Alaotra, and it was speculated that the animal was the closely related <a href="brown-tailed%20mongoose">brown-tailed mongoose</a> ("Salanoia concolor").

"Salanoia durrelli" was placed in the genus "<a href="Salanoia">Salanoia</a>", which previously included only the brown-tailed mongoose of eastern Madagascar. "S. durrelli" shows substantial <a href="morphology%20%28anatomy%29">morphological</a> differences from the brown-tailed mongoose, but the <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> of the two species is very similar. The discoverers chose to recognize the Lac Alaotra population as a separate species in view of its significant morphological differentiation. The observed morphological distinctiveness might be result of <a href="adaptation">adaptation</a>s to life in the Alaotra wetlands, similar to the Alaotra bamboo lemur species, "<a href="Hapalemur%20alaotrensis">Hapalemur alaotrensis</a>", which is also recognized as a distinct species despite being genetically close to the more widespread "<a href="Hapalemur%20griseus">Hapalemur griseus</a>".

"Salanoia durrelli" most closely resembles the brown-tailed mongoose, which is a small, <a href="wikt%3Agracile">gracile</a> <a href="mongoose">mongoose</a>-like carnivoran. It is reddish-brown overall, paler than the brown-tailed mongoose. The head and <a href="nape">nape</a> are speckled. The underparts are reddish-<a href="wikt%3Abuff">buff</a>, not brownish as in the brown-tailed mongoose. Most of the tail is similar in color to the body, but the tip is yellowish-brown. The inner side of the well-furred external ear (<a href="pinna%20%28anatomy%29">pinna</a>) is reddish-buff. The broad feet are naked below, with the naked skin buff on the forefeet and dark brown on the hindfeet, and show prominent <a href="Paw%23Common%20characteristics">pads</a>. Each of the five digits on the fore- and hindfeet bears a long, dark brown claw. There are rows of stiff hairs along the outer margins of the feet. In contrast, the brown-tailed mongoose has narrower feet with more poorly developed pads. In "S. durrelli", the fur is long and soft.
In the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> specimen, a female, the head and body length was , the tail length was , the hindfoot length was , the ear length was , and the body mass was . In another specimen, a male which was captured and released, the head and body length was about , the tail length was about , and the body mass was . Based on these limited data, "S. durrelli" may be slightly smaller than the brown-tailed mongoose.

The skull generally resembles that of the brown-tailed mongoose, but the rostrum (front part) is broad and deep, the <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a>s are broad and short, and the region of the <a href="palate">palate</a> is broad. The <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (lower jaw) is robust and shows a high, steeply rising <a href="coronoid%20process%20of%20the%20mandible">coronoid process</a> (a projection at the back of the bone). Statistical analysis of measurements of the skulls and teeth strongly separates "S. durrelli" from specimens of the brown-tailed mongoose.

"Salanoia durrelli" has a more robust <a href="dentition">dentition</a> than the brown-tailed mongoose; the teeth have larger surface areas. The first and second upper <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s are smaller than the third, which is separated by a pronounced <a href="diastema%20%28dentistry%29">diastema</a> (gap) from the <a href="canine%20tooth">canine tooth</a>. The canine is more robust than in the brown-tailed mongoose. The first upper <a href="premolar">premolar</a> is small, but the second and third are larger; these two teeth are shorter and broader than in the brown-tailed mongoose. The fourth premolar is large, as is the first molar. The second upper molar is less than one-third the size of the first, and is more highly reduced than that of the brown-tailed mongoose, which is about two-thirds the size of the first molar. The first lower incisor is smaller than the other two. The lower canine, premolars, and first molar are well-developed. The second molar is broad, but smaller than in the brown-tailed mongoose.

"Salanoia durrelli" has been recorded at Andreba, a marshy area at above sea level on the eastern coast of Lac Alaotra. The nearest occurrence of the brown-tailed mongoose is about from Alaotra. The first observed specimen was swimming; it may have fled from human activity on the shore. The two others were caught on mats of floating vegetation. Thus, "S. durrelli" occurs in a marsh habitat—quite different from the forest-dwelling brown-tailed mongoose. "S. durrelli" may use its robust dentition to feed on prey with hard parts, such as <a href="crustacea">crustacea</a>ns and <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a>s, in addition to small <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s, rather than the insects that the more gracile-toothed brown-tailed mongoose eats. Indeed, the two specimens of "S. durrelli" were captured using traps baited with fish and meat. "S. durrelli" is similar in many respects to the larger mainland African <a href="marsh%20mongoose">marsh mongoose</a> ("Atilax paludinosa"), a carnivorous wetland-dweller that also uses mats of vegetation to eat and sleep on.

The unique habitat of Lac Alaotra is threatened by pollution, destruction of marshes for the construction of rice fields, overfishing, and <a href="introduced%20species">introduced species</a> such as exotic fish, plants, the <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a> ("Rattus rattus"), and the <a href="small%20Indian%20civet">small Indian civet</a> ("Viverricula indica"), another small carnivoran. A bird restricted to the area, the <a href="Alaotra%20grebe">Alaotra grebe</a> ("Tachybaptus rufolavatus"), was declared extinct in 2010 and the population of the bamboo lemur fell by about 30% from 1994 to 1999. As a narrowly distributed species with a small population, "S. durrelli" is likely to be threatened by degradation of its habitat and perhaps competition with the small Indian civet and the black rat, but its <a href="conservation%20status">conservation status</a> has not yet been formally assessed. The DWCT is working to conserve the Lac Alaotra area and the region has been designated as a <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a>.
