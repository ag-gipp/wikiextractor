The Breeders Tour 2014

The 2014 tour by American <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="the%20Breeders">the Breeders</a> comprised thirteen concerts in the central and western United States in September 2014. The group's lineup for their 1993 album "<a href="Last%20Splash">Last Splash</a>" had consisted of <a href="Josephine%20Wiggs">Josephine Wiggs</a>, Jim Macpherson, <a href="Kim%20Deal">Kim Deal</a>, and <a href="Kelley%20Deal">Kelley Deal</a>; Wiggs and Macpherson were not members for the group's next albums, "<a href="Title%20TK">Title TK</a>" (2002) and "<a href="Mountain%20Battles">Mountain Battles</a>" (2008). In 2013, the 1993 lineup reunited for a tour to commemorate "Last Splash"s 20th anniversary, and the following year began working on new material together. Invited to open for <a href="Neutral%20Milk%20Hotel">Neutral Milk Hotel</a>'s September 18 concert at the <a href="Hollywood%20Bowl">Hollywood Bowl</a>, they planned a tour to lead up to this show, using the opportunity to practice their recent compositions.

Between September 2 and September 17, the Breeders performed in eleven cities, among which were <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>, <a href="Denver">Denver</a>, <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland</a>, <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, and <a href="Las%20Vegas">Las Vegas</a>. Support bands the Funs and the Neptunas opened for them at five and six of these shows, respectively. The group then played at the Hollywood Bowl concert, and finished the tour on September 20 at the Goose Island 312 Urban Block Party event in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>. As well as their new songs, they performed numerous selections from "Last Splash" and "<a href="Pod%20%28The%20Breeders%20album%29">Pod</a>" (1990). The tour received good reviews from <a href="music%20criticism">critics</a>; appraisal included comments that the performances were rousing, and that the band was as good as—or better than—in its heyday.

In 1993, <a href="the%20Breeders">the Breeders</a> released their second album, "<a href="Last%20Splash">Last Splash</a>". At this time, the group's lineup consisted of sisters <a href="Kim%20Deal">Kim</a> and <a href="Kelley%20Deal">Kelley Deal</a> on guitar and vocals, <a href="Josephine%20Wiggs">Josephine Wiggs</a> on bass and vocals, and Jim Macpherson on drums. "Last Splash" was successful in various countries worldwide, and the group toured extensively and played at <a href="Lollapalooza">Lollapalooza 1994</a>. In November 1994, Kelley Deal was arrested on drug-related charges, and in 1995, Wiggs left to pursue other musical projects. Macpherson continued playing with Kim Deal in her side-project group, <a href="the%20Amps">the Amps</a>, and then in the 1996 incarnation of the Breeders, but quit the band in 1997. The Breeders' lineups for their albums "<a href="Title%20TK">Title TK</a>" (2002) and "<a href="Mountain%20Battles">Mountain Battles</a>" (2008) included the Deal sisters, Mando Lopez, and <a href="Jose%20Medeles">Jose Medeles</a>. In 2013, Wiggs and Macpherson rejoined the Deals to tour the 20th anniversary of "Last Splash"—the LSXX Tour.

On December 31, 2013, the Breeders performed their final concert on the 60-date tour in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a>. The group enjoyed the LSXX concerts, and decided they would like to record new music together. Throughout 2014, Wiggs traveled from her home in <a href="Brooklyn%2C%20New%20York">Brooklyn, New York</a> to <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>, near where Macpherson and both Deals lived. The group began practicing new material in Kim Deal's basement, including compositions by her and one by Wiggs. By August, there were three new songs they could play well, two less so, and others they had not yet practiced. Reported titles were "Skinhead #2", "Simone", "All Nerve", and "Launched". The band <a href="Neutral%20Milk%20Hotel">Neutral Milk Hotel</a> asked the Breeders to open for them at a <a href="Hollywood%20Bowl">Hollywood Bowl</a> concert to be held on September 18. The latter decided to go on tour leading up to this show and to perform some new compositions in preparation for their eventual recording.

The September 2014 tour comprised thirteen American dates, all in western and central states. At various shows—between which the Breeders traveled by van—the Funs, the Neptunas, and <a href="Kelley%20Stoltz">Kelley Stoltz</a> were the opening acts. The tour began in early September with dates in <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a> and <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, and then continued west to <a href="Denver">Denver</a>, <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City">Salt Lake City</a>, and <a href="Garden%20City%2C%20Idaho">Garden City, Idaho</a>. On September 10, the Breeders started a short Pacific Coast stretch, performing in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland</a>, and <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>. These were followed by <a href="Las%20Vegas">Las Vegas</a> and <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix</a>, then west again to <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, leading up to their concert on September 18 at the Hollywood Bowl with Neutral Milk Hotel and <a href="Daniel%20Johnston">Daniel Johnston</a>. Breeder's Digest, their official online fan magazine, announced <a href="Carrie%20Bradley">Carrie Bradley</a>'s reunion with the band for this show. Following the Hollywood concert, the Breeders finished their tour at the Goose Island 312 Urban Block Party event in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> on September 20, with groups such as <a href="Unknown%20Mortal%20Orchestra">Unknown Mortal Orchestra</a> and <a href="Thao%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Get%20Down%20Stay%20Down">Thao & the Get Down Stay Down</a>.

In addition to the new compositions "Simone", "Skinhead #2", "All Nerve", and "Launched", the Breeders performed many songs from their albums "<a href="Pod%20%28The%20Breeders%20album%29">Pod</a>" (1990) and "Last Splash". Among these were "<a href="Saints%20%28song%29">Saints</a>", "<a href="Cannonball%20%28The%20Breeders%20song%29">Cannonball</a>", "<a href="No%20Aloha">No Aloha</a>", and "<a href="Divine%20Hammer%20%28song%29">Divine Hammer</a>" from "Last Splash", as well as "Doe", "<a href="Happiness%20Is%20a%20Warm%20Gun">Happiness Is a Warm Gun</a>", and "Iris" from "Pod". They also played "<a href="Off%20You">Off You</a>" from "Title TK" and the title track from the "<a href="Safari%20%28EP%29">Safari</a>" <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a> (1992). Another composition they performed was "Walking with a Killer", which had originally been released—with the <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">B-side</a> "Dirty Hessians"—as the first in a series of solo <a href="Gramophone%20record%23Formats">7" singles</a> by Kim Deal, and which the Breeders had played in 2013 on their LSXX Tour.

The band's performances on the 2014 tour were generally well received. Regarding their September 3 concert in Kansas City, Danny Phillips of <a href="Blurt%20%28magazine%29">Blurt</a> wrote that the Breeders "like wine, seem to improve with age", adding that nothing about the show could have been better; "<a href="The%20Kansas%20City%20Star">The Kansas City Star</a>"s Timothy Finn likewise summed the night up as "an evening that exceeded its promise". Critic Lissa Townsend Rodgers of the Vegas Seven website commended their rousing performances of "New Year" and "Cannonball" at their Las Vegas concert on September 16—a show also enjoyed by Leslie Ventura of "<a href="Las%20Vegas%20Weekly">Las Vegas Weekly</a>", who noted the confidence with which the band played. Reviewing the September 17 date in San Diego, critic Alex Packard of Listensd.com opined that the Breeders "deliver[ed] the classics like they wrote them yesterday and new material in no less of a moving way". Both Keith Plocek of "<a href="LA%20Weekly">LA Weekly</a>" and Philip Cosores of "<a href="Consequence%20of%20Sound">Consequence of Sound</a>" liked the September 18 concert at the Hollywood Bowl; Cosores rated a few of the performances as impeccable, and commented that Kim Deal's "rock and roll soul is still as strong as ever".

<a href="Tim%20Hinely">Tim Hinely</a>, also of Blurt, wrote that although the Breeders’ showing in Denver on September 5 could by no means be considered first rate, it was nonetheless enjoyable; in Portland on September 11, <a href="KNRK">94/7</a>'s Yume Delegato heard the group's performance as appealingly unpolished and heartfelt, but asserted that some of the new songs did not leave a strong impression.

Battle of Malvern Hill

The Battle of Malvern Hill, also known as the Battle of Poindexter's Farm, was fought on July 1, 1862, between the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> <a href="Army%20of%20Northern%20Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a>, led by <a href="General%20%28CSA%29">Gen.</a> <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>, and the <a href="Union%20%28Civil%20War%29">Union</a> <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a> under <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Maj. Gen.</a> <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan">George B. McClellan</a>. It was the final battle of the <a href="Seven%20Days%20Battles">Seven Days Battles</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, taking place on a elevation of land known as <a href="Malvern%20Hill">Malvern Hill</a>, near the Confederate capital of <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a> and just one mile (1.6 km) from the <a href="James%20River">James River</a>. Including inactive reserves, more than fifty thousand soldiers from each side took part, using more than two hundred pieces of artillery and three warships.

The Seven Days Battles were the climax of the <a href="Peninsula%20Campaign">Peninsula Campaign</a>, during which McClellan's Army of the Potomac sailed around the Confederate lines, landed at the tip of the <a href="Virginia%20Peninsula">Virginia Peninsula</a>, southeast of Richmond, and struck inland towards the Confederate capital. Confederate <a href="commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a> <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a> fended off McClellan's repeated attempts to take the city, slowing Union progress on the peninsula to a crawl. When Johnston was wounded, Lee took command and launched a series of counterattacks, collectively called the Seven Days Battles. These attacks culminated in the action on Malvern Hill.

The Union's <a href="V%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">V Corps</a>, commanded by <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brig. Gen.</a> <a href="Fitz%20John%20Porter">Fitz John Porter</a>, took up positions on the hill on June30. McClellan was not present for the initial exchanges of the battle, having boarded the <a href="ironclad">ironclad</a> <a href="USS%20Galena%20%281862%29">USS "Galena"</a> and sailed down the James River to inspect <a href="Harrison%27s%20Landing">Harrison's Landing</a>, where he intended to locate the base for his army. Confederate preparations were hindered by several mishaps. Bad maps and faulty guides caused Confederate <a href="Major%20General%20%28CSA%29">Maj. Gen.</a> <a href="John%20B.%20Magruder">John Magruder</a> to be late for the battle, an excess of caution delayed Maj. Gen. <a href="Benjamin%20Huger%20%28general%29">Benjamin Huger</a>, and Maj. Gen. <a href="Stonewall%20Jackson">Stonewall Jackson</a> had problems collecting the Confederate artillery.

The battle occurred in stages: an initial exchange of artillery fire, a minor charge by Confederate <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28CSA%29">Brig. Gen.</a> <a href="Lewis%20Armistead">Lewis Armistead</a>, and three successive waves of Confederate infantry charges triggered by unclear orders from Lee and the actions of Maj. Gens. Magruder and <a href="D.%20H.%20Hill">D. H. Hill</a>, respectively. In each phase, the effectiveness of the Federal artillery was the deciding factor, repulsing attack after attack, resulting in a tactical Union victory. After the battle, McClellan and his forces withdrew from Malvern Hill to Harrison's Landing, where he remained until August 16. His plan to capture Richmond had been thwarted. In the course of four hours, a series of blunders in planning and communication had caused Lee's forces to launch three failed frontal infantry assaults across hundreds of yards of open ground, unsupported by Confederate artillery, charging toward firmly entrenched Union infantry and artillery defenses. These errors provided Union forces with an opportunity to inflict heavy casualties. In the aftermath of the battle, however, the Confederate press heralded Lee as the savior of Richmond. In stark contrast, McClellan was accused of being absent from the battlefield, a harsh criticism that haunted him when he <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201864">ran for president in 1864</a>.

In spring 1862, Union commander Maj. Gen. <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan">George B. McClellan</a> developed an ambitious plan to capture <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a>, the Confederate capital, on the <a href="Virginia%20Peninsula">Virginia Peninsula</a>. His 121,500-man <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a>, along with 14,592 animals, 1,224 wagons and ambulances, and 44 artillery batteries, would load onto 389 vessels and sail to the tip of the peninsula at <a href="Fort%20Monroe">Fort Monroe</a>, then move inland and capture the capital. The bold and sweeping landing was executed with few incidents, but the Federals were delayed for about a month in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Yorktown%20%281862%29">Siege of Yorktown</a>. When McClellan's army finally did attack on May4, the defensive earthworks around Yorktown were undefended. After some hours, the Army of the Potomac pursued the retreating Confederates. When Union troops encountered the Confederate rearguard at <a href="Williamsburg%2C%20Virginia">Williamsburg</a>, the two armies fought an inconclusive <a href="Battle%20of%20Williamsburg">battle</a>. The Confederates continued their withdrawal that night. To stymie the Southerners' retreat, McClellan sent Brig. Gen. <a href="William%20Farrar%20Smith">William F. "Baldy" Smith</a> to Eltham's Landing by boat, resulting in a <a href="Battle%20of%20Eltham%27s%20Landing">battle</a> there on May7. When the Union Army tried to attack Richmond by way of the James River, they were turned back at <a href="Battle%20of%20Drewry%27s%20Bluff">Drewry's Bluff</a> on May15. All the while, McClellan continued his pursuit of Confederate forces, who were withdrawing quickly towards Richmond.

The lack of decisive action on the Virginia Peninsula spurred President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> to order McClellan's army to move into positions close to Richmond. By May30, McClellan had begun moving troops across the <a href="Chickahominy%20River">Chickahominy River</a>, the only major natural barrier that separated his army from Richmond. However, heavy rains and thunderstorms on the night of May30 caused the water level to swell, washing away two bridges and splitting the Federal army in two across the Chickahominy. In the subsequent <a href="Battle%20of%20Seven%20Pines">Battle of Seven Pines</a>, Confederate general-in-chief <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a> sought to capitalize on the bifurcation of McClellan's army, attacking the half of the Union Army that was stuck south of the river. Johnston's plan fell apart, and McClellan lost no ground. Late in the battle, Johnston was hit in the right shoulder by a bullet and in the chest by a shell fragment; his command went to Maj. Gen. <a href="Gustavus%20W.%20Smith">Gustavus W. Smith</a>. Smith's tenure as commander of the Army of Northern Virginia was short. On June1, after an unsuccessful attack on Union forces, <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a>, the <a href="President%20of%20the%20Confederacy">President of the Confederacy</a>, appointed <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>, his own military adviser, to replace Smith as the commander-in-chief of the Confederate armies.

The subsequent two weeks on the peninsula were mostly quiet. On June25, though, a surprise attack by McClellan began a series of six major battles over the next week near Richmond—the <a href="Seven%20Days%20Battles">Seven Days Battles</a>. On the first day, as Lee led the Army of Northern Virginia toward the Union lines, McClellan preempted him with an attack at <a href="Battle%20of%20Oak%20Grove">Oak Grove</a>. Lee's men successfully warded off the Union assault, and Lee continued with his plans. The next morning, the Confederates attacked the Army of the Potomac at <a href="Battle%20of%20Mechanicsville">Mechanicsville</a>. Union forces turned back the Confederate onslaught, inflicting heavy losses. After Mechanicsville, McClellan's army withdrew to a position behind Boatswain's Swamp. There, on June27, the Union soldiers suffered another Confederate attack, this time at Gaines's Mill. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gaines%27s%20Mill">resulting battle</a>, the Confederates launched numerous failed charges, until a final concerted attack broke the Union line, resulting in the only clear Confederate victory during the Seven Days. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Garnett%27s%20and%20Golding%27s%20Farms">action at Garnett's and Golding's Farm</a>, fought next, was merely a set of skirmishes. Lee attacked the Union Army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Savage%27s%20Station">Battle of Savage's Station</a> on June29 and the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Glendale">Glendale</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20White%20Oak%20Swamp">White Oak Swamp</a> June30, but all three battles were inconclusive. After this series of conflicts that inflicted thousands of casualties on both armies, McClellan began to position his forces to an imposing natural position atop <a href="Malvern%20Hill">Malvern Hill</a>.

Malvern Hill, a plateau-like elevation in <a href="Henrico%20County%2C%20Virginia">Henrico County, Virginia</a>, provided an impressive natural military position about two miles (3.2 km) north of the James River. The hill rose some to its crest to form a crescent about in length and wide. Its slope was about in length and very gradual, with only one or two notable depressions. Along the western side of the hill ran Malvern Cliffs, a bluff-like formation that overlooked Turkey Run, a tributary of nearby Turkey Island Creek. Western Run was another tributary of Turkey Island Creek, which lay mostly along the eastern side of the hill and slanted slightly into the northern side. One depression dipped some at the valley of Western Run and slanted upwards to the plateau. Malvern Hill's center was slightly lower than the flanks. The gentle, bare slant meant that any assailing army could not easily take cover, and artillery would have the benefit of a clear, open field.
Several farms were positioned near Malvern Hill. Roughly north of the hill were the Poindexter and Carter farms. Between the two farms was a swampy and thickly wooded area that made up the course of Western Run. The largest in the area was the Mellert family's farm, usually called the Crew farm for a former owner, situated at the western side of the hill. About a quarter of a mile due east of Malvern Hill was the West farm. Between these two farms lay the Willis Church Road, which some locals called the Quaker Road. This road also ran past the Malvern house, the hill's namesake, which was perched atop the southern edge of the plateau. "It was, altogether, an exceedingly formidable position", wrote historian <a href="Douglas%20Southall%20Freeman">Douglas Southall Freeman</a>. "Had the Union engineers searched the whole countryside below Richmond, they could not have found ground more ideally set for the slaughter of an attacking army."

A few days prior to the action on Malvern Hill, McClellan incorrectly believed that the Army of the Potomac was vastly outnumbered by its Confederate foe, and his fear of being cut off from his supply depot left him cautious and wary. On the night of June28, McClellan told his generals that he intended to move his army to a position on the north bank of the James River called <a href="Harrison%27s%20Landing">Harrison's Landing</a>, where they would be protected by Union gunboats. The Army of the Potomac came to Malvern Hill, the army's final stop before reaching the Landing, with approximately 54,000 men.

On the morning of June30, 1862, the Union <a href="V%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">V Corps</a> under <a href="Fitz%20John%20Porter">Fitz John Porter</a>, a part of McClellan's Army of the Potomac, amassed atop Malvern Hill. <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Col.</a> <a href="Henry%20Jackson%20Hunt">Henry Hunt</a>, McClellan's skilled chief of artillery, posted 171 guns on the hill and 91 more in reserve in the south. The artillery line on the hill's slope consisted of eight <a href="artillery%20battery">batteries</a> of <a href="field%20artillery">field artillery</a> with 37 guns. Brig. Gen. <a href="George%20Sykes">George Sykes</a>'s division would guard the line. In reserve were additional field artillery and three batteries of <a href="heavy%20artillery">heavy artillery</a>, which included five 4.5-inch (11 cm) <a href="Rodman%20gun">Rodman gun</a>s, five 20-pounder (9.1 kg) <a href="Parrott%20rifles">Parrott rifles</a> and six 32-pounder (15 kg) <a href="howitzers">howitzers</a>. As more of McClellan's forces arrived at the hill, Porter continued to reinforce the Union line. Brig. Gen. <a href="George%20W.%20Morell">George Morell</a>'s units, stationed between the Crew and West farms, extended the line to the northeastern section. Brig. Gen. <a href="Darius%20N.%20Couch">Darius Couch</a>'s division of the <a href="IV%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">IV Corps</a>, as yet unbloodied by the skirmishes of the Seven Days, further extended the northeastern line. This left 17,800 soldiers from Couch's and Morell's divisions at the northern face of the hill, overlooking the Quaker Road, from which the Federals expected Lee's forces to attack.

Early the next day, Tuesday, July 1, McClellan, having come from nearby Haxall's Landing the night before, examined his army's battle line on Malvern Hill. His inspection left him worried most about the Union Army's right (eastern) flank, which lay behind Western Run. Western Run was an area necessary for McClellan's plans to relocate to Harrison's Landing, and he feared an attack might come from there. As a result, he posted the largest portion of his army there: two divisions from <a href="Edwin%20Vose%20Sumner">Edwin Sumner</a>'s <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">II Corps</a>, two divisions from Brig. Gen. <a href="Samuel%20P.%20Heintzelman">Samuel P. Heintzelman</a>'s <a href="III%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">III Corps</a>, two divisions from Brig. Gen. <a href="William%20B.%20Franklin">William Franklin</a>'s <a href="VI%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">VI Corps</a> and one division from Maj. Gen. <a href="Erasmus%20Keyes">Erasmus Keyes</a>'s IV Corps, who were stationed across the James. The division under Brig. Gen. <a href="George%20A.%20McCall">George McCall</a>, badly mangled in the fighting at Glendale and having lost McCall and two of its three brigadiers, was held in general reserve.

McClellan did not believe his army was ready for a battle, and hoped that Lee would not give them one. Nonetheless, he left his troops at Malvern Hill and traveled downstream aboard the ironclad <a href="USS%20Galena%20%281862%29">USS "Galena"</a> to inspect his army's future resting place at Harrison's Landing. McClellan did not delegate an interim commander; Porter, who was in command during the initial attack, became the de facto leader on the Union side of the battle.

With around 55,000 soldiers, the Army of Northern Virginia was about evenly matched with the Federals, and with Lee at the helm, notably more aggressive. He wanted a final, decisive attack that would effectively scatter the Federals. Several pieces of evidence—abandoned <a href="Commissary%20%28store%29">commissary stores</a>, wagons and arms, and the hundreds of Union stragglers and deserters his units had happened upon and captured—led Lee to conclude that the Army of the Potomac was demoralized and retreating. In all the battles up to Malvern Hill, Lee's plans to destroy the Federal army had failed for one reason or another. Though he was undeterred, his chances for decisive victory were diminishing quickly.

Early on the morning of the battle, Lee met with his lieutenants, including Maj. Gens. <a href="James%20Longstreet">James Longstreet</a>, <a href="A.%20P.%20Hill">A. P. Hill</a>, <a href="Stonewall%20Jackson">Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson</a>, John Magruder and <a href="D.%20H.%20Hill">D. H. Hill</a>. D. H. Hill, after talking with a <a href="chaplain">chaplain</a> familiar with the geography of Malvern Hill, cautioned against mounting an attack. "If General McClellan is there in strength," Hill said, "we had better let him alone." Longstreet laughed off Hill's objections, saying "Don't get so scared, now that we've got him [McClellan] whipped."

Lee chose the relatively well-rested commands of D. H. Hill, Stonewall Jackson and John Magruder to lead the Confederate offensive, as they had barely participated in the fighting of the day before. James Longstreet and A.P. Hill's divisions were held in reserve as they were in no condition to fight after Glendale, with almost half their officers and close to a quarter of the enlisted men killed or wounded. Brig. Gen <a href="Winfield%20Featherston">Winfield Featherston</a>'s brigade was temporarily commanded by Brig. Gen <a href="George%20B.%20Anderson">George B. Anderson</a> of D.H. Hill's division, as there was nobody left in the brigade above the rank of major. According to Lee's plan, the Army of Northern Virginia would form a semi-circle enveloping Malvern Hill. D. H. Hill's five brigades would be placed along the northern face of the hill, forming the center of the Confederate line, and the commands of Stonewall Jackson and John Magruder would take the left and right flanks, respectively. Whiting's forces would position themselves on the Poindexter farm, with the outfits of Brig. Gen. <a href="Charles%20Sidney%20Winder">Charles Sidney Winder</a> and Richard Ewell nearby. The infantry of these three detachments would provide reinforcement for the Confederate line if necessary. Two veteran generals rejoined the Army of Northern Virginia for the battle, Brig. Gen <a href="Wade%20Hampton%20III">Wade Hampton</a> and Brig. Gen <a href="Jubal%20Early">Jubal Early</a>, both wounded two months earlier. Hampton and Early were given command of two of Jackson's brigades that had lost their commanders at <a href="Gaines%20Mill">Gaines Mill</a> and had only inexperienced colonels to lead them. Maj. Gen. <a href="Theophilus%20Holmes">Theophilus Holmes</a> would take up a position on the extreme Confederate right flank.

The Army of the Potomac's disposition in the lead-up to the battle was more orderly than Lee's Army of Northern Virginia; all of McClellan's forces would be concentrated in one place, save for Erasmus Keyes and one of his two divisions, which were stationed across the James River. A Confederate scout observed Union soldiers resting in position, and moving about the hill unworried, whilst the disposition of the cannons around the hill's slope gave him the impression that the position was "almost impregnable". McClellan's army was on the hill in force.
Throughout the Seven Days Battles, Lee's forces had been separated and scattered due to swamps, narrow roads and other geographic obstacles, and occasionally due to unclear orders. As the days of marching and fighting wore on the number of stragglers swelled to fill narrow roads and significantly deplete the Confederate ranks, presenting a significant additional strain on their combat readiness. These hindrances continued during the Battle of Malvern Hill, with both Magruder and Huger making mistakes in the deployment of their forces.

At first, Magruder's units were behind Stonewall Jackson's column while marching down the Long Bridge Road, which led to Malvern Hill. Along this road were several adjoining pathways. One such road, called the Willis Church Road by some locals and the Quaker Road by others, led south from Glendale to Malvern Hill. Lee's maps labeled this "Quaker Road". Another of these paths began near a local farm and angled southwest toward an upriver point on the River Road—some locals called this the Quaker Road, including Magruder's guides, who led Magruder's army down this road rather than the Quaker Road shown on Lee's maps. James Longstreet eventually rode after Magruder, and persuaded him to reverse course. This incident delayed Magruder's arrival to the battlefield for three hours.

Huger, worried about clashing with Union forces while marching towards Malvern Hill, had also failed to manage his division effectively. He deployed two of his brigades, commanded by Brig. Gens. <a href="Lewis%20Armistead">Lewis Armistead</a> and <a href="Ambrose%20R.%20Wright">Ambrose Wright</a>, to perform a <a href="flanking%20maneuver">flanking maneuver</a> around any Federals they found, to avoid the Union threat. Longstreet eventually notified Huger that he would be unobstructed by Federal forces if he marched to Malvern Hill. Huger, however, remained in place until someone from Lee's headquarters came to guide them to the battlefield.

As noon drew near with no sight of either Huger or Magruder, who were supposed to be manning the Confederate right flank, Lee replaced these two forces with the smaller units of Brig. Gens. Armistead and Wright, two of Huger's brigades that had reached the battlefield some time earlier. Huger and his other two brigades (under Brig. Gens. Ransom and Mahone) were still too far north of the scene. Despite the mishaps and disunity, Malvern Hill would be the first time during the Seven Days Battles that Lee managed to <a href="Force%20concentration">concentrate</a> his force.

Lee surveyed the left flank himself for possible artillery positions. After a <a href="reconnoitering">reconnoitering</a> expedition on the right flank, James Longstreet returned to Lee; the two compared their results and concluded that two <a href="grand%20battery">grand battery</a>-like positions would be established at the left and right sides of Malvern Hill. The converging artillery fire from the batteries, they reasoned, could weaken the Union line so that a Confederate infantry attack could break through. If this plan did not work out, Lee and Longstreet felt the artillery fire would buy them time to consider other plans.

With a battle plan in order, Lee sent a draft to his lieutenants, written by his chief of staff, Col. <a href="Robert%20H.%20Chilton">Robert Chilton</a> "(see right box)." The orders were not well-crafted, however, since they designated the yell of a single charging brigade as the only signal of attack for a full fifteen brigades. Amid the tumult and clamor of battle, this was bound to create confusion. Moreover, Chilton's draft effectively left the attack solely at the discretion of Lewis Armistead, who had never before held command of a brigade during battle. The draft also did not note the time that it had been written, which later caused confusion for Magruder.

Beginning around 1 pm, Union artillery fired first, initially upon infantry in the woods, and later upon any Confederate artillery that attempted to move into firing position. On the Confederate left flank, two batteries from Whiting's division and one from Jackson's soon began firing from their position upon Darius Couch's division of the IV Corps, who were near the center of the Union line. This began a fierce firefight, with the Union's eight batteries and 37 guns concentrated against three Confederate batteries and sixteen guns. The Union fire silenced the Rowan Artillery and made their position untenable. The other two Confederate batteries, placed by Jackson himself, were in somewhat better positions, and managed to keep firing. Over a period of more than three hours, a total of six or eight Confederate batteries engaged the Union Army from the Confederate left flank, but they were usually engaged only one at a time.

On the Confederate right flank a total of six batteries engaged the Federals, but they did so one-by-one instead of in unison, and each was consecutively cut to pieces by concentrated Union artillery fire. Moreover, they engaged the Union artillery later than the guns of the left flank, so the desired crossfire bombardment was never achieved.
In all, the Confederate artillery barrage on both flanks completely failed to achieve its objectives. Confederate fire did manage to kill <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%29">Capt.</a> John E. Beam of the Union's 1st New Jersey Artillery, along with a few others, and several Federal batteries (though none that were actually engaged) had to move to avoid the fire. Although the barrage by Lee's forces did claim a few lives, Union forces remained unfazed and continued their fearsome barrage. Indeed, Union Army Lt. Charles B. Haydon supposedly fell asleep during the artillery fight. On both the left and right flanks, several of the batteries that did engage lasted no more than minutes before being rendered incapable of fire. Moreover, in a failure of command that, according to historian Thomas M. Settles, must ultimately be placed on Lee's shoulders, the movements of the two flanks were never coordinated with one another. D. H. Hill found the failure of the Confederate artillery discouraging and later dismissed the barrage as "most farcical".

Meanwhile, the Union artillery fire was planned and directed nearly flawlessly. As historian Jennings Cropper Wise notes, Col. Hunt, McClellan's chief of artillery, continuously refocused Union fire on various fronts, in an "enormous sheaf of fire of more than 50 superior pieces, disabling four of Huger's and several of Jackson's batteries almost the instant they came into action". This severely hampered the Confederates' ability to respond effectively to the Federal barrage. The Union artillery subdued a number of the Southerners' batteries; those few that remained attacked piecemeal, and failed to produce any significant result.

Intense Confederate and especially Union artillery fire continued for at least an hour, slackening at about 2:30pm. At about 3:30pm, Lewis Armistead noticed Union skirmishers creeping towards his men where the grand battery on the Confederate right flank was, nearly within rifle range of them. Armistead sent three regiments (about half of his brigade) from his command to push back the skirmishers, thus beginning the infantry part of the battle. The skirmishers were repelled quickly, but Armistead's men found themselves in the midst of an intense Union barrage. The Confederates decided to nestle themselves in a ravine along the hill's slant. This position protected them from the fire, but pinned them down on the slopes of Malvern Hill, unsupported by either infantry or artillery. They did not have enough men to advance any further and retreating would have put them back into the crossfire.

Not long after the advance of Armistead's regiments, John Magruder and his men arrived near the battlefield, albeit quite late because of the confusion regarding the names of local roads—by this time, it was 4pm. Magruder was told at that morning's war council to move to Huger's right, but he was unaware of Huger's position, and sent Major Joseph L. Brent to locate Huger's right flank. Brent found Huger, who said that he had no idea where his brigades were. Huger was noticeably upset that his men had been given orders by someone other than himself; Lee had told Huger's two brigades under Armistead and Ambrose Wright to advance to the right part of the Confederate line. Upon hearing of this, Magruder was quite confused. He sent Capt. A. G. Dickinson to find Lee and inform him of the "successful" charge of Armistead's men and request further orders. Contrary to this message, Armistead was in fact pinned down halfway up Malvern Hill. At the same time, Whiting sent Lee an incorrect report that Union forces were retreating. Whiting had mistaken two events for a Federal withdrawal—the movement of Edwin Sumner's troops, who were adjusting their position to avoid the Confederate fire, and the relaxing of Union fire on his side, which was actually the Union artillery concentrating their firepower to a different front. Whiting and Magruder's erroneous reports led Lee to send a draft of orders to Magruder via Dickinson: "General Lee expects you to advance rapidly", wrote Dickinson. "He says it is reported that the enemy is [retreating]. Press forward your whole line and follow up Armistead's success." Before Dickinson returned with these orders, Magruder was belatedly handed the order sent out three hours previously (at 1:30 pm) by Chilton. Since no time was affixed to the text of the orders, Magruder was unaware that these orders had been rendered meaningless by the failure of the Confederate artillery during the past few hours, and believed he had received two successive orders from Lee to attack.
Believing himself bound by Lee's order to charge, but with his own brigades not yet in attacking position, Magruder mustered some five thousand men from Huger's brigades, including those of Ambrose Wright and Maj. Gen. <a href="William%20Mahone">William Mahone</a> and half of the men from Armistead's brigade who were caught in the open battlefield. Magruder had also sent for Brig. Gen. <a href="Robert%20Ransom%2C%20Jr.">Robert Ransom, Jr.</a>, also under Huger's command, who noted that he had been given strict instructions to ignore any orders not originating from Huger, and apologetically said he could not help Magruder. Magruder additionally ordered men under his personal command—three regiments of Brig. Gen. <a href="Howell%20Cobb">Howell Cobb</a>'s brigade, plus Col. <a href="William%20Barksdale">William Barksdale</a>'s full brigade—to the attack. Because of the confusion regarding Quaker Road, however, these brigades were not yet near enough to do more than move into supporting position, and Magruder wanted to attack immediately. Despite this, under Magruder's order at about 5:30pm, Wright's brigade with Armistead's, then Mahone's brigade, started darting out of the woods and towards the Union line. The artillery of the Confederate left flank, under Jackson's personal command, also renewed their barrage with the late arrival of two batteries of Richard Ewell's division. The Confederates were initially engaged solely by Union sharpshooters, but the latter quickly fell back to give their own artillery a clear field of fire. Antipersonnel <a href="canister%20shot">canister shot</a> was employed with deadly effect. Wright's men were pinned down in a small depression on the rolling hillside, to the right of Armistead's; Mahone's were driven back into retreat in about the same area. At some point during the first wave of assaults, Cobb moved into close supporting position behind Armistead. Barksdale's men were also supporting, to the left of Armistead.

The firefight also alerted the three Union boats on the James—the ironclad USS "Galena", and the gunboats <a href="USS%20Jacob%20Bell">USS "Jacob Bell"</a> and <a href="USS%20Aroostook%20%281861%29">USS "Aroostook"</a>—which began lobbing missiles in length and in diameter from their position on the James River onto the battlefield. The explosions and impacts of the gunboat fire impressed the Confederate troops, but the guns' aim was unreliable, and the large shells did considerably less damage than might have been expected.

D. H. Hill had been discouraged by the failure of the Confederate artillery, and asked Stonewall Jackson to supplement Chilton's draft. Jackson's response was that Hill should obey the original orders: charge with a <a href="Rebel%20yell">yell</a> after Armistead's brigade. No yell was heard for hours, and Hill's men began building <a href="bivouac%20shelter">bivouac shelter</a>s to sleep in. Around 6 pm, Hill and his five brigade commanders had assumed that the lack of a signal meant that their army would not attempt any assault. They were conferring together about Chilton's order when they heard yells and the commotion of a charge from their right flank, roughly where Armistead was supposed to be. Hill took the yell as the signal and shouted to his commanders, "That must be the general advance. Bring up your brigades as soon as possible and join in it." D. H. Hill's five brigades, with some 8,200 men, had to contend with the dense woodlands around the Quaker Road and Western Run, which destroyed any order they may have had. Men advanced out of the woods towards the Union line in five separate, uncoordinated attacks, and each brigade charged up the hill alone: "We crossed one fence, went through another piece of woods, then over another fence [and] into an open field on the other side of which was a long line of Yankees", wrote William Calder of the 2nd Regiment, North Carolina Infantry. "Our men charged gallantly at them. The enemy mowed us down by fifties." Some brigades in Hill's division made it close enough to exchange musket fire and engage in hand-to-hand combat, but these were driven back. The artillery response on the Federal side to Hill's charge was particularly withering, and soon, Hill's men needed support just to hold their ground. In "Extraordinary Circumstances: The Seven Days Battles", Brian K. Burton called Hill's charge "unnecessary and costly." The successive assaults of Hill's brigades on the well-entrenched Federals were short-lived, and achieved little.

Preceding attacks by Lee's army had done barely anything to accomplish Confederate objectives, but this did not deter Magruder, who rode back and forth across the battlefield, calling for reinforcements and personally launching unit after unit into a charge of the Union line. At this point, men who had always been directly under Magruder's command began to join the battle. Magruder first encountered some units of Brig. Gen. <a href="Robert%20Toombs">Robert Toombs</a>. With Toombs's brigade widely dispersed, the individual units Magruder found were not with Toombs himself. Magruder personally led the men in a short-lived charge, followed by a disordered retreat. Other units nominally under Toombs's command appeared, charged and retreated at various times throughout the next few hours, with little or no organization. The brigades of Col. <a href="George%20T.%20Anderson">George T. Anderson</a> and Col. William Barksdale emerged from the woods to the right of Toombs, but as they did so, Anderson's men also became separated, as the left side outpaced the right. This created an advance with two of Anderson's regiments on the far Confederate left next to Toombs, Barksdale's men in the middle, and three more Anderson regiments on the far right, near the remnants of Wright and Mahone. Anderson's right flank charged, but made it no farther than the foot of the hill before breaking and retreating under a hail of antipersonnel artillery. Anderson's left flank never charged. Barksdale's brigade charged at roughly the same time, and made it considerably farther up the hill, engaging the Union infantry of Brig. Gen. <a href="Daniel%20Butterfield">Daniel Butterfield</a> in a firefight that lasted more than an hour.

Lee received Magruder's calls for reinforcement and instructed Huger to let Ransom go support the men trapped on the field of battle. He also sent orders to the brigades of Brig. Gens. <a href="Joseph%20B.%20Kershaw">Joseph B. Kershaw</a> and <a href="Paul%20Jones%20Semmes">Paul Jones Semmes</a>, in Maj. Gen. <a href="Lafayette%20McLaws">Lafayette McLaws</a>'s division within Magruder's command. Robert Ransom's unit, after they finally showed up with Huger's permission, first attempted to charge straight up the hill, following the path of other Confederate brigades attempting to aid Magruder. When this proved useless, Ransom ordered them to regroup in the woods to the Confederate right, march double-time a half a mile in a hook to the right around all the other Confederate units and attack the far Union western flank. While Ransom was angling west, Jackson responded to a request for reinforcement from D. H. Hill by sending forward brigades from his own command to move from the east into the area where D. H. Hill had attacked. From his own division Jackson sent Brig. Gens. <a href="Alexander%20Lawton">Alexander Lawton</a> and <a href="Charles%20S.%20Winder">Charles S. Winder</a>, and from Ewell's division, Brig. Gen. <a href="Isaac%20R.%20Trimble">Isaac R. Trimble</a> and Cols. <a href="Leroy%20A.%20Stafford">Leroy A. Stafford</a> and <a href="Jubal%20Early">Jubal Early</a>. Brig. Gen <a href="John%20R.%20Jones">John R. Jones</a> was wounded in the hand and command of his brigade went to Lt. Col Richard Cunningham of the 48th Virginia, who had commanded the brigade a few days earlier while Jones was on sick leave.

Ransom's men managed to come closer to the Union line than any Confederates that day, guided by the flashing light of the cannons amidst an encroaching darkness; however, George Sykes's artillery repelled that attack. The brigades of Kershaw and Semmes, sent earlier by Lee, arrived to the front while Ransom was moving to attack in another position. Semmes and Kershaw were quickly sent in; they too were repulsed not long after. Semmes was west of the junction of Carter's Mill Road and Willis Church Road, in the vicinity of Barksdale, Mahone and Wright. Semmes made the final charge of the day west of these roads, and like the charges before, it was to little effect. Kershaw angled east, in the area where Toombs, Anderson and Cobb had attacked. This was an area of great confusion. Kershaw's troops arrived ahead of all the reinforcements sent by Jackson, and took fire from both friendly and hostile forces: from Confederates behind them firing wildly and Federals in front firing effectively. Kershaw's men retreated in rout. The brigades behind Kershaw charged incoherently, with some men pushing forward, and others getting separated from their units or confused when they encountered groups of retreating Confederates. Disorganized, retreating soldiers from various units were so numerous that they slowed Jackson's men to nearly a standstill. Jackson's unit commanders attempted to organize their various regiments and rally the retreaters to join in, but it was all to very little effect. A few units fought fiercely against Union infantry and artillery. In particular, three regiments of Barlow's brigade made it close enough to Union lines to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the troops of Brig. Gen. <a href="Daniel%20Sickles">Daniel Sickles</a> before being driven back. As the sun was starting to go down, Brig. Gen <a href="Isaac%20Trimble">Isaac Trimble</a> began to move his brigade forward.
Stonewall Jackson asked him what he was planning to do. "I am going to charge those batteries, sir!" Trimble answered. "I guess you'd better not try it. General D.H. Hill has just tried with his entire division and been repulsed. I guess you'd better not try it." Jackson replied.

Night was falling, however, and eventually all of these troops were ordered to merely hold their positions without charging. In the end, the charges of Semmes and Kershaw were the last coherent Confederate actions, and neither was successful. Brig. Gen. Porter summed up the Confederate infantry charges at Malvern Hill this way:

With the infantry part of the battle over, Union artillery continued to boom across the hill. They stopped firing at 8:30pm, leaving a wreath of smoke upon the crest's edge, and ending the action on Malvern Hill.

The human toll of the Battle of Malvern Hill and the Seven Days Battles was shown clearly as both capitals, Washington and Richmond, set up numerous provisional hospitals to care for the dead, wounded and missing. Ships sailed from the Peninsula to Washington carrying the wounded. Richmond was nearest to the battlefields of the Seven Days, and the immense number of casualties overwhelmed hospitals and doctors. People from about the Confederacy descended upon Richmond to care for the conflict's casualties. Graves could not be dug quickly enough.

The Confederates counted some 5,650 casualties. Some 30,000 Confederates engaged that day, though several thousand more endured the Union shelling. Whiting's unit suffered 175 casualties in the Malvern Hill conflict, even though they had limited involvement in the assaults. Charles Winder's brigade of just over 1,000 men suffered 104 casualties in their short involvement in the battle. D. H. Hill spent days removing the wounded, burying the dead and cleaning up the battlefield, with help from Magruder and Huger's units. One of D. H. Hill's brigades lost 41% of its strength at Malvern Hill alone. He later estimated that more than half of all the Confederate killed and wounded at Malvern Hill were as a result of artillery fire. Two Confederate generals were wounded, Brig. Gens George B. Anderson and John R. Jones. No Union officers above the regimental level were killed or wounded.

The battle on Malvern Hill was a resounding Union tactical victory. The victory was due in no small part to Henry Hunt, the Union chief artillerist, who did proficient work in accumulating and concentrating the Union guns. Troop placement before the battle by the army's principal topographical engineer, Col. A. A. Humphreys, was also carried out capably. The ground on Malvern Hill was used effectively and the Union line had depth with a healthy amount of rested troops available to defend it. Fitz John Porter, the de facto commander for the day, played an important role in this. He posted his men well on June30, and stationed reinforcements near to the Union line. Darius Couch, whose forces comprised half of the Union center, positioned his reinforcements skilfully as well and cooperated with George Morell, whose units formed the other part of the Union middle. The infantrymen performed well also. As Brian K. Burton notes, "[the infantrymen] stayed behind the guns most of the time and did not advance too far during countercharges. This behavior allowed the gunners a clear field of fire." Furthermore, if more of anything was needed, infantry or artillery, it was available. At the forefront of the Union victory, however, was the overwhelming firepower of their artillery, as later accounts by soldiers from both armies repeatedly attested.

A number of shortcomings in planning and execution contributed to the debacle suffered by the Confederates. The Confederate brigade leaders performed well, with the exception of a few minor instances; Burton surmises that the blame of July 1 must lie with the overall commanders. Longstreet was overconfident about the artillery strategy, which proved less effective than it could have been largely because of problems gathering the artillery for the assault. The Confederate practice of moving artillery with individual units instead of in one mass and the difficult terrain surrounding Malvern Hill contributed to this issue. A potential solution to this problem lay with Brig. Gen. <a href="William%20N.%20Pendleton">William N. Pendleton</a>'s fourteen batteries in reserve. However, Lee's headquarters never contacted Pendleton, who spent July 1 "await[ing] events and orders, in readiness for whatever service might be called for." These orders never came, and Pendleton's batteries went unused. Magruder might also share in the blame; his late arrival to the battlefield was caused by bad maps and faulty guides. Since Magruder received Chilton's draft late in the day, and with no time attached to it, there was no way for him to determine the relevance of the order. Burton suggests that Magruder cannot be reasonably blamed for his attacks on the Union line: he was responding to Lee's orders and did initially try to form a unified attack on the Union line. Finally, Magruder was riding back and forth across the battlefield, making it difficult for him to be found by junior officers seeking guidance. Several other factors may have played into the Confederate repulse, including Theophilus Holmes's refusal to participate in the battle, dismissing any notion of actively engaging the enemy.

Lee's part in the Confederate defeat at Malvern Hill has been criticized by historians. Though he put rested troops on the field and accepted Longstreet's suggestions, which did not commit him to a charge, Lee himself was not present on the battlefield to observe the fighting. Historian Stephen Sears points out that Lee's ineffective communication with his generals and apparent failure to write his own communications to his brigadier generals (instead leaving orders open to interpretation) may have contributed to the defeat. Lee could also have countermanded Chilton's orders when it became apparent they were fruitless, or verified the "success" of Armistead. Consequently, Lee must also share blame in the repeated lack of coordination of attacks throughout the day.

Despite the strength of Malvern Hill, as demonstrated in the battle, McClellan felt he needed to continue with his planned withdrawal to Harrison's Landing, to Fitz John Porter's chagrin. Porter felt that the Army of the Potomac should remain atop the hill or perhaps even continue their advance to Richmond. McClellan however insisted that Confederate troops greatly outnumbered his own, felt he could not protect Harrison's Landing from his current position at Malvern Hill, and feared being cut off from his supply depot. McClellan's mentality prevailed. The Union batteries and McClellan's engineers began moving to Harrison's Landing soon after the end of the Battle of Malvern Hill. Starting at about 11p.m. unit after unit began to follow. Within hours, nearly all of McClellan's Army of the Potomac was marching towards Harrison's Landing. Once the last of these men had crossed the Turkey Island Bridge, they destroyed the bridge and felled trees over it to stymie any pursuit, leaving the James River between the Union and Confederate armies.

The areas around Malvern Hill hosted much of Lee's army the night after the battle. Some of the Confederates were close enough to hear the sounds made by the Army of the Potomac retreating under cover of darkness, and see the lanterns of Northerners helping their wounded. The day after the Battle of Malvern Hill, Lee and Stonewall Jackson met President Jefferson Davis at Poindexter farm. They considered immediately pursuing McClellan; however, in view of the rain and confusion, Davis and Lee deemed large-scale pursuit of McClellan's army too risky. Jackson disagreed, saying, "They have not all got away if we go immediately after them." Jackson even had the bodies of the dead moved so that his soldiers had a clear line of attack when pursuing McClellan. However, Davis and Lee thought it necessary to rest the army. They did not completely rule out a pursuit though; Lee even ordered J. E. B. Stuart to reconnoiter McClellan's position for future attacks. Lee ordered Theophilus Holmes to move to Drewry's Bluff, and decided to keep the men on Malvern Hill through July 3 to forestall any potential Union attack against that location.

On July 4, 1862, Lee's men began marching towards Harrison's Landing. He made his headquarters a few miles north of Evelington Heights, a elevation approximately from Harrison's Landing, and stayed nearby with his army for several days, searching for weaknesses in the Union line at the heights that might allow for an attack. No weakness presented itself though, and by the end of July 8, the entire Army of Northern Virginia, save for cavalry stations and picket forces, was back near Richmond. The Peninsula Campaign was over.

Despite the defeat on Malvern Hill, the Seven Days Battles accomplished the original Confederate goal of removing any direct threat to Richmond from the Union Army. The three newspapers in Richmond exulted in this strategic victory and lionized Robert E. Lee as a national hero: "No captain that ever lived," opined the Richmond "Dispatch", "could have planned or executed a better plan." Similarly, <a href="Confederate%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Confederate Navy Secretary</a> <a href="Stephen%20Mallory">Stephen Mallory</a> said, "the Great McClelland [sic] the young Napoleon now like a whipped cur lies on the banks of the James River crouched under his Gun Boats." Throughout Richmond and the once-beleaguered South, there was a triumphant mood, and scant attention was paid to the flaws in Lee's tactics or execution.

Lee was not exultant, but "deeply, bitterly disappointed" at the result. "Our success has not been as great or complete as we should have desired", Lee wrote to his wife. In his official report, he wrote, "Under ordinary circumstances, the Federal Army should have been destroyed." The North Carolinian D. H. Hill shared Lee's bitterness, and wrote that the "blood of North Carolina poured like water". In a post-war article he wrote that the battle "was not war; it was murder." Lee did not distribute blame for the failure to reach his desired result, but there were repercussions. Several commanders were reassigned, including Theophilus Holmes and John Magruder, and his army was reorganized into two wings, one under Stonewall Jackson and another under James Longstreet. Further, Confederate artillery would now be moved in battalion-sized units, at the head of Confederate columns.
In McClellan's case, his success on Malvern Hill was overshadowed by his overall defeat in the Seven Days Battles. The Northern public met McClellan's defeat with despondency, and his reputation was tarnished. Some of McClellan's soldiers voiced their continued confidence in him. Such opinions were not unanimous, however; one of McClellan's engineers, Lt. <a href="William%20Folwell">William Folwell</a>, wondered why "they deify a General whose greatest feat has been a "masterly" retreat." A similar opinion was shared by many others in the rank and file of the Union military. Some in politics also abandoned the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> McClellan. He was also accused of being on the "Galena" during the Battle of Malvern Hill, and newspapers and tabloids around the country heaped scorn on him for this, especially when he ran for president in 1864. President Lincoln was also losing faith in McClellan. On June26, the day of Lee's first offensive during the Seven Days, the <a href="Army%20of%20Virginia">Army of Virginia</a> was formed and the command given to Maj. Gen. <a href="John%20Pope%20%28military%20officer%29">John Pope</a>. While McClellan was at Harrison's Landing, parts of his Army of the Potomac were continuously reassigned to Pope. Pope and his Army of Virginia left for <a href="Gordonsville%2C%20Virginia">Gordonsville, Virginia</a> on July 14, setting the stage for the subsequent <a href="Northern%20Virginia%20Campaign">Northern Virginia Campaign</a>.

In his "Battle-Pieces" publication, <a href="Herman%20Melville">Herman Melville</a> penned a poem about the battle, titled with the same name as the hill on which it was fought. In the poem, Melville questions the elms of Malvern Hill of whether they recall "the haggard beards of blood" the day of the battle.

The battlefield at Malvern Hill is credited by the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> as being "the best preserved Civil War battlefield in central or southern Virginia." Most recent preservation efforts there have been the consequence of cooperative efforts between <a href="Richmond%20National%20Battlefield%20Park">Richmond National Battlefield Park</a> and the <a href="Civil%20War%20Trust">Civil War Trust</a> (a division of the <a href="American%20Battlefield%20Trust">American Battlefield Trust</a>. The Trust has acquired and preserved of the battlefield in more than six transactions since 1994. Its efforts have been bolstered by the Virginia Land Conservation Fund, the <a href="Association%20for%20the%20Preservation%20of%20Virginia%20Antiquities">Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities</a>, and officials from Henrico County. Most of this tract wraps around the intersection of Willis Church Road and Carter's Mill Road. The land includes the starting point for the Confederate assaults on the day of the battle, the Willis Church Parsonage, the ruins of which remain visible today. Recent preservation efforts include the acquisition of the Crew house in 2013. As of 2005, the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> reported that of land was protected on and around Malvern Hill to preserve the battlefield. (More land has been acquired and preserved since then by the <a href="American%20Battlefield%20Trust">American Battlefield Trust</a> as per citation 114). Driving and walking tours, among other services, are offered at the site.

In August 2016, the 871-acre Malvern Hill Farm was listed for sale for $10.6 Million by the descendants of William H. Ferguson Sr. (1885-1984). It was purchased by the non-profit <a href="http%3A//www.capitalregionland.org">Capital Region Land Conservancy</a> (CRLC) in Feb 2018 for $6.6 Million.

2006 UAW-Ford 500

The 2006 UAW-Ford 500 was a stock car race that took place on October 8, 2006. The 38th annual running of the <a href="1000Bulbs.com%20500">UAW-Ford 500</a>, it was held at <a href="Talladega%20Superspeedway">Talladega Superspeedway</a> in <a href="Talladega%2C%20Alabama">Talladega, Alabama</a>, before 160,000 spectators; the 188-lap race was the thirtieth in the <a href="2006%20NASCAR%20Nextel%20Cup%20Series">2006 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series</a> and the fourth in the ten-race, season-ending <a href="Chase%20for%20the%20Sprint%20Cup">Chase for the Nextel Cup</a>. <a href="Brian%20Vickers">Brian Vickers</a> of <a href="Hendrick%20Motorsports">Hendrick Motorsports</a> won the race; <a href="Kasey%20Kahne">Kasey Kahne</a> finished second, and <a href="Kurt%20Busch">Kurt Busch</a> came in third.

<a href="David%20Gilliland">David Gilliland</a>, who had the <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a>, was passed immediately by teammate <a href="Dale%20Jarrett">Dale Jarrett</a>. The race lead changed 63 times, with <a href="Dale%20Earnhardt%20Jr.">Dale Earnhardt Jr.</a> leading for the most laps (37). Earnhardt was leading on the final lap when he and <a href="Jimmie%20Johnson">Jimmie Johnson</a> crashed after Vickers made contact with Johnson's right rear <a href="quarter%20panel">quarter panel</a>, causing the race to end under caution flag conditions. Vickers (Johnson's teammate) was determined the race winner by <a href="NASCAR">NASCAR</a> and was later criticized since the crash lowered Johnson in the points standings.

The victory was the first in Vickers' career. After the race, <a href="Jeff%20Burton">Jeff Burton</a> maintained his <a href="List%20of%20NASCAR%20Sprint%20Cup%20Series%20champions">Drivers' Championship</a> points lead, although that lead decreased significantly because he had a flat tire during the final laps of the race. <a href="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a> maintained its lead in the <a href="List%20of%20NASCAR%20Manufacturers%27%20champions">Manufacturers' Championship</a>, 51 points ahead of <a href="Dodge">Dodge</a> and 52 ahead of <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> with six races remaining in the season.

<a href="Talladega%20Superspeedway">Talladega Superspeedway</a> is one of six <a href="superspeedway">superspeedway</a>s which host <a href="NASCAR">NASCAR</a> races. The standard track is a four-turn, superspeedway. Its turns are <a href="Banked%20turn">banked</a> 33 degrees, and its <a href="Straight%20%28racing%29">front stretch</a> (the location of the finish line) is banked at 16.5 degrees. The back stretch also has a two-degree bank.
Before the race <a href="Jeff%20Burton">Jeff Burton</a> led the <a href="List%20of%20NASCAR%20Sprint%20Cup%20Series%20champions">Drivers' Championship</a> with 5,511 points, with <a href="Denny%20Hamlin">Denny Hamlin</a> second and <a href="Mark%20Martin">Mark Martin</a> third. <a href="Matt%20Kenseth">Matt Kenseth</a> and <a href="Kevin%20Harvick">Kevin Harvick</a> rounded out the top five and <a href="Jeff%20Gordon">Jeff Gordon</a>, <a href="Dale%20Earnhardt%20Jr.">Dale Earnhardt Jr.</a>, <a href="Jimmie%20Johnson">Jimmie Johnson</a>, <a href="Kyle%20Busch">Kyle Busch</a> and <a href="Kasey%20Kahne">Kasey Kahne</a> rounded out the top ten drivers competing in the <a href="2006%20Chase%20for%20the%20Nextel%20Cup">2006 Chase for the Nextel Cup</a>. In the <a href="NASCAR%20Manufacturers%27%20Championship">Manufacturers' Championship</a>, <a href="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a> led with 222 points; <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> was second with 175, and <a href="Dodge">Dodge</a> was a close third with 174 points. <a href="Dale%20Jarrett">Dale Jarrett</a> was the race's defending champion.

After the previous race at Talladega (the <a href="2006%20Aaron%27s%20499">2006 Aaron's 499</a>), the track's condition was beginning to deteriorate. Cracks in the third and fourth turns were beginning to cause handling problems with the cars, and a temporary storage unit was built outside the track to accommodate the asphalt needed for resurfacing the track. The entire track, including the skid pad and pit road, was resurfaced, with the work completed shortly before the 2006 UAW-Ford 500 began.

Two 60-minute practice sessions were held the Friday before Sunday's race. In the first session Jeff Gordon was the fastest, ahead of Jarrett in second and <a href="Robby%20Gordon">Robby Gordon</a> in third. <a href="David%20Gilliland">David Gilliland</a> placed fourth and <a href="Dave%20Blaney">Dave Blaney</a> followed in fifth, with <a href="Casey%20Mears">Casey Mears</a>, <a href="J.%20J.%20Yeley">J. J. Yeley</a>, <a href="David%20Stremme">David Stremme</a>, <a href="Brian%20Vickers">Brian Vickers</a> and <a href="Kurt%20Busch">Kurt Busch</a> rounding out the top ten. Later that day, Robby Gordon paced the second session, with <a href="Bobby%20Labonte">Bobby Labonte</a>, Hamlin and <a href="Tony%20Stewart">Tony Stewart</a> in second, third and fourth place. Blaney duplicated his first-session result in fifth, followed by Yeley, Harvick, <a href="Scott%20Riggs">Scott Riggs</a>, <a href="Ryan%20Newman%20%28racing%20driver%29">Ryan Newman</a> and <a href="Tony%20Raines">Tony Raines</a>.

Forty-nine cars were entered in the qualifier, although due to NASCAR's <a href="Go%20or%20Go%20Home">qualifying procedure</a> only forty-three could race. Gilliland clinched his first career <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a> with a time of 49.950 seconds and was joined on the <a href="Graining%20%28motorsport%29">grid's</a> front row by Jarrett, his <a href="Robert%20Yates%20Racing">Robert Yates Racing</a> teammate. Johnson, Jeff Gordon and <a href="Greg%20Biffle">Greg Biffle</a> rounded out the top five positions, with <a href="Travis%20Kvapil">Travis Kvapil</a>, <a href="Chad%20Chaffin">Chad Chaffin</a>, <a href="Todd%20Bodine">Todd Bodine</a>, <a href="Hermie%20Sadler">Hermie Sadler</a>, <a href="Kirk%20Shelmerdine">Kirk Shelmerdine</a> and <a href="Kevin%20Lepage">Kevin Lepage</a> failing to qualify.

Early practice speeds approached . NASCAR had mandated before the qualifier that the holes in the cars' <a href="restrictor%20plate">restrictor plate</a>s be reduced by , later conceding that the rule may have affected some teams more than others. According to Gilliland, "They threw a curveball at us this morning with the restrictor plate and (engine builder) <a href="Doug%20Yates">Doug Yates</a> wasn't worried at all. He put the super-tune on it and the thing ran great." Earnhardt called the reduction in speed unnecessary: "The track is safe ... I don't feel (the late change in plate size) is a very fair situation for everybody. Once you're up around the 190s, what's two miles an hour? I don't see what the big deal is. The speed average is up because the corner speed remains better with the new asphalt. As far as running in a straight line, we're no faster than we've always run here." Despite the mandated change, NASCAR did not schedule an additional practice session.

Live television coverage of the race, the thirtieth of thirty-six in the <a href="2006%20NASCAR%20Nextel%20Cup%20Series">2006 season</a>, began in the United States at 1:00 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern Daylight Time</a> on <a href="NBC">NBC</a>. Rev. Mike Jackson gave the <a href="invocation">invocation</a> at 2:20, followed by the 151st Army Band's rendition of the <a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">national anthem</a>. The command for the drivers to start their engines was given by Gary Casteel of the <a href="United%20Automobile%20Workers">UAW</a>, and no driver had to move to the rear of the grid at the start.

The race began at 2:41 p.m. Jarrett passed Gilliland almost immediately to lead the first lap, but lost the lead to Jeff Gordon a lap later. <a href="Jamie%20McMurray">Jamie McMurray</a> passed Gordon for the lead on lap 4; by this time, Gilliland had fallen back to 30th after losing the <a href="Drafting%20%28aerodynamics%29">draft</a>. Three laps later Gordon regained the lead from McMurray, with drafting assistance from Vickers. On lap 18 McMurray reclaimed the lead from Gordon, and they exchanged the lead again two laps later. On lap 24 McMurray reclaimed the lead, and <a href="Kenny%20Wallace">Kenny Wallace</a> made a <a href="pit%20stop">pit stop</a> with his car smoking.

On lap 28, Biffle took the lead from McMurray and Earnhardt moved into the top five. <a href="Racing%20flags%23Green%20flag">Green-flag</a> pit stops were made from laps 30 to 33, with Biffle maintaining his lead. On lap 35 he was passed by Stewart, who lost the lead to <a href="Carl%20Edwards">Carl Edwards</a> and Kyle Busch two laps later. On the 38th lap, Earnhardt took the lead. Busch passed him on lap 41, with Earnhardt (in the outside lane) dropping back to seventh. On lap 46 Kenseth passed Kyle Busch for the lead, with Kurt Busch and Earnhardt passing Kenseth five laps later.

Earnhardt reclaimed the lead on lap 52, losing it seven laps later to <a href="Elliott%20Sadler">Elliott Sadler</a>. Sadler refueled on the next lap, giving the lead back to Earnhardt. Kenseth took the lead on lap 61, as Earnhardt and others made green-flag pit stops. Kenseth stopped on lap 71 with Biffle and Edwards, with Biffle taking the lead as the pit-stop cycle ended. Lap 72 saw the first caution, as Blaney's left rear tire shredded and he made a pit stop. Biffle, Edwards and <a href="Sterling%20Marlin">Sterling Marlin</a> stayed out, while the others stopped.

Biffle led the field back up to speed at the restart, and was passed on lap 77 by Jeff Gordon. Three laps later, Sadler made a pit stop with a flat right rear tire. On lap 90 Kyle Busch took the lead, losing it to Gordon on the next lap. Earnhardt passed Gordon on lap 93, holding the lead for nine laps. Vickers took the lead on lap 102; Earnhardt's left front tire went flat the next lap, costing him a lap. Green-flag pit stops began on lap 107, with Vickers stopping on lap 108 and giving the lead to McMurray. After the pit stops, Vickers regained the lead.

On lap 121 Kyle Busch took the lead, losing it to Jeff Gordon two laps later. Within a lap Gordon lost the draft and fell back to 27th, allowing Kenseth to regain the lead. On lap 127 <a href="Clint%20Bowyer">Clint Bowyer</a> passed Kenseth, holding the lead for two laps until a second <a href="Racing%20flags%23Yellow%20flag">yellow flag</a> was displayed due to debris. Hamlin and <a href="Michael%20Waltrip">Michael Waltrip</a> staggered their pit stops, enabling each of them to lead a lap under the caution. Bowyer regained the lead after Waltrip stopped, and the race restarted on lap 134. Kenseth moved back into the lead on the next lap, with Bowyer falling back to tenth.

In a <a href="The%20Big%20One%20%28NASCAR%29">multi-car accident</a> on the first turn of lap 137 Edwards and Mears collided, involving Biffle, Jeff Gordon, Hamlin, Harvick, Marlin, McMurray, <a href="Kyle%20Petty">Kyle Petty</a> and <a href="Martin%20Truex%20Jr.">Martin Truex Jr.</a> Gordon drove straight to the garage and others made pit stops, giving the lead to Burton. The race restarted on lap 145, during which many drivers topped up with fuel. Kenseth regained the lead; Vickers passed him on lap 147, with Johnson taking the lead a lap later. That lap <a href="Reed%20Sorenson">Reed Sorenson</a>'s engine failed, ending his race.

Truex Jr. stayed out of pit road, and led the field to the restart on lap 152 before Johnson passed him a lap later. On lap 154 <a href="Paul%20Menard">Paul Menard</a> took the lead, with drafting assistance from Earnhardt, before Johnson regained the lead a lap later. Kahne took the lead on lap 158, losing it to Earnhardt on lap 165. A five-car accident on turn two of lap 173, involving Yeley, Menard, Stewart, Stremme and Hamlin, prompted the fifth caution; none of the leaders made pit stops during this caution.

The race restarted on lap 178, with Earnhardt leading Johnson and Vickers. That lap, Burton (in fifth) had a flat left rear tire and lost a lap. The field then formed a single line, with most remaining in that formation for the rest of the race. On the final lap, Johnson and Vickers left turn two with Johnson moving out of line to pass Earnhardt. When Vickers tried to move out with Johnson to provide drafting assistance, he clipped Johnson's right rear quarter panel. Johnson clipped Earnhardt, sending both drivers into the infield. The yellow flag went out and the field was frozen in place, with the order of finish determined by where the drivers were when the caution began. This gave Vickers the victory (the first of his career), although he was booed by the crowd.

Vickers appeared in <a href="Glossary%20of%20motorsport%20terms%23V">Victory Lane</a> to celebrate his first career win in front of the crowd, earning $228,850 for the victory. Earnhardt was quick to forgive him for the last-lap accident: "He didn't wreck anyone on purpose. He was trying to push the 48. I don't think he thought, 'Oh, here's my chance to knock them both out.' He just got excited trying to push the 48." Johnson was less sanguine: "We had a great chance to make up some points and got crashed by a teammate ... I was real patient until the white flag was up. I got a good run inside the 8 and got a lot of help from behind — too much help ... Knowing the situation we're all in, I would hope someone would be a little more patient." Johnson's crew chief, <a href="Chad%20Knaus">Chad Knaus</a>, was annoyed: "I just don't think [Vickers] has the talent to understand what he has underneath him."

Vickers, who would leave <a href="Hendrick%20Motorsports">Hendrick Motorsports</a> in 2007 for <a href="Red%20Bull%20Racing%20Team">Red Bull Racing Team</a>, said: "I would expect them to be a little upset. Jimmie is my friend, my teammate, and he is running for a championship. But he knows just as well as I do that if I wasn't bump-drafting, he never would have had a shot to pass Junior." Additionally, he denied that he drove more aggressively because he was leaving. Third-place finisher Kurt Busch argued Vickers was in a "Catch-22" situation: "He was trying to help his teammate. It just didn't turn out that way. Vickers was doing the best he could to help the 48. He just didn't anticipate the 8 car blocking as long as he did." Vickers would later receive additional security during the next race weekend.

The result kept Burton in the lead in the Drivers' Championship. After the race, Jeff Gordon (who was involved in the lap-137 accident) was less optimistic about his championship chances: "This pretty much does it for us as far as I'm concerned for the championship. You knew exactly that something like that was going to happen." In the Manufacturers' Championship Chevrolet increased its point total to 231; Dodge moved into second place with 180 and Ford was a close third with 179. The race took three hours, ten minutes and twenty-three seconds to complete; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.

Suicide of Leelah Alcorn

Leelah Alcorn (November 15, 1997 – December 28, 2014) was an American <a href="transgender">transgender</a> girl whose <a href="suicide">suicide</a> attracted international attention. Alcorn had posted a <a href="suicide%20note">suicide note</a> to her <a href="Tumblr">Tumblr</a> blog, writing about societal standards affecting transgender people and expressing the hope that her death would create a dialogue about discrimination, abuse and lack of support for transgender people.

<a href="Sex%20assignment">Assigned</a> male at birth, she was given the name Joshua Alcorn and raised in <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> by a family affiliated with the <a href="Churches%20of%20Christ">Churches of Christ</a> movement. At age 14, she <a href="coming%20out">came out</a> as transgender to her parents, Carla and Doug Alcorn, who refused to accept her female gender identity. When she was 16, they denied her request to undergo <a href="Sex%20reassignment%20therapy">transition treatment</a>, instead sending her to Christian-based <a href="conversion%20therapy">conversion therapy</a> with the intention of convincing her to reject her gender identity and accept her gender as assigned at birth. After she revealed her attraction toward males to her classmates, her parents removed her from school and revoked her access to <a href="social%20media">social media</a>. In her suicide note, Alcorn cited loneliness and alienation as key reasons for her decision to end her life and blamed her parents for causing these feelings. She killed herself by walking out in front of oncoming traffic on the <a href="Interstate%2071">Interstate 71</a> highway.

Alcorn arranged for her suicide note to be posted online several hours after her death, and it soon attracted international attention across mainstream and social media. <a href="LGBT%20rights">LGBT rights</a> activists called attention to the incident as evidence of the problems faced by transgender youth, while vigils were held in her memory in the United States and United Kingdom. Petitions were formed calling for the establishment of "Leelah's Law", a ban on conversion therapy in the U.S., which received a supportive response from U.S. President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>. Within a year, the city of <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a> criminalised conversion therapy. Alcorn's parents were criticized for <a href="misgendering">misgendering</a> Leelah in comments that they made to the media, while LGBT rights activist <a href="Dan%20Savage">Dan Savage</a> blamed them for their child's death, and social media users subjected them to <a href="online%20harassment">online harassment</a>. They defended their refusal to accept their child's identity and their use of conversion therapy by reference to their Christian values.

Assigned male at birth, Alcorn was given the name Joshua Ryan Alcorn. She eventually rejected this forename, and in her suicide note signed herself "(Leelah) Josh Alcorn". She was one of several children. She described herself as being raised in a conservative Christian environment; she and her family attended the <a href="Churches%20of%20Christ">Northeast Church of Christ</a> in <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, and she had been featured in a profile of that church published in a 2011 article in "<a href="The%20Christian%20Chronicle">The Christian Chronicle</a>". As of 2014, the family lived in <a href="Kings%20Mills%2C%20Ohio">Kings Mills, Ohio</a>.

According to her suicide note, Alcorn had felt "like a girl trapped in a boy's body" since she was four, and came to identify as a transgender girl from the age of fourteen, when she became aware of the term. According to her note, she immediately informed her mother, who reacted "extremely negatively" by claiming that it was only a phase and that God had made her a male, so she could never be a woman. She stated that this made her hate herself, and that she developed a form of depression. Her mother sent her to Christian conversion therapists, but Alcorn later related that there she only encountered "more Christians" telling her that she was "selfish and wrong" and "should look to God for help". Aged sixteen, she requested that she be allowed to undergo transition treatment, but was denied permission: in her words, "I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep."

Alcorn publicly revealed her attraction to males when she was sixteen, as she believed that identifying as a gay male at that point would be a stepping stone to coming out as a transgender female at a later date. According to a childhood friend, Alcorn received a positive reception from many at Kings High School, although her parents were appalled. In Alcorn's words, "They felt like I was attacking their image, and that I was an embarrassment to them. They wanted me to be their perfect little <a href="Heterosexuality">straight</a> Christian boy, and that's obviously not what I wanted." They removed her from the school, and enrolled her as an eleventh grader at an online school, <a href="Ohio%20Virtual%20Academy">Ohio Virtual Academy</a>. According to Alcorn, her parents cut her off from the outside world for five months as they denied her access to social media and many forms of communication. She described this as a significant contributing factor towards her suicide. At the end of the school year, they returned her mobile phone to her and allowed her to regain contact with her friends, although by this time, according to Alcorn, her relationship with many of them had become strained, and she continued to feel isolated.

Two months before her death, Alcorn sought out help on the social media website <a href="Reddit">Reddit</a>, asking users whether the treatment perpetrated by her parents constituted <a href="child%20abuse">child abuse</a>. There, she revealed that while her parents had never physically assaulted her, "they always talked to me in a very derogatory tone" and "would say things like 'You'll never be a real girl' or 'What're you going to do, fuck boys?' or 'God's going to send you straight to hell'. These all made me feel awful about myself, I was Christian at the time so I thought that God hated me and that I didn't deserve to be alive." Further, she explained, "I tried my absolute hardest to live up to their standards and be a straight male, but eventually I realized that I hated religion and my parents." On Reddit, Alcorn also disclosed that she was prescribed increasing dosages of the anti-depressant <a href="Fluoxetine">Prozac</a>. In concluding her post, she wrote, "Please help me, I don't know what I should do and I can't take much more of this."

Alcorn's computer was recovered near the site of her suicide. It contained conversations showing that she had planned to jump off the bridge that crosses <a href="Interstate%2071">Interstate 71</a> days before the incident, but then contacted a <a href="crisis%20hotline">crisis hotline</a> and, as told to a friend, "basically cried my eyes out for a couple of hours talking to a lady there".

Prior to her death on December 28, 2014, Alcorn scheduled for her suicide note to be automatically posted on her Tumblr account at 5:30 pm. In the note, she stated her intention to end her life, commenting:

She expressed her wish that all of her possessions and money be donated to a transgender advocacy charity, and called for issues surrounding gender identity to be taught in schools.
The note ended with the statement: "My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say 'that's fucked up' and fix it. Fix society. Please." A second post appeared shortly after; titled "Sorry", it featured an apology to her close friends and siblings for the trauma that her suicide would put them through, but also contained a message to her parents: "Fuck you. You can't just control other people like that. That's messed up." An additional, handwritten suicide note reading "I've had enough" was found on her bed, but then thrown away by Alcorn's mother after police made a copy.

In the early morning of December 28, police informed news sources that she had been walking southbound on Interstate 71 near <a href="Union%20Township%2C%20Warren%20County%2C%20Ohio">Union Township</a> when she was struck by a semi-trailer just before 2:30 am near the South Lebanon exit. She died at the scene. It is believed that Alcorn walked three to four miles from her parents' Kings Mill house, before being struck. The highway was closed for more than an hour after the incident. An investigation was launched by the <a href="Ohio%20State%20Highway%20Patrol">Ohio State Highway Patrol</a>, while Alcorn's body was transported to the <a href="Montgomery%20County%2C%20Ohio">Montgomery County</a> coroner, where an <a href="autopsy">autopsy</a> was scheduled. The truck driver was uninjured in the incident.

Within 48 hours of the posting of her suicide note, it had attracted 82,272 views, and by the morning of December 31, it had been reposted on Tumblr 200,000 times. Writing for the "<a href="Boston%20Globe">Boston Globe</a>", the reporter Maura Johnston described it as a "passionate post". The suicide note was later deleted after Alcorn's parents asked for it to be removed, and the blog was made inaccessible to the public. According to the family minister, the Alcorn family decided to hold the funeral privately after receiving threats. Alcorn's body was reportedly <a href="Cremation">cremated</a>. The Ohio State Patrol completed their investigation into Alcorn's death on April 30, 2015, officially ruling it a suicide.

On December 28 at 2:56 p.m., Alcorn's mother, Carla Wood Alcorn, posted a public message on the social media website <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a>, stating: "My sweet 16-year-old son, Joshua Ryan Alcorn, went home to Heaven this morning. He was out for an early morning walk and was hit by a truck. Thank you for the messages and kindness and concern you have sent our way. Please continue to keep us in your prayers." Carla Alcorn's post was subsequently deleted, and her Facebook account was made private. The Alcorn family publicly requested that they be given privacy to grieve in a statement issued by the <a href="Kings%20Local%20School%20District">Kings Local School District</a>. In that statement, staff from Alcorn's former school, Kings High School, declared that "Joshua Alcorn was a sweet, talented, tender-hearted 17-year-old", adding that counselors would be made available to students affected by the incident. A moment of silence was held in Alcorn's memory before a Kings High basketball game on December 30.

Some of Alcorn's sympathizers publicly criticized the teen's mother, Carla Alcorn, for <a href="misgendering">misgendering</a> her daughter in the Facebook post announcing the teenager's death. Some individuals—termed "the Internet's self-appointed vigilantes" in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>"—subsequently <a href="Doxing">doxed</a> and harassed Carla via her Facebook account "in revenge" for Leelah's death. Writing for the United Kingdom-based website "<a href="Spiked%20%28magazine%29">Spiked</a>", the columnist <a href="Brendan%20O%27Neill%20%28journalist%29">Brendan O'Neill</a> stated that those harassing Alcorn's parents represented "a new breed of illiberal liberal" who were intolerant of anyone holding conservative views on social issues. He compared their tactics with those of the <a href="Westboro%20Baptist%20Church">Westboro Baptist Church</a>, for both "view harassment of the bereaved as a legitimate form of politics".

On Twitter, American gay rights activist <a href="Dan%20Savage">Dan Savage</a> argued that Alcorn's parents should be prosecuted for their role in bringing about their daughter's death, commenting that through their actions they "threw her in front of that truck". He cited the successful prosecution of <a href="New%20Jersey%20v.%20Dharun%20Ravi">Dharun Ravi</a> following the <a href="suicide%20of%20Tyler%20Clementi">suicide of Tyler Clementi</a> as a legal precedent for such an action. He added that legal action should also be brought against the conversion therapists who had counselled Leelah, and suggested that the Alcorns should lose custody of their other children.

Carla Alcorn responded to such criticism in an interview with <a href="CNN">CNN</a>, stating "we loved him unconditionally. We loved him no matter what. I loved my son. People need to know that I loved him. He was a good kid, a good boy." Although acknowledging that Leelah had requested transition surgery, Carla stated that she had never heard her child use the name "Leelah", before reiterating her refusal to accept her child's transgender status, adding "We don't support that, religiously." She expressed concern that users of social media thought her to be a "horrible person", but defended her actions in dealing with her child, stating for example that she had banned internet access to prevent access to "inappropriate" things. In an email to Cincinnati-based channel <a href="WCPO-TV">WCPO-TV</a>, Leelah's father Doug Alcorn wrote, "We love our son, Joshua, very much and are devastated by his death. We have no desire to enter into a political storm or debate with people who did not know him. We wish to grieve in private. We harbor no ill will towards anyone. ... I simply do not wish our words to be used against us."

Writing for <a href="Salon%20%28website%29">"Salon"</a>, <a href="Mary%20Elizabeth%20Williams">Mary Elizabeth Williams</a> commented that "it would be cruel and inaccurate to suggest that Carla Alcorn did not love her child", but added that Carla's statement that she "loved him unconditionally" revealed "a tragic lack of understanding of the word 'unconditionally', even in death". "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" magazine quoted Johanna Olson, Medical Director for the Center of Trans Youth Health and Development at <a href="Children%27s%20Hospital%20Los%20Angeles">Children's Hospital Los Angeles</a>, as stating that "Did Leelah's parents love her? Yes, I'm sure they did. Did they support her? No, they didn't. And that's a tragedy." Mara Keisling, the Executive Director of the <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Transgender%20Equality">National Center for Transgender Equality</a>, was quoted as stating that the blaming of Alcorn's parents was unhelpful, adding, "Despite the great cultural and policy advances transgender people have made, there is still a lot of disrespect, discrimination and violence aimed at us. And being a child or a teenager of any kind today is very difficult."

The day after Alcorn's suicide note was published online, <a href="Chris%20Seelbach%20%28politician%29">Chris Seelbach</a>, the first openly gay councilman on <a href="Cincinnati%20City%20Council">Cincinnati City Council</a>, shared it as part of a Facebook message in which he stated that her death showed how hard it was to be transgender in the U.S. His post was shared over 4,700 times and increased public awareness of the incident. By December 30, Alcorn's death had attracted worldwide attention. News outlets across the world had picked up the story, and the <a href="hashtag">hashtag</a> #LeelahAlcorn had topped <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>. According to British newspaper "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", the incident "triggered widespread anguish and raised a debate about the rights of transgender people". The U.S.-based "<a href="Boston%20Globe">Boston Globe</a>" stated that it "served as a flashpoint for transgender progress in 2014", while "<a href="The%20New%20Republic">The New Republic</a>" referred to it as having "sparked a national conversation about the plight of transgender kids and the scanty rights and respect our society affords them."

On January 1, 2015, the Cincinnati-based LGBT rights group Support Marriage Equality Ohio hosted a vigil for Alcorn outside Kings High School. A candlelight vigil in <a href="Goodale%20Park">Goodale Park</a>, Columbus, was held on January 2 by a group called Stand Up 4 Leelah. A further vigil was organized by both The Diverse City Youth Chorus in partnership with the Cincinnati chapter of the <a href="Gay%2C%20Lesbian%20and%20Straight%20Education%20Network">Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network</a> at the Clifton Cultural Arts Center for January 10. The vigil location at the Clifton Cultural Arts Center was moved to the Woodward Theater, to make way for a larger setting. The event was attended by over 500 people.

A January 3 vigil was scheduled for <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a> in <a href="London">London</a>; an organizer was quoted as saying that "[Alcorn's] death was a political death. When a member of our community is brutalised at the hands of oppression we must all fight back". Those who spoke at the event included politician <a href="Sarah%20Brown%20%28politician%29">Sarah Brown</a> and novelist and poet <a href="Roz%20Kaveney">Roz Kaveney</a>. Marches were carried out in honor of Alcorn in both <a href="Northwest%2C%20Washington%2C%20D.C.">Northwest, Washington, D.C.</a>, and <a href="Queen%20Street%2C%20Auckland">Queen Street, Auckland</a>, on January 10. The same day, a candlelight vigil was held in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>'s <a href="Columbus%20Circle">Columbus Circle</a>. A memorial protest against conversion therapy and in memory of Alcorn took place in <a href="Lynchburg%2C%20Virginia">Lynchburg, Virginia</a>, on January 24, 2015.

Among the transgender celebrities who publicly responded to the incident were <a href="Janet%20Mock">Janet Mock</a>, <a href="Andreja%20Peji%C4%87">Andreja Pejić</a>, and <a href="Laverne%20Cox">Laverne Cox</a>, while the musician <a href="Ray%20Toro">Ray Toro</a> released a song, "For the Lost and Brave", in dedication to Alcorn. <a href="Jill%20Soloway">Jill Soloway</a>, the writer of the television show "<a href="Transparent%20%28TV%20series%29">Transparent</a>", dedicated her <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a> for Best Television Series to Alcorn. During <a href="Diane%20Sawyer">Diane Sawyer</a>'s interview with <a href="Caitlyn%20Jenner">Caitlyn Jenner</a> (then Bruce), which confirmed Jenner's transgender identity, Alcorn was mentioned by name and the message "Fix society. Please" was broadcast. In June 2015, the singer <a href="Miley%20Cyrus">Miley Cyrus</a> founded the <a href="Happy%20Hippie%20Foundation">Happy Hippie Foundation</a>, an organisation to raise awareness of homelessness and LGBT issues among young people, partly in response to Alcorn's death. To promote the organisation, she released a new series of "<a href="Backyard%20Sessions">Backyard Sessions</a>" videos, the second of which, <a href="Dido%20%28singer%29">Dido</a>'s "<a href="No%20Freedom">No Freedom</a>" was dedicated to Alcorn.

Carolyn Washburn, editor of the Ohio newspaper "<a href="The%20Cincinnati%20Enquirer">The Cincinnati Enquirer</a>", stated that the incident "raises important issues we hope will prompt conversations in families throughout our region". Washburn had also received letters that derided the newspaper's use of Alcorn's chosen name in covering her death. When contacted by "The Cincinnati Enquirer", Shane Morgan, the founder and chair of transgender advocate group TransOhio, stated that while 2014 witnessed gains for the trans rights movement, Alcorn's death illustrated how "trans people are still being victimized and still being disrespected", highlighting the high rate of transgender people who had been murdered that year. Since the incident, TransOhio received letters from parents of transgender children describing how Alcorn's death had affected them. Morgan stated that while he understood the anger directed toward Alcorn's parents, "there's no excuse for threats to the family."

Allison Woolbert, executive director of the Transgender Human Rights Institute, informed "The Independent" that Alcorn's case was "not unique"; the newspaper highlighted research from the <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> indicating that LGBT youth are about twice as likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual, <a href="cisgender">cisgender</a> teenagers. "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" similarly placed Alcorn's suicide within its wider context of <a href="transphobia">transphobic</a> discrimination, highlighting that the <a href="Youth%20Suicide%20Prevention%20Program">Youth Suicide Prevention Program</a> reports that over 50 percent of transgender youths attempt suicide before the age of 20, and that the <a href="National%20Coalition%20of%20Anti-Violence%20Programs">National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs</a> recently published a report indicating that 72 percent of LGBT homicide victims in 2013 were transgender women.
<a href="Kevin%20Jennings">Kevin Jennings</a> of the <a href="Arcus%20Foundation">Arcus Foundation</a> also situated Alcorn's death within wider problems facing young LGBT people. In his view, she became "an international symbol of the ongoing challenges faced by LGBT youth", adding that her death "reminds us of a basic lesson still being taught to young people across America: When it comes to gender identity, it's best to be cisgender; and when it comes to sexual orientation, it's best to be straight."

Under the Twitter hashtag #RealLiveTransAdult, many transgender people posted encouraging tweets for their younger counterparts, while other hashtags, such as #ProtectTransKids, and the term "Rest in Power", also circulated on Twitter. A <a href="change.org">change.org</a> petition was set up calling for Leelah's chosen name to be included on her <a href="gravestone">gravestone</a>, which gained over 80,000 signatures. On January 6, Adam Hoover of Marriage Equality Ohio remarked that, since the request of having Alcorn's chosen name on her gravestone seemed "like a slim possibility", they would be raising money for a permanent memorial arranged as a bench, tree and <a href="commemorative%20plaque">commemorative plaque</a>.

Under Ohio's <a href="Adopt-a-Highway">Adopt-a-Highway</a> program, a group adopted the interchange of Interstate 71 South and <a href="Ohio%20State%20Route%2048">Ohio State Route 48</a>—which was where Alcorn died—and dedicated it to her memory. As a result, the <a href="Ohio%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Ohio Department of Transportation</a> erected signs stating "In Memory of Leelah Alcorn" along the road. Members of the group affixed a wreath to one of these signs; group member Lisa Oravec informed press that "We don't want Leelah to be forgotten... We want people in Cincinnati, or anybody driving down 71 to see the wreath. See the highway. If they don't know who Leelah is they'll google it, educate it, and learn from what happened." As of December 2018, the "Leelah Alcorn Highway Memorial" group continued to meet four times a year to clean that stretch of road. The highway memorial formed the basis of a short documentary, "Leelah's Highway", which was screened at the 2018 Cindependent Film Festival in Cincinnati's Woodward Theater. Its creator, Elizabeth Littlejohn of <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, stated that "as a human rights activist who believes [in] the right for gender self-determination, I believe this story needed to be told."

A Facebook group called "Justice for Leelah Alcorn" was established, while a petition calling for "Leelah's Law", a ban on conversion therapy in the United States, was created by the Transgender Human Rights Institute to raise awareness of the psychologically harmful effects of such practices; by January 24 it had 330,009 signatures, and was named the fastest growing change.org petition of 2014. A second appeal demanding the enactment of "Leelah's Law" was posted to the <a href="We%20the%20People%20%28petitioning%20system%29">We the People</a> section of <a href="WhiteHouse.gov">WhiteHouse.gov</a> on January 3, 2015, which garnered more than 100,000 signatures as of January 30. In response to the petition, in April 2015 President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> called for the banning of conversion therapy for minors.

In December 2015, Cincinnati became the second U.S. city after <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, to ban the practice of conversion therapy outright; council member Chris Seelbach cited Alcorn's suicide as an influence in the decision and stated that "she challenged us to make her death matter, and we're doing just that". By October 2018, four cities across Ohio had banned conversion therapy, leading journalist Nico Lang to comment that "the Buckeye State has become an unlikely leader in banning conversion therapy at the local level."

Monroe Edwards

Monroe Edwards (1808 – January 27, 1847) was an American slave trader, forger, and criminal who was the subject of a well-publicized trial and conviction in 1842. Originally from <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, Edwards moved to <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> then settled in <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. He smuggled slaves into <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> in 1832 and used the proceeds to purchase land in Texas. In 1836, he was again smuggling slaves, this time into Texas. After attempting to swindle his partner out of the profits of the venture, partly with forged documents, Edwards was forced to flee the <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a> to the United States. He then tried to scam money out of various <a href="abolitionist">abolitionist</a>s in the United States and the United Kingdom, partly with forged letters of introduction. He traveled to the United Kingdom, but his schemes were mainly unsuccessful and he returned to the United States in mid-1841.

Edwards' largest swindle involved forged letters from cotton brokers in New Orleans which he used to secure bank drafts for large sums that he then cashed. His fabrications caught up with him, and he was arrested and tried for the forgeries in June 1842. Convicted partly because his distinctive good looks made him memorable and easily recognizable, and partly from making the same spelling errors in his fakes, Edwards was sentenced to 10 years in prison and died in 1847 while incarcerated. Several sensational accounts of his offenses and trial were published after his death, and he was mentioned in <a href="Herman%20Melville">Herman Melville</a>'s 1853 short story "<a href="Bartleby%2C%20the%20Scrivener">Bartleby, the Scrivener</a>".

Edwards was born in 1808 in <a href="Danville%2C%20Kentucky">Danville, Kentucky</a>. His father was reported to be Amos or Moses Edwards, but his mother's name is unknown. He had a brother Amos and an uncle, Haden, who lived in <a href="Nacogdoches%2C%20Texas">Nacogdoches</a>. Nothing is known with certainty of his childhood. As a grown man, he was considered very handsome, and usually dressed fashionably. Some accounts give him the title "<a href="Colonel%20%28title%29">Colonel</a>".

Around 1822, Edwards was sent to <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> to learn business from a merchant named Mr. Morgan. By the late 1820s, Morgan had established a trading post on <a href="San%20Jacinto%20Bay">San Jacinto Bay</a> near <a href="Galveston">Galveston</a> in what was then <a href="Mexican%20Texas">Mexican Texas</a>. Sometime after, Edwards met a slave trader and joined his new acquaintance on a smuggling trip to acquire slaves in Africa. This first effort ended when they were shipwrecked, but on a second attempt in 1832 they succeeded in smuggling slaves into Brazil. Edwards invested this venture's profits into land in Texas, where in late 1833 he established a plantation on the <a href="San%20Bernard%20River">San Bernard River</a> in present-day <a href="Brazoria%20County%2C%20Texas">Brazoria County, Texas</a>; he named his new home "<a href="Chenango%2C%20Texas">Chenango</a>". Unconnected with his slave trading, Edwards was arrested in 1832 as part of the <a href="Anahuac%20Disturbances">Anahuac Disturbances</a>, and was briefly imprisoned during the uprising against the Mexican government which ruled Texas.

Edwards' next efforts in smuggling involved a new partner, <a href="Christopher%20Dart">Christopher Dart</a>, a lawyer from <a href="Natchez%2C%20Mississippi">Natchez</a>, Mississippi. In 1835 Dart invested $40,000 to buy the contracts of <a href="indentured%20servant">indentured blacks</a> in Cuba and smuggle them into Texas as slaves. Instead of providing money for the partnership, Edwards' contribution was <a href="land%20certificate">land certificate</a>s. At the time, Texas was a <a href="Mexican%20Texas">Mexican border province</a>. In 1829, Mexico had abolished slavery as well as the importation of slaves, but gave Texas an exemption from emancipating slaves who were already in the territory. To circumvent the ban on importing slaves, traders instead reclassified them as indentured servants with 99-year contracts. The Mexican government cracked down on this practice in 1832, limiting terms of <a href="indenture">indenture</a> to a maximum of 10 years. Edwards secured further financing from a New Orleans company named George Knight and Company and then went to <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> where he purchased slaves.

In February 1836 Edwards landed 170 black people in Texas, taking advantage of the confusion surrounding the end of the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a> and the establishment of the independent <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a>, which had not yet outlawed the importation of slaves. William Fisher, the customs collector on the <a href="Brazos%20River">Brazos River</a>, wrote to the <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Texas%23Constitutional%20Convention%20and%20Ratification">Texas Constitutional Convention</a> that Edwards did not report the importation to the authorities, and Fisher went to Edwards' plantation to confront Edwards. Because of uncertainty about the legality of importing slaves, Fisher did not seize the slaves but referred the issue to the newly formed Texas Government after securing a <a href="Surety%20bond">monetary bond</a> from Edwards. Although the new Texas Republic eventually outlawed the importation of slaves from anywhere but the United States, Edwards' landing of slaves from Cuba in early 1836 was never prosecuted. After this, Edwards also established a slave market on <a href="Galveston%20Bay">Galveston Bay</a>, near present-day <a href="San%20Leon%2C%20Texas">San Leon</a>. In 1837, he was sued by Robert Peebles for fraud involving the sale of a slave with <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> to Peebles. Peebles won the case.

Edwards then tried to change the deal with Dart. Instead of dividing the smuggled slaves between the two men, Edwards tried to keep all the slaves and instead repay the money Dart had advanced him, with some interest. Dart sued, and at the trial in March 1839 Edwards offered two forged documents claiming that Dart had sold his interest in the slaves to Edwards. In forging the documents, Edwards originally secured Dart's signature on a document written in a type of ink that could later be chemically removed. After Dart signed the document, Edwards then removed the original wording of the document and substituted a deed selling Dart's interest in the land and slaves. The documents were determined to be forgeries and on April 2, 1840, Dart was awarded $89,000. Edwards fled the Republic of Texas to the United States.

As part of a plot to discredit both Dart and the government of Texas, Edwards persuaded some abolitionists in <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a> to give him money with which he would supposedly liberate the slaves on his plantation in Texas, which he no longer owned. Edwards also tried to get money from the <a href="American%20and%20Foreign%20Anti-Slavery%20Society">American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society</a> in New York, but its leader, <a href="Lewis%20Tappan">Lewis Tappan</a>, did not trust him and Edwards did not receive any money. Edwards then went to England, bearing forged letters of introduction from, among others, <a href="Daniel%20Webster">Daniel Webster</a> and the American <a href="Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a>, <a href="John%20Forsyth%20%28Georgia%29">John Forsyth</a>. One of these letters was to <a href="John%20Spencer%2C%20Viscount%20Althorp">Lord Spencer</a>, who was so impressed he gave Edwards <a href="pound%20%28currency%29">£</a>250 as a loan. While in England, Edwards defrauded a company in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> of about $20,000, and then used part of the funds to repay Lord Spencer. The Republic of Texas ambassador in London warned the English government against Edwards. Tappan also sent warnings, so Edwards was unable to acquire more money in England and had returned to the United States by June 1841.

Edwards' next fraudulent scheme involved forging letters to cotton brokers in New Orleans and using the signatures obtained from their replies to forge letters to brokers in New York City, saying that the fake John Caldwell – Edwards' alias – had a large amount of cotton on deposit with the New Orleans brokers. Edwards used those letters to secure fraudulent loans from brokers on the security of the non-existent cotton. Two New York brokers – <a href="Brown%20Bros.%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Brown Bros. & Co.</a> and <a href="Jacob%20Little">Jacob Little</a> – gave Edwards <a href="bank%20draft">bank draft</a>s for $25,000 each. Edwards then cashed the drafts pretending to be Caldwell, but without attempting to disguise his appearance. Unluckily for Edwards, in September 1841 Brown Brothers was informed by the New Orleans brokers that there was no cotton on account for Caldwell, and this prompted the bankers to offer a reward for information on the forger. The police began to search for the forger of the letters but were unsuccessful until Edwards attempted to distract their attention to an acquaintance, Alexander Powell, who happened to look much like him. Edwards sent an anonymous letter to the New York police, stating that the forger they were hunting was sailing to England, as Powell was about to do. Edwards assumed that by the time the police acted, Powell's ship would already have sailed. The ship was delayed and the police were able to catch Powell, who told them that Edwards was their forger.

After his arrest, Edwards was imprisoned in <a href="the%20Tombs">the Tombs</a>, New York City's jail. When he was arrested, he had more than $44,000 in a trunk in his room. While in jail awaiting trial, Edwards forged a letter alleging he had funds in New Orleans, and then showed the letter to one of his lawyers in order to reassure the lawyer about Edwards' ability to pay for legal counsel. In an attempt to delay his trial, Edwards also forged a letter from a supposed witness, Charles Johnson, stating that he was in Cuba and would not be able to come and testify for Edwards for a while; this gained Edwards a three-month delay.

Edwards' trial was in June 1842 and was a media sensation. He secured a defense team of six lawyers, including <a href="John%20J.%20Crittenden">John J. Crittenden</a>, a sitting <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senator</a>, and <a href="Thomas%20F.%20Marshall">Thomas F. Marshall</a>, a sitting <a href="U.S.%20Representative">U.S. Representative</a>. Both Crittenden and Marshall absented themselves from their legislative duties during the trial. One of the junior lawyers was <a href="William%20M.%20Evarts">William M. Evarts</a>, who presented the opening remarks for the defense. Another defense lawyer was <a href="John%20Worth%20Edmonds">John Worth Edmonds</a>, whom Edwards paid with a forged check. Edwards' handsome appearance worked against him, when one of the bankers who had cashed the drafts identified him in court and remarked that he remembered Edwards because of his striking good looks. Edwards had also neglected to dispose of a marked <a href="bank%20bag">bank bag</a> from one of the banks that cashed the fraudulently obtained draft. A final tie-in was the commonality of misspellings between letters from Edwards and the forged letters. The trial ended with Edwards being convicted and given a 10-year prison sentence. The trial's proceedings were published by a New York newspaper, "<a href="New%20York%20Herald">The Herald</a>", and ran to 50,000 copies. None of Edwards' lawyers were ever paid for their services. He was sent to <a href="Sing%20Sing">Sing Sing</a> prison, where he attempted to use forged letters to escape. Edwards died in prison on January 27, 1847, of <a href="tuberculosis">consumption</a>. He was insane at the time of his death.

Edwards earned a mention in <a href="Herman%20Melville">Herman Melville</a>'s story "<a href="Bartleby%2C%20the%20Scrivener">Bartleby, the Scrivener</a>". Melville used the names of contemporaneous events and people to give a contemporary feel to his short stories. One of his characters is imprisoned in the Tombs with the main character, and he asks if he is a "gentleman forger" like Edwards. The career of Melville's narrator in "Bartleby" parallels that of Edmonds, who defended Edwards then went on to be the prison inspector at Sing Sing during Edwards' prison term and was known for his attempts to improve the treatment of the prisoners. Melville's narrator also tries to secure better treatment for Bartleby. The narrator's description of Bartleby just prior to death "eerily echoed" the state of Edwards just prior to his death, in the words of Robert Wilson.

Edwards was known as the "Great Forger" during and after his trial. The main account of his life and trial is "Life and Adventures of the Accomplished Forger and Swindler, Colonel Monroe Edwards", which was written by an editor of the "<a href="National%20Police%20Gazette">National Police Gazette</a>" in 1848, probably by <a href="George%20Wilkes">George Wilkes</a>. It is the fullest account of Edwards' life but mingles fact with fiction to the extent that it has been listed in bibliographies of American fiction. Wilkes' account is the source for the story of Kitty Clover, supposedly a slave who loved Edwards, rescued him, and followed him throughout his life. There are other accounts, including two anonymous narratives published in 1842.

Girl Pat

Girl Pat was a small <a href="fishing%20trawler">fishing trawler</a>, based at the <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a> port of <a href="Grimsby">Grimsby</a>, that in 1936 was the subject of a media sensation when its captain took it on an unauthorised transatlantic voyage. The escapade ended in <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Guyana">Georgetown</a>, <a href="British%20Guiana">British Guiana</a>, with the arrest of the captain, <a href="Dod%20Orsborne">George "Dod" Orsborne</a>, and his brother. The pair were later imprisoned for the theft of the vessel.

Built in 1935, "Girl Pat" was the property of the Marstrand Fishing Company of Grimsby. On 1 April 1936, Orsborne, with a crew of four and his brother James as a <a href="wikt%3Asupernumerary">supernumerary</a>, took the vessel out on what the owners authorised as a routine <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> fishing trip of two to three weeks' duration. After leaving port, Orsborne informed the crew that they were going on an extended cruise in more southerly waters. Nothing more was heard of them until mid-May, when the owners, who had by then assumed the vessel lost, received invoices relating to its repair and reprovisioning in the northern Spanish port of <a href="Corcubi%C3%B3n">Corcubión</a>. Subsequent sightings placed her in the <a href="Savage%20Islands">Savage Islands</a>, at <a href="Dakar">Dakar</a> in Senegal, and <a href="%C3%8Eles%20du%20Salut">Îles du Salut</a> off the coast of <a href="French%20Guiana">French Guiana</a> in South America. The captain's main means of navigation during a voyage of more than was a sixpenny school atlas and a compass. At one point "Girl Pat" was reported wrecked in the Bahamas, with all hands lost. After the vessel's capture and detention following a chase outside Georgetown on 19 June, Orsborne and his crew were hailed as heroes in the world's press.

Charged with the theft of the vessel in October 1936, Orsborne maintained in court that the owners had instructed him to get rid of the ship, as part of a scheme to obtain its insurance value. This claim was dismissed by the court. Years later, in his memoirs, Orsborne told a different, uncorroborated story: in absconding with "Girl Pat" he had been carrying out a mission on behalf of <a href="Naval%20Intelligence%20Division">British Naval Intelligence</a>, connected with the outbreak of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War%2C%201936">Spanish Civil War</a> in July 1936.

After his release from prison, Orsborne took part in further maritime adventures and served in the navy in the Second World War. He died in 1957. In Georgetown "Girl Pat" was acquired by new owners who returned her to Britain, where she was displayed as a tourist attraction in several resorts. In 1939 she was sold to the <a href="Port%20of%20London%20Authority">Port of London Authority</a> for use as a wreck-marking vessel and, after being requisitioned by the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> during the war, was returned to the authority in 1945. There is no public record of her subsequent career.

<a href="George%20%26quot%3BDod%26quot%3B%20Orsborne">George Black Orsborne</a> was born George Black on 4 July 1902, in the small north Scottish coastal town of <a href="Buckie">Buckie</a>. He assumed the Orsborne name when his widowed mother remarried and moved the family to <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, where George, nicknamed "Dod", spent his formative years. When he was 14, Orsborne lied about his age and enlisted as a Boy Seaman in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>; in his memoirs he wrote: "I never did have an adolescence". He served in the <a href="Dover%20Patrol">Dover Patrol</a>, and was wounded during the 1918 <a href="Zeebrugge%20Raid">Zeebrugge Raid</a>. After leaving the Navy in December 1919 and working ashore for a brief period, he was persuaded by a former captain of the "<a href="Cutty%20Sark">Cutty Sark</a>," Captain Wilkins, to go back to sea. He joined the <a href="Merchant%20Navy%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">merchant navy</a>, sailing mainly in small ships based in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>.

At 21 he passed his <a href="Master%20mariner%23United%20Kingdom">master's ticket</a> examinations and took over his first command, a <a href="Grimsby">Grimsby</a> trawler. During the following ten years, Orsborne said his career included "a bit of everything—rum-running, whaling, deep-sea trawling in the Arctic". In November 1935, back in Grimsby, he became skipper of the former <a href="seine%20fishing">seine fishing</a> boat "Gipsy Love," which its owners, the Marstrand Fishing Company, had converted into a trawler.

In March 1936, for his second voyage in "Gipsy Love," Orsborne attempted to engage the services of an experienced seaman, Alexander MacLean, to whom he confided that the trip might go further afield—perhaps to Bermuda or South America—but MacLean declined the opportunity. Orsborne offered the mate's berth to Harry Stone, a local seaman who did not possess a mate's ticket but was told by Orsborne that he could use MacLean's number. The other crew members were a Yorkshireman, Hector Harris, and a 17-year-old Scottish cook, Howard Stephens. The formal crew was joined by Orsborne's younger brother James, a grocer, who had no formal status on board and was later classified as a stowaway. "Gipsy Love" left Grimsby late in March 1936, supposedly to fish in the <a href="Dogger%20Bank">Dogger Bank</a> area of the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, but within hours had returned to port with engine trouble. With the consent of the owners, Orsborne transferred stores and crew to another Marstrand vessel, the small trawler "Girl Pat"; James Orsborne again joined them.

Built in 1935 in <a href="Oulton%20Broad">Oulton Broad</a>, <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>, "Girl Pat" was a vessel of 55 <a href="Gross%20register%20tonnage">gross registered tons</a> (GRT), 19 <a href="Net%20register%20tonnage">NRT</a>. She was long, with a beam of , a hold depth of , and accommodation for six. Some sources refer to her as a "seine netter," suggesting that like the "Gipsy Love" she had been converted to trawling. She was insured with underwriters for £3,000. Her regular engineer, George Jefferson, was added to Orsborne's picked crew for the forthcoming voyage.

"Girl Pat" left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, when they entered the open sea, Orsborne assembled the crew—except for Jefferson—in the wheelhouse and told them that this would not be a normal fishing trip. Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at <a href="Dover">Dover</a> where he would get rid of Jefferson, who was not included in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for <a href="pearls">pearls</a>.

On 3 April the craft reached Dover, where Jefferson was taken ashore and given food and drink. When he returned to the harbour, "Girl Pat" had departed; the engineer returned in some confusion to Grimsby. As "Girl Pat" sailed into the English Channel, Orsborne revealed to his crew that the vessel contained no charts, and that future navigation would be dependent on a cheap school atlas that he showed them. He changed details in the boat's log book, entering himself as "G. Black," Stone as "H. Clark," and James Orsborne as "A. Black". After anchoring off <a href="Jersey">Jersey</a> in the <a href="Channel%20Islands">Channel Islands</a> to await calmer weather, "Girl Pat" proceeded southwards through the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a>. Orsborne ordered changes to the boat's appearance: the <a href="bowsprit">bowsprit</a> was altered, and the fishing registration number on the side of the hull was blacked out. According to Stone, Orsborne indicated an itinerary that included <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a>, the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>, the African coast and, eventually, <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>. They might then sell the boat and share the proceeds. Severe weather in the Bay of Biscay hampered progress and battered the small vessel, and on 12 April they took shelter in the small northern Spanish port of <a href="Corcubi%C3%B3n">Corcubión</a>, where they stayed for around 14 days. Necessary repairs were carried out, and the boat was reprovisioned. Orsborne instructed that the accounts for these services, totalling £235, be sent to Marstrand's in Grimsby, as their punishment, he later said, for letting the boat be taken out with inadequate stores and equipment.

Following Jefferson's return to Grimsby, Marstrand's were puzzled by Orsborne's actions, but initially thought that he had taken on another engineer in Dover and had gone fishing, perhaps in new grounds. There were unconfirmed sightings of "Girl Pat" in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> and elsewhere. As weeks passed with no definite news, the Marstrand directors assumed that the vessel was lost, either through foundering or <a href="Barratry%20%28admiralty%20law%29">barratry</a>, and claimed insurance. They had already received sums totalling £2,400 from the underwriters, when they were surprised by the arrival of bills from Corcubión, together with the news that "Girl Pat" had sailed from the port on 24 April, her destination unknown.

After "Girl Pat" left Corcubión, there was speculation in the port that Orsborne intended to fish in the waters around <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, but there was no sighting of the vessel in that vicinity. Stone later recalled that after sailing for some time, they arrived at some uninhabited islands—this is consistent with a probable sighting by the British liner <a href="SS%20Avoceta">SS "Avoceta"</a>, which on 17 May reported seeing a vessel closely matching the trawler's description, anchored in the <a href="Savage%20Islands">Savage Islands</a>. This small uninhabited <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a>, roughly south of Madeira and roughly the same distance north of the Canary Islands, had long been associated with stories of pirates' buried treasure, and news that "Girl Pat" had been seen there gave rise to press speculation that she was engaged on a hunt for treasure. <a href="Lloyd%27s%20of%20London">Lloyd's of London</a> sent a representative to <a href="Las%20Palmas">Las Palmas</a>, to investigate the sighting; meanwhile "Girl Pat" made an unobserved call at <a href="Tenerife">Tenerife</a> in the Canary Islands, where she was repainted.

Leaving Tenerife, "Girl Pat" continued her journey southward, following the African coast. According to Stone's account, the crew went ashore at <a href="Port%20Etienne">Port Etienne</a> in <a href="French%20West%20Africa">French West Africa</a> (now Nouadhibou, in Mauritania), leaving the boat unguarded. While they were away, marauders stole gear and provisions, leaving the crew almost destitute: "All we had left to eat and drink were four bottles of water, a tin of corned beef, a bottle of lime juice and a tin of condensed milk". Leaving Port Etienne, they ran aground on a sandbank and were stranded for three days. Eventually they managed to refloat the vessel, and on 23 May were picked up by a pilot boat which brought them into the harbour at <a href="Dakar">Dakar</a>, starving and exhausted.

Stone had fallen ill with <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a> during the previous leg of the voyage; he was hospitalised in Dakar and took no further part in the adventure. Orsborne was able to obtain further fuel and water, but "Girl Pat"'s arrival attracted the attention of the local Lloyd's agent, who had been on the lookout for the vessel. On 26 May he saw Orsborne and inspected the log book, where he discovered the false names and other inconsistencies. Orsborne was asked to present the ship's papers at the British consulate but, on the pretext that he needed to test the engines, he rapidly put to sea. The appearance of "Girl Pat" in Dakar—the first confirmation since Corcubión that the vessel was still afloat—was widely reported. Relatives of the crew members were relieved that those aboard were safe but were apprehensive about what might lie ahead.

The level of public interest in the "Girl Pat" affair was enough for <a href="Gaumont%20British">Gaumont British</a> to consider making it the subject of a feature film. In <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">the House of Commons</a> on 29 May, the Parliamentary Secretary to the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a> stated that no requests had been made for the detention of the vessel in foreign ports; two weeks later, <a href="Walter%20Runciman%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Runciman%20of%20Doxford">Walter Runciman</a>, the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Business%2C%20Innovation%20and%20Skills">President of the Board of Trade</a>, confirmed that, on behalf of the underwriters, the Foreign Office had asked that "Girl Pat" be refused credit and detained on entering any port.

On 2 June the French liner "Jamaique" reported a small boat, flying the British flag and steaming southwards, near the <a href="Bissagos%20Islands">Bissagos Islands</a> south of Dakar. Although this was at first assumed to be "Girl Pat", the next reported sighting, on 9 June, was more than to the west, on the other side of the Atlantic. Captain Jones of the "Lorraine Cross," an American ship, cabled Lloyds' agents in <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Guyana">Georgetown</a>, <a href="Guyana">British Guiana</a> (now Guyana) with an account of a small ship flying a distress signal off the South American coast, north-east of <a href="Cayenne">Cayenne</a>. There were apparently four men on board. The boat's name and markings had been painted out, but she claimed to be the "Margaret Harold" bound for Trinidad from London. Jones thought the crew's behaviour suspicious, and when he asked to see the ship's papers, the ship lowered the distress signal and sped away. Jones said the vessel was "undoubtedly a British fisherman", and thought it was "Girl Pat". In Grimsby, a Marstrand spokesman expressed little surprise at this new location, and confirmed that the ship had sufficient speed to have crossed the ocean in the time since her last confirmed sighting. A check with Lloyd's indicated that there was no registered ship named "Margaret Harold".

A report from the <a href="%C3%8Eles%20du%20Salut">Îles du Salut</a>, a few miles off the coast of <a href="French%20Guiana">French Guiana</a>, indicated that a vessel similar in appearance to "Girl Pat" had watered there on 10 June. An air search, by a <a href="Pan%20American%20World%20Airways">Pan-American</a> aircraft, covered over of coastline around Georgetown, without sighting the craft. On 17 June several newspapers carried reports of the discovery of the wreck of a small boat, and three bodies, at <a href="Samana%20Cay">Atwood Cay</a>, a small island in the Bahamas. Much of the press assumed this to be "Girl Pat"; one headline read "Did School Atlas Course Lead Crew to Death?". The reports proved false when, early in the morning of 19 June, a police launch towed "Girl Pat" into Georgetown harbour. 

On the evening of 18 June the British steamer "Arakaka" had spotted a small ship a few miles outside Georgetown, and radioed this information to the shore. An unarmed police launch left Georgetown to investigate; as they approached, the crew of the as yet unidentified vessel became hostile. They denied that she was "Girl Pat" and threatened violence should officers attempt to board her. The launch retreated to Georgetown, where the police armed themselves and obtained authority to seize the suspect vessel. They returned early the following morning to find that their quarry was departing. A two-hour chase ensued, which "The Hull Daily Mail" glamorised as a sporting contest: "Like some coursing <a href="greyhound">greyhound</a> the faster Government ship stuck to the tail of the fleeing suspect which, harelike, doubled back on her course to dodge her pursuer". According to the British "<a href="Morning%20Star%20%28British%20newspaper%29">Daily Worker</a>", the chase "[outdid] the most spectacular efforts of film directors". Finally, while manoeuvring at close quarters, the vessels collided. The stern of the suspect boat was severely damaged, whereupon she surrendered and was taken in tow. The name displayed on the vessel's hull was "Kia-ora", but Stephens quickly admitted to their captors that the ship was "Girl Pat".

With "Girl Pat" secured and under guard in Georgetown harbour, the Orsborne brothers, Harris, and Stephens were taken to police headquarters in the City Hall. The police issued a statement that the four were there "at their own request. They are under no form of detention". In London, officials struggled to establish the exact legal position, and issued confusing statements. Meanwhile, Orsborne and his companions were widely hailed as heroes. The German newspaper "Hamburger Fremdenblatt" asked: "Is this not a bit of British tradition, to do the unconventional out of love for adventure, if great personal risks, audacity and romance are connected therewith?". A man from the town of <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a> thought the adventure demonstrated "the spirit of <a href="Francis%20Drake">Drake</a>", and called for a public subscription to meet the crew's debts and expenses. An alternative view, expressed in the "Hull Daily Mail," was to question whether the men should be regarded so favourably, or merely as "men who have run away with someone else's property".

Once released by the police, Harris and Stephens returned immediately to England, where they arrived on 13 July. The Orsborne brothers waited in Georgetown for their position to be clarified; George Orsborne told the press he was anxious to return home where, he insisted, many job offers were open to him. On 27 June, following further discussions in London, the brothers were arrested on a warrant issued under the <a href="Fugitive%20Offenders%20Act%201881">Fugitive Offenders Act</a>, and brought before the Georgetown magistrates, where they were charged with the theft of "Girl Pat".

The brothers were held in custody, awaiting a deportation hearing. On 4 July they were remanded for a further week, and bail was again refused. Although the brothers declared their willingness to waive the deportation process and accept immediate transfer to England, they continued to be detained. On 22 July the hearings in the Georgetown magistrates' court finally began, with the formal identification of "Girl Pat". On 24 July the magistrates ordered that the brothers be sent to England to face trial, once the formal approval of the colonial governor, <a href="Geoffry%20Northcote">Sir Geoffry Northcote</a>, had been given. The governor was in no hurry to act; the Orsbornes finally left Georgetown on 13 August, when they boarded the <a href="cargo%20liner">cargo liner</a> .

While the Orsbornes were in Georgetown, Harold Stone, "Girl Pat"'s erstwhile mate, made his way home from Dakar and arrived in Liverpool on 20 July. After interviews with the police, Stone spoke to the press of the hardships suffered during the "Girl Pat" voyage, especially the shortages of food and water: "I would not want to go through the experience again". He confirmed that they had navigated using a school atlas, but added that they had possessed a compass.

Early on 2 September "Inanda" docked at <a href="Gravesend%2C%20Kent">Gravesend, Kent</a>. The brothers were immediately driven to London for a formal appearance at <a href="Bow%20Street%20Magistrates%27%20Court">Bow Street Magistrates' Court</a>, where they were charged with theft and conspiracy. Against police opposition—because, they said, "certain developments" might arise—the magistrate bailed each defendant in the sum of £500, and required them to surrender their passports.

When the hearing resumed on 10 September, the court heard from Marstrands' managing director that George Orsborne had not been given authority to operate "Girl Pat" outside the North Sea. Stone testified that Orsborne had made plain his intentions to take the boat south from the outset, and also gave evidence concerning the changes to the ship's log. The court heard from Jefferson and other Dover witnesses, from Alexander MacLean, and from the Lloyd's agent in Dakar. The defence counsel did not answer the detailed aspects of the prosecution's case, but stated that at the forthcoming trial, "very serious allegations" would be made against certain of the prosecution witnesses. The brothers pleaded not guilty, and were remanded on continuing bail for trial at the <a href="Old%20Bailey">Old Bailey</a>. In the interval between the Bow Street hearings and the trial, which was set to begin in October, "Girl Pat" was sold.

The Old Bailey trial began on 19 October 1936. The prosecution opened by stating that this should not be considered as "a cheerful buccaneering adventure," but as a breach of trust on the part of George Orsborne, to whom the owners had entrusted their ship. The objective of the voyage had not been to benefit the owners, but to make money for the defendants.

MacLean testified that in his discussions with George Orsborne, he had formed the impression that the captain was part-owner of the vessel. Orsborne had mentioned to him the possibility of engaging in profitable activities such as gun-running and smuggling. John Moore, the managing director of Marstrand's, stated that he had expected Orsborne to take "Girl Pat" fishing in an area of the North Sea where another Marstrand vessel was fishing successfully. When Moore was cross-examined, the defence's "serious allegations" were revealed. It was put to Moore that he had instructed George Orsborne not to go fishing, but to get rid of the vessel so that the company could claim its insurance value, of which Orsborne would be rewarded with a share. The defence alleged that the company was in poor financial shape, and that its ships were heavily mortgaged. Moore denied that he had made any such suggestion to Orsborne. The company, he insisted, was financially sound, the mortgages on its vessels were relatively low, and he had never discussed insured values with Orsborne. The defence further alleged that when taken out "Girl Pat" had been in an unseaworthy condition, inadequately provisioned and unfit for a normal fishing voyage. This suggestion was also denied by Moore.

After Stone and Jefferson reprised the evidence they had given in Bow Street, George Orsborne took the stand. He said he had not agreed to Moore's proposal to "lose" the vessel, and after departing with "Girl Pat" had still been undecided about what he would do. He had left Jefferson in Dover because he was a poor mechanic and a drunk. Moore, he asserted, was mistaken in claiming that the boat's provisions and equipment were adequate. Orsborne said that while the boat was sheltering in Jersey, he had suggested to the crew that they "may as well make a holiday of it", and then proposed that they make a circle of the Atlantic Ocean before returning to Grimsby. There was no intention to fall in with Moore's scheme or to steal the vessel; they would "thank the owners for the loan of the ship" and return it. Orsborne added that while they were in port at Corcubión, he was offered money for "Girl Pat", but turned it down. Orsborne denied that he had tried to conceal his or the boat's true identity in Dakar, or had left the port to avoid enquiries—the sudden departure was due, he said, to troubles with the natives. Nor had he attempted to evade the authorities in Georgetown; his movements there had arisen from concern for the safety of his vessel, which was being jeopardised by the manoeuvres of the police launch.

James Orsborne, giving evidence, said that he had learned from his brother about Moore's proposal to get rid of the boat, and had told George that he would be "a darned fool" even to consider the suggestion. He had stayed with his brother because "I thought that if he was going to do anything crazy I might manage to prevent him". Recalled to the witness box, Moore said that he had refused to employ James Orsborne because he considered him dishonest.

In his closing speech, defence counsel said that the key to the case was whether the Orsborne brothers intended to deprive the owners permanently of their vessel. The evidence, he said, was more suggestive of a "joy-ride half-way round the world", than of theft or anything more sinister. Prosecuting counsel argued that if the month's joy-ride was the innocent explanation, why had it been necessary to introduce into the case the unfounded allegations of proposed insurance fraud "against men whose reputations were above suspicion?". In his summing up, the judge condemned the arrangements whereby the Orsbornes were receiving money from the press for the rights to their story. This was unwarranted and undesirable: "Whether the two prisoners be guilty or innocent [of theft], the property of someone else was being used by them without permission ...George Orsborne clearly knew that he was acting directly against his employer's interests". The jury was out for only 35 minutes before returning guilty verdicts against both defendants. On 22 October George Orsborne was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment, and James to 12 months.

Thirteen years after the trial, in a memoir entitled "Master of the Girl Pat" published by Doubleday, George Orsborne provided a new context for the "Girl Pat" voyage. According to this narrative, he had been recruited in 1935 to work for <a href="Naval%20Intelligence%20Division">British Naval Intelligence</a>. The "Girl Pat" venture was a secret assignment, connected with the imminent <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. Between the stops at Corcubión and Dakar, Orsborne claims, he carried out a mission to blow up a railway bridge in <a href="Spanish%20Morocco">Spanish Morocco</a>. The stops at Port Etienne, Dakar and elsewhere had been to receive further instructions from Naval Intelligence. In this later account Orsborne changes crew names and other details: Stone becomes "Fletcher", and his leaving the voyage in Dakar is recorded by Orsborne as a "desertion". Some of Orsborne's dates are inconsistent with the boat's known movements—he gives 26 June as the date of arrival in Dakar, and the account he gives of his Old Bailey trial bears no relation to the published record. Orsborne describes his stay in <a href="Wormwood%20Scrubs">Wormwood Scrubs</a> prison as "a wonderful experience. I wouldn't have missed it for anything".

After the trial, the press and public remained broadly sympathetic to the Orsborne brothers. During the committal stages "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>" had commented that the adventure "had given romantic satisfaction to the whole world" and that her captain had become a national hero. On the day after the sentencing, "The Times" leading article noted the public's sustained pleasure in the escapade. Nearly 30 years later, in his social history of the between-the-wars years, <a href="Ronald%20Blythe">Ronald Blythe</a> portrayed the affair as an anti-establishment gesture, "a colourful snook cocked in the face of some of the most soul-crippling officialdom ever experienced by ordinary men and women".

While in prison, George Orsborne lent his name to a ghost-written account of the "Girl Pat" adventure, which repeated the claim that the vessel had been sent out inadequately equipped and provisioned. Marstrand's successfully sued the publishers, Hutchinsons, and two newspapers which had repeated the details. On his release, Orsborne planned to make a single-handed transatlantic crossing in an open boat, but the trip was delayed, and finally cancelled when war began in September 1939. Likewise, nothing came of an announcement in 1938 that Orsborne would lead an expedition to the Caribbean and up the Amazon.

During the war, Orsborne worked as mate on a trawler which formed part of Britain's anti-invasion force, before rejoining the Royal Navy. His wartime exploits included service as a beachmaster during the <a href="Normandy%20landings">Normandy landings</a> of June 1944, a spell as a <a href="commando">commando</a> in <a href="Combined%20Operations%20Headquarters">Combined Operations</a>, and service in the Far East, where he records being captured and imprisoned by the Japanese. In September 1947 Orsborne was one of two men rescued in mid-Atlantic from the abandoned <a href="ketch">ketch</a> "Lovely Lady"; the other was a stowaway, a Spanish greengrocer.

In his 1949 memoir "Master of the Girl Pat", George Orsborne records briefly that Stephens went straight back to sea after the adventure, that Harris drank up his share of the crew's newspaper money, and that "Fletcher" (Stone) emigrated to Australia. James Orsborne worked for a while in the Mediterranean, assisting refugees from the Spanish Civil War. Later he went to Canada. He was in Singapore when it <a href="Battle%20of%20Singapore">fell to the Japanese</a> in February 1942, and was not heard from again. George Orsborne died on 23 December 1957, at <a href="Belle%20%C3%8Ele">Belle Île</a> off the <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> coast, while delivering a motor-cruiser from <a href="Nice">Nice</a> to England.

"Girl Pat" was repaired and refitted in Georgetown by her new owners, the Grimsby-based firm Girl Pat Ltd, and was brought back to England, arriving at <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> on 9 May 1937 She remained there for two weeks as a tourist attraction, before moving to London on 28 May. Her new owners declared that they were still undecided as to the ship's longer-term future, but for the time being she would be displayed at Blackpool and other holiday resorts. On 17 February 1939 "The Times" reported that "Girl Pat" had been sold to the <a href="Port%20of%20London%20Authority">Port of London Authority</a> (PLA), to be used as a wreck-marking vessel. After the outbreak of war in September 1939, she was requisitioned by the Admiralty for naval use, and is listed as one of the "minor war vessels" in service in July 1940. By 1945 she had been returned to the PLA; there is no public record of her subsequent history. The name "Girl Pat" was adopted by at least one later registered vessel; in August 1966 a 60-ton yacht of that name was arrested by Greek coastguards in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Corinth">Gulf of Corinth</a> and its occupants charged with the theft of antiquities.

St. Elmo (1914 film)

St. Elmo is a 1914 American <a href="silent%20film">silent</a> <a href="drama%20film">drama film</a> produced by the <a href="Balboa%20Amusement%20Producing%20Company">Balboa Amusement Producing Company</a> and distributed by <a href="William%20Fox%20%28producer%29">William Fox</a>'s <a href="Box%20Office%20Attractions%20Company">Box Office Attractions Company</a>. It was the first <a href="feature-length">feature-length</a> film adaptation of <a href="Augusta%20Jane%20Evans">Augusta Jane Evans</a>'s 1866 <a href="St.%20Elmo%20%28novel%29">novel of the same name</a>. The story follows the life of the title character (played by William Jossey), who kills his cousin (<a href="Francis%20McDonald">Francis McDonald</a>) over the love of Agnes (Madeline Pardee), falls from grace, and eventually finds redemption and love with Edna (<a href="Gypsy%20Abbott">Gypsy Abbott</a>). It is disputed who directed the film; many sources credit <a href="Bertram%20Bracken">Bertram Bracken</a>, while others list "St. Elmo" as <a href="J.%20Gordon%20Edwards">J. Gordon Edwards</a>'s directorial debut.

Some reviewers praised the scenery and overall production quality, considering the film an improvement over staged adaptations of the novel. Others found the scenery irrelevant and the story confusing. Despite mixed reviews, the film was financially successful, reportedly setting box office records. The following year, a film adaptation of an unrelated Evans novel, "Beulah", was marketed as a sequel. As with most Balboa films, "St. Elmo" is now believed <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>.

St. Elmo Murray and Murray Hammond, his cousin and best friend, are both in love with a young woman named Agnes Hunt. Although Agnes loves Murray, she rejects him for being too poor. Instead, she accepts the wealthy St. Elmo's marriage proposal. St. Elmo's mother holds a ball to celebrate the engagement. After the betrothal is publicly announced, Murray and Agnes meet covertly in the gardens. St. Elmo discovers their affair, challenges Murray to a duel, and kills his cousin with the first shot. The Devil possesses St. Elmo, and he becomes a cruel wanderer, spreading misery and misfortune where he travels.

Twenty years later, the <a href="Ingenue%20%28stock%20character%29">ingenue</a> Edna Earle is traveling by train, hoping to find employment in a cotton mill after the death of her father, the village blacksmith. The train derails, and St. Elmo saves her from the burning wreckage. This act sets St. Elmo on the path to salvation as he and Edna slowly fall in love. Initially planning to depart for distant lands, a vision of Christ leads him to aid the impoverished. Freed from the Devil, he becomes a minister and marries Edna.


<a href="Augusta%20Jane%20Evans">Augusta Jane Evans</a>'s 1866 <a href="domestic%20novel">domestic novel</a> "St. Elmo" was one of the best-selling novels of the 19th century, surpassed at the time only by "<a href="Uncle%20Tom%27s%20Cabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a>", and later by "". With the novel's success came broad cultural impact. Various consumer products, hotels, steamboats, railway carriages, and even several towns were named after the book, and many families named children after its characters. Although there was considerable interest in a <a href="theatrical%20adaptation">theatrical adaptation</a>, Evans was concerned about how the novel's themes would be portrayed on the stage and did not approve the first script for a "St. Elmo" play until 1909. Other stage versions, many of which were financially successful, were quickly developed after her death later that year. The first film versions of the story followed shortly. In 1910, the <a href="Thanhouser%20Company">Thanhouser Company</a> chose "St. Elmo" for its <a href="St.%20Elmo%20%281910%20Thanhouser%20film%29">second production</a>, and <a href="Vitagraph%20Studios">Vitagraph Studios</a> produced <a href="St.%20Elmo%20%281910%20Vitagraph%20film%29">its own adaptation</a> the same year. Both were one-reel <a href="short%20films">short films</a>.

In 1914, while working for the <a href="Balboa%20Amusement%20Producing%20Company">Balboa Amusement Producing Company</a>, William Jossey wrote the screenplay for the first <a href="feature%20film">feature-length</a> film adaptation. Filming took place in <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach, California</a>, where the Balboa studios were located. Footage of an actual church under construction across the street from the studio was used for a scene in which one was built by St. Elmo. Contemporary writers credited <a href="Bertram%20Bracken">Bertram Bracken</a> as director, as do some modern sources, including the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a>. Others consider the film the directorial debut of <a href="J.%20Gordon%20Edwards">J. Gordon Edwards</a>. Both men subsequently had long careers directing for <a href="Fox%20Film">Fox Film</a>.

Balboa highlighted the film's production value and artistry in its marketing; its <a href="film%20poster">film poster</a> advertises "194 gorgeous scenes". However, Balboa was not a film distributor, so in May 1914 they contracted with <a href="William%20Fox%20%28producer%29">William Fox</a>'s <a href="Box%20Office%20Attractions%20Company">Box Office Attractions Company</a> to have Fox handle the distribution of all Balboa films, beginning with "St. Elmo". Copies of these films were then shown at Fox's theaters or rented out to other theater franchise owners, in what was known as the states' rights distribution system. On 1 February 1915, William Fox incorporated Fox Film, which inherited Box Office's assets. The new company continued to distribute some Box Office films, including "St. Elmo", which played in some areas into 1916.

Contemporary reviews were mixed. Writing for "<a href="Motion%20Picture%20News">Motion Picture News</a>", A. Danson Michell found the film superior to stage adaptations of the novel, and especially praised the photography. "<a href="Moving%20Picture%20World">Moving Picture World</a>" Hanford Judson also gave a generally positive review, believing that its production qualities and popular appeal more than compensated for the "artificiality" of a few scenes. Not all critics praised the film. Vanderheyden Fyles of "Movie Pictorial" felt the Long Beach scenery lauded elsewhere was irrelevant to the plot and the adapted story was a "baffling mix-up". A particularly negative review appeared in "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>", suggesting the film was so bad that its makers "might have got a little profit out of the raw [film] by not ruining it through putting "St. Elmo" on it." The Chicago Board of <a href="Film%20censorship%20in%20the%20United%20States">Censorship</a> found some scenes objectionable and required that Chicago showings of the film be edited to remove depictions of dueling and Murray's dead body.

"St. Elmo" was a financial success, reported by "The Photoplayers' Weekly" as breaking box office records. The following year, Bertram Bracken directed a film adaptation of another Augusta Jane Evans novel, "Beulah" (1859), for Balboa. Though not directly related to "St. Elmo", the 1915 "Beulah" film was marketed as a sequel. In 1923, Fox Film produced <a href="St.%20Elmo%20%281923%20American%20film%29">another adaptation</a> of the novel, also titled "St. Elmo", which was also a success.

Around 90% of Balboa's films have been <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>, probably including the 1914 "St. Elmo". The <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> is not aware of any extant copies.

Irataba

Irataba (<a href="Mojave%20language">Mohave</a>: "eecheeyara tav" , also known as "Yara tav", "Yarate:va", "Arateve";  – 1874) was a leader of the <a href="Mohave%20people">Mohave Nation</a>, known for his role as a mediator between his people and the United States. He was born near the <a href="Colorado%20River">Colorado River</a> in present-day <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>. Irataba was a renowned <a href="orator">orator</a> and one of the first Mohave to speak English, a skill he used to develop relations with the United States.

Irataba first encountered <a href="European%20American">European American</a>s in 1851, when he assisted the <a href="Sitgreaves%20Expedition">Sitgreaves Expedition</a>. In 1854, he met <a href="Amiel%20Weeks%20Whipple">Amiel Whipple</a>, then leading an expedition crossing the Colorado. Several Mohave aided the group, and Irataba agreed to escort them through the territory of the <a href="Southern%20Paiute">Paiute</a> to the <a href="Old%20Spanish%20Trail%20%28trade%20route%29">Old Spanish Trail</a>, which would take them to southern California. Noted for his large physical size and gentle demeanor, he later helped and protected other expeditions, earning him a reputation among whites as the most important native leader in the region.

Against Irataba's advice, in 1858 Mohave warriors attacked the first emigrant <a href="wagon%20train">wagon train</a> to use <a href="Beale%27s%20Wagon%20Road">Beale's Wagon Road</a> through Mohave country. As a result, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">U.S. War Department</a> sent a detachment under <a href="William%20Hoffman%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">Colonel William Hoffman</a> to pacify the tribe. Following a series of confrontations known as the <a href="Mohave%20War">Mohave War</a>, Hoffman succeeded in dominating the natives, and demanded that they allow the passage of settlers through their territory. To ensure compliance, <a href="Fort%20Mohave">Fort Mohave</a> was constructed near the site of the battle in April 1859. Hoffman also imprisoned several Mohave leaders. Having been an advocate for friendly relations with the whites, Irataba became the nation's "Aha macave yaltanack", an elected, as opposed to hereditary, leader.

As a result of his many interactions with U.S. officials and settlers, Irataba was invited to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, in 1864, for an official meeting with members of the U.S. military and its government, including President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. In doing so, he became the first Native American from the Southwest to meet an American president. He received considerable attention during his tours of the U.S. capital, and of New York City and Philadelphia, where he was given gifts, including a silver-headed cane from Lincoln. Upon his return he negotiated the creation of the <a href="Colorado%20River%20Indian%20Reservation">Colorado River Indian Reservation</a>, which caused a split in the Mohave Nation when he led several hundred of his supporters to the Colorado River valley. The majority of the Mohave preferred to remain in their ancestral homelands near Fort Mohave and under the leadership of their hereditary leader, <a href="Homoseh%20quahote">Homoseh quahote</a>, who was less enthusiastic about direct collaboration with whites. As leader of the Colorado River band of Mohave, Irataba encouraged peaceful relations with whites, served as a mediator between the warring tribes in the area, and during his later years continued to lead the Mohave in their ongoing conflicts with the <a href="Paiute">Paiute</a> and <a href="Chemehuevi">Chemehuevi</a>.

Some consider Irataba a great leader who championed peace, but others feel he should have done more to defend the Mohave way of life. The Irataba Society, a non-profit charity run by the <a href="Colorado%20River%20Indian%20Tribes">Colorado River Indian Tribes</a>, was established in 1970 in <a href="Parker%2C%20Arizona">Parker, Arizona</a>, where a sports venue, <a href="Irataba%20Hall">Irataba Hall</a>, is also named after him. In 2002, the US <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a> designated in the <a href="Eldorado%20Mountains">Eldorado Mountains</a> as <a href="Ireteba%20Peaks%20Wilderness">Ireteba Peaks Wilderness</a>. In March 2015, Mohave Tribal chairman <a href="Dennis%20Patch">Dennis Patch</a> credited Irataba with ensuring that "the Mohaves stayed on land they had lived on since time immemorial."

Irataba's name, also rendered as Ireteba, Yara tav, Arateve, Yarate:va, and Yiratewa, derives from the <a href="Mojave%20language">Mohave language</a> phrase "eecheeyara tav", which means "beautiful bird". He was born into the "Neolge", or Sun Fire clan of the <a href="Mohave%20people">Mohave Nation</a> . He lived near a rock formation that gave its name to <a href="Needles%2C%20California">Needles</a>, south of where the <a href="Grand%20Canyon">Grand Canyon</a> empties into the <a href="Mohave%20Canyon">Mohave Canyon</a> in present-day Arizona, near the Nevada and California border. The Mohave lived in houses along the riverbank in the <a href="Mohave%20Valley">Mohave Valley</a>, during winter in half-buried dwellings built with <a href="Populus%20sect.%20Aigeiros">cottonwood</a> logs and <a href="arrowweed">arrowweed</a> covered in earth, and in the summer in open-air flat-roofed houses called "<a href="Ramada%20%28shelter%29">ramada</a>s".

In the mid-19th century, the Mohave were composed of three geographical groups; Irataba was the hereditary leader of the "Huttoh Pah" group, who lived near the east bank of the <a href="Colorado%20River">Colorado River</a> and occupied the central portion of the <a href="Mohave%20Valley">Mohave Valley</a>. Mohave government consisted of a loose system of hereditary clan leaders with a head of the entire nation. They were often involved in conflicts with the <a href="Chemehuevi">Chemehuevi</a>, <a href="Southern%20Paiute">Paiute</a>, and <a href="Maricopa%20people">Maricopa people</a>s. Irataba was a member of the Mohave warrior society called "kwanami", who led groups of warriors in battle and were dedicated to defending their lands and people.

Little is known of Irataba's family relations, except for the name of his son Tekse thume, and his nephews Qolho qorau (Irataba's sister's son who succeeded him as leader) and Aspamekelyeho. <a href="Olive%20Oatman">Olive Oatman</a>, who lived with the Mohave for five years, later stated that Irataba was the brother of the former chief, presumably Cairook, with whom Irataba clearly had a close relation. One anecdotal description states that Irataba had several wives, among them a <a href="Hualapai">Hualapai</a> woman who had been taken as a captive and who is also described as having a young son. He also had at least one daughter, the mother of his granddaughter Tcatc who was interviewed in the 1950s. She stated that Irataba had wanted to leave his land deeds and medals to his brother's sons, but that they were eventually lost.

In contemporary accounts Irataba was described as an eloquent speaker, and linguist <a href="Leanne%20Hinton">Leanne Hinton</a> suggests that he was among the first Mohave people to become fluent in English, which he learned through his many interactions with Anglo-Americans. Like many Mohave men, Irataba was very tall, particularly by 19th-century standards; the United States Army estimated his height at in 1861. American author <a href="Albert%20S.%20Evans">Albert S. Evans</a>, writing in "<a href="Overland%20Monthly">The Overland Monthly</a>", referred to him as "the old desert giant". Edward Carlson, a soldier based at <a href="Fort%20Mohave">Fort Mohave</a> who knew Irataba well in the 1860s, described him as having a powerful frame, but also a "very gentle" and "kind ... demeanor".

Irataba lived through a tumultuous period of Mohave history where the people went from being a politically independent nation to coming under the political control of the United States, and the events surrounding his role in these encounters are well documented. Most historical sources for the life of Irataba come from descriptions by white explorers or government agents with whom he interacted, or from contemporary newspapers that reported on his visits to the East Coast and California, and on the conflicts in Arizona territory. Some Mohave versions of the events also exist: in the early 20th century anthropologist <a href="A.%20L.%20Kroeber">A. L. Kroeber</a> interviewed Jo Nelson (Mohave: Chooksa homar), a Mohave man who participated in many of the events and knew Irataba personally; another version was told to <a href="ethnographer">ethnographer</a> <a href="George%20Devereux">George Devereux</a> by Irataba's granddaughter Tcatc, and versions recounted by members of the Fort Mohave band of Mohave, the descendants of Homoseh quahote, were recorded by ethnographer <a href="Lorraine%20Sherer">Lorraine Sherer</a> during the 1950s and 1960s.

Irataba assisted Captain <a href="Lorenzo%20Sitgreaves">Lorenzo Sitgreaves</a> during his 1851 <a href="Sitgreaves%20Expedition">exploration of the Colorado</a>. On March 19, 1851, a family of <a href="Church%20of%20Christ%20%28Brewsterite%29">Brewsterite</a> settlers, the Oatmans, who were traveling by wagon train in what is now Arizona, were <a href="Oatman%20massacre">attacked</a> by a band of Western <a href="Yavapai%20people">Yavapai</a>, probably the <a href="Tolkepaya">Tolkepaya</a>. They captured two survivors of the attack: the 14-year-old <a href="Olive%20Oatman">Olive Oatman</a> and her 7-year-old sister, Mary Ann. After a year with the Yavapai, the girls were sold to the Mohave, and adopted into the Oach clan where they lived with the family of a Mohave man called Tokwatha (Musk Melon) a friend of Irataba. Olive remained with the Mohave until February 22, 1856, when Tokwatha, having been warned that having a white girl among them might be seen as an offense by whites, brought her to <a href="Fort%20Yuma">Fort Yuma</a> carpenter <a href="Henry%20Grinnell">Henry Grinnell</a>, releasing her in return for two horses and some blankets and beads. Irataba may have learned about Anglo-Americans and their society from Oatman, and knowing her may have contributed to his generally favourable disposition towards Whites.

On February 23, 1854, Irataba, <a href="Cairook">Cairook</a>, and other Mohave people encountered <a href="Whipple%20Expedition">an expedition</a> led by military officers <a href="Amiel%20Weeks%20Whipple">Amiel Whipple</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Christmas%20Ives">J.C. Ives</a>, as the group approached the Colorado en route to California. Whipple and his men counted six hundred Mohave gathered near their camp, trading corn, beans, <a href="squash%20%28plant%29">squash (plant)</a>, and wheat for beads and <a href="calico">calico</a>. By the end of their commerce, the party had purchased six bushels of corn and two hundred pounds of flour. The Mohave played a traditional game played with a hoop and pole, and the two groups entertained themselves with target practice, the Mohave using bows and arrows and the whites firing pistols and rifles. When the expedition had difficulty crossing the Colorado on February 27, several Mohave jumped into the water and helped salvage the supplies.

Irataba and Cairook agreed to escort the group across the territory of the Paiute to the <a href="Old%20Spanish%20Trail%20%28trade%20route%29">Old Spanish Trail</a> that would take them to southern California. German artist <a href="Balduin%20M%C3%B6llhausen">Balduin Möllhausen</a> accompanied the Whipple expedition, and made drawings of several Mohave, including Irataba. Möllhausen's drawings were featured in Ives' 1861 congressional report, making Irataba "among the first "named" likenesses of California Indians ever published".

In February 1858, Ives returned to the area in a <a href="paddle%20steamer">paddle steamer</a> named "Explorer". He was leading an expedition up the Colorado from the south, and he wanted Irataba to guide them. The Mohave gave permission to navigate the river, and Cairook, Irataba, and a 16-year-old Mohave boy named Nahvahroopa joined them. Möllhausen again accompanied the expedition, and was impressed with the Mohave guides, later noting Irataba's enthusiastic handshake and lamenting that their only form of communication was sign language. He also noted that Irataba and the Mohave readily began wearing European clothes given to them by members of the expedition, and showed great interest in <a href="smoking%20tobacco">smoking tobacco</a>. Aside from the friendship shown to him by Irataba and Cairook, Ives noted that the Mohave appeared less friendly than on earlier occasions, a change that he attributed to their contact with <a href="Mormon">Mormon</a>s, who were in conflict with the US and had succeeded in converting some Mohave.

Irataba guided the party into the Mohave Canyon, indicating the location of rapids and advising the "Explorer" pilot of convenient places to anchor while camping for the night. When they reached the entrance to the <a href="Black%20Canyon%20of%20the%20Colorado">Black Canyon of the Colorado</a>, the ship crashed against a submerged rock, throwing several men overboard, dislodging the <a href="boiler">boiler</a>, and damaging the <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">wheelhouse</a>. Using their <a href="skiff">skiff</a>, the crew towed the "Explorer" to the shore, where they camped for three days while repairing the vessel. The expedition had relied on beans and corn provided by the Mohave during the previous weeks; as their supplies dwindled they grew increasingly anxious about the arrival of a resupply pack train from Fort Yuma. Irataba volunteered to hike towards the Mohave Valley to try to locate the supplies that had been requested several days earlier. He also warned that the expedition was being watched by Paiutes.

When Irataba returned he informed Ives that he would not venture any deeper into the territory of the <a href="Hualapai">Hualapai</a>s, but agreed to help them locate friendly guides in the region before parting company. Irataba was reluctant to venture into the canyon because he feared the party would be ambushed by Paiutes aligned with Mormons. After enlisting three Hualapai guides, Irataba prepared to take his leave from the expedition and return to the Mohave community. On April 4, the Mohave received payment for their services; Möllhausen described the exchange: "Lieutenant Ives informed Irataba that he had been authorized by the 'Great Grandfather in Washington' to give him two mules ... for his loyalty and his trustworthiness so that he could take his possessions and those of his companions more conveniently to his home valley." The next morning, as they were preparing to leave: "Irataba was visibly moved ... and in his sincere eyes expressed so much honesty and loyalty as can only be found in an unspoiled nature ... I maintain that there was not one in our expedition who did not feel a certain sadness to see this huge man with ... a harmless soul leave."

Following their experiences with the Sitgreaves and Whipple expeditions, and encounters with Mormons and the soldiers at Fort Yuma, the Mohave were aware that whites were immigrating to the region in increasing numbers. It was difficult for the Mohave to predict the behavior of the arriving whites, some of whom, like Whipple, were amiably disposed towards them, whereas others such as the Mormons were hostile. The kwanami were divided on how the situation should be approached; some advocated an aggressive posture, denying whites all passage through their territory, but others, including Irataba, preferred a peaceful approach, or even an alliance with them that could put the Mohave in a stronger position relative to their traditional enemies the Paiute, Chemehuevi, and Walapai.

On September 1, 1857, a joint force of Mohave and Quechan warriors launched a major attack with hundreds of warriors on a Maricopa village close to <a href="Maricopa%20Wells%2C%20Arizona">Maricopa Wells, Arizona</a>, on the <a href="Gila%20river">Gila river</a>. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Pima%20Butte">Battle of Pima Butte</a> was described by a group of white mail carriers who witnessed it. They stated that the battle was fought mostly with clubs, as well as bows and arrows, and that probably more than 100 warriors died, most of them from the attacking party. It is unknown whether Irataba participated in the attack, but given his status as kwanami, it is likely that he did. The battle has been described as the last major battle involving only Native American nations. This defeat put the Mohave on the defensive, wary of the possibility that whites would take this moment of weakness as an opportunity to begin settling on tribal lands.

In October 1857, an expedition led by <a href="Edward%20Fitzgerald%20Beale">Edward Fitzgerald Beale</a> was tasked with establishing a trade route along the <a href="35th%20parallel%20north">35th parallel</a> from <a href="Fort%20Smith%2C%20Arkansas">Fort Smith</a>, Arkansas, to <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, California. From Fort Smith, his journey continued through <a href="Fort%20Defiance%2C%20Arizona">Fort Defiance, Arizona</a>, before crossing the Colorado near Needles, California. This route became known as <a href="Beale%27s%20Wagon%20Road">Beale's Wagon Road</a>, and the location where Beale crossed the river as Beale's Crossing. Beale's journal and subsequent report to the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">United States Secretary of War</a> did not mention any problems with Irataba and the Mohave, but an assistant named Humphrey Stacy recorded that the Mohave had prevented Beale from traveling downriver.

In 1858, the <a href="Rose%E2%80%93Baley%20Party">Rose–Baley Party</a> comprising at least a hundred settlers with wagons and a large herd of cattle, was the first emigrant train to venture onto Beale's Wagon Road. Upon entering Mohave territory the settlers started cutting down cottonwood trees, which were an important resource for the Mohave. The most warlike of the kwanamis organized an attack on the party, and drove away and slaughtered many of the party's cattle. On August 30, three hundred Mohave warriors attacked the emigrants but were repelled, with one member of the party killed in battle and eleven wounded. Another family who were not with the main party during the attack were killed in an event that has often been blamed on the Mohave, but which in <a href="William%20Hoffman%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">Colonel William Hoffman</a>'s opinion was more likely carried out by a band of Walapai, along with seven renegade Mohave. The emigrants killed seventeen Mohave warriors. The incident was widely publicized in the media and labeled "a massacre", scaring many white Californians who feared being cut off from the eastern US by hostile natives, and it motivated the War Department to quickly subjugate the tribe.

Irataba was away at Fort Yuma during the attack on the settlers, and upon hearing of it he scolded the Mohave. Chooksa homar participated in the events and reported that Irataba told the warriors, "I hear you fought, though I told you not to. And you will have war again: I know it. You used to fight the Maricopa. I want to go [to Phoenix] to see the Maricopa and tell them: 'The Mohave will not come any more to attack you'." Irataba, weary of the constant fighting and worried that further conflicts with neighboring tribes would draw more attention from the US soldiers, organized a peace expedition to the Maricopa, settling the ancient disputes between the two peoples.

When news of the attack reached California, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">US War Department</a> decided to establish a military fort at Beale's Crossing to keep the Mohave under control and secure white travelers safe passage through Mohave lands. On December 26, 1858, Hoffman and fifty <a href="dragoon">dragoon</a>s from <a href="Fort%20Tejon">Fort Tejon</a> were dispatched to cross the desert and confront the Mohave. Irataba attempted to arrange a peaceful meeting, but Hoffman ordered his troops to fire on the warriors, who counterattacked and repelled the force. He returned in April 1859, by way of Fort Yuma, with four <a href="company%20%28military%20unit%29">companies</a> of the <a href="6th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">6th Infantry Regiment</a>. When they arrived at Beale's Crossing, the Mohave decided against attacking the army of five hundred soldiers. On April 23, at Hoffman's request, he and his officers met with several hundred Mohave warriors and their leaders. The indigenous leaders included Cairook, Irataba, <a href="Homoseh%20quahote">Homoseh quahote</a> (also called Seck-a-hoot and Asika hota), and Pascual, leader of the Quechan. During the meeting the Mohave were surrounded by armed soldiers who prevented them from leaving.

Hoffman gave the Mohave a choice between war and peace, and he demanded that they agree to never again harm white settlers along the wagon trail. He also declared that, as punishment, the Mohave were required to surrender as hostages a member of each clan and three warriors who had taken part in the attack. Hoffman demanded that the chief who had ordered the attack on the settlers offer himself up as a hostage. According to Chooksa homar, the chief who had ordered the attack was Homoseh quahote, who was reluctant to give himself up. Cairook offered himself in his place, along with eight others, including Tokwatha, Irataba's son Tekse thume, and Irataba's nephews Qolho qorau, and Aspamekelyeho. Other hostages were named Itsere-'itse, Ilyhanapau, and Tinyam-isalye. They were transported in the river steamer "General Jessup" to Fort Yuma. Many soldiers remained to begin construction on the Beale's Crossing fort, which was named Fort Mohave. Although Irataba visited the garrison several times and argued for their release, the hostages were held for more than a year. On June 21, 1859, Cairook and one other captive were killed by soldiers while attempting to escape their incarceration. Most of the other Mohave captives escaped.

In July 1861, the commander of Fort Mohave, Major <a href="Lewis%20Armistead">Lewis Armistead</a>, ordered soldiers to fire into a group of Mohave who he suspected of having attacked a mail carrier and slaughtered his mule. The Mohave did not respond violently to the attack, but Armistead decided to punish them for harassing the mail party. He arrived at Irataba's ranch where a group of Mohave boys were planting beans, and from a hidden position he shot one of the planters, killing him. This attack prompted an assault on Armistead's detachment, who from an advantageous position on the high ground were able to repel the Mohave, killing many of them in a battle that lasted most of the day. Armistead's report of the assault of Irataba's ranch reported 23 dead Mohave warriors, but the Mohave remember a much higher number of casualties, including women and children killed by the soldiers. Sherer speculated that, given that 50 soldiers fired around 10 shots each, the casualty count could have been much higher than reported. The attack on Irataba's ranch is remembered by the Mohave as "the first and last battle with the Federal Troops."

After Cairook's death, whites living near the Colorado River began to view Irataba as the main leader of the Mohave. He had become "Aha macave yaltanack" (leader of the Mohave Nation) or "hochoch" (leader elected by the people); ""yaltanack"" is Mohave for "leader", and ""hochach"" means "head of a group". Homoseh quahote was a hereditary leader of the "Malika" clan ("the understanding people"), and the position of head of the Mohave was traditionally inherited only by someone from that clan. Because Irataba was of the "Huttoh pah", in order for him to become the leader of the Mohave Nation, Homoseh quahote had to step down so Irataba, as an elected leader, could take his place.

Despite the accepted English translations, the words "yaltanack" and "huchach" do not mean a "ruler" or "boss". Devereux describes Mohave government as "one of the least understood segments of Mohave culture", and notes that while white officials "tended to act on the assumption that Indian chiefs exercised absolute authority", as an elected leader Irataba was "primarily a servant of the tribe".

By the mid-1860s a deep rift had developed between Irataba, who was proactive in cooperating with white settlers, and Homoseh quahote, who passively tolerated but did not approve of white encroachment on Mohave lands. Irataba was "Aha macave yaltanack" of the Mohave from 1861 to 1866, but from 1867 to 1869 opinions differ, and by 1870 US government correspondence suggests that Homoseh quahote had succeeded him as leader of the Fort Mohave group.

Probably first to bring national attention to the potential gold in the region was F. X. Aubry, who in 1853 reported finding gold at a crossing of the Colorado and that he traded for legendary gold bullets further east with Tonto Apache. Newspapers across the country copied the gold strike story. Over the next decade mining discoveries up and down the lower Colorado River valley brought miners into newly formed mining districts. In the spring of 1861, Mohave, possibly including Irataba, aided a group of prospectors discover gold in Eldorado Canyon north east of Ft. Mohave, site of first mining rush to the immediate area. This was followed by the discovery of the San Francisco district (now Oatman district), where Irataba led John Moss to the rich Moss lode. Earlier, concern for protecting incoming miners brought together tribal leaders to Ft. Yuma in April 1863, including Irataba, where they pledged to allow prospectors into their country. On his return home, the Mohave joined a prospecting party led by mountain man <a href="Joseph%20R.%20Walker">Joseph R. Walker</a> who had prospected among them on the river in 1860. In 1863, Irataba acted as a guide for the <a href="Walker%20Party">Walker Party</a>, gold prospectors led by Walker and including <a href="Jack%20Swilling">Jack Swilling</a>, who later founded <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>. Irataba brought them to a river that he called "Hasyamp", later named the <a href="Hassayampa%20River">Hassayampa River</a>, where they found plentiful gold. Central Arizona's first mining district was established there the following year, which led to the founding of <a href="Prescott%2C%20Arizona">Prescott, Arizona</a> soon afterward. Relations between settlers and the Mohave were positive during this period, but as emigration increased, gold seekers founded towns, largest on the river being named <a href="La%20Paz%2C%20Arizona">La Paz</a>, stirring fear among settlers of a native uprising against further encroachment on Mohave land. The following year a group of soldiers from Fort Mohave discovered an area between Needles, Fort Mohave, and the Colorado River that was abundant in copper ore. The parcel was named Irataba Mining District, and within the year a mining company had been formed to work it. A small mining town named Irataba City was established on a bluff two miles below Fort Mohave. High copper market prices during the Civil War brought into operation the Bill Williams Fork copper mines as well, which shipped copper ore from the new Colorado River landing of Aubry. Though there would be down turns, mining in the Mohave lands was now well established.

As related above, during the early 1860s, Irataba befriended prospectors as a guide. One of them was John Moss, whom Irataba had shown the location of a gold mine in the Mojave desert, which Moss later sold. Moss suggested Irataba be invited to Washington so that he could see firsthand the United States' military might. In November 1863, Irataba traveled with Moss to <a href="San%20Pedro%2C%20Los%20Angeles">San Pedro, Los Angeles</a>, where they boarded the steamship "Senator", bound for San Francisco. In San Francisco, he stayed at the <a href="Occidental%20Hotel">Occidental Hotel</a> and created a storm as he walked down <a href="Jackson%20Street%20%28San%20Francisco%29">Jackson Street</a>, dressed in clothing typical of European Americans, which Irataba soon preferred to traditional Mohave clothing. The press documented his every movement and wrote extensively about his physical size and strong features. On December 2, 1863, the "Daily Evening Bulletin" described Irataba as a large man, "granitic in appearance as one of the Lower Coast mountains, with ... a lower jaw massive enough to crush nuts or crush quartz."

In January 1864 they sailed for the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Panama">Isthmus of Panama</a> on board the "Orizaba", then traveled onwards to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. Upon Irataba's arrival in New York, "<a href="Harper%27s%20Weekly">Harper's Weekly</a>" described him as "the finest specimen of unadulterated aboriginal on this continent". Here Irataba exchanged his suit and sombrero for the uniform and regalia of a <a href="major%20general">major general</a>, including a bright yellow sash, a gold badge encrusted with precious stones, and a medal with the inscription, "Irataba, Chief of the Mohaves, Arizona Territory". In February, when "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" asked him to explain the nature of his visit, he replied: "to see where so many pale faces come from". In New York he met with the former Mohave captive <a href="Olive%20Oatman">Olive Oatman</a>, and the two conversed in Mohave. Irataba told Oatman that her Mohave adoptive sister Topeka, to whom she had grown very close, still missed her and hoped she would return. Oatman described the encounter as a meeting between friends.

Irataba moved on to Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., where he earned great acclaim; government officials and military officers lavished him with gifts of medals, swords, and photographs. In Washington he met with President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, who gave him a silver-headed cane. He was the first Native American from the Southwest to meet an American president. The tour ended in April, when he and Moss sailed to California, again by way of Panama, and made their way back to Beale's Crossing from Los Angeles by wagon.

Upon Irataba's return from Washington D.C., he met with the Mohave while dressed in his major general's uniform, with medals. He wore a European-style hat and carried a long Japanese sword, and he told the Mohave about all the things he had seen. He tried to convince them that peace with the United States was in their best interests, and that war against them was futile, stressing their dominant military capabilities. Many Mohave were skeptical of his reports, and reacted with disbelief.

The completion of Fort Mohave began the process of military subjugation of the Mohave, and the next step was the establishment of <a href="Indian%20reservation">reservations</a>. In 1863, <a href="Charles%20Debrille%20Poston">Charles Debrille Poston</a>, the first Superintendent of Indian Affairs of the <a href="Arizona%20Territory">Arizona Territory</a>, called a conference between the Chemehuevi and Irataba's faction of the Mohave, in which he convinced them to form an alliance with the US against the Apache. The treaty was never ratified by the US Congress but formed an important step in establishing friendly relations between the Mohave and the US government following the military campaigns and the establishment of Fort Mohave.

Poston promoted the idea of establishing a reservation in the southern portion of Mohave country. Many Mohave opposed the proposed location and instead argued for a smaller parcel further north in the Mohave Valley, which had more fertile land. With Irataba and an engineer, Poston traveled down the Colorado River to survey a location. In August 1864 the post commander at Fort Mohave, Captain Charles Atchisson, stated that Irataba was against the proposed location. In September 1864, Poston gave the impression that Irataba was in favor of it. In a letter to General Richard C. Drum, Atchisson reported that Irataba and four Mohave leaders were unhappy with how Poston was handling the situation:

Faced with Irataba's disagreement, Poston promised that the US government would assist the Mohave with installing an irrigation system at the Colorado that would make most of the reservation arable. This apparently convinced Irataba, who traveled to the Colorado River Valley with about 800 people, almost a fifth of the entire Mohave Nation. General <a href="James%20Henry%20Carleton">James Henry Carleton</a> thought a reservation was unnecessary, and engineer <a href="Herman%20Ehrenberg">Herman Ehrenberg</a> disagreed with Poston's proposed location on the basis that the soil was too alkaline for farming, the need for irrigation too great, and the task of raising the river too insurmountable. Nonetheless, on March 3, 1865, Congress established the <a href="Colorado%20River%20Indian%20Reservation">Colorado River Indian Reservation</a> at Poston's proposed location. Ehrenberg's concerns proved valid, and neither Poston nor any subsequent US authority was willing to dedicate the considerable resources required to make the location suitable for farming. The reservation was established without a treaty having been established between the Mohave and the US government. The boundaries were expanded and clarified by <a href="executive%20order">executive order</a>s issued by <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">President Grant</a> in 1873, 1874 and 1867.

Most of the Mohave refused to leave their ancestral homelands for the reservation, but Irataba's conviction that the reservation was their best option marked the beginning of a rift between his group and those who stayed behind to follow Homoseh quahote, the nation's hereditary leader. According to an eyewitness account by Chooksa homar, Irataba explained his decision to move:

As the promised irrigation assistance was not immediately forthcoming, the first year at the reservation brought a drought that made it necessary for the Mohave to request food assistance. In 1867, Irataba and the Mohave began to build an irrigation canal, digging by hand a ditch that ran for . A report by a US official visiting the reservation in 1870 recorded that attempts by the Mohave at agricultural cultivation on the site were restricted to an area of not more than .

Irataba continued to lead the Colorado River band of Mohave during the 1860s. He pursued peaceful relations with the surrounding tribes and cooperated actively with US authorities. He also helped the Yavapai and Walapai in ongoing conflicts with Paiutes and Chemehuevi.

In March 1865, Irataba and the Mohave defeated the Chemehuevi after their allies, the Paiutes, killed two Mohave women. The Mohave pushed the Chemehuevi off their traditional territory and into the California desert, but they soon returned. To avoid fighting a two-front war, Irataba attacked the Chemehuevi first, then turned his attention to the Paiutes, who were planning an attack on the Mohave farm and granary on the Colorado's Cottonwood Island. During a subsequent battle with the Chemehuevi in October 1865, Irataba was taken prisoner while wearing his major general's uniform. According to a contemporary news report based on second hand accounts from white travelers, the captors feared that killing him would invite repercussions from the soldiers stationed at Fort Mohave, so they instead stripped him naked and sent him home badly beaten. In the Mohave account of the events as told by Chooksa homar, Irataba surrendered in an effort to make peace with the Chemehuevi, and offered his uniform to their chief as a gesture of peace. In 1867, a treaty signed by Irataba and the Chemehuevi leader Pan Coyer restored peaceful relations between the two nations.

Irataba also welcomed bands of Yavapai onto the reservation after they had been subject to massacres by US troops, or suffered starvation due to having been driven from their lands. The meager resources of the reservation proved unable to sustain the additional population and eventually the Yavapai had to leave. Irataba frequently served as a mediator between Yavapai and Walapai who had become embroiled in conflicts with the US army, and participated in peace parlays. In 1871–72, General <a href="George%20Crook">George Crook</a> came to the Mohave reservation looking for a group of Yavapai thought to be responsible for the <a href="Wickenburg%20Massacre">Wickenburg Massacre</a>, and Irataba had no choice but to turn the war party over to the army. He traveled to the trial proceedings at <a href="Fort%20Date%20Creek">Fort Date Creek</a>, where he was instructed to hand tobacco to the Yavapai he believed to be responsible, as a way for him to testify against them without their realizing it. As soldiers attempted to arrest the men that Irataba identified, fighting broke out and one of the Yavapai leaders, <a href="Ohatchecama">Ohatchecama</a>, and his brother were shot. Despite having been shot twice and stabbed with a bayonet, Ohatchecama survived and escaped to organize the Tolkepaya Yavapai in resistance against the US army. The Yavapai felt betrayed by Irataba, and plotted to kill him in revenge, but were eventually persuaded that he was not the one who had turned them over to Crook.

The Colorado River band of Mohave never replaced Irataba; he was their leader when he died at their reservation on May 3 or 4, 1874. His cause of death is unknown, but <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> and natural causes are both cited. The Mohave grieved deeply; Irataba's cremation and the rituals of mourning were reported in newspapers as far away as Omaha, Nebraska. Irataba was succeeded as leader on the Colorado Reservation by his nephew, Qolho qorau of the "Vemacka" clan, who upheld his uncle's policies.

In 1966, Sherer commented regarding Irataba's legacy amongst the Mohave: "Estimation of his position in Mojave history from the Mojave viewpoint differs. To some he is an heroic figure, to others he was a white collaborator who did not stand up for Mojave rights. From the standpoint of white men who were conquering a wilderness, he was indeed the Mojave who worked unswervingly for peace."

Irataba's influence as a leader may even have left its mark on the <a href="Mohave%20language">Mohave language</a>. A list of Mohave words that he dictated to an anthropologist during his visit in Washington shows that he was among the first Mohave speakers to shift the sounds [s] and (similar to sh as in "shack") to (th as in "thick") and [s], respectively. By the late 19th century all Mohave speakers had adopted this change. Linguist Leanne Hinton has suggested that this may be due in part to Irataba's influence, both because he was a prestigious leader whose ways of speaking may have been emulated by other Mohave, and also because when he led the Mohave onto the reservation the old distinctions between dialect groups were erased through <a href="dialect%20leveling">dialect leveling</a>, making new changes spread quickly through the community.

The Irataba Society, a non-profit charity run by the <a href="Colorado%20River%20Indian%20Tribes">Colorado River Indian Tribes</a>, was established in <a href="Parker%2C%20Arizona">Parker, Arizona</a>, in 1970. The charity holds an annual <a href="pow%20wow">pow wow</a> or National Indian Days celebration. Irataba Hall, a sports venue in Parker, is also named after him. In 2002, the US <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a> designated of the <a href="Eldorado%20Mountains">Eldorado Mountains</a>, contained largely within the <a href="Lake%20Mead%20National%20Recreation%20Area">Lake Mead National Recreation Area</a>, as Ireteba Peaks Wilderness.

In March 2015, the Colorado River Indian Tribes celebrated the sesquicentennial history of their reservation with a weekend-long event that included cultural activities and a parade. Speakers at the event stressed the important role that Irataba's strong leadership played in establishing and preserving the reservation, and the continuing need for Native leaders to protect native language and culture. Tribal chairman Dennis Patch commented: "Some people would think we're lucky, as we have this river and 220,000 acre feet of water ... But we have had great leaders, like Chief Irataba. He made sure the Mohaves stayed on land they had lived on since time immemorial." Former CRIT Museum Director Dr. Michael Tsosie stated, "Irataba understood the Mohave people would need to keep fighting to keep what they had." He noted that the Colorado River Indian Reservation "is unique in American history in that they have not lost any land".

2006 Subway 500

The 2006 Subway 500 was the 32nd <a href="Stock%20car%20racing">stock car race</a> of the <a href="2006%20NASCAR%20Nextel%20Cup%20Series">2006 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series</a> and the sixth in the ten-race season-ending <a href="Chase%20for%20the%20Sprint%20Cup">Chase for the Nextel Cup</a>. It was held on October 22, 2006, before a crowd of 65,000, at <a href="Martinsville%20Speedway">Martinsville Speedway</a> in <a href="Martinsville%2C%20Virginia">Martinsville, Virginia</a>, one of five <a href="Short%20track%20motor%20racing">short tracks</a> to hold <a href="NASCAR">NASCAR</a> races. The 500-lap race was won by <a href="Jimmie%20Johnson">Jimmie Johnson</a> of the <a href="Hendrick%20Motorsports">Hendrick Motorsports</a> team, after he started from ninth position; <a href="Denny%20Hamlin">Denny Hamlin</a> finished second, and <a href="Bobby%20Labonte">Bobby Labonte</a> came in third.

Although <a href="Kurt%20Busch">Kurt Busch</a> won the <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a>, he was immediately passed by <a href="Jeff%20Gordon">Jeff Gordon</a> at the start of the race. 143 laps later Johnson took the lead for one lap. Gordon regained the lead on the next lap, only to lose it to Johnson again on the 153rd lap. Labonte moved into the lead on lap 406 and held it with 55 laps remaining, when he was passed by Johnson. At the race's final restart on lap 495 Hamlin challenged Johnson for the lead, but the latter held off Hamlin's passing maneuver and won the race. There were 18 <a href="Racing%20flags%23Yellow%20flag">cautions</a> and 16 lead changes by five different drivers during the race.

It was Johnson's fifth win of the 2006 season, and the 23rd of his career. The result advanced him to third in the <a href="List%20of%20NASCAR%20Sprint%20Cup%20Series%20champions">Drivers' Championship</a>, 41 points behind <a href="Matt%20Kenseth">Matt Kenseth</a> (who took over the championship lead when <a href="Jeff%20Burton">Jeff Burton</a> retired during the race; this caused Burton to fall to fifth in the championship, one point behind Hamlin). <a href="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a> maintained its lead in the <a href="NASCAR%20Manufacturers%27%20Championship">Manufacturers' Championship</a>, 53 points ahead of <a href="Dodge">Dodge</a> and 61 ahead of <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> with four races left in the season.

The Subway 500 was the 32nd of 36 scheduled <a href="Stock%20car%20racing">stock car race</a>s of the <a href="2006%20NASCAR%20Nextel%20Cup%20Series">2006 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series</a> and the sixth in the ten-race season-ending <a href="Chase%20for%20the%20Sprint%20Cup">Chase for the Nextel Cup</a>. It was held on October 22, 2006 at <a href="Martinsville%20Speedway">Martinsville Speedway</a> in <a href="Martinsville%2C%20Virginia">Martinsville, Virginia</a>, one of five <a href="Short%20track%20motor%20racing">short tracks</a> to hold <a href="NASCAR">NASCAR</a> races; the others are <a href="Richmond%20International%20Raceway">Richmond International Raceway</a>, <a href="Dover%20International%20Speedway">Dover International Speedway</a>, <a href="Bristol%20Motor%20Speedway">Bristol Motor Speedway</a> and <a href="Phoenix%20International%20Raceway">Phoenix International Raceway</a>. The standard track at Martinsville Speedway is a four-turn, <a href="Oval%20track%20racing">oval</a>. Its turns are <a href="Banked%20turn">banked</a> at eleven <a href="Degree%20%28angle%29">degrees</a>, and neither the <a href="Straight%20%28racing%29">front stretch</a> (the location of the finish line) nor the back stretch is banked.

Before the race <a href="Jeff%20Burton">Jeff Burton</a> led the <a href="List%20of%20NASCAR%20Sprint%20Cup%20Series%20champions">Drivers' Championship</a> with 5,763 <a href="List%20of%20NASCAR%20points%20scoring%20systems%231975%E2%80%932010">points</a>, with <a href="Matt%20Kenseth">Matt Kenseth</a> second and <a href="Kevin%20Harvick">Kevin Harvick</a> third. <a href="Mark%20Martin">Mark Martin</a> and <a href="Dale%20Earnhardt%20Jr.">Dale Earnhardt Jr.</a> were fourth and fifth, and <a href="Denny%20Hamlin">Denny Hamlin</a>, <a href="Jimmie%20Johnson">Jimmie Johnson</a>, <a href="Kasey%20Kahne">Kasey Kahne</a>, <a href="Kyle%20Busch">Kyle Busch</a> and <a href="Jeff%20Gordon">Jeff Gordon</a> rounded out the top ten drivers competing for the 2006 <a href="Chase%20for%20the%20Sprint%20Cup">Chase for the Nextel Cup</a>. In the <a href="List%20of%20NASCAR%20Manufacturers%27%20champions">Manufacturers' Championship</a>, <a href="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a> led with 237 points; <a href="Dodge">Dodge</a> was second with 179, followed by <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> with 173. Gordon was the race's defending champion.

After falling from seventh to tenth in the Drivers' Championship at the previous race (at <a href="Charlotte%20Motor%20Speedway">Charlotte Motor Speedway</a>), Gordon said he would try and win races to return to contention for the championship. Jeff Burton called the Subway 500 "another volatile race in the Chase", and thought it would significantly impact the chase contenders. Although Kenseth felt that the race would be the toughest for his team, he believed that a good finish would put him in a better position for the championship because of his good results at the tracks following the Martinsville race. After a good finish at Charlotte, Earnhardt felt he was in "good shape": "Jeff has been at this a long time, but I don't look at him as indestructible. If he has a mistake or even a couple of bad runs, it will completely shake up the points." After winning the <a href="2006%20NASCAR%20Busch%20Series">Busch Series</a> championship, Harvick focused on the Nextel Cup championship: "We're excited about it, proud of what we've done this year, and, hopefully, we can do what we need to do on the Cup side in the next five weeks. I have never had a season like this." Hamlin thought he would perform well at Martinsville, where he felt comfortable, and he and his team did not rule themselves out of contention for the title.

In preparation for the race, NASCAR held the last of its test days for Nextel Cup entrants on October 16–18 at <a href="Homestead-Miami%20Speedway">Homestead-Miami Speedway</a>. Sessions began at 1:00 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern Daylight Time</a> (EDT), paused from 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. and concluded at 9:00 p.m. Fifty-eight cars, a mix of <a href="Car%20of%20Tomorrow">Cars of Tomorrow</a> and 2006 cars, participated in the October 16 afternoon session. <a href="Reed%20Sorenson">Reed Sorenson</a> was quickest with a speed of , and <a href="Casey%20Mears">Casey Mears</a> had the highest speed of in the evening session. During the third session (with 75 cars), Kyle Busch had the fastest speed of ; Gordon had the highest speed of the three days, at in the fourth session. During the fifth session, on the afternoon of October 18, 23 cars were tested. <a href="Scott%20Wimmer">Scott Wimmer</a> had the highest speed of , and <a href="Jeff%20Green%20%28racing%20driver%29">Jeff Green</a> had the highest speed of in the evening session.

One team substituted for its regular driver. <a href="Morgan-McClure%20Motorsports">Morgan-McClure Motorsports</a> driver <a href="Todd%20Bodine">Todd Bodine</a> decided to concentrate on the <a href="2006%20NASCAR%20Craftsman%20Truck%20Series">Craftsman Truck Series</a> title, and was replaced by <a href="Ward%20Burton">Ward Burton</a>, the <a href="2002%20Daytona%20500">2002 Daytona 500</a> champion. Burton, who had not raced since <a href="2004%20NASCAR%20Nextel%20Cup%20Series">2004</a>, went to <a href="Motor%20Mile%20Speedway">Motor Mile Speedway</a> to reacquaint himself with NASCAR. According to crew chief <a href="Chris%20Carrier">Chris Carrier</a>, Burton expressed a large amount of interest in driving at Martinsville: "He's a Virginia driver and we're a Virginia team. That makes for a great combination at Martinsville." On October 18, <a href="Roush%20Fenway%20Racing">Roush Racing</a> announced that Craftsman Truck Series driver <a href="David%20Ragan">David Ragan</a> would drive the 06 car in four of the season's five remaining races beginning with the Subway 500. Ragan said that the experience would help him prepare for his full-time début in <a href="2007%20NASCAR%20Nextel%20Cup%20Series">2007</a>.

Three practice sessions were held before the Sunday race: one on Friday and two on Saturday. The first session lasted 90 minutes, the second 60 minutes and the third 45 minutes. In the first practice session, Gordon was fastest with a time of 19.478 seconds; <a href="Ryan%20Newman%20%28racing%20driver%29">Ryan Newman</a> was second and Hamlin third. Johnson took fourth position, and <a href="Dave%20Blaney">Dave Blaney</a> placed fifth. <a href="Kurt%20Busch">Kurt Busch</a>, <a href="Sterling%20Marlin">Sterling Marlin</a>, Green, Sorenson and Kahne rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Martin switched to a back-up car after he crashed.

Although fifty cars were entered in the qualifier, according to NASCAR's <a href="Go%20or%20Go%20Home">qualifying procedure</a> only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Kurt Busch clinched his sixth <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a> of the season, the ninth of his career and his first at Martinsville, with a time of 19.408. He was joined on the grid's front row by Gordon, who was 0.038 seconds slower and had the pole position until Kurt Busch's lap. Hamlin qualified third, Newman fourth and <a href="Tony%20Stewart">Tony Stewart</a> fifth. Blaney was sixth, with Earnhardt and Green seventh and eighth. Johnson, a Chase for the Nextel Cup driver, qualified ninth and <a href="Ken%20Schrader">Ken Schrader</a> rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Harvick, another driver in the Chase, set the twelfth-fastest time. The seven drivers who failed to qualify were <a href="Mike%20Bliss">Mike Bliss</a>, <a href="Hermie%20Sadler">Hermie Sadler</a>, <a href="Chad%20Chaffin">Chad Chaffin</a>, <a href="Morgan%20Shepherd">Morgan Shepherd</a>, <a href="Ted%20Christopher">Ted Christopher</a>, <a href="Derrike%20Cope">Derrike Cope</a> and <a href="Stanton%20Barrett">Stanton Barrett</a>. After the qualifier Kurt Busch said, "It was a great lap, unexpected for me, but this team has always qualified well at this track, Martinsville is the kind of track that you either love or hate, and I've learned to do both. It's a tough, challenging short track."

On Saturday morning Marlin was fastest in the second practice session with a time of 19.668 seconds, ahead of Kahne and Gordon. <a href="Dale%20Jarrett">Dale Jarrett</a> was fourth-fastest; Mears was fifth and Johnson sixth. Hamlin, <a href="Brian%20Vickers">Brian Vickers</a>, <a href="Greg%20Biffle">Greg Biffle</a> and Jeff Burton followed in the top ten. Of the other drivers in the Chase, Kyle Busch was 13th-fastest and Martin set the 19th-fastest time. During the second practice session, <a href="Scott%20Riggs">Scott Riggs</a> (who had the forty-third quickest time) had an engine failure in the session's opening minutes and changed engines. Later that day, Johnson paced the final practice session with a time of 19.722; Harvick was second and Biffle third. Marlin was fourth-fastest, ahead of <a href="David%20Stremme">David Stremme</a> and Hamlin. Earnhardt was seventh-fastest, Kyle Busch eighth, Gordon ninth and Mears tenth. Other Chase drivers included Jeff Burton in 17th and Kahne in 17th; all were within one-tenth of a second of Johnson's time. The session was suspended when <a href="Kenny%20Wallace">Kenny Wallace</a>'s engine blew up, since the track then needed to be checked and cleaned, and Wallace changed engines. Jarrett spun out with a brake problem, but since he made only minor contact with the wall he did not have to switch to a back-up car. After a similar collision, <a href="Michael%20Waltrip">Michael Waltrip</a> also did not have to switch cars.

Live television coverage of the race began at 12:32 p.m. EDT in the United States on <a href="NBC">NBC</a>. Rain showers were forecast for the day of the race, and at the start weather conditions were overcast and some rain had already fallen. The air temperature was around . Cleaning trucks cleared the track before the start. Eldrid Davis of Raceway Ministries began pre-race ceremonies with an <a href="invocation">invocation</a>, the <a href="Martinsville%20High%20School%20%28Virginia%29">Martinsville High School</a> marching band performed the <a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">national anthem</a> and <a href="Subway%20%28restaurant%29">Subway</a> spokesperson <a href="Jared%20Fogle">Jared Fogle</a> commanded the drivers to start their engines. During the <a href="Parade%20lap">pace laps</a>, Riggs and Wallace moved to the rear of the grid because they had changed their engines.

The race began at 1:00 p.m. Gordon accelerated faster than Kurt Busch off the line, and was ahead of him by the second turn. The first <a href="Racing%20flags%23Yellow%20flag">caution</a> was given two laps later when <a href="Martin%20Truex%2C%20Jr.">Martin Truex Jr.</a> spun sideways in turn four and Marlin, Sorenson and <a href="Kyle%20Petty">Kyle Petty</a> sustained damage to their cars. Jeff Burton had front-end damage to his vehicle when he contacted the rear of <a href="Joe%20Nemechek">Joe Nemechek</a>'s car. At the lap ten <a href="Rolling%20start">restart</a>, Gordon maintained his lead over Kurt Busch and Denny Hamlin. Seven laps later, Hamlin passed Kurt Busch for second place. Earnhardt passed Kurt Busch for fourth place on the 44th lap. On lap 45, he reported that one of his engine's cylinders was misfiring and was worse coming out of the turns. Five laps later Gordon had a 1.8-second lead over Hamlin, which grew to 2.4 seconds on lap 60; Earnhardt had moved into second by that lap. On lap 64, a collision between Mears and Newman in turn four prompted the second caution; although Mears was spun around, he was able to continue. During the caution, all the leaders made <a href="pit%20stop">pit stop</a>s for fuel and tires. Jeff Burton's pit crew repaired his loose <a href="Hood%20%28vehicle%29">hood</a> with tape on the right front. Biffle left the track on lap 67 with brake problems. Newman was sent to the rear of the longest line by NASCAR two laps later for his role in the incident with Mears, and Gordon maintained the top position at the lap-71 restart.

Eight laps later Earnhardt passed Raines for second position, and Gordon had a 1.7-second advantage over Earnhardt by lap 80. Raines was passed by Stewart for third on lap 83, and Johnson took third place from Stewart six laps later. <a href="J.J.%20Yeley">J.J. Yeley</a> drove to pit road on the 94th lap with a <a href="Flat%20tire">flat left-rear tire</a>. On lap 106, Burton (whose car was hot because of the tape on his hood) made contact with Gordon and escaped with minor damage after a three-lap battle. Twenty-four laps later Johnson passed Earnhardt for second place, and on lap 144 he passed Gordon for the lead. One lap later Gordon reclaimed first place, and built a quarter-second lead by lap 150. Johnson moved back into the lead on lap 153. Two laps later Stremme spun sideways, prompting the third caution, and all the leaders made pit stops. Johnson remained the leader at the lap-161 restart, ahead of Gordon and Stewart. After the caution ended, Burton switched to a second ignition after feeling he had a problem with his engine. Forty-two laps later Waltrip's turn-four spin prompted the fourth caution, although he was able to continue. During the caution, the leaders again made pit stops. Johnson, who had minor air-pressure adjustments because of sunlight exposure at his pit stop, maintained his lead at the restart.

Jeff Burton drove to his garage on lap 218 when a <a href="carburetor">carburetor</a> problem caused him to run slower than his rivals; Earnhardt and Stewart avoided a wreck on that lap. Four laps later, the fifth caution came out when <a href="David%20Gilliland">David Gilliland</a> made contact with Ward Burton in turn two; although Burton spun, he avoided hitting the wall. Johnson maintained his lead at the lap-227 restart. The sixth caution was given on lap 231 when Sorenson spun after colliding with Riggs, causing <a href="Mike%20Skinner%20%28racing%20driver%29">Mike Skinner</a> to contact the left front quarter of Harvick's car and <a href="Travis%20Kvapil">Travis Kvapil</a> to spin sideways. Biffle sustained damage to his car's nose, and turn three was temporarily blocked. Harvick, Kahne, Vickers and Biffle went to pit road for repairs, while the leaders remained on the track. Johnson led on the lap-238 restart. Four laps later Kvapil made heavy contact with the wall after being bumped and <a href="Tony%20Raines">Tony Raines</a>' car had a cut tire from contact with Ragan, prompting the seventh caution. Most of the leaders, including Johnson, again made pit stops. On lap 244, it was announced that Jeff Burton had retired from the race. Gordon became the leader at the restart, ahead of Hamlin, <a href="Elliott%20Sadler">Elliott Sadler</a>, Kurt Busch and Nemechek.

Hamlin passed Gordon for the lead on lap 256. Twenty-three laps later Bowyer made contact with Kenseth, spinning him in turn four (although he kept his car off the wall) and prompting the race's eighth caution. During the caution, most of the leaders (including Hamlin) made pit stops. Kyle and Kurt Busch's pit crews made <a href="Panhard%20rod">track-bar</a> adjustments to their cars. Hamlin had tape added to the front of his car to fix a handling problem, and Sadler narrowly avoided a collision with Kahne. Johnson regained the lead after the pit stops, maintaining it at the lap-286 restart. Fourteen laps later Kurt Busch passed Earnhardt for second place, and Gordon moved back up to fifth by lap 318. On lap 331, the ninth caution was given; Schrader collided with the wall, made contact with Ragan going into turn two and both drivers hit Jarrett. Schrader retired from the race because of the collision, but Ragan and Jarrett continued. The leaders, including Johnson, made pit stops during the caution. Kurt Busch gained the lead after the pit stops, maintaining it at the lap-341 restart. Six laps later Raines made contact with Skinner, forcing him to collide with the inside wall and prompting the tenth caution. With severe damage to his car's rear end quarter, Skinner stopped before the start-finish line. Kurt Busch maintained his lead at the lap-353 restart, ahead of Johnson and Earnhardt.

Johnson moved into the lead on the same lap after passing Kurt Busch, who dropped two more places on the lap. Two laps later Ragan spun after contact with Elliott Sadler, prompting the eleventh caution; none of the leaders made pit stops. Johnson led at the lap-361 restart, ahead of Earnhardt and Hamlin. The twelfth caution came out two laps later when Kurt Busch tried to pass Riggs and the drivers made contact coming off turn four. Kurt Busch was spun while crossing the start-finish line and hit the inside wall, requiring a pit stop for repairs. Johnson maintained his lead at the lap-371 restart and was followed by Earnhardt, Hamlin, Kurt Busch and Gordon (who made a pit stop for an air-pressure adjustment during the caution). Hamlin passed Earnhardt for second place ten laps later. The thirteenth caution was prompted on lap 399 when <a href="Bobby%20Labonte">Bobby Labonte</a> made contact with <a href="Jamie%20McMurray">Jamie McMurray</a> in turn two, sending him spinning sideways but avoiding the wall. Most of the leaders, including Johnson, made pit stops. Johnson adjusted his air pressure, and Hamlin's pit crew removed a front <a href="Fender%20%28vehicle%29">fender</a>.
Labonte led on the lap-406 restart, followed by Mears and Gordon. Elliott Sadler went to his garage with motor problems on lap 411. By lap 437, Johnson had moved into second position. Seven laps later he passed Labonte for the lead, and Hamlin passed Gordon for fourth a lap later. Lap 447 saw the fourteenth caution; Ragan spun sideways at turn four and Kyle Busch collided with the wall to avoid him, sustaining minor damage to his car's right side. One lap later, Kyle Busch went to pit road for repairs. The race restarted on lap 453, with Johnson leading Labonte and Hamlin. On the 460th lap Gilliand caused Mears to spin sideways coming out of turn four, prompting the fifteenth caution; Johnson maintained his lead at the restart. On lap 468, Bowyer triggered the sixteenth caution after spinning sideways at turn three. Four laps later, Martin drove to pit road for engine troubleshooting.

The race restarted on lap 476, when a seventeenth caution was issued because Earnhardt made contact with Kahne after trying to pass him; Earnhardt spun at turn three. Martin again went to pit road because of water problems, and Johnson maintained the lead at the restart. On lap 484, Hamlin passed Labonte for second place. Five laps later Wallace spun coming out of turn two after being hit by McMurray, prompting the race's eighteenth (and final) caution, but was able to continue. Johnson remained the leader at the lap-495 restart, with Hamlin close behind. Hamlin bumped Johnson coming out of turn two, causing Johnson to move to the outside lane, and went to the inside lane to draw alongside him on the back stretch. They remained side by side for one lap, when Johnson drew ahead of Hamlin at turn four. He pulled away, holding the lead for the remaining six laps to win the race. Hamlin finished second, ahead of Labonte in third, Stewart in fourth and Gordon in fifth. Mears, Kahne, Green, Harvick and Petty rounded out the top ten finishers. The race had a total of 18 cautions and 16 lead changes by five drivers. Johnson led seven times for a total of 245 laps, more than any other competitor. The win was the 23rd of Johnson's Cup Career, as well as his final of five victories he posted in the 2006 season.

Johnson appeared in <a href="Glossary%20of%20motorsport%20terms%23V">Victory Lane</a> after his <a href="victory%20lap">victory lap</a> to celebrate his fifth win of the season in front of the crowd; the win earned him $191,886. He was pleased with the result, saying he was happy to have taken the victory: "We've been running up front the last three of four races and haven't been able to close the deal. Today we did." Hamlin was disappointed with his finish as he felt he had a faster car after the race's final restart but admitted Johnson would not be beaten: "It was my only shot to get around him. I wasn't going to get under him completely. There was no way possible. I was doing the best I could to win the race." He later admitted that he made contact with Johnson and that it was on purpose. Labonte said about his third-place finish, "I feel like I stole something." Jeff Burton was philosophical about his retirement from the race: "These things happen. Everybody has had an issue in this Chase, and we had ours today. This thing is not over for us by any means." Kenseth, who finished eleventh, was optimistic about his chances of winning the Drivers' Championship: "It's great to be the leader, but we've got to start running good, It's still pretty wide open. It's going to be pretty exciting, I think, coming down to the last race."

Earnhardt admitted that he was to blame for the collision with Kahne on lap 476. He said was anxious to pass him and was underneath him when he made the maneuver but his rear brakes locked which caused him to spin. Kahne thought Earnhardt was driving too hard in turn three: "I guess I need to get somebody on [the radio] to preach to me to have more patience because I definitely can't take control of myself." After retiring from the race, Schrader said of his collision with Ragan, "I moved him earlier because you can't run like that two laps down. Got back around him and he paid me back for moving him, but he was two laps down." Ragan denied intentionally wrecking Schrader, saying that he over-drove his car going into the first corner and his brakes locked. Stewart saw Ragan's lap-447 spin (which caused Kyle Busch to collide with the wall), and believed that NASCAR should have disqualified Ragan from the race.

According to Mears, who was involved in an incident with Newman on the 64th lap, "[Newman] was kind of holding everyone up. When I got up to him, he tried to park me in the center of the corner. [He] just got on the brakes and I got into the back of him. Got him a little loose. He didn't wreck, but he came around the next lap and wrecked me." Although Mears was also angry about the incident with Gilliland 396 laps later, he praised his car's handling and said it was the first time a car had worked in his favor. Three days after the race, NASCAR announced that <a href="Michael%20Waltrip%20Racing">Waltrip-Jasper Racing</a> crew chief <a href="Tommy%20Baldwin%20Jr.">Tommy Baldwin Jr.</a> was fined $5,000 for violating four NASCAR rules. The fines were for "actions detrimental to stock car racing", car, car parts, components and/or equipment used in the race that was not compliant to NASCAR rules and for entering the car-servicing area without a fire-resistant uniform or helmet.

The result left Kenseth leading the Drivers' Championship with 5,848 points, ahead of Harvick with 5,812. Johnson moved into third with 5,807, six points ahead of Hamlin. After the race, Jeff Burton (who fell to fifth) was still upbeat about his championship chances: "We have as good a shot as anybody. We've run well enough to win the championship; we just got to put the next four races together." Earnhardt, Martin, Kahne, Gordon and Kyle Busch rounded out the top ten. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet maintained the lead with 246 points. Dodge remained in second with 185, eight points ahead of Ford. The race took three hours and forty-four minutes to complete, and the margin of victory was 0.544 seconds.

Life's Shop Window

Life's Shop Window is a 1914 American <a href="silent%20film">silent</a> <a href="Drama%20%28film%20and%20television%29">drama film</a> directed by <a href="J.%20Gordon%20Edwards">J. Gordon Edwards</a> and starring <a href="Claire%20Whitney">Claire Whitney</a> and <a href="Stuart%20Holmes">Stuart Holmes</a>. It is a <a href="film%20adaptation">film adaptation</a> of the 1907 novel of the same name by <a href="Annie%20Sophie%20Cory">Annie Sophie Cory</a>. The film depicts the story of English orphan Lydia Wilton (Whitney), and her husband Bernard Chetwin (Holmes). Although Wilton's marriage is legitimate, it was conducted in secret, and she is accused of having a child out of wedlock. Forced to leave England, she reunites with her husband in Arizona. There, she is tempted by infidelity with an old acquaintance, Eustace Pelham, before seeing the error of her ways and returning to her family.

"Life's Shop Window" was the first film produced, rather than simply distributed, by <a href="William%20Fox%20%28producer%29">William Fox</a>'s <a href="Box%20Office%20Attractions%20Company">Box Office Attractions Company</a>, the corporate predecessor to <a href="Fox%20Film">Fox Film</a>. Several reviewers approved of the film's expurgated treatment of the novel's plot, although opinions of the quality of the film itself were mixed. It proved very popular upon its initial release in New York, and that success was used to advertise the film elsewhere. Like many of Fox's early works, it was likely <a href="lost%20film">lost</a> in the <a href="1937%20Fox%20vault%20fire">1937 Fox vault fire</a>.

Bernard Chetwin is a boarder at John Anderson's farm in England. He is unimpressed by Anderson's spoiled daughter Bella, but is attracted to their orphaned servant, Lydia Wilton. She tells him of her dreams for a happier life, and they fall in love. Wilton also meets Eustace Pelham, who introduces her to his philosophy of "life's shop window": that many people make life decisions on purely superficial grounds. Chetwin marries Wilton in a secret ceremony.

Intending to establish a farm to support his new family, Chetwin leaves the English countryside for Arizona. Concerned about the dangers of frontier territory, he travels without his newlywed wife, intending to send for her later. When she gives birth to Chetwin's child, Anderson's wife refuses to accept evidence of her marriage, and throws her out of the farm for having a child out of wedlock. She takes the infant with her to Arizona and reunites with Chetwin at his ranch.

The demands of managing the ranch consume all of Chetwin's time, leaving Wilton to feel neglected and unloved. One day, a traveler is injured near the ranch, whom she recognizes as Pelham. Pelham courts her, taking advantage of her loneliness. Although she admits she does not love him, he convinces her to abandon her family and run away with him. As she is preparing to depart, she is confronted by Starlight, an Indian woman who works as a servant on the ranch, who reminds Wilton of the needs of her child. She spurns Pelham and returns to her family. Eventually, Chetwin forgives her and devotes more of his time to her. Pelham may have been killed by Starlight, although his ultimate fate is left unclear.


<a href="Annie%20Sophie%20Cory">Annie Sophie Cory</a>, writing as Victoria Cross, was a popular but controversial British <a href="New%20Woman">New Woman</a> novelist. Adultery and female sexuality are common themes in her works, which often reversed the expected gender roles of the time, permitting female desire to motivate the plot. <a href="Elizabeth%20Bisland">Elizabeth Bisland</a> described Lydia, the main character of Cory's 1907 novel "Life's Shop Window", as "a very modernist heroine", comparing her to a more socially successful <a href="Hester%20Prynne">Hester Prynne</a>. Like many of Cross's novels, it attracted controversy, and was banned for a time by the Circulating Libraries Association in the United Kingdom. "Life's Shop Window" had already become the basis of a successful play, based on an <a href="expurgation">expurgated</a> version of the novel's plot.

In 1914, <a href="William%20Fox%20%28producer%29">William Fox</a> was operating the successful <a href="film%20distributor">film distributor</a> Box Office Attraction Film Rental Company. Box Office purchased films from studios such as <a href="Balboa%20Amusement%20Producing%20Company">Balboa Amusement Producing Company</a>, showing them in Fox's New York area theaters and renting prints to exhibitors elsewhere in the country. "Life's Shop Window" may have originally been considered for production in this manner. However, Fox decided he was unwilling to depend on others for the products his business required, and instead prepared to produce his own films under the <a href="Box%20Office%20Attractions%20Company">Box Office Attractions Company</a> name. He purchased the <a href="%C3%89clair%20%28company%29">Éclair</a> film studio in <a href="Fort%20Lee%2C%20New%20Jersey">Fort Lee, New Jersey</a> and property in <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a>, arranged for actors and crew, and began production with an <a href="film%20adaptation">adaptation</a> of an established work, as was common at the time.

Rights to the film adaptation were purchased for $100. Like the theatrical adaptation, Mary Asquith's screenplay removed much of the book's controversial sexual elements, censorship intended to make Fox's nascent studio appear more respectable to the industry. Fox selected <a href="J.%20Gordon%20Edwards">J. Gordon Edwards</a> to direct, in what may have been his directorial debut; credit for the earlier "<a href="St.%20Elmo%20%281914%20film%29">St. Elmo</a>" is disputed, with sources disagreeing whether Edwards or <a href="Bertram%20Bracken">Bertram Bracken</a> directed.

Filming for "Life's Shop Window" took place at a farm on the Staten Island property, and possibly in the Fort Lee studio. The budget for this five-reel feature film was small, with the cost of production reported as $4,500 or $6,000; Fox would exaggerate the cost of production to over thirty times its true value in later advertising. At the time, films of comparable length generally required between $20,000 and $30,000 to produce. Film historian <a href="Terry%20Ramsaye">Terry Ramsaye</a> reported that Fox was not pleased with the completed film and initially declared: "Let's burn the damn thing", before being convinced to allow its release. "Life's Shop Window" <a href="premiere">premiere</a>d at the <a href="Academy%20of%20Music%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Academy of Music</a> in New York on October 20, 1914, although it did not receive its official release until November 19.

Contemporary reviews were mixed. "<a href="Moving%20Picture%20World">Moving Picture World</a>" film critic W. Stephen Bush called the film "first-class" despite problems with the plot, cinematography, and the "unbelievably poor" music accompaniment at the Academy of Music. He also remarked on the censorship of the novel's plot, stating that "not even the sternest of moralists can find anything objectionable" in the film. Fox's response was published the following week, in which he praised Bush's review and committed to avoiding "the salacious or the sex drama". <a href="Peter%20Milne%20%28screenwriter%29">Peter Milne</a> of "<a href="Motion%20Picture%20News">Motion Picture News</a>" also praised the decision to make a "clean" adaptation of the novel, as well as the film's realism. However, "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" gave the film a negative review that criticized its editing, its direction, and Whitney's acting ability, suggesting that the film would profit solely on the name of the book it adapted.

Despite some critical reviews, the film was popular, especially with women, and financially successful. Double-file lines over a block long were reported for opening-week showings at the <a href="Audubon%20Ballroom">Audubon Theatre</a> in New York. After the incorporation of the <a href="Fox%20Film%20Corporation">Fox Film Corporation</a>, distribution of this film continued under the new company's name. The success of the initial New York showings featured in subsequent advertising, as did Fox's greatly inflated claims of the cost of production.

The <a href="1937%20Fox%20vault%20fire">1937 Fox vault fire</a> destroyed most of Fox's silent films, probably including "Life's Shop Window". The <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> is not aware of any extant copies.

2015 Vuelta a España

The 2015 Vuelta a España was a three-week <a href="Grand%20Tour%20%28cycling%29">Grand Tour</a> <a href="cycling%20stage%20race">cycling race</a>. The race was the 70th edition of the <a href="Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">Vuelta a España</a> and took place principally in <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, although two <a href="race%20stage">stages</a> took place partly or wholly in <a href="Andorra">Andorra</a>, and was the 22nd race in the <a href="2015%20UCI%20World%20Tour">2015 UCI World Tour</a>. The race included 21 stages, beginning in <a href="Marbella">Marbella</a> on 22 August 2015 and finishing in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> on 13 September. It was won by <a href="Fabio%20Aru">Fabio Aru</a> (<a href="Astana%20Pro%20Team">Astana Pro Team</a>), with <a href="Joaquim%20Rodr%C3%ADguez">Joaquim Rodríguez</a> () second and <a href="Rafa%C5%82%20Majka">Rafał Majka</a> () third.

The early leaders of the race were <a href="Esteban%20Chaves">Esteban Chaves</a> () and <a href="Tom%20Dumoulin">Tom Dumoulin</a> (), who exchanged the leader's <a href="General%20classification%20in%20the%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">red jersey</a> several times during the first ten days of racing, with both riders winning <a href="glossary%20of%20cycling%23Summit%20finish">summit finishes</a> in the first week. Aru took over the race lead following the mountainous Stage 11, which took place entirely within Andorra. He kept his lead for five stages as the race entered the mountains of northern Spain, but lost it to Rodríguez on Stage 16. Dumoulin took the lead back on Stage 17 – the race's only <a href="individual%20time%20trial">individual time trial</a> – with Aru three seconds behind in second place. Aru <a href="glossary%20of%20cycling%23Attack">attacked</a> throughout the final stages and, on the penultimate day, finally <a href="glossary%20of%20cycling%23Drop">dropped</a> Dumoulin, who fell to sixth place overall. Aru therefore took the first Grand Tour victory of his career.

The <a href="points%20classification%20in%20the%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">points classification</a> was decided during the final stage and was won by <a href="Alejandro%20Valverde">Alejandro Valverde</a> (), while Rodriguez won the <a href="Combination%20classification%20in%20the%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">combination classification</a>. The <a href="Mountains%20classification%20in%20the%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">mountains classification</a> was won by <a href="Omar%20Fraile">Omar Fraile</a> (). Dumoulin won the combativity award, while Movistar won the team prize.

The seventeen <a href="List%20of%202015%20UCI%20WorldTeams%20and%20riders">UCI WorldTeams</a> were automatically invited and obliged to attend the race. The organiser of the Vuelta, , was also able to invite five <a href="UCI%20Professional%20Continental">UCI Professional Continental</a> teams – the second tier of professional cycling teams – as <a href="wild%20card%20%28sports%29">wildcards</a>. These were announced on 20 March 2015. , the only Spanish-registered Professional Continental team, was one of those invited, along with two French teams, and . were invited for the second consecutive year after also securing their first ever entry into the <a href="2015%20Tour%20de%20France">Tour de France</a>. The final team to be invited was . One prominent team to miss out on an entry was .

The team presentation took place in <a href="Benahav%C3%ADs">Benahavís</a> on the evening before the first stage. The number of riders allowed per squad was nine, therefore the start list contained a total of 198 riders. The riders represented 37 different countries, with the largest numbers coming from France (30), Spain (27) and Italy (20). The average age of riders in the Vuelta was 29.13 years, ranging from the 20-year-old <a href="Matej%20Mohori%C4%8D">Matej Mohorič</a> () to the 38-year-old <a href="Haimar%20Zubeldia">Haimar Zubeldia</a> ().

The teams entering the race were:

The top four riders from the 2015 Tour de France all chose to start the Vuelta. These were <a href="Chris%20Froome">Chris Froome</a> (), <a href="Nairo%20Quintana">Nairo Quintana</a> and <a href="Alejandro%20Valverde">Alejandro Valverde</a> (both ) and <a href="Vincenzo%20Nibali">Vincenzo Nibali</a> (), all of whom had previously won <a href="Grand%20Tour%20%28cycling%29">Grand Tour</a>s. The most notable absentee from among the <a href="List%20of%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a%20general%20classification%20winners">general classification</a> contenders was <a href="Alberto%20Contador">Alberto Contador</a> (), the winner of the 2014 Vuelta. <a href="Oleg%20Tinkov">Oleg Tinkov</a>, the owner of the Tinkoff-Saxo team, had challenged Contador, Froome, Nibali and Quintana to attempt to ride all three Grand Tours in 2015; none of the riders took up the challenge. Froome, Nibali and Quintana all declined to ride the Giro and, as Contador was attempting to win both the Giro d'Italia and the Tour, he did not aim to ride the Vuelta. Valverde and Nibali were the only two previous winners of the race to start the 2015 edition.

Froome, who had been second in the <a href="2011%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">2011</a> and <a href="2014%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">2014</a> Vueltas, had had a strong season, with victories in the , the <a href="2015%20Crit%C3%A9rium%20du%20Dauphin%C3%A9">Critérium du Dauphiné</a> and the Tour de France. He was attempting to become the first rider since <a href="Bernard%20Hinault">Bernard Hinault</a> in 1978 to win both the Tour and the Vuelta in the same season, though it was expected that he would be tired following his victory in the Tour. The <a href="individual%20time%20trial">individual time trial</a> was expected to favour Froome, who is strong in the discipline. Before the race, however, Froome was uncertain about his form and his ability to win the race. Quintana's only stage race victory of the season had come in the <a href="2015%20Tirreno%E2%80%93Adriatico">Tirreno–Adriatico</a>, but he had performed strongly in the <a href="Alps">Alps</a> in the Tour's final stages, and the mountainous route of the Vuelta was expected to suit him.

Vincenzo Nibali, who had won the Vuelta in <a href="2010%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">2010</a>, had struggled in the opening stages of the Tour, but had recovered to take a stage victory in the final week. The Astana team also included <a href="Fabio%20Aru">Fabio Aru</a> and <a href="Mikel%20Landa">Mikel Landa</a>, second and third respectively at the <a href="2015%20Giro%20d%27Italia">Giro d'Italia</a>; while this made a strong team, it was unclear which rider would be favoured by the team and given the assistance of his teammates. There was a similar situation at Movistar, as Valverde, who had won the Vuelta in <a href="2009%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">2009</a> and had finished on the podium on four other occasions, was also in strong form and was well suited to the course. Also among the general classification contenders were <a href="Joaquim%20Rodr%C3%ADguez">Joaquim Rodríguez</a> (), <a href="Rafa%C5%82%20Majka">Rafał Majka</a> () and <a href="Tejay%20van%20Garderen">Tejay van Garderen</a> ().

Other notable riders to take part in the race included several <a href="cycling%20sprinter">sprinters</a>. One of these was <a href="Peter%20Sagan">Peter Sagan</a> (), four times the winner of the <a href="points%20classification%20in%20the%20Tour%20de%20France">points classification in the Tour de France</a> and winner of three stages in the 2011 Vuelta, who was preparing for the <a href="2015%20UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20road%20race">World Championships road race</a> the following month. Sagan was considered particularly strong on the easier uphill finishes in the first week. <a href="John%20Degenkolb">John Degenkolb</a> () had won four stages and the <a href="points%20classification%20in%20the%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">points classification</a> in 2014 as well as five stages in <a href="2012%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">2012</a>. <a href="Nacer%20Bouhanni">Nacer Bouhanni</a> (), who had crashed out of the Tour, was expected to compete with Degenkolb in the flat sprints.

The first announcement of the route for the 2015 Vuelta a España came in October 2014, when Javier Guillén, the race director, announced that the first stage would take place in <a href="Puerto%20Ban%C3%BAs">Puerto Banús</a> near <a href="Marbella">Marbella</a> on 22 August. It had been decided that the stage would be either an individual time trial or a <a href="team%20time%20trial">team time trial</a>. More news came the following month, when Guillén revealed that he had been involved in conversations with Chris Froome and had promised him that the race would include a fairly flat individual time trial of around . He also said that the race would feature "explosive finals and summit finishes". The official route announcement came on 10 January 2015 in <a href="Torremolinos">Torremolinos</a>, along the coast from the start of the first stage in Puerto Banús.

The first five stages took place in and around <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a> in southern Spain; the 2014 Vuelta had also started there. The first stage was a team time trial along the coast from Puerto Banús to Marbella. The next four stages were fairly flat, although Stage 2 finished on a moderately difficult climb. The sixth stage started in <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Andalusia">Córdoba</a> and finished in <a href="Sierra%20de%20Cazorla">Sierra de Cazorla</a> in <a href="Ja%C3%A9n%2C%20Spain">Jaén</a> on another moderately difficult climb. The seventh stage then returned to Andalusia for the first major difficulty of the race: the <a href="%23Classification%20leadership%20table">first-category</a> summit finish at <a href="La%20Alpujarra">La Alpujarra</a>. The route then continued along the eastern coast of Spain, with a medium-mountain seventh stage and another first-category summit finish at <a href="Benitachell">Benitachell</a> on Stage 9. There was one more medium-mountain stage on Stage 10, taking the riders into the <a href="Province%20of%20Castell%C3%B3n">Province of Castellón</a>. This was followed by a transfer that took the riders into <a href="Andorra">Andorra</a> for a three-day spell, beginning with the first rest day. The eleventh stage took place entirely in Andorra; though it was only in length, it included six categorised climbs, including a summit finish, and was described by <a href="Eusebio%20Unzu%C3%A9">Eusebio Unzué</a> (the manager of the Movistar team) as "the toughest Vuelta stage that he has seen in more than 30 years". Stage 12 took the riders back into Spain for a fairly flat stage, before three consecutive stages with summit finishes. These took place in the mountains of <a href="Cantabria">Cantabria</a> and <a href="Asturias">Asturias</a> and were followed by the race's second rest day. The final week of the race included no summit finishes: the first stage was a individual time trial in <a href="Burgos">Burgos</a> and was then followed by three mixed stages that took the riders nearer to the final stage of the race, a sprint stage in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>. For the first time, the race organisers also held a women's race on the same day as the final stage, using the same circuit. This race – called <a href="2015%20La%20Madrid%20Challenge%20by%20La%20Vuelta">La Madrid Challenge by La Vuelta</a> – was won by <a href="Shelley%20Olds">Shelley Olds</a>.

The 2015 Vuelta included nine summit finishes, none of which had previously been used in the race. Unusually, the principal difficulties of the race came in the first two weeks, including all nine summit finishes. It was therefore expected that the climbers would need to attack early in the race, in order to build up a significant lead ahead of the lengthy time trial on Stage 17. The race organisers also hoped to encourage sprinters to take part by including seven fairly flat stages.

Each road stage (that is, all the stages except the team time trial and the individual time trial) included an <a href="glossary%20of%20cycling%23intermediate%20sprint">intermediate sprint</a>. This was a point where the leading riders in the stage were awarded points in the points classification and time bonuses in the general classification. Many of the stages also included climbs that were categorised by the race organisers according to their difficulty; the leading riders over each of these climbs were awarded points in the mountains classification, with the most difficult climbs earning the most points.

In the days before the beginning of the race, there was controversy over the first stage. On arriving at the start, the teams discovered that the route used a variety of road surfaces, crossed sandy sections and included several ramps. As a result, the race organisers decided to neutralise the stage: the teams therefore competed only for the stage victory and for the team classification, not for the general classification.

The team time trial was won by and <a href="Peter%20Velits">Peter Velits</a> took the red jersey as the first rider across the line. Since the stage had been neutralised for the general classification, all 198 riders began the second stage on the same time. The stage finished on a moderate climb, where <a href="Esteban%20Chaves">Esteban Chaves</a> () attacked early and took both the stage victory and the lead of the race. A major crash in the final brought down several riders and most riders in the <a href="peloton">peloton</a> (the main group) were held up, including Fabio Aru and Vincenzo Nibali (). Aru quickly rejoined the peloton; Nibali was forced to chase for a long time. After the stage, a video emerged of Nibali holding on to his team car as it accelerated him back to the peloton. Nibali was therefore fined and excluded from the race.

The next stage was a moderately difficult stage that ended in a <a href="bunch%20sprint">bunch sprint</a>. Peter Sagan won his first Grand Tour stage in over two years ahead of Nacer Bouhanni (Cofidis) and John Degenkolb (Giant-Alpecin). The fourth stage again included an uphill finish. This stage was also decided in a sprint finish, this time won by Alejandro Valverde. Sagan, who came second, took over the lead of the points classification. A third consecutive bunch sprint came on the fifth stage, which ended on a slight incline. The relatively straightforward stage was won by <a href="Caleb%20Ewan">Caleb Ewan</a> (), who was riding his first Grand Tour, ahead of Degenkolb and Sagan. There were splits in the peloton at the finish; Chaves lost six seconds to <a href="Tom%20Dumoulin">Tom Dumoulin</a> (), who therefore took over the red jersey of the race leader by one second. This lead did not last long. The sixth stage finished on another moderate climb. Chaves again attacked early in the climb and took his second stage victory, with <a href="Dan%20Martin%20%28cyclist%29">Dan Martin</a> () second and Dumoulin third. Chaves therefore took back the red jersey.

The seventh stage was the most significant uphill finish of the race so far, finishing on the climb of the Alto de Capileira. It was won by <a href="Bert-Jan%20Lindeman">Bert-Jan Lindeman</a> () from the breakaway. Most of the general classification favourites finished together, though Fabio Aru gained seven seconds in the final kilometre and Chris Froome lost nearly half a minute. The following stage was a moderately difficult stage: it was too difficult for the pure sprinters to reach the finish line with the main group of riders, but not difficult enough to create gaps between those riding for the overall victory. The most notable event was a large crash from the finish. Four riders were immediately forced to withdraw from the race with injuries, including Dan Martin, who had been in the top ten. The stage was won in a reduced bunch sprint by <a href="Jasper%20Stuyven">Jasper Stuyven</a> (), who had been among the riders injured in the earlier crash. He was forced to withdraw from the race after the stage with a broken <a href="scaphoid">scaphoid</a>. Stage 9 ended with a difficult climb. There was a series of attacks on the early part of the mountain, with many riders dropped from the lead group. Tom Dumoulin eventually took a solo win in the stage, two seconds ahead of Chris Froome, and took back the red jersey as Chaves lost significant time. Froome had originally been dropped, but rode at a steady tempo and came close to the stage victory. Stage 10, the final stage before the first rest day, ended in another bunch sprint, which was won by <a href="Kristian%20Sbaragli">Kristian Sbaragli</a> ().
The eleventh stage, the first after the rest day, was the difficult stage in Andorra, with six difficult climbs and almost no flat roads. The stage was won from a breakaway by Mikel Landa (Astana). Fabio Aru, Landa's teammate, took second place and moved into the race lead. Chris Froome fell from his bike at the beginning of the stage and lost several minutes to Aru; the following morning it was revealed that he had broken his foot in the fall and he withdrew from the race. Nairo Quintana also lost several minutes on the stage. The following stage, which took the riders from Andorra back into Spain, was won in a sprint by <a href="Danny%20van%20Poppel">Danny van Poppel</a> () after the day's breakaway was caught in the final kilometre. Van Poppel won the stage despite puncturing his tyre with remaining. The thirteenth stage – the last one before a series of three consecutive summit finishes – was won from a breakaway by <a href="Nelson%20Oliveira">Nelson Oliveira</a> (), with no impact on the general classification.

The first of the three summit finishes – Stage 14 – was won by <a href="Alessandro%20De%20Marchi%20%28cyclist%29">Alessandro De Marchi</a> (), who had been in the day's breakaway. Quintana gained several seconds back, while Aru, Rodríguez, Chaves and Majka all gained time on Dumoulin. Rodríguez attacked strongly on the final climb to win Stage 15 and gained time on all his rivals, putting himself just one second behind Aru. Dumoulin lost further time to Aru, Majka and Chaves. The final stage with a summit finish was Stage 16: it was a difficult stage including seven climbs and was won by <a href="Fr%C3%A4nk%20Schleck">Fränk Schleck</a> (Trek Factory Racing). On the final climb, Rodríguez gained two seconds on Aru in the final metres to put himself into the race lead for the final rest day, while Dumoulin lost more time and was nearly two minutes back.
After the rest day came the race's individual time trial. It was won by Dumoulin, who was more than a minute ahead of all the other riders in the race. His time was good enough to put him into the overall race lead. Aru rode strongly, and was only three seconds behind Dumoulin in the general classification after the stage. Rodríguez lost over three minutes to Dumoulin. Majka also lost significant time to Aru and Dumoulin and fell to fourth place.

Following the time trial, there were three mountainous stages, although none of them had a summit finish. All three were won by riders from breakaways. <a href="Nicolas%20Roche">Nicolas Roche</a> (Sky) won Stage 18, beating Haimar Zubeldia (Trek Factory Racing) in a two-man sprint. After his team had put pressure on the peloton through the whole stage, Aru attacked Dumoulin six times on the final climb, and Valverde put in three more attacks. Dumoulin, however, did not lose any time and retained his three-second lead. Stage 19 ended with a short, cobbled climb into <a href="%C3%81vila%2C%20Spain">Ávila</a>. It was won by <a href="Alexis%20Gougeard">Alexis Gougeard</a> (), who had escaped from the breakaway group on the previous climb. The day's racing also produced another crash: this time Aru fell to the ground. Although he had to make several trips to the medical car, he did not seem seriously injured. At the end of the stage, Dumoulin used his team to put him in a strong position for the cobbled climb and he increased his lead over Aru to six seconds. Stage 20 was the final day of mountainous terrain, including four difficult climbs. It was won by <a href="Rub%C3%A9n%20Plaza">Rubén Plaza</a> (Lampre-Mérida) after a solo breakaway that lasted over three hours. Aru's Astana team rode hard in the second half of the stage and, with a strong team effort, they were eventually able to drop Dumoulin on the penultimate climb of the day; he dropped further back on the final climb and lost nearly four minutes, dropping to sixth place overall. Quintana and Majka gained nearly a minute on the other general classification rivals. This meant that Aru took the race lead, with Rodríguez second and Majka third.

The final stage of the race was a flat stage that finished in Madrid. It was won in a sprint by Degenkolb. During the stage, Valverde took advantage of a puncture for Rodríguez and won the intermediate sprint to give him the points jersey. Although Aru lost a little time in a split in the peloton at the finish line, the rest of the standings were unchanged. Aru therefore won the race, his first Grand Tour victory.

The 2015 Vuelta a España included four principal classifications. The first of these was the general classification, which was calculated by adding up each rider's times on each stage and applying the relevant time bonuses. These were 10 seconds for the stage winner, 6 seconds for the rider in second, and 4 seconds for the rider in third, and 3, 2 and 1 seconds for the first three riders at each intermediate sprint; no bonuses were awarded on the time trial stages. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Vuelta. The rider leading the classification wore a red jersey.

The second classification was the points classification. Riders were awarded points for finishing in the top fifteen places on each stage and in the top three at each intermediate sprint. The first rider at each stage finish was awarded 25 points, the second 20 points, the third 16 points, the fourth 14 points, the fifth 12 points, the sixth 10 points, down to 1 point for the rider in fifteenth. At the intermediate sprints, the first three riders won 4, 2 and 1 points respectively. The rider with the most points won the classification and wore a green jersey.

The third classification was the <a href="Mountains%20classification%20in%20the%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">mountains classification</a>. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs. Stages were categorised as third-, second-, first- and special-category, with the more difficult climbs rated higher. The most difficult climb of the race, the Alto Ermita de Alba on Stage 16, was given its own category as the <a href="Cima%20Alberto%20Fern%C3%A1ndez">Cima Alberto Fernández</a>. Points were awarded for the first riders across the summit of each climb; the rider with the most accumulated points won the classification and wore a white jersey with blue polka dots.

The final individual classification was the <a href="Combination%20classification%20in%20the%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">combination classification</a>. This was calculated by adding up each rider's position on the other three individual classifications. The rider with the lowest cumulative score was the winner of the classification and wore a white jersey.

The final classification was a <a href="Team%20classification%20in%20the%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">team classification</a>. This was calculated by adding together the times of each team's best three riders on each stage. The team with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the classification. There was also a combativity prize awarded on each stage; three riders were chosen on each stage by a race jury to recognise the rider "who displayed the most courageous effort". There was then a public vote to decide which rider should be awarded the prize; the rider wore a red "dossard" (race number) the following day. An identical procedure took place on the final stage to decide the most combative rider of the whole Vuelta.

Shine (Gwen Stefani song)

"Shine" is a song recorded by American singer <a href="Gwen%20Stefani">Gwen Stefani</a>, featuring collaborative vocals by American entertainer <a href="Pharrell%20Williams">Pharrell Williams</a>. Originally intended for Stefani's band <a href="No%20Doubt">No Doubt</a>, it was written and produced by Williams, with songwriting contributions from Stefani. It is a <a href="Reggae%20fusion">reggae pop</a> and <a href="ska">ska</a> song that is featured in the 2014 animated film "<a href="Paddington%20%28film%29">Paddington</a>." The lyrics revolve around the lead character <a href="Paddington%20Bear">Paddington Bear</a>'s journey to London and his identity crisis. Stefani initially disagreed with Williams' choice to use direct references to Paddington in the lyrics, but praised this decision after watching the film with her children. She reported that her involvement with the recording was inspired by her then-husband <a href="Gavin%20Rossdale">Gavin Rossdale</a> and her children's connection to England.

A <a href="lyric%20video">lyric video</a> for the track was released on January 31, 2015, on <a href="The%20Weinstein%20Company">The Weinstein Company</a>'s <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> channel, and included on the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the film. The song was featured in the American trailer for the movie, and made available as a promotional <a href="CD%20single">CD</a> as a result of its submission for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Song">Academy Award for Best Original Song</a>. Although a low-quality version leaked on December 31, 2014, a full version of the recording was not released for public consumption. It was omitted from the film's soundtrack album, as well as Stefani's third studio album "<a href="This%20Is%20What%20the%20Truth%20Feels%20Like">This Is What the Truth Feels Like</a>" (2016). Critical response to "Shine" was mixed; some praised Stefani and Williams' chemistry, while others compared it negatively to their previous collaborations. Commentators frequently likened it to Williams' 2013 single "<a href="Happy%20%28Pharrell%20Williams%20song%29">Happy</a>" and Stefani's 2014 song "<a href="Spark%20the%20Fire">Spark the Fire</a>".

 "Shine" was written by <a href="Pharrell%20Williams">Pharrell Williams</a> and <a href="Gwen%20Stefani">Gwen Stefani</a>, and produced by Williams. In November 2014, the pair announced that they were collaborating on a recording for the animated film "<a href="Paddington%20%28film%29">Paddington</a>". They had previously worked together on four singles: "<a href="Hella%20Good">Hella Good</a>" (2002), "<a href="Can%20I%20Have%20It%20Like%20That">Can I Have It Like That</a>" (2005), "<a href="Hollaback%20Girl">Hollaback Girl</a>" (2005), and "<a href="Spark%20the%20Fire">Spark the Fire</a>" (2014). 

Williams initially pitched "Shine" as a song for <a href="No%20Doubt">No Doubt</a>, of which Stefani was lead vocalist. She immediately noticed similarities between the <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demo</a> and her music with No Doubt and played it for the rest of the band to get their reaction. No Doubt recorded their version in late 2014. According to "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", Stefani was collaborating with the band for a song for the "Paddington" soundtrack. Despite this announcement, "Rolling Stone"s Patrick Doyle suggested that it would be recorded by Williams and Stefani instead. 

In an official statement, film executive <a href="Bob%20Weinstein">Bob Weinstein</a> called Stefani and Williams "the perfect artistic duo", saying their work "brought to life the charm that <a href="Paddington%20Bear">Paddington</a> represents". Stefani said her involvement was motivated by her personal connection to the film's setting through her marriage to English musician <a href="Gavin%20Rossdale">Gavin Rossdale</a>. She added that the film and the track allowed her children to recognise their origins. Williams considered the song to be "a wonderful opportunity, as a parent, to contribute to something as classic, authentic and generational to all of our lives, as Paddington Bear"; Stefani said that she was "honored to join forces with Pharrell and be part of bringing this beloved classic to life for Paddington's next big adventure". Williams called the song "a trailer into a wonderful family experience" and developed its concept from his children's interest in Paddington Bear.

"Shine" is a <a href="Reggae%20fusion">reggae pop</a> and <a href="ska">ska</a> song that lasts three minutes and 24 seconds. It is composed in the key of <a href="E%20minor">E minor</a> using <a href="common%20time">common time</a> and a moderately fast <a href="tempo">tempo</a> of 140 beats per minute. Instrumentation is provided by <a href="String%20%28music%29">strings</a>, <a href="Horn%20%28instrument%29">horns</a>, a <a href="guitar">guitar</a>, and a <a href="piano">piano</a>, to create what Music Times' Carolyn Menyes described as a "crawling beat". March Robisch of "<a href="Thought%20Catalog">Thought Catalog</a>" described the single as having "that ska quality that made No Doubt so successful". "<a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>"'s Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson wrote that it is a "ska-flecked romp of pumped-up foghorns and plodding brass". A writer from <a href="Capital%20XTRA">Capital XTRA</a> described it as having a "mellow beat", while "Rolling Stone"'s Daniel Sannwald wrote it has a "party-vibe production".

During the track, Stefani's <a href="vocal%20range">vocal range</a> spans from the low note of D to the high note of A. Williams equated Stefani's tone to that of a "child whisperer" due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels; "Rolling Stone" called it "a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an identity crisis". The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the <a href="Refrain">chorus</a>, the lyrics including "When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / Look at yourself in the mirror / That's your way home". The <a href="Hook%20%28music%29">hook</a> features Stefani repeatedly singing "Shine!" and Williams screaming "Hey!". Andy Morris from "<a href="Gigwise">Gigwise</a>" noted the lyrics, "So we're in a strange new land in Paddington station / But you end up in good hands in the fancy British nation" and "that bear with the red hat", as obvious references to Paddington. According to Sannwald, the lyrics include "Pharrell's 'Happy"-ish 'Everybody is the same inside' <a href="Bridge%20%28music%29">bridge</a>" that allows the song to appeal to both children and their parents "without sounding overly patronizing". "Shine" ends with Williams singing in the <a href="falsetto">falsetto</a> register.

When discussing the development of the single with <a href="MTV%20News">MTV News</a>, Stefani said that she initially disagreed with Williams' approach to the lyrics. Williams was more "specific" regarding the lyrics as he wanted to include words directly connected to the film and its character like "bear", "Paddington", and "station"; Stefani said that she preferred for the song to be a "little more abstract". She later reversed this view, saying that she agreed with Williams' interpretation after watching the film with her children and seeing the complete animations of the Paddington Bear character. In an interview with "<a href="American%20Top%2040">American Top 40</a>", Stefani credited Williams as being central to the recording's development, saying that he was "the one who really got in there and was able to channel the film lyrically and make it really happen".

"Shine" received mixed reviews from <a href="Music%20criticism">music critics</a>. "<a href="E%21%20News">E! News</a>" Bruna Nessif gave the single a positive review, stating: "When it comes to feel-good music, leave it up to Gwen Stefani and Pharrell to get the job done". A reviewer from <a href="Vibe%20%28magazine%29">"Vibe"</a> praised it as "the perfect theme song". Abe Dewing, a member of the Cambridge Symphony Orchestra, described it as a "sharp, hip tune" in the "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>." He compared its opening trumpet riff to music by British composer <a href="Herbert%20Chappell">Herbert Chappell</a>, who created the theme for the 1975 television series <a href="Paddington%20%281975%20TV%20series%29">"Paddington"</a>. Chappell also composed music for the 1986 <a href="concerto">concerto</a> "Paddington Bear's First Concert". Dewing praised Stefani and Willams' ability "to compose new music for existing source material intended for children". A reviewer from the website antiMusic described the recording as "even more feel good" than the pair's collaboration on "Spark the Fire". Daniel Sannwald gave it three and a half stars out of five, favorably comparing its melody to the chorus of Irish <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="The%20Cranberries">The Cranberries</a>'s 1994 single "<a href="Zombie%20%28song%29">Zombie</a>". He felt that it would appeal to both children and their parents.

Some reviewers criticized "Shine" for lacking the energy of Williams' and Stefani's previous releases. <a href="MTV">MTV</a>'s John Walker questioned whether it could repeat the success of Williams' previous single "Happy" from the 2013 animated film "<a href="Despicable%20Me%202">Despicable Me 2</a>". In response to the leaked version, Carolyn Menyes wrote that it was too slow in comparison to the "crazy, happy beats and earwormmy hand claps" of "Happy" and the "inane catchiness" of Stefani's previous singles "Spark the Fire" and "<a href="Baby%20Don%27t%20Lie">Baby Don't Lie</a>" (2014). Menyes was critical of Stefani's vocals, saying she used "an oddly harsh tone" throughout the track. Steven Pond of "<a href="TheWrap">TheWrap</a>" wrote that Stefani's vocal delivery "never quite crosses the line to catchy".

Although a low-quality version leaked on December 31, 2014, a full version of the recording was not made available for the public. A limited quantity edition <a href="CD%20single">CD single</a> was issued in January 2015, and sent to the <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> as part of the submission process to be considered for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Song">Academy Award for Best Original Song</a>. The single was included in the list of 79 contenders for the award, but it did not receive a nomination.

A <a href="lyric%20video">lyric video</a> was uploaded onto The Weinstein Company's <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> channel on January 13, 2015. It was a minute and 35 seconds, and featured clips from the film. The video received over two million views in 24 hours. The video featured scenes from the film in which "the iconic <a href="Peru">Peru</a>vian bear finds himself in all manner of mishaps while trying to find a home and ultimately working his way into our hearts". The visual was included on the DVD and Blu-ray releases of "Paddington" along with a behind-the-scenes feature on the making of the track. Matthew Jacobson of "The Spectrum", a newspaper which is part of the <a href="USA%20Today%20Network">USA Today Network</a>, criticized the video for being "just clips of the movie set to a song" rather than a proper music video. Alternatively, Cinemablend.com's Jessica Rawden found the video to be "satsifying".

"Shine" is featured in the American trailer and the <a href="closing%20credits">closing credits</a> for "Paddington," but was not included in the British version of the film. <a href="Idolator%20%28website%29">Idolator</a>'s Christina Lee wrote that the track was an exclusive release for the United States and Canada. The song was excluded from the film's soundtrack album, as well as Stefani's third studio album "<a href="This%20Is%20What%20the%20Truth%20Feels%20Like">This Is What the Truth Feels Like</a>" (2016). During an interview with Stefani and Williams on January 21, 2015, radio host <a href="Ryan%20Seacrest">Ryan Seacrest</a> erroneously announced the track was available for purchase on the <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a>.

William Joseph "Bill" Denny, (6 December 1872 – 2 May 1946) was a <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>n journalist, lawyer, politician and decorated soldier who held the <a href="South%20Australian%20House%20of%20Assembly">South Australian House of Assembly</a> seats of <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20West%20Adelaide">West Adelaide</a> from 1900 to 1902 and then <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Adelaide">Adelaide</a> from 1902 to 1905 and again from 1906 to 1933. After an unsuccessful candidacy as a <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20%28South%20Australian%20Branch%29">United Labor Party</a> (ULP) member in 1899, he was elected as an "<a href="Independent%20politician">independent</a> <a href="Liberalism">liberal</a>" in a by-election in 1900. He was re-elected in 1902, but defeated in 1905. The following year, he was elected as a ULP candidate, and retained his seat for that party (the Australian Labor Party from 1917) until 1931. Along with the rest of the cabinet, he was ejected from the Australian Labor Party in 1931, and was a member of the <a href="Parliamentary%20Labor%20Party">Parliamentary Labor Party</a> until his electoral defeat at the hands of a <a href="Lang%20Labor%20Party%20%28South%20Australia%29">Lang Labor Party</a> candidate in 1933.

Denny was the <a href="Attorney-General%20of%20South%20Australia">Attorney-General of South Australia</a> and Minister for the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> in the government led by <a href="John%20Verran">John Verran</a> (1910–12). In August 1915, Denny enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">First Australian Imperial Force</a> to serve in World War I, initially as a trooper in the <a href="9th%20Light%20Horse%20Regiment">9th Light Horse Regiment</a>. After being <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commissioned</a> in 1916, he served in the <a href="5th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">5th Division Artillery</a> and <a href="1st%20Division%20%28Australia%29">1st Divisional Artillery</a> on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. He was awarded the Military Cross in September 1917 when he was wounded while leading a convoy into forward areas near <a href="Ypres">Ypres</a>, and ended the war as a <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a>.

He was again Attorney-General in the Labor governments led by <a href="John%20Gunn%20%28Australian%20politician%29">John Gunn</a> (1924–26), <a href="Lionel%20Hill">Lionel Hill</a> (1930–33) and <a href="Robert%20Richards%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Robert Richards</a> (1933), and held other <a href="Ministry%20%28government%20department%29">portfolios</a> in those governments, including housing, irrigation and repatriation. Denny published two memoirs of his military service, and when he died in 1946 aged 73, he was accorded a <a href="state%20funeral">state funeral</a>.

William Joseph Denny was born in <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>, on 6 December 1872, one of three children of Thomas Joseph Denny, a publican, and his wife Annie ( Dwyer). He attended <a href="Christian%20Brothers%20College%2C%20Adelaide">Christian Brothers College, Adelaide</a>, then worked as a weather clerk at the <a href="General%20Post%20Office%2C%20Adelaide">General Post Office, Adelaide</a> under the <a href="Postmaster%20General">Postmaster General</a>, <a href="Charles%20Todd%20%28pioneer%29">Sir Charles Todd</a>. According to a contemporary source, in 1893 he became the editor of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> <a href="The%20Southern%20Cross%20%28South%20Australia%29">"The Southern Cross"</a> newspaper, which published news about and for the Catholic community of South Australia. A more recent source states he commenced as editor of "The Southern Cross" in 1896. He replaced <a href="James%20O%27Loghlin%20%28Australian%20politician%29">James O'Loghlin</a>, who later became a <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20%28South%20Australian%20Branch%29">United Labor Party</a> (ULP) <a href="Australian%20Senate">senator</a> for South Australia. Denny was a <a href="councillor">councillor</a> of the <a href="Adelaide%20City%20Council">Adelaide City Council</a> from 1898, representing Grey Ward. During his early twenties he was active in the literary and debating societies of Adelaide, was Chairman of the Christian Brothers Old Collegians Association, and captain of two city rowing clubs. He unsuccessfully contested the two-member <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20West%20Adelaide">seat of West Adelaide</a> in the <a href="South%20Australian%20colonial%20election%2C%201899">1899 South Australian colonial election</a> as a ULP candidate, gaining 27.7 per cent of the vote.

When a by-election was held for <a href="West%20Adelaide%20colonial%20by-election%2C%201900">West Adelaide</a> on 17 March 1900, Denny was elected to the single vacancy created by the resignation of the former <a href="Premier%20of%20South%20Australia">Premier of South Australia</a>, <a href="Charles%20Kingston">Charles Kingston</a>. He ran as an "<a href="Independent%20politician">independent</a> <a href="Liberalism">liberal</a>" candidate, gaining 66.8 per cent of the vote. Prior to the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201902">1902 state election</a> the electoral district of West Adelaide was abolished. Denny contested the new four-member <a href="electoral%20district%20of%20Adelaide">electoral district of Adelaide</a>, and was elected second in the count with 14.3 per cent of the votes cast. He was defeated at the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201905">1905 state election</a>, gaining only 9.9 per cent of the votes. The following year, having abandoned his former liberalism, he contested the seat of Adelaide at the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201906">state election</a> as a ULP candidate, and was elected first, receiving 19.3 per cent of the votes cast. He was again returned first at the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201910">1910 state election</a>, after which the ULP led by <a href="John%20Verran">John Verran</a> formed the first Labor government of South Australia on 3 June. Having begun studying law at the <a href="University%20of%20Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a> in 1903, Denny was <a href="Articled%20clerk">articled</a> to J.R. Anderson , and was admitted as a <a href="solicitor">solicitor</a> in the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20South%20Australia">Supreme Court of South Australia</a> in 1908.

Denny was appointed <a href="Attorney-General%20of%20South%20Australia">Attorney-General of South Australia</a> and Minister controlling the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> on 3 June 1910. After conducting negotiations with the <a href="Commonwealth%20Government">Commonwealth Government</a>, he relinquished his ministerial responsibility for the Northern Territory on 31 December 1910, when its administration was transferred to the Commonwealth. During his time as Attorney-General, Denny drafted and led several important legislative reforms. These included the "Advances for Homes Act 1910", which allowed for 80 per cent of the value of a property to be advanced to a worker at 4.5 per cent interest over 36.5 years. In his speeches Denny highlighted that many workers were faced with high rents and poor conditions. He also sponsored the "Female Law Practitioners Act 1911", which enabled women to practice law in South Australia for the first time. Tall, with "long, spindly legs", Denny was a favourite of cartoonists.

Verran called an <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201912">election in February 1912</a>, and the ULP were defeated by the <a href="Liberal%20Union%20%28Australia%29">Liberal Union</a>, although Denny was again returned first in the seat of Adelaide with 15.8 per cent of votes cast. He became a member of the University of Adelaide Council in April 1912, as a representative of the Parliament. In 1913, a <a href="referendum">referendum</a> to fix the closing time of licensed premises was proposed by the ULP. Even after the governing Liberal Union agreed to the conduct of the referendum at the next state election, Denny attacked them, claiming that they had no intention of implementing the outcome of the referendum if they were re-elected. Denny was returned unopposed at the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201915">March 1915 state election</a>.

Denny enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) on 17 August 1915 at the age of 43, initially as a <a href="Trooper%20%28rank%29">trooper</a>. Before departing overseas, Denny had always been an advocate of <a href="conscription">conscription</a>. He was later commissioned as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the <a href="9th%20Light%20Horse%20Regiment">9th Light Horse Regiment</a>. While in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, he transferred to the divisional <a href="artillery">artillery</a> of the <a href="5th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">5th Division</a>, which then shipped to France, and he was promoted to <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in June 1916. In January 1917, despite his previous stance on conscription, Denny refused requests to endorse it, instead stating that he did not think that intervention would be compatible with his duties as a soldier. He also considered that the majority of soldiers voted against it, and deplored the split in the Labor Party that conscription had created. In mid-1917 he was attached to the divisional artillery of the <a href="1st%20Division%20%28Australia%29">1st Division</a>. On the night of 15 September 1917, he was leading a convoy carrying water to forward areas when it was hit by a heavy artillery barrage, and he was wounded. His recommendation for the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> read:

For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty whilst engaged in pack transport work near HOGGE on the night of 15 September 1917. Lieutenant DENNY showed great coolness and initiative throughout, especially when his convoy came under very heavy barrage in the vicinity of CLAPHAM JUNCTION. Although wounded himself, Lieut. DENNY personally obtained assistance for two of his men who were wounded. He then reorganised his command and succeeded in reaching his destination. Lieut. DENNY after delivering this water then went to the dressing station where he dictated a report to D.H.Q. before being evacuated.

He was invested with the Military Cross by King <a href="George%20V">George V</a> at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> in November 1917. After recovering from his wounds, he was attached to the <a href="repatriation">repatriation</a> section of AIF Administrative Headquarters in London from January 1918. He was promoted to <a href="captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a> in September that year. He resigned his commission in the AIF in 1919 and published a memoir titled "The Diggers", the foreword of which was written by <a href="General">General</a> <a href="William%20Birdwood%2C%201st%20Baron%20Birdwood">Sir William Birdwood</a>, who had commanded the AIF from 1915 until the end of the war.

Still serving overseas at the time of the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201918">1918 state election</a>, Denny was returned first of three in Adelaide with 30.2 per cent of the ballots cast. He was repatriated to Australia via the United States on 2 August 1919, returning to his seat. While in the United States, he had been regularly published in the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald">New York Herald</a>". He married Winefride Mary Leahy, a pianist and singer, on 15 January 1920 at St. Ignatius Church, <a href="Norwood%2C%20South%20Australia">Norwood</a>. His brother, the Reverend Richard Denny, officiated at their wedding. He was elected second of two in <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201921">1921</a> and second of three in <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201924">1924</a> with similar proportions of the vote. He was appointed Attorney-General in the Labor government of <a href="John%20Gunn%20%28Australian%20politician%29">John Gunn</a> in April 1924, and was also Minister for Housing, and initially, Assistant Minister for Repatriation. In January 1925 he was appointed as Minister for Irrigation and Minister for Repatriation, while retaining his Attorney-General and housing portfolios.

During this period he carried out several significant legislative changes. In 1924, as Minister for Housing, Denny was closely associated with the <a href="Thousand%20Homes%20Scheme">Thousand Homes Scheme</a>, which aimed to provide affordable housing, particularly for returned soldiers and their families, and lower income groups. The land used for this development was the site of the <a href="Mitcham%2C%20South%20Australia">Mitcham</a> military camp at which Denny had trained before embarking for service overseas. Denny's work on the Scheme resulted in a clash with former Premier Sir <a href="Henry%20Barwell">Henry Barwell</a>, whom he sued for <a href="Defamation">libel</a> after Barwell made statements suggesting that Denny had made false statements to induce merchants to provide goods and services. Barwell later apologised for his comments.

Another change was the transition to the use of judges as the electoral <a href="returning%20officer">returning officer</a> for South Australia. This was done to impose state control on a system which had effectively combined the administration of the national and state electoral rolls. On 27 May 1925, Denny arranged the appointment of Judge <a href="Herbert%20Kingsley%20Paine">Herbert Kingsley Paine</a> of the Insolvency Court to be appointed as Electoral Officer for the state, replacing Charles Mathews, a state public servant who had held the position since 1907. Denny had previously worked for Paine as a legal associate.

As a returned soldier, Denny was an exception among Labor politicians at both state and federal level in the 1920s. Willing and able to speak about his personal war experiences, he was one of the few Labor politicians invited to unveil memorials. He performed this role for the Soldiers' Memorial Hall at <a href="Lameroo">Lameroo</a> in 1926, where his "address was punctuated with applause". When his political enemies persistently queried the circumstances under which he was awarded the Military Cross, he published the citation in response. Despite Labor's loss in the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201927">1927 state election</a>, Denny was returned first of three in the seat of Adelaide, with over 25 per cent of the vote. At the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201930">April 1930 state election</a>, he was returned first of three with nearly 82 per cent of the ballots cast. Appointed Attorney-General in the Labor government of <a href="Lionel%20Hill">Lionel Hill</a>, Denny was also Minister of Railways, and for the first six months he was also Minister of Local Government. On <a href="Anzac%20Day">Anzac Day</a> 1931, acting as Premier in Hill's absence, he officiated at the unveiling of the <a href="National%20War%20Memorial%20%28South%20Australia%29">National War Memorial</a> at the corner of <a href="North%20Terrace%2C%20Adelaide">North Terrace</a> and Kintore Avenue, Adelaide, before a crowd of about 75,000. Denny is one of only a few South Australian ministers to have ever had military experience.

In 1931, Denny was expelled from the Labor Party, along with Hill and the rest of the cabinet, for supporting the "<a href="Premiers%27%20Plan">Premiers' Plan</a>", which sought to impose austerity measures due to the poor economic conditions. The cabinet formed the <a href="Parliamentary%20Labor%20Party">Parliamentary Labor Party</a> which continued to govern the state, led by Hill and then by <a href="Robert%20Richards%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Robert Richards</a>, with the support of the opposition until the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201933">1933 state election</a>. At the 1933 election, Denny lost his seat to a <a href="Lang%20Labor%20Party%20%28South%20Australia%29">Lang Labor Party</a> candidate.

In September 1936, Bill's brother, the Catholic priest Reverend Denny, and his sister, Mary Catherine Denny, were involved in a vehicle accident in which Mary received fatal injuries. Reverend Denny suffered from an illness that resulted from the accident which contributed to his death in June 1941. Denny wrote a further autobiographical book, "A Digger at Home and Abroad", which was published in 1941. He continued to practice law until his death, despite difficulties associated with <a href="rheumatoid%20arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</a>. He died on 2 May 1946 of a heart attack which developed at his home on Osmond Terrace, Norwood, after he returned from his office in Adelaide. He was survived by his wife, one son and three daughters. He was accorded a <a href="state%20funeral">state funeral</a>, and was buried at <a href="West%20Terrace%20Cemetery">West Terrace Cemetery</a>.

Denny was the patron of the <a href="West%20Adelaide%20Football%20Club">West Adelaide Football Club</a> for 20 years ending in 1930. He enjoyed diving for <a href="crayfish">crayfish</a> under the rocks at the back of <a href="Rosetta%20Head">Rosetta Head</a> near <a href="Victor%20Harbor%2C%20South%20Australia">Victor Harbor</a> on <a href="Encounter%20Bay">Encounter Bay</a>, and was often accompanied by Ephriam "Brownie" Tripp, an <a href="Aboriginal%20Australians">Aboriginal</a> man from the <a href="Raukkan%2C%20South%20Australia">Point McLeay</a> Aboriginal Mission. According to his entry in the "<a href="Australian%20Dictionary%20of%20Biography">Australian Dictionary of Biography</a>", "his preferred reading was Shakespeare and the Bible and he quoted liberally from both. His integrity, versatility and wide knowledge were unquestioned, and he was proud of the democratic legislation he had sponsored."

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1887 play)

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a four-<a href="act%20%28drama%29">act</a> <a href="Play%20%28theatre%29">play</a> written by <a href="Thomas%20Russell%20Sullivan">Thomas Russell Sullivan</a> in collaboration with the actor <a href="Richard%20Mansfield">Richard Mansfield</a>. It is an adaptation of "<a href="Strange%20Case%20of%20Dr%20Jekyll%20and%20Mr%20Hyde">Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</a>", an 1886 <a href="novella">novella</a> by the Scottish author <a href="Robert%20Louis%20Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>. The story focuses on the respected London doctor <a href="Dr.%20Jekyll%20and%20Mr.%20Hyde%20%28character%29">Henry Jekyll</a> and his involvement with Edward Hyde, a loathsome criminal. After Hyde murders the father of Jekyll's fiancée, Jekyll's friends discover that he and Jekyll are the same person; Jekyll has developed a potion that allows him to transform himself into Hyde and back again. When he runs out of the potion, he is trapped as Hyde and commits suicide before he can be arrested.

After reading the novella, Mansfield was intrigued by the opportunity to play a <a href="dual%20role">dual role</a>. He secured the right to <a href="literary%20adaptation">adapt</a> the story for the stage in the United States and the United Kingdom, and asked Sullivan to write the adaptation. The play debuted in Boston in May 1887, and a revised version opened on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> in September of that year. Critics acclaimed Mansfield's performance as the dual character. The play was popular in New York and on tour, and Mansfield was invited to bring it to London. It opened there in August 1888, just before the first <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a> murders. Some press reports compared the murderer to the Jekyll-Hyde character, and Mansfield was suggested as a possible suspect. Despite significant press coverage, the London production was a financial failure. Mansfield's company continued to perform the play on tours of the U.S. until shortly before his death in 1907.

In writing the stage adaptation, Sullivan made several changes to the story; these included creating a fiancée for Jekyll and a stronger moral contrast between Jekyll and Hyde. The changes have been adopted by many subsequent adaptations, including several film versions of the story which were <a href="film%20adaptation">derived</a> from the play. The films included a <a href="Dr.%20Jekyll%20and%20Mr.%20Hyde%20%281912%20film%29">1912 adaptation</a> directed by <a href="Lucius%20Henderson">Lucius Henderson</a>, a <a href="Dr.%20Jekyll%20and%20Mr.%20Hyde%20%281920%20film%29">1920 adaptation</a> directed by <a href="John%20S.%20Robertson">John S. Robertson</a>, and a <a href="Dr.%20Jekyll%20and%20Mr.%20Hyde%20%281931%20film%29">1931 adaptation</a> directed by <a href="Rouben%20Mamoulian">Rouben Mamoulian</a>, which earned <a href="Fredric%20March">Fredric March</a> an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a>. A <a href="Dr.%20Jekyll%20and%20Mr.%20Hyde%20%281941%20film%29">1941 adaptation</a>, directed by <a href="Victor%20Fleming">Victor Fleming</a>, was a remake of the 1931 film.

In the first act, a group of friends (including Sir Danvers Carew's daughter Agnes, attorney Gabriel Utterson, and Dr. and Mrs. Lanyon) has met up at Sir Danvers' home. Dr. Lanyon brings word that Agnes' fiancé, Dr. Henry Jekyll, will be late to the gathering. He then repeats a second-hand story about a man named Hyde, who injured a child in a collision on the street. The story upsets Utterson because Jekyll recently made a new will that gives his estate to a mysterious friend named Edward Hyde. Jekyll arrives; Utterson confronts him about the will, but Jekyll refuses to consider changing it.

Jekyll tells Agnes that they should end their engagement because of sins he has committed, but will not explain. Agnes refuses to accept this, and tells Jekyll she loves him. He relents, saying that she will help him control himself, and leaves. Sir Danvers joins his daughter, and they talk about their time in <a href="Mangalore">Mangalore</a>, India. When Hyde suddenly enters, Sir Danvers tells Agnes to leave the room. The men argue, and Hyde strangles Sir Danvers.

In the second act, Hyde fears that he will be arrested for the murder. He gives his landlady, Rebecca, money to tell visitors that he is not home. Inspector Newcome from <a href="Scotland%20Yard">Scotland Yard</a> offers Rebecca more money to turn Hyde in, which she promises to do. Hyde flees to Jekyll's laboratory, where Utterson is waiting to confront the doctor about his will; he insults Utterson and leaves. Rebecca, who has followed Hyde, arrives and tells Utterson that Hyde murdered Sir Danvers. In the play's original version, the act ends with Jekyll returning to his laboratory. In later versions (revised after its premiere), the second act contains an additional scene in which Jekyll returns home; his friends think he is protecting Hyde. Agnes, who saw Hyde before her father was murdered, wants Jekyll to accompany her to provide the police with a description, and is distraught when he refuses.

In the third act, Jekyll's servant, Poole, gives Dr. Lanyon a powder and liquid with instructions from Jekyll to give them to a person who will request them. While he waits, Lanyon speaks with Newcome, Rebecca, Agnes and Mrs. Lanyon. After the others leave, Hyde arrives for the powder and liquid. After arguing with Lanyon, he mixes them into a potion and drinks it; he immediately transforms into Jekyll.

In the final act, Jekyll has begun to change into Hyde without using the potion. Although he still needs it to change back, he has exhausted his supply. Dr. Lanyon tries to help Jekyll re-create the formula, but they are unable to find an ingredient. Jekyll asks Lanyon to bring Agnes to him, but Jekyll turns into Hyde before Lanyon returns. Utterson and Newcome arrive to arrest Hyde; knowing he can no longer transform back into Jekyll, Hyde commits suicide by taking poison.

The play was produced at the <a href="Boston%20Museum%20%28theatre%29">Boston Museum</a>, Broadway's <a href="Madison%20Square%20Theatre">Madison Square Theatre</a> and the <a href="Lyceum%20Theatre%2C%20London">Lyceum Theatre</a> in London's <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> with the following casts:

The Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson wrote "Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde" in 1885 when he was living in <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>, on England's south coast. In January 1886 the novella was published in the United Kingdom by <a href="Longmans%2C%20Green%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Longmans, Green & Co.</a> and by <a href="Charles%20Scribner%27s%20Sons">Charles Scribner's Sons</a> in the United States, where it was frequently <a href="copyright%20infringement">pirated</a> because of the lack of <a href="Copyright%20law%20of%20the%20United%20States">copyright</a> protection in the U.S. for works originally published in the UK. In early 1887, actor Richard Mansfield read Stevenson's novella and immediately got the idea to adapt it for the stage. Mansfield was looking for material that would help him achieve a reputation as a serious actor in the U.S., where he lived, and in England, where he had spent most of his childhood. He had played dual roles as a father and son in a New York production of the <a href="operetta">operetta</a> "<a href="Rip%20Van%20Winkle%20%28operetta%29">Rip Van Winkle</a>", and saw another acting opportunity in playing Jekyll and Hyde.

Although U.S. copyright law would have allowed him to produce an unauthorized adaptation, Mansfield secured the American and British stage rights. Performing in Boston, he asked a local friend, Thomas Russell Sullivan, to write a script. Sullivan had previously only written in his spare time while working as a clerk for <a href="Lee%2C%20Higginson%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Lee, Higginson & Co.</a>, a Boston investment bank. Although he doubted that the novella would make a good play, he agreed to help Mansfield with the project, and they worked quickly to complete the adaptation before other, unauthorized versions could be staged.

After just two weeks of <a href="rehearsal">rehearsal</a>s, the play opened at the Boston Museum on May 9, 1887, as the first American adaptation of Stevenson's novella. On May 14, it closed for rewrites. The updated version, produced by <a href="Albert%20Marshman%20Palmer">A. M. Palmer</a>, opened at the Madison Square Theatre on Broadway on September 12 of that year. Sullivan invited Stevenson, who had moved to the U.S. that summer; Stevenson was ill, but his wife and mother attended and congratulated Sullivan on the play. The Madison Square production closed on October 1, when Mansfield took his company on a nationwide tour. The tour began at the <a href="Chestnut%20Street%20Theatre">Chestnut Street Theatre</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and visited over a dozen cities, including several returns to Boston and New York. It ended at the Madison Square Theatre, where "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" was performed for a final season matinee on June 29, 1888.

In March 1888, while Mansfield's company was touring, <a href="Daniel%20E.%20Bandmann">Daniel E. Bandmann</a> staged a competing production with <a href="Dr.%20Jekyll%20and%20Mr.%20Hyde%20%281888%20play%29">the same name</a> at <a href="Niblo%27s%20Garden">Niblo's Garden</a>. Bandmann's opening night (March 12) coincided with the <a href="Great%20Blizzard%20of%201888">Great Blizzard of 1888</a>, and only five theatergoers braved the storm. One of the attendees was Sullivan, who was checking his competition. Bandmann's production inspired a letter from Stevenson to the New York "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28New%20York%29">Sun</a>" saying that only the Mansfield version was authorized and paying him <a href="royalty%20payment">royalties</a>.

The English actor <a href="Henry%20Irving">Henry Irving</a> saw Mansfield's performance in New York and invited him to bring the play to London, where Irving managed the <a href="Lyceum%20Theatre%2C%20London">Lyceum Theatre</a> in the <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a>. Although the play was scheduled to premiere in September 1888, Mansfield discovered that Bandmann planned to open his competing version in August, and he rushed to recall his company from vacation.

Mansfield also worked with Irving and Stevenson's publisher, Longmans, to block Bandmann's production and those of other competitors. In the UK, unlike the U.S., the novella had copyright protection. Longmans brought legal actions against the unauthorized versions; its efforts blocked a William Howell Poole production from opening at the Theatre Royal in <a href="Croydon">Croydon</a> on July 26. That day, Fred Wright's Company B presented one performance of its adaptation at the Park Theatre in <a href="Merthyr%20Tydfil">Merthyr Tydfil</a> before it was also closed. Bandmann had the <a href="Opera%20Comique">Opera Comique</a> theater reserved from August 6, but hoped to open his production earlier. Irving blocked this by reserving the theater for Mansfield's rehearsals, and Mansfield's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" opened at the Lyceum on August 4. Bandmann went ahead with his August 6 opening, but after two performances the production was shut down because of legal action by Longmans.

Although Irving attended some of Mansfield's rehearsals, he did not remain in London for the opening. Mansfield worked with Irving's <a href="stage%20manager">stage manager</a>, H. J. Lovejoy, and "acting manager" <a href="Bram%20Stoker">Bram Stoker</a> (who would later write the horror novel "<a href="Dracula">Dracula</a>") to stage the production. He was dissatisfied with Lovejoy's stagehands and complained to a friend, the drama critic <a href="William%20Winter%20%28author%29">William Winter</a>, that they were "slow" and "argumentative". Since the Lyceum crew had staged many productions and had a good reputation, Winter thought it more likely that they disliked Mansfield. Regardless of the crew's motives, Mansfield became antagonistic towards Irving during his time there.

The Lyceum production of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" was scheduled to close on September 29, after which Mansfield intended to stage other plays. Initially, he followed this plan, introducing productions of "<a href="Lesbia%20%28play%29">Lesbia</a>" and "<a href="A%20Parisian%20Romance">A Parisian Romance</a>" at the beginning of October. However, Mansfield soon reintroduced "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" to his schedule and added performances between October 10 and October 20.

On August 7, 1888, three days after the Lyceum opening of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", <a href="Martha%20Tabram">Martha Tabram</a> was discovered stabbed to death in London's <a href="Whitechapel">Whitechapel</a> neighborhood. On August 31 <a href="Mary%20Ann%20Nichols">Mary Ann Nichols</a> was found, murdered and mutilated, in the same neighborhood. Press coverage linking these and other <a href="Whitechapel%20murders">Whitechapel murders</a> of women created a furor in London. The public and police suspected that some or all of the murders were committed by one person, who became known as <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a>. Some press reports compared the unidentified killer with the Jekyll and Hyde characters, suggesting that the Ripper led a respectable life during the day and became a murderer at night. On October 5, the <a href="City%20of%20London%20Police">City of London Police</a> received a letter suggesting that Mansfield should be considered a suspect. The letter writer, who had seen him perform as Jekyll and Hyde, thought that Mansfield could easily disguise himself and commit the murders undetected.

Mansfield attempted to defuse public concern by staging the London opening of the comedy "<a href="Prince%20Karl%20%28play%29">Prince Karl</a>" as a charity performance, despite Stoker's warning that critics would view it as an attempt to obtain favorable publicity for the production. Although some press reports suggested that Mansfield stopped performing "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" in London because of the murders, financial reasons are more likely. Despite widespread publicity due to the murders and Mansfield's disputes with Bandmann, attendance was mediocre, and the production was losing money. On December 1, Mansfield's tenancy at the Lyceum ended. He left London, taking his company on a tour of England. In December they performed "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" and other plays in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> and <a href="Derby">Derby</a>, then continued to other cities and performed other plays.

When Mansfield left the UK in June 1889, he was deeply in debt because of production losses there. His debts included £2,675 owed to Irving, which Mansfield did not want to pay because he felt that Irving had not supported him adequately at the Lyceum. Irving sued, winning the UK performance rights to "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", and Mansfield never performed in England again.

In the U.S., the play became part of the <a href="repertory">repertory</a> of Mansfield's company and was repeatedly performed during the 1890s and early 1900s. Mansfield continued in the title role, and Beatrice Cameron continued to play Jekyll's fiancée; the actors married in 1892. In later years he staged the play less often, after becoming fearful that something would go wrong during the transformation scenes. Mansfield's company last performed the play at the <a href="New%20Amsterdam%20Theatre">New Amsterdam Theatre</a> in New York on March 21, 1907. He fell ill soon afterward, and died on August 30 of that year.

The play was closely associated with Mansfield's performance; a 1916 retrospective on adaptations of Stevenson's works indicated that Sullivan's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" was no longer performed after Mansfield's death. Although Irving obtained the UK performance rights, he never staged the play. His son, <a href="Harry%20Brodribb%20Irving">Harry Brodribb Irving</a>, produced a new adaptation by <a href="J.%20Comyns%20Carr">J. Comyns Carr</a> in 1910. By that time, more than a dozen other stage adaptations had appeared; the most significant was an 1897 adaptation by Luella Forepaugh and George F. Fish, made available in 1904 for <a href="stock%20theater">stock theater</a> performances as "<a href="Dr.%20Jekyll%20and%20Mr.%20Hyde%2C%20Or%20a%20Mis-Spent%20Life">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Or a Mis-Spent Life</a>".

Although Mansfield's transformations between Jekyll and Hyde included <a href="stage%20lighting">lighting</a> changes and <a href="theatrical%20makeup">makeup</a> designed to appear different under colored filters, it was mainly accomplished by the actor's facial contortions and changes in posture and movement. As Hyde, Mansfield was hunched over with a grimacing face and claw-like hands; he spoke with a guttural voice and walked differently than he did as Jekyll. The effect was so dramatic that audiences and journalists speculated about how it was achieved. Theories included claims that Mansfield had an inflatable rubber prosthetic, that he applied chemicals, and that he had a mask hidden in a wig, which he pulled down to complete the change.

In contrast to the novella, in which the physical transformation of Jekyll into Hyde is revealed near the end, most dramatic adaptations show it early in the play, because the audience is familiar with the story. As one of its first adapters, Sullivan worked in an environment where the transformation would still shock the audience, and he held the <a href="reveal%20%28narrative%29">reveal</a> until the third act.

There were several differences between Sullivan's adaptation and Stevenson's novella. Stevenson used <a href="multiperspectivity">multiple narrators</a> and a <a href="nonlinear%20narrative">circular narrative</a> (allowing material presented at the end to explain material presented at the beginning), but Sullivan wrote a <a href="linear%20narrative">linear narrative</a> in chronological order. This linear approach and the onstage action conveyed a stronger impression of <a href="realism%20%28arts%29">realism</a>, eliminating uncertainties in Stevenson's narrative. Although making the story more straightforward and less ambiguous was not necessary for a theatrical adaptation, Sullivan's approach was typical of the era's stage <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a>s and made the material more acceptable to audiences. The stage presentation's realism also allowed Sullivan to drop the novella's scientific aspects. Although Stevenson used science to make the Jekyll-Hyde transformation plausible to readers, Sullivan could rely on the onstage transformation.

The playwright strengthened the contrast between Jekyll and Hyde compared to Stevenson's original; Sullivan's Hyde was more explicitly evil, and his Jekyll more conventional. In Stevenson's novella Jekyll is socially isolated and <a href="neuroticism">neurotic</a>, and his motives for experimenting with the potion are ambiguous. Sullivan's adaptation changed these elements of the character. His Jekyll is socially active and mentally healthy, and his motives for creating the potion are benign; Sullivan's Jekyll tells Lanyon that his discovery will "benefit the world". Later adaptations made further changes, representing Jekyll as noble, religious or involved in charitable work. Mansfield's portrayal of Jekyll is less stereotypically good than later versions, and he thought that making the characterizations too simplistic would hurt the play's dramatic quality.

Sullivan's version added women to the story; there were no significant female characters in Stevenson's original. The presence of women (especially Jekyll's fiancée, Agnes Carew) placed Jekyll in traditional social relationships, which made him seem more normal by contemporaneous standards. Hyde behaved lecherously towards Agnes and cruelly towards his landlady, and his <a href="misogyny">behavior towards women</a> in this and later adaptations led to new interpretations of the character. In Stevenson's novella and Sullivan's play, Hyde is said to have committed unspecified crimes. Interpreters began to identify the crimes as sexual, positing sexual repression as a factor in Hyde's characterization. However, Stevenson denied that this was his understanding of the character in his original story.

In some interpretations of the novella, the male characters represent <a href="patriarchal">patriarchal</a> society, with Hyde signifying its moral corruption. Other interpretations suggest that the lack of female companionship for the male characters indicates their <a href="latent%20homosexuality">latent homosexuality</a> and that Hyde is engaged in homosexual activity. These interpretations are harder to apply to the play because of Sullivan's addition of female characters and heterosexual relationships.

Reviewing the play's initial production at the Boston Museum, "<a href="The%20Boston%20Post">The Boston Post</a>" "warmly congratulated" Sullivan on his script and said that it overcame the difficulties of turning Stevenson's story into a drama with only a few flaws. Mansfield's performance was praised for drawing a clear distinction between Jekyll and Hyde, although the reviewer found his portrayal of Hyde better crafted than his portrayal of Jekyll. Audience reaction was enthusiastic, with long applause and several <a href="curtain%20call">curtain call</a>s for Mansfield. According to "<a href="The%20Cambridge%20Tribune">The Cambridge Tribune</a>", the audience reaction affirmed "that the play and its production were a work of genius".

The Broadway production also received positive reviews. When it opened at the Madison Square Theatre, a "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" reviewer complimented Mansfield for his acting and for overcoming the difficulty of presenting the story's <a href="allegory">allegorical</a> material onstage. According to a "<a href="New-York%20Tribune">New-York Daily Tribune</a>" reviewer, Mansfield gave excellent performances as Jekyll and Hyde despite a few technical production flaws. A "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" review praised Sullivan's adaptation, particularly his addition of a love interest for Jekyll, and complimented the performances of Mansfield, Cameron and Harkins.

The Lyceum production received mixed reviews, complimenting Mansfield's performance but criticizing the play as a whole. A "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">Sunday Times</a>" reviewer appreciated Mansfield's performance as Hyde and in the transformation scenes, but not as Jekyll, and called the overall play "dismal and wearisome in the extreme". According to a "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a>" review, Stevenson's story was unsuitable for drama and Sullivan had not adapted it well, but the performances of Mansfield and his company were praiseworthy. A review in "<a href="Saturday%20Review%20%28London%29">The Saturday Review</a>" criticized Sullivan's adaptation, saying that it presented only one aspect of the Jekyll character from Stevenson's story. The reviewer complimented Mansfield's acting, especially in the transformation scenes, but said that his performance could not salvage the play. A review in "The Theatre" said that the play itself was not good, but it was an effective showcase for Mansfield's performance.

"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" was a milestone in the careers of Sullivan and Mansfield. Sullivan left his banking job to become a full-time writer. He wrote three more plays (none successful), several novels, and a two-volume collection of short stories, many of which have <a href="Gothic%20fiction">Gothic</a> elements. Sullivan attempted one more stage collaboration with Mansfield, a drama about the <a href="Roman%20emperor">Roman emperor</a> <a href="Nero">Nero</a>, but they became estranged after its failure. For the actor, playing Jekyll and Hyde helped establish his reputation for dramatic roles; he had been known primarily for comedies. Mansfield continued to struggle financially (in part because of his elaborate, expensive productions) before he achieved financial stability in the mid-1890s with a string of successful tours and new productions.

As the most successful early adaptation of "Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde", Sullivan's play influenced subsequent versions. Later adaptations followed his simplification of the narrative, addition of women characters (especially a romance for Jekyll) and highlighting of the moral contrast between Jekyll and Hyde. Most versions retain the practice of having one actor play Jekyll and Hyde, with the transformation seen by the audience. Several early film versions relied more on Sullivan's play than Stevenson's novella.

The <a href="Thanhouser%20Company">Thanhouser Company</a> produced a <a href="Dr.%20Jekyll%20and%20Mr.%20Hyde%20%281912%20film%29">1912 film version</a>, directed by <a href="Lucius%20Henderson">Lucius Henderson</a> and starring <a href="James%20Cruze">James Cruze</a>. The <a href="Reel%23Motion%20picture%20terminology">one-reel film</a>, based on Sullivan's play, may be an exception to the custom of one actor playing Jekyll and Hyde. Although Cruze was credited with a dual role, <a href="Harry%20Benham">Harry Benham</a> (who played the father of Jekyll's fiancée), said in 1963 that he had played Hyde in some scenes.

In 1920, <a href="Famous%20Players-Lasky">Famous Players-Lasky</a> produced a <a href="Dr.%20Jekyll%20and%20Mr.%20Hyde%20%281920%20film%29">feature-length version</a> directed by <a href="John%20S.%20Robertson">John S. Robertson</a>. <a href="John%20Barrymore">John Barrymore</a> starred as Jekyll and Hyde, with <a href="Martha%20Mansfield">Martha Mansfield</a> as his fiancée. <a href="Clara%20Beranger">Clara Beranger</a>'s script followed Sullivan's play in having Jekyll engaged to Sir Carew's daughter, adding a relationship between Hyde and an Italian dancer (played by <a href="Nita%20Naldi">Nita Naldi</a>). The addition of a female companion for Hyde became a feature of many later adaptations.

The first sound film based on Sullivan's play was a <a href="Dr.%20Jekyll%20and%20Mr.%20Hyde%20%281931%20film%29">1931 version</a>, produced and directed by <a href="Rouben%20Mamoulian">Rouben Mamoulian</a> and distributed by <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>. The film's writers, <a href="Samuel%20Hoffenstein">Samuel Hoffenstein</a> and <a href="Percy%20Heath%20%28screenwriter%29">Percy Heath</a>, followed much of Sullivan's storyline, adding a female companion for Hyde similar to Robertson's 1920 version. Hoffenstein and Heath were nominated for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Adapted%20Screenplay">Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay</a>, and the cinematographer <a href="Karl%20Struss">Karl Struss</a> was nominated for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Cinematography">Academy Award for Best Cinematography</a>. <a href="Fredric%20March">Fredric March</a> won the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a> for his portrayal of Jekyll and Hyde.

<a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> released a <a href="Dr.%20Jekyll%20and%20Mr.%20Hyde%20%281941%20film%29">1941 film</a> which was a remake of Mamoulian's 1931 film. <a href="Victor%20Fleming">Victor Fleming</a> directed, and <a href="Spencer%20Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a> starred. This version was nominated for three Academy Awards: <a href="Joseph%20Ruttenberg">Joseph Ruttenberg</a> for <a href="Best%20Cinematography%2C%20Black-and-White">Best Cinematography, Black-and-White</a>; <a href="Harold%20F.%20Kress">Harold F. Kress</a> for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%20Editing">Best Film Editing</a>, and <a href="Franz%20Waxman">Franz Waxman</a> for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Score">Best Score of a Dramatic Picture</a>.

According to the film historian Denis Meikle, Robertson, Mamoulian, and Fleming's films followed a pattern set by Sullivan's play: making Hyde's evil sexual and the Jekyll-Hyde transformation central to the performance. Meikle viewed this as a deterioration of Stevenson's original narrative initiated by Sullivan. Later adaptations diverged from the model established by Sullivan and the early films; some returned to Stevenson's novella, and others spun new variations from aspects of earlier versions.

American Pharoah

American Pharoah (<a href="foal">foal</a>ed February 2, 2012) is an American <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> racehorse who won the <a href="Triple%20Crown%20of%20Thoroughbred%20Racing%20%28United%20States%29">American Triple Crown</a> and the <a href="Breeders%27%20Cup%20Classic">Breeders' Cup Classic</a> in 2015. He was the 12th Triple Crown winner in history, and in winning all four races, became the first horse to win the <a href="Grand%20Slam%20of%20Thoroughbred%20racing">Grand Slam of Thoroughbred racing</a>. He won the 2015 <a href="Eclipse%20Award%20for%20Horse%20of%20the%20Year">Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year</a> and 2015 Champion three-year-old. He was bred and owned throughout his racing career by <a href="Ahmed%20Zayat">Ahmed Zayat</a> of Zayat Stables, trained by <a href="Bob%20Baffert">Bob Baffert</a>, and ridden in most of his races by <a href="Victor%20Espinoza">Victor Espinoza</a>. He now stands <a href="stud%20farm">at stud</a> at <a href="Ashford%20Stud">Ashford Stud</a> in Kentucky.

After finishing fifth in his track debut as a two-year-old, American Pharoah won his next two races, the <a href="Graded%20stakes%20race">Grade I</a> <a href="Del%20Mar%20Futurity">Del Mar Futurity</a> and <a href="FrontRunner%20Stakes">FrontRunner Stakes</a>, each by several <a href="horse%20length">lengths</a>. An injury kept him out of the <a href="Breeders%27%20Cup%20Juvenile">Breeders' Cup Juvenile</a>, but the strength of his two wins nonetheless resulted in his being voted <a href="American%20Champion%20Two-Year-Old%20Male%20Horse">American Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse</a> at the 2014 <a href="Eclipse%20Award">Eclipse Award</a>s. Before the 2015 season began, Zayat had sold breeding rights to the colt to the Ashford Stud, a division of Ireland's Coolmore Stud. He retained control over the colt and his racing career, as well as an undisclosed dividend on <a href="stud%20fee">stud fee</a>s.

American Pharoah began the 2015 campaign with wins in the <a href="Rebel%20Stakes">Rebel Stakes</a> and <a href="Arkansas%20Derby">Arkansas Derby</a> and went on to win the <a href="2015%20Kentucky%20Derby">2015 Kentucky Derby</a> and <a href="2015%20Preakness%20Stakes">2015 Preakness Stakes</a>. He won the Triple Crown in a wire-to-wire victory at the <a href="2015%20Belmont%20Stakes">2015 Belmont Stakes</a>, becoming the first American Triple Crown winner since <a href="Affirmed">Affirmed</a> in 1978 and the 12th in history. His winning time was the second-fastest for a Triple Crown winner, and his closing quarter-mile time of 24.32 was faster than <a href="Secretariat%20%28horse%29">Secretariat</a>'s. He next shipped to <a href="Monmouth%20Park">Monmouth Park</a> and easily won the <a href="Haskell%20Invitational">Haskell Invitational</a> on August 2, prompting Baffert to say, "He just keeps bringing it; he's a great horse." Three weeks later, he finished a close second in a hard-fought <a href="Travers%20Stakes">Travers Stakes</a> at <a href="Saratoga%20Race%20Course">Saratoga Race Course</a> on August 29, 2015, snapping a winning streak of eight races. After a layoff of two months, he shipped to <a href="Keeneland">Keeneland</a> for the <a href="2015%20Breeders%27%20Cup">2015 Breeders' Cup</a> and ran in the <a href="Breeders%27%20Cup%20Classic">Breeders' Cup Classic</a>, where he challenged older horses for the first time and won by <a href="horse%20length">lengths</a>, breaking the track record. Pursuant to the agreement between Zayat and Ashford, American Pharoah was retired to stud at the conclusion of his 2015 racing year.

American Pharoah is a <a href="Bay%20%28horse%29">bay</a> colt with a <a href="horse%20markings%23facial%20markings">faint star</a> on his forehead and no other white <a href="Horse%20markings">markings</a>. He is from the second crop of foals sired by <a href="Pioneerof%20the%20Nile">the Nile</a>, who finished second in the <a href="2009%20Kentucky%20Derby">2009 Kentucky Derby</a>. The stallion's first crop included <a href="Holy%20Bull%20Stakes">Holy Bull Stakes</a> winner Cairo Prince, and Social Inclusion, who finished third in the <a href="2014%20Preakness%20Stakes">2014 Preakness Stakes</a>. American Pharoah's <a href="Mare">dam</a>, <a href="Littleprincessemma">Littleprincessemma</a>, was purchased by Zayat in 2007 for $250,000. She raced but did not win either of her two starts in 2008. American Pharoah was her second foal, following <a href="allowance%20race">allowance race</a> winner Xixixi. Since his birth, she had produced two more full siblings to American Pharoah: a <a href="filly">filly</a> born in 2014, and a <a href="colt%20%28horse%29">colt</a>, foaled in 2015 after she sold—in foal to the Nile—in November 2014 for $2.1 million.

American Pharoah was bred in Kentucky by his owner, <a href="Ahmed%20Zayat">Ahmed Zayat</a>, CEO of Zayat Stables, LLC, and was born at 11 p.m. on <a href="Groundhog%20Day">Groundhog Day</a>, February 2, 2012, at Tom VanMeter's Stockplace Farm in <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a>. When he was a few days old, he and Littleprincessemma went to nearby Pretty Run Farm, also owned by VanMeter, where they remained for a few months. Later, the <a href="mare">mare</a> and <a href="foal">foal</a> were moved to Vinery, another Lexington farm where the Nile was stabled. There, American Pharoah was <a href="weaned">weaned</a> at five months of age, and stood out from the other <a href="weanling">weanling</a>s due to his <a href="equine%20conformation">conformation</a> and good temperament.

In January 2013 as a <a href="yearling%20%28horse%29">yearling</a>, he went to <a href="Taylor%20Made%20Farm">Taylor Made Farm</a> near <a href="Nicholasville%2C%20Kentucky">Nicholasville, Kentucky</a>, and began to be prepared for possible sale. In August 2013, American Pharoah was consigned by the Taylor Made Sales Agency to the <a href="Fasig-Tipton">Fasig-Tipton</a> Saratoga Yearling sale. A few weeks before the auction, American Pharoah bumped his leg and had a small lump that was visible to potential buyers at the sale, which may have discouraged bidders. He was officially purchased for the posted minimum of $300,000 by Ingordo Bloodstock, acting as an agent for Zayat, who in effect bought back his own horse. Zayat had pledged that he would not sell the promising but untested colt for less than $1 million. Zayat similarly bought back the Nile, American Pharoah's sire, for $290,000 in a 2007 yearling auction.

"We felt that he had brilliance in him," said Zayat of American Pharoah, "his demeanor, his aura, his conformation, the way he moved." Following the auction, the horse first went to Florida and was started under saddle at the McKathan Brothers Training Center near <a href="Citra%2C%20Florida">Citra</a>, where trainer J.B. McKathan said, "He just did everything right." Once he was ready to begin race conditioning, he went into training with <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Racing%20and%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a> inductee <a href="Bob%20Baffert">Bob Baffert</a> in the spring of 2014.

He was described in 2014 as a <a href="ridgling">ridgling</a>, rather than a <a href="colt%20%28horse%29">colt</a>, meaning that he had an <a href="undescended%20testicle">undescended testicle</a>. The 2013 catalogue for his yearling Fasig-Tipton sale listed him as a "colt", and he was described that way again in 2015. Zayat maintained the "ridgling" designation was an error: "he was always a colt."

In 2015, Baffert noted American Pharoah's smooth and distinctively long stride: "I've never had a horse that moves or travels over the ground like he does." The horse also had a short tail during his two- and three-year-old seasons—it was apparently chewed off by another horse. It is theorized that Mr. Z, a fellow competitor and Zayat-bred colt, may have been the culprit; the pair were kept together in Florida as younger horses. Trainer Baffert had a more colorful theory: "I think he was in the pasture one day and there was a mountain lion chasing him—that was the closest he could get ..."

American Pharoah's gentle demeanor is also distinctive, in that he is fond of people and, particularly for a young racehorse, surprisingly calm around them. As Baffert explained, "Horses of his caliber are not that nice and sweet. They're just sort of tough. If I brought <a href="Bayern%20%28horse%29">Bayern</a> out here, you can't get near him, he's too aggressive. [American Pharoah]'s just so different than any horse I've ever had." He was not always so calm, described initially as "a little bit of a headcase," but Baffert explained that after his anxiety-ridden first race, people worked with him, schooling him in the track <a href="paddock">paddock</a> for about two weeks, when "all the sudden he got really sweet and really mellow."

American Pharoah's name is inspired by that of his sire, the Nile, and his dam's sire, Yankee Gentleman. The horse's name also acknowledges Zayat's own Egyptian-American background. The misspelling of "<a href="Pharaoh">Pharaoh</a>" is permanent, but inadvertent. Zayat originally claimed that the spelling was the result of an error by <a href="The%20Jockey%20Club">The Jockey Club</a>, but the organization's president stated, "The name request for the 2012 colt American Pharoah was submitted electronically on January 25, 2014, through The Jockey Club's interactive registration site. Since the name met all of the criteria for naming and was available, it was granted exactly as it was spelled on the digital name application." Zayat later retracted his statement.

Zayat's wife, Joanne, offered another explanation for the name's origins to a local news reporter just before the Preakness. Zayat's son, Justin, ran a contest on <a href="social%20media">social media</a> in which fans could submit names for the horse. The winning entry had "Pharaoh" misspelled, she said. "Justin cut and pasted the name from [the winner's] email, and sent it to the Jockey Club." Marsha Baumgartner of <a href="Barnett%2C%20Missouri">Barnett, Missouri</a>, who submitted the winning entry, told "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", "I don't want to assign blame," but "I looked up the spelling before I entered." Nonetheless, Baumgartner minimized the controversy, stating, "Horses can't spell, anyway." Ultimately, Justin Zayat accepted responsibility for the error, stating, "I didn't happen to realize at the time that it was misspelled wrong ... Most English teachers in the world now are unhappy with me, but I'll live with that."

Due to the winning record of American Pharoah, The Jockey Club has now reserved both spellings so another horse cannot be similarly named. The Triple Crown blanket awarded to American Pharoah after his Belmont win inadvertently used the correct spelling of "pharaoh", and hence misspelled his name.

American Pharoah made his track debut in a <a href="maiden%20race">maiden race</a> over six and a half <a href="furlong">furlong</a>s on the <a href="Polytrack">Polytrack</a> surface at <a href="Del%20Mar%20Racetrack">Del Mar Racetrack</a> on August 9. Ridden by <a href="Martin%20Garcia%20%28jockey%29">Martin Garcia</a>, he started as the <a href="Fractional%20odds">7–5</a> favorite against eight opponents. He became unsettled before the race and, after running in second place until the stretch, faded to finish fifth behind Om, Iron Fist, One Lucky Dane, and Calculator, more than nine <a href="horse%20length">lengths</a> behind the winner. He ran in a <a href="Blinkers%20%28horse%20tack%29">blinker hood</a>, which appeared to unnerve him, as did the commotion in the saddling <a href="paddock">paddock</a>. Baffert addressed his anxiety issues by removing the hood and stuffing cotton in the horse's ears for subsequent races.

Despite his defeat, American Pharoah was moved up to <a href="Graded%20stakes%20race">Grade I</a> class for the Del Mar Futurity over seven furlongs on September 3. He was ridden by Victor Espinoza for the first time and started as the 3.2–1 second favorite behind <a href="Best%20Pal%20Stakes">Best Pal Stakes</a> winner Skyway, with Calculator and Iron Fist also in the field. American Pharoah took the lead from the start and went clear in the straight to win by four and three quarter lengths from Calculator, with a gap of more than eight lengths back to Iron Fist in third. Commenting on the colt's improvement, Baffert said, "We took the blinkers off, put cotton in his ears and schooled him a lot. He trained well, we decided he was ready and we put him in there. Today, he behaved himself and showed what he could do. He did what we thought he'd do the first time."

On September 27, American Pharoah was made the 1–2 favorite for the Grade I FrontRunner Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at <a href="Santa%20Anita%20Park">Santa Anita Park</a>. As in his previous race, he was immediately sent to the front by Espinoza and stayed there, pulling away from his rivals in the straight to win by three and a quarter lengths over Calculator, with <a href="Texas%20Red%20%28horse%29">Texas Red</a> a length and a half away in third. After the race, Espinoza explained how the colt moved: "All the way he was on a high cruising speed. He has such a long stride. He moves really nice and is light on his feet." Baffert said, "I can't believe his demeanor, how he has changed since his first out. He's so professional. He's really mentally there."

American Pharoah was scheduled to run in the <a href="Breeders%27%20Cup%20Juvenile">Breeders' Cup Juvenile</a> at Santa Anita on November 1 but was <a href="Stakes%20race">scratched</a> from the race after sustaining a "deep bruise" to his left front foot in a workout on October 27. After this injury, he was fitted with a special <a href="horseshoe">horseshoe</a>. His <a href="farrier">farrier</a>, Wes Champagne, placed a thin sheet of aluminum alloy over a regular racing horseshoe and cut it to match the dimensions of the shoe, leaving the front two-thirds of the hoof sole exposed, but creating a solid plate across the back that covered part of American Pharoah's heels and part of his <a href="frog%20%28horse%29">frog</a>. Champagne varied the design slightly depending on the tracks and races American Pharoah would run, but used the same basic concept throughout the Triple Crown series.

Even though he did not run in the Breeders' Cup, for the 2014 <a href="Eclipse%20Awards">Eclipse Awards</a>, American Pharoah was voted <a href="American%20Champion%20Two-Year-Old%20Male%20Horse">American Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse</a>, beating Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner <a href="Texas%20Red%20%28horse%29">Texas Red</a> by 126 votes to 111.

Five and a half months after his last start, American Pharoah began his second season in the Grade II <a href="Rebel%20Stakes">Rebel Stakes</a> on a sloppy track at <a href="Oaklawn%20Park">Oaklawn Park</a> on March 14. He carried top weight of 119 pounds and started as the 2–5 favorite against six opponents, headed by the <a href="Todd%20Pletcher">Todd Pletcher</a>-trained Madefromlucky. The colt led from the start and drew away in the closing stages to win by six and a quarter lengths. Espinoza called the winner "an amazing horse", while Baffert was satisfied with the run, especially as the colt returned with a twisted <a href="horseshoe">shoe</a> which would have hampered his progress. Four weeks later at the same track, American Pharoah started as the odds-on favorite against seven opponents in the Grade I <a href="Arkansas%20Derby">Arkansas Derby</a>. After racing in second place behind outsider Bridget's Big Luvy, he took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and steadily increased his advantage to win by eight lengths from <a href="Southwest%20Stakes">Southwest Stakes</a> winner Far Right. Baffert noted, "He's matured substantially. He's a good horse and he keeps moving forward. I don't want to get ahead of myself, but <a href="Dortmund%20%28horse%29">Dortmund</a> is another one who we don't yet know how good he is. We've got a one-two punch and that's a good position to be in." After the race, Ron Moquett, the trainer of runner-up Far Right, described American Pharoah as "a superhorse".

On May 2, American Pharoah started as the 2.9–1 favorite in an eighteen-runner field for the <a href="2015%20Kentucky%20Derby">141st running of the Kentucky Derby</a> at <a href="Churchill%20Downs">Churchill Downs</a>. His opponents included Dortmund, winner of the <a href="Santa%20Anita%20Derby">Santa Anita Derby</a>; Carpe Diem, who won the <a href="Breeders%27%20Futurity%20Stakes">Breeders' Futurity Stakes</a> and <a href="Blue%20Grass%20Stakes">Blue Grass Stakes</a>; <a href="Firing%20Line%20%28horse%29">Firing Line</a>, winner of the <a href="Sunland%20Derby">Sunland Derby</a>; <a href="Wood%20Memorial">Wood Memorial</a> winner <a href="Frosted%20%28horse%29">Frosted</a>; <a href="Florida%20Derby">Florida Derby</a> winner Materiality; international entry Mubtaahij, who earned his way to Kentucky with a win in the <a href="UAE%20Derby">UAE Derby</a>; and Upstart, winner of the <a href="Holy%20Bull%20Stakes">Holy Bull Stakes</a>. The crowd surrounding the horse during the walk-over from the barns to the paddock upset American Pharoah, and several grooms were required to keep him under control. He continued to misbehave until he was loaded into the <a href="starting%20gate">starting gate</a>; his <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23C">connections</a> and supporters worried that he was using up energy he needed for the race.

Espinoza positioned the colt in third place early in the race as Dortmund took the lead, followed closely by Firing Line. The three remained ahead of the pack throughout the race, and broke clear of their rivals entering the straightaway with American Pharoah making a forward move on the outside. The favorite took the lead entering the final furlong and won by a length from Firing Line and Dortmund in 2:03.02, with Frosted finishing strongly in fourth. Espinoza, who won the race for the third time, said, "I feel like the luckiest Mexican on earth. He has been a special horse since the first time I rode him. He has a lot of talent and is an unbelievable horse. Turning for home I started riding a little bit harder. At the <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23P">eighth pole</a> I just couldn't put that other horse away, but he got it done." Espinoza's performance attracted some scrutiny as he appeared to have struck the winner 32 times with his whip during the race. In post-race analysis, one of the stewards at Churchill Downs said, "we watched [the race replay] many, many times prior to making it official, and that wasn't anything that got our attention." Baffert said, "He was hitting him on the saddle towel. He doesn't hit that hard." <a href="Gary%20Stevens%20%28jockey%29">Gary Stevens</a>, rider of second-place Firing Line, commented that he had used his whip heavily as well, stating that the race was "as tough a race as I've been in in 20 years the last eighth of a mile." "<a href="The%20Blood-Horse">The Blood-Horse</a>" writer <a href="Steve%20Haskin">Steve Haskin</a>, while condemning whip overuse in general, offered analysis that Espinoza "did a lot of waving with the whip" and may not have actually hit the horse as many times as it seemed. Reflecting on the race, Baffert said that the colt did not bring his "super A-game" to the Derby and that it was the first time American Pharoah had really been tested by other aggressive horses.

Two weeks after winning the Kentucky Derby, American Pharoah entered the second leg of the Triple Crown, the <a href="2015%20Preakness%20Stakes">2015 Preakness Stakes</a>, run over nine and a half furlongs at <a href="Pimlico%20Race%20Course">Pimlico Race Course</a>. Despite an unfavorable inside draw of the number one post position, he was installed as the morning line favorite ahead of Firing Line and Dortmund. No horse had won the Preakness starting from the rail since 1994. Immediately before post time, the weather changed to a heavy downpour with thunder. The last time the Preakness had been run on a sloppy track <a href="1983%20Preakness%20Stakes">was in 1983</a>, and American Pharoah was the only horse in the field to have previously faced similar conditions, having won the Rebel Stakes running in rain and mud.

American Pharoah had the lead within the first quarter-mile and was challenged by Mr. Z early on, but held the lead on the inside throughout the race. He was challenged by Dortmund and then Divining Rod, but American Pharoah broke from the pack in the homestretch and won by seven lengths, as Tale of Verve made a strong rally to overtake Divining Rod to place. Firing Line slipped badly at the start and was eased in the stretch. The winning time was 1:58.45. Espinoza did not use his whip at all in the Preakness, and stated, "I couldn't see how far I was in front because there was so much water in my eyes." The margin of victory was tied for the sixth-largest in Preakness history. The win by American Pharoah set up an attempt for the <a href="Triple%20Crown%20of%20Thoroughbred%20Racing%20%28United%20States%29">Triple Crown</a> for the second straight year. It was also the second straight year that Espinoza had won both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and the jockey's third time winning both races. For Baffert, it was the fourth time in 19 years that he won the first two Triple Crown races. Of the colt, Baffert said, "He brought his A-game today."

In the week following the Preakness, the Leverage Agency was named as the exclusive marketing, sponsorship, and licensing agents for the horse. The firm had performed similar duties for <a href="California%20Chrome">California Chrome</a>, the winner of the 2014 Derby and Preakness. The agency secured a deal with <a href="Monster%20Energy">Monster Energy</a> for an undisclosed sum, rumored to be the largest single-horse advertising sponsorship to date. The deal allowed the "Monster Girls" to be around the horse, and the product's logo to be used on the horse's <a href="horse%20blanket%23other%20designs">horse sheets</a>, on Espinoza's shirt collar, and on caps and other gear worn by people around the horse.

In the runup to the Belmont, Baffert chose to work the horse at Churchill Downs, and transport him late to <a href="Belmont%20Park">Belmont Park</a> without a timed workout at the New York track. While several prominent trainers questioned his decision, Baffert said it was more important to keep American Pharoah "happy" on a track he liked, having used a similar strategy with his 2001 Belmont Stakes winner, <a href="Point%20Given">Point Given</a>. Rival trainers <a href="Kiaran%20McLaughlin">Kiaran McLaughlin</a> and <a href="D.%20Wayne%20Lukas">D. Wayne Lukas</a> backed Baffert's strategy; the former said, "I don't think it matters for American Pharoah. He could probably run down a street over broken glass." Appearing unperturbed but curious about a small crowd of well-wishers, American Pharoah arrived at <a href="Long%20Island%20MacArthur%20Airport">Long Island MacArthur Airport</a> on June 2, having traveled from <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a>, on a customized <a href="Boeing%20727">Boeing 727</a> dubbed "Air Horse One".

Three days before the race, American Pharoah's connections drew the No. 5 <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23P">post position</a> for the horse. Pundits noted it was the same slot from which <a href="Seattle%20Slew">Seattle Slew</a> had won the 1977 Belmont and the Triple Crown, and that 14 other Belmont winners had started from the position. American Pharoah was the 3–5 <a href="morning%20line">morning line</a> favorite in an eight-horse field that included Tale of Verve, as well as five rivals from the Kentucky Derby who had skipped the Preakness, and one horse, Madefromlucky, who had not run either of the previous Triple Crown races, but, like <a href="Tonalist">Tonalist</a> the previous year, had instead won the <a href="Peter%20Pan%20Stakes">Peter Pan Stakes</a> at Belmont Park. American Pharoah had previously defeated every horse entered, but he was also the only horse to contest all three legs of the Triple Crown and had run four races in the preceding eight weeks.

American Pharoah won the Belmont Stakes on June 6, becoming the 12th <a href="Triple%20Crown%20of%20Thoroughbred%20Racing%20%28United%20States%29">Triple Crown</a> winner and the first since 1978, ending a "drought" of 37 years. The horse was leaning back in the <a href="starting%20gate">starting gate</a> when it opened and was a touch late at the start, but he soon pulled out to an early lead, which he maintained for a gate-to-wire win. He steadily increased his lead throughout the race. He was challenged by Materiality until the top of the stretch when Materiality faded, ultimately finishing last, and Frosted held second although starting to fade at the <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23P">sixteenth pole</a>. <a href="Keen%20Ice">Keen Ice</a> ran in the middle of the pack until a late rally brought him into third over Mubtaahij, who was fourth. American Pharoah crossed the finish line leading by <a href="horse%20length">lengths</a>, with a winning time of 2:26.65 for the race. His margin of victory was the fourth-largest ever for a Triple Crown winner at the Belmont.

Of the victory, Baffert said, "This little horse deserves it. There's something about this horse that he just brought it every time. He's a joy to be around." In a post-race interview, Zayat said that the colt's racing schedule for the remainder of the year would be decided by Baffert, and that the needs of the horse would come first. He also acknowledged the need for horse racing to have "stars" and for them to race as long as they could. Though American Pharoah's stud rights had been sold with plans to retire the horse at the end of 2015, Zayat expressed hope that the horse would continue racing as long as he was healthy and "has it in him". His winning time of 2:26.65 was the sixth-fastest in Belmont history, the second-fastest for a Triple Crown winner, and his closing quarter-mile was run in 24.32 seconds, which was over a half-second faster than Secretariat's final quarter-mile time of 25.00 when the 1973 winner set a world record and won by 31 lengths.

The following morning, the colt came out of the race tired but in good shape. When Baffert brought American Pharoah out of the Belmont Park barn, he invited the assembled media to come over and pet the horse. "I wanted to share him with everybody and show everybody how kind and sweet he is," said Baffert, while the group of about 30 people touched and even kissed the horse. The horse then posed quietly with Baffert and Espinoza to tape a segment for "<a href="Today%20%28U.S.%20TV%20program%29">The Today Show</a>", standing between the two men who were seated in folding director's chairs.

An estimated 22 million U.S. television viewers watched the live Belmont race broadcast. Of 94,237 winning $2 tickets sold at Belmont Park, each with a yield of $3.50 for American Pharoah's first-place finish, some 90,128 remained unredeemed several days after the race, most likely kept as race-day souvenirs or to be offered for sale at a premium by their purchasers.

Following the Belmont, he was returned to Churchill Downs to rest, beginning to jog on the track the following Friday. On June 13, the day of the <a href="Stephen%20Foster%20Handicap">Stephen Foster Handicap</a>, American Pharoah was paraded on the track between races. A crowd of 30,000 people showed up to see him as he was hand-walked for about 45 minutes in front of the grandstand and in the paddock. Zayat, Baffert and Espinoza were also given their permanent keepsake Kentucky Derby and Triple Crown trophies in a ceremony that evening. American Pharoah's popularity was so high that his win made the cover of "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>", he was photographed for "<a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">Vogue</a>", and during the <a href="NBA%20Playoffs">NBA Playoffs</a>, the coach of the <a href="Golden%20State%20Warriors">Golden State Warriors</a>, <a href="Steve%20Kerr">Steve Kerr</a>, suggested that American Pharoah was the only athlete better than <a href="LeBron%20James">LeBron James</a>.

American Pharoah's next race was the <a href="Haskell%20Invitational">Haskell Invitational</a>, held August 2 at <a href="Monmouth%20Park">Monmouth Park</a>, New Jersey. Zayat wanted the horse's first race back be an "easy" race against other 3-year-olds, he wanted to race the horse in Zayat's home state of New Jersey, and he wanted to race on a Sunday to avoid a clash with the <a href="Shabbat">Jewish Sabbath</a>. Zayat explained, "He can run anywhere ... as long as he's happy and healthy ... I told [Monmouth] ... 'I want to do it for the sport and not worry about the money and stuff." Nonetheless, Monmouth Park raised the <a href="Purse%20distribution">purse money</a> for the race from $1 million to $1.75 million. Zayat had previously won the Haskell with <a href="Paynter%20%28horse%29">Paynter</a> in 2012, and Baffert already held the record for the most Haskell wins, having seven previous victories. Over 60,000 people showed up at Monmouth Park, which featured the <a href="Bruce%20Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> song "<a href="Born%20to%20Run%20%28Bruce%20Springsteen%20song%29">Born to Run</a>" in the <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23P">post parade</a>. Viewed as being in even better physical condition than in the Belmont, American Pharoah took the lead in the far turn and easily opened up a five-length lead over the six other horses in the race before Espinoza eased him back as second-place finisher Keen Ice made a strong finishing push. He won the race by lengths with a time of 1:47.95 for the 9-<a href="furlong">furlong</a> distance. Espinoza quipped, "He was having fun, and so was I." Baffert said, "He just keeps bringing it; he's a great horse."

The colt's next start was in the August 29 Travers Stakes at <a href="Saratoga%20Race%20Course">Saratoga</a>. While Zayat wanted to enter the race, Baffert was reluctant. The race marked the second time in under a month that American Pharoah, training with Baffert in California, had flown across the country, raising concerns that the extensive air travel was taking a toll on the horse. The only previous Triple Crown winner to win the Travers was <a href="Whirlaway">Whirlaway</a> in 1941, and two others, <a href="Gallant%20Fox">Gallant Fox</a> and <a href="Affirmed">Affirmed</a>, had been defeated there, helping give the track its nickname "Graveyard of Champions". Baffert had one Travers win (in 2001 with <a href="Point%20Given">Point Given</a>) in five previous attempts. With American Pharoah training well, he stated, "I've been looking for an excuse not to come (to the Travers) and I can't find one." 

American Pharoah faced a field of 10 horses, most of whom, including Keen Ice, he had previously defeated. Espinoza had concerns at the starting gate when he noticed that his mount was already sweating, even though the weather was not particularly hot. While the horse led for much of the race, he was hard-pressed throughout by Frosted, a change from Frosted's previous stalking style, attributed to a rider change less than an hour before the race, when <a href="Jose%20Lezcano">Jose Lezcano</a> replaced an injured <a href="Joel%20Rosario">Joel Rosario</a>, altering the "complexion" of the race. The unexpected tactics of Lezcano may have been decisive. Espinoza stated that he "knew he was in trouble" by the half-mile pole because American Pharoah did not pull away from his rival and lacked his usual energy. Frosted challenged American Pharoah for the lead at the far turn, and the horses bumped several times, but American Pharoah dug in and fought back when Frosted took a very brief lead. While American Pharoah fended off the challenge from Frosted, Keen Ice was coming up on the outside, also under a new jockey, <a href="Javier%20Castellano">Javier Castellano</a>. They overtook American Pharoah at the sixteenth pole, going on to defeat him by three-quarters of a length. Once again the Saratoga track lived up to its reputation.

After the race, Espinoza said, "He's OK ... Maybe it was just a little too much for him those three weeks, flying back and forth. He was running pretty comfortable there, but not like he used to." Baffert was proud of the horse's fighting effort, stating "It was just guts." Though Zayat talked of retiring the horse, Baffert said, "We knew we were doing the impossible, shipping him back and forth." The following day, Baffert said that American Pharoah was healthy and came out of the race in good shape. He said he had no regrets, stating, "I'm glad I brought him. Racing needed something like this. He almost pulled it off." Regarding Zayat's talk of retiring the horse, Baffert said, "Mr. Zayat is a very emotional man. We were all pretty disappointed ... I know (Zayat) will be going back and forth ... He's a sportsman for bringing him up here." Five days later, Zayat announced that the horse would be kept in training with the goal to run in the Breeders' Cup Classic, stating, "I believe there were a combination of factors that prevented American Pharoah from running his absolute best ... I have every confidence that he can run to his best again, and he deserves the chance to do so."
On October 31, 2015, American Pharoah became the first horse in history to complete the "Grand Slam" of American horse racing—the Triple Crown plus the <a href="Breeders%27%20Cup%20Classic">Breeders' Cup Classic</a>—after winning the 2015 Classic at <a href="Keeneland">Keeneland</a>, setting a track record with a time of 2:00.07; 

American Pharoah finished 2015 having set a single season record for race earnings, winning $8,288,800. He broke the previous single season record of $7,563,535 set by <a href="Smarty%20Jones">Smarty Jones</a> in 2004, and that record had included a $5 million bonus that is no longer awarded. His lifetime career earnings were $8,650,300. His <a href="Racing%20Post%20Rating">Racing Post Rating</a> (RPR) of 138 was the highest of any American horse since the <a href="Racing%20Post">Racing Post</a> began the system in 1988, topping that of previous U.S. record-holders <a href="Ghostzapper">Ghostzapper</a> and <a href="Cigar%20%28horse%29">Cigar</a>. Only two horses worldwide had ever achieved higher ratings, <a href="Frankel%20%28horse%29">Frankel</a> at 143, and <a href="Dubai%20Millennium">Dubai Millennium</a>, with 139, both doing so as more mature four-year-olds. He was rated the number one horse in the world in 2015 by the <a href="World%27s%20Best%20Racehorse%20Rankings">World's Best Racehorse Rankings</a>.

At the conclusion of the season, American Pharoah's accomplishments were named the top sports story of the year by the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a>. He and his connections also swept most of the horse-racing world's year-end awards. At the 2015 <a href="Eclipse%20Award">Eclipse Award</a>s, he was the unanimous choice for <a href="American%20Horse%20of%20the%20Year">American Horse of the Year</a> and <a href="American%20Champion%20Three-Year-Old%20Male%20Horse">Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse</a>. His win marked only the second time that an American Horse of the Year had been unanimously selected, the first being <a href="John%20Henry%20%28horse%29">John Henry</a> in 1981. He was named the winner of the <a href="Secretariat%20Vox%20Populi%20Award">Secretariat Vox Populi Award</a>, and his Belmont win was declared the <a href="National%20Thoroughbred%20Racing%20Association%20Moment%20of%20the%20Year">NTRA Moment of the Year</a>. His connections were given the <a href="Big%20Sport%20of%20Turfdom%20Award">Big Sport of Turfdom Award</a>, an honor for people who "enhance coverage of Thoroughbred racing through cooperation with media and racing publicists." In addition, Baffert won the <a href="Eclipse%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Trainer">Eclipse Award for Outstanding Trainer</a> and Zayat Stables took home the Eclipse awards for <a href="Eclipse%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Owner">Outstanding Owner</a> and <a href="Eclipse%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Breeder">Outstanding Breeder</a>. Acknowledging owner Ahmed Zayat's record of philanthropy to Jewish causes, the "<a href="Jewish%20Daily%20Forward">Jewish Daily Forward</a>" in November 2015 named American Pharoah its "plus one" on its annual list of 50 most influential American Jews. The major award that the horse did not win was the <a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a> <a href="Sportsman%20of%20the%20Year">Sportsman of the Year</a>. In spite of being the public's overwhelming favorite, earning 47% of the vote out of eleven candidates in online voting, topping the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Royals">Kansas City Royals</a>, <a href="Usain%20Bolt">Usain Bolt</a>, and <a href="Novak%20Djokovic">Novak Djokovic</a>, the editors of the magazine gave the award to <a href="Serena%20Williams">Serena Williams</a>.

Midway through his award-winning season – on May 19, 2015 — Ahmed Zayat announced that he had sold American Pharoah's breeding rights to the Ashford Stud, a division of Ireland's <a href="Coolmore%20Stud">Coolmore Stud</a>, though he retained control over the colt and his racing career. Offers for the breeding rights had reportedly exceeded $20 million. After the Belmont, "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" magazine reported that Zayat had actually sold the breeding rights to Ashford in late 2014, long before he began his Triple Crown run, and that Zayat retained 100% of the racing rights. "Forbes" went on to estimate that if American Pharoah stood for a $100,000 <a href="stud%20fee">stud fee</a>, he could be worth $50 million. More conservative estimates placed his potential stud fee at $75,000 and his potential value at about $25 to $36 million. The "New York Times" said that breeding rights had been sold for $13.8 million: $9.8 million with an additional $4 million incentive if American Pharoah won the <a href="Belmont%20Stakes">Belmont Stakes</a>. Zayat retained an undisclosed percentage in the colt's breeding career, and explained that American Pharoah would retire from racing at the end of 2015.

American Pharoah shipped to Ashford Stud on November 2, 2015, where he was housed in the <a href="animal%20stall">stall</a> once occupied by <a href="Grand%20Slam%20%28horse%29">Grand Slam</a> and pastured each morning next to <a href="Thunder%20Gulch">Thunder Gulch</a>, a 23-year-old horse chosen for his calming influence on the young, energetic stallion. Ashford Stud set his initial stud fee for 2016 at $200,000, the second-highest stud fee in the United States, behind that of the $300,000 fee for <a href="Tapit">Tapit</a>. Sire the Nile's stud fee of $60,000 in 2015 was raised to $125,000 for 2016.

American Pharoah officially began breeding mares in February 2016, and was first bred to Untouched Talent, an 11-year-old <a href="mare">mare</a> owned by Coolmore, dam of Zayat's <a href="Bodemeister">Bodemeister</a>. Within the first two months of his breeding career, American Pharoah had about 80 mares in foal after about 100 breeding sessions. Notably, he has retained his kind disposition even as a breeding stallion.

On January 3, 2017, American Pharoah's first foal was born at Brookdale Farms. It was a bay <a href="colt%20%28horse%29">colt</a> with <a href="horse%20markings">four white socks and a blaze</a>, out of the four-year-old <a href="Tizway">Tizway</a> mare, Kakadu. The foal was described as having his sire's calm but bold personality. On January 15 at Coolmore Stud, Untouched Talent produced a <a href="filly">filly</a>, a bay with four white socks and a star. In March, Coolmore announced that the stallion would shuttle to stand at Coolmore Australia for the breeding season in the southern hemisphere, which begins in July, then return to America at the end of the year.

American Pharoah's first crop of foals were greeted with enthusiasm at the November 2017 <a href="Fasig-Tipton">Fasig-Tipton</a> and <a href="Keeneland%20Sales">Keeneland Sales</a>, including a <a href="weanling">weanling</a> filly who sold for $1 million. Bloodstock experts noted that he was "stamping" his get and the foals had inherited his efficiency of movement.

In 2016, <a href="Oaklawn%20Racing%20%26amp%3B%20Gaming">Oaklawn</a> president <a href="Charles%20J.%20Cella">Charles Cella</a> commissioned Philadelphia sculptor <a href="James%20Peniston">James Peniston</a> to create a life-sized bronze sculpture of American Pharoah and jockey Victor Espinoza. In preparation for sculpting, Peniston visited and photographed the horse with the permission of trainer Bob Baffert. The sculpture was cast in 2017 at Laran Bronze outside Philadelphia and installed on January 11, 2018, at the Oaklawn racetrack in <a href="Hot%20Springs%2C%20Arkansas">Hot Springs, Arkansas</a>. "James Peniston's full-scale, full-stride statue of American Pharoah [is] a perfect duplicate — down to its bulging muscles and veins — of the 3-year-old colt as he carried himself and jockey Victor Espinoza in the winter and spring of 2015 toward Triple Crown glory," the "<a href="Arkansas%20Democrat-Gazette">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</a>" wrote.

American Pharoah's pedigree includes horses adept at classic race distances on his sire's side and endowed with speed on his dam's side. Sire <a href="Pioneerof%20the%20Nile">the Nile</a> won the <a href="Santa%20Anita%20Derby">Santa Anita Derby</a> and ran second in the <a href="2009%20Kentucky%20Derby">2009 Kentucky Derby</a>, with all of his wins at distances of miles or more. Prior to American Pharoah, Pioneerof the Nile had sired five other winners of stakes races of a mile or more in his relatively new career as a stallion. Trainer Bob Baffert observed that Pioneerof the Nile also raced with "a big, long stride" and had "that same springing motion as American Pharoah, whose acceleration is pretty remarkable." He also praised Pioneerof the Nile's dam, Star of Goshen: "She was a freaky filly, really, really fast." To Baffert, American Pharoah's bloodline is a source of fascination: "Every time I work him, I go back and look at the pedigree, and I go, What is going on here?"

Pioneerof the Nile's sire is <a href="Empire%20Maker">Empire Maker</a>, who won the 2003 <a href="Belmont%20Stakes">Belmont Stakes</a>. This makes American Pharoah a great-grandson of <a href="Unbridled">Unbridled</a>, who won the <a href="1990%20Kentucky%20Derby">1990 Kentucky Derby</a> and the <a href="Breeders%27%20Cup%20Classic">Breeders' Cup Classic</a>. He carries lines to Grade I champions <a href="Toussaud">Toussaud</a> and <a href="Fappiano">Fappiano</a>, and to the top-rated European two- and three-year-old colt of 1983 and 1984, <a href="El%20Gran%20Senor">El Gran Senor</a>. He is also descended from <a href="Northern%20Dancer">Northern Dancer</a>, <a href="Buckpasser">Buckpasser</a>, and <a href="Mr.%20Prospector">Mr. Prospector</a>—whose descendants have won 43 Triple Crown races, all via Empire Maker. Ultimately, via Unbridled and his ancestors, American Pharoah's <a href="Y-DNA">sire line</a> traces to the <a href="Darley%20Arabian">Darley Arabian</a>.

Although Littleprincessemma, American Pharoah's dam, is the half-sister to graded stakes winner Storm Wolf, and to Misty Rosette, winner of the <a href="Old%20Hat%20Stakes">Old Hat Stakes</a> in 2006, her own undistinguished racing career, combined with the modest record of her sire, Yankee Gentleman, dampened initial public expectations for her second-born foal. Yet American Pharoah's maternal bloodline includes <a href="Storm%20Cat">Storm Cat</a>, a Grade I winner retired early due to injury, <a href="Northern%20Dancer">Northern Dancer</a>, a Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner, and <a href="Terlingua%20%28horse%29">Terlingua</a>, a celebrated broodmare, through whom he is a fifth-generation descendant of <a href="Secretariat%20%28horse%29">Secretariat</a>. He is also descended through his dam from <a href="Flying%20Paster">Flying Paster</a>, a Grade I champion who was 1978 <a href="California%20Horse%20of%20the%20Year">California Horse of the Year</a>, and <a href="Exclusive%20Native">Exclusive Native</a> (sire of <a href="Affirmed">Affirmed</a> and <a href="Genuine%20Risk">Genuine Risk</a>). Through both sire and dam, American Pharoah is a fifth- and sixth-generation descendant of <a href="Bold%20Ruler">Bold Ruler</a>, as well as a sixth- and seventh-generation descendant of <a href="Tom%20Fool">Tom Fool</a>, one of the top thoroughbreds of the last century. His <a href="mtDNA">tail-female line</a> traces back to The Oldfield Mare, foaled circa 1695.

Figuring prominently and repeatedly in American Pharoah's deep lineage is an earlier generation of champions, including <a href="Nasrullah%20%28horse%29">Nasrullah</a>, <a href="Native%20Dancer">Native Dancer</a>, <a href="Nearco">Nearco</a>, <a href="Princequillo">Princequillo</a>, <a href="War%20Admiral">War Admiral</a> and <a href="Man%20o%27%20War">Man o' War</a>.

Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar

The Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar or Cincinnati Music Center half dollar is <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">a commemorative</a> <a href="Half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">50-cent piece</a> struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> in 1936. Produced with the stated purpose of commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> as a center of music, it was conceived by <a href="Thomas%20G.%20Melish">Thomas G. Melish</a>, a coin enthusiast who controlled the group which was allowed to buy the entire issue from the government, and who resold the pieces at high prices.

<a href="74th%20United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> approved legislation for the coin on March 31, 1936, authorizing 15,000 pieces to be struck at the three mints then in operation. Melish had hired sculptor <a href="Constance%20Ortmayer">Constance Ortmayer</a> to design the coin, but the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a> refused to recommend the designs. Members objected to the depiction of <a href="Stephen%20Foster">Stephen Foster</a> on the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a>, finding no connection between Foster, who died in 1864, and the supposed anniversary. Nevertheless, the designs were approved by the Bureau of the Mint, and 5,000 sets from the three mints were issued and sold to Melish's group, the only authorized purchaser.

Melish likely held back much of the issue for later resale, and with few pieces available, prices for the set spiked, rising to over five times the issue price. The value dropped somewhat when the boom in commemorative coins burst in late 1936, but quickly recovered and the coins are valuable today. Melish has been assailed by <a href="numismatics">numismatic</a> writers for greed.

Sparked by low-mintage issues which appreciated in value, the market for <a href="United%20States%20commemorative%20coin">United States commemorative coin</a>s spiked in 1936. Until 1954, the entire mintage of such issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market, and in early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the <a href="coin%20collecting">coin collecting</a> hobby, where they sought to purchase the new issues. Among the pieces which had recently been struck and had appreciated in value was the 1935 <a href="Old%20Spanish%20Trail%20half%20dollar">Old Spanish Trail half dollar</a>. This piece had been issued at the behest of L. W. Hoffecker, a Texas entrepreneur and coin dealer, who put aside a fifth of the 10,000 mintage for himself and sold them well into the 1940s, by which time he had served as president of the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a> (ANA). Congress authorized an explosion of commemorative coins in 1936; no fewer than fifteen were issued for the first time. At the request of the groups authorized to purchase them, several coins minted in prior years were produced again, dated 1936, senior among them the <a href="Oregon%20Trail%20Memorial%20half%20dollar">Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar</a>, first struck in 1926.
<a href="Thomas%20G.%20Melish">Thomas G. Melish</a>, a coin collector and entrepreneur from Cincinnati, came up with an idea for a commemorative coin that he would control and from which he could profit. Melish was a prominent businessman who had inherited the Bromwell Wire Company. He formed the Cincinnati Musical Center Commemorative Coin Association, and secured the introduction of H.R. 10264 on January 31, 1936. This bill would have provided for 10,000 coins from the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>, 2,000 coins from <a href="Denver%20Mint">Denver</a>, and 3,000 from the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a>. Such a low mintage would have made the Denver coin a significant rarity, increasing Melish's profit. On February 17, the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Coinage%2C%20Weights%20and%20Measures">House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures</a> recommended that it be amended to provide for a total of 15,000 coins without dictating at what mint or mints they should be struck. That committee, in its report accompanying the bill, noted that the piece was "in commemoration of the fiftieth (golden) anniversary of Cincinnati, Ohio, as a center of music, and its contribution of the annual <a href="Cincinnati%20May%20Festival">May festival</a> to the art of music for the past 50 years." Melish, through political influence, was able to retain the provision that they should be struck "at the mints", allowing coinage at all three mints. This marked the last time that a coinage bill would pass Congress in the 1930s with that phrasing—later issues were limited to a single mint.

The bill passed Congress, and was signed by President <a href="Franklin%20Roosevelt">Franklin Roosevelt</a> on March 31, 1936. The pieces were to honor "the 50th anniversary of Cincinnati, Ohio, as a center of music, and its contribution to the art of music for the past 50 years". Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, in their volume on commemorative coins, concluded that "pressure from the above-named Association on Congress induced passage of the Act".

Melish engaged <a href="Constance%20Ortmayer">Constance Ortmayer</a> to design the coin. Ortmayer later remembered, "I was recommended by them, someone came through Cincinnati ... they were just looking for somebody so they recommended me". Ortmayer apparently prepared a design before the bill passed Congress, for Melish wrote to Assistant <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Director of the Mint</a> <a href="Mary%20Margaret%20O%27Reilly">Mary Margaret O'Reilly</a> on April 4, 1936, that the original "lacked distinction and artistic merit" and that Ortmayer would redesign the coin. He wrote again on May 7, asking if Ortmayer's new design was satisfactory. The models were submitted to the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>, charged since 1921 with advising on coin design, though the government was not bound to follow its recommendations. On May 13, the chairman, Charles Moore, wrote to Mint Director <a href="Nellie%20Tayloe%20Ross">Nellie Tayloe Ross</a>, withholding approval.
Moore recited the stated purpose of the coin, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cincinnati as a center of music, then noted that the obverse depicted <a href="Stephen%20Foster">Stephen Foster</a>, the composer and songwriter—who died in 1864, whereas Cincinnati was not notable as a center of music until at least 1873. "The Commission is at a loss to connect a fiftieth anniversary in 1936 with a movement that began in 1873." Foster did live in Cincinnati, Moore admitted, but only for a brief period while working as a bookkeeper, and his main contributions to American music came later, when he lived in Pittsburgh and in New York City. Further, the coin was to commemorate Cincinnati's contributions to the art of music, and Foster "was an American <a href="troubadour">troubadour</a>, but to music as an art he made no contribution". Moore felt that if anyone should be depicted, it should be <a href="Theodore%20Thomas%20%28conductor%29">Theodore Thomas</a>, who conducted the <a href="Cincinnati%20May%20Festival">Cincinnati May Festival</a> from its beginning in 1873 and in 1878 became director of the Cincinnati College of Music. He stated that "Theodore Thomas was, artistically, the founder of Cincinnati as a musical center. His portrait should appear on any coin commemorative of Cincinnati 'as a center of music'".

On May 16, "<a href="The%20Cincinnati%20Enquirer">The Cincinnati Enquirer</a>" reported that Thomas would appear on the coin, not Foster. The paper also reported the controversy before the Commission of Fine Arts, that Melish had travelled to Washington the previous day, and had announced he had no objection to the change. Also on May 16, Melish telephoned <a href="Lee%20Lawrie">Lee Lawrie</a>, sculptor member of the Commission. Melish's notes indicate that Moore's objection was on behalf of <a href="Alice%20Roosevelt%20Longworth">Alice Roosevelt Longworth</a> and the Longworth family, who had employed Thomas to lead the May Festival, and who wanted Thomas on the coin, although, as (per Melish) Lawrie put it, "Thomas looks like a walrus and would be a very hard head to make". Melish was defiant, stating that he also knew Alice Longworth well, and Foster remained on the coin. Ortmayer remembered that the "boss" of the Bureau of the Mint (presumably Ross) objected to the reverse design, not liking the position of the goddess' legs. Swiatek, in his later volume, averred that Melish's association put pressure on the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">Department of the Treasury</a> to approve Ortmayer's design.

The Philadelphia Mint received the models from Ortmayer. On May 23 its superintendent, Edwin Dressel, sent O'Reilly a memorandum from Chief Engraver <a href="John%20R.%20Sinnock">John R. Sinnock</a>, stating that the sculptor's models were in too high <a href="relief%20%28art%29">relief</a>, and suggesting that Ortmayer come to the mint to discuss the matter. A letter from O'Reilly to Melish on June 18 reports that after some modification, Sinnock wrote that the coin was at the very limit of high relief that the mint could coin, and that dies for the Cincinnati piece were expected to be tested by coining trial strikes in early July.

The <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> of the Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar displays a bust of Stephen Foster, facing to the viewer's right, and below it, the words "". This phrase was taken from a biography of Foster published earlier in the 1930s. The artist's initials, "CO", are to the left of Foster. The name of the country, and the denomination, appear near the rim. The reverse shows a kneeling figure, intended to be the goddess of music. In the upper left portion of the field, or background, is the date 1886, in the lower right 1936, and beneath the latter the <a href="mint%20mark">mint mark</a> (unless struck at Philadelphia, which did not then use one). The goddess kneels on the mottos required by law to appear, and near the edge is "".

The design attracted comments from those interested in coins. Frank Duffield, editor of the ANA's journal "<a href="The%20Numismatist">The Numismatist</a>", noted in the October 1936 issue that the coin had been awaited with anticipation by hobbyists because of an announcement that it would bear the likeness of Foster, but "when it finally appeared many expressions of approval of the designs were heard and a few criticisms ... Foster deserved a better bust than the one the artist has given us ...the toy four-string lyre [the goddess] holds in her hand is not in keeping with the times or the occasion ... After all these years, Music deserved something better." Coin dealer B. Max Mehl, in his monograph on commemorative coins published in 1937, agreed with the criticism of the reverse, "apparently this lyre must have been bought at a 5¢ and 10¢ store as it seems to be only a toy".

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, in his 1971 volume on American coins and medals, "Numismatic Art in America", criticized Ortmayer's design:

The mintage of 15,000 was struck in July 1936. At the Philadelphia and Denver mints, 5,005 pieces were produced, and 5,006 at San Francisco, with the excess from the even thousands held for inspection and testing at the 1937 meeting of the <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">United States Assay Commission</a>. The first 200 pieces from each mint were collected in sets of three, with a notarized letter from Melish testifying to what number coins they were. Several of these special sets were sent by Melish to government officials.
Melish had been fielding inquiries from collectors since Roosevelt signed the legislation, but from mid-May, those who wrote received only postcards stating the new issue was oversubscribed. The summer of 1936 was the peak of the commemorative coin boom, and Melish announced the new pieces would be sold in sets of three by mint mark for $7.75 (a high price at that time). Order blanks were sent to those who had written early, and soon these blanks were selling for $10. Yet few collectors were successful in having their orders filled, with most having their payment returned as the coins had supposedly sold out. The sets quickly jumped in price to $40. At this high level, many coins proved available. Numismatist <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> stated that these were most likely surreptitiously sold by Melish and other insiders. Melish also allowed the issuers of the <a href="York%20County%2C%20Maine%20Tercentenary%20half%20dollar">York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar</a> to purchase, at the original issue price, several sets—members of the public could order at most one set at that price. In return, he sought to purchase that and other commemorative coins in quantities beyond the usual order limit. Nevertheless, when the <a href="Oregon%20Trail%20Memorial%20Association">Oregon Trail Memorial Association</a>, issuer of the long-lived half dollar honoring the trail, tried to purchase a set, Melish replied that they were sold out.

By December, the bottom had dropped out of the commemorative coin market, and dealers who had purchased quantities found themselves unable to dispose of them at a profit. By 1940 the coin sets were selling for $15 per set. They thereafter recovered, and by the early 1960s had reached $100 a set, and by 1975 $550 per set of three. At the height of the second commemorative coin boom in 1980, they sold for $2,250 a set. <a href="R.S.%20Yeoman">R.S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>", published in 2015, lists the sets at between $875 and $2,700 depending on condition. Individual coins are cataloged at about a third of the set prices.
The circumstances of the issuance were not clear at first: Mehl wrote that the coin was to honor the 50th anniversary of the "Cincinnati Musical Center" which was "founded in 1886" and that "either through good distribution or a great demand, the sets did not go around to all those who wanted them". Later numismatic writers have been harsh to Melish; Swiatek deemed the coin issued because of "false claims" on its behalf. Kevin Flynn, in his volume on commemoratives, stated that the Cincinnati piece "was made for pure profit and greed". Swiatek and Breen, in their 1988 book, suggest that Melish's group "had only one idea in mind: enriching themselves by publicizing and distributing a limited issue which could be priced into orbit by speculators".

With the success of the issue, Melish tried to get Congress to authorize 1937-dated pieces; he was not successful. He had managed to get Congress to allow another commemorative under his control, the 1936 <a href="Cleveland%20Centennial%20half%20dollar">Cleveland Centennial half dollar</a>. In 1942, when the ANA held its annual convention in Cincinnati, Melish hosted a hospitality suite. Dubbed the "Pirate's Den", it featured paintings he had commissioned, depicting coin dealers and other numismatic personalities in <a href="Pirates%20in%20popular%20culture">piratical</a> clothes. According to Bowers, "Overlooked was the fact that the greatest pirate of all was surely Melish himself, who undoubtedly treated many of his guests with money taken from them a few years earlier in the sale of Cincinnati sets!"

1937 Fox vault fire

On July 9, 1937, a major fire broke out in a <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a> film storage facility in <a href="Little%20Ferry%2C%20New%20Jersey">Little Ferry, New Jersey</a>, United States. Flammable <a href="nitrate%20film">nitrate film</a> had previously contributed to several high-profile fires in film industry laboratories, studios, and vaults, although the precise causes were often unknown. In Little Ferry, gases produced by decaying film, combined with high temperatures and inadequate ventilation, resulted in <a href="spontaneous%20combustion">spontaneous combustion</a>.

One death and two injuries resulted from the fire, which also destroyed all of the archived film in the vaults, resulting in the complete <a href="lost%20film">loss</a> of most of the <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a>s produced by <a href="Fox%20Film%20Corporation">Fox Film Corporation</a> before 1932. Also destroyed were <a href="Educational%20Pictures">Educational Pictures</a> <a href="negative%20%28film%29">negatives</a> and films of several other <a href="film%20studio">studios</a>. The fire brought attention to the potential for decaying nitrate film to spontaneously ignite, and changed the focus of <a href="film%20preservation">film preservation</a> efforts to include a greater focus on fire safety. Production and use of nitrate film was gradually phased out in favor of safer alternatives.

The early motion-picture industry primarily used <a href="nitrocellulose">nitrocellulose</a> <a href="film%20stock">film stock</a>, commonly called nitrate film. This film is flammable, and produces its own oxygen supply as it burns. Nitrate fires burn rapidly and cannot typically be extinguished, as they are capable of burning even under water. Nitrocellulose is also subject to <a href="thermal%20decomposition">thermal decomposition</a> and <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a>, <a href="polymer%20degradation">breaking down</a> over time in the presence of high temperatures and moisture. This decaying film stock releases <a href="nitrogen%20oxide">nitrogen oxide</a>s that themselves <a href="autocatalysis">contribute</a> to the decay and make the damaged film burn more easily. Under the right conditions, nitrate film can even <a href="spontaneous%20combustion">spontaneously combust</a>. In part because of substantial variability in the manufacturing of early film, considerable uncertainty exists about the circumstances necessary for self-ignition. Sustained temperatures of or higher, large quantities of nitrate film, increased humidity, poor ventilation, and aged or decaying film have all been considered risk factors. Most such fires in film archives have taken place in <a href="heat%20wave">heat wave</a>s during summer months, in closed facilities with limited ventilation, compounding several of these variables. Especially in confined areas, such fires can result in explosions.

Large and dangerous fires sometimes resulted. On May 4, 1897, one of the first major fires involving nitrate film began when a <a href="Auguste%20and%20Louis%20Lumi%C3%A8re">Lumière</a> projector caught fire at the <a href="Bazar%20de%20la%20Charit%C3%A9">Bazar de la Charité</a> in Paris. The <a href="Bazar%20de%20la%20Charit%C3%A9%23Fire_of_1897">resulting blaze</a> caused 126 deaths. In the United States, a series of fires occurred at industry facilities. The <a href="Lubin%20Manufacturing%20Company">Lubin Manufacturing Company</a>'s vault in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> exploded on June 13, 1914, followed on December 9 by a fire that destroyed <a href="Thomas%20Edison">Thomas Edison</a>'s laboratory complex in <a href="West%20Orange%2C%20New%20Jersey">West Orange, New Jersey</a>. The New York studio of the <a href="Famous%20Players%20Film%20Company">Famous Players Film Company</a> burned in September 1915; in July 1920, the shipping facility of its corporate successor, <a href="Famous%20Players-Lasky">Famous Players-Lasky</a>, was destroyed by a fire in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, despite construction intended to minimize that risk. The United Film Ad Service vault, also in Kansas City, burned on August 4, 1928, and a fire was reported at <a href="Path%C3%A9%20Exchange">Pathé Exchange</a> nine days later. In October 1929, the <a href="Consolidated%20Film%20Industries">Consolidated Film Industries</a> facility was badly damaged by a nitrate fire. Spontaneous combustion was not proven to have occurred in any of these fires, and may not have been recognized as possible before a 1933 study determined that the temperatures necessary for nitrate film to self-ignite had been significantly overestimated.

When <a href="Little%20Ferry%2C%20New%20Jersey">Little Ferry, New Jersey</a>, contractor William Fehrs was hired to construct a film storage facility in 1934, he designed the structure to be fireproof. The building had brick outer walls and a <a href="reinforced%20concrete">reinforced concrete</a> roof. Internally, it was divided into 42 individual vaults, each enclosed behind a steel door and separated by brick interior walls. The local fire department confirmed Fehrs's fireproofing. However, it was equipped with neither a <a href="fire%20sprinkler%20system">fire sprinkler system</a> nor <a href="ventilation%20%28architecture%29">mechanical ventilation</a>, and no <a href="security%20guard">security guard</a> was employed to watch the facility. Despite the potential fire danger of stored film, the building was located in a residential neighborhood.

<a href="Film%20processing">Film processing</a> company <a href="DeLuxe%20Laboratories">DeLuxe Laboratories</a> owned the building, and rented it to <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a> to store the <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a>s acquired from <a href="Fox%20Film%20Corporation">Fox Film Corporation</a> after its merger with <a href="Twentieth%20Century%20Pictures">Twentieth Century Pictures</a>.

Northern New Jersey experienced a heat wave in July 1937, with daytime temperatures of and warm nights. The sustained heat contributed to nitrate decomposition in the film vaults, and the building's ventilation was inadequate to prevent a dangerous buildup of gases. At some time shortly after on July 9, spontaneous ignition occurred in the vault at the building's northwest corner. Local truck driver Robert Davison observed flames coming from one of the structure's window vents, and within five minutes, used a municipal <a href="fire%20alarm%20call%20box">fire alarm call box</a> to report the fire.

Davison then attempted to awaken the residents of the surrounding houses, many of whom were already alerted to the situation by the noise and intense heat. As decomposition gases in additional vaults ignited, bursts of fire shot over horizontally across the ground from the windows, and a similar distance into the air from the building's roof vents. The vaults in the south and east of the building contained a higher concentration of flammable gas. When the fire spread to them, they exploded, damaging the brickwork and blowing out window frames. Anna Greeves and her two sons, John and Charles, were caught in a "sheet of flame" while attempting to flee the area. All three were seriously burned; 13-year-old Charles eventually died from his injuries on July 19. Other families were able to escape unharmed as the fire spread to five neighboring residences and destroyed two vehicles. 

Little Ferry firefighters first arrived at , followed by companies from <a href="Hawthorne%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hawthorne</a>, <a href="Ridgefield%20Park%2C%20New%20Jersey">Ridgefield Park</a>, <a href="River%20Edge%2C%20New%20Jersey">River Edge</a>, and <a href="South%20Hackensack%2C%20New%20Jersey">South Hackensack</a>. Despite 150 men employing 14 <a href="fire%20hose">hose streams</a>, the fire was not extinguished until . All of the film in the facility was destroyed; more than 40,000 reels of <a href="negative%20%28film%29">negatives</a> and <a href="film%20print">prints</a> burned to ashes inside their <a href="film%20can">film can</a>s. The building was also badly damaged. Exploding vaults had destroyed segments of both the exterior walls and interior partitions and had deformed the structure's concrete roof. Total property damage was estimated at $150,000–200,000. Fifty-seven truckloads of burned film were hauled from the site to have their silver content extracted. Each can contained about five cents' worth of silver; the salvaged metal returned $2,000.

Although 20th Century Fox officials at the time remarked that "only old films" were destroyed, the 1937 Fox vault fire is now understood as a significant loss of American film heritage. Film historian <a href="Anthony%20Slide">Anthony Slide</a> called the destruction of the Fox vault "the most tragic" American nitrate fire. The highest-quality examples of every Fox film produced prior to 1932 were destroyed; all known copies of many films had been stored in the facility. Films lost to the fire include pictures starring <a href="Theda%20Bara">Theda Bara</a>, <a href="Shirley%20Mason%20%28actress%29">Shirley Mason</a>, <a href="William%20Farnum">William Farnum</a>, and many others. <a href="Tom%20Mix">Tom Mix</a> made eighty-five pictures with Fox, most of which were archived exclusively at Little Ferry. For some actors, such as <a href="Valeska%20Suratt">Valeska Suratt</a>, none of their films survive; "there are entire careers that don't exist because of [the fire]", according to <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> film curator <a href="Dave%20Kehr">Dave Kehr</a>. Copies located elsewhere have allowed some of Fox's silent films to survive as lower-quality prints, or in some cases fragments, but more than 75% of Fox's feature films from before 1930 are completely <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>. 

The Little Ferry vaults also held works by other film studios which had contracted with Fox for distribution. Educational Pictures lost more than 2,000 negatives and prints, including the negatives of <a href="Buster%20Keaton">Buster Keaton</a>'s silent films with the company. Also present was the original negative of <a href="D.%20W.%20Griffith">D. W. Griffith</a>'s "<a href="Way%20Down%20East">Way Down East</a>" (which Fox had purchased with the intent of remaking), the negative for the controversial Christie Productions <a href="sponsored%20film">sponsored film</a> "<a href="The%20Birth%20of%20a%20Baby">The Birth of a Baby</a>", and films by smaller studios such as Atherton Productions, Peck's Bad Boy Corporation, <a href="Principal%20Pictures">Principal Pictures</a>, and <a href="Serial%20Producing">Serial Producing</a>. Archival material intended for the Museum of Modern Art's Film Library was lost as well.
The destruction of the Little Ferry facility spurred an interest in <a href="fire%20safety">fire safety</a> as an aspect of film preservation. Unlike previous large nitrate-film fires, the spontaneous combustion of decomposing film stock was determined to be responsible. Investigators suggested that the older nitrocellulose film stored in the archive was of lower quality than then-current film, thus more prone to instability. The <a href="Society%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Engineers">Society of Motion Picture Engineers</a>'s Committee on Preservation of Film, three months after the vault fire, cited "recent and rather extensive film fires" as evidence that existing preservation efforts had failed to adequately address the "fire problem". More heavily reinforced film vaults were suggested, to prevent fires in a single vault from destroying entire archival facilities. Film storage cabinets with ventilation and cooling systems were also proposed, as was further research into improving the quality of <a href="cellulose%20acetate%20film">cellulose acetate film</a> to encourage its use as a safer replacement for nitrate film. By the 1950s, the use of nitrate film in the United States had been essentially eliminated.

Lazarus Aaronson

Lazarus Leonard Aaronson (18 February 1895 – 9 December 1966), often referred to as L. Aaronson, was a British <a href="poetry">poet</a> and a lecturer in <a href="economics">economics</a>. As a young man, he belonged to a group of Jewish friends who are today known as the <a href="Whitechapel%20Boys">Whitechapel Boys</a>, many of whom later achieved fame as writers and artists. Though less radical in his use of language, he has been compared to his more renowned Whitechapel friend, <a href="Isaac%20Rosenberg">Isaac Rosenberg</a>, in terms of <a href="diction">diction</a> and verbal energy. Aaronson's poetry is characterised more as <a href="Georgian%20Poetry">'post-Georgian'</a> than <a href="Literary%20modernism">modernistic</a>, and reviewers have since been able to trace influences back to both the English poet <a href="John%20Keats">John Keats</a>, and Hebrew poets such as <a href="Shaul%20Tchernichovsky">Shaul Tchernichovsky</a> and <a href="Zalman%20Shneur">Zalman Shneur</a>.

Aaronson lived most of his life in London and spent much of his working life as a <a href="lecturer">lecturer</a> in economics at the <a href="City%20of%20London%20College">City of London College</a>. In his twenties, he converted to Christianity and a large part of his poetry focused on his conversion and spiritual identity as a Jew and an <a href="English%20people">Englishman</a>. In total, he published three collections of poetry: "Christ in the Synagogue" (1930), "Poems" (1933), and "The Homeward Journey and Other Poems" (1946). Although he did not achieve widespread recognition, Aaronson gained a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a> of dedicated readers. Upon retiring from teaching, he moved to <a href="Harpenden%2C%20Hertfordshire">Harpenden</a>, <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>, where he died from heart failure and <a href="coronary%20heart%20disease">coronary heart disease</a> on 9 December 1966. His poetry was not widely publicised, and he left many unpublished poems at his death.

Aaronson was born on 18 February 1895 at 34 Great Pearl Street, <a href="Spitalfields">Spitalfields</a> in the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End of London</a> to poor <a href="Orthodox%20Jewish">Orthodox Jewish</a> parents who had immigrated from <a href="Vilna%20Governorate">Vilna</a> in the <a href="Pale%20of%20Settlement">Pale of Settlement</a> in Eastern Europe. His father was Louis Aaronson, a bootmaker, and his mother was Sarah Aaronson, "née" Kowalski. He attended Whitechapel City Boys' School and later received a scholarship to attend <a href="Hackney%20Downs%20School">Hackney Downs Grammar School</a>.

His father emigrated to New York in 1905. The rest of the family followed in 1912, except for 17-year old Lazarus who remained in London. From then on, he lived with the family of Joseph Posener at 292 Commercial Road in the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End of London</a>. At the time, the area was a hub of the Jewish <a href="diaspora">diaspora</a> and at the turn of the 20th century, a quarter of its population were Jews from Central and Eastern Europe. Growing up in the East End, Aaronson was part of a group of friends who are today referred to as the <a href="Whitechapel%20Boys">Whitechapel Boys</a>, all of whom were children of Jewish immigrants and shared literary and artistic ambitions. Others in the group who, like Aaronson, later achieved distinction included <a href="John%20Rodker">John Rodker</a>, <a href="Isaac%20Rosenberg">Isaac Rosenberg</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Leftwich">Joseph Leftwich</a>, <a href="Stephen%20Winsten">Stephen Winsten</a>, <a href="Clara%20Birnberg">Clara Birnberg</a>, <a href="David%20Bomberg">David Bomberg</a>, and the brothers <a href="Abraham%20Fineberg">Abraham Fineberg</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Fineberg">Joseph Fineberg</a>. Aaronson was also involved in the <a href="Young%20Socialist%20League">Young Socialist League</a>, where he and other Whitechapel Boys helped organise educational meetings on modern art and radical politics. Aaronson remained a committed <a href="Socialism">socialist</a> throughout adulthood.
Having been diagnosed with <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> and <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a>, Aaronson did not serve in the military during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. Between 1913 and 1915, and again between 1926 and 1928, he studied economics with a special focus on public administration at the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Economics">London School of Economics</a>, but never completed his degree.

Aaronson was married three times. His first wife was the actress <a href="Lydia%20Sherwood">Lydia Sherwood</a> (1906–1989), whom he was married to between 1924 and 1931. He filed for divorce on grounds of her adultery with the theatre producer <a href="Theodore%20Komisarjevsky">Theodore Komisarjevsky</a>, and the much publicised suit was undefended. His second marriage, which took place on 9 July 1938, to Dorothy Beatrice Lewer (1915–2005), also ended in divorce. On 14 January 1950, Aaronson married Margaret Olive Ireson (1920–1981), with whom he had one son, David, who was born in 1953.

To friends and family, Lazarus Aaronson was known as Laz. He was friends with the novelist <a href="Stephen%20Hudson">Stephen Hudson</a>, the sculptor <a href="Jacob%20Epstein">Jacob Epstein</a>, the media mogul <a href="Sidney%20Bernstein%2C%20Baron%20Bernstein">Sidney Bernstein</a>, the artists <a href="Mark%20Gertler%20%28artist%29">Mark Gertler</a> and <a href="Matthew%20Smith%20%28painter%29">Matthew Smith</a> and the poets <a href="Harold%20Monro">Harold Monro</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a>. Aaronson was also close to the economist <a href="David%20Graham%20Hutton">Graham Hutton</a>, who in 1952 made a radio programme about him for the BBC.

Around 1934, he began working as a lecturer in economics at the <a href="City%20of%20London%20College">City of London College</a>. Upon his retirement from the university in 1958, Aaronson was made a Member of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Order of the British Empire</a> in the <a href="1959%20New%20Year%20Honours">1959 New Year Honours</a>, in recognition of more than twenty-five years of service. The same year he moved with his family from London to <a href="Harpenden">Harpenden</a> in Hertfordshire, where he later died from <a href="Coronary%20artery%20disease">coronary heart disease</a> and heart failure on 9 December 1966, at the age of 71. He was buried in the Westfield Road Cemetery in Harpenden. His wife and young son survived him.

Aaronson had literary ambitions from an early age, and by 1914 he contributed his first work for the radical literary magazine "<a href="The%20New%20Age">The New Age</a>". He was often published under the name L. Aaronson. In the 1920s, he <a href="Religious%20conversion">converted</a> to Christianity. His first collection of poems, "Christ in the Synagogue", published by <a href="Victor%20Gollancz%20Ltd">V. Gollancz</a> in 1930, dealt to a large extent with his conversion and spiritual identity as both a Jew and an Englishman. This subject would become a recurring theme in his numerous mystical poems. "Christ in the Synagogue" reached only a small audience and received fewer than a dozen reviews, but "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>", "<a href="The%20Nation%20and%20Athenaeum">The Nation and Athenaeum</a>", "<a href="The%20Times%20Literary%20Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</a>", and "The New Age" wrote favourably of it.

Notwithstanding Aaronson's small readership, V. Gollancz published a second verse collection in 1933, titled "Poems". Despite being little known to the general public, Aaronson gained a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a> of dedicated readers. His third collection, "The Homeward Journey and Other Poems", was published in 1946 by Christophers, a small London publisher. Some of his works also appeared in journals and anthologies such as the 1953 "<a href="Faber%20Book%20of%20Twentieth%20Century%20Verse">Faber Book of Twentieth Century Verse</a>".
Since Aaronson's poetry does not display formal innovation, literature professor William Baker, characterises him as "A <a href="Georgian%20Poetry">post-Georgian</a> rather than a <a href="Modernist%20poetry%20in%20English">modernist</a> [poet]". Baker further notes that Aaronson's poetry deals with several issues of his time, such as the rise of <a href="fascism">fascism</a> and the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, but points out that Aaronson did not directly write about <a href="the%20Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>. Upon Aaronson's death, the poet <a href="Arthur%20Chaim%20Jacobs">Arthur Chaim Jacobs</a> compared him with <a href="Isaac%20Rosenberg">Isaac Rosenberg</a>, the more celebrated poet of the same <a href="British%20Jews">Anglo-Jewish</a> generation. According to Jacobs, Aaronson was "clearly influenced by him in terms of diction, and in a kind of verbal energy which runs through a lot of his poetry. But he was less radical than Rosenberg in his use of language, and tended towards <a href="John%20Keats">Keatsian</a> luxuriance and sweetness." The poet <a href="Jon%20Silkin">Jon Silkin</a> also unfavourably compared Aaronson to Rosenberg, writing "it cannot be said that his work attains to either the burning majesty or the depth of Rosenberg's poetry, and this is explicable perhaps by the fact that Aaronson does not altogether care to acknowledge his roots."

Although much of Aaronson's writings centred on his conversion to Christianity, Jacobs traces a continuing Hebraic mood in his poetry, and wrote that "his Christianity was hardly familiarly Anglican, and there is in his work an avowed sensuality which could in some ways be compared to that of modern Hebrew poets like <a href="Shaul%20Tchernichovsky">Tchernikowsky</a> or <a href="Zalman%20Shneur">Shneur</a>, or later, <a href="Avraham%20Shlonsky">Avraham Shlonsky</a>." According to his friend <a href="Joseph%20Leftwich">Joseph Leftwich</a>, Aronson himself in old age acknowledged influences from both traditional <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a> and <a href="Martin%20Buber">Martin Buber</a>'s unorthodox interpretation of <a href="Hasidism">Hasidism</a>.

Aaronson's poetry was not widely publicised, and he left over a thousand unpublished poems at his death. Little scholarly attention has been paid to his life and poetry. Upon Aaronson's death Jacobs stated that "Further assessment of his work awaits more substantial publication"; about 40 years later, Baker, who has written most extensively on Aaronson, named him among the Whitechapel intellectual writers and artists "today consigned to oblivion".

Nike-X

Nike-X was an <a href="anti-ballistic%20missile">anti-ballistic missile</a> (ABM) system designed in the 1960s by the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> to protect major cities in the United States from attacks by the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>'s <a href="intercontinental%20ballistic%20missile">intercontinental ballistic missile</a> (ICBM) fleet during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. The X in the name referred to its experimental basis and was supposed to be replaced by a more appropriate name when the system was put into production. This never came to pass; in 1967 the Nike-X program was canceled and replaced by a much lighter defense system known as <a href="Sentinel%20program">Sentinel</a>.

The Nike-X system was developed in response to limitations of the earlier <a href="LIM-49%20Nike%20Zeus">Nike Zeus</a> system. Zeus' radars could only track single targets, and it was calculated that a salvo of only four ICBMs would have a 90% chance of hitting a Zeus base. Zeus would have been useful in the late 1950s when the Soviets had only a few dozen missiles, but would be of little use by the early 1960s when it was believed the Soviets would have hundreds. The attacker could also use <a href="radar%20reflector">radar reflector</a>s or high-altitude nuclear explosions to obscure the warheads until they were too close to attack, making a single-warhead attack highly likely to succeed.

The key concept that led to Nike-X was that the rapidly thickening atmosphere below altitude disrupted the reflectors and explosions. Nike-X intended to wait until the enemy warheads descended below this altitude and then attack them using a very fast missile known as <a href="Sprint%20%28missile%29">Sprint</a>. The entire engagement would last only a few seconds and could take place as low as . To provide the needed speed and accuracy, as well as deal with multi-warhead attacks, Nike-X used a new radar system and building-filling computers that could track hundreds of objects at once and control salvos of many Sprints. Many dozens of warheads would need to arrive at the same time to overwhelm the system.

Building a complete deployment would have been extremely expensive, on the order of the total yearly budget of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Department of Defense</a>. <a href="Robert%20McNamara">Robert McNamara</a>, the Secretary of Defense, believed that the cost could not be justified and worried it would lead to a further <a href="nuclear%20arms%20race">nuclear arms race</a>. He directed the teams to consider deployments where a limited number of interceptors might still be militarily useful. Among these, the I-67 concept suggested building a lightweight defense against very limited attacks. 

When the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">People's Republic of China</a> exploded their first <a href="Thermonuclear%20weapon">H-bomb</a> in June 1967, I-67 was promoted as a defense against a Chinese attack, and this system became Sentinel in October. Nike-X development, in its original form, ended.

In 1955 the <a href="US%20Army">US Army</a> began considering the possibility of further upgrading their <a href="MIM-14%20Nike%20Hercules">Nike B</a> <a href="surface-to-air%20missile">surface-to-air missile</a> (SAM) as an anti-ballistic missile to intercept ICBMs. <a href="Bell%20Labs">Bell Labs</a>, the primary contractor for Nike, was asked to study the issue. Bell returned a report stating that the missile could be upgraded to the required performance relatively easily, but the system would need extremely powerful <a href="radar">radar</a> systems to detect the warhead while it was still far enough away to give the missile time to launch. All of this appeared to be within the <a href="state%20of%20the%20art">state of the art</a>, and in early 1957 Bell was given the go-ahead to develop what was then known as Nike II. Considerable <a href="interservice%20rivalry">interservice rivalry</a> between the Army and Air Force led to the Nike II being redefined and delayed several times. These barriers were swept aside in late 1957 after the launch of the <a href="R-7%20Semyorka">R-7 Semyorka</a>, the first Soviet ICBM. The design was further upgraded, given the name Zeus, and assigned the highest development priority.

Zeus was similar to the two Nike SAM designs that preceded it. It used a long range search radar to pick up targets, separate radars to track the target and interceptor missiles in flight, and a computer to calculate intercept points. The missile itself was much larger than earlier designs, with a range of up to , compared to Hercules' . To ensure a kill at altitude, where there was little atmosphere to carry a <a href="shock%20wave">shock wave</a>, it mounted a 400 <a href="TNT%20equivalent">kiloton</a> (kT) warhead. The search radar was a rotating triangle wide, able to pick out warheads while still over away, an especially difficult problem given the small size of a typical warhead. A new <a href="Transistor%20computer">transistorized digital computer</a> offered the performance needed to calculate trajectories for intercepts against warheads traveling over per second.

The Zeus missile began testing in 1959 at <a href="White%20Sands%20Missile%20Range">White Sands Missile Range</a> (WSMR) and early launches were generally successful. Longer range testing took place at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Point%20Mugu">Naval Air Station Point Mugu</a>, firing out over the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. For full-scale tests, the Army built an entire Zeus base on <a href="Kwajalein%20Island">Kwajalein Island</a> in the Pacific, where it could be tested against ICBMs launched from <a href="Vandenberg%20Air%20Force%20Base">Vandenberg Air Force Base</a> in California. Test firings at Kwajalein began in June 1962; these were very successful, passing within hundreds of yards of the warheads, and even low-flying satellites.

Zeus had initially been proposed in an era when ICBMs were extremely expensive and the US believed that the Soviet fleet contained a few dozen missiles. At a time when the US <a href="Deterrence%20theory">deterrent</a> fleet was based entirely on manned bombers, even a small number of missiles aimed at <a href="Strategic%20Air%20Command">Strategic Air Command</a>'s (SAC) bases presented a serious threat. Two Zeus deployment plans were outlined. One was a heavy defensive system that would provide protection over the entire continental United States, but require as many as 7000 Zeus missiles. McNamara supported a much lighter system that would use only 1200 missiles.

Technological improvements in warheads and missiles in the late 1950s greatly reduced the cost of ICBMs. After the launch of Sputnik, "<a href="Pravda">Pravda</a>" quoted <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> claiming they were building them "like sausages". This led to a series of intelligence estimates that predicted the Soviets would have hundreds of missiles by the early 1960s, creating the so-called "<a href="missile%20gap">missile gap</a>". It was later shown that the number of Soviet missiles did not reach the hundreds until the late 1960s, and at the time they had only four.
Zeus used mechanically steered radars, like the Nike SAMs before it, limiting the number of targets it could attack at once. A study by the <a href="Weapons%20Systems%20Evaluation%20Group">Weapons Systems Evaluation Group</a> (WSEG) calculated that the Soviets had a 90 percent chance of successfully hitting a Zeus base by firing only four warheads at it. These did not even have to land close in order to destroy the base; an explosion within several miles would destroy its radars, which were very difficult to <a href="Radiation%20hardening">harden</a>. If the Soviets did have hundreds of missiles, they could easily afford to use some to attack the Zeus sites.

Additionally, technical problems arose that appeared to make the Zeus almost trivially easy to defeat. One problem, discovered in <a href="Operation%20Hardtack%20I">tests during 1958</a>, was that nuclear fireballs expanded to very large sizes at high altitudes, rendering everything behind them invisible to radar. This was known as "<a href="nuclear%20blackout">nuclear blackout</a>". By the time an enemy warhead passed through the fireball, about above the base, it would only be about eight seconds from impact. That was not enough time for the radar to lock on and fire a Zeus before the warhead hit its target.

It was also possible to deploy radar decoys to confuse the defense. Decoys are made of lightweight materials, often <a href="Chaff%20%28countermeasure%29">strips of aluminum</a> or <a href="mylar">mylar</a> balloons, which can be packed in with the <a href="reentry%20vehicle">reentry vehicle</a> (RV), adding little weight. In space, these are ejected to create a "threat tube" a few kilometers across and tens of kilometers long. Zeus had to get within about to kill a warhead, which could be anywhere in the tube. The WSEG suggested that a single ICBM with decoys would almost certainly defeat Zeus. A mid-1961 staff report by ARPA suggested that a single large missile with multiple warheads would require four entire Zeus batteries, of 100 missiles each, to defeat it.

The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, today known as <a href="DARPA">DARPA</a>) was formed in 1958 by President <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a>'s Secretary of Defense, <a href="Neil%20H.%20McElroy">Neil McElroy</a>, in reaction to Soviet rocketry advances. US efforts had suffered from massive duplication of effort between the Army, Air Force, and Navy, and seemed to be accomplishing little in comparison to the Soviets. ARPA was initially handed the mission of overseeing all of these efforts. As the problems with Zeus became clear, McElroy also asked ARPA to consider the antimissile problem and come up with other solutions. The resulting <a href="Project%20Defender">Project Defender</a> was extremely broad in scope, considering everything from minor Zeus system upgrades to far-out concepts like <a href="antigravity">antigravity</a> and the recently invented <a href="laser">laser</a>.

Meanwhile, one improvement to Zeus was already being studied: a new <a href="phased-array%20radar">phased-array radar</a> replacing Zeus' mechanical ones would greatly increase the number of targets and interceptors that a single site could handle. Much more powerful computers were needed to match this performance. Additionally, the antennas were mounted directly in concrete and would have increased blast resistance. Initial studies at Bell Labs started in 1960 on what was then known as the Zeus Multi-function Array Radar, or ZMAR. In June 1961, <a href="Western%20Electric">Western Electric</a> and <a href="Sylvania%20Electric%20Products">Sylvania</a> were selected to build a prototype, with <a href="UNIVAC">Sperry Rand Univac</a> providing the control computer.

By late 1962 a decision on whether or not to deploy Zeus was looming. Bell began considering a replacement for the Zeus missile that would operate at much shorter ranges, and in October sent out study contracts to three contractors to be returned in February. Even before these were returned, in January 1963 McNamara announced that the construction funds allocated for Zeus would not be released, and the funding would instead be used for development of a new system using the latest technologies. The name Nike-X was apparently an "ad hoc" suggestion by <a href="Jack%20Ruina">Jack Ruina</a>, the director of ARPA, who was tasked with presenting the options to the <a href="President%27s%20Science%20Advisory%20Committee">President's Science Advisory Committee</a> (PSAC). With the ending of Zeus, the ZMAR radar effort was renamed MAR, and plans for an even more powerful version, MAR-II, became the central part of the Nike-X concept.

Decoys are lighter than the RV, and therefore suffer higher atmospheric <a href="Drag%20%28physics%29">drag</a> as they begin to reenter the atmosphere. This will eventually cause the RV to move out in front of the decoys. The RV can often be picked out earlier by examining the threat tube and watching for objects that have lower deceleration. This process, known as "atmospheric filtering", or more generally, "decluttering", will not provide accurate information until the threat tube begins to reenter the denser portions of the atmosphere, at altitudes around . Nike-X intended to wait until the decluttering was complete, meaning the interceptions would take place only seconds before the warheads hit their targets, between away from the base.

Low-altitude intercepts would also have the advantage of reducing the problem with nuclear blackout. The lower edge of the extended fireball used to induce this effect extended down to about 60 km, the same altitude at which decluttering became effective. Hence, low-altitude intercepts meant that deliberate attempts to create a blackout would not affect the tracking and guidance of the <a href="Sprint%20missile">Sprint missile</a>. Just as importantly, because the Sprint's own warheads would be going off far below this altitude, their fireballs would be much smaller and would only black out a small portion of the sky. The radar would have to survive the electrical effects of <a href="electromagnetic%20pulse">EMP</a>, and significant effort was expended on this. It also meant that the threat tube trajectories would have to be calculated rapidly, before or between blackout periods, and the final tracking of the warheads in the 10 seconds or so between clearing the clutter and hitting their targets. This demanded a very high-performance computer, one that did not exist at that time.

The centerpiece of the Nike-X system was MAR, using the then-new <a href="active%20electronically%20scanned%20array">active electronically scanned array</a> (AESA) concept to allow it to generate multiple virtual radar beams, simulating any number of mechanical radars needed. While one beam scanned the sky for new targets, others were formed to examine the threat tubes and generate high-quality tracking information very early in the engagement. More beams were formed to track the RVs once they had been picked out, and still more to track the Sprints on their way to the interceptions. To make all of this work, MAR required data processing capabilities on an unprecedented level, so Bell proposed building the system using the newly invented <a href="resistor%E2%80%93transistor%20logic">resistor–transistor logic</a> small-scale <a href="integrated%20circuit">integrated circuit</a>s. Nike-X centralized the battle control systems at their Defense Centers, consisting of a MAR and its associated underground Defense Center Data Processing System (DCDPS).

Because the Sprint was designed to operate at short range, a single base could not provide protection to a typical US city, given <a href="urban%20sprawl">urban sprawl</a>. This required the Sprint launchers to be distributed around the defended area. Because a Sprint launched from a remote base might not be visible to the MAR during the initial stages of the launch, Bell proposed building a much simpler radar at most launch sites, the Missile Site Radar (MSR). MSR would have just enough power and logic to generate tracks for its outgoing Sprint missiles and would hand that information off to the DCDPS using conventional <a href="telephone%20line">telephone line</a>s and <a href="modem">modem</a>s. Bell noted that the MSR could also provide a useful second-angle look at threat tubes, which might allow the decoys to be picked out earlier. Used as radio receivers, they could also triangulate any radio broadcasts coming from the threat tube, which the enemy might use as a <a href="Radar%20jamming%20and%20deception">radar jammer</a>.

When the system was first being proposed it was not clear whether the phased-array systems could provide the accuracy needed to guide the missiles to a successful interception at very long ranges. Early concepts retained Zeus Missile Tracking Radars and Target Tracking Radars (MTRs and TTRs) for this purpose. In the end, the MAR proved more than capable of the required resolution, and the additional radars were dropped.

Nike-X had been defined in the early 1960s as a system to defend US cities and industrial centers against a heavy Soviet attack during the 1970s. By 1965 the growing fleets of ICBMs in the inventories of both the US and USSR were making the cost of such a system very expensive. NIE 11-8-63, published 18 October 1963, estimated the Soviets would have 400–700 ICBMs deployed by 1969, and their deployment eventually reached 1,601 launchers, limited by the <a href="Strategic%20Arms%20Limitation%20Talks">SALT agreements</a>.

While Nike-X could be expected to attack these with a reasonable 1 to 1 exchange ratio, compared to Zeus' 20 to 1, it could only do so over a limited area. Most nationwide deployment scenarios contained thousands of Sprint missiles protecting only the largest US cities. Such a system would cost an estimated $40 billion to build ($ billion in , about half the annual military budget).

This led to further studies of the system to try to determine whether an ABM would be the proper way to save lives, or if there was some other plan that would do the same for less money. In the case of Zeus, for instance, it was clear that building more <a href="fallout%20shelter">fallout shelter</a>s would be less expensive and save more lives. A major report on the topic by PSAC in October 1961 made this point, suggesting that Zeus without shelters was useless, and that having Zeus might lead the US to "introduce dangerously misleading assumptions concerning the ability of the US to protect its cities".

This led to a series of increasingly sophisticated models to better predict the effectiveness of an ABM system and what the opposition would do to improve their performance against it. A key development was the <a href="Prim-Read%20theory">Prim-Read theory</a>, which provided an entirely mathematical solution to generating the ideal defensive layout. Using a Prim-Read layout for Nike-X, Air Force Brigadier General <a href="Glenn%20Kent">Glenn Kent</a> began considering Soviet responses. His 1964 report produced a cost-exchange ratio that required $2 of defense for every $1 of offence if one wanted to limit US casualties to 30 percent of the population. The cost increased to 6-to-1 if the US wished to limit casualties to 10 percent. ABMs would only be cheaper than ICBMs if the US was willing to allow over half its population to die in the exchange. When he realized he was using outdated exchange rates for the <a href="Soviet%20ruble">Soviet ruble</a>, the exchange ratio for the 30 percent casualty rate jumped to 20-to-1.

As the cost of defeating Nike-X by building more ICBMs was less than the cost of building Nike-X to counter them, reviewers concluded that the construction of an ABM system would simply prompt the Soviets to build more ICBMs. This led to serious concerns about a new <a href="arms%20race">arms race</a>, which it was believed would increase the chance of an accidental war. When the numbers were presented to McNamara, according to Kent:

In spite of its technical capabilities, Nike-X still shared one seemingly intractable problem that had first been noticed with Zeus. Facing an ABM system, the Soviets would change their targeting priorities to maximize damage, by attacking smaller, undefended cities for instance. Another solution was to drop their warheads just outside the range of the defensive missiles, upwind of the target. Ground bursts would throw enormous amounts of radioactive dust into the air, causing <a href="fallout">fallout</a> that would be almost as deadly as a direct attack. This would make the ABM system essentially useless unless the cities were also extensively protected from fallout. Those same fallout shelters would save many lives on their own, to the point that the ABM seemed almost superfluous. While reporting to Congress on the issue in the spring of 1964, McNamara noted:

Under any reasonable set of assumptions, even an advanced system like Nike-X offered only marginal protection and did so for huge costs. Around 1965, the ABM became what one historian calls a "technology in search of a mission". In early 1965, the Army launched a series of studies to find a mission concept that would lead to deployment.

One of the original deployment plans for Zeus had been a defensive system for <a href="Strategic%20Air%20Command">SAC</a>. The Air Force argued against such a system, in favor of building more ICBMs of their own. Their logic was that every Soviet missile launched in a <a href="counterforce">counterforce</a> strike could destroy a single US missile. If both forces had similar numbers of missiles, such an attack would leave both forces with few remaining missiles to launch a counterstrike. Adding Zeus would reduce the number of losses on the US side, helping ensure a counterstrike force would survive. The same would be true if the US built more ICBMs instead. The Air Force was far more interested in building its own missiles than the Army's, especially in the case of Zeus, which appeared to be easily outwitted.

Things changed in the early 1960s when McNamara placed limits on the Air Force fleet of 1,000 <a href="LGM-30%20Minuteman">Minuteman missiles</a> and 54 <a href="LGM-25C%20Titan%20II">Titan IIs</a>. This meant that the Air Force could not respond to new Soviet missiles by building more of their own. An even greater existential threat to Minuteman than Soviet missiles was the <a href="US%20Navy">US Navy</a>'s <a href="UGM-27%20Polaris">Polaris missile</a> fleet, whose invulnerability led to questions about the need for ground-based ICBMs. The Air Force responded by changing missions; the increasingly accurate Minuteman was now tasked with attacking Soviet missile silos, which the less accurate Navy missiles could not do. If the force was going to carry out this mission there had to be the expectation that enough missiles could survive a Soviet attack for a successful counterstrike. An ABM might provide that assurance.

A fresh look at this concept started at ARPA around 1963–64 under the name Hardpoint. This led to the construction of the Hardpoint Demonstration Array Radar, and an even faster missile concept known as <a href="HiBEX">HiBEX</a>. This proved interesting enough for the Army and Air Force to collaborate on a follow-up study, Hardsite. The first Hardsite concept, HSD-I, considered the defending of bases within urban areas that would have Nike-X protection anyway. An example might be a SAC command and control center or an airfield on the outskirts of a city. The second study, HSD-II, considered the protection of isolated bases like missile fields. Most follow-up work focused on the HSD-II concept.

HSD-II proposed building small Sprint bases close to Minuteman fields. Incoming warheads would be tracked until the last possible moment, decluttering them completely and generating highly accurate tracks. Since the warheads had to land within a short distance of a <a href="missile%20silo">missile silo</a> to damage it, any warheads that could be seen to be falling outside that area were simply ignored – only those entering the "Site Protection Volume" needed to be attacked. At the time, Soviet <a href="inertial%20navigation%20system">inertial navigation system</a>s (INS) were not particularly accurate. This acted as a <a href="force%20multiplier">force multiplier</a>, allowing a few Sprints to defend against many ICBMs.

Although initially supportive of the Hardsite concept, by 1966 the Air Force came to oppose it largely for the same reasons it had opposed Zeus in the same role. If money was to be spent on protecting Minuteman, they felt that money would be better spent by the Air Force than the Army. As <a href="Morton%20Halperin">Morton Halperin</a> noted:

During the project's development phase, the siting and size of the Nike-X bases became a major complaint of smaller cities. Originally intended to protect only the largest urban areas, Nike-X was designed to be built at a very large size with many missiles controlled by an expensive computer and radar network. Smaller sites were to be left undefended in the original Nike-X concept since the system was simply too expensive to build with only a few interceptors. These cities complained that they were not only being left open to attack, but that their lack of defenses might make them primary targets. This led to a series of studies on the Small City Defense (SCD) concept. By 1964 SCD had become part of the baseline Nike-X deployment plans, with every major city being provided some level of defensive system.

SCD would consist primarily of a single autonomous battery centered on a cut-down MAR called TACMAR (TACtical MAR), along with a simplified data processing system known as the Local Data Processor (LDP). This was essentially the DCDP with fewer modules installed, reducing the number of tracks it could compile and the amount of decluttering it could handle. To further reduce costs, Bell later replaced the cut-down MAR with an upgraded MSR, the "Autonomous MSR". They studied a wide variety of potential deployments, starting with systems like the original Nike-X proposal with no SCDs, to deployments offering complete continental US protection with many SCD modules of various types and sizes. The deployments were arranged so that they could be built in phases, working up to complete coverage.

One issue that emerged from these studies was the problem of providing early warning to the SCD sites. The SCD's MSR radars provided detection at perhaps , which meant targets would appear on their radars only seconds before launches would have to be carried out. In a sneak attack scenario, there would not be enough time to receive command authority for the release of nuclear weapons. This meant the bases would require <a href="launch%20on%20warning">launch on warning</a> authority, which was politically unacceptable.

This led to proposals for a new radar dedicated solely to the early warning role, determining only which MAR or SCD would ultimately have to deal with the threat. Used primarily in the first minutes of the attack, and not responsible for the engagements, the system could be considered disposable and did not need anything like the sophistication or hardening of the MAR. This led to the Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR), which would operate cheaper electronics at <a href="VHF">VHF</a> frequencies.

The high-altitude explosions that had caused so much concern for Nike Zeus due to blackout had been further studied in the early 1960s and led to a new possibility for missile defense. When a nuclear warhead explodes in a dense atmosphere, its initial high-energy <a href="X-rays">X-rays</a> ionize the air, blocking other X-rays. In the highest layers of the atmosphere, there is too little gas for this to occur, and the X-rays can travel long distances. Sufficient X-ray exposure to an RV can damage its <a href="heat%20shield">heat shield</a>s.

In late 1964 Bell was considering the role of an X-ray-armed Zeus missile in the Nike-X system. A January 1965 report outlines this possibility, noting that it would have to have a much larger warhead dedicated to the production of X-rays, and would have to operate at higher altitudes to maximize the effect. A major advantage was that accuracy needs were much reduced, from a minimum of about for the original Zeus' neutron-based attack, to something on the order of a few miles. This meant that the range limits of the original Zeus, which were defined by the accuracy of the radars to about , were greatly eased. This, in turn, meant that a less sophisticated radar could be used, one with accuracy on the order of a mile rather than feet, which could be built much less expensively using <a href="VHF">VHF</a> parts.

This Extended Range Nike Zeus, or Zeus EX for short, would be able to provide protection over a wider area, reducing the number of bases needed to provide full-country defense. Work on this concept continued throughout the 1960s, eventually becoming the primary weapon in the following Sentinel system, and in the modified Sentinel system that was later renamed <a href="Safeguard%20Program">Safeguard</a>.

In February 1965 the Army asked Bell to consider different deployment concepts under the Nth Country study. This examined what sort of system would be needed to provide protection against an unsophisticated attack with a limited number of warheads. Using Zeus EX, a few bases could provide coverage for the entire US. The system would be unable to deal with large numbers of warheads, but that was not a concern for a system that would only be tasked with beating off small attacks.

With only small numbers of targets, the full MAR was not needed and Bell initially proposed TACMAR to fill this need. This would have a shorter detection range, so a long range radar like PAR would be needed for early detection. The missile sites would consist of a single TACMAR along with about 20 Zeus EX missiles. In October 1965 the TACMAR was replaced by the upgraded MSR from the SCD studies. Since this radar had an even shorter range than TACMAR, it could not be expected to generate tracking information in time for a Zeus EX launch. PAR would thus have to be upgraded to have higher accuracy and the processing power to generate tracks that would be handed off to the MSRs. During this same time, Bell had noted problems with long wavelength radars in the presence of radar blackout. Both of these issues argued for a change from VHF to <a href="UHF">UHF</a> frequencies for the PAR.

Further work along these lines led to the Nike-X Deployment Study, or DEPEX. DEPEX outlined a deployment that started out very similar to Nth Country, with a few bases primarily using Nike EX to provide lightweight cover, but which also included design features that allowed more bases to be added as the nature of the threat changed. The study described a four-phase deployment sequence that added more and more terminal defenses as the sophistication of the Nth Country missiles increased over time.

In December 1966, the Army asked Bell to prepare a detailed deployment concept combining the light defense of Nth Country with the point defense of Hardsite. On 17 January 1967, this became the I-67 project, which delivered its results on 5 July. I-67 was essentially Nth Country but with more bases near Minuteman fields, armed primarily with Sprint. The wide-area Zeus and short-range Sprint bases would both be supported by the PAR network.

The basic outlines of these various studies were becoming clear by 1966. The heavy defense from the original Nike-X proposals would cost about $40 billion ($ billion in ) and offer limited protection and damage prevention in an all-out attack, but would be expected to blunt or completely defeat any smaller attack. The thin defense of Nth Country would be much less expensive, around $5 billion ($ billion in ), but would only have any effect at all under certain limited scenarios. Finally, the Hardsite concepts would cost about the same as the thin defense, and provide some protection against a certain class of counterforce attacks.

None of these concepts appeared to be worth deploying, but there was considerable pressure from Congressional groups dominated by <a href="War%20hawk">hawks</a> who continued to force development of the ABM even when McNamara and <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">President Johnson</a> had not asked for it. The debate spilled over into the public and led to comments about an "ABM gap", especially by Republican Governor <a href="George%20W.%20Romney">George W. Romney</a>. The Air Force continued their opposition to the ABM concept, having previously criticized their earlier efforts in the press, but the construction of the <a href="A-35%20anti-ballistic%20missile%20system">A-35</a> ABM systems around <a href="Tallinn">Tallinn</a> and <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> overrode their opposition. The <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> (JCS) used the Soviet ABM as an argument for deployment, having previously had no strong opinion on the matter.

McNamara attempted to short-circuit deployment in early 1966 by stating that the only program that had any reasonable cost-effectiveness was the thin defense against the Chinese, and then noted there was no rush to build such a system as it would be some time before they had an ICBM. Overruling him, Congress provided $167.9 million ($ billion in ) for immediate production of the original Nike-X concept. McNamara and Johnson met on the issue on 3 November 1966, and McNamara once again convinced Johnson that the system could not justify the cost of deployment. McNamara headed off the expected counterattack from Romney by calling a press conference on the topic of Soviet ABMs and stating that the new Minuteman III and <a href="UGM-73%20Poseidon">Poseidon SLBM</a> would ensure the Soviet system would be overwhelmed.

Another meeting on the issue was called on 6 December 1966, attended by Johnson, McNamara, the deputy Secretary of Defense <a href="Cyrus%20Vance">Cyrus Vance</a>, <a href="Walt%20Rostow">Walt Rostow</a> of the <a href="National%20Security%20Agency">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) and the Joint Chiefs. Rostow took the side of the JCS and it appeared that development would start. However, McNamara once again outlined the problems and stated that the simplest way to close the ABM gap was to simply build more ICBMs, rendering the Soviet system impotent and a great waste of money. He then proposed that the money sidelined by Congress for deployment be used for initial deployment studies while the US attempted to negotiate an arms limitation treaty. Johnson agreed with this compromise, and ordered Secretary of State <a href="Dean%20Rusk">Dean Rusk</a> to open negotiations with the Soviets.

By 1967 the debate over ABM systems had become a major public policy issue, with almost continual debate on the topic in newspapers and magazines. It was in the midst of these debates, on 17 June 1967, that the Chinese tested their first <a href="Thermonuclear%20weapon">H-bomb</a> in <a href="Test%20No.%206">Test No. 6</a>. Suddenly the Nth Country concept was no longer simply theoretical. McNamara seized on this event as a way to deflect criticism over the lack of deployment while still keeping costs under control. On 18 September 1967, he announced that Nike-X would now be known as Sentinel, and outlined deployment plans broadly following the I-67 concept.

Although the original Nike-X concept was canceled, some of its components were built and tested both as part of Nike-X and the follow-on Sentinel. MAR, MSR, Sprint and Spartan were the main programs during the Nike-X period.

Work in ZMAR was already underway by the early 1960s, before McNamara canceled Zeus in 1963. Initial contracts were offered to <a href="Sylvania%20Electric%20Products">Sylvania</a> and <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a> (GE), who both built experimental systems consisting of a single row of elements, essentially a slice of a larger array. Sylvania's design used <a href="Modulation%20Scan%20Array%20Radar">MOSAR</a> phase-shifting using time delays, while GE's used a "novel modulation scanning system". Sylvania's system won a contract for a test system, which became MAR-I when Nike-X took over from Zeus.

To save money, the prototype MAR-I would only install antenna elements for the inner section of the original diameter antenna, populating the central . This had the side-effect of reducing the number of antenna elements from 6,405 to 2,245 but would not change the basic control logic. The number of elements on the transmitter face was similarly reduced. A full sized, four-sided MAR would require 25,620 <a href="parametric%20amplifier">parametric amplifier</a>s to be individually wired by hand, so building the smaller MAR-I greatly reduced cost and construction time. Both antennas were built full sized and could be expanded out to full MAR performance at any time. In spite of these cost reduction methods, MAR-I cost an estimated $100 million to build ($ million in ).

A test site for MAR-I had already been selected at WSMR, about a mile off of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2070">US Route 70</a>, and some north of the Army's main missile launch sites along WSMR Route 2 (Nike Avenue). A new road, WSMR Route 15, was built to connect the MAR-I to <a href="White%20Sands%20Launch%20Complex%2038">Launch Complex 38</a> (LC38), the Zeus launch site. MAR-I's northern location meant that the MAR would see the many rocket launches taking place at the Army sites to the south, as well as the target missiles that were launched towards them from the north from the <a href="Green%20River%20Launch%20Complex">Green River Launch Complex</a> in Utah.

Since MAR was central to the entire Nike-X system, it had to survive attacks directed at the radar itself. At the time, the response of hardened buildings to nuclear shock was not well understood, and the MAR-I building was extremely strong. It consisted of a large central hemispherical dome of thick <a href="reinforced%20concrete">reinforced concrete</a> with similar but smaller domes arranged on the corners of a square bounding the central dome. The central dome held the receiver arrays, and the smaller domes the transmitters. The concept was designed to allow a transmitter and receiver to be built into any of the faces to provide wide coverage around the radar site. As a test site, MAR-I only installed the equipment on the northwest facing side, although provisions were made for a second set on the northeast side that was never used. A tall <a href="clutter%20fence">clutter fence</a> surrounded the building, preventing reflections from nearby mountains.

Groundbreaking on the MAR-I site started in March 1963 and construction proceeded rapidly. The radar was powered up for the first time in June 1964 and achieved its first successful tracking on 11 September 1964, repeatedly tracking and breaking lock on a balloon target over a 50-minute period. However, the system demonstrated very low reliability in the transmitter's <a href="travelling%20wave%20tube">travelling wave tube</a> (TWT) amplifiers, which led to an extremely expensive re-design and re-installation. Once upgraded, MAR-I demonstrated the system would work as expected; it could generate multiple virtual radar beams, could simultaneously generate different "types" of beams for detection, tracking, and discrimination at the same time, and had the accuracy and speed needed to generate many tracks.

By this time work had already begun on MAR-II on Kwajalein; built by General Electric, it differed in form and in its beam steering system. The prototype MAR-II was built on reclaimed land just west of the original Zeus site. MAR-II was built into a pyramid with its back half removed. Like MAR-I, to save money MAR-II would be equipped with only one set of transmitter and receiver elements, but with all the wiring in place in case it had to be upgraded in the future. Nike-X was canceled before MAR-II was complete, and the semi-completed building was instead used as a climate-controlled storage facility.

Testing on MAR-I lasted until 30 September 1967. It continued to be used at a lower level as part of the Sentinel developments. This work ended in May 1969, when the facility was mothballed. In November, the building was re-purposed as the main fallout shelter for everyone at <a href="Holloman%20Air%20Force%20Base">Holloman Air Force Base</a>, about to the east. To hold the 5,800 staff and their dependents, starting in 1970 the radar and its underground equipment areas were completely emptied. In the early 1980s, the site was selected as the basis for the <a href="High%20Energy%20Laser%20Systems%20Test%20Facility">High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility</a>, and extensively redeveloped.

In 1972, <a href="Stirling%20Colgate">Stirling Colgate</a>, a professor at <a href="New%20Mexico%20Institute%20of%20Mining%20and%20Technology">New Mexico Tech</a>, wrote a letter to <a href="Science%20%28journal%29">"Science"</a> proposing salvaging MAR. He felt that after minor re-tuning it would make an excellent <a href="radio%20astronomy">radio astronomy</a> instrument for observing the <a href="hydrogen%20line">hydrogen line</a>. Colgate's suggestion was never adopted, but over 2000 of the Western Electric parametric amplifiers driving the system ended up being salvaged by the university. About a dozen of these found their way into the astronomy field, including Colgate's <a href="supernova">supernova</a> detector, SNORT.

About 2,000 remained in storage at New Mexico Tech until 1980. An assay at that time discovered that there was well over one ounce of gold in each one, and the remaining stocks were melted down to produce $941,966 for the university ($ million in ). The money was used to build a new wing on the university's Workman Center, known unofficially as the "Gold Building".

Bell ran studies to identify the sweet spot for the MSR that would allow it to have enough functionality to be useful at different stages of the attack, as well as being inexpensive enough to justify its existence in a system dominated by MAR. This led to an initial proposal for an <a href="S%20band">S band</a> system using passive scanning (PESA) that was sent out in October 1963. Of the seven proposals received, <a href="Raytheon">Raytheon</a> won the development contract in December 1963, with <a href="Varian%20Associates">Varian</a> providing the high-power <a href="klystron">klystron</a>s (twystrons) for the transmitter.

An initial prototype design was developed between January and May 1964. When used with MAR, the MSR needed only short range, enough to hand off the Sprint missiles. This led to a design with limited radiated power. For Small City Defense, this would not offer enough power to acquire the warheads at reasonable range. This led to an upgraded design with five times the transmitter power, which was sent to Raytheon in May 1965. A further upgrade in May 1966 included the battle control computers and other features for the SCD system.

The earlier Zeus system had taken up most of the available land on Kwajalein Island itself, so the missile launchers and MSR were to be built on <a href="Meck%20Island">Meck Island</a>, about north. This site would host a complete MSR, allowing the Army to test both MAR-hosted (using MAR-II) and autonomous MSR deployments. A second launcher site was built on <a href="Illeginni%20Island">Illeginni Island</a>, northwest of Meck, with two Sprint and two Spartan launchers. Three camera stations built to record the Illeginni launches were installed, and these continue to be used .

Construction of the launch site on Meck began in late 1967. In this installation, the majority of the system was built above ground in a single-floor rectangular building. The MSR was built in a boxy extension on the northwestern corner of the roof, with two sides angled back to form a half-pyramid shape where the antennas were mounted. Small clutter fences were built to the north and northwest, and the western side faced out over the water which was only a few tens of meters from the building. Illeginni did not have a radar site; it was operated remotely from Meck.

On 1 October 1962, Bell's Nike office sent specifications for a high-speed missile to three contractors. The responses were received on 1 February 1963, and <a href="Martin%20Marietta">Martin Marietta</a> was selected as the winning bidder on 18 March.

Sprint ultimately proved to be the most difficult technical challenge of the Nike-X system. Designed to intercept incoming warheads at an altitude of about , it had to have unmatched acceleration and speed. This caused enormous problems in materials, controls, and even receiving radio signals through the ionized air around the missile. The development program was referred to as "pure agony".

In the original Nike-X plans, Sprint was the primary weapon and thus was considered to be an extremely high-priority development. To speed development, a sub-scale version of Sprint known as Squirt was tested from Launch Complex 37 at White Sands, the former Nike Ajax/Hercules test area. A total of five Squirts were fired between 6 November 1964 and 1965. The first Sprint Propulsion Test Vehicle (PTV) was launched from another area at the same complex on 17 November 1965, only 25 months after the final design was signed off. Sprint testing pre-dated construction of an MSR, and the missiles were initially guided by Zeus TTR and MTR radars. Testing continued under Safeguard, with a total of 42 test flights at White Sands and another 34 at Kwajalein.

Zeus B had been test fired at both White Sands and the Zeus base on Kwajalein. For Nike-X, the extended range EX model was planned, replacing Zeus' second stage with a larger model that provided more thrust through the midsection of the boost phase. Also known as the DM-15X2, the EX was renamed Spartan in January 1967. The Spartan never flew as part of the original Nike-X, and its first flight in March 1968 took place under Sentinel.

One of the reasons for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able to tell the difference between the warhead and a decoy until it was too late to launch. One solution to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look for some sort of signature of the reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; in particular, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.

The reentry phenomenology was of interest both to the Army, as it might allow long-range decluttering to be carried out, and to the Air Force, whose own ICBMs might be at risk of long-range interception if the Soviets exploited a similar concept. A program to test these concepts was a major part of ARPA's Project Defender, especially Project PRESS, which started in 1960. This led to the construction of high-power radar systems on <a href="Roi-Namur">Roi-Namur</a>, the northernmost point of the Kwajalein atoll. Although the results remain classified, several sources mention the failure to find a reliable signature of this sort.

In 1964, Bell Labs formulated their own set of requirements for radar work in relation to Nike-X. Working with the Army, Air Force, Lincoln Labs and ARPA, the Nike-X Reentry Measurements Program (RMP) ran a long series of reentry measurements with the <a href="Project%20PRESS">Project PRESS</a> radars, especially <a href="Tradex%20radar">TRADEX</a>. Additionally, a <a href="Lockheed%20EC-121%20Warning%20Star">Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star</a> aircraft was refit with optical and <a href="infrared">infrared</a> telescopes for optical tracking tests. The first series of tests, RMP-A, focused on modern conical reentry vehicles. It concluded on 30 June 1966. These demonstrated that these vehicles were difficult to discriminate because of their low drag. RMP-B ran between 1967 and 1970, supported by 17 launches from Vandenberg, with a wide variety of vehicle shapes and penetration aids.

The program ran until the 1970s, but by the late 1960s, it was clear that discrimination of decoys was an unsolved problem, although some of the techniques developed might still be useful against less sophisticated decoys. This work appears to be one of the main reasons that the thin defense of I-67 was considered worthwhile. At that time, in 1967, ARPA passed the PRESS radars to the Army.

A typical Nike-X deployment around a major city would have consisted of several missile batteries. One of these would be equipped with the MAR and its associated DCDP computers, while the others would optionally have an MSR. The sites were all networked together using communications equipment working at normal voice bandwidths. Some of the smaller bases would be built north of the MAR to provide protection to this central station.

Almost every aspect of the battle would be managed by the DCDPS at the MAR base. The reason for this centralization was two-fold; one was that the radar system was extremely complex and expensive and could not be built in large numbers, the second was that the transistor-based computers needed to process the data were likewise very expensive. Nike-X thus relied on a few very expensive sites, and many greatly simplified batteries.

MAR was an <a href="L%20band">L band</a> active electronically scanned phased-array radar. The original MAR-I had been built into a strongly reinforced dome, but the later designs consisted of two half-pyramid shapes, with the transmitters in a smaller pyramid in front of the receivers. The reduction in size and complexity was the result of studies on nuclear hardening, especially those carried out as part of <a href="Operation%20Prairie%20Flat">Operation Prairie Flat</a> and <a href="Operation%20Snowball%20%28test%29">Operation Snowball</a> in <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, where a sphere of <a href="Trinitrotoluene">TNT</a> was detonated to simulate a nuclear explosion.

MAR used separate transmitter and receivers, a necessity at the time due to the size of the individual transmit and receive units and the switching systems that would be required. Each transmitter antenna was fed by its own power amplifier using travelling wave tubes with switching <a href="diode">diode</a>s and <a href="stripline">stripline</a>s performing the delays. The broadcast signal had three parts in sequence and the receivers had three channels, one tuned to each part of the pulse chain. This allowed the receiver to send each part of the signal to different processing equipment, allowing search, track, and discrimination in a single pulse.

MAR operated in two modes: surveillance and engagement. In surveillance mode, the range was maximized, and each face performed a scan in about 5 seconds. Returns were fed into systems that automatically extracted the range and velocity, and if the return was deemed interesting, the system automatically began a track for threat verification. During the threat verification phase, the radar spent more time examining the returns in an effort to accurately determine the trajectory and then ignored any objects that would fall outside its area.

Those targets that did pose a threat automatically triggered the switch to engagement mode. This created a new beam constantly aimed at the target, sweeping its focus point through the threat tube to pick out individual objects within it. Data from these beams extracted velocity data to a separate computer to attempt to pick out the warhead as the decoys slowed in the atmosphere. Only one Coherent Signal Processing System (CSPS) was ever built, and for testing it was connected to the Zeus Discrimination Radar on Kwajalein.

Nike-X also considered a cut down version of MAR known as TACMAR. This was essentially a MAR with half of the elements hooked up, reducing its price at the cost of shorter detection range. The processing equipment was likewise reduced in complexity, lacking some of the more sophisticated discrimination processing. TACMAR was designed from the start to be able to be upgraded to full MAR performance if needed, especially as the sophistication of the threat grew. MAR-II is sometimes described as the prototype TACMAR, but there is considerable confusion on this point in existing sources.

As initially conceived, MSR was a short-range system for tracking Sprint missiles before they appeared in the MAR's view, as well as offering a secondary target and jammer tracking role. In this initial concept, the MSR would have limited processing power, just enough to create tracks to feed back to the MAR. In the anti-jamming role, each MAR and MSR would measure the angle to the jammer.

The MSR was an S-band <a href="passive%20electronically%20scanned%20array">passive electronically scanned array</a> (PESA), unlike the actively scanned MAR. A PESA system cannot (normally) generate multiple signals like AESA, but is much less expensive to build because a single transmitter and receiver is used for the entire system. The same antenna array can easily be used for both transmitting and receiving, as the area behind the array is much less cluttered and has ample room for switching in spite of the large <a href="radio%20frequency">radio frequency</a> switches needed at this level of power.

Unlike the MAR, which would be tracking targets primarily from the north, the MSR would be tracking its interceptors in all directions. MSR was thus built into a four-faced truncated pyramid, with any or all of the faces carrying radar arrays. Isolated sites, like the one considered in Hawaii, would normally have arrays on all four faces. Those that were networked into denser systems could reduce the number of faces and get the same information by sending tracking data from site to site.

Sprint was the primary weapon of Nike-X as originally conceived; it would have been placed in clusters around the targets being defended by the MAR system. Each missile was housed in an underground silo and was driven into the air before launch by a gas-powered piston. The missile was initially tracked by the local MSR, which would hand off tracking to the MAR as soon as it became visible. A <a href="transponder">transponder</a> in the missile would respond to signals from either the MAR or MSR to provide a powerful return for accurate tracking.

Although a primary concern of the Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not optimized for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its manoeuvrability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected <a href="Freon">Freon</a> into the exhaust to cause <a href="thrust%20vectoring">thrust vectoring</a> to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.

The first stage accelerated the missile at over 100 <a href="g-force">g</a>, reaching <a href="Mach%20number">Mach 10</a> in a few seconds. At these speeds, <a href="aerodynamic%20heating">aerodynamic heating</a> caused the airframe's outer layer to become hotter than an <a href="Oxy-fuel%20welding%20and%20cutting">oxy-acetylene welding torch</a>. The required acceleration required a new solid fuel mixture that burned ten times as fast as contemporary designs such as the Pershing or Minuteman. The burning fuel and aerodynamic heating together created so much heat that radio signals were strongly attenuated through the resulting <a href="plasma%20%28physics%29">ionized plasma</a> around the missile body. It was expected that the average interception would take place at about at a range of after 10 seconds of flight time.

Two warheads were designed for Sprint starting in 1963, the <a href="W65">W65</a> at <a href="Lawrence%20Livermore%20National%20Laboratory">Livermore</a> and the <a href="W66">W66</a> at <a href="Los%20Alamos%20National%20Laboratory">Los Alamos</a>. The W65 was entering Phase 3 testing in October 1965 with a design yield of around 5 kT, but this was cancelled in January 1968 in favor of the W66. The W66's explosive yield was reported to have been in the "low kiloton" range, with various references claiming it was anywhere from 1 to 20 kT. The W66 was the first enhanced radiation bomb, or <a href="neutron%20bomb">neutron bomb</a>, to be fully developed; it was tested in the late 1960s and entered production in June 1974.

Hebron Church (Intermont, West Virginia)

Hebron Church (also historically known as Great Capon Church, Hebron Lutheran Church, and Hebron Evangelical Lutheran Church) is a mid-19th-century <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a> church in <a href="Intermont%2C%20West%20Virginia">Intermont</a>, <a href="Hampshire%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia">Hampshire County</a>, in the U.S. state of <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>. Hebron Church was founded in 1786 by <a href="German%20Americans">German settlers</a> in the <a href="Cacapon%20River">Cacapon River</a> Valley, making it the first Lutheran church west of the <a href="Shenandoah%20Valley">Shenandoah Valley</a>. The congregation worshiped in a <a href="log%20house">log church</a>, which initially served both Lutheran and <a href="Calvinism">Reformed</a> denominations. Its congregation was originally German-speaking; the church's documents and religious services were in German until 1821, when records and sermons transitioned to English.

The church's congregation built the present <a href="Greek%20Revival%20architecture">Greek Revival</a>-style -story church building in 1849, when it was renamed Hebron on the Cacapon. The original log church was moved across the road and subsequently used as a <a href="Sexton%20%28office%29">sexton's house</a>, <a href="Sunday%20school">Sunday school</a> classroom, and public schoolhouse (attended by future West Virginia governor <a href="Herman%20G.%20Kump">Herman G. Kump</a>).

To celebrate the congregation's 175th anniversary in 1961, Hebron Church constructed a brick community and religious education building designed to be architecturally compatible with the 1849 brick church. As of October 2015, the church continues to be used by the <a href="West%20Virginia-Western%20Maryland%20Synod">West Virginia-Western Maryland Synod</a> of the <a href="Evangelical%20Lutheran%20Church%20in%20America">Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</a>. Hebron Church was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on December 16, 2014, for its architectural distinction as a local example of <a href="Vernacular%20architecture">vernacular</a> Greek Revival church architecture in the <a href="Potomac%20Highlands%20of%20West%20Virginia">Potomac Highlands</a>.

Hebron Church and its <a href="churchyard">cemetery</a> are located east of Carpers Pike (<a href="West%20Virginia%20Route%20259">West Virginia Route 259</a>) in the <a href="Unincorporated%20area">unincorporated community</a> of <a href="Intermont%2C%20West%20Virginia">Intermont</a>, about southwest of <a href="Yellow%20Spring%2C%20West%20Virginia">Yellow Spring</a>, and northeast of the town of <a href="Wardensville%2C%20West%20Virginia">Wardensville</a>. <a href="Capon%20Lake%2C%20West%20Virginia">Capon Lake</a> and the <a href="Capon%20Lake%20Whipple%20Truss%20Bridge">Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge</a> are northeast of the church. The church and its cemetery are on a lot.

Hebron Church is on the plain of a predominantly rural agricultural and forested area of southeastern <a href="Hampshire%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia">Hampshire County</a>, in the Cacapon River Valley. Baker Mountain, a forested, narrow <a href="Anticline">anticlinal</a> mountain ridge, rises west of the church, and the western rolling foothills of the anticlinal <a href="Great%20North%20Mountain">Great North Mountain</a> rise east of the valley. The Cacapon River, just southeast of the church, is hidden from the church and cemetery by mature foliage. <a href="George%20Washington%20and%20Jefferson%20National%20Forests">George Washington National Forest</a>, encompassing the forested area east of the Cacapon River, is east of the church.

The <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> listing for Hebron Church includes the brick church and cemetery. They are accessible from WV 259 by a semicircular asphalt driveway, separated from the church and cemetery by a <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a> fence and lined with large, old-growth <a href="maple">maple</a> trees along the property's northwestern perimeter. A paved brick walkway leads from the gate to the northwestern façade and two main entrances of the church. The church is surrounded on its northeastern, southeastern, and southwestern sides by a cemetery which is still in use. The cemetery contains over 600 gravestones, several <a href="yucca">yucca</a>s, a <a href="Tsuga">hemlock</a> tree, and a <a href="Buxus">boxwood</a>. A modern brick community building, within the historic boundary south of the church and cemetery, is used for church activities.

The land upon which Hebron Church and its cemetery are located was originally part of the <a href="Northern%20Neck%20Proprietary">Northern Neck Proprietary</a>, a land grant that the exiled <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> awarded to seven of his supporters in 1649 during the <a href="Interregnum%20%28England%29">English Interregnum</a>. Following the <a href="Restoration%20%28England%29">Restoration</a> in 1660, Charles II finally ascended to the English throne. Charles II renewed the Northern Neck Proprietary grant in 1662, revised it in 1669, and again renewed the original grant favoring original grantee <a href="Thomas%20Colepeper%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Colepeper">Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper</a> and <a href="Henry%20Bennet%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Arlington">Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington</a> in 1672. In 1681, Bennet sold his share to Lord Colepeper, and Lord Colepeper received a new charter for the entire land grant from <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a> in 1688. Following the deaths of Lord Colepeper, his wife Margaret, and his daughter Katherine, the Northern Neck Proprietary passed to Katherine's son <a href="Thomas%20Fairfax%2C%206th%20Lord%20Fairfax%20of%20Cameron">Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron</a> in 1719.

Under Lord Fairfax's ownership, the Cacapon River Valley was predominantly inhabited by <a href="British%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">English-speaking settlers</a> as early as the late 1730s; most came from <a href="Province%20of%20Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="Province%20of%20New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>. As settlement progressed during the second half of the 18th century, the fertile land of Hampshire County (including the Cacapon River Valley) also attracted German settlers from Pennsylvania and elsewhere in Virginia before and after the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> (1775–1783).

As the population of German settlers in the region began to increase, the desire for Lutheran religious services and education also grew. Ministers, including <a href="Henry%20Muhlenberg">Henry Muhlenberg</a> disciple Christian Streit, began to establish congregations in the largest communities of western Virginia. Muhlenberg was a German pastor, requested by colonists in Pennsylvania, who served as a missionary there from 1742 until his death in 1787; he is considered the patriarch of the Lutheran Church in the United States. Johannes Schwarback and Muhlenberg's son, <a href="Peter%20Muhlenberg">Peter</a>, reportedly visited the Cacapon River Valley between 1763 and 1776 (before Hebron Church's founding). Streit, charged with ministering to a Lutheran congregation in <a href="Winchester%2C%20Virginia">Winchester</a>, settled there on July 19, 1785.

Hebron Church, originally known as the Great Capon Church, was established by early German settlers in 1786 as a united German congregation of the <a href="Calvinism">Reformed</a> and Lutheran denominations. The congregation was also known as the German Churches, since it served both denominations. In its earliest days, the church was served by pastors connected with congregations in the <a href="Shenandoah%20Valley">Shenandoah Valley</a>. Streit incorporated the church into his <a href="Circuit%20preacher">circuit</a> shortly after its founding, regularly traveling to the Cacapon River Valley for baptisms and weddings, but his ministry did not extend west of <a href="Cooper%20Mountain%20%28West%20Virginia%29">Cooper Mountain</a>. According to the oldest extant church record, six people were <a href="confirmation">confirmed</a> in the Lutheran Synod and nine confirmed in the <a href="Reformed%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States">German Reformed Church</a> in November 1786. On September 23, 1787, seven more people were confirmed in the Lutheran Synod; the church's enrollment then began to increase.

Early religious services were held in the log church on land deeded to Reformed trustee Jacob Huber and Lutheran trustee John Nicholas Schweitzer, both of whom were church <a href="Elder%20%28Christianity%29">elders</a> in 1786. The deed conveying the land to the trustees specified that it was to be used for a German church and burial yard. The united congregation became Hebron Church, the first Lutheran church west of the Shenandoah Valley.

While the Reformed and Lutheran congregations used the log church, they were ministered by two pastors. Abraham Gottlieb Deschler ministered to the Lutherans, and Jacob Rebas (or Repass) ministered to the Reformed congregation until the latter dissolved around 1813. Although the church served both denominations, it was later served by one minister (Reformed or Lutheran). Originally a German-speaking congregation, its documents and religious services were in German until 1821 (an early transition to English for a German denomination in the United States). By that time, under the pastorship of Abraham Reck (1812–21), the congregation was known as Capon Church.

The congregation of Great Capon Church built the present one-and-a-half-story Lutheran church building in 1849, when it was briefly renamed Hebron on the Cacapon after the Scriptural <a href="Hebron">Hebron</a> (the city associated with <a href="Judah%20%28biblical%20person%29">Judah</a>, <a href="Abraham">Abraham</a>, and <a href="Isaac">Isaac</a>). The church was later known simply as Hebron Church.

The brick church was constructed east of the original log structure, which was located to the west of the present community building. The 1849 church was originally topped by a <a href="Wood%20shingle">wooden shake</a> roof, and its windows had double-hung wooden sashes. Its <a href="pew">pew</a>s were built by Alfred Brill, Jacob Himmelwright and Frederick Secrist with lumber milled by Brill. The church was constructed under the ministry of H. J. Richardson (1848–53).

The log church was moved from its original location in the south corner of the cemetery to a hill across the road from the brick church. It was used as a <a href="sexton%20%28office%29">sexton's house</a> for the church, and was a <a href="Sunday%20school">Sunday school</a> classroom for about 30 years. In addition to religious instruction, the log building was a public schoolhouse. Future West Virginia governor <a href="Herman%20G.%20Kump">Herman G. Kump</a> and his brother, the judge Garnett Kerr Kump, received part of their primary education in the schoolhouse. By 1885, a Mr. Miller was teaching business principles at the school. The log building succumbed to the elements, and no longer exists.

Peter Miller ministered to the congregation at Hebron Church four times, for a total of 25 years, between 1858 and 1918. Licensed in 1858 and ordained in 1860, Miller engaged in missionary work for rural congregants in the Capon and North River Parish of Hampshire and <a href="Hardy%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia">Hardy</a> counties for 60 years. He established many of the area's Lutheran churches and, according to the North Carolina Synod of the Lutheran Church in America, was "an outstanding figure in this large, mountainous, thinly populated territory, who for sixty years almost continuously was recognized as everybody's pastor". By 1867, the church membership was 106, its largest congregation to date.

On October 13, 1879, a post office was established near Hebron Church to serve the adjacent community (then known as Mutton Run). In December 1884, the church roof caught fire from an adjacent flue, burning a hole through the sanctuary's ceiling which was soon repaired. On August 11–15, 1886, Hebron Church celebrated its centennial. During the celebration, Miller read a complete history of the German churches in the region. The centennial was reportedly the first of any Lutheran congregation in the southern United States.

The wrought-iron fence along the church driveway was installed in April 1895, replacing a <a href="picket%20fence">picket fence</a>. In 1905, the church's wood roof was replaced with a metal one, the present stained-glass windows were installed, its interior and woodwork were painted, and new lamps were installed for better illumination. The stained-glass windows were supplied by Madison Alling of <a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Newark, New Jersey</a> in memory of his father, who summered at nearby <a href="Capon%20Springs%20Resort">Capon Springs Resort</a>. Alling also provided four hanging lamps and <a href="Whitewash">calcimine</a> for the interior walls and paint for the interior woodwork. Anton Reymann of <a href="Wheeling%2C%20West%20Virginia">Wheeling, West Virginia</a> funded the metal roof and the sanctuary's painting and decoration.

On June 11, 1915, the post office changed its name to Intermont (after the Intermountain Construction Company), operating until its closure on January 29, 1972. The unincorporated community around Hebron Church continues to be known as Intermont, after the former post office. By 1921, the <a href="Winchester%20and%20Western%20Railroad">Winchester and Western Railroad</a> had been constructed to the east of Hebron Church by the Intermountain Construction Company to connect Wardensville with Winchester and develop the area's timber, mining, and fruit industries.

In 1932, the church's piano was donated by George E. Brill of <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>. Hebron Church celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1936, during the pastorate of Lawrence P. Williamson (1930–37). On October 29, 1961, in celebration of the church's 175th anniversary, the congregation dedicated a new brick community and religious-education building designed to be architecturally compatible with the 1849 brick church. The new building, which hosted community gatherings, events and Sunday school, was built just south of the brick church at the edge of the cemetery (where the old log church was originally located). Walter A. Sigman (1960–65) was pastor when the community building was dedicated.

In 2008, a survey of historic properties in the county was undertaken by the State Historic Preservation Office of the West Virginia Division of Culture and History. Following this survey, the Hampshire County Historic Landmarks Commission and the Hampshire County Commission began an initiative to place these identified structures and districts on the National Register of Historic Places. Preparation of the necessary documentation for Hebron Church, <a href="French%27s%20Mill">French's Mill</a>, <a href="Yellow%20Spring%20Mill">Yellow Spring Mill</a>, and the <a href="Nathaniel%20and%20Isaac%20Kuykendall%20House">Nathaniel and Isaac Kuykendall House</a> began in April 2013, when Governor <a href="Earl%20Ray%20Tomblin">Earl Ray Tomblin</a> awarded $10,500 to the Hampshire County Commission. The cost of the commission's documentation of the history and significance of the four properties was $15,000, of which the county paid $4,500.

All four properties were accepted for the NRHP on December 16, 2014, with Hebron Church a unique local example of <a href="Greek%20Revival%20architecture">Greek Revival</a> church architecture in the Potomac Highlands. Because the church's original architectural design, workmanship, and building materials are extant, architectural historian Sandra Scaffidi assessed the church as providing "insight into the construction techniques of a mid-19th-century ecclesiastical building". Hebron Church is one of six extant, rural pre-Civil War church buildings in Hampshire County; the other five are Bloomery Presbyterian Church (1825), <a href="Mount%20Bethel%20Church%20%28Three%20Churches%2C%20West%20Virginia%29">Mount Bethel Church</a> (1837), <a href="Old%20Pine%20Church">Old Pine Church</a> (1838), <a href="Capon%20Chapel">Capon Chapel</a> (c. 1852), and North River Mills United Methodist Church (1860).

As of October 2015, the church's congregation is part of the Potomac Conference in the <a href="West%20Virginia-Western%20Maryland%20Synod">West Virginia-Western Maryland Synod</a> of the <a href="Evangelical%20Lutheran%20Church%20in%20America">Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</a>. Ministered by David A. Twedt, Hebron Church has 22 baptized members, 19 confirmed members and an average attendance of six.

Since the church's founding in 1786, the following pastors have ministered to the congregation at Hebron Church:

According to Sandra Scaffidi, Hebron Church's architecture exemplifies a "local interpretation" of the Greek Revival architectural style, which was popular at the time of its construction. With its simple wooden doors, returning <a href="eaves">eaves</a> and symmetrical <a href="Gablefront%20house">front gable</a> design, Hebron Church is representative of a vernacular interpretation of Greek Revival architecture. Only one other church building in eastern Hampshire County, Timber Ridge Christian Church in <a href="High%20View%2C%20West%20Virginia">High View</a>, was built of brick. The overall plan of Hebron Church exemplifies traditional Lutheranism, with the sanctuary's one-room floor plan enabling the congregation to be near its minister and easily participate in worship. Scaffidi wrote, "The Greek Revival front-gable form of the Hebron Church reflects the early settlers' desire to worship in a modest, uncluttered fashion."

The 1849 church is a small, one-and-a-half-story, front-gable building. The main façade (northwestern elevation) has two main entrances, enclosed by white-painted wood, recessed panel doors, and capped by white-painted stone <a href="lintel">lintel</a>s with two stone corner blocks. The church's exterior is <a href="brickwork">brickwork</a>, laid in <a href="Flemish%20bond">Flemish bond</a> on the main façade and a five-course <a href="American%20bond">American bond</a> on the northeastern, southeastern and southwestern elevations. Two blue-gray <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> windows (installed in 1905) are symmetrically placed above the main entrances, each capped by stone lintels with two stone corner blocks. The main façade is crowned by a white painted <a href="entablature">entablature</a> molding with two <a href="cornice%20return">cornice return</a>s, exemplifying Greek Revival architectural design. In the top of the gable, a square date stone engraved "1849" is embedded in the brickwork above a gooseneck light fixture. Although the church is now topped by a <a href="Metal%20roof">metal standing-seam roof</a>, it was originally sheathed by wooden shakes.

On the church's northeastern elevation there are three large, symmetrical stained-glass windows, each with a fixed upper sash and a lower hopper sash. Like the main façade's doorways and windows, the sills, lintels and lintel corner blocks of the stained-glass windows are white-painted stone. Below the windows is an exposed coursed-stone foundation with five tie-rod masonry <a href="anchor%20plate">anchor plate</a>s. A small brick chimney is present on this elevation. The church's southwestern elevation also has a coursed-stone foundation, with five tie-rod anchor plates, banked into the ground below three symmetrical stained-glass windows with fixed upper sashes and lower hopper sashes and encased with white-painted stone sills, lintels and lintel corner blocks. On this elevation are a small brick chimney in the roof slope and metal snowbirds along the roof line. Downspouts are located at the southern corners of the northeastern and southwestern elevations. The church's southeastern (rear) elevation has an exposed coursed-stone foundation high, due to its location on sloping ground. At the center of this elevation is a protruding, gabled brick extension for the interior <a href="altar">altar</a>, with symmetrical stained-glass windows on both sides. The gabled protrusion is capped by aluminum <a href="Flashing%20%28weatherproofing%29">flashing</a>. An 1895 wrought-iron fence encloses the property's northwestern perimeter, and a paved brick walkway provides pedestrian access from the driveway to the two main entrances.

The church interior has an open floor plan, with a sanctuary measuring wide and long. The floor plan is an open <a href="nave">nave</a>, with two aisles partitioning three sections of rectangular wooden <a href="pew">pew</a>s. Although the pews had been painted white, they have been restored to their original wood finish. The sanctuary's interior walls are plaster, and the floors are sheathed in wide wooden planks. The nave is topped by a ceiling fabricated on <a href="tongue%20and%20groove">tongue and groove</a> wooden planks painted white. Three large stained-glass windows, framed by wooden <a href="Molding%20%28decorative%29">molding</a> and recessed approximately , are symmetrically located on the northeastern and southwestern walls. The lower portion of each window contains a memorial dedication, which opens into its lower hopper sash. On the northwestern side of the interior are the two main entry doors, which access an unadorned <a href="narthex">narthex</a>. Two tapered-square <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>s support an upper gallery loft, possibly used by slaves during religious services. The gallery is fronted by a solid <a href="Baluster">balustrade</a>, accented with <a href="dentil">dentil</a> molding and recessed wooden panels.

At the southeastern end of the sanctuary, the altar is atop a <a href="decagon">decagon</a>al platform about above the floor and accessible by a pair of four-step staircases. On the elevated platform is also a table holding a Bible. A recessed rectangular <a href="apse">apse</a>, flanked by a pair of fluted, <a href="engaged%20column">engaged column</a>s, is behind the altar. A painting of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> hangs in the center of the apse, with an American flag to its immediate north. An organ and a piano are north of the altar, with a <a href="baptismal%20font">baptismal font</a> south of it. The altar platform and aisles are carpeted red. The sanctuary's northern and southern elevations exposed brick chimneys connected to gas heating units, which were installed around 1970. A brass <a href="chandelier">chandelier</a> with clear glass hurricane globes is suspended in the center of the sanctuary; on the northern and southern elevations, two brass electric lanterns are adjacent to the stained-glass windows.

The upper gallery on the northwestern side of the church is accessed by a twelve-step wooden <a href="Stairs%23Spiral%20and%20helical%20stairs">spiral staircase</a>, and has an unfinished wooden floor. Four wooden pews have white-painted sides and unfinished seats and rails. The gallery's ceiling height is about at its tallest and about at its shortest, due to the sloping wooden floor. Two stained-glass windows, which cannot be opened, are along the northwest wall. A small closet, accessible through a wooden door with two parallel vertical panels and original latch hardware, is at the base of the staircase. The church's original plasterwork and a vertically cut wooden board, suggesting <a href="Half-timbered">half-timbering</a>, are visible in the closet.

The church's community building, a non-contributing structure within the historic boundary, is southwest of the church. The building is a venue for Sunday school classes and community gatherings. The front gable building, completed in 1961, is sheathed in brickwork. Similar to the church, the building is built into a gently sloping bank with its one-story elevation at grade facing west toward WV 259. Its two-story eastern elevation is at the foot of the hillside.

The building's western façade has a central entryway with double doors, topped by a six-light <a href="transom%20%28architectural%29">transom</a> and flanked by engaged pilasters. Its gable, sheathed in aluminum siding, incorporates a gabled pediment and the building's perimeter is surrounded by a wide, flat <a href="frieze">frieze</a>. The building's southern elevation has wooden windows with 12-over-12 double-hung sashes on brick window sills. Its basement level has one entrance, flanked by wooden double-hung sash windows and four <a href="casement%20window">casement window</a>s. The northeastern elevation has three stained-glass windows on the main level, with three wooden eight-over-eight double-hung sash windows; a single wooden six-over-six double-hung sash window is in the gable. The building is roofed with asphalt shingles, and a brick chimney is along the slope of the northern elevation's roof line. Its northeastern elevation has five wooden 16-over-16 double-hung sash windows on the main level and four on the lower level, in addition to two wooden four-over-four sash windows.

Hebron Church is surrounded on three sides by a graveyard, consisting of about 700 granite, marble, slate and wooden headstones laid in semi-regular rows running northeast to southeast. The graveyard also abuts the northeastern elevation of the community building. Its interments date from about 1806 to the present; early headstones have deteriorated beyond recognition, and may be older than 1806. <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">Slaves</a> and other people of color are interred in a small area of the graveyard's southeastern section, with simpler markers than the cemetery's other headstones. Although its headstones are generally rectangular granite stones and large obelisks, the graveyard's earliest headstones were simple wooden boards. Several gravestones are ornately carved, including one modeled on a tree stump. The graveyard is active, with the most recent burials at the property's northern end. Dr. William Blum, Sr., an <a href="Electrochemistry">electrochemist</a> at the <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology">National Bureau of Standards</a> who invented a <a href="chrome%20plating">chrome plating</a> technique used in <a href="banknote">banknote</a> printing, is interred at the cemetery.

The Sirens and Ulysses

The Sirens and Ulysses is a large <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> on canvas by the English artist <a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a>, first exhibited in 1837. It depicts the scene from <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>" in which <a href="Odysseus">Ulysses</a> (Odysseus) resists the bewitching song of the <a href="Siren%20%28mythology%29">Siren</a>s by having his ship's crew tie him up, while they are ordered to block their own ears to prevent themselves from hearing the song.

While traditionally the Sirens had been depicted as human–animal <a href="chimera%20%28mythology%29">chimera</a>s, Etty portrayed them as naked young women, on an island strewn with decaying corpses. The painting divided opinion at the time of its first exhibition, with some critics greatly admiring it while others derided it as tasteless and unpleasant. Possibly owing to its unusually large size, 442.5 cm by 297 cm (14 ft 6 in by 9 ft 9 in), the work initially failed to sell, and was bought later that year at a bargain price by the <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> merchant Daniel Grant. Grant died shortly afterwards, and his brother donated "The Sirens and Ulysses" to the <a href="Royal%20Manchester%20Institution">Royal Manchester Institution</a>.

"The Sirens and Ulysses" was painted using an experimental technique, which caused it to begin to deteriorate as soon as it was complete. It was shown in a major London exhibition of Etty's work in 1849 and at the 1857 <a href="Art%20Treasures%20Exhibition%2C%20Manchester%201857">Art Treasures Exhibition</a> in Manchester, but was then considered in too poor a condition for continued public display and was placed in the gallery's archives. Restoration began on the work in 2003, and in 2010 the painting went on display in the <a href="Manchester%20Art%20Gallery">Manchester Art Gallery</a>, over 150 years after being consigned to storage.

<a href="York">York</a>-born <a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a> (1787–1849) had originally been an apprentice printer in <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>, but on completing his apprenticeship at the age of 18 moved to <a href="London">London</a> to become an artist. Strongly influenced by the works of <a href="Titian">Titian</a> and <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Rubens</a>, he became famous for painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. While many of his peers greatly admired him and elected him a full <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts%23Membership">Royal Academician</a> in 1828, others condemned the content of his work as indecent.

Throughout his early career Etty was highly regarded by wealthy lawyer Thomas Myers, who had been educated at <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a> and thus had a good knowledge of classical mythology. From 1832 onwards Myers regularly wrote to Etty to suggest potential subjects for paintings. Myers was convinced that there was a significant market for very large paintings, and encouraged Etty to make such works. In 1834, he suggested the theme of <a href="Odysseus">Ulysses</a> ("Odysseus" in the original Greek) encountering the <a href="Siren%20%28mythology%29">Sirens</a>, a scene from the "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>" in which a ship's crew sails past the island home of the Sirens. The Sirens were famous for the beauty of their singing, which would lure sailors to their deaths. Ulysses wanted to hear their song, so had his crew lash him to the ship's mast under strict orders not to untie him, after which they blocked their ears until they were safely out of range of the island.

The topic of Ulysses encountering the Sirens was well suited to Etty's taste; as he wrote at the time, "My aim in all my great pictures has been to paint some great moral on the heart ... the importance of resisting SENSUAL DELIGHTS". In his depiction of the scene, he probably worked from <a href="Alexander%20Pope">Alexander Pope</a>'s translation, "Their song is death, and makes destruction please. / Unblest the man whom music wins to stay / Nigh the curs'd shore, and listen to the lay ... In verdant meads they sport, and wide around / Lie human bones that whiten all the ground. / The ground polluted floats with human gore / And human carnage taints the dreadful shore."

"The Sirens and Ulysses" shows three Sirens singing on an island, surrounded by the rotting corpses of dead sailors. Ulysses is visible in the background tied to the mast of his ship, while dark clouds rise in the background.

Ulysses appears larger than his fellow sailors, while the Sirens hold out their arms in traditional dramatic poses. The three Sirens are very similar in appearance, and Etty's biographer Leonard Robinson believes it likely that Etty painted the same model in three different poses. Robinson considers their classical poses to be the result of Etty's lifelong attendance at the Academy's Life Classes, where models were always in traditional poses, while former curator of <a href="York%20Art%20Gallery">York Art Gallery</a> Richard Green considers their pose a tribute to the <a href="Nereid">Nereid</a>s in Rubens's "<a href="Marie%20de%27%20Medici%20cycle%23The%20Disembarkation%20at%20Marseilles">The Disembarkation at Marseilles</a>", a work Etty is known to have admired and of which he made a copy in 1823.

The physical appearance of the Sirens is not described in the "Odyssey", and the traditional Greek representation of them was as bird-lion or bird-human <a href="chimera%20%28mythology%29">chimeras</a>. Etty rationalised the fully human appearance of his Sirens by explaining that their forms became fully human once out of the sea, an approach followed by a number of later painters of the subject.

Etty put a great deal of effort into the painting, including visiting a mortuary to sketch the dead and decaying bodies on the Sirens' island. His use of real corpses became publicly known, causing complaints from some critics. Although he visited <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a> in 1836 to make studies of the sea in connection with the painting, Etty had little experience of landscape and seascape painting, and the painting of the sea and clouds is rudimentary in comparison with the rest of the work.

The painting was Etty's largest work to that time, measuring 442.5 cm by 297 cm (14 ft 6 in by 9 ft 9 in). The work was completed in 1837 and exhibited at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts">Royal Academy of Arts</a> later that year, and hung in the Academy's new building at <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a> (now the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a>). The work, and Etty's methods in making it, divided opinion: "<a href="The%20Gentleman%27s%20Magazine">The Gentleman's Magazine</a>" considered it "by far the finest [painting] that Mr. Etty has ever painted ... it is a historical work of the first class, and abounds with beauties of all kinds", while "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>" described it as "a disgusting combination of voluptuousness and loathsome putridity—glowing in colour and wonderful in execution, but conceived in the worst possible taste".
Possibly because of its size, "The Sirens and Ulysses" failed to sell at the 1837 <a href="Royal%20Academy%20summer%20exhibition">Summer Exhibition</a>. In October 1837 wealthy <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> cotton merchant Daniel Grant, an admirer of Etty who had already commissioned "<a href="Venus%20and%20her%20Doves">Venus and her Doves</a>" from him, met Etty at <a href="Heaton%20Park">Heaton Park</a> races and offered to buy "The Sirens and Ulysses" and Etty's smaller "Samson Betrayed by Delilah" unseen for a total of £200. Etty was hoping for £400 for the two paintings, but on being told by Grant that his firm had lost £100,000 that year offered a price of £300 for the pair. Grant counter-offered £250 (about £ in today's terms), which Etty refused. On leaving at the end of the evening, Grant suddenly said, "Will you take the money?", startling Etty, who in his surprise agreed. Grant died shortly afterwards, leaving the painting to his brother William, who in turn gave it to the <a href="Royal%20Manchester%20Institution">Royal Manchester Institution</a> in 1839.

Etty considered the painting to be his best work, insisting that it form the centrepiece of his 1849 <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Royal Society of Arts</a> solo exhibition. The Royal Manchester Institution was concerned that the painting would be damaged if moved, refusing to allow it to be used in the exhibition until Etty, and a number of influential friends, visited Manchester to beg them to release it. Etty died later that year, and his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity. Interest in him declined over time, and by the end of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. As it was rarely exhibited, "The Sirens and Ulysses" had little influence on later artists, although it is credited as an influence on <a href="Frederic%20Leighton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Leighton">Frederic Leighton</a>'s 1858 "<a href="The%20Fisherman%20and%20the%20Syren">The Fisherman and the Syren</a>".

Etty had used experimental techniques to make "The Sirens and Ulysses", using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused the paint to dry hard and brittle, and to flake off once dry, a problem made worse by the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 <a href="Art%20Treasures%20Exhibition%2C%20Manchester%201857">Art Treasures Exhibition</a> it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in the archives of the Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the <a href="Manchester%20Art%20Gallery">Manchester Art Gallery</a>. In the mid 20th century there were a number of unsuccessful attempts to repair "The Sirens and Ulysses", but an attempt to clean the painting unintentionally damaged the paint further.

In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff determined that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting would soon be beyond repair. The <a href="Esm%C3%A9e%20Fairbairn%20Foundation">Esmée Fairbairn Foundation</a> and <a href="AXA">AXA Art Insurance</a> provided funding for the restoration. A <a href="Lining%20of%20paintings">replacement canvas</a> to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of <a href="isinglass">isinglass</a> adhesive and chalk was used to restore the surface of the painting, and the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed. A new double layer of canvas was added to the back of the painting, and the three layers were glued together.

In 2006 the repaired painting was moved back from the conservation studios to the Manchester Art Gallery. The Gallery Nine section of the MAG was converted into a temporary studio, open to the public to watch the final retouching work until it was completed in 2010, and "The Sirens and Ulysses" currently hangs in Gallery Three.

True Detective (season 1)

The first season of "<a href="True%20Detective">True Detective</a>", an American <a href="anthology%20series">anthology</a> <a href="crime%20drama">crime drama</a> television series created by <a href="Nic%20Pizzolatto">Nic Pizzolatto</a>, premiered on January 12, 2014, on the premium cable network <a href="HBO">HBO</a>. The principal cast consisted of <a href="Matthew%20McConaughey">Matthew McConaughey</a>, <a href="Woody%20Harrelson">Woody Harrelson</a>, <a href="Michelle%20Monaghan">Michelle Monaghan</a>, <a href="Michael%20Potts%20%28actor%29">Michael Potts</a>, and <a href="Tory%20Kittles">Tory Kittles</a>. The season comprised eight episodes, and its initial airing concluded on March 9, 2014. As an anthology, each "True Detective" season has its own self-contained story, following a disparate set of characters in various settings.

Constructed as a <a href="nonlinear%20narrative">nonlinear narrative</a>, season one focuses on <a href="Louisiana%20State%20Police">Louisiana State Police</a> homicide detectives <a href="Rust%20Cohle">Rustin "Rust" Cohle</a> (McConaughey) and Martin "Marty" Hart (Harrelson), who investigated the murder of prostitute Dora Lange in 1995. Seventeen years later, they must revisit the investigation, along with several other unsolved crimes. During this time, Hart's infidelity threatens his marriage to Maggie (Monaghan), and Cohle struggles to cope with his troubled past. "True Detective" first season explores themes of philosophical <a href="pessimism">pessimism</a>, masculinity, and Christianity; critics have analyzed the show's portrayal of women, its <a href="auteur%20theory">auteurist</a> sensibility, and the influence of <a href="comics">comics</a> and <a href="Weird%20fiction">weird</a> <a href="horror%20fiction">horror fiction</a> on its narrative.

Pizzolatto initially conceived "True Detective" as a novel, but felt it was more suitable for television. The episodes, directed by <a href="Cary%20Joji%20Fukunaga">Cary Joji Fukunaga</a>, were filmed in Louisiana over a three-month period. The series received positive reviews from critics and was cited as one of the strongest dramas of the 2014 television season. It was a candidate for numerous television awards, including a <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Primetime Emmy Award</a> nomination for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Drama%20Series">Outstanding Drama Series</a> and a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a> for <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Miniseries%20or%20Television%20Film">Best Miniseries or Television Film</a>, and won several other honors for writing, cinematography, direction, and acting.

Before creating "<a href="True%20Detective">True Detective</a>", <a href="Nic%20Pizzolatto">Nic Pizzolatto</a> had taught at the <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, <a href="DePauw%20University">DePauw University</a>, and the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>. Inspired by <a href="HBO">HBO</a>'s series "<a href="The%20Wire">The Wire</a>", "<a href="The%20Sopranos">The Sopranos</a>", and "<a href="Deadwood%20%28TV%20series%29">Deadwood</a>", he began working on a short story collection that he later published as "Between Here and the Yellow Sea" in 2006. He published a novel, "Galveston", in 2010, and began trying to write for television. His earlier attempts at television writing were unsuccessful because of a lack of money. Pizzolatto's first major gig in television writing came in 2011, as a screenwriter for <a href="AMC%20%28TV%20channel%29">AMC</a>'s series "<a href="The%20Killing%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">The Killing</a>". He credits the show with giving him a glimpse of the inner workings of the television industry. Pizzolatto grew increasingly dissatisfied with the series' creative direction, and left two weeks into staff writing sessions for <a href="The%20Killing%20%28season%202%29">its second season</a>.

"True Detective" was intended to be a novel, but once the project took definite form, Pizzolatto thought the narrative's shifts in time and perspective made it more suitable for television. He pitched an adaptation of "Galveston", and from May to July 2010 he developed six screenplays, including an early, 90-page draft of the "True Detective" <a href="The%20Long%20Bright%20Dark">pilot</a> script. Pizzolatto secured a development deal with HBO for a potential pilot series shortly thereafter. He wrote a second "True Detective" script soon after his departure from "The Killing" thanks to the support of production company and manager <a href="Anonymous%20Content">Anonymous Content</a>, which ultimately produced and developed the project in-house. By April 2012, following a heated bidding period, HBO commissioned eight episodes of "True Detective". Pizzolatto did not hire a writing staff because he believed a collaborative approach would not work with his isolated, novelistic process, and that a group would not achieve his desired result. After working alone for about three months, the final copy of the project script was 500 pages long.

Because the series is an anthology, each season has a self-contained narrative, following a disparate set of characters in various settings. Pizzolatto began contemplating the lead roles while he was pitching the series to networks in early 2012. "True Detective" anthology format required actors to commit to only a single season, so Pizzolatto was able to attract film stars who normally avoid television series because of their busy schedules. <a href="Woody%20Harrelson">Woody Harrelson</a> and <a href="Matthew%20McConaughey">Matthew McConaughey</a> were among the actors Pizzolatto considered for star billing. McConaughey, who had recently finished filming "<a href="Killer%20Joe%20%28film%29">Killer Joe</a>" (2011), was contracted well before HBO commissioned the season. Impressed with his performance in "<a href="The%20Lincoln%20Lawyer%20%28film%29">The Lincoln Lawyer</a>" (2011), Pizzolatto at first assigned him to play Hart, but McConaughey convinced him to give him the part of Cohle. When asked in a "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" interview about his decision to switch parts, the actor replied, "I wanted to get in that dude's head. The obsession, the island of a man—I'm always looking for a guy who monologues. It's something really important as I feel I'm going into my better work." To prepare for the role, McConaughey created a 450-page analysis—the "Four Stages of Rustin Cohle"—to study his character's evolution during the season.

Harrelson was the season's next significant casting choice, brought on to play Hart at McConaughey's request. Harrelson stated that he joined "True Detective" partly because he wanted to work with certain people involved in the project, with whom he had previously collaborated in the 2012 HBO film "<a href="Game%20Change%20%28film%29">Game Change</a>". <a href="Michelle%20Monaghan">Michelle Monaghan</a> agreed to play the season's female lead, Maggie, because she felt compelled by the direction of the plot and her character's story arc. <a href="Michael%20Potts%20%28actor%29">Michael Potts</a> and <a href="Tory%20Kittles">Tory Kittles</a> completed the principal cast, playing detectives Maynard Gilbough and Thomas Papania, respectively. Major supporting roles in "True Detective" first season include <a href="Kevin%20Dunn">Kevin Dunn</a> as Major Ken Quesada, <a href="Alexandra%20Daddario">Alexandra Daddario</a> as Lisa Tragnetti, and <a href="Brad%20Carter">Brad Carter</a> as Charlie Lange.

Pizzolatto narrowed his search for a suitable director to <a href="Cary%20Joji%20Fukunaga">Cary Joji Fukunaga</a>, whom he knew from Anonymous Content, and <a href="Alejandro%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20I%C3%B1%C3%A1rritu">Alejandro González Iñárritu</a>. Fukunaga was formally appointed as director after Iñárritu pulled out of the project due to film commitments. In preparation for his work on the series, Fukunaga spent time with a homicide detective of the <a href="Louisiana%20State%20Police">Louisiana State Police</a>'s Criminal Investigations Division to develop an accurate depiction of a 1990s homicide detective's work. Fukunaga recruited <a href="Adam%20Arkapaw">Adam Arkapaw</a>, director of photography of "<a href="Top%20of%20the%20Lake">Top of the Lake</a>", as project cinematographer. Arkapaw came to the director's attention for his work in "<a href="Animal%20Kingdom%20%28film%29">Animal Kingdom</a>" (2010) and "<a href="Snowtown%20%28film%29">Snowtown</a>" (2011), and was hired after the two negotiated a deal at a meeting in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Alex DiGerlando, who Fukunaga had worked with on <a href="Benh%20Zeitlin">Benh Zeitlin</a> "Glory at Sea" in 2008, was appointed as the production designer. Fukunaga said in an interview, "I knew what Alex accomplished in the swamps of Louisiana and given some money, how much more amazing he could be in building sets that would just be used for one or two days and be abandoned again."

Initially, "True Detective" first season was due to shoot in <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>, but Pizzolatto later chose to film in <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> to take advantage of <a href="Film%20industry%20in%20Louisiana">state tax incentives</a> and the area's distinctive landscape: "There's a contradictory nature to the place and a sort of sinister quality underneath it all ... everything lives under layers of concealment. The woods are thick and dark and impenetrable. On the other hand you have the beauty of it all from a distance." Principal photography took three months (between 100 and 110 days), from January to June 2013. Approximately five minutes of film were shot per day. Production staff constructed various set pieces, among them a scorched chapel, Joel Theriot's <a href="tent%20revival">tent revival</a>, and the Louisiana State Criminal Investigations Division offices, the last of which they built inside an abandoned light bulb warehouse near <a href="Elmwood%2C%20Louisiana">Elmwood</a>. For the Dora Lange crime scene, the crew filmed exterior shots at a remote sugarcane field outside <a href="Erath%2C%20Louisiana">Erath</a> which, because it was partially burned, inspired what DiGerlando called a "moody and atmospheric" backdrop for the corresponding interior scenes. The scene in which Cohle, taking Ginger hostage, escapes a housing complex amidst gunfire, was captured in <a href="Bridge%20City%2C%20Louisiana">Bridge City</a> as a single six-minute <a href="tracking%20shot">tracking shot</a>, a technique Fukunaga had employed in "<a href="Sin%20Nombre%20%282009%20film%29">Sin Nombre</a>" (2009) and "<a href="Jane%20Eyre%20%282011%20film%29">Jane Eyre</a>" (2011). Shot in seven takes, preparation for the scene was extensive and demanding: McConaughey trained with Mark Norby to master a fighting style for his character, and the nature of the shoot required a team of stunt coordinators, make-up artists, and special effects crew on hand during its entire course. Elsewhere, shooting took place at the old Kenner High School campus and nineteenth-century <a href="Fort%20Macomb">Fort Macomb</a>, located outside <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>. 

The filming schedule was not organized in the episode sequence, which made managing the logistics much more challenging. The entire season was shot on <a href="35%20mm%20film">35 mm film</a>, which the production staff chose to achieve a certain texture, as well as a "nostalgic" quality. The season was filmed using a <a href="Panavision">Panavision Millennium XL2 camera</a>, and the choice of lens corresponded to the period when a scene took place. Scenes set in 1995 and 2002 were captured with Panavision PVintage lenses, which produced a softer image because they were made of recycled, low-contrast glass. As these scenes were written as a reflection of Cohle and Hart's memory, production sought to make them as cinematic as possible, to reflect what Arkapaw called "the fragmentation of their lucid imaginations back through their past." To achieve this, they relied on wider lenses to exaggerate composition. The 2012 scenes were shot with Panavision Primo lenses: the visual palette in comparison was sharper and had much more contrast, lending a "modern, crisp feeling" to the images, and, according to Arkapaw, pulling "characters out from their environments to hopefully help audiences get inside their heads."

Joshua Walsh was responsible for creating "True Detective" artwork. His work for the show consists of over 100 individual "devil's nests"—twig sculptures created by the killer—along with wall paintings and miniature sculptures of men made of beer cans, among others. According to DiGerlando, Walsh's interests in hunting and taxidermy made him "the perfect dude for the job". A blueprint for the devil's nests was not well established in the script, other than specifications that the structures be able to stand on their own and feature a spiral motif. DiGerlando and Walsh went with a tripod design that showed a spiral when viewed from the base, and contained ladder-like crossing elements that symbolized the killer's desire to ascend to a dark <a href="Plane%20%28esotericism%29">spiritual plane</a>. Each design had subtle differences from one another. DiGerlando cited the work of <a href="Henry%20Darger">Henry Darger</a> and <a href="James%20Charles%20Castle">James Charles Castle</a> as strong stylistic influences and sought a primitive look for the sculptures, one that revealed the workings of a man with "some deep inner urge to express himself". To reflect this, Walsh built devil's nests using mud, secondhand children's clothing, reeds, roots, and other materials he felt the killer would use.

The season's title sequence was a collaboration between director Patrick Clair, his <a href="Santa%20Monica">Santa Monica</a>-based studio Elastic, his <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>-based studio Antibody, and <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>-based company Breeder. The design team emphasized southern Louisiana's industrial landscape because it reflected the characters' traits and personal, inner struggles. Clair stated that from the start he had an "unusually clear" vision of "True Detective" finished opening sequence. Using <a href="Richard%20Misrach">Richard Misrach</a>'s photography book "Petrochemical America" (2012) as a template, the production team initially photographed the local scenery, and the resulting images were woven together to form the core of the title sequence. By the time production began animating, they faced several problems: the photographic stills were too grainy and the footage was too jagged. As a result, many shots were digitally altered and slowed to about a tenth of their original speed, which, according to Clair, "evoked a surreal and floaty mood that perfectly captured what we were after."

Creation of a <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> effect required the design team to use an assortment of <a href="low%20poly">low-poly meshes</a>, or 3D geometric models. Using a variety of animation and special effects techniques, these images were later <a href="superimposed">superimposed</a> "with painstaking care" to avoid a sterile, digitized look. Clair said, "The most crucial thing to me was that this didn't feel digital, so we went to great lengths to incorporate as much organic imagery as possible." For some stills, the design team created <a href="digital%20double">digital double</a>s to develop more texture. The sequence's final cut was polished using optical glitching and <a href="motion%20blur">motion distortion</a> techniques. "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" included the opening sequence in a list of ten of the best title sequences on television.

Season one's opening theme is "Far from Any Road", an <a href="alternative%20country">alternative country</a> song originally composed by <a href="The%20Handsome%20Family">The Handsome Family</a> for their 2003 album "<a href="Singing%20Bones">Singing Bones</a>". The "True Detective" soundtrack features a compilation of <a href="gospel%20music">gospel</a> and <a href="blues">blues</a> music, which were selected by Pizzolatto and <a href="T%20Bone%20Burnett">T Bone Burnett</a>. The pair opposed the use of <a href="Cajun%20music">Cajun music</a> and <a href="swamp%20blues">swamp blues</a> for the season's musical score because they felt it was overdone. Burnett said the score was intended to be character-driven, rather than inspired by other crime fiction drama. Songs by <a href="Bo%20Diddley">Bo Diddley</a>, <a href="Melvins">Melvins</a>, <a href="Primus%20%28band%29">Primus</a>, <a href="The%20Staple%20Singers">The Staple Singers</a>, <a href="Grinderman">Grinderman</a>, <a href="Wu-Tang%20Clan">Wu-Tang Clan</a>, <a href="Vashti%20Bunyan">Vashti Bunyan</a>, <a href="Townes%20Van%20Zandt">Townes Van Zandt</a>, and <a href="Captain%20Beefheart">Captain Beefheart</a> appear in season one. Burnett also composed original pieces with <a href="Rhiannon%20Giddens">Rhiannon Giddens</a>, who used a <a href="Swarmatron">Swarmatron</a> synthesizer, and <a href="Cassandra%20Wilson">Cassandra Wilson</a>. HBO released an abridged soundtrack album, featuring 14 tracks from "True Detective" first two seasons, on August 14, 2015, through physical media and <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a>.

Commentators have noted <a href="masculinity">masculinity</a> as a theme in "True Detective". Christopher Lirette of "<a href="Southern%20Spaces">Southern Spaces</a>" said the show was about "men living in a brutally masculine world" and as such, women are depicted as "things-to-be-saved and erotic obstacles" à la "<a href="Double%20Indemnity%20%28film%29">Double Indemnity</a>" (1944) and "<a href="Chinatown%20%281974%20film%29">Chinatown</a>" (1974). "<a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">Slate</a>" Willa Paskin said "True Detective" depiction of its female characters—as sex workers, the deceased, and "a nagging wife"—seemed to reveal an intent to reflect the protagonists' "blinkered worldview and the very masculine, Southern cop culture they inhabited." Some commentators saw Hart's characterization as a manifestation of this idea, evident through his conventional view of <a href="Madonna%E2%80%93whore%20complex">women as virgins and whores</a>, as well as his treatment of Maggie and Audrey. For example, when Hart confronts the two men who had sex with Audrey, he is in essence "charging other men a price for infringing on the daughter he sees, in a muddled way, as both deserving of protection and badly in need of being controlled."

In her piece for "<a href="Salon%20%28magazine%29">Salon</a>", Janet Turley said that the women "become reflections of the men", given that the "True Detective" universe is seen through the eyes of the show's male leads. Sam Adams of "<a href="Indiewire">Indiewire</a>" contended that the season's central story focused on "the horrible things men do to women", many of which are never reported to or investigated by authorities. Adams wrote, "No one missed Dora Lange. Marie Fontenot disappeared, and the police let a rumor stop them from following up". Furthermore, he said the role of women was more profound because Cohle suffers through his ex-wife and deceased daughter, and Hart is unable to "deal appropriately with the women who are there". According to Scott Wilson, a cultural studies lecturer at <a href="Kingston%20University">Kingston University</a>, women are distinguished into three groups—what he calls "the <a href="superego">superego</a>ic, the <a href="obscene">obscene</a> and the <a href="sacred">sacred</a>". Maggie, in Wilson's interpretation, is portrayed as the superegoic wife who "constantly makes demands on her guilty husband or partner tying him or her down and deflecting him or her from his symbolic role as police." 

The philosopher Erin K. Stapleton subscribes to the theory that Dora Lange's corpse serves to "provide the initial territory or orientation through which the communities of "True Detective" are formed." It is through Dora's corpse that Cohle and Hart's partnership is first clearly articulated; and in addition to their own bond, "the intimate knowledge" of her body is the basis of all of the other relationships in their respective lives. Her narrative thus, by proxy, influences both men's character development as they dive deeper into their investigation.

"True Detective" explores Christianity and the dichotomy between religion and rationality. Born into a devout <a href="Catholic">Catholic</a> household, Pizzolatto said that as a child he saw religion as storytelling that acts "as an escape from the truth". According to Andrew Romano at "<a href="The%20Daily%20Beast">The Daily Beast</a>", the season alludes to Pizzolatto's childhood and creates a parallel between Christianity and the supernatural theology of "Carcosa": "Both ... are stories. Stories people tell themselves to escape reality. Stories that 'violate every law of the universe.'" Romano believed this message is not critical of religion "per se"; rather it shows how the "power of storytelling" and religious zeal "can wind [you] up in some pretty sick places." Jeff Jensen from "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" has opined that the show becomes more self-aware through Cohle's harsh critiques of religion, which he viewed as a vehicle for commentary about pop culture escapism. Stapleton observed that the crimes on "True Detective"—through its victims and the implications of sacrifice and sexual violence—"respond to the conservative Christianity from which they originate, and seek to exploit the opportunities for the pleasure of transgression such a structure offers."

Theorist Edia Connole saw connections to <a href="Philip%20Marlowe">Philip Marlowe</a> and "<a href="Le%20Morte%20d%27Arthur">Le Morte d'Arthur</a>" <a href="Lancelot">Lancelot</a> in "True Detective" presentation of Cohle, all "knights whose duty to their liege lord is tempered with devotion to God." Other aspects of "True Detective" evoke Christian imagery, including the opening scene, which Connole felt mirrored the <a href="crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">crucifixion of Jesus</a>. The author and philosopher Finn Janning argued that Cohle's evolution illustrates an affinity between <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> and <a href="Pessimism%23philosophical%20pessimism">philosophical pessimism</a>. A self-proclaimed pessimist, Cohle is, however, changed by a <a href="near-death%20experience">near-death experience</a> in the season finale, in which he has an epiphany, seeing death as "pure love": this echoes the Buddhist concept of <a href="rigpa">rigpa</a>.

Critics have offered many readings of the influence of <a href="weird%20fiction">weird</a> and <a href="horror%20fiction">horror fiction</a> on "True Detective" narrative, often examining the influence of <a href="Robert%20W.%20Chambers">Robert W. Chambers</a>' short story collection "<a href="The%20King%20in%20Yellow">The King in Yellow</a>" (1895) and <a href="Thomas%20Ligotti">Thomas Ligotti</a>. Allusions to "The King in Yellow" can be observed in the show's dark philosophy, its recurring use of "Carcosa" and "The Yellow King" as <a href="motif%20%28narrative%29">motifs</a> throughout the series, and its symbolic use of yellow as a thematic signature that signifies insanity and decadence. Pizzolatto was accused of plagiarizing Ligotti because of close similarities between lines in "True Detective" and text from Ligotti's nonfiction book "The Conspiracy Against the Human Race" (2010)—accusations Pizzolatto denied, while acknowledging Ligotti's influence. 

Other philosophers and writers identified as influences include <a href="Arthur%20Schopenhauer">Arthur Schopenhauer</a>, <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, <a href="Gilles%20Deleuze">Gilles Deleuze</a>, <a href="Ray%20Brassier">Ray Brassier</a>, <a href="Emil%20Cioran">Emil Cioran</a>, and <a href="Eugene%20Thacker">Eugene Thacker</a>. Mathijs Peters, in a piece for "<a href="Film%20International">Film International</a>", argued that "True Detective" probes Schopenhauerian philosophy through its approach to individuality, self-denial, the battle between dark and light, and so forth. Ben Woodard noted the show's evolving philosophy, which examines a setting where culture, religion, and society are direct by-products of biological weakness. Woodward wrote, "Biological programming gets recuperated and socially redistributed visions, faiths, and acerbic personalities take the reins of uncertain ends creating a world where 'people go away'." Even the setting, Fintan Neylan argued, emphasizes a world "where the decrepitude of human ordering cannot be hidden." He stated, "This is not a place where hope fled; it is a place where hope could never take root. It is with these people and environs that the real horror is sourced." Yet Neylan observed that Cohle's actions are not motivated by <a href="misanthropy">misanthropy</a>, rather a drive to challenge "those who try to either disguise or manipulate this frailty of humans for their own benefit." And in doing so, Cohle ultimately confronts "an entire philosophical history which has taken its task as that of sweeping frailty away." <a href="Christopher%20Orr%20%28film%20critic%29">Christopher Orr</a> at "The Atlantic" said "True Detective" was "<a href="David%20Fincher">Fincherian</a> in the best sense", a fusion of "<a href="Seven%20%281995%20film%29">Se7en</a>" (1995) and "<a href="Zodiac%20%28film%29">Zodiac</a>" (2007), because of its subject matter, sleek cinematography, and "vivid, unsettling" aura.

Some commentators noted further influences from comic book literature. Adams likened Cohle to the protagonist of "<a href="Alan%20Moore%27s%20The%20Courtyard">Alan Moore's The Courtyard</a>" and drew parallels with <a href="Grant%20Morrison">Grant Morrison</a>'s "<a href="The%20Invisibles">The Invisibles</a>" for the show's brief exploration of <a href="M-theory">M-theory</a> with one of Cohle's monologues. <a href="ComicsAlliance">ComicsAlliance</a> and "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" columnist Abraham Riesman cited "<a href="Top%2010%20%28comics%29">Top 10</a>" as the inspiration for the season finale based on dialogue from the episode's closing scene.

Another principal topic of discussion among critics has been "True Detective" <a href="auteur%20theory">auteurist</a> sensibility. Auteurism (from French "<a href="%3Awikt%3Aauteur%23French">auteur</a>") is a critical framework that assesses films or other works of art as reflections of the personal vision of individual authors, typically a director or writer. At the helm of each of the season's episodes are Pizzolatto and Fukunaga—its sole writer and director—a partnership that provides the show a unique place in a traditionally collaborative medium where broad sets of writers and directors work in tandem. Colin Robertson at "<a href="The%20List%20%28magazine%29">The List</a>" saw "Twin Peaks" as the most notable artistic antecedent to "True Detective" first season, seeing that both shows challenge crime drama cliches and "use the genre conventions of a whodunnit-style mystery as a sublimely subversive diving board, and leap off from there to tell a broader story."

"True Detective" debuted to 2.3 million U.S. viewers, becoming HBO's highest rated series premiere since the <a href="Boardwalk%20Empire%20%28episode%29">pilot episode</a> of "<a href="Boardwalk%20Empire">Boardwalk Empire</a>". Ratings remained steady and peaked at the finale, which drew 3.5 million viewers. Overall, season one averaged 2.33 million viewers, and its average gross audience (which includes <a href="digital%20video%20recorder">DVR</a> recordings, reruns, and <a href="HBO%20Go">HBO Go</a> streaming) totaled 11.9 million viewers per episode, thus becoming HBO's highest rated freshman show since the first season of "<a href="Six%20Feet%20Under%20%28TV%20series%29">Six Feet Under</a>" 13 years earlier.

The American press considered "True Detective" to be among the best television shows of 2014. Many critics complimented the work of both lead actors, often singling out McConaughey for further praise, with his work described as "jaw-droppingly great" and "simply magnetic". Some reviewers singled out simple conversational scenes, often in claustrophobic interiors, as some of the best acting in the series. The characterization received mixed reviews: Cohle's speeches, described by "<a href="HuffPost">HuffPost</a>" as "mesmerizing monologues", and by "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>" as dense and interesting material, were criticized by the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" as "'70s-era psycho-babble" which slowed down the story. Several critics viewed the portrayals of women as stereotypical: "either angry or aroused", though Michelle Monaghan was praised for her performance in a "thankless role".

Pizzolatto and Fukunaga, as sole writer and director of the entire series, were able to exercise much stronger control over the show than is usual for a TV series, which let the show take risks: the pacing, dialogue, and cinematography all departed at times from the expectations for a television drama. Pizzolatto's scripts drew occasional criticism as "self-consciously literary" and overwritten, and several journalists attributed mistakes in the script to Pizzolatto's inexperience in writing TV drama. Despite the criticism, the "<a href="Daily%20Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a>" and <a href="Uproxx">Uproxx</a> described the season as "ambitious" and "dense with event and meaning". The flashback structure also divided critics: it was described as "impressively seamless", and "a major asset", but the fragmented approach to storytelling was considered a flaw by others. Uproxx praised Fukunaga's atmospheric and "hauntingly beautiful" cinematography, and "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" complimented the "spare, hollow, percussive" soundtrack, with Uproxx crediting the creative control the two men wielded for the quality of the result.

The story of two mismatched detectives working on a case was described by several critics as a cliché, though many reviewers felt this was made into a strength: "The Daily Beast", for example, described the narrative as having "the potential to be revolutionary", and the <a href="Grantland">Grantland</a> reviewer felt that "the form is truly radical and forward-thinking", though they added that "the content is anything but". Emily Nussbaum, writing for "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", was also critical, considering the real story to be "a simpler tale: one about heroic male outlines and closeups of female asses"; she described the philosophical monologues as "dorm room deep talk" and argued that the show had "fallen for its own sales pitch". Other reviewers were more positive: comments ranged from "as frighteningly nervy and furious in its delivery and intent as prime David Lynch", to "one of the most riveting and provocative series I've ever seen".

As the nominations for the <a href="66th%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">66th Primetime Emmy Awards</a> approached, early media reports named "True Detective" among several potential miniseries candidates, due to a revision made by the <a href="Academy%20of%20Television%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Television Arts & Sciences</a> that recognized film and miniseries content as distinct categories. By March 2014, HBO had submitted "True Detective" as a drama series contender, an unconventional move given the show's anthology format and fierce competition from the likes of "<a href="Breaking%20Bad">Breaking Bad</a>" and "<a href="House%20of%20Cards%20%28U.S.%20series%29">House of Cards</a>". HBO's decision was censured by <a href="FX%20%28TV%20channel%29">FX</a> president <a href="John%20Landgraf">John Landgraf</a>, who remarked to reporters at a press event: "My own personal point of view is that a miniseries is a story that ends, a series is a story that continues. To tell you the truth, I think it's actually unfair for HBO to put "True Detective" in the drama series category because essentially you can get certain actors to do a closed-ended series – a la <a href="Billy%20Bob%20Thornton">Billy Bob Thornton</a> in "<a href="Fargo%20%28TV%20series%29">Fargo</a>" or Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson in "True Detective" – who you can't get to sign on for a seven-year [regular drama series] deal." Nevertheless, "True Detective" emerged as a frontrunner heading into the Primetime Emmy season, and in July 2014, was nominated for twelve awards; its closest rival, "Breaking Bad", received sixteen nominations. The series ultimately won five Emmy awards: <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Directing%20for%20a%20Drama%20Series">Outstanding Directing</a> (Fukunaga), Outstanding Casting, Outstanding Main Title Design, Outstanding Make-Up, and Outstanding Cinematography. 

"True Detective" was a candidate for a variety of awards, most of which recognized outstanding achievement in direction, cinematography, writing, and acting. It received four <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe</a> nominations, among them for <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Miniseries%20or%20Television%20Film">Best Miniseries or Television Film</a>, and a <a href="TCA%20Award">TCA Award</a> for <a href="TCA%20Award%20for%20Program%20of%20the%20Year">Program of the Year</a>. Among the show's wins include a <a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Award">British Academy Television Award</a> (BAFTA) for <a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Award%20for%20Best%20International%20Programme">Best International Programme</a>, a <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award">Writers Guild of America Award</a> in the category, and a <a href="Critics%27%20Choice%20Television%20Award">Critics' Choice Television Award</a> for <a href="Critics%27%20Choice%20Television%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20in%20a%20Drama%20Series">Best Actor in a Drama Series</a> (McConaughey).

On June 10, 2014, HBO Home Entertainment released the first season of "True Detective" on DVD and <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray Disc</a> formats. In addition to the eight episodes, both formats contain bonus content including interviews with McConaughey and Harrelson, Pizzolatto, and composer Burnett on the show's development, "Inside the Episode" featurettes, two audio commentaries, and deleted scenes from the season. During its first week of sale in the United States, "True Detective" was the number two-selling TV series on DVD and Blu-ray Disc, selling 65,208 copies.

1804 dollar

The 1804 dollar or Bowed Liberty Dollar was a <a href="Dollar%20coin%20%28United%20States%29">dollar coin</a> struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Mint of the United States</a>, of which fifteen specimens are currently known to exist. Though dated 1804, none were struck in that year; all were minted in the 1830s or later. They were first created for use in special <a href="Proof%20coinage">proof coin</a> sets used as diplomatic gifts during <a href="Edmund%20Roberts%20%28diplomat%29">Edmund Roberts</a>' trips to <a href="Thailand">Siam</a> and <a href="Muscat%20and%20Oman">Muscat</a>.

Edmund Roberts distributed the coins in 1834 and 1835. Two additional sets were ordered for government officials in Japan and <a href="Cochinchina">Cochinchina</a>, but Roberts died in <a href="Macau">Macau</a> before they could be delivered. Besides those 1804 dollars produced for inclusion in the diplomatic sets, the Mint struck some examples which were used to trade with collectors for pieces desired for the Mint's coin cabinet. <a href="Numismatics">Numismatists</a> first became aware of the 1804 dollar in 1842, when an illustration of one example appeared in a publication authored by two Mint employees. A collector subsequently acquired one example from the Mint in 1843. In response to numismatic demand, several examples were surreptitiously produced by Mint officials. Unlike the original coins, these later restrikes lacked the correct edge lettering, although later examples released from the Mint bore the correct lettering. The coins produced for the diplomatic mission, those struck surreptitiously without edge lettering and those with lettering are known collectively as "Class I", "Class II" and "Class III" dollars, respectively.

From their discovery by <a href="Numismatist%20%28specialist%29">numismatists</a>, 1804 dollars have commanded high prices. Auction prices reached $1,000 by 1885, and in the mid-twentieth century, the coins realized over $30,000. In 1999, a Class I example sold for $4.14 million, then the highest price paid for any coin. Their high value has caused 1804 dollars to be a frequent target of counterfeiting and other methods of deception.

The <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201792">Coinage Act of 1792</a>, the legislation which provided for the establishment of the Mint of the United States (today the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a>), authorized coinage of multiple denominations of gold, silver and copper coins. According to the act, the <a href="Dollar%20coin%20%28United%20States%29">dollar</a>, or "unit", was to "be of the value of a <a href="Spanish%20milled%20dollar">Spanish milled dollar</a> as the same is now current, and to contain three hundred and seventy-one grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure, or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver". The act went on to state that the coin would be struck in an alloy consisting of 89.2 percent silver and 10.8 percent copper. The purity and weight standards outlined in the Act were based on the <a href="mean">mean</a> of several <a href="metallurgical%20assay">assays</a> conducted on Spanish milled dollars. However, the dollars were mandated by Spanish law to contain 90.2 percent silver, and most of the unworn examples in circulation in the United States at the time contained approximately more than the silver dollars authorized by the Act. In 1793, President <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> signed into law a bill which declared Spanish milled dollars legal tender, provided that they weighed no less than , which meant that at the lowest weight allowed by law, the Spanish dollars would contain approximately 0.5 percent less silver than the United States <a href="Dollar%20coin%20%28United%20States%29">dollar coins</a>. As a result, the United States silver dollars and unworn Spanish dollars were largely forced out of circulation in accordance with <a href="Gresham%27s%20law">Gresham's law</a>; the lighter Spanish dollars were shipped in quantity for circulation in the United States, while the heavier pieces would be turned in to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> to be recoined into United States coinage to take advantage of the discrepancy in weight. At that time, silver bullion was supplied to the Mint exclusively by private depositors, who, according to the Coinage Act of 1792, had the right to have their bullion coined free of charge. As large silver coins were a preferred method of commerce throughout the world, especially China, a considerable number of the United States dollars requested by silver depositors were exported to satisfy that demand.

The first dollar coins, known as <a href="Flowing%20Hair%20dollar">Flowing Hair dollar</a>s, were issued by the Mint beginning in 1794. By 1800, a majority of depositors requested their bullion be struck as silver dollars, which were then utilizing the <a href="Draped%20Bust%20dollar">Draped Bust</a> design. This contributed to a shortage of small change in circulation, and as a result, the public became increasingly critical of the Mint. <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Mint Director</a> <a href="Elias%20Boudinot">Elias Boudinot</a> began encouraging depositors to accept fractional coins, and the production of dollars began to decrease in relation to the smaller coins. Dollar coin production ceased in March 1804, although those pieces bore the date of 1803. In his 1805 report, Mint Director <a href="Robert%20Patterson%20%28educator%29">Robert Patterson</a> stated that "[t]he striking of small coins is a measure which has been adopted to accommodate the banks and other depositors, and at their particular request, both with a view of furnishing a supply of small change, and to prevent the exportation of the <a href="Commodity%20money">specie</a> of the United States to foreign countries." Though none had been struck for over two years, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> officially suspended silver dollar coinage on May 1, 1806, addressing a letter to Patterson: Sir: In Consequence of a representation from the director of the <a href="First%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">Bank of the United States</a> that considerable purchases have been made of dollars coined at the mint for the purpose of exporting them, and as it is probable further purchases and exportations will be made the President directs that all the silver to be coined at the mint shall be of small denominations, so that the value of the largest pieces shall not exceed half a dollar.

In 1832, commercial shipper <a href="Edmund%20Roberts%20%28diplomat%29">Edmund Roberts</a> began acting as an envoy to Asia on behalf of the United States government, with the intent of negotiating trade deals in the region. During his mission, he reached deals both with <a href="Said%20bin%20Sultan%2C%20Sultan%20of%20Muscat%20and%20Oman">Said bin Sultan</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Oman">Sultan of Muscat and Oman</a>, and the <a href="Phra%20Khlang">Phra Khlang</a> of <a href="Thailand">Siam</a> (modern Thailand), an important financial minister of that nation. Roberts was given items which were to be presented as gifts to the officials with whom he was negotiating, but described them as being of "very mean quality, and of inconsiderable value". After the treaties were ratified in the United States, Roberts had to return to Siam and Muscat to receive approval from the representatives of those nations. In a letter to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">Department of State</a> dated October 8, 1834, Roberts decried the gifts of his previous journey as inadequate and insulting to his hosts in the Orient. In addition to several other items, he requested a set of coins as an appropriate offering to Said bin Sultan: I am rather at a loss to know what articles will be most acceptable to the Sultan, but I suppose a complete set of new gold & silver & copper coins of the U.S. neatly arranged in a <a href="Morocco%20leather">morocco</a> case & then to have an outward covering would be proper to send not only to the sultan, but to other Asiatics. In a November 11, 1834, letter sent to Mint Director <a href="Samuel%20Moore%20%28congressman%29">Samuel Moore</a>, Secretary of State <a href="John%20Forsyth%20%28Georgia%29">John Forsyth</a> approved Roberts' suggestion, writing: The President <nowiki>[</nowiki><a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a><nowiki>]</nowiki> has directed that a complete set of the coins of the United States be sent to the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Thailand">King of Siam</a>, and another to the Sultan of Muscat. You are requested, therefore, to forward to the Department for that purpose, duplicate specimens of each kind now in use, whether of gold, silver, or copper. He also directed Moore to have two Morocco leather boxes made to house the coins. He stated that one should be yellow in color, and the other crimson, and that funds could be drawn from the Treasury for the value of the boxes and coins. Later, in a letter dated December 2, 1834, Forsyth directed Moore to include "national emblems" (including an eagle and stars) on the exterior of the cases.

In their book "The Fantastic 1804 Dollar", numismatic historians <a href="Eric%20P.%20Newman">Eric P. Newman</a> and <a href="Kenneth%20Bressett">Kenneth E. Bressett</a> assert that a problem arose at the Mint as to how to interpret Forsyth's order. As his initial correspondence indicated that the sets were to include coins of every type then in use, Mint officials included both the silver dollar and gold <a href="Eagle%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">eagle</a>. The moratorium on silver dollar coinage had been lifted in 1831, but none had been coined since those issued in March 1804. Two sets of coins, minted in <a href="Proof%20coinage">proof</a> finish, were completed and delivered along with their boxes to Roberts shortly prior to his departure on the <a href="USS%20Peacock%20%281828%29">USS "Peacock"</a> on April 27, 1835. The dollars included the sets bore the Draped Bust design, depicting an allegorical representation of <a href="Liberty%20%28goddess%29">Liberty</a> on the obverse and a heraldic eagle on the reverse. A list of diplomatic gifts was also proposed for missions to Japan and <a href="Cochinchina">Cochin-China</a> (today part of Vietnam), which included two additional sets of coins.

Roberts delivered the first set of coins to Said bin Sultan on October 1, 1835. He delivered the next set to King <a href="Nangklao">Rama III</a> of Siam the following year, on April 6. Roberts died in <a href="Macau">Macau</a> on June 12, 1836, before he could initiate contact with any other nations. On June 30, <a href="Edmund%20P.%20Kennedy">Edmund P. Kennedy</a>, commodore of the diplomatic fleet, wrote to the State Department that he had "directed that the presents [which remained ungifted due to Roberts’ death] be forwarded to the United States". The proof sets meant for Cochin-China and Japan were likely included in the shipment of returned presents. All dollars struck for inclusion in the diplomatic gift sets were likely dated 1804. It is unknown why that date was chosen for the dollars, but numismatic historian R.W. Julian suggests that it could have been done to prevent angering collectors who would not have been able to acquire the 1834-dated coin for their collections; Chief Coiner <a href="Adam%20Eckfeldt">Adam Eckfeldt</a>, after consulting with Moore, mistakenly determined that 19,570 dollars bearing the date 1804 were struck in that year. The dollars minted for the diplomatic gift sets, as well as other examples struck with the same dies, are collectively known as "Class I" 1804 dollars. In total, eight specimens of this type are known today.

During the nineteenth century, Mint employees produced unauthorized copies of medals and coins, sometimes backdated. Although coin restrikes were created openly at the Philadelphia Mint from the 1830s, the practice became clandestine by the end of the 1850s. In the decades after the first 1804 dollars were produced, collectors became aware of their existence and desired to obtain them. Several were struck at the Mint in 1858. Those coins, which became known as "Class II" 1804 dollars, had plain, unlettered edges, as opposed to standard issue Draped Bust dollars and those struck as diplomatic gifts, all of which had edge lettering applied by the <a href="Castaing%20machine">Castaing machine</a>. In 1859, <a href="James%20Ross%20Snowden">James Ross Snowden</a> unsuccessfully requested permission from the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> to create patterns and restrikes of rare coins for sale to collectors, and in that year, dealers began offering plain edge 1804 dollars to the public. At least three were offered for sale by various dealers in 1859, and coin dealer Ebenezer Locke Mason claimed that he was offered three by Theodore Eckfeldt, a Mint employee and nephew of Adam Eckfeldt (who had died in 1852). After the public became aware that Mint officials had permitted restrikes, there was a minor scandal which resulted in a Congressional investigation and the destruction of outdated coinage dies. The controversy prompted <a href="William%20E.%20DuBois%20%28assayer%29">William E. DuBois</a>, Mint Assayer, to try, in 1860, to recall the examples of the 1804 dollar in private hands. According to DuBois, five coins were known to be privately owned, of which four were recovered. He stated that three were destroyed in his presence, and one was added to the Mint's coin cabinet (of which he was curator, and which is today the <a href="National%20Numismatic%20Collection">National Numismatic Collection</a>), where it remains today. The coin, which is the sole known Class II specimen in existence, was struck over an 1857 Swiss <a href="shooting%20thaler">shooting thaler</a> minted for a <a href="Sch%C3%BCtzenfest">shooting festival</a> in the <a href="Canton%20of%20Bern">Canton of Bern</a>. The fifth coin, alluded to by DuBois, is not currently accounted for, although its edge may have been lettered after its recovery in an attempt to pass it as an original. Coins with added lettering are known as "Class III" 1804 dollars. The <a href="Obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> coinage die used to strike the Class II and Class III 1804 dollars was deposited in safekeeping in 1860, and the reverse die was destroyed in that year. The obverse die was defaced in 1869.

Class III dollars are identical to the Class II dollar, except lettering similar to that on the Class I dollars was applied to the edge of the coins. Based on the slightly concave appearance of the Class III dollars, it is likely that all were given edge lettering at some point after striking; as the Castaing machine was meant to be used prior to striking, its improper use resulted in a deformation of the coin surface. Newman and Bressett assert that they were struck at approximately the same time as the Class II dollars, and that the edges were lettered and the coins concealed by Mint employees until 1869, when one was offered to a coin collector, who rejected it as a restrike. However, numismatist S. Hudson Chapman believed that some Class III dollars were struck as late as 1876. In 1875, several were sold by Philadelphia coin dealer John W. Haseltine. Six specimens of the Class III dollar are known today.

Collectors first became aware of the existence of the 1804 dollar in 1842, when a <a href="pantograph">pantograph</a> reproduction of one specimen was featured in "A Manual of Gold and Silver Coins of All Nations", a work authored by Mint employees <a href="Jacob%20R.%20Eckfeldt">Jacob R. Eckfeldt</a> and William DuBois. The first private collector to obtain an example was Matthew A. Stickney, who acquired the coin from the Mint on May 9, 1843, by trading certain rare coins from his collection, including a unique early United States <a href="Immune%20Columbia">Immune Columbia</a> coin struck in gold. Interest in coin collecting and the 1804 dollars began increasing, and by 1860, the dollars saw extensive coverage by numismatists. In 1885, auctioneer W.E. Woodward described the 1804 dollar as "the king of coins", a moniker which it maintains today. Numismatic historian <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> asserts that the 1804 dollar has attracted more attention than any other coin. All fifteen extant specimens are acknowledged and studied by numismatists. They are identified by nicknames based on prominent owners, or the first individuals known to have possessed the coins.

At the 1962 <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a> convention, British numismatist David B. Spink announced that he was in possession of a theretofore unknown 1804 dollar specimen. The coin was housed in a yellow leather case embossed with an eagle and other ornamentation, conforming to the description of that made for the King of Siam. The set consisted of a <a href="Half%20cent%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half cent</a>, <a href="Cent%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">cent</a>, <a href="Dime%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">dime</a>, <a href="Quarter%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">quarter</a>, <a href="Half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollar</a>, dollar, <a href="quarter%20eagle">quarter eagle</a>, <a href="half%20eagle">half eagle</a> and <a href="Eagle%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">eagle</a>. As all of the coins in the set were dated 1834 with the exception of the dollar and eagle, it provided the first definitive proof that an 1804 dollar was included in the diplomatic presentation sets. According to Spink, the set was offered to him by two women whom he believed were descendants of <a href="Anna%20Leonowens">Anna Leonowens</a>, tutor of the children of <a href="Mongkut">Rama IV</a> (half-brother and heir of Rama III) and fictionalized protagonist of the <a href="Rodgers%20and%20Hammerstein">Rodgers and Hammerstein</a> musical "<a href="The%20King%20and%20I">The King and I</a>".

The fact that no 1804 dollars were struck in 1804 was not widely accepted by numismatists until the early twentieth century. Before such time, the actual year in which they were struck remained contentious among numismatists. Early on, collectors assumed that the 1804 dollars were struck in 1804, and their rarity was explained by various theories. The bulk of the mintage was variously rumored to have been paid to <a href="Barbary%20pirates">Barbary pirates</a> as ransom, lost at sea en route to China, and melted before leaving the Philadelphia Mint. In 1867, numismatist W. Elliot Woodward acknowledged that 1804 dollars were struck as diplomatic gifts in 1834, but he also believed that others were struck in 1804. Numismatists Lyman H. Low and William T. R. Marvin, writing for the "American Journal of Numismatics" in 1899, stated that "the journal confidently asserts that there is no dollar dated 1804 which was struck in that year by the U.S. Mint." In 1891, numismatist John A. Nexsen wrote that the Class I 1804 dollars were "without doubt coined in 1804". In 1905, he recanted his earlier assertions, stating that "no one now believes that they were coined in 1804."

According to Newman and Bressett, the manner in which the 1804 dollars were produced is proof that none were struck in 1804. They note that the Castaing machine's edging dies utilized an 'H' that was undersized in relation to the other letters, the same as those used on Draped Bust dollars throughout the regular production of those coins. However, the edge lettering on all Class I 1804 dollars is deformed and partially obliterated, meaning that they were not struck in an open-collared coinage press as was used in 1804, but one which used a steel collar that was not introduced to the Mint until 1833. The deformation of the edge lettering was caused by pressure pushing the coinage metal against the steel collar containing the coin blank. Additionally, many 1804 dollars were struck in proof finish, a technique which was first employed at the Mint in 1817.

From the time numismatists became aware of 1804 dollars, they have commanded high prices, both in relation to their face value and the numismatic value of other silver dollars. Some early examples were maintained in the Mint's coin cabinet for use in trades, and in 1859, dealers began offering Class II dollars priced at $75, while Theodore Eckfeldt reportedly offered a Philadelphia coin dealer three coins for $70 each. In 1883, a Class III dollar was reportedly purchased in Vienna for $740, and a Class I specimen was auctioned for $1,000 in 1885 by Henry and Samuel H. Chapman. In 1903, an example sold for $1,800, and the same coin reportedly sold for $4,250 in 1941. In 1960, a Class III dollar fetched $28,000 at an auction conducted by Stack's, a coin firm, and the same coin reached $36,000 at another Stack's sale in 1963. A Class I specimen brought $77,500 at a 1970 Stack's auction, and during a 1980 rise in coin prices, a Class III example sold for $400,000 by Bowers and Ruddy Galleries. A Class I example reached $990,000 at a Superior Galleries auction in 1990, and an example once owned by coin collector <a href="Louis%20Eliasberg">Louis Eliasberg</a> became the first 1804 dollar to surpass $1 million at auction, selling for $1,815,000 at a sale conducted by Bowers and Merena, Inc., in 1997.

The price reached an all-time high in 1999, when the finest known specimen, <a href="Coin%20grading">graded</a> Proof-68 by the <a href="Professional%20Coin%20Grading%20Service">Professional Coin Grading Service</a>, which is believed to have been the example presented to Said bin Sultan, was auctioned by Bowers and Merena for $4,140,000. At the time of the sale, this was the highest price paid for any coin. In 2008, a Class I example was sold by <a href="Heritage%20Auctions">Heritage Auctions</a> for $3,737,500, and a Class III was sold by the same firm for $2,300,000 in 2009.

Counterfeits and spurious reproductions of the 1804 dollar have been created since numismatists became aware of the coins' high value. James A. Bolen, a medallist and coin collector who created copies of valuable coins between 1862 and 1869, fabricated an 1804 dollar by altering the last digit in the date of a genuine 1803 example. Although Bolen added his name to the edge of the coin, other forgers created altered date coins with the intent to deceive. Nineteenth-century stage actor <a href="John%20T.%20Raymond">John T. Raymond</a> purchased a specimen of the coin, which was later revealed to be a forgery, for $300. All silver dollars dated between 1800 and 1803 were subject to alteration to 1804 dollars, but 1801 was the date most commonly used for that purpose.

In addition to altered dates, <a href="electrotype">electrotype</a>s of the 1804 dollar were created, both for the purposes of study and fraud. One such coin in the collection of the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a> was described by them as genuine from 1887 to 1927. Electrotypes were also created by Mint employees, and one was used as the basis for the pantograph reproductions which appeared in Eckfeldt and DuBois' 1842 "A Manual of Gold and Silver Coins of All Nations".

More modern replicas, known as "Saigon copies", were commonly offered as original at low prices to American soldiers during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. In <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20City">Saigon</a> and other <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a>ese cities, as well in nearby Thailand, military personnel were offered the copies by vendors who sometimes claimed that they were family heirlooms. In 2012, Professional Coin Grading Service founder David Hall stated that counterfeit 1804 dollars had been available in Hong Kong for decades.

The Blue Flame (play)

The Blue Flame is a four-<a href="act%20%28drama%29">act</a> <a href="Play%20%28theatre%29">play</a> written by George V. Hobart and <a href="John%20Willard%20%28playwright%29">John Willard</a>, who revised an earlier version by Leta Vance Nicholson. In 1920, producer <a href="Albert%20H.%20Woods">Albert H. Woods</a> staged the play on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> and on tour across the United States. Ruth Gordon, the main character, is a religious young woman who dies and is revived by her scientist fiancé as a soulless <a href="femme%20fatale">femme fatale</a>. She seduces several men and involves them in crimes, including drug use and murder. In the final act, her death and <a href="Resurrection%23Technological%20resurrection">resurrection</a> are revealed to be a <a href="Dream%20sequence">dream</a>. The production starred <a href="Theda%20Bara">Theda Bara</a>, a popular <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a> actress who was known for playing similar roles in movies.

Critics panned the play, ridiculing the plot, <a href="dialogue">dialogue</a>, and Bara's acting. Theater historian <a href="Ward%20Morehouse">Ward Morehouse</a> called it "one of the worst plays ever written". Bara's movie fame drew large crowds to theaters, and the play was a commercial success, breaking attendance records at some venues. Ruth Gordon was Bara's only Broadway role, and "The Blue Flame" was one of her last professional acting projects.

In the first act, irreligious scientist John Varnum has developed a device to bring the recently dead back to life. His sweet, religious fiancée, Ruth Gordon, does not approve of his experiments and hopes to reform him. When she is <a href="Lightning%20strike%23Injuries">struck by lightning</a> and killed, she becomes the first person to be revived by his machine. Before she is reanimated, the audience sees her <a href="soul">soul</a> visibly leave her body as the "blue flame" of the title. With no soul, the revived Ruth has an entirely different personality. Upon waking, she asks John for a kiss, then suggests they marry immediately so they can begin having sex.

In the second and third acts, Ruth seduces a young man named Larry Winston and steals him away from his fiancée. She takes Larry to New York's <a href="Chinatown%2C%20Manhattan">Chinatown</a>, where she gets him hooked on <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a> and steals an emerald from an idol. She meets another young man, Ned Maddox, whom she seduces and kills for insurance money, framing another man for the murder. In the final act, Ruth's death and revival is revealed to be a <a href="Dream%20sequence">dream</a> John was having. Upon waking he understands the importance of the soul; he embraces religion and destroys his life-restoration device.

The characters and cast from the Broadway production are listed below:

Leta Vance Nicholson, a movie <a href="scenario%20writer">scenario writer</a>, wrote the first version of "The Blue Flame". She sold it to theatrical agent Walter C. Jordan, who had it rewritten by George V. Hobart and John Willard. Jordan paid the three writers $10,000 for their work (about $ in dollars), then resold the play to producer Albert H. Woods for $35,000.

Actress Theda Bara was one of the most popular stars of <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a>s. From her first leading role as "the Vampire" in the 1915 movie "<a href="A%20Fool%20There%20Was%20%281915%20film%29">A Fool There Was</a>", Bara had been <a href="Typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecast</a> as a "vamp" or <a href="femme%20fatale">femme fatale</a> who seduced and ruined innocent men. Although she sometimes performed in films playing other types of roles, these were not as successful commercially as her "vamp" films. She played dozens of similar roles while contracted with <a href="Fox%20Film">Fox Film</a> from 1915 to 1919.

After Bara's contract with Fox ended, Woods approached her about appearing in a play. She had performed on stage early in her career, working with touring companies and in <a href="summer%20stock">summer stock</a>, but had not performed on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a>. Bara told a reporter that she was offered a few scripts to consider, and chose "The Blue Flame" (at that time titled "The Lost Soul") because it allowed her to play two versions of the character, one good and the other bad. She also hoped moving to the stage would bring her new career opportunities. Woods gave Bara a lucrative contract. Each week she received a salary of $1500. This was considerably less than the $4000 per week she had earned in her last year with Fox, but Bara was also promised half the production's net profits. For example, the play's two-week run in Boston netted Bara $10,700. Woods also provided a finely appointed <a href="private%20railroad%20car">private railroad car</a> to take her from city to city when the show toured.

Woods hired two directors, <a href="J.%20C.%20Huffman">J. C. Huffman</a> and W. H. Gilmore, to assist with the production. The production began with a series of <a href="Preview%20%28theatre%29">preview</a> performances in February 1920, appearing in <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>; <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>; <a href="Stamford%2C%20Connecticut">Stamford, Connecticut</a>; and <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>. The final performances before the Broadway premier were in <a href="Boston">Boston</a> in early March.

While the show was still in previews, writer <a href="Owen%20Davis">Owen Davis</a> claimed the story had been lifted from his earlier play "Lola", which had appeared briefly on Broadway in March 1911, then was adapted as a movie in 1914. He filed a lawsuit, but by the end of May it was settled with a cash payment to Davis.

The show opened on Broadway at the <a href="Shubert%20Theatre%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Shubert Theatre</a> on March 15, 1920. It had a run of 48 performances and closed in late April. The show then continued to other cities on tour. The play was further promoted by the release of sheet music for a theme song, with Bara's image featured prominently on the cover. William Frederic Peters wrote the music and <a href="Ballard%20MacDonald">Ballard MacDonald</a> wrote the lyrics for the song, which was published in April by <a href="Shapiro%2C%20Bernstein%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Shapiro, Bernstein & Co.</a>

The tour closed on January 1, 1921. "The Blue Flame" was Bara's last Broadway performance and her last acting tour. She did a season of <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> touring, but did not act in it; instead she talked with audiences and told stories about her career. Her only subsequent stage acting was in a <a href="Little%20Theatre%20Movement">Little Theatre</a> production of "Bella Donna" in 1934. Bara's film career was also waning. She acted in only one feature film after "The Blue Flame" ended, the 1925 drama "<a href="The%20Unchastened%20Woman">The Unchastened Woman</a>".

The play received overwhelmingly negative reviews, although some critics had minor compliments for Bara. Biographer <a href="Eve%20Golden">Eve Golden</a> described the reviews of Bara's acting as "nothing less than vicious", but the commentary about the play as a whole was even more negative. "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" expected Bara to draw audiences to the theater for at least a few weeks, but said opinions in the daily press were united about how bad the play was. In "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Alexander%20Woollcott">Alexander Woollcott</a> mocked the dialogue, which included lines such as, "Have you brought the cocaine?" and "You make my heart laugh and I feel like a woman of the streets." Delivered seriously, this dialogue drew laughter from the audience. Woollcott highlighted one particular line: "I'm going to be so bad, I'll be remembered always." He said Bara was bad, but not bad enough to be memorable. He credited her for speaking clearly and for not losing her composure when the audience laughed at her. Other reviewers gave Bara similarly faint praise: she had "average competence" or "was not so bad". Some complimented her looks or her glamorous wardrobe.

Other reviewers were even more negative, condemning Bara along with the play generally. The theater critic for "<a href="Munsey%27s%20Magazine">Munsey's Magazine</a>" quoted several negative reviews and compared Bara's acting unfavorably to that of <a href="drama%20school">drama school</a> students. The "<a href="Brooklyn%20Eagle">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</a>" said she fulfilled the promise to be unforgettably bad, calling her acting "freakish". "The Sun and New York Herald" said Bara's acting was disappointing and the play was "abysmal in intelligence and all that touches the art of the theatre". In "<a href="Ainslee%27s%20Magazine">Ainslee's Magazine</a>", <a href="Dorothy%20Parker">Dorothy Parker</a> said the play's authors had taken the line about being remembered for badness "as their working motto", and suggested the crowds at the performances were there to attack the playwrights. In the "<a href="New-York%20Tribune">New-York Tribune</a>", <a href="Heywood%20Broun">Heywood Broun</a> suggested that the entire production company should fear the wrath of God for such a terrible play.

Historians and critics looking back on the play have affirmed the negative assessment. Biographer Ronald Genini called the play "painfully bad" and described the reviews as "a panning orgy". Theater historian <a href="Ward%20Morehouse">Ward Morehouse</a> described it as "one of the worst plays ever written". Literary critic <a href="Edward%20Wagenknecht">Edward Wagenknecht</a> said Bara's participation helped end her acting career. Golden wondered why Bara took the role, speculating that only "desperation and incredibly poor judgement" could have explained her participation.

Overall the play was a tremendous financial success; the previews broke attendance records. In Boston, the show sold out even after the addition of extra matinées. The first week on Broadway took in nearly $20,000, close to the maximum the Shubert Theatre could generate at normal prices. However, ticket sales fell off rapidly following the strongly negative reviews. Woods pre-sold four weeks of tickets to local ticket brokers, which helped the box office totals, but the brokers were left with unsold seats even after offering deep discounts. After leaving New York, the show returned to strong sales on the road.

William Henry Harrison 1840 presidential campaign

In 1840, <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> was elected <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>. Harrison, who had served as a general and as <a href="United%20States%20Senator">United States Senator</a> from Ohio, defeated the incumbent president, <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a>, in a campaign that broke new ground in American politics. Among other firsts, Harrison's victory was the first time the <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a> won a presidential election. A month after taking office, Harrison died and his running mate <a href="John%20Tyler">John Tyler</a> served the remainder of his term, but broke from the Whig agenda, and was expelled from the party.

Harrison was born into wealth in 1773. He started a military career before using <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison%20V">his father's</a> connections to gain office on the frontier. After a decade as governor of <a href="Indiana%20Territory">Indiana Territory</a>, Harrison made his reputation fighting the Native Americans, notably at the 1811 <a href="Battle%20of%20Tippecanoe">Battle of Tippecanoe</a> and, once the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a> began, the British. He was triumphant over both at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Thames">Battle of the Thames</a> in 1813. After the war, he was elected to Congress from Ohio and served in a variety of federal offices over the next two decades. A regional Whig candidate for the White House in 1836, he finished second to Van Buren and did not stop running for president until he won the office four years later.

One of three presidential candidates at the December <a href="1839%20Whig%20National%20Convention">1839 Whig National Convention</a>, Harrison gained the nomination over <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> and General <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a> on the fifth ballot. At home, far from the convention in an era of primitive communications, Harrison played no part in the selection of Tyler as running mate. After the convention, a Democratic paper in Baltimore suggested that if offered a pension and some <a href="hard%20cider">hard cider</a> to drink in a <a href="log%20cabin">log cabin</a>, Harrison would turn aside from his campaign. The Whigs adopted the cabin and cider as emblems, both of which were commonly seen (and, in the case of cider, drunk) at their rallies, and became symbolic of the party's connection with the <a href="grass%20roots">grass roots</a>. Harrison rallies grew to unprecedented size, and the candidate made speeches to some of them, breaking the usual custom that the office should seek the man and presidential hopefuls should not campaign.

The carnival atmosphere attracted many voters at a time when there was little public entertainment, and the Whig ticket won easy majorities in both the popular and electoral vote. Harrison was inaugurated in March 1841; his death a month later marked the first time an American president had failed to complete his term. While some historians view Harrison's victorious campaign askance because of the role emotion played in it, others note how it originated techniques used in later presidential races. The unofficial campaign motto, "<a href="Tippecanoe%20and%20Tyler%20Too">Tippecanoe and Tyler Too</a>", has been called the most famous presidential campaign slogan in American history.

<a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> was born on February 9, 1773 on <a href="Berkeley%20Plantation">Berkeley Plantation</a> in <a href="James%20City%20County%2C%20Virginia">James City County, Virginia</a>. His father was the wealthy and influential <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison%20V">Benjamin Harrison</a>, a <a href="List%20of%20signers%20of%20the%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">signer of the Declaration of Independence</a> and <a href="Governor%20of%20Virginia">Governor of Virginia</a>. Houseguests at Berkeley while Harrison was a child included <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> and <a href="Patrick%20Henry">Patrick Henry</a>. Harrison was sent to <a href="Hampden-Sydney%20College">Hampden-Sydney College</a> in 1787, where he developed a lifelong interest in Roman history, and then to Philadelphia to study medicine with Dr. <a href="Benjamin%20Rush">Benjamin Rush</a>.

Benjamin Harrison died in 1791. William Henry dropped the study of medicine and used Benjamin's connections with the <a href="Founding%20Fathers">Founding Fathers</a> to get a commission in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">Army</a>. The seat of the federal government was then in Philadelphia, and President Washington granted him a commission. Harrison served under <a href="Mad%20Anthony%20Wayne">Mad Anthony Wayne</a>, fighting against Native Americans in what is now western Ohio. He was promoted to captain and made commander of <a href="Fort%20Washington%20%28Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio%29">Fort Washington</a> before returning to civilian life in 1798, disliking garrison duty. He was already seeking another position through his government connections, and the same year was appointed by President <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a> as secretary of the <a href="Northwest%20Territory">Northwest Territory</a>. The following year, the territorial legislature narrowly elected him the territory's delegate to Congress. In 1800, the <a href="Indiana%20Territory">Indiana Territory</a> was separated from the Northwest, and Harrison was made territorial governor by President Adams, a position he would hold for over a decade. Prior to taking office, he bought a large tract of land from <a href="John%20Cleves%20Symmes">his father-in-law</a>, along the Ohio River at <a href="North%20Bend%2C%20Ohio">North Bend</a>. When Harrison purchased it, there was a <a href="log%20cabin">log cabin</a> on the property, but by 1840 the structure had been absorbed into the mansion that stood there.

On the instructions of the presidents he served under, Governor Harrison secured as much land as he could from the Indians for white settlement, sometimes loaning chiefs money and taking the land when they could not repay, or finding compliant "leaders" when chiefs would not sell. This led to increased tensions between natives and settlers. In late 1810, one of the Indian leaders, <a href="Tecumseh">Tecumseh</a> came to confront Harrison at the territorial capital of <a href="Vincennes%2C%20Indiana">Vincennes</a>, telling the governor there could be no more land taken. The meeting ended badly, and Tecumseh began gathering warriors at <a href="Prophetstown%20State%20Park">Prophetstown</a>. After there were raids, Federal authorities gave Harrison permission to destroy that settlement, and in late 1811, with Tecumseh away recruiting, Harrison led about 1,000 federal troops and Kentucky militia on a march to there.

On the night of November 6, 1811, Harrison's troops camped on a ridge overlooking Prophetstown. The Indians attacked before dawn. The Americans, though taken by surprise, repelled the attack after two hours in what came to be called the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tippecanoe">Battle of Tippecanoe</a> and proceeded to destroy Prophetstown. Harrison's forces suffered heavy casualties, which did not stop him from quickly becoming known as the "Hero of Tippecanoe".
Once the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a> began, the Indians allied with the British. Harrison remained in the West (resigning as governor to accept a military commission in 1812), but was unable to make much headway against the alliance due to British naval superiority on <a href="Lake%20Erie">Lake Erie</a>. Once those ships were defeated by Commodore <a href="Oliver%20Hazard%20Perry">Oliver Hazard Perry</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lake%20Erie">Battle of Lake Erie</a> (1813), Harrison attacked his foes, and in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Thames">Battle of the Thames</a> on October 5, 1813 in present-day Ontario, Harrison's troops won the day. Tecumseh was killed and U.S. control of Detroit (which Harrison had taken from the retreating British) was not threatened in the remainder of the war. Harrison was hailed as a hero by many. Even so, his military record was quickly contentious, as some castigated him for not ordering that a <a href="palisade">palisade</a> be built around his camp at Tippecanoe, which would have made it more difficult for the Indians to take his forces by surprise, and his record remained controversial in 1840.

Harrison's military career was an asset to him in his postwar political ventures. He was elected to Congress from Ohio in 1816 to fill a vacancy, subsequently winning a full two-year term. He served a brief term in the U.S. Senate, but also failed in two other bids for the House of Representatives and one for Governor of Ohio. In 1828, President <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a> appointed him minister to <a href="Gran%20Colombia">Gran Colombia</a>, but he was recalled as <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> instituted his "<a href="spoils%20system">spoils system</a>" the following year.

Harrison lost a bid for Senate in 1831, and found insufficient support to mount a run for the House of Representatives in 1832. His large family gave him money problems, and he remained out of public life in the early 1830s. By 1834, opposition to President Jackson was coalescing into what became known as the <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a>. Harrison, though several years out of active politics was a war hero with roots in both North and South, and had been fired by Jackson. Thus, he looked attractive as a possible presidential candidate to the new party, something that Harrison did nothing to discourage. Harrison wrote a letter to the newspapers that won over many Whigs, assuring them of his fidelity to party principles, such as the limited power of the executive and federal subsidies for roads, canals and railroads.

The Whig Party was still seeking to build its state organizations, and seeing little chance of winning the presidency in 1836, ran regional candidates for president. The plan was that a presidential candidate who was popular locally, even if he did not win, might boost the Whig vote for state offices. Some hoped the group of candidates might deny Jackson's chosen successor, Vice President <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a> a majority in the <a href="Electoral%20College">Electoral College</a>. Harrison was known by then more as a war hero than as a politician, as memories of his time in Congress had faded. As state Whig parties chose their presidential candidates by convention or caucus, the other major Whig presidential candidate from the North, Massachusetts Senator <a href="Daniel%20Webster">Daniel Webster</a> was defeated by Harrison in most states, eventually getting to run only in his home state. Harrison made a trip from Ohio to Virginia, ostensibly to visit relatives, resulting in a long series of receptions and dinners. Harrison gave speeches, but as these were nominally in thanks for his welcome, they did not violate the custom at the time that the office should seek the man, and that presidential candidates should not indulge in electioneering. Harrison was the leading Whig candidate in the 1836 election, taking 7 states and 73 electoral votes, but he and the other two popular-vote candidates (Webster and <a href="Hugh%20Lawson%20White">Hugh Lawson White</a> of Tennessee) could not stop Van Buren from winning a majority in the Electoral College.

After the 1836 election, Harrison did not really stop running for president, nor did his supporters stop boosting him—an Ohio political convention endorsed him as early as 1837. His finances were somewhat secured by his appointment as clerk of <a href="Hamilton%20County%2C%20Ohio">Hamilton County's</a> circuit court, a post that paid no salary, but allowed considerable income from fees. The years between 1838 and 1840 were years of personal tragedy for the general, as three of his adult children died and his wife <a href="Anna%20Harrison">Anna</a> fell seriously ill. Harrison did his best to manage a network of acquaintances and supporters from his home in North Bend, corresponding extensively and seeking to have items favorable to him placed in the newspapers.
The <a href="Panic%20of%201837">Panic of 1837</a> and the depression that followed caused many to blame Van Buren and his <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> for the hard times, making it more likely that the Whig nominee in 1840 would be the next president. In addition to Harrison and Webster, Senator <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> of Kentucky sought the nomination, as did General <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a>. Some Whigs argued that because the depression was driving many to their ranks, there was no need to nominate a relative outsider such as Harrison; the party could win behind one of its statesmen, Clay or Webster, and by 1838, Clay was the frontrunner. A slaveholder, he commanded the near-united support of the South, though this came at the price of alienating many Northern Whigs. There was wide consensus in the party that a national convention was needed to decide on a presidential candidate, and in late 1837, the Whig congressional caucus agreed to work with the state parties to organize a convention. After considerable maneuvering, a convention to nominate candidates for president and vice president was called by the congressional caucus in May 1838, to be held at <a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Harrisburg, Pennsylvania</a> beginning on December 4, 1839. Having failed to gain much support, Webster dropped out of the race in June 1839.

The <a href="1839%20Whig%20National%20Convention">Whig National Convention</a> opened on December 4, 1839, almost a year before the general election. The candidates did not travel to the convention, and with no telegraph yet in operation, they did not learn of events in Harrisburg until the convention was over. Each state was allocated two delegates for each member of the House of Representatives and Senate it was entitled to send to Washington. There were four absent states from the South, which hurt Clay. The rules of the convention, once passed by the delegates, also hurt Clay, since they provided that the entirety of a state's vote would be cast as a majority of the delegation directed, negating Clay's sizable minorities in Northern states such as New York. That state's delegation was run by its Whig <a href="political%20boss">boss</a>, <a href="Thurlow%20Weed">Thurlow Weed</a>, who deemed Clay unelectable as a slaveholder. New York provided much of Scott's vote through the first four ballots, which were deadlocked, with Clay ahead but not close to a majority. Pennsylvania's <a href="Thaddeus%20Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a>, a leader of the Harrison forces, had obtained possession of a letter Scott had written expressing sympathy for <a href="abolitionist">abolitionist</a>s. Stevens intentionally dropped the letter while walking among the pro-Clay Virginia delegation. After reading it, the Virginians announced Harrison was their second choice, setting off a stampede for him, and he became the Whig nominee for president on the fifth ballot.

Harrison's convention managers sought a Southerner as vice presidential candidate, to balance the ticket. Clay disciples such as <a href="John%20M.%20Clayton">John M. Clayton</a> of Delaware, <a href="Willie%20Mangum">Willie Mangum</a> of North Carolina and Virginia's <a href="Benjamin%20Watkins%20Leigh">Benjamin Watkins Leigh</a> were discussed, but all of Clay's close associates refused or were believed to be unwilling to run. Former senator <a href="John%20Tyler">John Tyler</a> of Virginia, a onetime Democrat who had broken with Jackson over <a href="states%27%20rights">states' rights</a>, had been a regional Whig candidate for vice president in 1836, and had supported Clay at the convention. Harrison, out of communication in distant North Bend, was not consulted. Weed's assistant, <a href="Horace%20Greeley">Horace Greeley</a>, later claimed Tyler had wept at Clay's defeat, and this had gotten him the nomination. The vote was unanimous, but Virginia's ballots were not cast. Diarist <a href="Philip%20Hone">Philip Hone</a>, following President Harrison's death after a month in office in 1841, would write of Tyler's nomination, "there was rhyme, but no reason to it". Michael F. Holt, who in his history of the Whig Party chronicled President Tyler's departure from it, noted, "the choice of Tyler would later prove to be a disaster".

For the remainder of the convention, delegates continued to try to conciliate the Clay supporters. A number of speeches were made in tribute to the Kentucky senator, and attendees roared with approval when a pre-written letter from Clay was read, expressing support for the nominee, whoever it might be. The magnanimous tone of the letter contrasted with Clay's reaction when on December 8, the day after the convention closed, he became the first Whig presidential hopeful to learn the outcome: "My [political] friends are not worth the powder and shot it would take to kill them."

The state-by-state roll call was printed in the "Farmer's Cabinet" newspaper on December 13, 1839:

Harrison accepted his nomination in a letter dated December 19, 1839. At age 66 then (67 by the election), he was the oldest presidential candidate to that point. He pledged to serve only one term, but was vague about other stances, writing that his public career made stating his positions unnecessary. There was no <a href="party%20platform">party platform</a>; most Whigs did not favor binding candidates to a legislative plan. If the Whigs did not leave Harrisburg completely united, they achieved this within weeks of the convention. A testimonial dinner to Senator Clay in Washington on December 11, attended by convention delegates and other politicians, healed many wounds, and a series of huge public meetings, held to ratify the nominations of Harrison and Tyler, showed the Whigs willing to put the nomination fight behind them.

The Democratic press was unimpressed by Harrison's nomination, and attacked him for not publishing his views on the main issues of the day, dubbing him "General Mum". The "<a href="New%20York%20Herald">New York Herald</a>" mocked the aging general, "Mrs. Harrison of Ohio is undoubtedly a very excellent matron for her time, but if we must take a woman president, let's have youth and beauty, and not age and imbecility." <a href="John%20de%20Ziska">John de Ziska</a>, Washington correspondent for the Baltimore "Republican" (a Democratic paper) who wrote under the initial Z, alleged that one particularly embittered Clayite had wondered how to "get rid of" Harrison, and the paper printed Z's suggestion: "Give him a barrel of hard cider, and settle a pension of two thousand a year on him, and my word for it, he will sit the remainder of his days in his log cabin by the side of a 'sea coal' fire, and study moral philosophy." This gibe was quickly reprinted by other Democratic papers.

The taunt hit home in an America where the log cabin was seen as part of the national heritage; though relatively few lived in one by 1840, many had resided in one earlier in life, or had parents who had. <a href="Alexis%20de%20Tocqueville">Alexis de Tocqueville</a>, the French diplomat who toured America in the 1830s, <a href="Democracy%20in%20America">chronicled them</a> as the pioneer's first dwelling. Hard cider was seen as a drink of the common man. The Whigs decided to take pride in the cabin and cider the Democrats had derided. The origins of how this came to be are uncertain, though the most commonly rendered version of events has, in January 1840, Pennsylvania Whig operative <a href="Thomas%20Elder%20%28lawyer%29">Thomas Elder</a> coming up with the idea of making log cabins a symbol of the Harrison/Tyler campaign. Robert Gray Gunderson, in his account of the 1840 election, described how one was displayed at a Harrisburg ratification meeting on January 20, and "within the month, cabins, [rac]coons, and cider became symbols of resurgent Whiggery". John Gasaway, in his doctoral thesis on the communications in the 1840 campaign, noted that Harrison was called the "log cabin and hard cider candidate" in one paper as early as December 20, 1839, and that images of Harrison and humble abodes he was deemed to have protected date as far back as the War of 1812.

An early casualty of Harrison's 1840 campaign was Democratic Michigan Congressman <a href="Isaac%20Crary">Isaac Crary</a> who on February 14, 1840, as the House of Representatives debated funding for the <a href="Cumberland%20Road">Cumberland Road</a>, essayed an attack on Harrison's record as an Indian fighter, deeming him a bogus hero. Crary sat down to applause from his fellow Democrats. But the next day, Ohio's <a href="Thomas%20Corwin">Thomas Corwin</a>, known as a humorist, rose in the House, and depicted Crary, a militia general in his home state, having to deal with the terrors of the militia's parade day, until afterwards, safe with the survivors, "your general unsheathes his trenchant blade ... and with an energy and remorseless fury he slices the watermelons that lie in heaps around him". As word reached newspapers in February and March, there was much amusement across the nation; Crary failed of renomination to Congress.

By the time of the Ohio Whig Convention in Columbus on February 22, the theme and enthusiasm had taken full hold. Tens of thousands of delegates and spectators filled the streets as a mile-long parade featured log cabins on wheels, with the builders drinking hard cider on the roof, and giant wooden canoes with the image of Old Tippecanoe, though General Harrison was not in attendance. Many of those who came to Columbus dressed as pioneers, in <a href="buckskins">buckskins</a> with <a href="coonskin%20cap">coonskin cap</a>. Barrels of hard cider were provided on every corner. Serious business was accomplished; the national ticket was endorsed and Congressman Corwin nominated for governor. Thirty thousand people attended; "no political rally like this had ever taken place in America."

The 1820s and 1830s had seen a large increase in the franchise in the United States, which by 1840 was granted to many white males, even poor men, and the Whigs sought to recruit among new voters. There was concern that the Harrison campaign would not be able to keep up momentum, but supporters proved inventive. Some Clevelanders who had journeyed to Columbus had made a gigantic paper ball, in diameter, with pro-Harrison and anti-Van Buren slogans written on it. As a newly-coined phrase went, they kept the ball rolling, taking it from town to town. This inspired a Harrison supporter from <a href="Zanesville%2C%20Ohio">Zanesville, Ohio</a>, Alexander Coffman Ross to write new lyrics to an old minstrel song called "Little Pigs", that immediately became a huge hit. In so doing, Ross coined what Shafer called "the first—and the most famous—slogan of any presidential campaign", for the song began,

<poem>
"What has caused this great commotion, motion, motion"
"Our country through?"
"It is the ball a-rolling on,"
"For <a href="Tippecanoe%20and%20Tyler%20too">Tippecanoe and Tyler too</a>,"
"Tippecanoe and Tyler too ..."
</poem>

The campaign was generally administered by a group of Whig congressmen in Washington, including Clay, who pooled their mailing lists; there were organizations in each county tasked with running the local campaign and getting out the vote. Much work was also done by the new political bosses, like Thurlow Weed of New York, who also took charge of much of the fundraising. Greeley, by then editor of the widely circulated Harrison campaign journal, "The Log Cabin", worried that the constant demands for money would drive the wealthy from politics; this did not occur. Much of the money came from those, such as land speculators, who would benefit by the internal improvements to transportation that were backed by the Whigs. Funding for local operations was expected to be raised locally, sometimes through arrangements like <a href="kickback%20%28bribery%29">kickback</a>s from Pennsylvania canal contractors, something implemented by Thaddeus Stevens. <a href="Erie%20Canal">Erie Canal</a> workers were expected to pay a toll to Weed to finance Whig operations. Feeling that every hand was needed to defeat Van Buren, Whig leaders allowed women to help: although they could not vote, they could influence men. This was the first time that an American political party included women in campaign activities on a widespread scale.
In April, the Whigs used the House of Representatives for an attack on President Van Buren. <a href="Charles%20Ogle%20%28politician%29">Charles Ogle</a> of Pennsylvania, a law student and political disciple of Thaddeus Stevens, utilized a debate on White House renovations to spend three days accusing Van Buren of living in luxury at considerable public expense: "If he is vain enough to spend his money in the purchase of rubies for his neck, diamond rings for his fingers, Brussels lace for his breast, filet gloves for his hands, and fabrique de broderies de bougram à Nancy handkerchiefs for his pocket—if he chooses to lay out hundreds of dollars in supplying his toilet with 'Double Extract of Queen Victoria', Eau de Cologne, Corinthian Oil of Cream ... if, I say, Mr. Van Buren sees fit to spend his cash in buying these and other perfumes and cosmetics for his toilet, it can constitute no valid reason for charging the farmers, laborers and mechanics of this country with bills for HEMMING HIS DISH RAGS, FOR HIS LARDING NEEDLES, LIQUOR STANDS, AND FOREIGN CUT WINE COOLERS". Democrats called Ogle's address the "Omnibus of Lies"; Whigs called it the "<a href="Gold%20Spoon%20Oration">Gold Spoons speech</a>" and reprinted it in large numbers, attempting to paint Van Buren, who was in fact of far more humble birth than Harrison, as an aristocratic dandy being challenged by a man of the people.

The <a href="1840%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1840 Democratic National Convention</a> opened at Baltimore's Music Hall on May 4, 1840. A subdued affair, it was greatly overshadowed by a huge "Whig Young Men" gathering that took place in Baltimore at the same time, featuring speeches by Senators Clay and Webster. President Van Buren was nominated for a second term, but the convention made no endorsement for vice president. The incumbent, <a href="Richard%20Mentor%20Johnson">Richard Mentor Johnson</a> of Kentucky was controversial because he had lived with an African American woman and had tried to introduce his children by her into society, and the influential former president, Andrew Jackson, insisted that Johnson be dumped from the ticket. Johnson, who had fought under Harrison during the War of 1812, was popular in the western states as an Indian fighter (he was alleged to be the one who killed Tecumseh), and Van Buren stalled. The lack of an endorsement left the matter up to state parties, and Johnson's rivals soon withdrew, leaving him as the "de facto" vice presidential candidate.

The huge crowds that Harrison's campaign events attracted were unprecedented, though Jackson's campaigns for the presidency had seen rallies on a smaller scale. These gatherings both promoted the Whig ticket and were themselves entertainment for the participants, thus attracting even more attendees; as New York Governor <a href="William%20H.%20Seward">William H. Seward</a>, a Whig, put it, "nothing attracts a crowd so rapidly as the knowledge that there is a crowd already." The Democrats were shocked by the outpouring of support, with Pennsylvania Senator <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a> noting that the people had "abandoned their ordinary business for the purpose of electioneering". As the log cabin theme took hold, alternative nicknames for Harrison such as "Old Buckeye" were dropped, and Whigs, heretofore more associated with the wealthier classes, sought to appeal to the humbly-born. Senator Webster, in his speeches, regretted that he was not born in a log cabin (though his older siblings were), but he told of annual pilgrimages to the old cabin with his children to instill its values in them.

Former <a href="United%20States%20Postmaster%20General">Postmaster General</a> <a href="Amos%20Kendall">Amos Kendall</a>, who managed Van Buren's re-election campaign, instructed that Democrats should not try to defend the administration, but should focus on attacking the opposing party's presidential candidate. By the end of May 1840, Harrison had made no public appearances that year. Even though there was a custom that presidential contenders did not campaign, he was still mocked by the Democratic press. One article alleged he had been shut up in an iron cage with a mug of hard cider, and that he was seeking help from the abolitionists to get released. As was usual for candidates of that era, he made his views known by answering letters from citizens, knowing that some would be reprinted in newspapers. However, Harrison felt that he needed to speak out, and accepted an invitation to make an address at the June 13 commemoration of the 1813 <a href="Siege%20of%20Fort%20Meigs">Siege of Fort Meigs</a>, where he and his troops had held out against British and Native American forces. En route to <a href="Perrysburg%2C%20Ohio">Perrysburg</a>, when leaving his hotel in Columbus, he made what Shafer called "the first presidential campaign speech in history", speaking to a small crowd of supporters, and defending his record against what he deemed personal attacks. In his Fort Meigs speech, Harrison told the crowd, "See that the Government does not acquire too much power. Keep check upon your rulers. Do this, and liberty is safe." Harrison had planned additional speeches, but his swing was cut short when news arrived of the death of his son Benjamin from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. He returned home to take care of his wife, and did not make another speech until July 28.

Lines had been hardening on the matter of slavery, and Democrats accused Harrison of being an abolitionist because of his membership, a half century earlier, in the Richmond Humane Society, an anti-slavery group; he had posted a mixed record on the issue while in Congress. On August 20, he gave a speech on the slave question at <a href="Etna%2C%20Licking%20County%2C%20Ohio">Carthage, Ohio</a>, and stated that what occurred regarding slavery in a state was that state's business alone. He ignored the question of slavery in the District of Columbia and in the territories, both under the jurisdiction of the federal government. The general had pledged that his door would always be open to his old soldiers, but others came as well, and he hosted an unending series of guests. This was especially difficult for him on Sundays, when his wife forbade political discussion. The economy continued to be poor in 1840, a fact that the Whigs never ceased to press, arguing that Van Buren had done little, and that Harrison's inauguration was needed to put a stop to the hard times.

Harrison's health was a minor campaign issue; it was presented by the Whigs as robust, and by Democrats as decrepit. The campaign released a letter from his doctor, testifying to his good health; this was a presidential election first. Another testament to Harrison's health was his speeches: he gave 24 addresses between June and October, all in Ohio and lasting up to three hours; Van Buren did not give any. Harrison did not have the campaign trail to himself; Vice President Johnson told Van Buren that the President should "go out among the voters as I intended doing". Democrats tried to paint Johnson as the true hero of the Battle of the Thames, but the Vice President refused to criticize Harrison's conduct in battle. Nevertheless, Johnson spoke with such enthusiasm that he may have set off a riot in Cleveland, and was followed onto the trail late in the campaign by John Tyler, who had difficulty staying on message and resorted to telling questioners, "I am in favor of what General Harrison and Mr. Clay are in favor of."
Clay and Webster were at the head of perhaps 5,000 Whig speakers who criss-crossed the nation in Harrison's cause. Clay was unenthusiastic about the idea of being a stump speaker, but warmed to it as he sought to boost himself to be Whig presidential candidate in 1844 (Harrison had promised to serve only one term), and spoke widely, especially in the South, though he mentioned Harrison infrequently. Another prominent speaker was a Whig state assemblyman from Illinois and candidate for presidential elector from that state, <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, who spoke to a crowd of 15,000 in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Illinois">Springfield, Illinois</a>, wearing jeans. The aristocratic South Carolina former congressman, <a href="Hugh%20Legare">Hugh Legare</a> also spoke widely, and took to wearing a coonskin cap on the campaign trail, drinking hard cider as he partied with the "Log Cabin Boys". John Bear, the "Buckeye Blacksmith", from <a href="South%20Bloomfield%2C%20Ohio">South Bloomfield, Ohio</a> was a prominent Whig speaker. After making a hit in his first speech outside his home town at the February Columbus rally, the Whigs sent him on the road as a person who could appeal to the tradesmen and farmers who made up much of the electorate. He also got to associate with the elite, meeting Harrison at North Bend and attending a party at the Washington home of former president John Quincy Adams. Bear made 331 speeches, the most of any Whig surrogate, and inspired other craftsmen like <a href="Henry%20Wilson">Henry Wilson</a> of Massachusetts, the "<a href="Natick">Natick</a> Cobbler", who would rise to the vice presidency under <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Grant</a>.

The Democrats had seen the Whigs build log cabins, drink huge amounts of hard cider, hold outsized conventions and publish subsidized newspapers; they asked where the money was coming from to provide such expensive operations. There were no campaign finance disclosure laws in 1840, and the Democrats noted that prominent Whig speakers were paid, "from Daniel Webster down to the traveling Bear". Webster had gone to Britain in 1839, and he was accused by one Democratic newspaper of colluding with the British to spend $5,000,000 given to him to subvert American liberties. Columbus editor <a href="Samuel%20Medary">Sam Medary</a> wrote to Van Buren that "were it not for the secret influence of "money", there would be no contest at all".

The Whigs did well in the state elections held in September, capturing the governorship in traditionally Democratic Maine. On October 14, Jackson weighed in on the race, with a public letter published, "it is my serious belief that if General Harrison should be elected President it will tend to the destruction of our glorious Union and Republican system." Jackson made speeches through his home state of Tennessee on behalf of Van Buren. The Baltimore "Republican", originator of the "log cabin" gibe, alleged that Maryland's slaves believed a Harrison victory would see their immediate emancipation.

There was no nationwide election day in 1840, and many states, by the time they held the presidential vote, had already conducted balloting in local races and for the House of Representatives. One state, South Carolina, did not have a popular vote for president, with electors chosen by the legislature. These state and federal elections, from March to October 1840, led to Whig victories in all but a few states, mainly Democratic strongholds like New Hampshire. Among the victories was that of Whig Governor-elect Corwin in Ohio. The first presidential balloting began on October 29, in Pennsylvania and Ohio, and the polls ended with Rhode Island on November 23. Monday, November 2 was the largest polling day, as 12 states, including New York, voted. As those states compiled the vote, citizens scanned partisan and unreliable newspapers, trying to discern a trend. Even though Harrison led in 10 of the first 11 states to report, former president Jackson wrote to Van Buren, "do not believe a word of it. Nor will I believe that you are not elected until I see all the official returns." But when the Whigs took New York by 13,000 votes, it was clear that Harrison and Tyler had won the election.

Harrison won 19 of the 26 states, including New York (home to Van Buren), Kentucky (to Johnson) and Tennessee (Jackson). Van Buren did win in Virginia, the state of birth of both Whig candidates, and in Illinois, with Lincoln defeated for elector. The electoral vote count was 234 for Harrison and 60 for Van Buren, with the popular vote closer at 1,275,390 for Harrison to 1,128,854 for Van Buren. Of the 60 Van Buren electors, 12 did not vote for Johnson, with 11 (all from South Carolina) choosing <a href="Littleton%20W.%20Tazewell">Littleton W. Tazewell</a> for vice president, and one (from Virginia) favoring Governor <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">James K. Polk</a> of Tennessee. Turnout was 81 percent of eligible voters, setting a record since surpassed only in 1860 and 1876. The Whigs took both houses of Congress, and a majority of state governorships.

Of the Northern states, Harrison lost only Illinois and New Hampshire; he won his home state of Ohio, and also his home county (Hamilton). Voters in the Kentucky district Johnson once represented in the House of Representatives had backed Van Buren by 1,600 votes in 1836, but favored Harrison by 251 votes in 1840. Both major parties saw an increase in vote, in part because 51 percent more people voted in 1840 than in 1836. The Democrats alleged that Harrison had won the popular vote with bribed and ineligible voters; the Whigs responded by accusing their rivals of being unwilling to accept the will of the people.

Even before the returns were in, office seekers descended on North Bend, forcing Harrison to put up with their importunities even at his dinner table. Noted New York Congressman <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a>, a future Whig president: "I understand they have come down upon General Harrison like a pack of famished wolves, and he has been literally driven from his and forced to take refuge in Kentucky". Harrison found Kentucky no haven; he apparently hoped to avoid meeting with Clay, but, as writer <a href="Gail%20Collins">Gail Collins</a> put it in her biography of Harrison, the senator "ran him to ground, lassoed him, and took him off to <a href="Ashland%20%28Henry%20Clay%20estate%29">Ashland</a>, his estate". Clay had no desire to be in the Harrison administration himself, but expected to run the government from the Senate, and the visit went pleasantly. The two parted on excellent terms, with Clay under the impression several of his designees would be placed in the new cabinet.

The inauguration of the first Whig president would give that party the opportunity to fill federal jobs for the first time. This proved complicated, and Harrison was called to Washington in mid-January, nearly two months before his March 4, 1841 inaugural date, to be at hand. He made a very public progress from Ohio to Washington, getting little rest along the way: even those Whigs who were not seeking government employment wanted to see and meet the <a href="President-elect%20of%20the%20United%20States">President-elect</a> and celebrations often surrounded his hotel all night. He reached Washington on February 9, his 68th birthday. After consultation with Whig politicians, he filled his cabinet, to the disappointment of some, like Henry Clay, who saw his nominees passed over, and Thaddeus Stevens, who believed he had been promised the position of Postmaster General.
Harrison allowed Secretary of State-designate Daniel Webster to edit his inauguration speech, but he nevertheless spoke for an hour and 45 minutes, setting a record for verbosity that still stands. As the public was not excluded from the White House, there was no relief from the swarms of office seekers even after March 4, and relations with Clay broke down to such an extent that President Harrison banned him from the White House. Clay left town, never to see the President again. Harrison, despite the office seekers, liked to walk to the market each morning but on March 24 got caught in the rain and soon fell ill. The primitive treatment he received, possibly influenced by his own medical training a half-century old, did nothing to improve his condition, and he died in the early morning hours of April 4. Vice President Tyler had returned to his home in Virginia once the Senate adjourned, and Secretary of State Webster sent his son <a href="Fletcher%20Webster">Fletcher</a> to inform Tyler of Harrison's death.

Tyler was not only the first vice president to succeed to the presidency, but at age 51, was the youngest president to that point. One of the main political principles he was guided by was states' rights, and he opposed a national bank, that the Whigs wanted to help develop the country, but which Tyler saw as an imposition on the sovereignty of the states. Tyler vetoed two bills to establish a national bank. Whig leaders, who wanted such a bank, saw political advantage in a breach with him. In September 1841, most of Tyler's cabinet resigned and Whig congressional leaders expelled him from the party.

Harrison's 1840 campaign was one of firsts. It featured the first presidential candidate to speak for himself, the first to have a <a href="grassroots">grassroots</a> campaign involving the mass of the people (including many women, who could not then vote), and according to Shafer, "the beginning of presidential campaigning as entertainment". Gunderson noted, "for the first time, a presidential candidate abandoned a customary Olympic seclusion for the fervid clamor <a href="Citizenship%20in%20a%20Republic">of the arena</a>". In her biography of Harrison, Collins deemed the candidate's speechmaking as symbolic of "the erasing of the barrier between common Americans and their Chief Executive". Having been born in a log cabin, or in some other humble dwelling, remained a staple of presidential campaign biographies well into the 20th century.

Collins saw the 1840 campaign as "perhaps the last in which the parties focused on converting the newcomers rather than turning out the base and trying to tack on added support from the uncertain middle". Holt concurred that 1840 marked such a transition, "After 1840 political leaders could predict how most men would vote. The question was whether they voted at all." To ensure that they did, politicians began to stress the conflict between the parties, trying to ensure that voters would come to the polls even if they did not greatly care about the issues or candidates, so that they could inflict a defeat on the other party. The coalition that elected Harrison remained the foundation of the Whig Party until it dissolved amid sectional tensions over slavery in the 1850s.

Shafer saw Harrison's <a href="log%20cabin%20campaign">log cabin campaign</a> as "the first image advertising campaign for a presidential candidate, establishing forever a basic tactic of political campaigns. It is called lying ... The rollicking run of Tippecanoe and Tyler Too changed presidential campaigns forever". K. R. Constantine Gutzman, who penned the "American National Biography" piece on Harrison, concurred: "The Whig campaign of 1840, in which Benjamin Harrison's son was portrayed as the occupant of a log cabin and a man of the people, is remembered derisively by historians (as it was derided by Democrats at the time) as the 'Log Cabin and Hard Cider' campaign. 'Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too' (the slogan that converted a controversial battle into a rousing victory in American popular memory) is supposed to have swayed a drunken electorate. In fact, as Henry Clay lamented, it was a Whig election cycle, and virtually anyone nominated as a Whig would probably have defeated Van Buren."

Gasaway disagreed that the Whigs deceived the voters, "The 'fable' of 1840 tells us that the Whigs triumphed over baffled and listless Democrats by convincing voters that Harrison lived in a log cabin and that he was a great war hero when, so the legend goes, neither claim was true. [But] Whigs did "not" say that Harrison lived in a log cabin and in fact went into great detail describing his actual house. The 'log cabin' was much more symbol than claim." Gasaway suggested that the 1840 campaign gained a poor reputation because Harrison and the Whig Party soon vanished from the scene, and many of those who had supported both in 1840 saw the election as a squandered opportunity: "Add to this the fact that the poor man died only thirty days into an administration launched by what was perhaps the most exciting election campaign in the nation's history up to that time and we are confronted ... with an undeniable and almost irresistible touch of "<a href="opera%20bouffe">opera bouffé</a>"."

Shafer saw the lasting legacy of Harrison's campaign:

Mary Margaret O'Reilly

Mary Margaret O'Reilly (October 14, 1865 – December 6, 1949) was an American <a href="civil%20service">civil servant</a> who served as the Assistant Director of the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> from 1924 until 1938. One of the United States government's highest-ranking female employees of her time, she worked at the Mint for 34 years, during which she often served as acting director during the <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Mint Director</a>'s absence.

O'Reilly was born in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Springfield, Massachusetts</a> to an <a href="Irish%20American">Irish immigrant family</a>. Growing up in that state, she left school around the age of 14 to help support both her widowed mother and her siblings. Likely starting work in the local <a href="textile%20mill">textile mill</a>s, she gained <a href="Clerk">clerical training</a> at <a href="night%20school">night school</a> before working as a clerk in <a href="Worcester%2C%20Massachusetts">Worcester</a> for eighteen years. In 1904, O'Reilly gained a position at the Mint Bureau, resulting in a move to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> She rose rapidly in the bureau's hierarchy – an unusual feat for a woman at that time – and was frequently called upon to testify before the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a>. As many of the Mint's directors were political appointees who had little knowledge or interest in the bureau's operations, the task of running the institution often fell to her. In 1924 she was officially appointed Assistant Director.

In 1933, the Mint gained its first female Director, <a href="Nellie%20Tayloe%20Ross">Nellie Tayloe Ross</a>, and despite initial mistrust between her and O'Reilly, they came to forge a strong bond. Although scheduled for mandatory retirement in 1935, O'Reilly was considered to be so indispensable to the bureau's operations that <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. President</a> <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> postponed this until 1938. During her later years, O'Reilly remained in Washington D.C.; she no longer involved herself in Mint affairs, instead devoting much of her attention to <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> charitable work.

Mary Margaret O'Reilly was born in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Springfield, Massachusetts</a>, on October 14, 1865. Her parents, James A. and Joanna O'Reilly, were immigrants from Ireland, and Mary was one of five children. The family lived in Springfield and nearby <a href="Chicopee%2C%20Massachusetts">Chicopee, Massachusetts</a>, where James O'Reilly was a liquor wholesaler. He died after an illness in 1873. As well as depriving the family of income, his death caused his family legal trouble: Austin O'Reilly, a clerk in the now-closed O'Reilly business, tried to settle the estate by selling the remaining alcohol, but lacked a license to do so. Joanna O'Reilly denied any knowledge of business affairs. Austin's conviction for transporting liquor without a license was upheld by the <a href="Massachusetts%20Supreme%20Judicial%20Court">Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court</a>.

Mary left school after <a href="student%23first%20year">ninth grade</a>, at or soon after age 14, as her help was needed to support the family. She likely worked for one of the local <a href="textile%20mill">textile mill</a>s, and attended night school to train as a clerk and stenographer. From 1885 to 1903, she worked as a clerk, living in <a href="Worcester%2C%20Massachusetts">Worcester</a> along with a brother, in a <a href="boarding%20house">boarding house</a> owned by their mother.

O'Reilly was hired by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> as a Class D temporary clerk in 1904, when she was 38 years old, older than most new employees. She served in the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the Bureau of the Mint, where <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Mint Director</a> <a href="George%20E.%20Roberts">George E. Roberts</a> was impressed by her business experience and competence. Initially having only temporary status, she was made a permanent employee in 1905, and was promoted again that year to Clerk Class I at a salary of $1,200. When <a href="Margaret%20Kelly%20%28civil%20servant%29">Margaret Kelly</a> was commissioned Examiner of the Bureau of the Mint in 1911, the ripple of promotions in her wake included O'Reilly, who became adjuster of accounts. This made her in effect the chief clerk of the Mint Bureau, with responsibility for reviewing all contracts. According to Teva J. Scheer, biographer of <a href="Nellie%20Tayloe%20Ross">Nellie Tayloe Ross</a> (O'Reilly's final Mint Director before retirement) "it must have required an almost unprecedented combination of drive and intelligence for [O'Reilly] to have climbed so far up through the organization in her male-dominated work environment".
During the 1910s, O'Reilly continued to gain promotion, serving both as examiner and as computer of bullion. She was frequently called upon to testify before <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a>. In 1915, <a href="Robert%20W.%20Woolley">Robert W. Woolley</a> was appointed Mint Director, and was likely O'Reilly's favorite of those who served in that position during her third of a century at the Mint. She often concluded memoranda with personal good wishes, and Woolley reciprocated. After Woolley resigned in August 1916, O'Reilly served as acting director for part of the time until Woolley's successor <a href="Friedrich%20Johannes%20Hugo%20von%20Engelken">Friedrich Johannes Hugo von Engelken</a> took office the next month, though Adjuster of the Bureau of the Mint Fred H. Chafflin held the acting position for much of the interregnum.

Most directors of the Mint of the early 20th century were political appointees, lacking previous experience with the bureau. Von Engelken during his six-month term as director in 1916 and 1917 left almost all supervision of the mints and assay offices to O'Reilly. The Mint eliminated production of <a href="proof%20coin">proof coin</a>s, popular among collectors, in 1916. Although the suggestion that the bureau eliminate the special coins, on which it lost money, came from <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> Superintendent Adam M. Joyce, and was approved by von Engelken, O'Reilly signed many of the letters to numismatists, and thus was blamed for the change in policy.

When von Engelken resigned in February 1917, his successor was <a href="Raymond%20T.%20Baker">Raymond T. Baker</a>, who foresaw that women would hold high government positions in increasing numbers, and gave O'Reilly a more public role. Each year, Baker appeared before Congress to defend the bureau's appropriation requests, and O'Reilly sat behind him. In 1920 and 1921, Baker tried to get Congress to formally designate O'Reilly, who then held the title of executive clerk, as Assistant Director, but without success. After the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Warren%20G.%20Harding">Harding administration</a> took office, Baker was replaced in 1922 by <a href="Frank%20E.%20Scobey">Frank E. Scobey</a>, one of <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Harding</a>'s <a href="Ohio%20Gang">Ohio Gang</a>. The new director had little interest in Mint affairs, and O'Reilly not only supervised the bureau's operations, but was the chief witness before Congress in 1922, defending both the appropriation request and the continuing drive to have herself designated Assistant Director. This time, Congress was more amenable, and she gained the title effective from 1924.

In December 1921, a public relations crisis over the design of the new <a href="Peace%20dollar">Peace dollar</a> had erupted while Baker was on a three-day trip by train to the West Coast. <a href="Anthony%20de%20Francisci">Anthony de Francisci</a>, designer of the coin, had included a broken sword on the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">reverse</a>, which he intended as a sign of the end of war, but which many interpreted as a symbol of disgrace. Anger at such a design resonated in a country deeply sensitive about such matters due to <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. With Baker unreachable, O'Reilly realized the sword would have to be removed, and approached Treasury Undersecretary <a href="Seymour%20Parker%20Gilbert">Seymour Parker Gilbert</a>, who as acting secretary approved a revised design. The Mint's Chief Engraver, <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">George T. Morgan</a>, skillfully removed the sword from the already-prepared coinage <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23H">hubs</a> even before Baker cabled his own approval of the revised design he had not seen.

O'Reilly ran most Mint operations under Scobey and his successor, <a href="Robert%20J.%20Grant">Robert J. Grant</a>. Although the Mint Bureau was very busy in the booming economy of the 1920s, numismatic historian Roger Burdette points out that there were flaws in operations—for example, Philadelphia Mint officials, instead of setting aside gold coins from each batch delivered for inspecting and testing by the <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">annual Assay Commission</a>, took all assay coins from a bag set aside at the start of the year, increasing the likelihood that nonstandard coins would go undetected. O'Reilly did keep a close eye on coinage operations, warning the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a> in November 1931 that it had produced fewer than 200,000 <a href="nickel%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">nickels</a>, a figure that if allowed to stand would have resulted in the issue being hoarded by collectors. She directed the mint to strike nothing but nickels for the remainder of the year, resulting in a total mintage for the 1931–S of 1,200,000, still the second-lowest by date and mint mark in the <a href="Buffalo%20nickel">Buffalo nickel</a> series.

When the Democratic <a href="Presidency%20of%20Franklin%20Delano%20Roosevelt">Roosevelt administration</a> took office in 1933, O'Reilly was serving as acting director following Grant's resignation. President <a href="Franklin%20Delano%20Roosevelt">Franklin Roosevelt</a> (FDR) appointed former Wyoming governor <a href="Nellie%20Tayloe%20Ross">Nellie Tayloe Ross</a> as Mint Director, the first woman to hold that position. By then, O'Reilly was 67 years old, and appeared as a small, grandmotherly figure who was dubbed "the Sweetheart of the Treasury"—an appearance that hid her mental strength and determination. Ross's personal secretary, Edness Wilkins, described the Assistant Director of the Mint as "ruthless".
Ross and O'Reilly had mutual suspicions to overcome. Ross, who had recently endured poor relations with <a href="Eleanor%20Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a> and others on FDR's campaign, did not trust the career staff. O'Reilly saw another political appointee with no experience at the Mint Bureau replacing Grant, who had been <a href="Denver%20Mint">Denver Mint</a> superintendent before his directorship. After a brief period, the two women came to appreciate each other's merits.

Among the issues that the Mint Bureau had to face in 1933 and 1934 was the calling-in of most gold coins. When the Treasury Department issued regulations allowing such coins to be surrendered at branches of the <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20Bank">Federal Reserve Bank</a>, O'Reilly sent out a memorandum over her signature as acting director noting that the Fed had no facilities to accept any gold other than <a href="gold%20bar">bars</a> with a government stamp. At the time, the Mint Bureau was one of the lowest-status branches of the Department of the Treasury, esteemed far less than the <a href="United%20States%20Secret%20Service">Secret Service</a> and other law enforcement-related agencies that fell under the Treasury Secretary. Burdette points out that the gold regulations showed a lack of basic Mint knowledge both by Roosevelt's appointees and the holdover senior officials from the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Herbert%20Hoover">Hoover administration</a>.
Ross and O'Reilly soon came to the usual division of labor between the director and assistant: the director would handle public affairs and make policy decisions as needed, while the assistant dealt with the day-to-day business of the bureau. Ross undertook a heavy travel schedule, visiting Mint facilities, making speeches backing Roosevelt, and campaigning for Democratic candidates in Wyoming. This left O'Reilly running the Washington office as acting director. The two women carried on a businesslike but warm correspondence during these times, with O'Reilly writing to Ross (who had embarked on a tour of the mints) "I am so anxious to have your mind at ease about the office here [in Washington] that I have resorted to rather frequent telegrams. They are so much more direct and up to date than letters ... my love to you and every good wish for the success of your visits to our beloved mint institutions." Scheer suggests that O'Reilly would have found Ross's reports from the field valuable; they showed how the Mint recovered from the initial years of the Depression, when relatively few coins were produced, to the mid-1930s, when strong demand for coinage led the bureau to run the mints with two or even three shifts.

In 1935, O'Reilly reached the <a href="mandatory%20retirement">mandatory federal retirement</a> age of 70. Her knowledge of bureau affairs was so extensive, and was so badly needed, that she was exempted from mandatory retirement by special order of President Roosevelt, at the request of Ross, giving O'Reilly an extra year in the Mint Service. Although Ross supported the extension, she could not be seen as unable to do her job without O'Reilly's assistance, and hired Frank Leland Howard of the <a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a>, who had a background in accounting, as O'Reilly's prospective replacement. Roosevelt approved a similar extension in 1936, a distinction considered so significant that Treasury Secretary <a href="Henry%20Morgenthau%2C%20Jr.">Henry Morgenthau, Jr.</a> hosted a luncheon in her honor. Roosevelt again extended her federal service by one year in late 1937, though warning that he would not exempt her again. An attempt by Morgenthau to further extend her tenure was turned down by the president the next July, and she retired on October 29, 1938, to be replaced by Howard.

At O'Reilly's request, there was no ceremony to mark her retirement, though her fellow employees chipped in to buy her a diamond-encrusted watch, which they persuaded her to accept. President Roosevelt and Secretary Morgenthau sent letters of appreciation for her service. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" carried word of her retirement, but no interview, and a week later editorialized that "there is modernity here, too. An answer to America's challenge to women. It points to what women want out of life, and what women can get and give."

After her retirement, O'Reilly continued to live in her rooms at the <a href="Hay%E2%80%93Adams%20Hotel">Hay–Adams residence</a> in Washington. She did not involve herself in Mint affairs; though Morgenthau sent her a few letters, they did not mention business. O'Reilly kept busy by organizing fundraising for Catholic charities. She was not interviewed when the Mint in 1944 investigated how several <a href="1933%20double%20eagle">1933 double eagle</a>s, never officially released, had come onto the market, an omission Burdette finds unusual.

O'Reilly died on December 6, 1949 in Washington. Her "New York Times" obituary recalled that when she had been granted the first extension by Roosevelt, reporters had sought to interview her, only to be met with the following statement:

Black American Sign Language

Black American Sign Language (BASL) or Black Sign Variation (BSV) is a <a href="dialect">dialect</a> of <a href="American%20Sign%20Language">American Sign Language</a> (ASL) used most commonly by deaf <a href="African%20American">African American</a>s in the United States. The divergence from ASL was influenced largely by the <a href="School%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States">segregation</a> of schools in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">American South</a>. Like other schools at the time, schools for the deaf were segregated based upon race, creating two language communities among deaf signers: White deaf signers at White schools and Black deaf signers at Black schools. Today, BASL is still used by signers in the South despite public schools having been legally <a href="School%20integration%20in%20the%20United%20States">desegregated</a> since 1954.

Linguistically, BASL differs from other varieties of ASL in its <a href="American%20Sign%20Language%20phonology">phonology</a>, <a href="syntax">syntax</a>, and <a href="vocabulary">vocabulary</a>. BASL tends to have a larger signing space, meaning that some signs are produced further away from the body than in other dialects. Signers of BASL also tend to prefer two-handed variants of signs, while signers of ASL tend to prefer one-handed variants. Some signs are different in BASL as well, with some borrowings from <a href="African%20American%20English">African American English</a>.

Like many educational institutions for hearing children during the 1800s and early 1900s, schools for deaf children were <a href="School%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States">segregated</a> based on race. The first school for the deaf in the United States, the <a href="American%20School%20for%20the%20Deaf">American School for the Deaf</a> (ASD), was founded in 1817 but did not admit any Black students until 1952. Of the schools for the deaf that were founded, few admitted <a href="Person%20of%20color">students of color</a>. Seeing a lack of educational opportunities for Black deaf children, <a href="Platt%20Skinner">Platt Skinner</a> founded the Skinner School for the Colored Deaf, Dumb, and Blind in 1856 in <a href="Niagara%20Falls%2C%20New%20York">Niagara Falls, New York</a>. Skinner described his school as "the first effort of its kind in the country ... We receive and instruct those and only those who are refused admission to all other institutions and are despised on account of their color." The school moved to <a href="Trenton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Trenton, New Jersey</a>, in 1860. After it closed in 1866, no Northern state created an institution for Black deaf children. Even after these states outlawed segregation by 1900, integration was sparse, as some institutions allowed Black students and others did not.

After the foundation and success of the American School for the Deaf, many other institutions for the deaf were founded throughout the country. Since schools, particularly in the South, were segregated, many Southern states created separate schools or departments for Black deaf children. The first school established for Black deaf children below the <a href="Mason%E2%80%93Dixon%20line">Mason–Dixon line</a> opened in the <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">District of Columbia</a> in 1857; it remained segregated until 1958. The last Southern state to create an institution for Black deaf children was <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> in 1938. Black deaf children became a language community isolated from White deaf children, with different means of <a href="language%20socialization">language socialization</a>, allowing for different dialects to develop. Because the education of White children was privileged over that of Black children, <a href="oralism">oralism</a>—the prominent <a href="pedagogy">pedagogical</a> method of the time—was not as strictly applied to the Black deaf students. Oralist methods often forbade the use of sign language, so Black deaf students had more opportunities to use ASL than did their White peers. Despite the decision in "<a href="Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a>" (1954), which declared racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional, integration was slow to come. Schools for the deaf were no exception: the last desegregated in 1978, 24 years after the decision.

As schools began to integrate, students and teachers noticed differences in the way Black students and White students signed. <a href="Carolyn%20McCaskill">Carolyn McCaskill</a>, now professor of ASL and Deaf Studies at <a href="Gallaudet%20University">Gallaudet University</a>, recalls the challenge of understanding the dialect of ASL used by her White principal and teachers after her segregated school of her youth integrated: "When I began attending the school, I did not understand the teacher and she did not understand me because we used different signs." <a href="Carl%20G.%20Croneberg">Carl G. Croneberg</a> was the first to discuss differences between BASL and White ASL in his appendices of the 1965 version of the "Dictionary of American Sign Language." Work has continued on BASL since then.

As deaf education and sign language research continued to evolve, so did the perception of ASL. With the publication of the "Dictionary of American Sign Language", ASL began to be recognized as a legitimate language. The greater acceptance of ASL as a language led to standardization and the development of a <a href="Prestige%20%28sociolinguistics%29">prestige dialect</a>, which was based upon the signs used at Gallaudet University. Despite this standardization, ASL has regional, distinct accents similar to those of spoken languages. Dialects that are different from the standard one, and especially those spoken by marginalized groups, are often stigmatized. As a non-standard dialect, BASL is stigmatized by signers and considered to be inferior to prestige dialects of ASL. This difference in prestige has led BASL speakers to <a href="code%20switching">code switch</a> to a prestige dialect when speaking with different groups of people, despite BASL being <a href="mutually%20intelligible">mutually intelligible</a> with other dialects of ASL.

A study of Southern Black signers found that when compared to older signers who attended segregated schools, younger black ASL signers express more positive attitudes toward the dialect. Older signers who attended lower quality schools due to the inequality of "<a href="separate%20but%20equal">separate but equal</a>" clauses believed that white signing is higher quality because it appears to be more complicated. However, this is likely because the lack of ASL-skilled teachers in the black schools at the time; there is no evidence that white signing is more official or complex than Black ASL. Black signs are typically more like the "standard" signs taught in schools and textbooks. Black signing is also associated with rhythm and expression.

When asked, many signers in the South gave anecdotal accounts of differences between the signing of Black and White signers. These differences turned out to be aspects of the differing <a href="American%20Sign%20Language%20phonology">phonology</a> of BASL. Among these accounts were claims that Black signers had a larger signing space and used more two-handed signs. Investigation into these anecdotes has found correlations.

When compared, Black signers were more likely than were White signers to produce signs outside of the typical signing space and to use two-handed signs. <a href="Adverb">Adverb</a>s are most likely to use a larger signing space. Less <a href="Markedness">marked</a> forms, such as <a href="pronoun">pronoun</a>s, <a href="determiner">determiner</a>s, plain <a href="verb">verb</a>s, and <a href="noun">noun</a>s, tend to be less likely to be produced outside the typical signing space. The selection of two-handed signs over one-handed signs was found to have <a href="Optimality%20theory">systematic constraints</a> on their production. When the sign could be produced with one or two hands, Black signers often produced the variant that matched the handedness of the following sign; if the following sign was two-handed, they were more likely to produce a two-handed variant, while if the following sign was one-handed, they were more likely to produce the one-handed variant. The use of innovative one-handed forms, though, even in environments which favored them, did not exceed 50 percent.

BASL signers further tend to favor lowered variants of side-of-forehead signs resulting in contact at the cheek. The sign is usually produced by placing the fingers of a flat hand on the <a href="temple%20%28anatomy%29">temple</a>, but when lowered the fingers make contact at the <a href="cheek">cheek</a>. Early research showed that BASL signers used these lowered forms at a rate of 53 percent, with grammatical category being the strongest constraint. Other conditioning environments for lowered signs depend on preceding location; for instance, signs produced in front of the body lead to lowered sign variants, while signs produced at the head cause signers to favor non-lowered forms.

Unlike ASL, BASL allows for the frequent use of <a href="syntactic%20repetition">syntactic repetition</a>. In a study conducted by McCaskill, of 26 signers (13 Black and 13 White), Black signers had 57 instances of repetition compared to 19 from White signers, and of those 19 instances, 18 were made by a single signer. The use of repetition by BASL signers is considered to be <a href="Pragmatics">pragmatic</a> rather than as a way to clarify meaning.

A study in 2004 by Melanie Metzger and Susan Mather found that Black male signers used <a href="constructed%20action">constructed action</a>, with or without <a href="constructed%20dialogue">constructed dialogue</a>, more often than White signers, but never used constructed dialogue by itself. These results were not reproduced in a later study into constructed action and constructed dialogue by McCaskill, which found that Black signers not only used constructed dialogue, but did so more frequently than white signers.

<a href="Lexical%20variation">Lexical variation</a> between BASL and other dialects of ASL was first noted in the "Dictionary of American Sign Language." In a later study of 34 lexical signs, Black signers were found to have 28 signs that White signers did not know. Older signers are more likely to use variant signs than younger signers. Most of these signs, having been developed in segregated schools for the Black Deaf, refer to everyday life. Younger signers of BASL are less likely to use these variants, but when asked about them are aware that older signers have and use these innovative signs.

A body of work has arisen looking at the similarities between Black American Sign Language and <a href="African%20American%20Vernacular%20English">African-American English</a> (AAVE), since both are language varieties marked by their use in African-American communities. In 1998 John Lewis investigated the incorporation of aspects of AAVE into BASL. He reported that, during narrative storytelling by a Black signer, there were "<a href="African%20American%20Vernacular%20English">Ebonic shifts</a>" marked by shifts in posture and rhythmicity and by incorporating side-to-side head movement. He concluded that this "songified" quality was related to the style of AAE. This finding was not reproduced by McCaskill, which she attributes to the nature of the speech acts: Lewis analyzed a narrative event while McCaskill used natural or elicited data. <a href="Lexical%20borrowing">Lexical borrowing</a> has been seen in BASL signers under age 3, which is likely due to the advances in mass media—younger signers would have more contact with AAE through movies, television, and the Internet.

When asked about distinctive features of their signing, Black Deaf signers tended to identify a number of idioms borrowed from AAVE. Some were <a href="Calque">literal translations</a>, such as or , which are signed the standard way but have meanings different from their literal interpretation. Other loan words modified existing signs, such as , which took the bent-v handshape of and moved it up to the head to indicate a new meaning of "stop imagining things".

Panama–Pacific commemorative coins

The five Panama–Pacific commemorative coins were produced in connection with the 1915 <a href="Panama%E2%80%93Pacific%20International%20Exposition">Panama–Pacific International Exposition</a> in San Francisco. Struck at <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">that city's mint</a>, the issue included round and octagonal $50 pieces. Excepting modern <a href="bullion%20coins">bullion coins</a>, these two gold pieces are the highest denomination ever issued and the largest coins ever struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a>. The octagonal $50 piece is the only U.S. coin to be issued that is not round.

In January 1915, Congress passed legislation for a silver <a href="half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollar</a>, as well as a <a href="gold%20dollar">gold dollar</a>, <a href="quarter%20eagle">quarter eagle</a> ($2.50 piece), and two $50 pieces: one round and one octagonal. The Mint had already consulted artists. <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="William%20G.%20McAdoo">William G. McAdoo</a> initially rejected all their designs. Two of them, <a href="Robert%20Ingersoll%20Aitken">Robert I. Aitken</a> for the $50 pieces and <a href="Charles%20Keck">Charles Keck</a> for the gold dollar, persevered, and their submissions were used. The half dollar and quarter eagle were designed by <a href="Chief%20Engraver%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Chief Engraver</a> <a href="Charles%20E.%20Barber">Charles E. Barber</a>, possibly with the participation of his longtime assistant, <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">George T. Morgan</a>.

The coins were vended at the Exposition by prominent <a href="numismatics">numismatist</a> <a href="Farran%20Zerbe">Farran Zerbe</a>. They did not sell well, and many of each denomination were returned for melting. Only a few hundred of each of the $50 pieces were distributed, making them the lowest-mintage commemorative coins. They catalog for up to $200,000, depending on condition.

Private gold pieces, sometimes dubbed "pioneer gold", were struck several times during the 19th century from locally produced bullion in areas where federal coins were scarce. These unofficial coins came from sites ranging from Georgia to Oregon. Many, ranging in denomination from 25 cents to 50 dollars, are relics of the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a> and its aftermath. The fifty-dollar denomination was struck by private minters such as Kellogg and Co. The private $50 pieces were round in form, but those struck by Augustus Humbert for the U.S. <a href="Assay%20Office">Assay Office</a> at San Francisco, prior to the establishment of the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a> in 1854, were octagonal. Humbert's pieces were not money in a legal sense, as Congress had not authorized them as legal tender, and were officially deemed ingots. Nevertheless, they contained their full value in gold. Bearing the denomination "Fifty Dollars", they were called "slugs" or "quintuple <a href="eagle%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">eagles</a>" by the public. They circulated widely in California and elsewhere in the Far West, and were accepted on par with federal gold coins.

All of these $50 pieces, public or private, are very rare and valuable today: One of Humbert's octagonal pieces, dated 1851 and with a lettered edge, sold at auction in 2010 for $546,250. The only $50 piece produced by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> prior to 1915 was the 1877 <a href="pattern%20coin">pattern</a> <a href="half%20union">half union</a>, produced experimentally at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>, though it was not approved as a circulating coin.

In 1904, San Francisco merchant Rueben Hale proposed an exposition in his home city for 1915, both to commemorate the opening of the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> and to mark the 400th anniversary of <a href="Vasco%20N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez%20de%20Balboa">Vasco Núñez de Balboa</a> becoming the first European known to view the Pacific Ocean from the Americas: in phrasing then current, he discovered the Pacific. Although the <a href="1906%20San%20Francisco%20earthquake">1906 San Francisco earthquake</a> and fire caused a momentary setback to these plans, it actually sparked additional fundraising. Many of the wealthiest in California gave financial support, the state matched private donations dollar for dollar, and in 1911, President <a href="William%20Howard%20Taft">William Howard Taft</a> selected San Francisco over its competitor, New Orleans, to host the fair.
The <a href="Panama%E2%80%93Pacific%20International%20Exposition">Panama–Pacific International Exposition</a>, constructed in San Francisco by the <a href="Golden%20Gate">Golden Gate</a> at a cost of $50 million, was open from February 20, 1915, to December 4, 1915. About 19,000,000 people attended, and the exposition was a great success, generating enough profit to build the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Civic%20Auditorium">San Francisco Civic Auditorium</a> with about $1 million remaining. The <a href="Palace%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Palace of Fine Arts</a> is the only building from the fair which remains on the site.

Commemorative coins were not then sold to the public by the Mint, as they subsequently have been. Instead, a commemorative's authorizing legislation would designate a group or organization to purchase the coins from the Mint at face value, and sell them to the public as a fundraiser. Among those who had pushed for commemorative legislation in the past, and had been involved in the sale of the resulting coins, was <a href="Farran%20Zerbe">Farran Zerbe</a>, a collector and numismatic promoter who had by 1914 served as president of the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a>. Zerbe was a controversial figure—some felt the coins with which he had been involved had been sold at inflated prices—but he helped promote the hobby with his exhibit, "Money of the World", which later became part of the Chase Manhattan Money Museum.

Several proposals for commemorative coins had been introduced by mid-1914, though none had been issued by the Mint since 1905. One, sponsored by New York Senator <a href="Elihu%20Root">Elihu Root</a>, called for a commemorative <a href="quarter%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">quarter dollar</a> marking a century of peace, as well as the August 1914 opening of the Panama Canal. Two bills were introduced calling for coins to commemorate and benefit the Panama–Pacific Exposition; H.R. 16902 was introduced by California Congressman <a href="Julius%20Kahn%20%28congressman%29">Julius Kahn</a> on June 3, 1914. Senate bill (S.) 6309 was introduced in that body by New Jersey Senator <a href="James%20E.%20Martine">James E. Martine</a> on July 6. This bill called for two $50 pieces (one round, one octagonal), a <a href="quarter%20eagle">quarter eagle</a> or $2.50 in gold, a commemorative <a href="gold%20dollar">gold dollar</a>, and a half dollar. The octagonal pieces were intended to recall the unofficial $50 coins struck during the Gold Rush

Martine's bill passed the Senate on August 3, having been approved by the Committee on Industrial Expositions, to which it had been referred. The only objection was procedural, by Utah's <a href="Reed%20Smoot">Reed Smoot</a>: that the bill should have instead been referred to and approved by the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, or its Committee on Finance. Neither Smoot nor any other senator objected to the bill itself, which Martine indicated had the support of <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="William%20G.%20McAdoo">William G. McAdoo</a>. S. 6309 was the following day sent to the House of Representatives, where it was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures. It emerged from that committee on September 1, 1914, with several amendments, one of which increased the combined authorized mintage of the two $50 pieces from 2,000 to 3,000. S. 6309 was briefly considered by the House of Representatives on January 4, 1915, and passed after Kahn successfully proposed a minor amendment to strike out the dollar sign from the phrase "silver coins of the denomination of $50 cents each". The Senate concurred in the House amendments two days later, passing the bill without question, change, or opposition, and President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> signed it into law on January 16.

Once Kahn's bill was introduced in the House, <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Mint Director</a> <a href="George%20E.%20Roberts">George E. Roberts</a> began to make informal arrangements to prepare for the commemorative issue. The bill called for four different designs (the two $50 pieces would differ mainly in shape), plus a commemorative medal to be sold to fairgoers, with an award medal to be given to prizewinning exhibitors. All of these pieces were to be struck by the Bureau of the Mint, and Roberts asked the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a> to recommend artists. Among those recommended were <a href="Adolph%20A.%20Weinman">Adolph A. Weinman</a> (who would design the <a href="Mercury%20dime">Mercury dime</a> and <a href="Walking%20Liberty%20half%20dollar">Walking Liberty half dollar</a> in 1916), and <a href="Bela%20Lyon%20Pratt">Bela L. Pratt</a> (creator of the 1908 <a href="Indian%20Head%20gold%20pieces">Indian Head gold pieces</a>). Others included sculptors <a href="Evelyn%20Longman">Evelyn Longman</a>, <a href="Robert%20Ingersoll%20Aitken">Robert I. Aitken</a>, <a href="Charles%20Keck">Charles Keck</a>, and <a href="Paul%20Manship">Paul Manship</a>.

Roberts wrote to several of the sculptors, and found Aitken interested in creating the $50 pieces. The Mint Director's tentative negotiations with Aitken for the large gold coins and with <a href="Buffalo%20nickel">Buffalo nickel</a> designer <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earl Fraser</a> for the award medal ended when Roberts resigned in November to take a banking job; McAdoo appointed Dr. Frederic Dewey as Acting Director of the Mint. Dewey and McAdoo did little regarding the Panama–Pacific coins until Congress began to pass the authorizing legislation in early January 1915. Once it had passed both houses, and was awaiting Wilson's signature, Dewey arranged for a meeting in New York with Aitken, Keck, Longman, and Manship. The authorizing act required the Mint to begin delivering coins by the opening date of the fair, February 20, 1915, and although this proved impractical, the Mint still acted quickly. McAdoo approved the choices of Aitken for the $50 pieces, Longman for the quarter eagle, Keck for the dollar, and Manship for the half dollar on January 21. All four artists were already at work, and Aitken responded to the notification of his hiring by submitting designs, which were similar to the actual coins.

By January 29, all four artists had submitted bronze casts of their proposals. Dewey forwarded them to McAdoo, who solicited advice from the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a> (which liked them), his Assistant Secretary, William Malburn (who did not), and Chief Engraver <a href="Charles%20E.%20Barber">Charles E. Barber</a> and others at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> (who offered suggestions). McAdoo had asked that the Mint prepare alternative designs for all the coins, and Barber did so, starting with the half dollar. Rejections to all four of the outside artists were sent on February 5 over McAdoo's signature. The reasons for this are uncertain, as the rejections are terse–Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, in their volume on commemoratives, assert that Malburn's opposition was decisive.

All four outside artists protested. Manship's objections were to no avail; McAdoo selected the design submitted by Barber for the half dollar. Longman asked for an explanation, submitted new designs, and came to Washington to discuss the matter. According to a letter several months later from Dewey, she fell ill there and was unable to participate further; numismatic historian Roger Burdette finds the explanation odd and suggests that there may have been some other reason. Barber was selected to design the quarter eagle. Both Atiken and Keck objected to the Commission of Fine Arts and to McAdoo; Keck also submitted additional designs. Both men met with McAdoo, Malburn and Dewey in Washington, and agreed to changes to their proposed designs. With that done, the $50 and $1 pieces were approved on March 6, 1915. The half dollar was approved two days later. Barber submitted his designs for the quarter eagle on March 16. They met an enthusiastic reception at the Treasury Department, and were approved.

To what extent Mint Assistant Engraver (later Chief Engraver) <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">George T. Morgan</a> should be credited for work on the half dollar and quarter eagle is uncertain; Mint officials and employees were not consistent on this point. Assistant Director <a href="Mary%20M.%20O%27Reilly">Mary M. O'Reilly</a> said in 1936 that the bureau's records indicated that Barber was the designer. Later the same year, she forwarded a statement by an unnamed Philadelphia Mint employee stating that by the very nature of Barber's and Morgan's long association (Morgan was Barber's assistant for 37 years), the two engravers would have conferred frequently, and that Morgan's technique is "very obvious on both sides of both coins". The employee concluded that "no mistake could be made, in my opinion, in crediting both men with the execution of these two coins. I am certain that this is correct." <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a>, in his book on commemoratives, mentions the dispute, credits Barber on the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverses</a> of both coins, and gives both men credit on the reverse of the half dollar. He asserts Morgan created the reverse of the quarter eagle.

The obverse of the half dollar depicts <a href="Liberty%20%28goddess%29">Liberty</a>, who is scattering fruits and flowers from a <a href="cornucopia">cornucopia</a> held by a small, nude child. Behind them, the sun sets beyond San Francisco's <a href="Golden%20Gate">Golden Gate</a>, as yet unadorned by <a href="Golden%20Gate%20Bridge">its bridge</a>. Tom La Marre, in his 1987 article on the Panama–Pacific issue, pointed out that miners regarded the Golden Gate as a sign of good luck, and suggested it might have been better to depict it on a gold coin. The cornucopia, according to Burdette, demonstrates the advancement in trade brought by the canal, though the 1915 "Report of the Director of the Mint" states it "signif[ies] the boundless resources of the West". The obverse is based on Barber's earlier work, especially his medals for the annual <a href="Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>. A representation of waves lies between the sun and the date, representing the maritime themes of the exposition. San Francisco's <a href="mint%20mark">mint mark</a>, S, is to the left of the date. The reverse depicts an eagle atop a <a href="Union%20shield">Union shield</a>, flanked by branches of olive, symbolizing peace, something Swiatek and Breen found ironic given the coin's issuance during World War I, and oak, the latter a choice which they were at a loss to explain. The 1915 Mint Director's report deemed the oak branch an "emblem of strength". Burdette notes that Barber's original design flanked the shield with two dolphins, representing the two oceans joined by the canal, instead of branches, and speculates, "McAdoo either did not understand the allegory, did not care for it, or simply did not like aquatic mammals on coins". McAdoo may also have been suffering from a surfeit of dolphins, as the dollar and octagonal $50 pieces bear them—the ones on the half dollar were removed and replaced by the branches.

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> deemed the obverse of the half dollar "a halfway point between the designs on French silver pieces early in the new century and A. A. Weinman's 'Walking Liberty' for the half dollar". The fifty-cent piece bears the motto "<a href="In%20God%20We%20Trust">In God We Trust</a>", as do the $50 pieces, the first commemorative coins to display it. That motto was first used on U.S. coins in 1864. In the 19th century, it was not mandatory that the motto be used, but it nevertheless appeared on most denominations of U.S. coins by the turn of the 20th century. In 1907 and 1908, there had been many objections to the motto's omission on the gold <a href="Indian%20Head%20eagle">ten dollar</a> and <a href="Saint-Gaudens%20double%20eagle">twenty dollar</a> pieces designed by <a href="Augustus%20Saint-Gaudens">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a>. In response to the public outcry, Congress in 1908 passed legislation requiring its presence on any circulating coin which had previously borne it, as both gold pieces had until 1907. The wording on the Panama–Pacific pieces was left to the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, but officials may have remembered the fracas. Swiatek and Breen suggested that those involved in creating or approving the design may have moved to head off controversy.
Barber's quarter eagle (the first of that denomination issued as a commemorative) depicts, according to the Mint Director's report, "<a href="Columbia%20%28name%29">Columbia</a>, representing the United States, seated [on] the mythical sea horse [a <a href="hippocampus">hippocampus</a>], riding through the waters of the canal, with <a href="caduceus">caduceus</a> in grasp, the emblem of trade and commerce, inviting the nations of the world to use the new way from ocean to ocean. Reverse: American eagle, resting on a standard bearing the motto '<a href="E%20Pluribus%20Unum">E Pluribus Unum</a>' ". The mint mark is on the obverse, to the right of the date. Swiatek and Breen suggested that the caduceus (in modern usage a symbol of medicine) is "said to represent the medical breakthroughs of Col. <a href="William%20C.%20Gorgas">William C. Gorgas</a>'s successful campaign" to control malaria and yellow fever at the canal site. They wrote that on the reverse, the "defiant eagle probably alludes to the necessity of keeping the Canal open during World War I; the whole composition is meant to suggest a Roman legionary standard, which was a pole surmounted by some such device".

The obverse of the quarter eagle, Vermeule opined, derived from coins of ancient Greece depicting a "<a href="Nereid">Nereid</a>, perhaps <a href="Thetis">Thetis</a>, who bears the shield of <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a> astride a hippocamp". He suggested that the quarter eagle obverse "may be Barber's answer to Theodore Roosevelt's and Augustus Saint-Gaudens' clamor for modern coins in the Greek manner". The half dollar's reverse, along with that of the quarter eagle, "are classic symphonies of old designs, motifs that trace back to the eagles and shields of [Charles Barber's predecessors as Chief Engraver] <a href="James%20B.%20Longacre">Longacre</a> and <a href="William%20Barber%20%28engraver%29">William Barber</a> revised into modern form."

Keck's obverse for the dollar was one of the alternative designs submitted to McAdoo, depicting the unadorned, capped head of a Panama Canal construction worker—Keck's original concept had featured <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a>, god of the sea in <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>. The worker, who represents the labor necessary to build the canal, is sometimes mistaken for a baseball player. Keck's reverse contains the words "Panama–Pacific Exposition", "San Francisco", the denomination of the coin, and two dolphins, symbolizing the joining of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by the canal. The mint mark is beneath the letters D and O in "Dollar".

Vermeule called Keck's dollar "a novel, daring use of the limited area afforded by such a small, thin coin. Compared with the earlier gold dollars, the coin is a work of art." Numismatist Arlie Slabaugh, in his volume on commemoratives, noted that the Panama–Pacific dollar "presents a bold American design, completely different from the classical styles used on the other denominations".

Aitken explained his design for the $50 pieces:

The goddess wears a crested helmet, as her Greek equivalent, <a href="Pallas%20Athena">Pallas Athena</a>, was commonly depicted on ancient coins; it is pushed back to signify her peaceful intentions. She wears <a href="mail%20%28armour%29">mail</a>, which Swiatek and Breen found an odd anachronism. She bears upon her shield the Roman numerals MCMXV for the year 1915, the second use of Roman numerals on U.S. coins after the early types of the 1907 <a href="Saint-Gaudens%20double%20eagle">Saint-Gaudens double eagle</a>. Though Aitken had originally expressed the date as "1915" in his original sketches, he soon changed his mind, "As these designs will not be used in any other year, there will be no need to change the year as we must on other coins."

Kevin Flynn, in his book on commemorative coins, described the branch on which the owl perches as that of a <a href="ponderosa%20pine">ponderosa pine</a> tree; several cones are visible. The design on the octagonal piece is smaller than on the round, to allow space for the border featuring the dolphins. The mint mark is on the reverse, adjacent to the rightmost pine cone and directly above the letter "O" in "San Francisco".

The design for the $50 received contemporary criticism; some suggested that the presence of the dolphins on the octagonal coin implied that the canal had been constructed for <a href="cetacean">cetacean</a> convenience. A 1916 column in the "American Journal of Numismatics" contained the conclusion that "the criticism often heard that 'there is nothing American about the coin except the inscription' is fully warranted." Swiatek and Breen dismissed criticisms as "numerous and mostly irrelevant, based on total misreading of the iconography. [McAdoo began it] with stupid claims that Pallas Athena meant nothing on a U.S. coin unless she could be identified with Liberty, and that Athena's owl would never mean anything to all of us". Vermeule deemed the $50 coins "a tour de force, dated to be sure, but unusual enough in all respects to be worthy of what American numismatic art could achieve". Later Chief Engraver <a href="Elizabeth%20Jones%20%28engraver%29">Elizabeth Jones</a> felt that the $50 pieces were "stylistically in step with the period [and have] considerable artistic merits". Jeff Garrett and Ron Guth, in their book on U.S. gold coins, deemed the Panama–Pacific $50 pieces "one of the most stunning issues ever produced by the U.S. government".

Once the designs were approved, the artists prepared bronze casts to be sent to the <a href="Medallic%20Art%20Company">Medallic Art Company</a> in New York. There, <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23H">hubs</a> would be made that the Mint could use to produce coinage dies, as the company could do it faster than could the Mint. The Panama–Pacific issues are the first American coins known to have been produced from hubs provided by a private company—the Medallic Art Company prepared hubs for the 1913 Buffalo nickel, but it is uncertain if they were used. The Panama–Pacific hubs were sent to the Philadelphia Mint, where the Engraving Department, headed by Barber, would produce the necessary dies. Although the authorizing statute required that the coins be struck in San Francisco, all coinage dies at that time were produced by Barber and his assistants in Philadelphia.

By April, <a href="Robert%20W.%20Woolley">Robert W. Woolley</a> had been commissioned as Director of the Mint, and he approved samples of the gold dollar, the first to have work completed, on April 22. He then traveled to San Francisco, and was there when the dies for the dollar arrived on the 27th. When the San Francisco Mint's coiner examined them, they proved to be lacking the mint mark "S", customary on coins produced there. Woolley was not sure if this was intentional, and wired to Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. Joyce on the 29th. Upon learning that it was intentional—Joyce reasoned that as the entire mintage of this, the first commemorative issue to be struck outside Philadelphia, would be produced at San Francisco, there was no need to use a mint mark—Woolley ordered that the dies at San Francisco and in transit be returned to Philadelphia, and new ones produced with the mint mark. Woolley believed that people would assume the coins were struck at Philadelphia, which did not then use a mint mark. Burdette notes that the San Francisco Mint was a source of local pride and the omission of the mint mark would likely have led to widespread protest, and possibly to two <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23V">varieties</a> of each of the new coins: with mint mark, and without. New dollar dies were sent from Philadelphia on May 3, and for the half dollar the following day. Dies for the $50 followed on May 14, and for the quarter eagle on May 27.
Containing of gold and measuring across for the octagonal) and in diameter for the round, the $50 pieces were the largest and heaviest U.S. coins issued until surpassed in 2010 by the <a href="America%20the%20Beautiful%20Silver%20Bullion%20Coins">America the Beautiful Silver Bullion Coins</a>. The octagonal $50 piece is the only U.S. coin that is not round. The facilities at the San Francisco Mint were inadequate to strike such large coins as the $50 pieces, and a hydraulic medal press was shipped from Philadelphia. This press was ceremoniously operated at that mint on June 15, 1915 for the initial striking of $50 octagonal pieces; the first by San Francisco Mint Superintendent T. W. H. Shanahan, for presentation to the exposition's president, Charles C. Moore. The next nine were struck by other dignitaries, including Congressman Kahn. Anyone else present with the price of $100 per coin was then allowed to strike their own piece, and at least three people, including Dewey's wife and the local postmaster, did so.

The Panama–Pacific Exposition Company hired Farran Zerbe to sell the new coins at the fair. Despite the provisions of the law mandating a delivery of coins before the fair's opening, the only government products Zerbe initially had to vend at his "Money of the World" exhibit were a souvenir medal, designed by Aitken and struck by a press operating at the Mint's exhibit, and prints produced by the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Engraving%20and%20Printing">Bureau of Engraving and Printing</a>, also on-site. Sales of the medal were slow, and Zerbe did not have coins to sell until soon after May 8, 1915, when the half dollar and dollar dies were received. Zerbe found the coins hard to sell; many potential purchasers, faced with a plethora of medals, reproductions of Gold Rush-era pioneer gold coins, and other wares from a variety of vendors, did not believe his coins were official government products. Treasury officials agreed to allow him space for a salesperson at the Mint's exhibit, and the two lower denominations were sold there, with orders taken for the $50 pieces. Soon, though, Zerbe stopped selling the gold dollar there, and the rest of the fair's run was marked by conflict between him and Treasury representatives. The full legal allocation for each denomination had been struck, but though Zerbe continued selling coins by mail after the fair closed on December 4, 1915, sales dropped though 1916. Zerbe continued to sell coins on behalf of the exposition until at least November 1916, and at some point, he sold an unknown quantity to himself to supply the future needs of his coin business. The remainder were melted by the Treasury.

The Mint struck 1,500 of each of the two $50 pieces, plus nine extra of the octagonal and ten of the round, to be sent to Philadelphia to await the 1916 meeting of the <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">annual Assay Commission</a>, when they would be available for inspection and testing. Zerbe had arranged for special display boxes and cases. A set of four denominations (with the purchaser's choice of round or octagonal for the $50) cost $100; a set of five cost $200. Copper display frames with two of each coin were said by Slabaugh to have cost $400, but Swiatek, in his 2011 book on commemoratives, indicates that these sets may actually have been given to dignitaries, as no sales receipts or correspondence relating to them are known. A set of the three smaller denominations sold for $7, the half dollar at $1, the gold dollar at $2 or $2.25 (prices may have varied), and the quarter eagle at $4 each.

More of the octagonal $50 pieces were sold than of the round, as the former proved more popular because of the association with the Gold Rush, and because people liked the dolphins. As half of the 3,000 authorized mintage for the $50 pieces were of each variety, this meant more of the round ones would be melted, leaving the round $50 with the lowest distribution of any U.S. commemorative coin, about 483—the runner up being the octagonal with about 645, though sources vary on the exact numbers distributed.

The $50 pieces stood as the highest denomination U.S. coins for many years. In 1986, the Mint began producing the <a href="American%20Gold%20Eagle">American Gold Eagle</a>, also with face value $50. The record was surpassed with the <a href="American%20Platinum%20Eagle">American Platinum Eagle</a> with a face value of $100, in 1997.

<a href="R.S.%20Yeoman">R.S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>", published in 2018, lists the Panama–Pacific half dollar at between $375 and $2,500, depending on condition. The dollar lists at between $525 and $1,775 and the quarter eagle between $1,550 and $6,000. The round $50 piece lists for between about $55,000 and $240,000, and the octagonal for between $55,000 and $245,000 depending on condition.

The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate

The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate, also known as The Destroying Angel and Daemons Inflicting Divine Vengeance on the Wicked and Intemperate and as The Destruction of the Temple of Vice, is an <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> on canvas by English artist <a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a>, first exhibited in 1832. Etty had become famous for <a href="Nude%20%28art%29">nude paintings</a>, and acquired a reputation for tastelessness, indecency and a lack of creativity. With "The Destroying Angel" he hoped to disprove his critics with an openly moral piece. The painting is 127.8 cm by 101.9 cm (50 in by 40 in) and depicts a classical temple under attack from a <a href="destroying%20angel%20%28Bible%29">destroying angel</a> and a group of <a href="Daemon%20%28classical%20mythology%29">daemons</a>. Some of the humans appear dead or unconscious, others flee or struggle against the daemons.

When first exhibited in 1832, "The Destroying Angel" was widely praised for its technical brilliance, but critics were divided on the subject matter. Some praised its vivid blend of fear and beauty; others criticised its theme as inappropriate, and chastised Etty for wasting his talent. As Etty had hoped, the painting changed critics' perception of him; some saw it as indicating previously unseen depths, others considered it a renunciation of his previous work. Henry Payne, who had commissioned the painting, sold it in 1854 to <a href="Joseph%20Whitworth">Sir Joseph Whitworth</a>. Whitworth donated it in 1882 to the <a href="Manchester%20Art%20Gallery">Manchester Art Gallery</a>, where it remains.

<a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a> (1787–1849), the seventh son of a <a href="York">York</a> baker and miller, had originally been an apprentice printer in <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>, but on completing his seven-year apprenticeship at the age of 18 moved to <a href="London">London</a> to become an artist. Strongly influenced by the works of <a href="Titian">Titian</a> and <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Rubens</a>, he became famous for painting <a href="Nude%20%28art%29">nude figures</a> in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Many of his peers greatly admired him, and he was elected a full <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts%23Membership">Royal Academician</a> in 1828, ahead of <a href="John%20Constable">John Constable</a>.

Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 depicted nudes. While some nude paintings by foreign artists existed in private collections, England had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Suppression%20of%20Vice">Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice</a>. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and the reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received, many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent. Etty's "<a href="Youth%20on%20the%20Prow%2C%20and%20Pleasure%20at%20the%20Helm">Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm</a>", completed in 1830 and exhibited in 1832, attracted scathing criticism for its supposed seductive and sensual nature, leading "<a href="The%20Morning%20Chronicle">The Morning Chronicle</a>" to comment that "[Etty] should not persist, with an unhallowed fancy, to pursue Nature to her holy recesses. He is a laborious draughtsman, and a beautiful colourist; but he has not taste or chastity of mind enough to venture on the naked truth."

Needled by repeated attacks from "The Morning Chronicle" on his supposed indecency, poor taste and lack of creativity, Etty determined to produce a work that would prove his detractors wrong. The result was "The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate".

"The Destroying Angel" was commissioned by Henry Payne of Leicester in 1822, on a promise of 60 <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a> (about £ in today's terms) when complete. Payne had granted Etty complete freedom in the creation of the piece, but Etty had done little with the notion until, stung by "The Morning Chronicle"'s criticism, he decided to return to the theme, completing it in 1832. As Etty had become a more prominent painter in the meantime, Payne paid him £130 (about £ in today's terms) for the piece. The work is thought to have been inspired by the works of <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Pope">Alexander Pope</a>, by <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>'s "<a href="The%20Last%20Judgment%20%28Michelangelo%29">The Last Judgment</a>" and possibly by the <a href="July%20Revolution">French Revolution of 1830</a>, in which Etty had been caught up during a visit to Paris to study in the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a>. The topic was one to which Etty felt particularly close, saying that he had put his "whole soul" into the piece.

"The Destroying Angel" is a <a href="visionary%20art">visionary work</a>, depicting a wholly imaginary scene rather than a scene from history, literature or mythology. It measures 127.8 cm by 101.9 cm (50 in by 40 in), and depicts an ornate imaginary <a href="Classical%20architecture">classical temple</a>. The temple and its occupants are under attack from a <a href="destroying%20angel%20%28Bible%29">destroying angel</a> and a group of <a href="Daemon%20%28classical%20mythology%29">daemons</a>, who are in the process of abducting its human occupants. The angel itself is wreathed in smoke in the centre of the image. Having destroyed one side of the temple, it is poised to hurl a <a href="thunderbolt">thunderbolt</a>. Below the angel, daemons attack a group of around 25 semi-naked human figures. Each human is shown in a different position and expresses terror differently, and each is deliberately painted in paler tones than those Etty typically used to suggest death and pallor. As with most of Etty's works, the figures are a collection of depictions of models in studio poses, later arranged for dramatic effect, rather than painted as a group.

To the right of the painting, daemons drag terrified women away. The woman in the lower right-hand corner turns to see flames reflected in the eyes of the daemon who holds her from behind, with a look of horrified guilt on her face. Behind her, other women struggle helplessly with the daemons or are carried away unconscious, having fainted.

In the centre of the foreground is a figure modelled on <a href="Caius%20Gabriel%20Cibber">Caius Gabriel Cibber</a>'s "Raving Madness", which at the time was one of two <a href="monumental%20sculpture">monumental sculpture</a>s above the entrance to <a href="Bethlem%20Royal%20Hospital">Bethlem Hospital</a> ("Bedlam"), and a well-known London landmark and symbol of insanity. The chained figure is contorted in agony struggling to escape his bonds, while a daemon pulls on one end of the chain. Beside this lunatic is an unconscious or dead gambler, his winnings spread on the floor beside him.
Behind the central images of the lunatic, daemon and gambler are a group of people who have only just realised what is happening. A male figure in a red <a href="Phrygian%20cap">Phrygian cap</a> (a symbol of the French and American Revolutions) reclines with his arm around the waist of a female figure (identified as a <a href="maenad">bacchante</a> by Sarah Burnage of the University of York). The female figure shades her eyes, either against the brightness of the angel or to block out the horror taking place in front of her.

On the left-hand side of the painting, in the background, the structure of the temple crumbles and burns in the wake of the angel's path, while figures in varying stages of undress flee the approaching daemons. In the foreground a drunken man mimics the pose of the <a href="Barberini%20Faun">Barberini Faun</a> as he clutches his head, alert enough to realise his fate if he does not escape but too intoxicated to flee.

Around the painting lie corpses in various states of undress. "The Destroying Angel" was painted shortly after Etty's visit to Paris in which he had witnessed the <a href="July%20Revolution">July Revolution</a> at first hand, and the sight and smell of the dead in the streets had left a strong impression on him. The heaped bodies in "The Destroying Angel" were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France, and perhaps also by the <a href="Second%20cholera%20pandemic%20%281829%E2%80%9351%29">cholera epidemic</a> which killed thousands in London in 1832.

"The Destroying Angel" was first exhibited at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20Summer%20Exhibition">Royal Academy Summer Exhibition</a> in 1832. It immediately generated much critical and public interest, and was compared favourably with "<a href="The%20Fall%20of%20the%20Damned">The Fall of the Damned</a>" by <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Peter Paul Rubens</a>, <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>'s "<a href="The%20Last%20Judgment%20%28Michelangelo%29">The Last Judgment</a>" and "Breughell's frightful fancies".
Although the painting was celebrated as a technical accomplishment, some critics were uncertain if it had the correct moral effect. "The Library of the Fine Arts" was critical of its "pantomimic" quality, which it considered "calculated to excite any but such ideas as we should wish to see produced by Art", while "<a href="The%20Examiner%20%281808%E2%80%9386%29">The Examiner</a>" complained about the depiction of women being attacked, arguing: "Mr Etty should not treat the fair sex in this harsh and wanton manner. We doubt his right to put a single one of them into the hands of a Demon, much less to deliver them over by the dozen to the grasp of the destroyers." "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" said, We do not profess to understand what class of compositions that is which originates neither in history nor poetry—no doubt Mr. Etty does; but as far as we can comprehend his picture, which is much more intelligible than his language, it represents a quantity of able-bodied demons, who appear angry at the ladies for having stayed out so long, and who are come to fetch them home accordingly and criticised Etty for a "slovenly manner" and for "abusing his rich gifts, and [wasting] upon the wild and unmeaning what might be made subservient to much more worthy purposes". Despite this, the same critic conceded that "The work is one of extraordinary power" and that "The figures are drawn with exquisite skill, the grouping admirably varied, and yet so combined as to present a complete picture, and the colouring vigorous and harmonious in an eminent degree."

Other critics admired Etty's unusual interpretation of apocalyptic religious imagery, his ability to give distinct characters and shapes to the individual demons and their victims, and the vividness of his imagination. "<a href="The%20Morning%20Post">The Morning Post</a>" particularly praised Etty's ability to convey "creation conceived and thrown upon the canvas with all the fury of poetical inspiration" by combining the "dauntless spirit of a sketch" with the "powerful impression of a finished picture". The prominent art critic <a href="William%20Paulet%20Carey">William Paulet Carey</a> (writing under the name of 'Ridolfi') championed "The Destroying Angel", and in particular Etty's ability to balance beauty, horror and fear without descending into tastelessness. Carey saw Etty as proof that British artistic traditions were equal to any others in the world, and "The Destroying Angel" as evidence of Etty's "redeeming grace and spirit". Etty's long-standing adversaries at "The Morning Chronicle" found little to attack in the painting, their review stating that "The upper part of the picture is masterly, grand and beautiful. The lower part not so well, but some of the figures are in admirable action and fine drawing." The reticence of "The Morning Chronicle" prompted Carey to comment that they were in "envious silence".
Despite some criticism, "The Destroying Angel" changed the way Etty was perceived by critics. They commonly had viewed Etty's works as insights into his mind, generally with the aim of discrediting him for supposed sexual deviancies. Confronted with a piece so obviously intended to convey a moral lesson, many of those same critics felt that Etty had revealed a more moral nature than they had previously believed. Many explicitly saw "The Destroying Angel" as a counterweight to the nude paintings for which Etty was famous, or even a representation of Etty's own repentance for or renunciation of his previous works. "<a href="Fraser%27s%20Magazine">Fraser's Magazine</a>" described the painting as "a sermon to [Etty's] admirers ... where he inflicts poetical justice upon his own gay dames and their gallants, their revels being broken in upon, and they themselves being carried off most unceremoniously, like that "little" gentleman Don Juan, by sundry grim-looking brawny devils".

After 1832, Etty exhibited over 80 more paintings at the Summer Exhibition. He remained a prominent painter of nudes, but from this time made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons. Yet he remained, in the majority view, a pornographer. <a href="Charles%20Robert%20Leslie">Charles Robert Leslie</a> observed shortly after Etty's death that himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds". Etty remained commercially successful in his lifetime, amassing £17,000 (about £ in today's terms) by his death.

Etty died in 1849, and his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity. Interest in him declined over time, and by the end of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. Henry Payne sold "The Destroying Angel" in 1854 for 770 guineas (about £ in today's terms) to <a href="Joseph%20Whitworth">Sir Joseph Whitworth</a>, who donated it in 1882 to the <a href="Manchester%20Art%20Gallery">Manchester Art Gallery</a>, where it remains. The painting was exhibited as part of a major retrospective of Etty's work at the <a href="York%20Art%20Gallery">York Art Gallery</a> in 2011–12.
As Etty had rapidly fallen from fashion, his works had little influence on most subsequent painters. <a href="William%20Edward%20Frost">William Edward Frost</a> was a great admirer of Etty, and Frost's "Una Alarmed by Fauns" (1843) and "Una and the Wood Nymphs" (1847) owe a conscious debt to "The Destroying Angel" in their depiction of a group of semi-clad daemonic and human figures, as does <a href="John%20Everett%20Millais">John Everett Millais</a>'s early work "Cymon and Iphigenia" (1848). As Etty's style became increasingly unpopular, those artists who had imitated him, other than Frost, soon abandoned the style. Etty's biographer Leonard Robinson contends that the later <a href="fairy%20painting">fairy painting</a>s of <a href="Richard%20Dadd">Richard Dadd</a>, which often show large crowds of mythical creatures mingling with humans, were influenced by Etty but concedes that Dadd was likely unconscious of Etty's influence on his style.

250t-class torpedo boat

The 250t class were high-seas <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s built for the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> between 1913 and 1916. A total of 27 boats were built by three shipbuilding companies, with the letter after the boat number indicating the manufacturer. There were small variations between manufacturers, mainly in the <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s used, and whether they had one or two <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnels</a>. The eight boats of the T-group, designated "74 T" – "81 T", were built by <a href="Stabilimento%20Tecnico%20Triestino">Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino</a>, located at <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a>. The sixteen boats of the F-group, "82 F" – "97 F", were built by <a href="Ganz%20Works">Ganz-Danubius</a> at their shipyards at <a href="Rijeka">Fiume</a> and <a href="Kraljevica">Porto Re</a>. The three M-group boats, "98 M" – "100 M", were manufactured by <a href="Cantiere%20Navale%20Triestino">Cantiere Navale Triestino</a> at <a href="Monfalcone">Monfalcone</a>.

All 27 boats saw service in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, undertaking <a href="Anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine operations</a> in the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a>, <a href="shore%20bombardment">shore bombardment</a> missions along its Italian coastline, and <a href="convoy">convoy</a>, escort and <a href="minesweeping">minesweeping</a> tasks. Although widely used during the war, the class suffered no losses, despite taking hits during surface engagements and damage from accidents. In 1917, one of the guns on each boat was placed on an <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> mount. Under the terms of the post-war <a href="Treaty%20of%20Saint-Germain-en-Laye%20%281919%29">Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye</a>, the boats were transferred to various countries, including seven to <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Romania</a>, six to <a href="First%20Portuguese%20Republic">Portugal</a>, six to <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Greece">Greece</a>, and eight to the newly created <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (later Yugoslavia). By 1940, thirteen boats of the class had been lost or <a href="Ship%20breaking">scrapped</a>, including all six Portuguese boats.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the five remaining Greek boats were sunk by <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> aircraft during the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>-led <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">invasion of Greece</a> in April 1941. One Romanian boat was lost during the war, while the two remaining Romanian boats performed escort tasks in the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> before being taken over by the <a href="Soviet%20Navy">Soviet Navy</a>, and serving in the <a href="Black%20Sea%20Fleet">Black Sea Fleet</a> until the end of the war; they were finally stricken in late 1945.

The six surviving Yugoslav boats were captured by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italians</a> during the Axis <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> in April 1941, and were operated by the "<a href="Regia%20Marina">Regia Marina</a>" in a coastal and second-line escort role. Immediately following the Italian <a href="Armistice%20of%20Cassibile">capitulation</a> in September 1943, one ex-Yugoslav boat was sunk by German aircraft, another was <a href="Scuttling">scuttled</a> by its Italian crew, and two more fell back into Yugoslav hands a few months later. The remaining two were seized by the Germans. Of the two ex-Yugoslav boats taken over by the Germans, both were operated by Croatian crews or by the <a href="Navy%20of%20the%20Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Navy of the Independent State of Croatia</a> for some time before being recovered by the Germans. One was destroyed by <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> <a href="Motor%20Torpedo%20Boat">Motor Torpedo Boat</a>s in June 1944, and the other was sunk by <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> aircraft in 1945. The two surviving boats were commissioned by the <a href="Yugoslav%20Navy">Yugoslav Navy</a> after the war, one continuing in service until the early 1960s.

In 1910, the <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a coastal <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>, specifying that it should be capable of sustaining for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that in a future conflict, the <a href="Strait%20of%20Otranto">Strait of Otranto</a>, where the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> meets the <a href="Ionian%20Sea">Ionian Sea</a>, would be <a href="blockade">blockade</a>d by hostile forces. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the southern Adriatic <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> base at <a href="Kotor">Cattaro</a> to the Strait during darkness, locate and attack blockading ships, and return to port before morning. <a href="Steam%20turbine">Steam turbine</a> power was selected for propulsion, as <a href="Marine%20propulsion%23Reciprocating%20diesel%20engines">diesels</a> with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run <a href="Turbo-electric%20transmission">turbo-electric</a> boats.

<a href="Stabilimento%20Tecnico%20Triestino">Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino</a> (STT) of <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> was selected for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other tenderer. Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the STT boats were classified as sea-going. The STT boats used <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> turbines driving two <a href="drive%20shaft">propeller shafts</a>. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when <a href="Ganz%20Works">Ganz-Danubius</a> reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them. These boats were powered by <a href="AEG">AEG</a>-Curtiss turbines, and had two <a href="Funnel%20%28ship%29">funnels</a> rather than the single funnel of the STT boats. The third contract went to <a href="Cantiere%20Navale%20Triestino">Cantiere Navale Triestino</a> (CNT), who used Melms-Pfenniger turbines, and their boats also had two funnels. The boats of all three groups used steam generated by two <a href="Yarrow%20boiler">Yarrow</a> <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s, one of which burned <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> and the other coal.

When completed, all 27 boats were armed with two <a href="%C5%A0koda%20Works">Škoda</a> <a href="%C5%A0koda%207%20cm%20guns"></a> L/30 guns, and four <a href="torpedo%20tubes">torpedo tubes</a>. Each vessel could carry 10–12 <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s.

The T-group were built by STT at the <a href="Port%20of%20Trieste">Port of Trieste</a> between April 1913 and December 1914. They had a <a href="waterline%20length">waterline length</a> of , a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a normal <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . While their designed displacement was , they displaced about fully loaded. The crew consisted of 39 officers and enlisted men. Their Parsons turbines were rated at with a maximum output of and the boats were designed to reach a top speed of . They carried of coal and of fuel oil, which gave them a range of at .

The T-group boats were originally to be armed with three L/30 guns, and three torpedo tubes, but this was changed to two guns and four torpedo tubes before the first boat was completed, to standardise the armament with the following F-group. In 1914, one <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a> was added.

When "74 T"'s turbines were initially installed, the problems with them were so significant that all her power and propulsion machinery had to be rebuilt. She was launched for a second time on 26 June 1914.

The F-group were built by Ganz & Danubius at <a href="Rijeka">Fiume</a> and nearby <a href="Kraljevica">Porto Re</a> between October 1913 and December 1916. They had a waterline length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . While their designed displacement was , they displaced about fully loaded. The crew consisted of 38 officers and enlisted men. Their AEG-Curtiss turbines were rated at with a maximum output of , and the boats were designed to reach a top speed of . During trials, "93 F" produced , and reached a top speed of . They carried of coal and of fuel oil, which gave them a range of at .
When <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italy</a> declared war on Austria-Hungary in May 1915, five incomplete F-group boats were towed to be completed in safety. "82 F", "83 F" and "84 F" were taken from Porto Re to <a href="Pula">Pola</a>, and "90 F" and "91 F" were taken to <a href="Novigrad%2C%20Zadar%20County">Novigrad</a>. This resulted in delays to the completion of these boats.

The M-group were built by CNT at <a href="Monfalcone">Monfalcone</a> between March 1914 and March 1916. They had a waterline length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . Their designed displacement was , and they displaced about fully loaded. The crew consisted of 38 officers and enlisted men. Their Melms-Pfenniger turbines were rated at with a maximum output of , and the boats were designed to reach a top speed of . They carried enough coal and fuel oil to give them a range of at .

At the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, "74 T" – "77 T" comprised the 1st Torpedo Group of the 3rd Torpedo Craft Division of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Torpedo Craft Flotilla. All 27 boats saw service, performing <a href="convoy">convoy</a>, escort and <a href="minesweeping">minesweeping</a> tasks, <a href="Anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine operations</a>, and <a href="shore%20bombardment">shore bombardment</a> missions. They also conducted patrols and supported <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> raids against the Italian coast. Due to inadequate funding, the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for "high seas" operations. On 24 May 1915, several 250t-class boats were involved in the shelling of various Italian shore-based targets known as the <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Ancona">Bombardment of Ancona</a>. "74 T" – "77 T" were part of the operation against <a href="Ancona">Ancona</a>, and "78 T" – "81 T" were involved in the shelling of <a href="Port%20of%20Ravenna">Porto Corsini</a> near Ravenna. In the latter action, an Italian <a href="Coastal%20artillery">shore battery</a> returned fire, hitting the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> and damaging "80 T". On 23 July, "74 T" and "78 T" participated in a shore bombardment and landing operation led by the <a href="scout%20cruiser">scout cruiser</a> against <a href="San%20Benedetto%20del%20Tronto">San Benedetto del Tronto</a>, <a href="Ortona">Ortona</a> and <a href="Termoli">Termoli</a> on the central Adriatic coast of Italy. In late November 1915, the Austro-Hungarian fleet deployed a force from its main fleet base at Pola to Cattaro in the southern Adriatic; this force included six of the T-group torpedo boats. This force was tasked to maintain a permanent patrol of the Albanian coastline and interdict any troop transports crossing from Italy.

On 3 February 1916, "83 F", "87 F" and "88 F" were involved in another shore bombardment operation against Ortona and <a href="San%20Vito%20Chietino">San Vito Chietino</a>, this time led by the <a href="armoured%20cruiser">armoured cruiser</a> . Three days later, the scout cruiser , "74 T", "78 T", "80 T", "83 F", "87 F" and "88 F" were intercepted by the British light cruiser and French <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> north of <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durazzo</a> in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between "74 T" and "83 F". On 3 May, "76 T", "92 F", "93 F" and "98 M" – "100 M" were accompanying four destroyers when they were involved in a surface action off Porto Corsini against an Italian force led by the <a href="flotilla%20leader">flotilla leader</a>s <a href="Italian%20cruiser%20Cesare%20Rossarol">"Cesare Rossarol"</a> and <a href="Italian%20cruiser%20Guglielmo%20Pepe">"Guglielmo Pepe"</a>. On this occasion the Austro-Hungarian force retreated behind a minefield with no damage to the torpedo boats, and only <a href="Fragmentation%20%28weaponry%29">splinter</a> damage to the . On 24 May, an Austro-Hungarian force that included "75 T", "89 F", "92 F", "98 M" – "100 M" and four destroyers was involved in a brief surface action with two Italian torpedo boats off <a href="Chioggia">Chioggia</a> in the northern Adriatic. During the action, "75 T" was hit. On the night of 31 May – 1 June 1916, the s and , accompanied by "77 T", "79 T" and "81 T", raided the <a href="Otranto%20Barrage">Otranto Barrage</a>, the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied</a> naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto. "Orjen" sank one <a href="Naval%20drifter">drifter</a>, but once the alarm had been raised, the Austro-Hungarian force withdrew.

On 9 July, "Novara" led a force which included "87 F" and two s in another night raid on the Otranto Barrage which resulted in the sinking of two drifters. On 2 August, the "Huszár"-class destroyers and were returning from a shore bombardment of <a href="Molfetta">Molfetta</a> on the southern Adriatic coast of Italy when they were engaged by an Allied force which included the and the British cruiser . The <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a> , "80 T" and "85 F" were sent to assist the two destroyers, but action was broken off before the opposing cruisers got within range. Nine days later, "91 F", "94 F" and "98 M" were chased and engaged by Italian torpedo boats off Pola, resulting in splinter damage to one of the Italian boats. On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by "83 F", "87 F" and "88 F". The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of <a href="Sant%27Elpidio%20a%20Mare">Sant'Elpidio a Mare</a>.

During 1917, one of the guns on each boat was placed on an <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> mount. On 21 April, four Austro-Hungarian destroyers, accompanied by "84 F", "92 F", "94 F" and "100 M", conducted a night raid on the Otranto Barrage, sinking one drifter. On 11 May, the British <a href="submarine">submarine</a> stalked "78 T" off Pola, firing two torpedoes at her. The British captain had kept his submarine's <a href="periscope">periscope</a> extended too far and for too long, and the tell-tale "feather" alerted the crew of "78 T", allowing her to avoid the incoming torpedoes. That night, the destroyer "Csikós", accompanied by "78 T", "93 F" and "96 F", were pursued in the northern Adriatic by an Italian force of five destroyers, but were able to retire to safety behind a minefield. On 14–15 May 1917, several 250t-class boats were part of the support forces for a major raid on the Otranto Barrage. When the raiding force departed, torpedo boats and aircraft secured the approaches to the Austro-Hungarian naval base at Cattaro. Once the raiding force had departed for the barrage, "Sankt Georg", a destroyer, and "84 F", "88 F", "99 M" and "100 M" were to be prepared to sortie out to support the raiders on their return voyage. The old <a href="coastal%20defence%20ship">coastal defence ship</a> and "86 F", "91 F" and "95 F" were also available at Cattaro if needed. Although the raid was a success, sinking 14 drifters, the raiding force was then engaged by Allied ships in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Otranto%20Straits">Battle of the Otranto Straits</a>. Both support groups sailed to meet the returning Austro-Hungarian force, including the heavily damaged "Novara", which was under tow. On marrying-up with the raiding force, the torpedo boats fanned out to screen the larger warships, protecting them as they returned to port.

On 3 June, the destroyers "Wildfang" and "Csikós", along with "93 F" and "96 F", briefly encountered three Italian <a href="MAS%20%28motorboat%29">MAS boats</a> off the mouth of the <a href="Tagliamento">Tagliamento</a> river in the far north of the Adriatic. On 23 September, "77 T" and "78 T" were laying a minefield off <a href="Grado%2C%20Friuli-Venezia%20Giulia">Grado</a> in the northern Adriatic when they had a brief encounter with an Italian MAS boat. The following night, "94 F" and three other torpedo boats again had a short and inconclusive engagement with Italian torpedo boats in the northern Adriatic. On 29 September, "90 F", "94 F" and "98 M" were accompanying a squadron of four destroyers supporting an air attack on the Italian airfield at <a href="Ferrara">Ferrara</a> by <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a>s. After destroying an Italian <a href="airship">airship</a>, the squadron withdrew at high speed in the darkness, but was intercepted by an Italian squadron of eight destroyers that had been sent to support an Italian air raid on Pola. In the resultant 45 minute chase towards <a href="Pore%C4%8D">Parenzo</a>, two Italian destroyers and three Austro-Hungarian destroyers were damaged, and "94 F" was hit by splinters. As the squadron retreated through the minefields off Parenzo, "98 M" was also hit by Italian fire, resulting in one casualty.

On 14 November, "84 F", "92 F", "94 M", "99 M" and "100 M" encountered four Italian destroyers off the mouth of the <a href="Piave%20%28river%29">Piave</a>, but the torpedo boats were again able to elude their pursuers by sailing behind a minefield. Two days later, the coastal defence ships and "Budapest" sailed to engage a Italian shore battery at Cortellazzo near the mouth of the Piave, with an escort that included "84 F", "92 F", "94 F", "98 M" – "100 M" and some <a href="minesweeper">minesweeper</a>s. Both "Wien" and "Budapest" were hit, but none of the torpedo boats suffered any damage. After an Italian force of seven destroyers and three MAS boats appeared, the bombarding force withdrew. On 28 November, 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the first mission, "79 T", "86 F" and "90 F" supported the bombardment of <a href="Senigallia">Senigallia</a> by three destroyers, before they were joined by "78 T", "82 F", "87 F", "89 F" and "95 F" and another three destroyers for the bombardment of Porto Corsini, <a href="Marotta%20%28village%29">Marotta</a> and <a href="Cesenatico">Cesenatico</a>. On 19 December, a large Austro-Hungarian force engaged the Italian shore battery at Cortellazzo. The force consisted of the <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a> , the light cruiser , "Budapest", six destroyers, ten torpedo boats including "84 F", "92 F", "94 F" and "98 M" – "100 M", and ten minesweepers. None of the ships of the bombarding force suffered damage during the mission.

Elements of the Austro-Hungarian fleet <a href="Cattaro%20Mutiny">mutinied in Cattaro</a> in February 1918, and in May, a plot was discovered to take over "80 T" at Pola. The motive appeared to be nationalism. Two of the ringleaders, a <a href="Czechs">Czech</a> and a Dalmatian <a href="Croats">Croat</a>, were tried, convicted and executed by firing squad. On 13 May, the destroyer , "84 F" and "98 M" were at Durazzo when two Italian MAS boats forced the harbour, sinking one Austro-Hungarian freighter. On 10 June, "76 T""79 T", "81 T" and "87 F" were part of the escort force that failed to protect the Austro-Hungarian <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a> from the Italian MAS boats that sank her. During that action, "76 T" fired at the Italian boats, but did not score a hit. On 1 July, the destroyers "Balaton" and "Csikós", along with "83 F" and "88 F", were chased offshore from <a href="Caorle">Caorle</a> by seven Italian destroyers. All four Austro-Hungarian ships were hit, with "83 F" hit three times, and "88 F" struck once. One of the Italian destroyers was hit three times, and another was slightly damaged by splinters. On 6 September, "86 F" and two other torpedo boats were engaged by three Italian destroyers in the <a href="Drin%20%28river%29">Gulf of Drin</a>. "86 F" was hit, and the Austro-Hungarian force withdrew. On 2 October, "87 F" was at Durazzo when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy.

Under the provisions of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Saint-Germain-en-Laye%20%281919%29">Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye</a>, all Austro-Hungarian warships were surrendered to the Allies. The 250t-class torpedo boats were distributed among <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Romania</a>, <a href="First%20Portuguese%20Republic">Portugal</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Greece">Greece</a>, and the newly created <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (later Yugoslavia), as follows:

By 1940, thirteen boats of the class had been lost or scrapped, including all six Portuguese boats. At the time of the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> in April 1941, the Yugoslav boats "T1" and "T3" were assigned to the Southern Sector of Coastal Defence Command based at the Bay of Kotor, along with several minesweepers and other craft. "T5"–"T8" comprised the 3rd Torpedo Division located at <a href="%C5%A0ibenik">Šibenik</a>. On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of <a href="Zadar">Zadar</a> on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of <a href="Zaton%2C%20Zadar%20County">Zaton</a> into <a href="Lake%20Prokljan">Lake Prokljan</a>, where they remained until 11 April. On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at <a href="Milna">Milna</a> on the island of <a href="Bra%C4%8D">Brač</a>, and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor. All six Yugoslav boats were then captured by the Italians.

The five surviving Greek boats were all sunk by aircraft during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">German invasion of Greece</a>, also in April 1941. The first was "Proussa", which was sunk off Corfu on 4 April by Italian <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2087">Junkers Ju 87</a> "Picchiatellos" of the 239th Squadron, 97th Dive Bomber Group. Later, "Kios" was sunk off <a href="Athens">Athens</a> on 22 April, "Kyzikos" at <a href="Salamis%20Naval%20Base">Salamis</a> on 24 April, "Pergamos" off Salamis on 25 April, and "Kydoniai" south of the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a> peninsula on the following day, all by German aircraft.

The three Romanian boats were initially deployed against the <a href="Soviet%20Navy">Soviet Navy</a> <a href="Black%20Sea%20Fleet">Black Sea Fleet</a> following the launch of <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a> in June 1941. "<a href="NMS%20N%C4%83luca">Năluca</a>" took part in the <a href="Action%20of%209%20July%201941">sinking of one Soviet submarine</a> near <a href="Mangalia">Mangalia</a> on 9 July 1941, but was herself sunk by Soviet aircraft at <a href="Constan%C8%9Ba">Constanța</a> on 20 August 1944. "<a href="NMS%20Sborul">Sborul</a>" and "<a href="NMS%20Smeul">Smeul</a>" survived World War II, having been transferred to the Soviet Black Sea Fleet in late August 1944 after Romania changed sides and joined the Allies, serving as "Musson" and "Toros" respectively.

The Yugoslav boats served in a coastal and second-line escort role with the <a href="Regia%20Marina">Royal Italian Navy</a> () in the Adriatic under their Yugoslav designations, and were fitted with two L/30 anti-aircraft guns in place of their 66 mm guns, but no other significant alterations were made to them. After the Italians <a href="Armistice%20of%20Cassibile">capitulated</a> in September 1943, they transferred "T1" back to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year. "T3" was seized by the Germans at Rijeka on 16 September 1943 and was renamed "TA48". She was commissioned on 15 August 1944, and was used for patrol and escort work in the northern Adriatic. The Germans added to her armament, fitting her with two single anti-aircraft guns in addition to the guns fitted by the Italians, and removing two of her torpedo tubes. There are two versions of how "TA48" was employed. The first version indicates that she was crewed exclusively by Croatian officers and sailors, but remained under German control, and the second states that she was handed over to the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, but was repossessed by the Germans on 14 December 1944 because they considered the Croatians unreliable. Her complement was also increased to 52 during her German-Croatian service. She was sunk in the port of Trieste by <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> aircraft on 20 February 1945.

"T5" was also returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December 1943. "T6" was scuttled by the Italians north of <a href="Rimini">Rimini</a> on 11 September as she had insufficient fuel on board to reach an Allied port. Once under German control, "T7" was also handed over to the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, and served under her Yugoslav designation. Her crew came under the influence of <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Yugoslav Partisan</a> propaganda, and were preparing to mutiny when the Germans intervened. On 24 June 1944, she and the <a href="E-boat">S-boats</a> "S 154" and "S 157" of the 7th S-Boat Flotilla were sailing between Šibenik and Rijeka, protecting German sea supply routes along the Adriatic, when they were attacked by the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> <a href="Fairmile%20D%20motor%20torpedo%20boat">Fairmile D motor torpedo boat</a>s "MTB 659", "MTB 662" and "MTB 670" near the island of Kukuljari, south of <a href="Murter">Murter Island</a>. The MTBs fired two torpedoes at "T7", but missed, so they closed and engaged her with their guns, setting her ablaze. She was beached, and 21 crew were rescued by the MTBs. The British crews later examined the wreck, capturing five more crew, then destroyed her with demolition charges. "T8" was sunk north-west of <a href="Dubrovnik">Dubrovnik</a> by German aircraft while evacuating Italian troops from Dalmatia on 10 or 11 September 1943.

Only four of the twenty-seven 250t-class torpedo boats survived World War II, two in Yugoslav service and two in Soviet service. "T1" was commissioned by the <a href="Yugoslav%20Navy">Yugoslav Navy</a> after the war as "Golešnica". She was re-armed with two guns on single mounts and four guns, and her torpedo tubes were removed. She continued in Yugoslav service under that name until October 1959. "T5" was also commissioned by the Yugoslav Navy after the war, and renamed "Cer". She was fitted with two guns on single mounts and one gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up. "Musson" and "Toros" were returned to Romania in October 1945, and stricken the following month.

Denbies

Denbies is a large estate to the northwest of <a href="Dorking">Dorking</a> in <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>, England. A farmhouse and surrounding land originally owned by John Denby was purchased in 1734 by <a href="Jonathan%20Tyers">Jonathan Tyers</a>, the proprietor of <a href="Vauxhall%20Gardens">Vauxhall Gardens</a> in London, and converted into a weekend retreat. The house he built appears to have been of little architectural significance, but the Gothic garden he developed in the grounds on the theme of death achieved some notoriety, despite being short-lived. The estate was bought by <a href="Baron%20King">Lord King</a> of <a href="Ockham%2C%20Surrey">Ockham</a> following Tyers' death in 1767, and the macabre artefacts he had installed, including two stone coffins topped by human skulls, were removed.

<a href="Joseph%20Denison%20%28banker%29">Joseph Denison</a>, a wealthy banker, purchased the estate in about 1787, and it remained in the Denison family until 1849, when it passed to <a href="Thomas%20Cubitt">Thomas Cubitt</a>, a master builder. At the time, Cubitt was working on <a href="Osborne%20House">Osborne House</a> for <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> and <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a>, and the mansion he designed to replace the old one was a more modest version of Osborne. It was still a substantial building though, in the <a href="Italianate%20architecture">Italianate</a> style, with almost 100 rooms on three storeys.

The payment of <a href="inheritance%20tax">death duties</a> and the difficulty of maintaining a large estate during the Second World War forced the Cubitt family to begin selling packets of land. Cubitt's mansion was abandoned until its demolition in 1953, by which time the family was living in a <a href="Regency%20architecture">Regency</a>-style house converted from the housing that had been provided for the garden and stable staff in more affluent times.

What remained of the estate – about  – was put on the market in 1984 and bought by <a href="Biwater">Biwater</a>, a water-treatment company. Two years later the company chairman <a href="Adrian%20White%20%28businessman%29">Adrian White</a> established <a href="Denbies%20Wine%20Estate">Denbies Wine Estate</a>, using on a south-facing piece of land to plant vines.

A farmhouse originally owned by John Denby in the mid-16th century, after whom the estate is named, stood at the heart of Denbies. The lands were sold by William Wakefield (or Wakeford) to <a href="Jonathan%20Tyers">Jonathan Tyers</a> in 1734, to be developed as a weekend retreat. Tyers was the owner of London's <a href="Vauxhall%20Gardens">Vauxhall Gardens</a> – known at that time as New Spring Gardens – and was responsible for developing that venue into a "fashionable place of evening entertainment". A simple two-storey house in the <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> style was built by converting some of the old farm buildings. Set on top of a hillside about northwest of <a href="Dorking">Dorking</a>, the house had views of the Surrey landscape and backed onto <a href="Ranmore%20Common">Ranmore Common</a>. Tyers installed a well beside the house; a note in "<a href="The%20Gentleman%27s%20Magazine">The Gentleman's Magazine</a>" of 1781 gives the well's measurements, recorded on 4 October 1764, as being in diameter and reaching a depth of . On that day it contained water to a depth of supplied from a spring. The front of the house had a pediment in the central wing decorated with a coat of arms; the rooms were not large but were conveniently situated. According to historian Brian Allen the house was not architecturally significant and scant information is available about it; the garden established by Tyers, however, gained notoriety.

In contrast to the cheerful, brightly lit atmosphere of Vauxhall, the garden Tyers developed at Denbies was of a more Gothic nature. Its theme was ""memento mori" (or 'reminders of death')", and the development was given the name of "The Valley of the Shadow of Death". Tyers continued to live in his house in the grounds of Vauxhall after purchasing Denbies, visiting the latter only on Sundays, which has been suggested may go some way towards explaining the garden's gloomy nature. David Coke and Alan Borg, authors of "Vauxhall Gardens: A History" (2012), have alternatively suggested that the mood of the garden may have been symptomatic of "some sort of psychological imbalance" within Tyers, perhaps even "a form of <a href="bipolar%20disorder">bipolar disorder</a>". The garden's main feature was a wooded area of about , "Il Penseroso", which was criss-crossed by a labyrinthine network of paths leading down to a small tributary of the <a href="River%20Mole">River Mole</a>.
Just outside the entrance to the wood was a small hermitage known as The Temple of Death. It had a thatched roof and internal enclosures formed by fake stonework panels, each covered in verses reminding the reader of "the vanity, the shortness and insufficiency of human pleasures". To the right-hand side of the temple entrance, hidden out of sight, was a clock that chimed every minute, which in the words of <a href="William%20Bowyer%20%28printer%29">William Bowyer</a>, was "admonishing us that Time is fleeting, and even the least portion of it to be employed in reflections on Eternity"; it was faced on the opposite side by a large white raven with a label in its mouth conveying the same message. Chained to a sloping desk in the centre of the temple was a copy of <a href="Edward%20Young">Edward Young</a>'s poem "Night-Thoughts" and <a href="Robert%20Blair%20%28poet%29">Robert Blair</a>'s "The Grave", bound in black leather.

At the end of the temple farthest from the door was a substantial monument to <a href="Robert%20Petre%2C%208th%20Baron%20Petre">Robert Petre</a>, a renowned 18th-century <a href="horticulture">horticulturist</a>. Executed in <a href="stucco">stucco</a> and probably crafted by <a href="Louis-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Roubiliac">Roubiliac</a>, it depicted an angel blowing the <a href="Last%20Judgement">last trump</a>, causing a stone pyramid to crumble and revealing the corpse within to be rising from the dead.

Visitors were met at the entrance to the wood by the Latin inscription "Procul este, profani", which translates as "away all you who are unhallowed", a quotation from the sixth book of <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>". The iron entrance gate was mounted between two upended stone coffins supporting the <a href="portico">portico</a>, each one topped by a human skull, one male one female. Each coffin was inscribed with a poem, addressed to the male and female visitor respectively. One proclaimed that "Men, at their best state, are altogether vanity", while the other reminded women that "beauty is vain". The author of the poems is unknown, but may have been <a href="Soame%20Jenyns">Soame Jenyns</a>, although topographer <a href="Edward%20Wedlake%20Brayley">Edward Brayley</a> was not entirely convinced this was correct.

A large alcove close by in the garden, entered through a portal of grey Sussex marble, formed an amphitheatre that contained an effigy representing <a href="Truth">Truth</a> crushing a mask, again probably the work of Roubiliac. It drew the visitor's attention towards two life-sized pictures by <a href="Francis%20Hayman">Francis Hayman</a>, depicting a <a href="Christians">Christian</a> and an <a href="Infidel">Unbeliever</a> as they died, set into compartments in the wall.

Following Tyers' death in 1767 the estate was sold to <a href="Baron%20King">Lord King</a> of <a href="Ockham%2C%20Surrey">Ockham</a>. The macabre artefacts were removed and the grounds extensively altered.

Soon after Lord King's death, in 1781, his son sold the estate to James White. It remained in White's ownership for six years until around 1787, when it was purchased by <a href="Joseph%20Denison%20%28banker%29">Joseph Denison</a>, a wealthy banker.

Denison was brought up in West Yorkshire. His parents were of low rank and had little means, and it is unclear how he made his fortune. It seems that he moved to London, where he fell in with the Heywood family of bankers, later becoming a partner in their company. <a href="Richard%20Vickerman%20Taylor">Richard Vickerman Taylor</a> described the immense wealth Denison accumulated as being gained through "unabated industry and the most rigid frugality". Five years after purchasing Denbies, the Seamere estate, near Scarborough, Yorkshire, was added to his portfolio after he acquired it from the <a href="Duke%20of%20Leeds">Duke of Leeds</a>. Denison had a son, <a href="William%20Joseph%20Denison">William Joseph</a>, and two daughters, <a href="Elizabeth%20Conyngham%2C%20Marchioness%20Conyngham">Elizabeth</a> and Anna Maria, with his second wife. By the time of the <a href="Regency%20era">Regency era</a> the family were the personification of prosperity and <a href="social%20status">social status</a>. Denison senior died in 1806 and the estate and all other properties were inherited by his son, who added to the acreage of the estate by purchasing additional land from the <a href="Earl%20of%20Verulam">Earl of Verulam</a> and the <a href="Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Duke of Norfolk</a>. A new driveway was installed, entering from the direction of <a href="Mickleham%2C%20Surrey">Mickleham</a> via some woodland, replacing the steep roadway that came from Dorking. Writing in 1830, topographer <a href="Thomas%20Allen%20%28topographer%29">Thomas Allen</a> described the expansive well-designed gardens as being under the direction of a "scientific and experienced horticulturist". The lawns at the front of the mansion featured sprinklings of evergreens and shrubs together with formal low-level flower beds. Local people were permitted access to the estate grounds.

Like his father, Denison junior was a banker and became a senior partner in his father's banking company, Denison, Heywood, and Kennard, of <a href="Lombard%20Street%2C%20London">Lombard Street, London</a>. He continued to add to the wealth inherited from his father, and when he died a bachelor on 2 August 1849 he was probably one of the ten richest British businessmen of his era. He left his fortune, estimated at £2.3 million, to his nephew <a href="Albert%20Denison%2C%201st%20Baron%20Londesborough">Albert</a>, on condition that he changed his surname from Conyngham to Denison. Albert was elevated to <a href="Baron%20Londesborough">Baron Londesborough</a> on 4 March 1850, and later that year he sold the estate at Denbies to the master builder, <a href="Thomas%20Cubitt">Thomas Cubitt</a>.

Cubitt was originally a carpenter and, like Denison senior, had acquired his wealth through his own business acumen, building up a successful company and business empire. At the time he purchased Denbies, Cubitt was nearing completion of the work on <a href="Osborne%20House">Osborne House</a> for <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> and <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a> on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>. Cubitt wanted a mansion of his own to emulate that of the neighbouring Georgian country house of <a href="Deepdene%20%28garden%29">Deepdene</a> owned by the affluent Hope family of bankers and at that time in the possession of <a href="Henry%20Thomas%20Hope">Henry Thomas Hope</a>, a patron of the arts. For the practical purpose of continuing to reside in the existing house while building took place, the new mansion was constructed on a site slightly to the southwest of its predecessor, which was demolished once the new mansion was completed in 1854.

Constructed to Cubitt's own designs, the new mansion had a very similar style to that of Osborne House. Cubitt's attention to detail was such that he even manufactured his own bricks at a <a href="brickworks">brickworks</a> he set up for the purpose, using lime extracted from the chalk quarries on the eastern edge of the estate. Almost one hundred rooms made up the <a href="Italianate%20architecture">Italianate</a> structure's three storeys, stretching across nine <a href="Bay%20%28architecture%29">bays</a> in a square formation. Cubitt contrived his own form of <a href="soundproofing">soundproofing</a> by concealing seashells between levels. The flat roof was edged with a parapet embellished with balustrades, and a matching decoration was incorporated round the first floor, both made from <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a>. <a href="Gibbs%20surround">Gibbs surround</a>s were used on the windows on the ground floor whereas triangular <a href="pediment">pediment</a>s featured on the windows included on the three central <a href="cant%20%28architecture%29">canted</a> bays of the first floor. Segmented pediments adorned all the remaining windows. The water supply was provided by the well installed by Tyers, which was close to the southeast corner of the new mansion, via a corridor that spanned the entire outside of the mansion. The entrance had an attached <a href="porte-coch%C3%A8re">porte-cochère</a> enabling visitors to gain undercover access to the outer hall directly from their transport.

Internally, the ground floor of the west wing housed the dining room, service areas and led through to the kitchen and bakehouse. The service area was fitted with a <a href="mezzanine">mezzanine</a> floor to provide sleeping facilities for male servants; the sleeping quarters for female servants were on the top floor of the mansion to keep the two sexes a good distance away from each other. On the same level, the east wing had a study with ante-room set in the northwest corner, a <a href="boudoir">boudoir</a>, two drawing rooms and a billiard room. An expansive library, divided into sections by pillars, was between the boudoir and study, beside the large bay window. The first floor, accessed via the main staircase positioned within the entrance hall, had all the family bedrooms, and featured balconies. <a href="Sitz%20bath">Hip baths</a> were carried to the bedrooms each evening as no bathrooms were incorporated. Cubitt had furniture workshops in London where the majority of the mansion's furnishings and fittings were crafted from mahogany. Nurseries were on the top floor beside the female servant accommodation. Around thirty rooms made up the basement, among them a smoking room where editions of "<a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>" and "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20London%20News">The Illustrated London News</a>" were supplied as reading material. The remaining rooms on the basement level were workshops, wine cellars and individual parlours for the butler, housekeeper and other principal servants, together with general storerooms.

Adjoining the mansion, accessed through a conservatory so there was no need to go outside in inclement weather, an expansive collection of glasshouses and conservatories stretched for . These were maintained by thirteen staff under the jurisdiction of a head gardener. The <a href="kitchen%20garden">kitchen garden</a> occupied about .

Prince Albert visited the estate in July 1851, and planted two trees in front of the terrace to commemorate his visit. There was speculation that the mansion was to be used as a residence for Prince Albert's <a href="Edward%20VII">eldest son</a> and newspapers carried reports that the commemorative trees were possibly "intended to grow up side by side with England's future monarch"; Cubitt strongly denied the suggestion, and on 14 April 1855 he had a rejection of the rumour included in "<a href="Building%20%28magazine%29">The Builder</a>". The grounds had been well maintained by the Denisons, but Cubitt further enhanced and overhauled them; large plantations of <a href="hardwood">hardwood</a>s and <a href="Pinophyta">conifers</a> were added, and general improvements and development of the estate and farm were undertaken. Specimens of rare plants and shrubs were added, sourced through <a href="William%20Jackson%20Hooker">William Hooker</a>, the director of <a href="Kew%20Gardens">Kew Gardens</a>, who was a friend of Cubitt's. <a href="William%20Andrews%20Nesfield">William Nesfield</a> was commissioned to design the gardens.

Access routes to the estate were also added to and enhanced; there were three driveways giving approaches from the <a href="North%20Downs">North Downs</a>, Dorking and from the railway at the west. Cubitt was responsible for building a siding on the north side of <a href="Dorking%20West%20railway%20station">Dorking Town railway station</a>, which was initially used for trains delivering building materials required for the mansion's construction.

Following Cubitt's death at Denbies on 20 December 1855, his assets were valued at more than £1 million. The estate passed to Cubitt's eldest son, <a href="George%20Cubitt%2C%201st%20Baron%20Ashcombe">George</a>, who continued the development and expansion of the property and local area. George had lived at Denbies since his father purchased it, and it remained his main residence until 1905 after the death of his wife, Laura, whom he had married in June 1853. He was a politician, first elected as a <a href="member%20of%20parliament">member of parliament</a> in 1860, and was elevated to a peerage in 1892, becoming the first <a href="Baron%20Ashcombe">Lord Ashcombe</a>. The couple had eight children, three sons and five daughters; two of the boys died as babies, only the youngest son, <a href="Henry%20Cubitt%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Ashcombe">Henry</a>, survived to inherit the estate after his father's death.

During a period of expansion and prosperity under the ownership of Ashcombe a further of land were secured, and gradually other acquisitions were made; the estate then stretched as far as Birtley Court, near <a href="Bramley%2C%20Surrey">Bramley</a> and <a href="Churt">Churt</a>. As a landlord and employer – by that time he had about 400 workers on the estate – he was a benevolent master and ensured he fulfilled his obligations. He commissioned <a href="George%20Gilbert%20Scott">Sir George Gilbert Scott</a>, a friend and regular guest at Denbies, to design an estate church on Ranmore Common. Completed in 1859, it was named after <a href="Barnabas">St Barnabas</a>. Ashcombe also ensured that the basic medical needs of his workers were attended to, by having a cottage built to serve as a dispensary and a place for physicians from the nearby towns to hold twice-weekly surgeries. The cottage was also the venue for a domestic training school where the daughters of his workers received a year of education in the rudiments of domestic service before either being employed in his household or those of other country houses.

Lord Ashcombe's son, Henry, married Maud, whose father was Colonel Archibald Motteaux Calvert, in 1890. The couple lived on the estate near Bramley and had six sons. Their three eldest sons were killed in the First World War while on active service. Like his father, Henry followed a political career, becoming <a href="Lord%20Lieutenant%20of%20Surrey">Lord Lieutenant of Surrey</a> in 1905; that year Henry moved to the mansion house after his father decamped to London following the death of Henry's mother. He inherited the title and extensive estate after the death of his father in 1917. The payment of <a href="inheritance%20tax">death duties</a> and the upkeep of large estates during the war resulted in large parts of the estate being auctioned on 19 September 1921. A total of £30,400 was raised by the sale of sixty-nine lots – tallying around  – of land and property on the periphery of the estate just south of the railway line. Further land situated closer to Dorking town centre was sold for development in the 1930s. The break up of the estate continued after Henry's death on 27 October 1947 when it was inherited by his fourth son <a href="Roland%20Cubitt%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Ashcombe">Roland</a>, who became the third Lord Ashcombe.

Roland was born on 26 January 1899 and initially followed a career in the army. He married <a href="Sonia%20Rosemary%20Keppel">Sonia Rosemary Keppel</a> on 16 November 1920 and they had three children: two sons, <a href="Henry%20Cubitt%2C%204th%20Baron%20Ashcombe">Henry</a> and Jeremy (1927–1958); and a daughter, <a href="Rosalind%20Shand">Rosalind</a>. Death duties and the Second World War impacted greatly on the estate: staffing was a problem, and maintenance and general repair costs were unsustainable. The <a href="Home%20Guard%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Home Guard</a> requisitioned a section of the mansion as its headquarters and based a training school there. <a href="Hugh%20Alexander%20Pollock">Hugh Pollock</a>, husband of the author <a href="Enid%20Blyton">Enid Blyton</a>, re-ignited his adulterous affair with <a href="Ida%20Pollock">Ida Crowe</a> after arranging work there for her as a civilian secretary. Roland transformed the buildings that had previously been used as housing for the garden and stable staff into a <a href="Regency%20architecture">Regency</a>-style house. Flooring and doors were stripped from the old mansion to be incorporated in the new house, leaving just the basic structure of Cubitt's original mansion, which had been empty since 1947. Furniture was disposed of in a clearance sale at Dorking in mid-July 1952. Cubitt's mansion was within a designated preservation area, causing the local council to refuse any suggestions that were put forward for the old mansion to be used for commercial purposes. Contractors were brought in to demolish the mansion in 1953; the company may have encountered financial problems, as the basement was not fully destroyed and was left filled with rubble from the higher levels.

Death duties were still outstanding, but in 1959 <a href="HM%20Treasury">the Treasury</a> accepted about of land in lieu of payment, which it passed on to the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a>. At the end of 1963 an additional from Denbies hillside was secured by the Trust via the same route. The Trust also received directly from Lord Ashcombe in 1958 after the mansion was demolished. There had been thirty cottages on the estate in its heyday, but a policy of selling them began with a cottage given to the Trust in 1959. Roland died on 28 October 1962 and the break up and sale of the estate continued under his son Henry, who succeeded him; by this time what remained of the estate amounted to the Regency-style house with land at the eastern end of Ranmore Common, a handful of estate cottages, an adjoining farm – known as Bradley Farm – and some estate outbuildings.

Henry's third marriage was to Elizabeth, the widow of his friend <a href="Mark%20Dent-Brocklehurst">Mark Dent-Brocklehurst</a>, in 1979; she had inherited <a href="Sudeley%20Castle">Sudeley Castle</a>, and the couple made it their family home. Five years later the last of the Denbies estate was offered for sale, bringing to an end more than a century of ownership by the Cubitt family.

When what remained of the estate was marketed in May 1984 the selling agents, <a href="Savills">Savills</a>, described it as being about . This figure included attached to Bradley Farm together with the farmhouse, four cottages and some farm buildings. Denbies House – as the Regency-style house conversion was named – had a lodge, a flat and two cottages, of <a href="landscape%20architecture">parkland</a>, arable land covering and devoted to sporting and amenity woodland. The centrally heated, eight-bedroomed mansion house featured six bathrooms and four reception rooms. There were also tennis courts, stables, garages and a heated swimming pool together with poolhouse. <a href="Biwater">Biwater</a>, a water-treatment company, purchased it during the 1980s. In 1986 the company chairman <a href="Adrian%20White%20%28businessman%29">Adrian White</a> established <a href="Denbies%20Wine%20Estate">Denbies Wine Estate</a>, planting vines on of south-facing land.

Annunciation (Memling)

The Annunciation is an oil-on-oak panel painting attributed to the <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Early Netherlandish</a> painter <a href="Hans%20Memling">Hans Memling</a>. Completed c. 1482, it was partially <a href="Transfer%20of%20panel%20paintings">transferred to canvas</a> in the 1920s and is today held in the <a href="Robert%20Lehman">Robert Lehman</a> collection of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> in New York. The panel shows the <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Virgin</a> in a domestic interior, two attendant angels, the archangel <a href="Gabriel">Gabriel</a> dressed in ecclesiastical robes, and a hovering dove representing the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>. It expands upon the Annunciation wing of <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>'s c. 1455 "<a href="Saint%20Columba%20altarpiece">Saint Columba altarpiece</a>". According to the art historian Maryan Ainsworth, the work is a "startlingly original image, rich in connotations for the viewer or worshiper".

The iconography focuses on the Virgin's purity. Her <a href="Swoon%20of%20the%20Virgin">swoon</a> foreshadows the <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">Crucifixion of Jesus</a>, and the panel emphasises her role as mother, bride and <a href="Queen%20of%20Heaven">Queen of Heaven</a>. The original frame survived until the 19th century and was inscribed with a date believed to be 1482; modern art historians suggested the number's final digit was a nine, which would give a date of 1489. In 1847 <a href="Gustav%20Friedrich%20Waagen">Gustav Friedrich Waagen</a> described it as one of Memling's "finest and most original works". In 1902 it was exhibited in <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a> at the "<a href="Exposition%20des%20primitifs%20flamands%20%C3%A0%20Bruges">Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges</a>", after which it underwent cleaning and restoration. <a href="Philip%20Lehman">Philip Lehman</a> bought it in 1920 from the <a href="Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82">Radziwiłł</a> family who may have had it in their family since the 16th century; <a href="Antoni%20Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82">Antoni Radziwiłł</a> discovered it on a family estate in the early 19th century. At that time it had been pierced through with an arrow and required restoration.

The Annunciation was a popular theme in late medieval European art, Mary acts as <a href="Theotokos">Theotokos</a>, the God-bearer as affirmed in 431 at the <a href="Council%20of%20Ephesus">Council of Ephesus</a>; two decades later the <a href="Council%20of%20Chalcedon">Council of Chalcedon</a> affirmed the doctrine of <a href="Incarnation%20%28Christianity%29">Incarnation</a> – that Christ was of two natures (<a href="Hypostatic%20union">God and Man</a>) – and her perpetual virginity was affirmed at the <a href="Lateran%20Council">Lateran Council</a> of 631. In Byzantine art, Annunciation scenes depict the Virgin enthroned and dressed in royal regalia. In later centuries she was shown in enclosed spaces: the temple, the church, the garden.

In <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20art">Early Netherlandish art</a> the Annunciation is typically set in contemporary domestic interiors, a motif and tradition established by <a href="Robert%20Campin">Robert Campin</a>, and followed by <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a> and <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>. Neither Campin nor van Eyck went so far as to set the scene in a bedchamber, although the motif is found in van der Weyden's c. 1435 Louvre "<a href="Annunciation%20Triptych%20%28Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden%29">Annunciation</a>" and c. 1455 "<a href="Saint%20Columba%20altarpiece">Saint Columba altarpiece</a>" in which the Virgin kneels by the nuptial bed, rendered in red made from costly pigments. Memling's depiction is nearly identical to van der Weyden's "Columba Altarpiece".

The archangel <a href="Gabriel">Gabriel</a> appears before <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Mary</a> to announce that she will bear the <a href="Son%20of%20God">Son of God</a>. He is shown standing in a three-quarter view wearing a small jeweled <a href="diadem">diadem</a> and dressed in <a href="vestment">vestment</a>s. He has a richly embroidered red-and-gold brocade <a href="cope">cope</a>, edged with a pattern of gray seraphim and wheels, over a white <a href="alb">alb</a> and <a href="amice">amice</a>. He holds his staff of office in one hand, and raises the other towards the Virgin. He bends his knees, honoring and acknowledging her as Mother of Christ and <a href="Queen%20of%20Heaven">Queen of Heaven</a>, and his feet are bare and positioned slightly behind hers.

The Virgin is in a frontal view; directly behind her the red-curtained bed acts as a framing device, similar to the traditional canopy-of-honor or <a href="baldachin">baldachin</a>. Unlike Memling's predecessors whose Virgins are garbed in heavily jeweled and costly robes, the plain white shift she wears beneath a blue mantle is minimally jeweled at the hem and at the open neckline. A purple underdress peeks out at her neck and wrists, indicating her royal status. Mary seems neither surprised nor fearful at the announcement; according to Blum the scene is rendered with a great sense of naturalism and successfully depicts "the transformation of Mary from girl to God-bearer."

The Virgin holds an innovative and unusual position. She seems to be either rising or swooning as if having lost her balance, a divergence from her conventional seated or kneeling pose. Blum believes "one may search in vain in other Netherlandish Annunciation panels of the fifteenth century of a Virgin positioned as she is here". Art historian Penny Jolly suggests the painting shows a birthing position, a motif van der Weyden experimented with in the "<a href="Seven%20Sacraments%20Altarpiece">Seven Sacraments Altarpiece</a>", where the Virgin's collapse results in a childbirth-like posture, and with the "<a href="The%20Descent%20from%20the%20Cross%20%28van%20der%20Weyden%29">Descent from the Cross</a>", in which <a href="Mary%20Magdalen">Mary Magdalen</a> bends and crouches – similar to the position Memling's Magdalen assumes in his "". Flanking the Virgin, and holding her, are two attendant angels. The one to the left lifts the Virgin's robe while the other gazes at the viewer, "soliciting our response", according to Ainsworth. Both are small-statured, solemn, and according to Blum, in mood "comparable to that of Gabriel." Other than the presence of the angels, Memling shows a typical upper-merchant-class 15th-century Flemish bedchamber.

The dove of the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> hovers inside a rainbow-hued circle of light directly above the Virgin's head. Its placement and size is unusual for art of the period. It is unlike anything found in van der Weyden, and never repeated in Memling's work, but reminiscent of van Eyck's dove in the "<a href="Ghent%20Altarpiece">Ghent Altarpiece</a>'s" Annunciation panel. Its shape is found in medallions hung above beds at that time, and thus seems in keeping with the domestic interior.

Mary's left hand rests on an open prayer-book, which she has propped open on a "<a href="prie-dieu">prie-dieu</a>", with the letter "D" visible – perhaps for "Deus tecum" ("the Lord be with you"), according to Ainsworth. Blum speculates the passage is from Isaiah 7:14, "Behold a Virgin shall conceive and bear a son." A vase containing white <a href="Lilium%20candidum">lilie</a>s and a single blue <a href="Iris%20%28plant%29">iris</a> is next to it on the floor.

A curtain sack, commonly found on beds of the period, hangs in the central axis between Gabriel and the attendant angel. A sideboard beside the bed contains two types of candles and a flask of water standing in bright light falling from the window to the left. The floor is multi-colored tile-work, similar to van der Weyden's "Columba altarpiece"; Memling truncates the ceiling rafters in the mid-ground, at the end of the bed, with the floor extending into the foreground. Blum describes the effect as acting "like an open stage for the holy figures".

The iconography is not overly labored, and Memling avoids extraneous symbolism. Many elements emphasize Mary's role as the Mother of God; the chamber is furnished with simple everyday objects that indicate her purity. The vase of lilies and the items on the sideboard are objects 15th-century viewers would have associated with her. White lilies were often used to signify her purity, while irises or <a href="Gladiolus">sword lilies</a> were used as metaphors for her suffering. Memling emphasizes symbols associated with her womb and virginity, and "introduces two additional angelic priests, and floods the room with natural light, thereby rearranging the anecdotal to emphasize the doctrinal meaning." <a href="Charles%20Sterling">Charles Sterling</a> describes the work as "one of the finest examples of Memling's ability to take a pictorial convention inherited from his predecessors and infuse it with a heightened sense of emotion and narrative complexity."

From the 9th century Light became associated with Mary and the Incarnation. <a href="Millard%20Meiss">Millard Meiss</a> notes that, from the 12th century a common way to convey the conception was to compare light passing through glass to the passage of the Holy Spirit through the body of the Virgin. <a href="Bernard%20of%20Clairvaux">St. Bernard</a> likened it to sunshine explaining in this passage: "Just as the brilliance of the sun fills and penetrates a glass window without damaging it, and pierces its solid form with imperceptible subtlety, neither hurting when entering nor destroying when emerging; thus the word of God, the splendor of the Father, entered the virgin chamber and then came forth from the closed womb."

Three objects on the bedside cabinet represent the Virgin's purity: the water flask, the candleholder, and the ropewick light. The light passing through the glass of the womb-shaped flask symbolizes her flesh, pierced by divine light, its clear and undisturbed water represents her purity at the moment of conception, a device found also in the earlier paintings as a metaphor of the Virgin's sanctity. The flask shows a reflection of the window's crossbar as a cross, a symbol of the Crucifixion, another small detail in which Memling "lays one translucent symbolic form upon another".

Light represented by candles was then often used to symbolise the Virgin and Christ; both Campin and van Eyck placed hearths or candles in their annunciation scenes. The candleholder without a candle and the ropewick without flame symbolize the world before Christ's <a href="Nativity%20of%20Jesus">Nativity</a> and the presence of his divine light, according to Ainsworth.

The challenge for painters of the Annunciation was how to visually represent the Incarnation, the Word made flesh, or "<a href="Logos%20%28Christianity%29">Logos</a>". They often showed rays of light emanating from Gabriel or a nearby window entering Mary's body to depict the concept of Christ "who inhabited and passed through her body". The light rays might sometimes include an inscription, and were sometimes shown entering her ear, in the belief that it was thus the Word became flesh.

Memling did not depict the light as distinct rays, nor had <a href="Dieric%20Bouts">Dieric Bouts</a>'s Getty "Annunciation". Yet the room is bright, filled with sunlight, a "fenestra incarnationis", which would have been an adequate symbol for the contemporary viewer. By the mid-15th century the Virgin is found depicted in a room or chamber near an open window to permit the passage of light. Memling's room, with its window through which light streams, is a most "decorous sign of Mary's chastity", according to Blum. There are no word scrolls or banderoles to indicate the Virgin's acceptance, yet her consent is obvious through her pose, which seems, according to Sterling, both submissive and active.

The Virgin birth is indicated by the red bed and red womb-shaped curtain-sack. During the early-15th century hanging beds or curtain-sacks became symbols of the Incarnation, and "served to affirm [Christ's] humanity". Blum notes that at a time "when artists did not hesitate to depict the breast of the Virgin, Memling did not shun her womb". Christ's humanity was a source of fascination, and it was only in Netherlandish art that a solution was found for visualizing his embryonic state with curtain-sacks draped to suggest the shape of a womb.

Mary's body becomes the tabernacle holding the <a href="Sacramental%20bread">Host</a> made flesh. She becomes an object of devotion, a "monstrance containing the Host". Her full belly and the presence of the dove indicate the moment of Incarnation has occurred. Viewers would have been reminded of the <a href="Crucifixion">Crucifixion</a> and <a href="Lamentation%20of%20Christ">Lamentation</a> with the <a href="Swoon%20of%20the%20Virgin">swoon</a>, "thus anticipating Christ's sacrifice for the salvation of mankind at the moment of his conception." According to theologians, Mary stood with dignity at the <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">Crucifixion of Jesus</a>, but in 15th-century art she is depicted swooning, according to Jolly, "in agony at the sight of her dying son … assuming the pose of a mother in the throes of the pain of childbirth". At the cross she felt the pain of his death; pain which at his birth she had not experienced.

The painting's domestic setting belies its liturgical meaning. The dove is a reminder of the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a> and Mass. <a href="Lotte%20Brand%20Philip">Lotte Brand Philip</a> observes how throughout the 15th century "eucharistic vessels made in the form of doves and suspended over altars … were lowered at the moment of transubstantiation"; here it suggests that in the same way the Holy Spirit gives life to the bread and wine, it gave life to the Virgin's womb. She carries the <a href="Real%20presence%20of%20Christ%20in%20the%20Eucharist">Body and Blood of Christ</a>, and is attended by three priestly angels. Mary's function is to bear "the Savior of the World"; the angels' role is to "support, present and protect her sacred being". With the birth of Christ her "miraculous womb passed its final test" to become an object of veneration.

Memling presents the Virgin as the Bride of Christ about to assume her role as Queen of Heaven, with attendant angels indicating her royal status. These kind of angels are usually shown hovering above the Virgin, holding her crown, and some German painters showed them hovering close in Annunciation scenes, but angels rarely approach or touch the Virgin. Only a single previous version of such attendant angels has been found: in the <a href="Boucicaut%20Master">Boucicaut Master</a>'s early 15th-century illuminated manuscript version of the "Visitation", the pregnant Virgin's long mantle is held by attendant angels, about which Blum notes that "her queenly appearance surely commemorates the moment when Mary is first addressed as Theotokos, the Mother of the Lord." Memling often depicted pairs of angels dressed in vestments attending the Virgin, but these two, dressed in simple amices and albs, were never repeated in his art. Their dual function is to "present the eucharistic offering and proclaim the Virgin bride and queen".

The "Annunciation" draws heavily on van der Weyden's 1430s Louvre "Annunciation", his c. 1455 "Saint Columba altarpiece", and the "Clugny Annunciation" (c. 1465–75), which is attributed to either van der Weyden or Memling. Memling almost certainly was apprenticed to van der Weyden in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> until setting up his own workshop in <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a> sometime after 1465. Memling's "Annunciation" is more innovative, with motifs such as the attendant angels that were absent in the earlier paintings. According to <a href="Till-Holger%20Borchert">Till-Holger Borchert</a>, not only was Memling familiar with van der Weyden's motifs and compositions, but he might have assisted with the underdrawing in van der Weyden's workshop. The shutters on the right are copied from the Louvre panel, the knotted curtain appears in the "Columba" triptych's "Annunciation".

A sense of movement is conveyed throughout. The trailing edges of Gabriel's garment fall outside the pictorial space, indicating his arrival. The Virgin's "serpentine" pose, with attendant angels supporting her, adds to the sense of flow. Memling's use of color achieves a startling effect. The traditional rays of light are replaced with light color indicators; the white clothes rendered in "icy" blue, the angel to the right in yellow patches seems "bleached by light", the left-hand angel appears to be steeped in shadow, dressed in clothes of lavender and bearing deep green wings. The effect is iridescent, according to Blum, who writes, "this shimmering surface gives [the figures] an unearthly quality, separating them from the more believable world of the bedchamber." The effect deviates from the pure naturalism and realism which typifies Early Netherlandish art, causing a "startling" juxtaposition, an effect that is "unsteadying" and contradictory.

Scholars have not established if the panel was meant to be a single devotional work, or part of a larger, and now broken up, <a href="polyptych">polyptych</a>. According to Ainsworth, its size and "the sacramental nature of its subject would have been appropriate for a family chapel in a church or monastery for the chapel of a guild corporation." An intact, inscribed frame is unusual for a wing panel, indicating that it was probably intended as a single piece, but scholars are unsure because the slight left-to-right axis of the tiles tend to suggest it could have been the left-hand wing of a larger piece. There is no information about the panel's reverse, which has not survived.

Technical analysis shows extensive underdrawing, typical for Memling. They were completed in a <a href="Charcoal%20%28art%29">dry medium</a> except for the dove and the flask and candles on the sideboard. Revisions during the final painting included the enlargement of the Virgin's sleeves and the repositioning of Gabriel's staff. Incisions were made to indicate the floor tiles and the dove's position.

The only person to question <a href="Gustav%20Friedrich%20Waagen">Gustav Friedrich Waagen</a>'s 1847 attribution to Memling is <a href="William%20Henry%20James%20Weale">W. H. J. Weale</a>, who in 1903 declared Memling "would never have dreamt of introducing into the representation of this mystery these two sentimental and affected angels."

The painting's known provenance begins in the 1830s when it was in the possession of the <a href="Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82">Radziwiłł</a> family. According to art historian <a href="Sulpiz%20Boisser%C3%A9e">Sulpiz Boisserée</a>, who saw the painting in 1832, <a href="Antoni%20Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82">Antoni Radziwiłł</a> found the painting in an estate his father owned. Waagen speculated that may have belonged to <a href="Miko%C5%82aj%20Krzysztof%20%26quot%3Bthe%20Orphan%26quot%3B%20Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82">Mikolai Radziwill</a> (1549–1616) who might have inherited it from his brother <a href="Jerzy%20Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82%20%281556%E2%80%931600%29">Jerzy Radziwill</a>, (1556–1600), who was a cardinal. The family kept it until 1920 when Princess Radziwill sold it to the <a href="Duveen%20Brothers">Duveen Brothers</a> in Paris. <a href="Philip%20Lehman">Philip Lehman</a> bought it in October 1920; it is now held in the <a href="Robert%20Lehman">Robert Lehman</a> collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York.

Generally the condition is good. Memling painted the work on two panels of about 28 cm each. The dated and inscribed frame, probably the original, was discarded in 1830. There have been three documented restorations. The painting had been pierced by an arrow when Anton Radziwill found it; he had it restored and the damage repaired. At that time the Virgin's mantle and the flesh tones sustained heavy overpainting. The original frame was discarded, but its inscription was inserted into the new frame. A description of the original frame suggests it carried a coat-of-arms, perhaps belonging to Jerzy Radziwill. The second restoration was after its <a href="Exposition%20des%20primitifs%20flamands%20%C3%A0%20Bruges">exhibition in Bruges</a> in 1902; and the third when Lehman had it restored and <a href="Transfer%20of%20panel%20paintings">transferred to canvas</a> sometime after 1928. The painting survived the transfer without significant damage. A late-19th century photograph shows wood on all four sides of the painted surface, which suggests the edges may have been extended during the transfer. Areas that suffered paint loss and overpainting are Gabriel's cope and the vase holding the flowers.

When Boisserée saw the painting he recorded the inscription's date as 1480. The last digit of the inscription was faded and difficult to read and had become illegible by 1899. Waagen suggested the date could have been 1482, and art historian Dirk de Vos suggested 1489.
Memling's style does not lend itself well to assigning dates, making a determination difficult. According to Stirling, an earlier date is easily accepted, especially because of stylistic similarities to Memling's 1479 "<a href="St%20John%20Altarpiece%20%28Memling%29">St John Altarpiece</a>", whereas Ainsworth leans toward the later date as more in keeping with the mature style of the late 1480s.

Teresa Sampsonia

Teresa Sampsonia (born Sampsonia; after marriage Lady Teresa Sampsonia Shirley, 1589–1668) was a noblewoman of the <a href="Safavid%20dynasty">Safavid Empire</a> of <a href="Iran">Iran</a>. She was the wife of <a href="Elizabethan">Elizabethan</a> English adventurer <a href="Robert%20Shirley">Robert Shirley</a>, whom she accompanied on his travels <a href="Persian%20embassy%20to%20Europe%20%281609%E2%80%9315%29">and embassies</a> across Europe in the name of the Safavid King ("<a href="Shah">Shah</a>") <a href="Abbas%20the%20Great">Abbas the Great</a> (1588–1629).

Teresa was received by many of the <a href="Monarchies%20in%20Europe">royal houses of Europe</a>, such as English crown prince <a href="Henry%20Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Henry Frederick</a> and <a href="Anne%20of%20Denmark">Queen Anne</a> (her child's <a href="godparent">godparent</a>s) and contemporary writers and artists such as <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Herbert%2C%201st%20Baronet">Thomas Herbert</a> and <a href="Anthony%20van%20Dyck">Anthony van Dyck</a>. Herbert considered Robert Shirley "the greatest Traveller of his time", but admired the "undaunted Lady Teresa" even more. Following the death of her husband from <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a> in 1628, and due to impediments from <a href="grandee">grandee</a>s at the court, and the authorities, during the reign of Abbas's successor and grandson <a href="Safi%20of%20Persia">Safi</a> (1629–1642), Teresa decided to leave Iran. She lived in a convent in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> for the rest of her life, devoting her time to charity and religion. As a pious Christian, and because of her love for her husband, Teresa had Shirley's remains transported to Rome from <a href="Isfahan">Isfahan</a> and reburied; on the headstone of their mutual grave she mentions their travels and refers to her noble <a href="Circassians">Circassian</a> origins.

Thanks to her exploits, Teresa has been described as someone who subverted <a href="Patriarchy">patriarchal</a> gender roles common to the Muslim and Christian cultures of her time. Due to their hybrid identities and adventures, Teresa and her husband became the subject of several contemporary literary and visual works. Nevertheless, the story of Teresa as an important woman of the 17th century has been largely overshadowed and obscured by the tale of her husband Robert and his brothers.

The travels of Teresa and Robert Shirley were recorded in many contemporaneous English, Italian, <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> and Spanish sources, including eyewitness accounts. According to Penelope Tuson, the main sources that deal with Teresa's life are the "predictably semi-<a href="Hagiography">hagiographic</a>" accounts stored in the archives of the <a href="Vatican%20City">Vatican</a> and the <a href="Carmelites">Carmelite</a> order. These Vatican and Carmelite sources were compiled, edited and published by Herbert Chick in 1939 in his "Chronicle of the Carmelites in Persia". Though the "Chronicle of the Carmelites in Persia" evidently portrays a positive image of Teresa, Tuson notes that the accounts are "patchy" and "contradictory" on some occasions. Furthermore, the narrative is considered to be from the viewpoint of European Catholicism. Other sources that help create a modern scholarly account of Teresa include the only document she is known to have written in English (a petition to King <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I of England</a> 1603–1625), paintings, and to a lesser extent, official letters signed by King ("<a href="Shah">Shah</a>") <a href="Abbas%20the%20Great">Abbas the Great</a> (1588–1629).

Teresa was born in 1589 into a noble <a href="Orthodox%20Christianity">Orthodox Christian</a> <a href="Circassians">Circassian</a> family in the <a href="Safavid%20dynasty">Safavid Empire</a>, ruled at the time by King Abbas the Great. She was named Sampsonia at birth. The daughter of Ismail Khan, a brother-in-law of the King, she grew up in <a href="Isfahan">Isfahan</a> in the <a href="Iran">Iran</a>ian royal court as a reportedly beautiful, accomplished horsewoman who enjoyed <a href="embroidery">embroidery</a> and <a href="painting">painting</a>.

Robert Shirley was an English adventurer who was sent to the Safavids, after a <a href="Persian%20embassy%20to%20Europe%20%281599%E2%80%931602%29">Persian embassy</a> was sent to Europe, to forge an alliance against the neighbouring <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, rivals of the Safavids. During his attendance at court, Teresa met him and fell in love. On 2 February 1608, with the approval of her aunt and Abbas, Teresa married <a href="Robert%20Shirley">Robert Shirley</a> in Iran. At about the time of their wedding, she was baptised as a <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholic</a> by the Carmelites in Isfahan with the name Teresa. Her baptismal name derives from the founder of the <a href="Discalced%20Carmelites">Discalced Carmelites</a>, <a href="Teresa%20of%20%C3%81vila">Teresa of Ávila</a>.

Teresa accompanied Robert on his <a href="diplomatic%20mission">diplomatic mission</a>s for King Abbas to <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a> and other royal houses in Europe. When they set off on their <a href="Persian%20embassy%20to%20Europe%20%281609%E2%80%9315%29">first embassy trip</a>, Robert was captured by his enemies. Teresa reportedly managed to save him and put to flight the attackers; for this, the Carmelite records praised her as "a true <a href="Amazons">Amazon</a>". Teresa and Shirley visited the Grand Duke of <a href="Muscovy">Muscovy</a>, Pope <a href="Paul%20V">Paul V</a> in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> and the King of <a href="Poland">Poland</a>. In Poland, Teresa lived in a <a href="convent">convent</a> in <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a> for some time while her husband visited <a href="Prague">Prague</a>, where Emperor <a href="Rudolph%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Rudolph II</a> (1576–1612) bestowed on him the title of <a href="Count%20palatine">Count Palatine</a>. He arrived in Rome on 27 September 1609 and met Ali Qoli Beg, Abbas I's ambassador, with whom he had an audience with the Pope. Shirley then left for <a href="Duchy%20of%20Savoy">Savoy</a>, <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, <a href="Milan">Milan</a>, <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20France">France</a>, <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> and <a href="Habsburg%20Spain">Spain</a> (<a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>). Teresa rejoined him in <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> via <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>. They then went to <a href="Valladolid">Valladolid</a> and Madrid where Teresa came to know the Carmelite nuns, particularly Mother Beatrix de Jesus (the niece of Saint Teresa) from whom she received a relic of Teresa).

Teresa and Shirley left for <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Holland</a> and subsequently sailed from <a href="Bayonne">Bayonne</a> to England, where they arrived around the beginning of August 1611. Their only child, a son named Henry, in all likelihood the first English-born child of Iranian descent according to <a href="Sheila%20R.%20Canby">Sheila R. Canby</a>, was born in November 1611 at the Shirley home in <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a>. His godparents were crown Prince <a href="Henry%20Frederick%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Henry Frederick</a>, for whom he was named, and <a href="Anne%20of%20Denmark">Queen Anne</a>. Teresa and Robert remained in England a little over a year. Before departing from <a href="Gravesend">Gravesend</a> to Safavid Iran in 1612–1613, they decided to turn young Henry over to Robert's family in Sussex. He is believed to have survived until at least 1622, but to have died at a young age. Teresa and Shirley's two-and-a-half-year return voyage to Iran proved to be extremely difficult. On one occasion, they were almost killed at sea. On another, during their short stop in <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal India</a> to meet Emperor <a href="Jahangir">Jahangir</a> (1605–1627), hostile Portuguese tried to assassinate the couple. The couple remained in Iran for a few months, before disembarking on their second embassy.

On their last mission, Teresa and Robert arrived in Lisbon through <a href="Goa">Goa</a> on 27 September 1617. They headed towards Madrid, where they stayed until March 1622, then went to Florence and Rome. During this last brief visit to Rome between 22 July and 29 August 1622, <a href="Anthony%20van%20Dyck">Anthony van Dyck</a> (then 23 years old) painted their portraits. The couple then went to <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> in Poland, and perhaps Moscow afterwards, before visiting England in 1623 for the last time. They sailed for the Safavid Empire in 1627 on an <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a> ship with <a href="Dodmore%20Cotton">Dodmore Cotton</a>, an envoy from the King of England to Persia and other courts. Teresa and Robert returned to Isfahan through <a href="Surat">Surat</a> and <a href="Bandar%20Abbas">Bandar Abbas</a>. The couple then moved to <a href="Qazvin">Qazvin</a> (the former capital of Safavid Iran) were the king rewarded them with valuable gifts. Shirley and Cotton became seriously ill with fever (probably <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>), shortly after their arrival.

Shirley and Teresa were troubled by the jealousy of several nobles and grandees at court, who spread a rumour that Teresa was a <a href="Islam">Muslim</a> before she became a Christian. They disgraced her to the king, and it was reportedly published in the court that he intended to execute her by burning. Fifteen days after hearing the report, Robert died of fever on 13 July 1628 in Qazvin. According to his wishes, he was buried in the Barefoot Carmelite church in Isfahan. The King summoned Teresa, asking her why the grandees were so opposed to her. She remained silent to protect them; according to contemporaneous accounts, the King advised her not to be afraid, "because it would be harder for him to put one woman to death than a hundred men". Some of his corrupt officials plundered her wealth. Teresa reportedly became seriously ill, and was moved to Isfahan to receive the <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a>s from the priests; she recovered and decided to move to a Christian land.

In the Safavid Empire women were prohibited from travelling abroad without permission. So the Carmelites in Isfahan asked the governor of <a href="Shiraz">Shiraz</a>, <a href="Imam-Quli%20Khan">Emamqoli Khan</a>, son of the celebrated <a href="Allahverdi%20Khan">Allahverdi Khan</a> (one of Abbas's closest associates), for consent on Teresa's behalf. A <a href="favourite">favourite</a> of Emamqoli Khan wanted to marry Teresa, and reminded the governor of the report that she had been a Muslim before she was a Christian. She was ordered to appear before a <a href="mullah">mullah</a> (a religious judge) in a mosque, who would question her about her past and her religion. This was unacceptable to the Carmelites, who asked the governor to have Teresa questioned in the church of the Carmelite fathers. The mullah rejected this, but an agreement was reached that they would meet in the home of a steward of the governor of Shiraz, who was a friend of the Carmelite Fathers. She was questioned for an hour before she was allowed to return home. 

Safavid Iran was disturbed by the death of King Abbas a few months after Shirley's death. Abbas's grandson, <a href="Safi%20of%20Persia">Safi</a> (1629–1642), succeeded him; he was less consistent than his grandfather in his religious tolerance. The favourite of Emamqoli Khan, who still wanted to marry Teresa, sent his servants to the Carmelites in Isfahan to capture her. The priests denied knowing her whereabouts, and advised her to take refuge in the Church of Saint Augustine in <a href="New%20Julfa">New Julfa</a> (the Armenian quarter in Isfahan). The priests were brought to the favourite's house and reportedly threatened with torture before they were released.

The mullah asked Emamqoli Khan for permission to question Teresa again. Since he favoured the Carmelite Fathers, and did not want to insult the mullah, he said that the matter concerned Isfahan prefect ("<a href="darugha">darugha</a>") <a href="Rostom%20of%20Kartli">Khosrow Mirza</a>. The prefect, like the governor of Shiraz, was also a <a href="Georgians">Georgian</a>. He had Teresa arrested and brought before him; a judge questioned her about her religion. She professed her Christianity, reportedly saying that she would die "a thousand times" for it. 
The judge accused her of lying and threatened to burn her alive if she did not convert to Islam. When Teresa refused, the judge threatened to have her thrown from a tower; she reportedly said that would suit her better, because she would die (and go to heaven) more quickly. According to the Carmelites, the judge was shamed by her reminder of Shirley's service. He ended the questioning and reported to the prefect of Isfahan who allowed Teresa to return to her house and had the mullah dismissed. The Carmelite Fathers received the necessary permission from the governor of Shiraz in September 1629. Teresa's departure was documented in a letter from Father Dimas in the Carmelite archives in Rome:

Three years after returning from her last trip, Teresa left her country of birth forever. She lived in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> for three years, receiving a certificate from the <a href="commissary">commissary</a> general of the <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominicans in the East</a> on 21 June 1634 reportedly attesting to her pious conduct. Around that time, she decided to retire to a convent in Rome, which was attached to the Carmelite <a href="Santa%20Maria%20della%20Scala">Santa Maria della Scala</a> church.

On 27 December 1634 she arrived in Rome and was received kindly by Pope <a href="Urban%20VIII">Urban VIII</a>, who entrusted her to the Carmelites. Teresa bought a house next to the church. In 1658 she had Robert's remains transported from Isfahan to Rome, where he was reburied in the Santa Maria della Scala. In the Carmelite convent, she devoted herself to charity and religion until her death at age 79 in 1688. Teresa was buried in the church, where she had lived for forty years, in the same grave where she had buried her husband Robert ten years earlier.

She had the <a href="headstone">headstone</a> inscribed: "Deo Optimo Maximo Roberto Sherleyo Anglo Nobilissimo Comiti Cesareo Equiti Aurato Rodulfi II Imperatori Legato Ad Scia Abbam Regem Persarum et Eiusdeum Regis Secundo Ad Romanos Pontifices Imperatores Reges Hispaniae Angliae Poloniae Moscoviae Mogorri Aliosque Europae Principes Inclito Oratori. Theresia Sampsonia Amazonites Samphuffi Circassiae Principes Filia Viro Amatissimo et Sibi Posuit Illius Ossibus Suisque Laribus In Urbem E Perside Pietatis Ergo Translatis Annos Nata LXXIX MDCLXVIII" 

According to <a href="Bernadette%20Andrea">Bernadette Andrea</a> (2017), the text demonstrates that Teresa subverted the <a href="Patriarchy">patriarchal</a> gender roles common to the Muslim and Christian cultures of her time.

The adventures of Teresa and her husband, and what Andrea calls their "hybrid identities", inspired a variety of literary and visual works. According to <a href="Manoutchehr%20Eskandari-Qajar">Manoutchehr Eskandari-Qajar</a>, Shirley and his "exotic wife with an even more exotic life story" sparked a great deal of curiosity and interest among their contemporaries in the West. During her journeys between Persia and Europe, Teresa was remarked upon by contemporary writers, artists and <a href="Monarchies%20in%20Europe">European royal houses</a>. Travel writer <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Herbert%2C%201st%20Baronet">Thomas Herbert</a> described Shirley as "the greatest Traveller of his time", but he admired the "undaunted Lady Teresa" even more, as one whose "faith was ever Christian". Teresa and her husband were invariably noted for their exotic garb. In every high-level meeting, Shirley appeared in his high-status Persian attire of silk and velvet. He was <a href="Persianized">Persianized</a> to such a degree that contemporary playwright and pamphleteer <a href="Thomas%20Middleton">Thomas Middleton</a> referred to him as the "famous English "Persian"".

Works inspired by the couple include two portraits by van Dyck, pamphlets in many languages, and <a href="Jacobean%20era">Jacobean</a> stage plays including "<a href="The%20Travels%20of%20the%20Three%20English%20Brothers">The Travels of the Three English Brothers</a>". <a href="Lady%20Mary%20Wroth">Lady Mary Wroth</a>'s "<a href="The%20Countess%20of%20Montgomery%27s%20Urania">Urania</a>" was partly influenced by Teresia Sampsonia's travels to England with her husband. Tuson argues that Teresa's story has been overshadowed by "the partly selfcreated myth of the Shirley's", who became the main subject of many of the contemporary "biographies as well as subsequent historical studies". Carmen Nocentelli notes that the "figure of Teresa has been generally obscured by those of her male relatives". According to Nocentelli:

Nocentelli does add that the belittling of Teresa as a historic figure of importance was limited to England. Outside England, "Teresa Sampsonia Sherley was a figure of note in and of her own right". Contemporaneous Italian traveller <a href="Pietro%20della%20Valle">Pietro della Valle</a> referred to Teresa as an "Ambassadress of the King of Persia", which Nocentelli interprets as putting Teresa on an "equal footing with her husband". In 2009, in London, there were two simultaneous exhibitions which featured Teresa and her husband: "Shah 'Abbas: The Remaking of Iran" (<a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, February to June 2009) and "Van Dyck and Britain" (<a href="Tate%20Britain">Tate Britain</a>, February to May 2009).

He was an <a href="List%20of%20NBL%20Canada%20All-Stars">NBL Canada All-Star</a> in 2014, and subsequently won the league <a href="List%20of%20NBL%20Canada%20champions">championship</a> in 2016.

A native of <a href="Jamaica%2C%20Queens">Jamaica, Queens</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, Clinkscales rose to prominence as a basketball player at a young age, drawing attention from coaches around the country. After his freshman year at <a href="Springfield%20Gardens%20High%20School">Springfield Gardens High School</a>, he transferred to Shores Christian Academy in <a href="Ocala%2C%20Florida">Ocala, Florida</a>, where his team won the National Association of Christian Athletes title. Consequently, Clinkscales received interest from several major <a href="college%20basketball">college basketball</a> programs as a three-star recruit. He played with the <a href="DePaul%20Blue%20Demons%20men%27s%20basketball">DePaul Blue Demons</a> from 2004 to 2008 and joined the BayHawks soon after. For his entire college career, Clinkscales had a limited impact as a scorer despite his passing ability, becoming the fifth freshman at DePaul to pass for 100 <a href="assist%20%28basketball%29">assists</a>. While most of his statistics stagnated over the years, he led <a href="NCAA%20Division%20I">NCAA Division I</a> in assist-to-<a href="turnover%20%28basketball%29">turnover</a> ratio as a senior. After previously announcing a break from the Hurricanes, Clinkscales affirmed in October 2016 that he would represent the team in the 2016–2017 season.

Clinkscales was brought up in <a href="Jamaica%2C%20Queens">Jamaica</a> in <a href="Queens">Queens</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> with three siblings. He was raised by his mother and a family friend, Clarence Washington, rather than his biological father. Washington introduced a young Clinkscales to the game of basketball, with his sister, Kima, teaching him how to <a href="Dribbling%23Basketball">dribble</a>. Washington admired Clinkscales' interest in the game, commenting, "He was born with a God-given talent... When it comes to basketball, he has an IQ that's just crazy."

Shortly before entering fifth grade, in the summer of 1996, Clinkscales—standing 4 ft 8 in (1.42 m)—was noticed in an ABCD basketball camp in <a href="Teaneck%2C%20New%20Jersey">Teaneck, New Jersey</a>. The camp was designed for college-level basketball hopefuls, but Clinkscales dribbled on the court in between games and drew attention from coaches. His performance at the camp led to his national recognition, after he was featured by "<a href="Slam%20%28magazine%29">Slam</a>", was labeled a "<a href="child%20prodigy">prodigy</a>" by the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>", and appeared on the TV programs "<a href="The%20Oprah%20Winfrey%20Show">The Oprah Winfrey Show</a>" and "<a href="The%20Rosie%20O%27Donnell%20Show">The Rosie O'Donnell Show</a>". Thereafter, Clinkscales received <a href="college%20recruiting">college recruitment</a> letters from the <a href="Kansas%20Jayhawks%20men%27s%20basketball">Kansas Jayhawks</a> and <a href="USC%20Trojans%20men%27s%20basketball">USC Trojans</a>.

Despite achieving distinction at a young age, Clinkscales soon fell out of the public view. He spent one year in <a href="Springfield%20Gardens%20High%20School">Springfield Gardens High School</a> in Queens and did not play basketball for the team due to poor grades. When considering his failure to develop his potential at an early stage, he reflected: "All [of the expectations] would have come true if I could have stayed in New York and played high school basketball." In the following year, he transferred to Shores Christian Academy in <a href="Ocala%2C%20Florida">Ocala, Florida</a>. The decision to switch schools was made because he wanted to improve his academic performance, and one of his friends knew the new school's basketball coach, Allan Adams. At Ocala, Clinkscales lived with Stephen and Nancy Davidson, who both worked at the academy. Stephen was a pastor and the administrator of the school, and Nancy was an office staff member.

Clinkscales expressed regrets over leaving Queens after <a href="Norm%20Roberts">Norm Roberts</a>, who had shown an interest in him, was hired by <a href="St.%20John%27s%20Red%20Storm%20men%27s%20basketball">St. John's</a>. While in Ocala, he tried to become better at basketball by doing 200 <a href="push-up">push-up</a>s every night. He also visited his hometown during school vacations. In his time living in Florida, Clinkscales had a <a href="growth%20spurt">growth spurt</a> and stood nearly at 6 ft (1.83 m), boosting his performance on the court. Commenting on Clinkscales' decision to move to Florida, Clarence Washington said, "Going down there was the best thing that ever happened to him."

At Shores Christian Academy, Clinkscales became a top player on the basketball team, averaging 21 <a href="point%20%28basketball%29">points</a> and 12 assists during his senior year. On January 3, 2004, he recorded 24 points and eight assists, including a <a href="layup">layup</a> with four seconds left in regulation, to defeat <a href="Trinity%20Catholic%20High%20School%20%28Florida%29">Trinity Catholic</a> by one point. In another contest that month, Clinkscales notched 31 points and 11 assists in a triple-overtime loss to <a href="Gainesville%20High%20School%20%28Florida%29">Gainesville High School</a>, the top-ranked team at the Diamondback Challenge tournament. In the Florida Christian Athletic League's south quarterfinals, he posted 40 points and 14 assists to beat Ocala Word of Faith by a 100–32 margin. In the district title contest, he put up 26 points, 15 assists, six <a href="rebound%20%28basketball%29">rebounds</a>, and three <a href="steal%20%28basketball%29">steals</a>. Clinkscales' team won the National Association of Christian Athletes championship behind a 36-win season, and he was named the "Ocala Star-Banner" boys' basketball player of the year. Despite his success at Ocala, the low competition level prevented him from drawing national attention. However, he was in the spotlight playing for the Atlanta Celtics, an <a href="Amateur%20Athletic%20Union">Amateur Athletic Union</a> (AAU) program made up of players such as <a href="Dwight%20Howard">Dwight Howard</a>, <a href="Josh%20Smith">Josh Smith</a>, and <a href="Randolph%20Morris">Randolph Morris</a>. He joined the team because they required a reliable point guard. The Celtics won the Adidas Big Time Tournament, sparking coaches' interest in him once again. Basketball news website The Hoop Scoop named Clinkscales the 47th-best high school player in his class as he entered college. He was rated a three-star recruit by both <a href="Rivals.com">Rivals.com</a> and <a href="247Sports.com">247Sports.com</a>.

<a href="Louisville%20Cardinals%20men%27s%20basketball">Louisville</a>, <a href="Florida%20Gators%20men%27s%20basketball">Florida</a>, and <a href="Maryland%20Terrapins%20men%27s%20basketball">Maryland</a> were among the several schools that initially showed interest in Clinkscales as he entered college. <a href="Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20men%27s%20basketball">Florida State</a> was his preferred choice, and he made multiple unofficial visits to the school. However, the team would not offer him an <a href="athletic%20scholarship">athletic scholarship</a> because of his low test scores. Once he improved his scores, Clinkscales caught the attention of more schools, including <a href="Baylor%20Bears%20basketball">Baylor</a> and <a href="St.%20John%27s%20Red%20Storm%20men%27s%20basketball">St. John's</a>. On May 7, 2004, he announced his decision to play for the DePaul Blue Demons, noting that it would soon be a part of the <a href="Big%20East%20Conference">Big East Conference</a>, meaning that he could play at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a>. The school's urban environment also prompted him to make the decision. Blue Demons head coach <a href="Dave%20Leitao">Dave Leitao</a> praised the new signee, saying, "Cliff is a true point guard who brings speed, athleticism, and quickness that we will need in our program." Clinkscales entered college with hopes of returning to prominence in the game.

On November 20, 2004, Clinkscales made his collegiate debut with the Blue Demons by scoring one point and recording two assists in 14 minutes against . He soon became popular among DePaul basketball fans, and was nicknamed "The Colonel." On December 6, Clinkscales helped DePaul defeat with seven points and a team-high 12 assists. The freshman commented, "The best thing I can do is pass. I really don't have to look at them (my team members). I just tell them to be ready." On December 18 he put up 13 assists, along with seven points and three steals, to help beat . It was Clinkscales' first career start, as he substituted for <a href="Drake%20Diener">Drake Diener</a>. In a win over on January 2, 2005, he replaced <a href="Sammy%20Mej%C3%ADa">Sammy Mejía</a> and scored nine points for his best scoring performance of the season. Clinkscales also recorded six assists and a season-high four rebounds in the contest. He closed the season averaging 2.5 points, 3.4 assists, and 0.9 rebounds in 15 minutes per game. Clinkscales finished the season with an assist-to-turnover ratio of 2.31, the third-best in <a href="Conference%20USA">Conference USA</a> and the best on his team. He also became the fifth DePaul freshman ever to break the 100-assist barrier.

For Clinkscales' sophomore season, DePaul moved from Conference USA to the Big East Conference and also hired <a href="Jerry%20Wainwright">Jerry Wainwright</a> as head coach. The team also welcomed incoming freshman, and the reigning <a href="Mr.%20Basketball%20of%20Michigan">Mr. Basketball of Michigan</a>, <a href="Wilson%20Chandler">Wilson Chandler</a>. Clinkscales debuted in a 60–75 loss to <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Bradley%20Braves%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Bradley</a> on November 19, 2005. He scored three points and passed for a team-high six assists but also had five turnovers. Clinkscales scored a then-career-best 11 points, as well as four assists and no turnovers, on December 31 vs. . He made two three-pointers and five free-throws in the game, both of which would be season highs. Clinkscales came off the bench to help the team extend their two-point lead with under eight minutes left in regulation to 12 points at the end of the game. On January 21, 2006, Clinkscales posted a season-best six assists in a one-point loss to . Despite spending 38 minutes on the court, he only attempted four <a href="field%20goal%20%28basketball%29">field goals</a>. For the season, he averaged 3.2 points, 2.5 assists, and 1.1 rebounds in 19.5 minutes per game.

As a junior, Clinkscales regressed statistically. He played four minutes in DePaul's season-opening loss to Bradley on November 11, 2006 but recorded no statistics. On November 17, in a win against , Clinkscales finished with a season-high three steals. He recorded his first point on November 20, posting two points and three assists in 13 minutes off the bench vs. <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Kentucky%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Kentucky</a> at the <a href="Maui%20Invitational%20Tournament">Maui Invitational Tournament</a>. In the following round of the event, in a victory over <a href="Chaminade%20Silverswords">Chaminade</a>, he had two steals and a season-best 13 assists. Clinkscales came off the bench against at the <a href="Ryan%20Center">Ryan Center</a> to score six points, the most in the season, on December 16. He replicated the scoring feat on December 29 vs. , along with nine assists. His team ended up defeating their opponents by 30 points, also pushed by a 40-point performance by Sammy Mejía. Following an early loss at the <a href="2007%20National%20Invitation%20Tournament">2007 National Invitation Tournament</a> (NIT), he capped the season playing 12 minutes per game and averaging 1.4 points, 2.3 assists, and 1.2 rebounds per contest.

Heading into the following season, the Blue Demons lacked both leadership and talent at the point guard position. Clinkscales hoped to assume the role as a leader, saying, "I think that's my job. I'm going to do that, regardless 40 minutes or two minutes. I'm going to try to help the guys out, from the bench or on the court." His development impressed Jerry Wainwright, who became more comfortable with giving him more playing time. Clinkscales began his final season at DePaul with a 12-point loss to on November 9, 2007. After playing 21 minutes off the bench, he had five points, two assists, two turnovers, and a season-high three steals. Heading into late December, in the midst of multiple injuries to his teammates, Clinkscales began receiving increased playing time and frequently appeared in the Blue Demons' starting lineup. On January 3, 2008, while playing a career-high 39 minutes against <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Villanova%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Villanova</a>, he scored a season-best 12 points and added eight assists with two turnovers. Clinkscales was effective once again in his team's January 16 rematch with Villanova, as he finished with 11 assists – the most he would record as a senior. Despite his passing efforts, the team was unable to beat the Wildcats, and lost 69–76. Against on February 23, Clinkscales led his team with eight assists and two steals. He faced <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Notre Dame</a> on March 2, having eight assists, four rebounds, and one turnover.
As his senior season ended, he was averaging 3.0 points, 1.2 rebounds, and 4.1 assists in 25.9 minutes per game. He led NCAA Division I with an assist-to-turnover ratio of 3.62.

On November 7, 2008, Clinkscales was selected as the seventh pick of the ninth round in the <a href="2008%20NBA%20Development%20League%20Draft">2008 NBA Development League Draft</a> by the <a href="Erie%20BayHawks%20%282008%E2%80%932017%29">Erie BayHawks</a>. Later, he officially made his professional debut with the BayHawks on November 28, adding 12 points, four rebounds, and three assists in a loss to the <a href="Fort%20Wayne%20Mad%20Ants">Fort Wayne Mad Ants</a>. On December 11, Clinkscales recorded his first <a href="Double%20%28basketball%29%23Double-double">double-double</a> with ten points and a team-high 11 assists, helping his team defeat the <a href="Iowa%20Energy">Iowa Energy</a>. In a loss to the <a href="Sioux%20Falls%20Skyforce">Sioux Falls Skyforce</a> later in the season, he posted a career-high 13 assists. Throughout his initial stint with the BayHawks, Clinkscales emerged as a reliable passer and played in nine games. After 43 games, he averaged 7.3 points and 5.3 assists, ranking 11th in the league in the latter category.

Towards the end of the season, on March 30, 2009, Clinkscales was acquired from the player pool by the <a href="Rio%20Grande%20Valley%20Vipers">Rio Grande Valley Vipers</a> of the D-League. To make room for him in their roster, the Vipers had to waive veteran <a href="Jeff%20Trepagnier">Jeff Trepagnier</a>. Head coach <a href="Clay%20Moser">Clay Moser</a> described Clinkscales' arrival as a boon to the team, saying, "We like Cliff's ability to get into the middle of the <a href="key%20%28basketball%29">lane</a> and create shots for others." Clinkscales was expected to join the Vipers as the backup point guard to <a href="Jared%20Jordan">Jared Jordan</a>. He only played 12 minutes in his debut with the team, with zero points and three assists against the <a href="Delaware%2087ers">Utah Flash</a> on April 1. He capped the season with a double-double of 12 points and ten assists vs. the <a href="Austin%20Spurs">Austin Spurs</a>. By the end of the season, he was averaging 7.2 points, 5.3 assists, and 2.4 rebounds.

Following his brief stint with the BayHawks, and subsequent signing by the Vipers, Clinkscales was eventually named on the latter's training camp roster. However, on November 17, 2009, he was cut from the roster during preseason. As a result, he reunited with the Erie BayHawks in mid-December. In his first appearance after rejoining the Bayhawks, he recorded nine points, seven assists, and four rebounds in a loss to the Iowa Energy on December 19. In another notable performance vs. Iowa Energy that month, Clinkscales scored 14 points and notched a season-best 16 assists. Despite his strong passing numbers, he was criticized for being a poor <a href="jump%20shot%20%28basketball%29">jump shooter</a>. After 39 games in the season, he averaged 5.1 points, 5.1 assists, and 1.6 rebounds per game. That season, he finished six different games with ten or more assists.

After leaving the D-League, Clinkscales signed in 2013 with the Panama City Breeze of the semi-professional <a href="American%20Basketball%20League%20%282013%29">American Basketball League</a> (ABL), with no indication that he joined any other team since his tenure with the BayHawks. On February 16, 2013, he scored 12 points with two three-pointers in a loss to the Emerald Coast Knights. While with the Breeze, Clinkscales (and his teammates) endured financial and domestic difficulties. He lived with five other teammates in a <a href="duplex%20%28building%29">duplex house</a> in <a href="Bay%20County%2C%20Florida">Bay County, Florida</a>. Because of financial issues, the league failed to pay the players—with Clinkscales solely receiving a check of $400—and canceled several games on its schedule. Later in the season, the players' duplex was supposedly leased by Breeze's head coach, Ty Fisher. A local broker filed a civil lawsuit against Fisher to evict the players, and county sheriff deputies soon forced them to leave the house. While living in the area, the players received aid from a local resident, Vonda Gainer, who they met at a <a href="Dollar%20Tree">Dollar Tree</a> store. Gainer gave them food and washed their clothes. Despite their poor living conditions, the players failed to receive any aid by the league, with no contact or assurance from league CEO Steve Haney.

In February 2014, shortly after his time with the Breeze, Clinkscales joined the <a href="Halifax%20Rainmen">Halifax Rainmen</a> of the <a href="National%20Basketball%20League%20of%20Canada">National Basketball League of Canada</a> (NBL) for the remainder of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20NBL%20Canada%20season">2013–14 season</a>. In his first game for the Rainmen on February 11, he had six points, four rebounds, and nine assists against the <a href="Island%20Storm">Island Storm</a>. Clinkscales scored a season-high 22 points along with 11 assists in a playoff win over the <a href="Saint%20John%20Mill%20Rats">Saint John Mill Rats</a> on March 7. In the following game vs. the Mill Rats on March 9, he set the NBL Canada postseason record with 18 assists in a single game. He finished the series with a total of 52 assists—the most in a four-game playoff series in league history. In the following round against the Storm, Clinkscales accumulated 68 assists, an NBL Canada record for a six-game series. He finished the season averaging 11 points, 9.8 assists, and 3.3 rebounds.

On April 20, 2014, Clinkscales represented the <a href="Atlantic%20Division%20%28NBL%20Canada%29">Atlantic Division</a> at the <a href="2014%20NBL%20Canada%20All-Star%20Game">NBL Canada All-Star Game</a> in <a href="Charlottetown">Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island</a>. He finished with four points, two rebounds, and a game-high 15 assists, as his team defeated the <a href="Central%20Division%20%28NBL%20Canada%29">Central Division</a>.

On May 14, 2014, Clinkscales was announced as one of six protected players on the Rainmen roster for the upcoming season, meaning that he could not be approached by any other NBL Canada team. On June 23, Clinkscales re-signed with the Rainmen for the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20NBL%20Canada%20season">2014–15 season</a>. The team, which parted ways with their head coach <a href="Craig%20Hodges">Craig Hodges</a>, aimed to return many of its players from the previous season. Rainmen owner <a href="Andre%20Levingston">Andre Levingston</a> commented, "We are extremely excited to have our team leader and floor general back. Our fans loved Cliff's passion for the game, and (he) is fast becoming the face of our team's organization." On November 7, the Rainmen lost their season opener to the <a href="Moncton%20Miracles">Moncton Miracles</a>, 113–117, with Clinkscales accounting for nine points and eight assists. He posted a double-double in a win over their follow-up with the Miracles on November 23, recording ten points and a team-high ten assists off the bench. On November 29, he notched 14 points and eight assists vs. the Island Storm. Flourishing as a point-guard, Clinkscales scored a season-best 16 points against the Storm on February 26, 2015. In a postseason victory vs. the Miracles on March 8, he had a season-high 12 assists.

The Rainmen went on to qualify for the <a href="2015%20NBL%20Canada%20Finals">2015 Finals</a> against the <a href="Windsor%20Express">Windsor Express</a>. In their Game 1 defeat, Clinkscales committed three <a href="personal%20foul%20%28basketball%29">fouls</a> within the first 12 minutes, but still managed to score 13 points. The series featured several physical and verbal altercations, and after it was tied at three games apiece, the Rainmen chose to forfeit the deciding seventh game. Prior to the contest, a <a href="2015%20NBL%20Canada%20Finals%20brawl">brawl</a> occurred between members of both sides. The league fined Clinkscales, along with ten of his teammates, $5,000 each for poor <a href="sportsmanship">sportsmanship</a> on the court. They were also suspended indefinitely from the NBL Canada during the investigation. Commenting on the incident, Clinkscales later explained, "We practice hard against each other, we beat each other up, but there's a difference between being physical and dirty and hurting people." The league fined players, coaches, and teams a total of $90,000, and the Rainmen ultimately collapsed after facing bankruptcy. Clinkscales ended the season averaging 6.6 points, 5.9 assists, and 1.4 steals per game.

For the 2015–2016 season, the Rainmen reformed under new ownership as the <a href="Halifax%20Hurricanes">Halifax Hurricanes</a>. Levingston remained the team's general manager. Clinkscales returned to the Halifax team, but he had to play with mostly new teammates and a new coach in <a href="Hugo%20L%C3%B3pez">Hugo López</a>. Clinkscales eventually assumed the position of team <a href="captain%20%28sports%29">captain</a> during the season.

In the Hurricanes' regular season opener on <a href="Boxing%20Day">Boxing Day</a> 2015, Clinkscales added 13 points to help overcome the Moncton Miracles. He went on to break the double-digit scoring mark on January 23, 2016, in a victory against the Island Storm, when he had ten points and a game-high seven assists. On January 28, Clinkscales posted his first double-double of the season, with a season-best 18 points and ten assists in a loss to the Saint John Mill Rats. The Hurricanes were unable to rally from a 15-point fourth-quarter deficit. Clinkscales had another double-double on February 14 against the <a href="Orangeville%20A%27s">Orangeville A's</a>, recording ten points and ten assists to push Halifax to a 125–89 win. He also notched four steals, which would be a season high. On March 10, playing point guard, he scored 18 points once again, along with ten assists, as the Hurricanes captured only their second win of the season, over the Mill Rats. Two games later, on March 18, Clinkscales recorded 10 points, 16 assists, and seven rebounds—season bests for the latter two categories. His team won the game in overtime against the A's. Halifax entered the playoffs with a league-best 29–11 record, and they eventually returned to the NBL Canada Finals. On June 14, the Hurricanes won the championship over the <a href="London%20Lightning">London Lightning</a>, prevailing in the series 4–3. Clinkscales scored nine points and passed a team-high nine assists in the victory. His role as a leader within the squad was evidenced by his directing of the crowd at the <a href="Scotiabank%20Centre">Scotiabank Centre</a>. He remarked, "It feels great to get it with this group of guys." Clinkscales finished the season averaging 6.9 points, 8.0 assists, 2.5 rebounds, and 1.4 steals per game. In mid-August 2016, he announced through his <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> account that he would not return to the Hurricanes during the 2016–17 season. He also considered beginning a coaching career.

Despite his previous claims, Clinkscales re-signed with the Hurricanes for the 2016–17 season on October 18, 2016, having been persuaded to make the decision by newly hired head coach <a href="Kevin%20Keathley">Kevin Keathley</a>. Clinkscales said, "I am very excited to be returning to Halifax. I love the city and all of our supporters. I'm ready to work hard and build a team to defend our title with Coach Keathley. Da General is back!" However, Keathley was replaced by Mike Leslie by the start of the season. On December 26, in his season debut, Clinkscales scored six points, grabbed five rebounds, and passed for a team-high five assists to defeat the Moncton Miracles. He had another notable performance on January 12, 2017 vs. the Island Storm, scoring no points but recording 13 assists. Clinkscales and the Hurricanes ultimately made it to the NBL Canada Finals before losing to the London Lightning in 6 games. Clinkscales was named to the All-NBL Canada Second Team at the end of the season with the league stating "Nine Hurricanes had more points than Clinkscales this season, but all can credit much of their scoring to the savvy point guard, who ranked second in NBLC with 300 assists while executing with a league-leading 4.48 assist-to-turnover rate. He had 11 double-digit assist games."

Clinkscales often plays <a href="streetball">streetball</a> with the Sean Bell All-Stars against local teams in New York City, acting as the starting point guard. The team was named after an <a href="Sean%20Bell%20shooting%20incident">unarmed New York native</a> who was shot 50 times by three police officers on November 25, 2006.

Romney Literary Society

The Romney Literary Society (also known as the Literary Society of Romney) existed from January 30, 1819, to February 15, 1886, in <a href="Romney%2C%20West%20Virginia">Romney, West Virginia</a>. Established as the Polemic Society of Romney, it became the first organization of its kind in the present-day state of West Virginia, and one of the first in the United States. The society was founded by nine prominent men of Romney with the objectives of advancing literature and science, purchasing and maintaining a library, and improving educational opportunities.

The society debated an extensive range of scientific and social topics, often violating its own rules which banned religious and political subjects. Even though its membership was relatively small, its debates and activities were frequently discussed throughout the <a href="Potomac%20Highlands%20of%20West%20Virginia">Potomac Highlands</a> region, and the organization greatly influenced trends of thought in the Romney community and surrounding areas.

The society's library began in 1819 with the acquisition of two books; by 1861, it had grown to contain approximately 3,000 volumes on subjects such as literature, science, history, and art. The organization also sought to establish an institution for "the higher education of the youth of the community." In 1820, as a result of this initiative, the teaching of the classics was introduced into the curriculum of <a href="Romney%20Academy">Romney Academy</a>, thus making the institution the first school of higher education in the <a href="Eastern%20Panhandle%20of%20West%20Virginia">Eastern Panhandle</a>. In 1846, the society constructed a building which housed the <a href="Romney%20Classical%20Institute">Romney Classical Institute</a> and its library, both of which fell under the society's supervision. The institute was administered by noted Presbyterian Reverend <a href="William%20Henry%20Foote">William Henry Foote</a>. Following a dispute with the society, Foote founded a rival school in Romney, known as the Potomac Seminary, in 1850.

The Romney Literary Society and the Romney Classical Institute continued to grow in influence until the onset of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> in 1861. The contents of the society's library were plundered by <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> forces, and only 400 of the library's volumes could be recovered following the war's end in 1865. Reorganized in 1869, the society took a leading role in Romney's civil development during <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a>. Between 1869 and 1870, it completed construction of <a href="Literary%20Hall">Literary Hall</a>, where the society held meetings and reassembled its library. The organization used its influence to secure the <a href="West%20Virginia%20Schools%20for%20the%20Deaf%20and%20Blind">West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind</a> for the town of Romney, and offered the school its former Romney Classical Institute campus. The schools opened on September 29, 1870. Interest in the society waned during its final years, and its last recorded meeting was held in 1886.

The Romney Literary Society was organized on January 30, 1819, by nine prominent men of Romney in the office of Dr. John Temple, a reputable physician in the community. The society was formed with the purpose "of taking into consideration the propriety of financing a Society, having for its object the advancement of Literature and Science, the purchase of a Library by and for the use of its members; and their further improvement by discussing before the Society such questions as shall be selected under its directors." With its establishment, the Romney Literary Society became the first organization of its kind in the present-day state of West Virginia, and one of the first in the United States. The nine men at the society's first meeting were Thomas Blair, David Gibson, James P. Jack, Samuel Kercheval, Jr., Nathaniel Kuykendall, Charles T. Magill, James M. Stephens, John Temple, and William C. Wodrow. According to historian <a href="Hu%20Maxwell">Hu Maxwell</a>, these men elected Kuykendall as chairman and Magill as secretary of a committee which was charged with the drafting of a constitution for the society.

On February 4, 1819, the committee delivered its draft of the constitution and the society adopted the document, which provided that the organization should be known as the Polemic Society of Romney. The society's constitution also specified that the officers should consist of a president, secretary, and treasurer, each of whom was to be selected by a ballot vote. The constitution further stipulated that each member was to pay dues of 50 cents per month, and that the society had the authority to levy further financial contributions from its members as it deemed necessary. The funds collected were to cover the society's operating costs, and the remaining funds were to be used in purchasing books for the library. Under the constitution, the society's meetings were to be held weekly. Following each meeting's business session, a debate or other literary exercises were to be held consisting of topics of general interest of the members. No political or religious discussions were to take place during the debates unless they were of an abstract nature or in general terms. Profane language and "spirituous liquors" were also forbidden from the society's meetings, with each offense being punishable with a fine of one dollar. The society's first elected officers were Charles T. Magill as president, William C. Wodrow as secretary, and John Temple as treasurer.

The society's next meeting was held on February 13, 1819, in the old <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Courthouse%20%28West%20Virginia%29">Hampshire County Courthouse</a>, where the first matter for debate was "Resolved: That a representative should be governed by instructions from his constituents." Following the debate, the decision was rendered in favor of the affirmative. The second meeting, which was held on February 19 of that year at the <a href="Romney%20Academy">Romney Academy</a>, debated the question, "Is an education acquired at the public school or [is] a private tutor to be preferred?" and the society favored the public school. At this second meeting, the first money appropriated by the society was paid to the doorkeeper for a sum of 25 cents. Also at this second meeting, the treasurer was instructed to purchase a book for use by the secretary, three candlesticks, one pair of <a href="Candle%20snuffer">snuffers</a>, and three pounds of candles. On February 26, the society argued the question, "Is a system of banking advantageous to a community?" The debate ended under the decision that a system of banking was advantageous. The following meeting on March 6 debated a question far more psychological in nature, which was an abstract question of religion: "Can the human mind, by its own reflection, arrive at the conclusion that the soul is immortal?" The society decided in the negative. The society also debated and decided in the negative the question, "Is a protective <a href="tariff">tariff</a> detrimental to the interests of the country?"

One of the society's more spirited debates occurred in May 1822 over the question, "Is it to the interest of the people of Hampshire to encourage the canalling of the Potomac?" While no records of the arguments survive, the society decided that the canalling of the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac River</a> would be detrimental to the interests of Hampshire County. The debate took place before the construction of the <a href="Chesapeake%20and%20Ohio%20Canal">Chesapeake and Ohio Canal</a> along the Maryland shore of the Potomac River to the north of Hampshire County. The society's consensus was that a canal on the Potomac would destroy the business of <a href="teamster">teamster</a>s who hauled merchandise from the east along the <a href="Northwestern%20Turnpike">Northwestern Turnpike</a>. For this reason, the society and local population of Romney also objected to the construction of the <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a>. To ensure confidentiality, the society passed a bylaw that enforced a fine of five dollars on any member who published either his own or another member's speeches delivered before the society. As a result of this bylaw, no speeches were ever published. The society adopted a new constitution in 1824.

Over the first ten years of the society's existence, the organization grew in membership and held meetings at least twice a month, and usually four times a month. The society debated an extensive range of subjects including scientific, religious, political, and social topics, often violating the constitution's rules banning religious and political subjects. The society's debates were often acrimonious and regularly spilled beyond the confines of the meetings and into the community. Between January 30, 1819 and January 22, 1830, the society's membership rolls reached 52 members; although as few as 15 members attended the bimonthly meetings, and no more than 17 members were ever present at a meeting.

Even though the Romney Literary Society's membership was relatively small, its debates and activities were frequently discussed throughout the <a href="Potomac%20Highlands%20of%20West%20Virginia">Potomac Highlands</a> region. For this reason, the society greatly influenced trends of thought in the Romney community and surrounding areas. No records of the society's proceedings, works, or membership enrollments spanning the period between January 22, 1830 and 1861 are extant. During this period, the society counted among its members <a href="Angus%20William%20McDonald">Angus William McDonald</a>, <a href="John%20Baker%20White%20%28Virginia%29">John Baker White</a>, and <a href="Robert%20White%20%28attorney%20general%29">Robert White</a>.

In order to fulfill one of its primary purposes of establishing a library for its members, the Romney Literary Society gradually began to acquire volumes for such a use. The society's library began with the April 23, 1819 appropriation for the purchase of two books: <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>'s "<a href="Parallel%20Lives">Parallel Lives</a>" and <a href="Emer%20de%20Vattel">Emer de Vattel</a>'s "<a href="The%20Law%20of%20Nations">The Law of Nations</a>". On July 2, 1819, the balance of available funds in the treasurer's account was two dollars and forty-six cents, but by October 23, there were sufficient funds to purchase the following volumes: <a href="Charles%20Rollin">Charles Rollin</a>'s "Ancient History", Lewis' "Roman History", and <a href="William%20Robertson%20%28historian%29">William Robertson</a>'s "History of the Reign of Charles the Fifth".

No more volumes were purchased until the end of 1820, when the society acquired the works of <a href="Livy">Livy</a>, <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>, and <a href="John%20Marshall">John Marshall</a>'s "Life of Washington". Three months later, the society purchased a bookcase for its growing collection. In April 1821, the society further expanded its library with the acquisitions of <a href="Nathaniel%20Hooke">Nathaniel Hooke</a>'s "Roman History, from the Building of Rome to the Ruin of the Commonwealth", the works of <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, "Travels in Greece", "Modern Europe", <a href="David%20Ramsay%20%28historian%29">David Ramsay</a>'s "History of the United States", and the works of <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>.

In 1821, the <a href="Virginia%20General%20Assembly">Virginia General Assembly</a> passed an act <a href="Incorporation%20%28business%29">incorporating</a> the organization as the "Library Society of Romney." The society found the assembly's charter unsatisfactory, as it specified several changes to the organization that the society had not asked for, including the change in its name. The members regarded their society as a "literary" society and not a "library" one. The society requested that the assembly amend its charter, and after several delays and debates over the new charter, the Virginia General Assembly passed a new act on February 4, 1823, in which the organization was rebranded as "The Literary Society of Romney." The society maintained this long form name throughout the duration of its existence, although it was locally known as the "Romney Literary Society."

Within the span of ten years, the society's small library grew to contain approximately 3,000 volumes on literature, science, history, and art. These were bound in calfskin and stamped with the seal of the society. The minutes from the society's bimonthly meetings listed the books purchased and the methods by which they were acquired. According to the <a href="Federal%20Writers%27%20Project">Federal Writers' Project</a> in their "Historic Romney 1762–1937" (1937), the book selections and their acquisition "indicate that these men possessed real literary judgment and business ability."

By resolutions of the society, the use of the library was for the society's members, and was further extended to "ministers of the gospel of all denominations "gratis"." Certain citizens of Romney were also granted access to the library, and enjoyed similar privileges as its members.

From the organization's foundation, the Romney Literary Society gradually began to recognize that the local subscription school systems provided only elementary and often fragmentary education and no longer satisfied the academic needs of the Romney community. The society periodically engaged in lengthy deliberations on which theories of educational advancement and popular education were preferable. Shortly after its establishment, the society commenced a movement to establish an institution for "the higher education of the youth of the community." In 1820, as a result of this initiative, the teaching of the classics was introduced into the curriculum of Romney Academy, thus making the institution the first school of higher education in the <a href="Eastern%20Panhandle%20of%20West%20Virginia">Eastern Panhandle</a>. Under the guidance, leadership, and strict discipline of Dr. Henry Johnston, Romney Academy became widely renowned for its courses in "higher classics." His successor and society member <a href="William%20Henry%20Foote">William Henry Foote</a> introduced courses in <a href="theology">theology</a>, and the school's enrollment grew to include students preparing for ministry. As the school became more renowned in the <a href="Potomac%20River%23South%20Branch%20Potomac%20River">South Branch Potomac River</a> valley, pupils came from further and further away. <a href="Thomas%20Mulledy">Thomas Mulledy</a> and Samuel Mulledy were among the early instructors at the academy, both of whom later served as presidents of <a href="Georgetown%20University">Georgetown University</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>

By 1831, Romney Academy had outgrown its facilities in the old stone school building behind the Hampshire County Courthouse. To remedy this, the society instituted a campaign to raise funds for a new school building. On January 6, 1832, the Virginia General Assembly authorized the society to raise an endowment of $20,000 in a lottery for educational purposes. Following a ten-year lapse, the society made arrangements with James Gregory of <a href="Jersey%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Jersey City</a> and Daniel McIntyre of <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> to finance a lottery "for raising a sum of money not exceeding twenty thousand dollars, for the purpose of erecting a suitable building for their accommodation, the purchase of library and Philosophical apparatus." The lottery was to be conducted over a period of ten years, and sums of $750, $1,000, and $1,500 were to be raised in semiannual installments. The society was successful in raising funds, and in 1845 the society solicited bids for the construction of a new building to house both the academy, the society, and the society's library. The society also used the lottery funds to pay for books for the academy.

On February 12, 1844, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act authorizing the society to denote the balance of the moneys raised by the lottery to the Romney Academy. The assembly further enacted another legislative act on December 12, 1846, authorizing the Romney Literary Society to "establish at or near the town of Romney a Seminary of Learning for the instruction of youth in various branches of science and literature; and the Society map appropriate to the same such portion of the property which it now has or may acquire, as it may deem expedient." That same year, a new brick <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">neoclassical</a> building was constructed east of Romney, and the society, its library, and Romney Academy relocated to the new facility. The second story of the new building was utilized by the society, with one hall for meetings and the other hall for the society's library. According to Maxwell, "few schools in the state of Virginia at that time had access to better libraries." The new institute building and grounds cost the society about $8,000. Following its move to the new building, the academy was reorganized as the <a href="Romney%20Classical%20Institute">Romney Classical Institute</a> and its activities fell under the supervision of the society. The institute was operated under the principalship of Foote from 1846 until 1849.

In 1849, the society presented a new code and system of bylaws for the government of the Romney Classical Institute, which reserved to the society the power to appoint assistant teachers, fix the amount of salaries, and provide the conditions and manners of payment and reimbursement. Foote differed with the society over these matters, and he ultimately declined to accept the new bylaws and resigned his leadership position in October 1849; in 1850, he established a rival institution known as the Potomac Seminary. Rather than falling under the patronage of the society, Foote's new institution fell under the control of the Presbyterian church. Following Foote's departure, the society selected Professor E. J. Meany to head the Romney Classical Institute. Despite the schism, the society also provided financial support from the lottery to the Potomac Seminary.

According to a "catalogue of the members and library" published on June 1, 1849, there were 20 registered members on the rolls who paid $3 each per year to the society's library fund; there were also eight library members who were admitted under certain regulations of the society and who paid the same fees. Members who had use of the library were provided keys and were allowed access to the library at any time. The town's clergymen and the principal of the Romney Classical Institute were the only non-members who were extended privileges to the library. The 1849 "catalogue" listed Alfred P. White as the society's librarian and E. J. Meany remained the principal of the institute. After 1853, the society possessed a permanent fund of $12,000, which yielded $720 per year, one half of which was devoted to the support of the Romney Classical Institute.

The Romney Literary Society and the Romney Classical Institute flourished and continued to grow in importance and influence until the onset of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> in 1861. Following the war's outbreak, many of the society's members and the institute's professors and older students joined the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate States Army</a> and marched to war. During the war, the society suffered extensive losses. The Romney Classical Institute building and its library were considered legitimate plunder by <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> forces. The society's library was emptied and three-fourths of its volumes were either scattered or destroyed. The most valuable of these volumes were never recovered following the war's end. Its records of proceedings between 1830 and 1861, the period during which the society engaged in most of its notable literary and philanthropic works, were also destroyed during the war.

Following the war's end, only 400 out of the library's nearly 3,000 volumes could be recovered, with only 200 of those books remaining on the library's shelves. Between 10 and 20 of the library's recovered volumes only contained three to four of their original books. The value of the recovered volumes was degraded, as many were damaged or broken. The society members that returned home to Romney were too war-weary to revive the society when they discovered the ruins of the Romney Classical Institute and its library, which had been an expensive endeavor to accumulate and took almost a half-century of labor to amass. The Romney Classical Institute was not restored and was in effect disestablished on account of the war.

Following the war, the residents of Romney set about repairing public buildings and reestablishing the town's antebellum institutions, including the Romney Literary Society. The society remained on a hiatus until May 15, 1869 when a meeting was held by nine members, as only nine original members had responded to the call for reorganization. These nine members tasked with rebuilding the society were James L. Armstrong, David Entler, William Harper, John C. Heiskell, Andrew Wodrow Kercheval, Samuel R. Lupton, James Parsons, Alfred P. White, and Robert White. These men sought to collect what remained of the library's books and engaged in a campaign to recruit new members, which resulted in the enrollment of 20 younger men over a period of a few years. Many of the men who had been members in 1861 had died during the war, and the recruitment of new members was essential to the revival of the society. Among the new members elected between 1869 and 1886 were <a href="John%20Collins%20Covell">John Collins Covell</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Lightfoot%20Flournoy%20%28West%20Virginia%20senator%29">Samuel Lightfoot Flournoy</a>, <a href="Henry%20Bell%20Gilkeson">Henry Bell Gilkeson</a>, <a href="Howard%20Hille%20Johnson">Howard Hille Johnson</a>, and <a href="Christian%20Streit%20White">Christian Streit White</a>. The society, with renewed vigor, took a lead role in Romney's civil development during the <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction Era</a>.

Between 1869 and 1870, the society completed construction of a new two-story brick building on Lot 56 at the corner of West Main and North High Streets known as <a href="Literary%20Hall">Literary Hall</a>, where it could hold its meetings and reassemble the remaining volumes from its original library. Literary Hall was built upon the former location of the shuttered Bank of the South Branch of the Potomac. In addition to the 400 volumes that were initially recovered following the war, the society recovered several more volumes from its original library, and set about purchasing new books; the restored library was reopened with about 700 volumes.

Around the time of the society's reorganization in 1869, the state of West Virginia considered the establishment of a school for the deaf and the blind. The society resolved to secure the new state institution for Romney. On April 12, 1870, the society passed a resolution by which the members agreed to deed, free of cost, the buildings and grounds of the Romney Classical Institute.

On April 20, 1870, the society sent Andrew Wodrow Kercheval and Robert White as representatives to the then-state capital <a href="Wheeling%2C%20West%20Virginia">Wheeling</a> to present their formal offer of "the grounds and buildings of the Romney Classical Institute... to the Board of Regents, free of debt, and in good repair" on the condition that the proposed school be located in Romney. <a href="Clarksburg%2C%20West%20Virginia">Clarksburg</a> and <a href="Parkersburg%2C%20West%20Virginia">Parkersburg</a> also made offers of potential campuses to the state. The offer was made to the Board of Regents of the West Virginia Institute for the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind, as it was then known, and the society's proposal was accepted by the regents after a brief period of deliberation. The society's offer was the only one that included a building upon the grounds.

It was discovered by the society that in order to follow through with their proposition, it was necessary to raise more than $1,000, which was ostensibly a difficult task during the Reconstruction Era in Romney. On July 11, 1870, the Board of Regents passed a resolution necessitating the subscription of between $1,200 and $1,300 to facilitate the transaction. One hundred and eighteen individuals and firms responded to the board's request with a total subscription of $1,383.60. To make good on its offer, the society also made an appropriation of $320 on July 11 for the purpose of repairing and restoring the former Romney Classical Institute and grounds so that they were satisfactory before they were transferred to the regents. Shortly thereafter, the old institute building and of property were formally transferred to the state of West Virginia.

On September 29, 1870, the institute, which was later known as the <a href="West%20Virginia%20Schools%20for%20the%20Deaf%20and%20Blind">West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind</a>, opened its doors in the old Romney Classical Institute building with 25 deaf and five blind students. Following its disestablishment in 1916, the adjacent Potomac Academy (formerly Potomac Seminary) grounds were also incorporated into the campus of the Schools for the Deaf and Blind.

During a period of ten years spanning from 1870 to 1880, much of Romney's intellectual life centered on Literary Hall. During this time, the society met only occasionally and there were no records of meetings between March 1872 and April 1878. The post-war period of revival was short-lived, as the death of the older members caused interest in the society to wane. The society's meetings occurred less often, and the last recorded meeting of the society was held on February 15, 1886. During the society's second existence, Literary Hall was used as a meeting space by the <a href="Freemasonry">Freemasons</a> and the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Eastern%20Star">Order of the Eastern Star</a>, and the organizations continued to inhabit the hall following the society's disestablishment until its 1974 purchase by attorney Ralph Haines. Also a local historian, Haines restored Literary Hall and used it as his law office and museum. Literary Hall was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on May 29, 1979, and, as of 2004, it is occasionally open to the public. The society's remaining records, dating as early as 1819, remain on display there.

In describing the efforts of the Romney Literary Society, historian Hu Maxwell, in his "History of Hampshire County, West Virginia From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present" (1897), stated that "the work accomplished by these few energetic citizens of Romney is astonishing." Maxwell further asserted, "No other one thing in the history of the town has had such lasting results for good." The society left many lasting impacts upon the town of Romney during its existence and beyond, which included the foundation of a library; the academic and financial support and patronage of the Romney Academy, Romney Classical Institute, and the Potomac Seminary; the civic leadership during the Reconstruction Era; and the influence and assistance in securing the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind. According to Maxwell, without the efforts of the society, the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind could not have been secured for Romney, and would have likely been located elsewhere in the state.

Civil Service Rifles War Memorial

The Civil Service Rifles War Memorial is a <a href="World%20War%20I%20memorials">First World War memorial</a> located on the riverside terrace at <a href="Somerset%20House">Somerset House</a> in central London, England. Designed by <a href="Sir%20Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a> and unveiled in 1924, the memorial commemorates the 1,240 members of the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales%27%20Own%20Civil%20Service%20Rifles">Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles</a> regiment who were killed in the First World War. They were <a href="Territorial%20Force">Territorial Force</a> reservists, drawn largely from the <a href="Civil%20Service%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British Civil Service</a>, which at that time had many staff based at Somerset House.

Both battalions of the expanded Civil Service Rifles were disbanded shortly after the war; the regiment amalgamated with the <a href="Queen%27s%20Westminster%20Rifles">Queen's Westminster Rifles</a>, but former members established an Old Comrades Association to keep the regiment's traditions alive. The association began raising funds for a war memorial in 1920, and <a href="Edward%20VIII">the Prince of Wales</a> unveiled the memorial on 27 January 1924. It takes the form of a single rectangular column surmounted by a sculpture of an urn and flanked by painted stone flags, the <a href="Union%20Flag">Union Flag</a> on one side and the <a href="Military%20colours%2C%20standards%20and%20guidons%23United_Kingdom">regimental colour</a> on the other. The base on which the column stands is inscribed with the regiment's <a href="battle%20honour">battle honour</a>s, while an inscription on the column denotes that a scroll containing the names of the fallen was placed inside.

The memorial first stood in the quadrangle of Somerset House, which the Civil Service Rifles had used as a parade ground, but the civil service began to vacate Somerset House towards the end of the 20th century. As the building and its courtyard were re-purposed, the memorial was moved to the riverside terrace in the late 1990s. Members of the regiment continued to attend <a href="Remembrance%20Sunday">Remembrance Sunday</a> ceremonies until at least the late 1980s, by which time many former members were in their nineties; the last known surviving member of the regiment attended a rededication ceremony in 2002. The memorial was designated a grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> in 1987, which was upgraded to grade II* in November 2015 when it became part of a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials.

In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>, described by <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> as "the leading English architect of his generation". Lutyens established his reputation designing <a href="country%20house">country house</a>s for wealthy clients, but the war had a profound effect on him, and following it he devoted much of his time to memorialising its casualties. He became a public figure through his design for <a href="the%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">the Cenotaph</a> on <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a>, which became Britain's national war memorial. This, along with his work for the <a href="Imperial%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Imperial War Graves Commission</a>, led to commissions for war memorials across Britain and the empire. As well as memorials for towns and cities, Lutyens was commissioned to design memorials for several private companies and regimental associations, including the Civil Service Rifles. These were among the least controversial of Lutyens' war memorials, as sites and funds tended to be readily available.
The Civil Service Rifles—properly named the "15th (County of London) Battalion, the <a href="London%20Regiment">London Regiment</a> (the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales%27%20Own%20Civil%20Service%20Rifles">Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles</a>)"—was a unit in the <a href="Territorial%20Force">Territorial Force</a>, a part-time reserve element of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>. The regiment's members were drawn from the <a href="Civil%20Service%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Civil Service</a>, the permanent administrative apparatus of the British government. Many civil servants were based at <a href="Somerset%20House">Somerset House</a>, an important government office building, and the regiment used its quadrangle as a parade ground. 

Forming part of the <a href="4th%20London%20Brigade">4th London Brigade</a>, in the <a href="2nd%20London%20Division">2nd London Division</a>, the soldiers were at their annual <a href="Military%20camp">camp</a> on <a href="Salisbury%20Plain">Salisbury Plain</a> when Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914. The battalion was mobilised the same day and sent for training in <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>, before being deployed to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in 1915. It arrived at <a href="Le%20Havre">Le Havre</a> on 18 March and came under the command of the <a href="140th%20%284th%20London%29%20Brigade">140th (4th London) Brigade</a>, part of the <a href="47th%20%281/2nd%20London%29%20Division">47th (London) Division</a>. It was in action at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Loos">Battle of Loos</a> in 1915, the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Battle of the Somme</a> in 1916, and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Battle of Passchendaele</a> in 1917, and during the <a href="Hundred%20Days%20Offensive">Hundred Days Offensive</a> in 1918. A second battalion was raised and served in France, then <a href="Macedonian%20Front">Salonika</a> and <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">Palestine</a>. Both battalions were disbanded after the war, having lost 1,240 officers and men out of approximately 7,000 who served overseas with the regiment.
After the war, the demobilised soldiers formed an Old Comrades Association, and discussion turned to commemorating the regiment's dead. The association formed a War Memorial Committee, chaired by Major W. H. Kirby, and established an appeal to raise £750 for the construction of a memorial. The funds were raised largely from donations from former members of the regiment, aided by the proceeds from sales of a regimental history.

The committee first commissioned the architect <a href="Herbert%20Baker">Herbert Baker</a> to produce a design, which was approved by the <a href="Office%20of%20Works">Office of Works</a> in June 1919. Baker proposed to site the memorial in the north end of the quadrangle at Somerset House, behind the <a href="Statue%20of%20George%20III%2C%20Somerset%20House">statue of King George III</a>. Some time after the approval, the committee replaced Baker with Sir Edwin Lutyens, who was adamant that the memorial should stand in the centre of the quadrangle. To this the Office of Works objected, concerned about the effect a memorial in such a prominent location would have on the surrounding 18th-century architecture. The office eventually relented after Lutyens examined <a href="William%20Chambers%20%28architect%29">Sir William Chambers</a>' original plans and argued that Chambers had intended to place a central object in the quadrangle.

The memorial is in the form of a single rectangular column of <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a>, which is decorated with classical mouldings and stands approximately tall. At the top is a shallow <a href="cornice">cornice</a>, on which stands a <a href="plinth">plinth</a> supporting a sculpture of an <a href="urn">urn</a> at the very top. The plinth is decorated with laurel <a href="Festoon">swags</a>. The column itself stands on a square, coved base which in turn rests on a platform of two square steps. Painted stone flags hang from either side of the column—the regiment's <a href="Military%20colours%2C%20standards%20and%20guidons%23United%20Kingdom">colours</a> on the east side (the right, when viewed from the front) and the <a href="Flag%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Union Flag</a> on the west (left). The flags were originally copper but were later replaced with carved stone. No names are listed on the memorial, but a scroll containing the names of the regiment's dead from the First World War was placed inside the column. Lutyens intended his design to be harmonious with the surrounding stone architecture of Somerset House, though the <a href="polychromy">polychromy</a> of the flags stood out. Painted stone flags are a recurring feature in Lutyens' war memorial designs; he first proposed them for the Cenotaph, where they were rejected in favour of fabric, though they feature on several of his other designs. 

On the front (north) face is inscribed the dedication , while the south face reads: . The start and end dates of the war are inscribed in Roman numerals below the urn, "MCMXIV" on the north side and "MCMXIX" on the south. The regiment's <a href="battle%20honour">battle honour</a>s are inscribed around the base: <a href="Battle%20of%20Festubert">Festubert</a>, Loos, Somme, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Flers%E2%80%93Courcelette">Flers–Courcelette</a> on the south side; <a href="Battle%20of%20Doiran%20%281917%29">Doiran</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Lys%20%281918%29">Lys/Kemmel</a>, <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20Gaza">Gaza</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Nebi%20Samwil">Nebi Samwil</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> on the west; <a href="Battle%20of%20St.%20Quentin%20%281918%29">St Quentin</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Albert%20%281918%29">Albert</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Ancre">Ancre</a>, <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bapaume">Bapaume</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Selle">Selle</a> on the north; and <a href="Battle%20of%20Le%20Transloy">Transloy</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Messines%20%281918%29">Messines</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Ypres</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Cambrai%20%281917%29">Cambrai</a> on the east face.

The memorial was made at <a href="Nine%20Elms%20Stone%20Masonry%20Works">Nine Elms Stone Masonry Works</a> in <a href="Battersea">Battersea</a>, south London. It was unveiled by the regiment's honorary colonel, <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward, Prince of Wales</a> (wearing the uniform of <a href="Welsh%20Guards">Welsh Guards</a> colonel) and dedicated by the Reverend E. H. Beattie, the 1st Battalion's chaplain, at a ceremony on 27 January 1924. Music was provided by the regimental band and the choir from the nearby <a href="St%20Clement%20Danes">St Clement Danes</a> church. The <a href="Last%20Post">Last Post</a> and the <a href="Reveille">Reveille</a> were sounded and the crowd sung the national anthem, <a href="God%20Save%20the%20King">God Save the King</a>. Among others present was the Suffragan <a href="Bishop%20of%20Willesden">Bishop of Willesden</a>, <a href="William%20Perrin%20%28bishop%29">William Perrin</a>, as well as several senior army officers, former members of the regiment, their families, and relatives of deceased members. By the time of the ceremony, post-war reorganisations had reduced the Civil Service Rifles in size to two companies and amalgamated it with the Queen's Westminster Rifles to form the 16th Battalion, the London Regiment (Queen's Westminster and Civil Service Rifles), though veterans were determined to maintain the traditions of the old regiment. Members of the Civil Service companies of the successor regiment formed a <a href="guard%20of%20honour">guard of honour</a> during the ceremony. Prior to the memorial's unveiling, <a href="HM%20Treasury">HM Treasury</a> authorised the Office of Works to take responsibility for its maintenance.

The lines in the inscription relating to the cadet battalion were added in 1926 after Major Kirby wrote to the Office of Works seeking permission. The memorial suffered damage from <a href="The%20Blitz">German bombing</a> during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> and underwent repair and restoration work in the 1950s. As former members began to die, some due to wartime injuries, a tradition emerged of a widow laying the first wreath at the annual ceremony on <a href="Remembrance%20Sunday">Remembrance Sunday</a> (the closest Sunday to 11 November). Surviving members continued to meet at the war memorial until the late 1980s, by which time the attendees were in their nineties. 

By the early 1980s, few civil servants remained at Somerset House and the government was leasing parts of the building for other uses. When the matter was raised in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>, <a href="Douglas%20Houghton%2C%20Baron%20Houghton%20of%20Sowerby">Lord Houghton of Sowerby</a>—a former member of the regiment—enquired as to the government's plans for the war memorial. <a href="Roger%20Bootle-Wilbraham%2C%207th%20Baron%20Skelmersdale">Lord Skelmersdale</a> replied on behalf of the government: "This regiment had a distinguished record of service during the Great War and it is entirely fitting that the memorial should be situated in the courtyard of the first purpose-built government office building. I can assure the house there has been no thought of moving it, nor will there be". Nonetheless, the memorial was moved in the late 1990s, when the courtyard was redeveloped to provide a public exhibition space. It underwent restoration work, including repainting of the flags, before being reinstalled in front of the Navy Treasurer's door on the <a href="Victoria%20Embankment">Embankment</a> side of Somerset House, on a terrace beside the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>. The <a href="Royal%20Green%20Jackets">Royal Green Jackets</a> (the successor regiment resulting from further amalgamations following the Second World War and subsequent restructuring of the army) organised a rededication ceremony, which was held on 25 July 2002 and overseen by <a href="Richard%20Chartres">Richard Chartres</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>. The chairman of the board of the <a href="Inland%20Revenue">Inland Revenue</a>, which was based at Somerset House and whose officials were among the founding members of the Civil Service Rifles, laid a wreath. Among those present were relatives of former members, and Walter Humphrys, the last known surviving veteran of the regiment from the First World War. 

The memorial was designated a grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> in 1987. Listed status provides legal protection from demolition or modification; grade II is applied to about 92% of listed buildings of "special interest, warranting every effort to preserve them". It was upgraded to grade II* (reserved for "particularly important buildings of more than special interest" and applied to about 5.5% of listings) in November 2015, when Historic England deemed Lutyens' war memorials a national collection as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War.

Palmyra (; <a href="Palmyrene%20dialect">Palmyrene</a>: "Tadmor"; "Tadmur") is an ancient <a href="Semitic%20people">Semitic</a> city in present-day <a href="Homs%20Governorate">Homs Governorate</a>, <a href="Syria">Syria</a>. Archaeological finds date back to the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> period, and documents first mention the city in the early second millennium BC. Palmyra changed hands on a number of occasions between different empires before becoming a subject of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> in the first century AD.

The city grew wealthy from trade <a href="Caravan%20%28travellers%29">caravans</a>; the Palmyrenes became renowned as merchants who established colonies along the <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a> and operated throughout the Roman Empire. Palmyra's wealth enabled the construction of monumental projects, such as the <a href="Great%20Colonnade%20at%20Palmyra">Great Colonnade</a>, the <a href="Temple%20of%20Bel">Temple of Bel</a>, and the distinctive tower tombs. Ethnically, the Palmyrenes combined elements of <a href="Amorites">Amorites</a>, <a href="Arameans">Arameans</a>, and <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a>. The city's social structure was tribal, and its inhabitants spoke <a href="Palmyrene%20dialect">Palmyrene</a> (a dialect of <a href="Aramaic%20language">Aramaic</a>), while using <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> for commercial and diplomatic purposes. <a href="Greco-Roman%20world%23Culture">Greco-Roman culture</a> influenced the <a href="Culture%20of%20Syria">culture</a> of Palmyra, which produced distinctive art and architecture that combined eastern and western traditions. The city's inhabitants worshiped <a href="Canaanite%20religion">local Semitic deities</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Mesopotamian%20religion">Mesopotamian</a> and <a href="Arabian%20mythology">Arab gods</a>.

By the third century AD Palmyra had become a prosperous regional center. It reached the apex of its power in the 260s, when the Palmyrene King <a href="Odaenathus">Odaenathus</a> defeated <a href="Sasanian%20Empire">Persian</a> Emperor <a href="Shapur%20I">Shapur I</a>. The king was succeeded by <a href="regent">regent</a> Queen <a href="Zenobia">Zenobia</a>, who rebelled against Rome and established the <a href="Palmyrene%20Empire">Palmyrene Empire</a>. In 273, Roman emperor <a href="Aurelian">Aurelian</a> destroyed the city, which was later restored by <a href="Diocletian">Diocletian</a> at a reduced size. The Palmyrenes converted to <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> during the fourth century and to <a href="Islam">Islam</a> in the centuries following the conquest by the 7th-century <a href="Rashidun%20Caliphate">Rashidun Caliphate</a>, after which the Palmyrene and Greek languages were replaced by <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>.

Before AD 273, Palmyra enjoyed autonomy and was attached to the Roman <a href="Syria%20%28Roman%20province%29">province of Syria</a>, having its political organization influenced by the <a href="Polis">Greek city-state</a> model during the first two centuries AD. The city became a <a href="Colonia%20%28Roman%29">Roman colonia</a> during the third century, leading to the incorporation of Roman governing institutions, before becoming a monarchy in 260. Following its destruction in 273, Palmyra became a minor center under the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantines</a> and later empires. Its destruction by the <a href="Timurid%20Empire">Timurids</a> in 1400 reduced it to a small village. Under <a href="French%20Mandate%20of%20Syria">French Mandatory</a> rule in 1932, the inhabitants were moved into the new village of <a href="Tadmur">Tadmur</a>, and the ancient site became available for excavations. During the <a href="Syrian%20Civil%20War">Syrian Civil War</a> in 2015, the <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</a> (ISIL) destroyed large parts of the ancient city, which was recaptured by the <a href="Syrian%20Army">Syrian Army</a> on 2 March 2017.

The name "Tadmor" is known from the early second millennium BC; eighteenth century BC tablets from <a href="Mari%2C%20Syria">Mari</a> written in <a href="Cuneiform%20script">cuneiform</a> record the name as "Ta-ad-mi-ir", while Assyrian inscriptions of the eleventh century BC record it as Ta-ad-mar. Aramaic Palmyrene inscriptions themselves showed two variants of the name; "TDMR" (i.e. Tadmar) and "TDMWR" (i.e. Tadmor). The etymology of the name is unclear; the standard interpretation, supported by <a href="Albert%20Schultens">Albert Schultens</a>, connects it to the Semitic word for "<a href="Date%20palm%23Dates">date palm</a>", "tamar" (), thus referring to the palm trees that surrounded the city.

The Greek name (Latinized "Palmyra") is first recorded by <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> in the 1st century AD. It was used throughout the <a href="Greco-Roman">Greco-Roman</a> world. It is generally believed that "Palmyra" derives from "Tadmor" and two possibilities have been presented by linguists; one view holds that Palmyra was an alteration of Tadmor. According to the suggestion by Schultens, "Palmyra" could have arisen as a corruption of "Tadmor", via an unattested form "Talmura", changed to "Palmura" by influence of the Latin word "<a href="%3Awikt%3Apalma">palma</a>" (date "<a href="Arecaceae">palm</a>"), in reference to the city's palm trees, then the name reached its final form "Palmyra". The second view, supported by some philologists, such as <a href="Jean%20Starcky">Jean Starcky</a>, holds that Palmyra is a translation of "Tadmor" (assuming that it meant palm), which had derived from the Greek word for palm, ""Palame"".

An alternative suggestion connects the name to the <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac</a> "tedmurtā" (ܬܕܡܘܪܬܐ) "miracle", hence "tedmurtā" "object of wonder", from the root "dmr" "to wonder"; this possibility was mentioned favourably by <a href="Franz%20Altheim">Franz Altheim</a> and Ruth Altheim-Stiehl (1973), but rejected by Jean Starcky (1960) and Michael Gawlikowski (1974). <a href="Michael%20Patrick%20O%27Connor">Michael Patrick O'Connor</a> (1988) suggested that the names "Palmyra" and "Tadmor" originated in the <a href="Hurrian%20language">Hurrian language</a>. As evidence, he cited the inexplicability of alterations to the theorized roots of both names (represented in the addition of "-d-" to "tamar" and "-ra-" to "palame"). According to this theory, "Tadmor" derives from the Hurrian word "tad" ("to love") with the addition of the typical Hurrian <a href="mid%20vowel">mid vowel</a> rising (mVr) <a href="formant">formant</a> "mar". Similarly, according to this theory, "Palmyra" derives from the Hurrian word "pal" ("to know") using the same mVr formant ("mar").

Palmyra lies northeast of the Syrian capital, <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>, in an <a href="oasis">oasis</a> surrounded by <a href="Date%20palm">palms</a> (of which twenty varieties have been reported). Two mountain ranges overlook the city; the northern <a href="Aleppo%20plateau">Palmyrene mountain belt</a> from the north and the southern Palmyrene mountains from the southwest. In the south and the east Palmyra is exposed to the Syrian Desert. A small <a href="wadi">wadi</a> (<a href="al-Qubur">al-Qubur</a>) crosses the area, flowing from the western hills past the city before disappearing in the eastern gardens of the oasis. South of the wadi is a spring, <a href="Efqa">Efqa</a>. Pliny the Elder described the town in the 70s AD as famous for its desert location, the richness of its soil, and the springs surrounding it, which made agriculture and herding possible.

Palmyra began as a small settlement near the Efqa spring on the southern bank of Wadi al-Qubur. The settlement, known as the Hellenistic settlement, had residences expanding to the wadi's northern bank during the first century. Although the city's walls originally enclosed an extensive area on both banks of the wadi, the walls rebuilt during Aurelian's reign surrounded only the northern-bank section. Most of the city's monumental projects were built on the wadi's northern bank, among them is the <a href="Temple%20of%20Bel">Temple of Bel</a>, on a <a href="Tell%20%28archaeology%29">tell</a> which was the site of an earlier temple (known as the Hellenistic temple). However, excavation supports the theory that the tell was originally located on the southern bank, and the wadi was diverted south of the tell to incorporate the temple into Palmyra's late first and early second century urban organization on the north bank.

Also north of the wadi was the <a href="Great%20Colonnade%20at%20Palmyra">Great Colonnade</a>, Palmyra's main street, which extended from the Temple of Bel in the east, to the Funerary Temple no.86 in the city's western part. It had a <a href="Arch%20of%20Triumph%20%28Palmyra%29">monumental arch</a> in its eastern section, and a <a href="tetrapylon">tetrapylon</a> stands in the center. The Baths of Diocletian, built on the ruins of an earlier building which might have been the royal palace, were on the left side of the colonnade. Nearby were residences, the <a href="Temple%20of%20Baalshamin">Temple of Baalshamin</a>, and the Byzantine churches, which include "Basilica IV", Palmyra's largest church. The church is dated to the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire%20under%20the%20Justinian%20dynasty">Justinian age</a>, its columns are estimated to be high, and its base measured .

The Temple of <a href="Nabu">Nabu</a> and the <a href="Roman%20Theatre%20at%20Palmyra">Roman theater</a> were built on the colonnade's southern side. Behind the theater were a small senate building and the large Agora, with the remains of a "<a href="triclinium">triclinium</a>" (banquet room) and the Tariff Court. A cross street at the western end of the colonnade leads to the <a href="Camp%20of%20Diocletian">Camp of Diocletian</a>, built by Sosianus Hierocles (the Roman governor of Syria). Nearby are the <a href="Temple%20of%20Al-Lat">Temple of Al-lāt</a> and the Damascus Gate.

At its height during the reign of Zenobia, Palmyra had more than 200,000 residents. Its earliest known inhabitants were the <a href="Amorites">Amorites</a> in the early second millennium BC, and by the end of the millennium <a href="Arameans">Arameans</a> were mentioned as inhabiting the area. <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a> arrived in the city in the late first millennium BC. <a href="Sheikh">Sheikh</a> <a href="Zabdibel">Zabdibel</a>, who aided the Seleucids in the battle of Raphia (217 BC), was mentioned as the commander of "the arabs and neighbouring tribes to the number of ten thousands"; Zabdibel and his men were not actually identified as Palmyrenes in the texts, but the name "Zabdibel" is a Palmyrene name leading to the conclusion that the sheikh hailed from Palmyra. The Arab newcomers were assimilated by the earlier inhabitants, used Palmyrene as a mother tongue, and formed a significant segment of the aristocracy.
The city also had a Jewish community; inscriptions in Palmyrene from the necropolis of <a href="Beit%20She%27arim%20National%20Park">Beit She'arim</a> in <a href="Lower%20Galilee">Lower Galilee</a> confirm the burial of Palmyrene Jews. Occasionally and rarely, members of the Palmyrene families took Greek names while ethnic Greeks were few; the majority of people with Greek names, who did not belong to one of the city's families, were freed slaves. The Palmyrenes seem to have disliked the Greeks, considered them foreigners, and restricted their settlement in the city.
Until the late third century AD, Palmyrenes spoke a <a href="Palmyrene%20dialect">dialect</a> of <a href="Aramaic%20language">Aramaic</a> and used the <a href="Palmyrene%20alphabet">Palmyrene alphabet</a>. The use of <a href="Latin">Latin</a> was minimal, but Greek was used by wealthier members of society for commercial and diplomatic purposes, and it became the dominant language during the Byzantine era. After the Arab conquest, Greek was replaced by <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>, from which a Palmyrene dialect evolved.

Palmyra's society was a mixture of the different peoples inhabiting the city, which is seen in Aramaic, Arabic and Amorite clan names. Palmyra was a tribal community but due to the lack of sources, an understanding of the nature of Palmyrene tribal structure is not possible. Thirty clans have been documented; five of which were identified as tribes (<a href="Phyle">Phyle (φυλή)</a>) comprising several sub-clans. By the time of <a href="Nero">Nero</a> Palmyra had four tribes, each residing in an area of the city bearing its name. Three of the tribes were the <a href="Bene%20Komare">Komare</a>, Mattabol and <a href="Bene%20Ma%27zin">Ma'zin</a>; the fourth tribe is uncertain, but was probably the Mita. In time, the four tribes became highly civic and tribal lines blurred; by the second century clan identity lost its importance, and it disappeared during the third century. Even the four tribes ceased to be important by the third century as only one inscription mentions a tribe after the year 212; instead, aristocrats played the decisive role in the city's social organization. During the <a href="Umayyad">Umayyad</a> period Palmyra was mainly inhabited by the Kalb tribe. <a href="Benjamin%20of%20Tudela">Benjamin of Tudela</a> recorded the existence of 2,000 Jews in the city during the twelfth century. Palmyra declined after its destruction by Timur in 1400, and was a village of 6,000 inhabitants at the beginning of the 20th century; although surrounded by Bedouin, the villagers preserved their dialect. Palmyra maintained the life of a small settlement until its relocation in 1932.

The scarce artifacts found in the city dating to the Bronze Age reveal that, culturally, Palmyra was most affiliated with western Syria. <a href="Classical%20antiquity">Classical</a> Palmyra had a distinctive culture, based on a <a href="Culture%20of%20Syria">local Semitic</a> tradition, and influenced by Greece and Rome. To appear better integrated into the Roman Empire, some Palmyrenes adopted Greco-Roman names, either alone or in addition to a second native name. The extent of Greek influence on Palmyra's culture is debated. Scholars interpreted the Palmyrenes' Greek practices differently; many see those characters as a superficial layer over a local essence. Palmyra's senate was an example; although Palmyrene texts written in Greek described it as a "<a href="Boule%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">boule</a>" (a Greek institution), the senate was a gathering of non-elected tribal elders (a Near-Eastern assembly tradition). Others view Palmyra's culture as a fusion of local and Greco-Roman traditions.

The culture of <a href="Culture%20of%20Iran">Persia</a> influenced Palmyrene military tactics, dress and court ceremonies. Palmyra had no large libraries or publishing facilities, and it lacked an intellectual movement characteristic of other Eastern cities such as <a href="Edessa">Edessa</a> or Antioch. Although Zenobia opened her court to academics, the only notable scholar documented was <a href="Cassius%20Longinus%20%28philosopher%29">Cassius Longinus</a>.

Palmyra had a large <a href="agora">agora</a>. However, unlike the Greek Agoras (public gathering places shared with public buildings), Palmyra's agora resembled an Eastern <a href="caravanserai">caravanserai</a> more than a hub of public life. The Palmyrenes buried their dead in elaborate family mausoleums, most with interior walls forming rows of burial chambers (<a href="Loculus%20%28architecture%29">loculi</a>) in which the dead, laying at full length, were placed. A <a href="relief">relief</a> of the person interred formed part of the wall's decoration, acting as a headstone. <a href="Sarcophagi">Sarcophagi</a> appeared in the late second century and were used in some of the tombs. Many burial monuments contained <a href="Mummy">mummies</a> embalmed in a method similar to that used in <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20burial%20customs%23Mummification">Ancient Egypt</a>.

Although Palmyrene art was related to <a href="Hellenistic%20art">that of Greece</a>, it had a distinctive style unique to the middle-Euphrates region. Palmyrene art is well represented by the <a href="Palmyrene%20funerary%20reliefs">bust reliefs</a> which seal the openings of its burial chambers. The reliefs emphasized clothing, jewelry and a frontal representation of the person depicted, characteristics which can be seen as a forerunner of <a href="Byzantine%20art">Byzantine art</a>. According to <a href="Michael%20Rostovtzeff">Michael Rostovtzeff</a>, Palmyra's art was influenced by <a href="Parthian%20art">Parthian art</a>. However, the origin of frontality that characterized Palmyrene and Parthian arts is a controversial issue; while Parthian origin has been suggested (by <a href="Daniel%20Schlumberger">Daniel Schlumberger</a>), <a href="Michael%20Avi-Yonah">Michael Avi-Yonah</a> contends that it was a local Syrian tradition that influenced Parthian art. Little painting, and none of the bronze statues of prominent citizens (which stood on brackets on the main columns of the Great Colonnade), have survived. A damaged <a href="frieze">frieze</a> and other sculptures from the Temple of Bel, many removed to museums in Syria and abroad, suggest the city's public monumental sculpture.

Many surviving funerary busts reached Western museums during the 19th century. Palmyra provided the most convenient Eastern examples bolstering an art-history controversy at the turn of the 20th century: to what extent Eastern influence on <a href="Roman%20art">Roman art</a> replaced idealized classicism with frontal, hieratic and simplified figures (as believed by <a href="Josef%20Strzygowski">Josef Strzygowski</a> and others). This transition is seen as a response to cultural changes in the <a href="Western%20Roman%20Empire">Western Roman Empire</a>, rather than artistic influence from the East. Palmyrene bust reliefs, unlike Roman sculptures, are rudimentary portraits; although many reflect high quality individuality, the majority vary little across figures of similar age and gender.

Like its art, Palmyra's architecture was influenced by the Greco-Roman style, while preserving local elements (best seen in the Temple of Bel). Enclosed by a massive wall flanked with traditional Roman columns, Bel's sanctuary plan was primarily Semitic. Similar to the <a href="Second%20Temple">Second Temple</a>, the sanctuary consisted of a large courtyard with the deity's main shrine off-center against its entrance (a plan preserving elements of the temples of <a href="Ebla">Ebla</a> and <a href="Ugarit">Ugarit</a>).

West of the ancient walls, the Palmyrenes built a number of large-scale funerary monuments which now form the Valley of Tombs, a <a href="necropolis">necropolis</a>. The more than 50 monuments were primarily tower-shaped and up to four stories high. Towers were replaced by funerary temples in the first half of the second century AD, as the most recent tower is dated to AD 128. The city had other cemeteries in the north, southwest and southeast, where the tombs are primarily <a href="Hypogeum">hypogea</a> (underground).




According to eyewitnesses, on 23 May 2015 <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">ISIL</a> militants destroyed the <a href="Lion%20of%20Al-l%C4%81t">Lion of Al-lāt</a> and other statues; this came days after the militants had gathered the citizens and promised not to destroy the city's monuments. ISIL destroyed the Temple of Baalshamin on 23 August 2015 according to Syria's antiquities chief Maamoun Abdulkarim and activists. On 30 August 2015, ISIL destroyed the cella of the Temple of Bel. On 31 August 2015, the United Nations confirmed the temple was <a href="Temple%20of%20Bel%23Destruction">destroyed</a>; the temple's exterior walls and entrance arch remain.

It became known on 4 September 2015 that ISIL had destroyed three of the best preserved tower tombs including the <a href="Tower%20of%20Elahbel">Tower of Elahbel</a>. On 5 October 2015, news media reported that ISIL was destroying buildings with no religious meaning, including the monumental arch. On 20 January 2017, news emerged that the militants had destroyed the tetrapylon and part of the theater. Following the March 2017 capture of Palmyra by the Syrian Army, Maamoun Abdulkarim, director of antiquities and museums at the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Culture%20%28Syria%29">Syrian Ministry of Culture</a>, stated that the damage to ancient monuments may be lesser than earlier believed and preliminary pictures showed almost no further damage than what was already known. Antiquities official Wael Hafyan stated that the Tetrapylon was badly damaged while the damage to the facade of the Roman theatre was less serious.

In response to the destruction, on 21 October 2015, <a href="Creative%20Commons">Creative Commons</a> started the New Palmyra project, an online repository of three-dimensional models representing the city's monuments; the models were generated from images gathered, and released into the public domain, by the Syrian internet advocate <a href="Bassel%20Khartabil">Bassel Khartabil</a> between 2005 and 2012. Consultations with the UNESCO, UN specialized agencies, archaeological associations and museums produced plans to restore Palmyra; the work is postponed until the violence in Syria ends as many international partners fear for the safety of their teams as well as ensuring that the restored artifacts will not be damaged again by further battles. Minor restorations took place; two Palmyrene funerary busts, damaged and defaced by ISIL, were sent off to Rome where they were restored and sent back to Syria. The restoration of the Lion of Al-lāt took two months and the statue was displayed on 1 October 2017; it will remain in the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Damascus">National Museum of Damascus</a>.

Regarding the restoration, the discoverer of Ebla, <a href="Paolo%20Matthiae">Paolo Matthiae</a>, stated that: "The archaeological site of Palmyra is a vast field of ruins and only 20-30% of it is seriously damaged. Unfortunately these included important parts, such as the Temple of Bel, while the Arc of Triumph can be rebuilt." He added: "In any case, by using both traditional methods and advanced technologies, it might be possible to restore 98% of the site". According to the governor of Homs' province Talal Barazi, restoration to damaged parts of the city is underway, with the ancient city ready to receive tourists in summer 2019.

The site at Palmyra provided evidence for a <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> settlement near Efqa, with <a href="Stone%20tool%23Neolithic%20industries">stone tools</a> dated to 7500 BC. <a href="Stratigraphy">Archaeological sounding</a> in the tell beneath the Temple of Bel uncovered a mud-brick structure built around 2500 BC, followed by structures built during the Middle Bronze Age and Iron Age.

The city entered the historical record during the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> around 2000 BC, when Puzur-Ishtar the Tadmorean (Palmyrene) agreed to a contract at an <a href="Assyria%23Dynasty%20of%20Puzur-Ashur%20I.2C%202025.E2.80.931809%20BC.2C%20Old%20Assyrian%20Empire">Assyrian</a> trading colony in <a href="Kultepe">Kultepe</a>. It was mentioned next in the <a href="Mari%2C%20Syria%23Mari%20tablets">Mari tablets</a> as a stop for trade caravans and nomadic tribes, such as the <a href="Suteans">Suteans</a>, and was conquered along with its region by <a href="Yahdun-Lim">Yahdun-Lim</a> of Mari. King <a href="Shamshi-Adad%20I">Shamshi-Adad I</a> of Assyria passed through the area on his way to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> at the beginning of the 18th century BC; by then, Palmyra was the easternmost point of the kingdom of <a href="Qatna">Qatna</a>, and it was attacked by the Suteans who paralyzed the traffic along the trade routes. Palmyra was mentioned in a 13th-century BC tablet discovered at <a href="Emar">Emar</a>, which recorded the names of two "Tadmorean" witnesses. At the beginning of the 11th century BC, King <a href="Tiglath-Pileser%20I">Tiglath-Pileser I</a> of Assyria recorded his defeat of the "Arameans" of "Tadmar"; according to the king, Palmyra was part of the land of <a href="Amurru%20kingdom">Amurru</a>. The city became the eastern border of <a href="Aram-Damascus">Aram-Damascus</a> which was conquered by the <a href="Neo-Assyrian%20Empire">Neo-Assyrian Empire</a> in 732 BC.

The Hebrew Bible (<a href="Books%20of%20Chronicles">Second Book of Chronicles</a> 8:4) records a city by the name "Tadmor" as a desert city built (or fortified) by King <a href="Solomon">Solomon</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28united%20monarchy%29">Israel</a>; Flavius <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a> mentions the Greek name "Palmyra", attributing its founding to Solomon in Book VIII of his "<a href="Antiquities%20of%20the%20Jews">Antiquities of the Jews</a>". Later Arabic traditions attribute the city's founding to Solomon's <a href="Jinn%23Solomon%20and%20the%20Jinn">Jinn</a>. The association of Palmyra with Solomon is a conflation of "Tadmor" and a city built by Solomon in <a href="Judea">Judea</a> and known as "Tamar" in the <a href="Books%20of%20Kings">Books of Kings</a> (1 Kings 9:18). The biblical description of "Tadmor" and its buildings does not fit archaeological findings in Palmyra, which was a small settlement during Solomon's reign in the 10th century BC.

During the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic period</a> under the <a href="Seleucids">Seleucids</a> (between 312 and 64 BC), Palmyra became a prosperous settlement owing allegiance to the Seleucid king. Evidence for Palmyra's urbanisation in the Hellenistic period is rare; an important piece is the <a href="Aramaic%20Inscription%20of%20Laghman">Laghman II</a> inscription found in <a href="Laghman%20Province">Laghman</a>, modern <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, and commissioned by the Indian emperor <a href="Ashoka">Ashoka</a> c. 250 BC. The reading is contested, but according to semitologist <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Dupont-Sommer">André Dupont-Sommer</a>, the inscription records the distance to "Tdmr" (Palmyra). In 217 BC, a Palmyrene force led by Zabdibel joined the army of King <a href="Antiochus%20III">Antiochus III</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Raphia">Battle of Raphia</a> which ended in a Seleucid defeat by <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic Egypt</a>. In the middle of the Hellenistic era, Palmyra, formerly south of the al-Qubur wadi, began to expand beyond its northern bank. By the late second century BC, the tower tombs in the Palmyrene Valley of Tombs and the city temples (most notably, the temples of <a href="Baalshamin">Baalshamin</a>, Al-lāt and the Hellenistic temple) began to be built. A fragmentary inscription in Greek from the Temple of Bel's foundations mentions a king titled Epiphanes, a title used by the Seleucid kings.

In 64 BC the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a> conquered the Seleucid kingdom, and the Roman general <a href="Pompey">Pompey</a> established the <a href="Syria%20%28Roman%20province%29">province of Syria</a>. Palmyra was left independent, trading with Rome and <a href="Parthian%20empire">Parthia</a> but belonging to neither. The earliest known inscription in Palmyrene is dated to around 44 BC; Palmyra was still a minor <a href="sheikhdom">sheikhdom</a>, offering water to caravans which occasionally took the desert route on which it was located. However, according to <a href="Appian">Appian</a> Palmyra was wealthy enough for <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a> to send a force to conquer it in 41 BC. The Palmyrenes evacuated to Parthian lands beyond the eastern bank of the <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>, which they prepared to defend.

Palmyra became part of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> when it was conquered and paid tribute early in the reign of <a href="Tiberius">Tiberius</a>, around 14 AD. The Romans included Palmyra in the province of Syria, and defined the region's boundaries; a boundary marker laid by Roman governor <a href="Quintus%20Caecilius%20Metellus%20Creticus%20Silanus">Silanus</a> was found northwest of the city at <a href="Khirbet%20el-Bilaas">Khirbet el-Bilaas</a>. A marker at the city's southwestern border was found at <a href="Qasr%20al-Hayr%20al-Gharbi">Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi</a>, and its eastern border extended to the Euphrates valley. This region included numerous villages subordinate to the center such as <a href="al-Qaryatayn">al-Qaryatayn</a> (35 other settlements have been identified by 2012). The Roman imperial period brought great prosperity to the city, which enjoyed a privileged status under the empire—retaining much of its internal autonomy, being ruled by a council, and incorporating many Greek city-state (<a href="polis">polis</a>) institutions into its government.

The earliest Palmyrene text attesting a Roman presence in the city dates to 18 AD, when the Roman general <a href="Germanicus">Germanicus</a> tried to develop a friendly relationship with Parthia; he sent the Palmyrene Alexandros to <a href="Characene">Mesene</a>, a Parthian vassal kingdom. This was followed by the arrival of the Roman legion <a href="Legio%20X%20Fretensis">Legio X Fretensis</a> the following year. Roman authority was minimal during the first century AD, although tax collectors were resident, and a road connecting Palmyra and <a href="Sura%2C%20Syria">Sura</a> was built in AD 75. The Romans used Palmyrene soldiers, but (unlike typical Roman cities) no local <a href="Roman%20magistrate">magistrates</a> or <a href="Prefect%23Ancient%20Rome">prefects</a> are recorded in the city. Palmyra saw intensive construction during the first century, including the city's first walled fortifications, and the Temple of Bel (completed and dedicated in 32 AD). During the first century Palmyra developed from a minor desert caravan station into a leading trading center, with Palmyrene merchants establishing colonies in surrounding trade centers.

Palmyrene trade reached its acme during the second century, aided by two factors; the first was a trade route built by Palmyrenes, and protected by garrisons at major locations, including a garrison in <a href="Dura-Europos">Dura-Europos</a> manned in 117 AD. The second was the <a href="Arabia%20Petraea%23Roman%20conquest">Roman conquest</a> of the <a href="Nabataean%20kingdom">Nabataean</a> capital <a href="Petra">Petra</a> in 106, shifting control over southern trade routes of the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a> from the Nabataeans to Palmyra. In 129 Palmyra was visited by <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a>, who named it "Hadriane Palmyra" and made it a <a href="Free%20city%20%28antiquity%29">free city</a>. Hadrian promoted <a href="Hellenization">Hellenism</a> throughout the empire, and Palmyra's urban expansion was modeled on that of Greece. This led to new projects, including the theatre, the colonnade and the Temple of Nabu. Roman garrisons are first attested in Palmyra in 167, when the cavalry <a href="Auxilia%23Alae">Ala I Thracum Herculiana</a> was moved to the city. By the end of the second century, urban development diminished after the city's building projects peaked.

In the 190s, Palmyra was assigned to the province of <a href="Phoenice%20%28Roman%20province%29">Phoenice</a>, newly created by the <a href="Severan%20dynasty">Severan dynasty</a>. Toward the end of the second century, Palmyra began a steady transition from a traditional Greek city-state to a monarchy due to the increasing militarization of the city and the deteriorating economic situation; the Severan ascension to the imperial throne in Rome played a major role in Palmyra's transition:

The rise of the <a href="Sasanian%20Empire">Sasanian Empire</a> in Persia considerably damaged Palmyrene trade. The Sasanians disbanded Palmyrene colonies in their lands, and began a war against the Roman empire. In an inscription dated to 252 <a href="Odaenathus">Odaenathus</a> appears bearing the title of <a href="exarch">exarch</a>os (lord) of Palmyra. The weakness of the Roman empire and the constant Persian danger were probably the reasons behind the Palmyrene council's decision to elect a lord for the city in order for him to lead a strengthened army. Odaenathus approached <a href="Shapur%20I">Shapur I</a> of Persia to request him to guarantee Palmyrene interests in Persia, but was rebuffed. In 260 the Emperor <a href="Valerian%20%28emperor%29">Valerian</a> fought Shapur at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Edessa">Battle of Edessa</a>, but was defeated and captured. One of Valerian's officers, <a href="Macrianus%20Major">Macrianus Major</a>, his sons <a href="Quietus">Quietus</a> and <a href="Macrianus%20Minor">Macrianus</a>, and the <a href="Praetorian%20prefect">prefect</a> <a href="Balista">Balista</a> rebelled against Valerian's son <a href="Gallienus">Gallienus</a>, usurping imperial power in Syria.

Odaenathus formed an army of Palmyrenes and Syrian peasants against Shapur. According to the "<a href="Augustan%20History">Augustan History</a>", Odaenathus declared himself king prior to the battle. The Palmyrene leader won a decisive victory near the banks of the Euphrates later in 260 forcing the Persians to retreat. In 261 Odaenathus marched against the remaining usurpers in Syria, defeating and killing Quietus and Balista. As a reward, he received the title "Imperator Totius Orientis" ("Governor of the East") from Gallienus, and ruled Syria, <a href="Mesopotamia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Mesopotamia</a>, <a href="Arabia%20Petraea">Arabia</a> and <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>'s eastern regions as the imperial representative. Palmyra itself remained officially part of the empire but Palmyrene inscriptions started to describe it as a "metrocolonia", indicating that the city's status was higher than normal Roman colonias. In practice, Palmyra shifted from a provincial city to a de facto allied kingdom.

In 262 Odaenathus launched a new campaign against Shapur, reclaiming the rest of Roman Mesopotamia (most importantly, the cities of <a href="Nisibis">Nisibis</a> and <a href="Carrhae">Carrhae</a>), sacking the Jewish city of <a href="Nehardea">Nehardea</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Ctesiphon%20%28263%29">besieging</a> the Persian capital <a href="Ctesiphon">Ctesiphon</a>. Following his victory, the Palmyrene monarch assumed the title <a href="King%20of%20Kings">King of Kings</a>. Later, Odaenathus crowned his son <a href="Hairan%20I">Hairan I</a> as co-King of Kings near Antioch in 263. Although he did not take the Persian capital, Odaenathus drove the Persians out of all Roman lands conquered since the beginning of Shapur's <a href="Siege%20of%20Nisibis%20%28252%29">wars in 252</a>. In a second campaign that took place in 266, the Palmyrene king reached Ctesiphon again; however, he had to leave the siege and move north, accompanied by Hairan I, to repel <a href="Asia%20%28Roman%20province%29%23Decline">Gothic attacks</a> on <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>. The king and his son were assassinated during their return in 267; according to the "Augustan History" and <a href="Joannes%20Zonaras">Joannes Zonaras</a>, Odaenathus was killed by a cousin (Zonaras says nephew) named in the "History" as <a href="Maeonius">Maeonius</a>. The "Augustan History" also says that Maeonius was proclaimed emperor for a brief period before being killed by the soldiers. However, no inscriptions or other evidence exist for Maeonius' reign.

Odaenathus was succeeded by his son; the ten-year-old <a href="Vaballathus">Vaballathus</a>. <a href="Zenobia">Zenobia</a>, the mother of the new king, was the "de facto" ruler and Vaballathus remained in her shadow while she consolidated her power. Gallienus dispatched his prefect <a href="Aurelius%20Heraclianus">Heraclian</a> to command military operations against the Persians, but he was marginalized by Zenobia and returned to the West. The queen was careful not to provoke Rome, claiming for herself and her son the titles held by her husband while guaranteeing the safety of the borders with Persia and pacifying the <a href="Tanukhids">Tanukhids</a> in <a href="Hauran">Hauran</a>. To protect the borders with Persia, Zenobia fortified different settlements on the Euphrates including the citadels of <a href="Halabiye">Halabiye</a> and <a href="Zalabiye">Zalabiye</a>. Circumstantial evidence exist for confrontations with the Sasanians; probably in 269 Vaballathus took the title "Persicus Maximus" ("The great victor in Persia") and the title might be linked with an unrecorded battle against a Persian army trying to regain control of Northern Mesopotamia.

Zenobia began her military career in the spring of 270, during the reign of <a href="Claudius%20Gothicus">Claudius Gothicus</a>. Under the pretext of attacking the Tanukhids, she conquered Roman Arabia. This was followed in October by an <a href="Palmyrene%20invasion%20of%20Egypt">invasion of Egypt</a>, ending with a Palmyrene victory and Zenobia's proclamation as queen of Egypt. Palmyra invaded Anatolia the following year, reaching <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a> and the pinnacle of its expansion. The conquests were made behind a mask of subordination to Rome. Zenobia issued coins in the name of Claudius' successor <a href="Aurelian">Aurelian</a>, with Vaballathus depicted as king; since Aurelian was occupied with repelling insurgencies in Europe, he tolerated the Palmyrene coinage and encroachments. In late 271, Vaballathus and his mother assumed the titles of <a href="Augustus%20%28honorific%29">Augustus</a> (emperor) and <a href="List%20of%20Augustae">Augusta</a>.

The following year, Aurelian crossed the <a href="Bosphorus">Bosphorus</a> and advanced quickly through Anatolia. According to one account, Roman general <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius%20Probus">Marcus Aurelius Probus</a> regained Egypt from Palmyra; Aurelian entered <a href="Issus%20%28town%29">Issus</a> and headed to <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>, where he defeated Zenobia in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Immae">Battle of Immae</a>. Zenobia was defeated again at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Emesa">Battle of Emesa</a>, taking refuge in <a href="Homs">Homs</a> before quickly returning to her capital. When the Romans besieged Palmyra, Zenobia refused their order to surrender in person to the emperor. She escaped east to ask the Persians for help, but was captured by the Romans; the city capitulated soon afterwards.

Aurelian spared the city and stationed a garrison of 600 archers, led by <a href="Sandarion">Sandarion</a>, as a peacekeeping force. In 273 Palmyra rebelled under the leadership of <a href="Septimius%20Apsaios">Septimius Apsaios</a>, declaring <a href="Septimius%20Antiochus">Antiochus</a> (a relative of Zenobia) as Augustus. Aurelian marched against Palmyra, razing it to the ground and seizing the most valuable monuments to decorate his <a href="Sol%20Invictus%23Aurelian">Temple of Sol</a>. Palmyrene buildings were smashed, residents massacred and the Temple of Bel pillaged.

Palmyra was reduced to a village and it largely disappeared from historical records of that period. Aurelian repaired the Temple of Bel, and the <a href="List%20of%20Roman%20legions%23Late%20Empire%20legions">Legio I Illyricorum</a> was stationed in the city. Shortly before 303 the Camp of Diocletian, a "<a href="castra">castra</a>" in the western part of the city, was built. The camp was a base for the Legio I Illyricorum, which guarded the trade routes around the city. Palmyra became a Christian city in the decades following its destruction by Aurelian. In late 527, <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian I</a> ordered the restoration of Palmyra's churches and public buildings to protect the empire against raids by <a href="Lakhmids">Lakhmid</a> king <a href="Al-Mundhir%20III%20ibn%20al-Nu%27man">Al-Mundhir III ibn al-Nu'man</a>.

Palmyra was conquered by the <a href="Rashidun%20Caliphate">Rashidun Caliphate</a> after its 634 capture by the <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> general <a href="Khalid%20ibn%20al-Walid">Khalid ibn al-Walid</a>, who took the city on his way to Damascus; an 18-day march by his <a href="Rashidun%20army">army</a> through the Syrian Desert from Mesopotamia. By then Palmyra was limited to the Diocletian camp. After the conquest, the city became part of <a href="Jund%20Hims">Homs Province</a>.

Palmyra prospered as part of the Umayyad Caliphate, and its population grew. It was a key stop on the East-West trade route, with a large "<a href="souq">souq</a>" (market), built by the Umayyads, who also commissioned part of the Temple of Bel as a <a href="Jama%20Masjid">mosque</a>. During this period, Palmyra was a stronghold of the <a href="Banu%20Kalb">Banu Kalb</a> tribe. After being defeated by <a href="Marwan%20II">Marwan II</a> during a <a href="Third%20Muslim%20Civil%20War">civil war in the caliphate</a>, Umayyad contender <a href="Sulayman%20ibn%20Hisham">Sulayman ibn Hisham</a> fled to the Banu Kalb in Palmyra, but eventually pledged allegiance to Marwan in 744; Palmyra continued to oppose Marwan until the surrender of the Banu Kalb leader al-Abrash al-Kalbi in 745. That year, Marwan ordered the city's walls demolished.

In 750 a revolt, led by <a href="Abu%20al-Ward">Majza'a ibn al-Kawthar</a> and Umayyad pretender <a href="Abu%20Muhammad%20al-Sufyani">Abu Muhammad al-Sufyani</a>, against the new <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid Caliphate</a> swept across Syria; the tribes in Palmyra supported the rebels. After his defeat Abu Muhammad took refuge in the city, which withstood an Abbasid assault long enough to allow him to escape.

Abbasid power dwindled during the 10th century, when the empire disintegrated and was divided among a number of vassals. Most of the new rulers acknowledged the caliph as their nominal sovereign, a situation which continued until the <a href="Siege%20of%20Baghdad%20%281258%29">Mongol destruction</a> of the Abbasid Caliphate in 1258.

In 955 <a href="Sayf%20al-Dawla">Sayf al-Dawla</a>, the <a href="Hamdanid%20dynasty">Hamdanid</a> prince of <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a>, defeated the nomads near the city, and built a <a href="kasbah">kasbah</a> (fortress) in response to <a href="Arab%E2%80%93Byzantine%20wars%23Byzantine%20resurgence.2C%20863.E2.80.9311th%20century">campaigns</a> by the Byzantine emperors <a href="Nikephoros%20II%20Phokas">Nikephoros II Phokas</a> and <a href="John%20I%20Tzimiskes">John I Tzimiskes</a>. After the early-11th-century Hamdanid collapse, the region of Homs was controlled by the successor <a href="Mirdasid%20dynasty">Mirdasid dynasty</a>. Earthquakes devastated Palmyra in 1068 and 1089. In the 1070s Syria was conquered by the <a href="Seljuk%20Empire">Seljuk Empire</a>, and in 1082, the district of Homs came under the control of the Arab lord <a href="Khalaf%20ibn%20Mula%27ib">Khalaf ibn Mula'ib</a>. The latter was a brigand and was removed and imprisoned in 1090 by the Seljuq sultan <a href="Malik-Shah%20I">Malik-Shah I</a>. Khalaf's lands were given to Malik-Shah's brother, <a href="Tutush%20I">Tutush I</a>, who gained his independence after his brother's 1092 death and established a <a href="List%20of%20Seljuk%20rulers%20in%20Syria%20%281076%E2%80%931117%29">cadet branch</a> of the Seljuk dynasty in Syria.
During the early 12th century Palmyra was ruled by <a href="Toghtekin">Toghtekin</a>, the <a href="Burid%20dynasty">Burid</a> <a href="atabeg">atabeg</a> of Damascus, who appointed his nephew governor. Toghtekin's nephew was killed by rebels, and the atabeg retook the city in 1126. Palmyra was given to Toghtekin's grandson, <a href="Shihab-ud-din%20Mahmud">Shihab-ud-din Mahmud</a>, who was replaced by governor <a href="Yusuf%20ibn%20Firuz">Yusuf ibn Firuz</a> when Shihab-ud-din Mahmud returned to Damascus after his father <a href="Taj%20al-Muluk%20Buri">Taj al-Muluk Buri</a> succeeded Toghtekin. The Burids transformed the Temple of Bel into a citadel in 1132, fortifying the city, and transferring it to the <a href="Bin%20Qaraja">Bin Qaraja</a> family three years later in exchange for Homs.

During the mid-12th century, Palmyra was ruled by the <a href="Zengid%20dynasty">Zengid</a> king <a href="Nur%20ad-Din%2C%20atabeg%20of%20Aleppo">Nur ad-Din Mahmud</a>. It became part of the district of Homs, which was given as a fiefdom to the Ayyubid general <a href="Shirkuh">Shirkuh</a> in 1168 and confiscated after his death in 1169. Homs region was conquered by the <a href="Ayyubid%20dynasty">Ayyubid sultanate</a> in 1174; the following year, <a href="Saladin">Saladin</a> gave Homs (including Palmyra) to his cousin <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20Shirkuh">Nasir al-Din Muhammad</a> as a fiefdom. After Saladin's death, the Ayyubid realm was divided and Palmyra was given to Nasir al-Din Muhammad's son <a href="Al-Mujahid">Al-Mujahid Shirkuh II</a> (who built the castle of Palmyra known as <a href="Fakhr-al-Din%20al-Maani%20Castle">Fakhr-al-Din al-Maani Castle</a> around 1230). Five years earlier, Syrian geographer <a href="Yaqut%20al-Hamawi">Yaqut al-Hamawi</a> described Palmyra's residents as living in "a castle surrounded by a stone wall".

Palmyra was used as a refuge by Shirkuh II's grandson, <a href="Al-Ashraf%20Musa%2C%20Emir%20of%20Homs">al-Ashraf Musa</a>, who allied himself with the <a href="Mongol%20Empire">Mongol</a> king <a href="Hulagu%20Khan">Hulagu Khan</a> and fled after the Mongol defeat in the 1260 <a href="Battle%20of%20Ain%20Jalut">Battle of Ain Jalut</a> against the <a href="Mamluk%20Sultanate%20%28Cairo%29">Mamluks</a>. Al-Ashraf Musa asked the Mamluk sultan <a href="Qutuz">Qutuz</a> for pardon and was accepted as a vassal. Al-Ashraf Musa died in 1263 without an heir, bringing the Homs district under direct Mamluk rule.

The <a href="Al%20Fadl">Al Fadl</a> clan (a branch of the <a href="Tayy">Tayy</a> tribe) were loyal to the Mamluks, and in 1281, Prince <a href="Isa%20ibn%20Muhanna">Issa bin Muhanna</a> of the Al Fadl was appointed lord of Palmyra by sultan <a href="Al%20Mansur%20Qalawun">Qalawun</a>. Issa was succeeded in 1284 by his son <a href="Muhanna%20ibn%20Isa">Muhanna bin Issa</a> who was imprisoned by sultan <a href="al-Ashraf%20Khalil">al-Ashraf Khalil</a> in 1293, and restored two years later by sultan <a href="al-Adil%20Kitbugha">al-Adil Kitbugha</a>. Muhanna declared his loyalty to <a href="%C3%96ljait%C3%BC">Öljaitü</a> of the <a href="Ilkhanate">Ilkhanate</a> in 1312 and was dismissed and replaced with his brother <a href="Fadl%20ibn%20Isa">Fadl</a> by sultan <a href="an-Nasir%20Muhammad">an-Nasir Muhammad</a>. Although Muhanna was forgiven by an-Nasir and restored in 1317, he and his tribe were expelled in 1320 for his continued relations with the Ilkhanate, and he was replaced by tribal chief <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20Abi%20Bakr%20%28chief%29">Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr</a>.

Muhanna was forgiven and restored by an-Nasir in 1330; he remained loyal to the sultan until his death in 1335, when he was succeeded by his son. Contemporary historian <a href="Shihab%20al-Umari">Ibn Fadlallah al-Omari</a> described the city as having "vast gardens, flourishing trades and bizarre monuments". The Al Fadl clan protected the trade routes and villages from <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> raids, raiding other cities and fighting among themselves. The Mamluks intervened militarily several times, dismissing, imprisoning or expelling its leaders. In 1400 Palmyra was attacked by <a href="Timur">Timur</a>; the Fadl prince <a href="Muhammad%20bin%20Hayyar">Nu'air</a> escaped the battle and later fought <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Aleppo%23Mamluks">Jakam</a>, the sultan of Aleppo. Nu'air was captured, taken to Aleppo and executed in 1406; this, according to <a href="Ibn%20Hajar%20al-Asqalani">Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani</a>, ended the Al Fadl clan's power.

Syria became part of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> in 1516, and Palmyra was a center of an administrative district (<a href="sanjak">sanjak</a>). During the Ottoman era, Palmyra was a small village in the courtyard of the Temple of Bel. After 1568 the Ottomans appointed the <a href="Lebanese%20people">Lebanese</a> prince <a href="Harfush%20clan">Ali bin Musa Harfush</a> as governor of Palmyra's sanjak, dismissing him in 1584 for treason. In 1630 Palmyra came under the authority of another Lebanese prince, <a href="Fakhr-al-Din%20II">Fakhr-al-Din II</a>, who renovated Shirkuh II's castle (which became known as Fakhr-al-Din al-Maani Castle). The prince fell from grace with the Ottomans in 1633 and lost control of the village, which remained a separate sanjak until it was absorbed by <a href="Zor%20Sanjak">Zor Sanjak</a> in 1857. The village became home to an Ottoman garrison to control the Bedouin in 1867.

In 1918, as <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> was ending, the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> built an airfield for two planes, and in November the Ottomans retreated from Zor Sanjak without a fight. The <a href="Arab%20Kingdom%20of%20Syria%23The%20Arab%20constitutional%20government">Syrian Emirate</a>'s army entered <a href="Deir%20ez-Zor">Deir ez-Zor</a> on 4 December, and Zor Sanjak became part of Syria. In 1919, as the British and French argued over the borders of the planned <a href="League%20of%20Nations%20mandate">mandates</a>, the British permanent military representative to the <a href="Supreme%20War%20Council">Supreme War Council</a> <a href="Sir%20Henry%20Wilson%2C%201st%20Baronet">Henry Wilson</a> suggested adding Palmyra to the <a href="British%20Mandate%20for%20Mesopotamia%20%28legal%20instrument%29">British mandate</a>. However, the British general <a href="Edmund%20Allenby%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Allenby">Edmund Allenby</a> persuaded his government to abandon this plan. Syria (including Palmyra) became part of the <a href="French%20Mandate%20for%20Syria%20and%20the%20Lebanon">French Mandate</a> after Syria's defeat in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Maysalun">Battle of Maysalun</a> on 24 July 1920.

With Palmyra gaining importance in the French efforts to pacify the <a href="Syrian%20Desert">Syrian Desert</a>, a base was constructed in the village near the Temple of Bel in 1921. In 1929, Henri Arnold Seyrig, began excavating the ruins and convinced the villagers to move to a new, French-built village next to the site. The relocation was completed in 1932; ancient Palmyra was ready for excavation as its villagers settled into the new village of <a href="Tadmur">Tadmur</a>. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the Mandate came under the authority of <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy France</a>, who gave permission to <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> to use the airfield at Palmyra; forces of <a href="Free%20France">Free France</a>, backed by British forces, invaded Syria in June 1941, and on 3 July 1941, the British took control over the city in the aftermath of a <a href="Battle%20of%20Palmyra%20%281941%29">battle</a>.

As a result of the <a href="Syrian%20Civil%20War">Syrian Civil War</a>, Palmyra experienced widespread looting and damage by combatants. In 2013, the façade of the Temple of Bel sustained a large hole from <a href="Mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortar</a> fire, and colonnade columns have been damaged by <a href="Fragmentation%20%28weaponry%29">shrapnel</a>. According to Maamoun Abdulkarim, the <a href="Syrian%20Army">Syrian Army</a> positioned its troops in some archaeological-site areas, while <a href="Syrian%20opposition">Syrian opposition</a> fighters positioned themselves in gardens around the city.

On 13 May 2015, ISIL launched an attack on the modern town of Tadmur, sparking fears that the <a href="Iconoclasm">iconoclastic</a> group would destroy the adjacent ancient site of Palmyra. On 21 May, some artifacts were transported from the Palmyra museum to Damascus for safekeeping; a number of Greco-Roman busts, jewelry, and other objects looted from the museum have been found on the international market. ISIL forces entered Palmyra the same day. Local residents reported that the Syrian air force bombed the site on 13 June, damaging the northern wall close to the Temple of Baalshamin. During ISIL's occupation of the site, Palmyra's theatre was used as a place of public executions of their opponents and captives; videos were released by ISIL showing the killing of Syrian prisoners in front of crowds at the theatre. On 18 August, Palmyra's retired antiquities chief <a href="Khaled%20al-Asaad">Khaled al-Asaad</a> was beheaded by ISIL after being tortured for a month to extract information about the city and its treasures; al-Asaad refused to give any information to his captors.

Syrian government forces supported by <a href="Russian%20military%20intervention%20in%20the%20Syrian%20Civil%20War">Russian airstrikes</a> recaptured Palmyra on 27 March 2016 after intense fighting against ISIL fighters. According to initial reports, the damage to the archaeological site was less extensive than anticipated, with numerous structures still standing. Following the recapture of the city, Russian de-mining teams began clearing mines planted by ISIL prior to their retreat. Following heavy fighting, ISIL briefly reoccupied the city on 11 December 2016, prompting an offensive by the Syrian Army which retook the city on 2 March 2017.

From the beginning of its history to the first century AD Palmyra was a petty sheikhdom, and by the first century BC a Palmyrene identity began to develop. During the first half of the first century AD, Palmyra incorporated some of the institutions of a Greek city (polis); the concept of citizenship (<a href="Glossary%20of%20rhetorical%20terms%23Demos">demos</a>) appears in an inscription, dated to AD 10, describing the Palmyrenes as a community. In AD 74, an inscription mentions the city's boule (senate). The tribal role in Palmyra is debated; during the first century, four treasurers representing the four tribes seems to have partially controlled the administration but their role became ceremonial by the second century and power rested in the hands of the council.

The Palmyrene council consisted of about six hundred members of the local elite (such as the elders or heads of wealthy families or clans), representing the city's four-quarters. The council, headed by a president, managed civic responsibilities; it supervised public works (including the construction of public buildings), approved expenditures, collected taxes, and appointed two <a href="Eponymous%20archon">archons</a> (lords) each year. Palmyra's military was led by "<a href="Strategos">strategoi</a>" (generals) appointed by the council. Roman provincial authority set and approved Palmyra's tariff structure, but the provincial interference in local government was kept minimal as the empire sought to ensure the continuous success of Palmyrene trade most beneficial to Rome. An imposition of direct provincial administration would have jeopardized Palmyra's ability to conduct its trading activities in the East, especially in Parthia.

With the elevation of Palmyra to a <a href="Colonia%20%28Roman%29">colonia</a> around 213–216, the city ceased being subject to Roman provincial governors and taxes. Palmyra incorporated Roman institutions into its system while keeping many of its former ones. The council remained, and the "strategos" designated one of two annually-elected magistrates. This "<a href="duumviri">duumviri</a>" implemented the new colonial constitution, replacing the archons. Palmyra's political scene changed with the rise of Odaenathus and his family; an inscription dated to 251 describes Odaenathus' son Hairan I as "Ras" (lord) of Palmyra (exarch in the Greek section of the inscription) and another inscription dated to 252 describes Odaenathus with the same title. Odaenathus was probably elected by the council as exarch, which was an unusual title in the Roman empire and was not part of the traditional Palmyrene governance institutions. Whether Odaenathus' title indicated a military or a priestly position is unknown, but the military role is more likely. By 257 Odaenathus was known as a "<a href="consularis">consularis</a>", possibly the "<a href="legatus">legatus</a>" of the province of Phoenice. In 258 Odaenathus began extending his political influence, taking advantage of regional instability caused by Sasanian aggression; this culminated in the Battle of Edessa, Odaenathus' royal elevation and mobilization of troops, which made Palmyra a kingdom.

The monarchy continued most civic institutions, but the duumviri and the council were no longer attested after 264; Odaenathus appointed a governor for the city. In the absence of the monarch, the city was administered by a <a href="viceroy">viceroy</a>. Although governors of the eastern Roman provinces under Odaenathus' control were still appointed by Rome, the king had overall authority. During Zenobia's rebellion, governors were appointed by the queen. Not all Palmyrenes accepted the dominion of the royal family; a senator, Septimius Haddudan, appears in a later Palmyrene inscription as aiding Aurelian's armies during the 273 rebellion. After the Roman destruction of the city, Palmyra was ruled directly by Rome, and then by a succession of other rulers, including the Burids and Ayyubids, and subordinate Bedouin chiefs—primarily the Fadl family, who governed for the Mamluks.

Due to its military character and efficiency in battle, Palmyra was described by <a href="Irfan%20Shah%C3%AEd">Irfan Shahîd</a> as the "<a href="Sparta">Sparta</a> among the cities of the Orient, Arab and other, and even its gods were represented dressed in military uniforms." Palmyra's army protected the city and its economy, helping extend Palmyrene authority beyond the city walls and protecting the countryside's desert trade routes. The city had a substantial military; Zabdibel commanded a force of 10,000 in the third century BC, and Zenobia led an army of 70,000 in the Battle of Emesa. Soldiers were recruited from the city and its territories, spanning several thousand square kilometers from the outskirts of Homs to the Euphrates valley. Non-Palmyrene soldiers were also recruited; a <a href="Nabataeans">Nabatean</a> cavalryman is recorded in 132 as serving in a Palmyrene unit stationed at <a href="Anah">Anah</a>. Palmyra's recruiting system is unknown; the city might have selected and equipped the troops and the "strategoi" led, trained and disciplined them.

The "strategoi" were appointed by the council with the approval of Rome. The royal army in the mid 3rd century AD was under the leadership of the monarch aided by generals, and was modeled on the <a href="Military%20of%20the%20Sasanian%20Empire">Sasanians</a> in arms and tactics. The Palmyrenes were noted archers. They used infantry while a heavily armored cavalry (<a href="clibanarii">clibanarii</a>) constituted the main attacking force. Palmyra's infantry was armed with swords, lances and small round shields; the clibanarii were fully armored (including their horses), and used heavy spears (<a href="Kontos%20%28weapon%29">kontos</a>) long without shields.

Citing the Palmyrenes' combat skills in large, sparsely populated areas, the Romans formed a Palmyrene <a href="auxilia">auxilia</a> to serve in the <a href="Imperial%20Roman%20army">Imperial Roman army</a>. Vespasian reportedly had 8,000 Palmyrene archers in Judea, and Trajan established the first Palmyrene Auxilia in 116 (a <a href="camel%20cavalry">camel cavalry</a> unit, Ala I Ulpia dromedariorum Palmyrenorum). Palmyrene units were deployed throughout the Roman Empire, serving in <a href="Roman%20Dacia">Dacia</a> late in Hadrian's reign, and at <a href="El%20Kantara">El Kantara</a> in <a href="Numidia">Numidia</a> and <a href="Moesia">Moesia</a> under <a href="Antoninus%20Pius">Antoninus Pius</a>. During the late second century Rome formed the <a href="Cohors%20XX%20Palmyrenorum">Cohors XX Palmyrenorum</a>, which was stationed in Dura-Europos.

Palmyra's gods were primarily part of the <a href="Canaanite%20religion">northwestern Semitic</a> <a href="Pantheon%20%28religion%29">pantheon</a>, with the addition of gods from the <a href="Ancient%20Mesopotamian%20religion">Mesopotamian</a> and <a href="Arabian%20mythology">Arab</a> pantheons. The city's chief pre-Hellenistic deity was called Bol, an abbreviation of <a href="Baal">Baal</a> (a northwestern Semitic honorific). The Babylonian cult of <a href="Bel-Marduk">Bel-Marduk</a> influenced the Palmyrene religion and by 217 BC the chief deity's name was changed to <a href="Bel%20%28mythology%29">Bel</a>. This did not indicate the replacing of the northwestern Semitic Bol with a Mesopotamian deity, but was a mere change in the name.

Second in importance after the supreme deity, were over sixty ancestral gods of the Palmyrene clans. Palmyra had unique deities, such as the god of justice and Efqa's guardian <a href="Yarhibol">Yarhibol</a>, the sun god <a href="Malakbel">Malakbel</a>, and the moon god <a href="Aglibol">Aglibol</a>. Palmyrenes worshiped regional deities, including the greater <a href="Levant">Levant</a>ine gods <a href="Astarte">Astarte</a>, <a href="Baal-hamon">Baal-hamon</a>, Baalshamin and <a href="Atargatis">Atargatis</a>; the Babylonian gods Nabu and <a href="Nergal">Nergal</a>, and the Arab <a href="Azizos">Azizos</a>, <a href="Arsu">Arsu</a>, <a href="Shamash">Šams</a> and Al-lāt.

The deities worshiped in the countryside were depicted as camel or horse riders and bore Arab names. The nature of those deities is uncertain as only names are known, most importantly <a href="Abgal%20%28god%29">Abgal</a>. The Palmyrene pantheon included <a href="ginnaye">ginnaye</a> (some were given the designation "<a href="Gad%20%28deity%29">Gad</a>"), a group of lesser deities popular in the countryside, who were similar to the Arab <a href="jinn">jinn</a> and the Roman <a href="Genius%20%28mythology%29">genius</a>. Ginnaye were believed to have the appearance and behavior of humans, similar to Arab jinn. Unlike jinn, however, the ginnaye could not <a href="Demonic%20possession">possess</a> or injure humans. Their role was similar to the Roman genius: <a href="Tutelary%20deity">tutelary deities</a> who guarded individuals and their caravans, cattle and villages.

Although the Palmyrenes worshiped their deities as individuals, some were associated with other gods. Bel had <a href="Astarte-Belti">Astarte-Belti</a> as his consort, and formed a <a href="triple%20deity">triple deity</a> with Aglibol and Yarhibol (who became a sun god in his association with Bel). Malakbel was part of many associations, pairing with <a href="Gad%20Taimi">Gad Taimi</a> and Aglibol, and forming a triple deity with Baalshamin and Aglibol. Palmyra hosted an <a href="Akitu">Akitu</a> (spring festival) each <a href="Nisan">Nisan</a>. Each of the city's four-quarters had a sanctuary for a deity considered ancestral to the resident tribe; Malakbel and Aglibol's sanctuary was in the Komare quarter. The Baalshamin sanctuary was in the Ma'zin quarter, the Arsu sanctuary in the Mattabol quarter, and the Atargatis sanctuary in the fourth tribe's quarter.

The priests of Palmyra were selected from the city's leading families, and are recognized in busts through their headdresses which have the shape of a <a href="polos">polos</a> adorned with laurel wreath or other tree made of bronze among other elements. The high priest of Bel's temple was the highest religious authority and headed the clergy of priests who were organized into collegia each headed by a higher priest. The personnel of Efqa spring's sanctuary dedicated to Yarhibol belonged to a special class of priests as they were oracles. Palmyra's paganism was replaced with Christianity as the religion spread across the Roman Empire, and a bishop was reported in the city by 325. Although most temples became churches, the Temple of Al-lāt was destroyed in 385 at the order of <a href="Maternus%20Cynegius">Maternus Cynegius</a> (the <a href="Praetorian%20prefecture%20of%20the%20East">eastern praetorian prefect</a>). After the Muslim conquest in 634 <a href="Islam">Islam</a> gradually replaced Christianity, and the last known bishop of Palmyra was consecrated in 818.

In 274, following his victory over Palmyra, Aurelian dedicated a large temple of <a href="Sol%20Invictus">Sol Invictus</a> in Rome; most scholars consider Aurelian's Sol Invictus to be of Syrian origin, either a continuation of emperor <a href="Elagabalus">Elagabalus</a> cult of <a href="Elagabalus%20%28deity%29">Sol Invictus Elagabalus</a>, or Malakbel of Palmyra. The Palmyrene deity was commonly identified with the Roman god <a href="Sol%20%28mythology%29">Sol</a> and he had a temple dedicated for him on the right bank of the <a href="Tiber">Tiber</a> since the second century. Also, he bore the epithet Invictus and was known with the name Sol "Sanctissimus", the latter was an epithet Aurelian bore on an inscription from <a href="Capena">Capena</a>.

The position of the Palmyrene deity as Aurelian's Sol Invictus is inferred from a passage by <a href="Zosimus">Zosimus</a> reading: "and the magnificent temple of the sun he (i.e. Aurelian) embellished with votive gifts from Palmyra, setting up statues of <a href="Helios">Helios</a> and Bel". Three deities from Palmyra exemplified solar features: Malakbel, Yarhibol and Šams, hence the identification of the Palmyrene Helios appearing in Zosimus' work with Malakbel. Some scholars criticize the notion of Malakbel's identification with Sol Invictus; according to <a href="Gaston%20Halsberghe">Gaston Halsberghe</a>, the cult of Malakbel was too local for it to become an imperial Roman god and Aurelian's restoration of Bel's temple and sacrifices dedicated to Malakbel were a sign of his attachment to the sun god in general and his respect to the many ways in which the deity was worshiped. <a href="Richard%20Stoneman">Richard Stoneman</a> suggested another approach in which Aurelian simply borrowed the imagery of Malakbel to enhance his own solar deity. The relation between Malakbel and Sol Invictus can not be confirmed and will probably remain unresolved.

Palmyra's economy before and at the beginning of the Roman period was based on agriculture, pastoralism, and trade; the city served as a rest station for the caravans which sporadically crossed the desert. By the end of the first century BC, the city had a mixed economy based on agriculture, pastoralism, taxation, and, most importantly, the caravan trade. Taxation was an important source of revenue for the Palmyrene government. Caravaneers paid taxes in the building known as the Tariff Court, where a tax law dating to AD 137 was exhibited. The law regulated the tariffs paid by the merchants for goods sold at the internal market or exported from the city.

The classicist <a href="Andrew%20M.%20Smith%20II">Andrew M. Smith II</a> suggested that most land in Palmyra was owned by the city, which collected grazing taxes. The oasis had about of irrigable land, which surrounded the city. The Palmyrenes constructed an extensive irrigation system in the northern mountains that consisted of reservoirs and channels to capture and store the occasional rainfall. The most notable irrigation work is <a href="Harbaqa%20Dam">Harbaqa Dam</a> which was constructed in the late first century AD; it is located southwest of the city and can collect of water. The countryside was intensively planted with olive, <a href="Common%20fig">fig</a>, <a href="pistachio">pistachio</a> and <a href="barley">barley</a>. However, agriculture could not support the population and food was imported.

After Palmyra's destruction in 273, it became a market for villagers and nomads from the surrounding area. The city regained some of its prosperity during the Umayyad era, indicated by the discovery of a large Umayyad "souq" in the colonnaded street. Palmyra was a minor trading center until its destruction in 1400; according to <a href="Sharaf%20ad-Din%20Ali%20Yazdi">Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi</a>, Timur's men took 200,000 sheep, and the city was reduced into a settlement on the desert border whose inhabitants herded and cultivated small plots for vegetables and corn.

If the Laghman II inscription in Afghanistan is referring to Palmyra, then the city's role in Central Asian overland trade was prominent as early as the third century BC. During the first centuries AD, Palmyra's main trade route ran east to the Euphrates where it connected at the city of <a href="H%C4%ABt">Hīt</a>. The route then ran south along the river toward the port of <a href="Charax%20Spasinu">Charax Spasinu</a> on the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, where Palmyrene ships traveled back and forth to India. Goods were imported from India, China and <a href="Transoxiana">Transoxiana</a>, and exported west to Emesa (or Antioch) then the Mediterranean ports, from which they were distributed throughout the Roman Empire. In addition to the usual route some Palmyrene merchants used the <a href="Red%20Sea%23Ancient%20era">Red Sea</a>, probably as a result of the <a href="Roman%E2%80%93Parthian%20Wars">Roman–Parthian Wars</a>. Goods were carried overland from the seaports to a <a href="Nile">Nile</a> port, and then taken to the Egyptian Mediterranean ports for export. Inscriptions attesting a Palmyrene presence in Egypt date to the reign of Hadrian.

Since Palmyra was not on the main trading route (which followed the Euphrates), the Palmyrenes secured the desert route passing their city. They connected it to the Euphrates valley, providing water and shelter. The Palmyrene route connected the Silk Road with the Mediterranean, and was used almost exclusively by the city's merchants, who maintained a presence in many cities, including Dura-Europos in 33 BC, <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a> by AD 19, <a href="Seleucia">Seleucia</a> by AD 24, <a href="Dendera">Dendera</a>, <a href="Qift">Coptos</a>, Bahrain, the <a href="Indus%20River%20Delta">Indus River Delta</a>, <a href="Merv">Merv</a> and Rome.

The caravan trade depended on patrons and merchants. Patrons owned the land on which the caravan animals were raised, providing animals and guards for the merchants. The lands were located in the numerous villages of the Palmyrene countryside. Although merchants used the patrons to conduct business, their roles often overlapped and a patron would sometimes lead a caravan. Commerce made Palmyra and its merchants among the wealthiest in the region. Some caravans were financed by a single merchant, such as Male' Agrippa (who financed Hadrian's visit in 129 and the 139 rebuilding of the Temple of Bel). The primary income-generating trade good was silk, which was exported from the East to the West. Other exported goods included jade, muslin, spices, ebony, ivory and precious stones. For its domestic market Palmyra imported variety of goods including slaves, prostitutes, olive oil, dyed goods, myrrh and perfume.

Palmyra was visited by such travelers as <a href="Pietro%20Della%20Valle">Pietro Della Valle</a> (between 1616 and 1625), <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Tavernier">Jean-Baptiste Tavernier</a> (in 1638), and many <a href="Swedes">Swedish</a> and German explorers. Its first scholarly description appeared in a 1696 book by <a href="Abednego%20Seller">Abednego Seller</a>. In 1751, an expedition led by <a href="Robert%20Wood%20%28antiquarian%29">Robert Wood</a> and <a href="James%20Dawkins%20%28antiquarian%29">James Dawkins</a> studied Palmyra's architecture. French artist and architect <a href="Louis-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Cassas">Louis-François Cassas</a> conducted an extensive survey of the city's monuments in 1785, publishing over a hundred drawings of Palmyra's civic buildings and tombs. Visits by travelers and <a href="antiquarian">antiquarian</a>s continued, including one made by <a href="Lady%20Hester%20Stanhope">Lady Hester Stanhope</a> in 1813, and another by <a href="Lady%20Strangford">Lady Strangford</a> and artist <a href="Carl%20Haag">Carl Haag</a> in 1859. Palmrya was photographed for the first time in 1864 by Louis Vignes.

In 1882, the "Palmyrene Tariff", an inscribed stone slab from AD 137 in Greek and Palmyrene detailing import and export taxation, was discovered by prince <a href="Semyon%20Semyonovich%20Abamelik-Lazarev">Semyon Semyonovich Abamelik-Lazarev</a> in the Tariff Court. It has been described by historian <a href="John%20F.%20Matthews">John F. Matthews</a> as "one of the most important single items of evidence for the economic life of any part of the Roman Empire". In 1901, the slab was gifted by the Ottoman Sultan <a href="Abdul%20Hamid%20II">Abdul Hamid II</a> to the Russian Tsar and is now in the <a href="Hermitage%20Museum">Hermitage Museum</a> in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>.

Palmyra's first excavations were conducted in 1902 by <a href="Otto%20Puchstein">Otto Puchstein</a> and in 1917 by <a href="Theodor%20Wiegand">Theodor Wiegand</a>. In 1929, French general director of antiquities of Syria and Lebanon Henri Arnold Seyrig began large-scale excavation of the site; interrupted by World War II, it resumed soon after the war's end. Seyrig started with the Temple of Bel in 1929 and between 1939 and 1940 he excavated the Agora. Daniel Schlumberger conducted excavations in the Palmyrene northwest countryside in 1934 and 1935 where he studied different local sanctuaries in the Palmyrene villages. From 1954 to 1956, a Swiss expedition organized by <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> excavated the Temple of Baalshamin. Since 1958, the site has been excavated by the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities, and Polish expeditions led by many archaeologists including <a href="Kazimierz%20Micha%C5%82owski">Kazimierz Michałowski</a> (until 1980) and <a href="Michael%20Gawlikowski">Michael Gawlikowski</a> (until 2011). The stratigraphic sounding beneath the Temple of Bel was conducted in 1967 by <a href="Robert%20du%20Mesnil%20du%20Buisson">Robert du Mesnil du Buisson</a>, who also discovered the Temple of Baal-hamon in the 1970s.

The Polish expedition concentrated its work on the Camp of Diocletian while the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities excavated the Temple of Nabu. Most of the hypogea were excavated jointly by the Polish expedition and the Syrian Directorate, while the area of Efqa was excavated by Jean Starcky and <a href="Jafar%20al-Hassani">Jafar al-Hassani</a>. The Palmyrene irrigation system was discovered in 2008 by <a href="J%C3%B8rgen%20Christian%20Meyer">Jørgen Christian Meyer</a> who researched the Palmyrene countryside through ground inspections and satellite images. Most of Palmyra still remains unexplored especially the residential quarters in the north and south while the necropolis has been thoroughly excavated by the Directorate and the Polish expedition. Excavation expeditions left Palmyra in 2011 due to the Syrian Civil War.

In 1980, the historic site including the necropolis outside the walls was declared a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> by the UNESCO. In November 2010 the <a href="Austrians">Austrian</a> media manager Helmut Thoma admitted looting a Palmyrene grave in 1980, stealing architectural pieces for his home; German and Austrian archaeologists protested against the theft.

August Meyszner

August Edler von Meyszner (3 August 1886 – 24 January 1947) was an Austrian <a href="Gendarmerie%20%28Austria%29">Gendarmerie</a> officer, <a href="Right-wing%20politics">right-wing politician</a>, and senior "<a href="Ordnungspolizei">Ordnungspolizei</a>" (order police) officer who held the post of <a href="SS%20and%20police%20leader">Higher SS and Police Leader</a> in the <a href="Territory%20of%20the%20Military%20Commander%20in%20Serbia">German-occupied territory of Serbia</a> from January 1942 to March 1944, during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. He has been described as one of "<a href="Reichsf%C3%BChrer-SS">Reichsführer-SS</a>" <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>'s most brutal subordinates.

Meyszner began his career as an officer in the Gendarmerie, served on the <a href="Italian%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Italian Front</a> during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and reached the rank of "<a href="Major">Major der Polizei</a>" by 1921. He joined the <a href="Austrian%20Nazi%20Party">Austrian Nazi Party</a> in September 1925 and became a right-wing parliamentary <a href="deputy%20%28legislator%29">deputy</a> and provincial minister in the Austrian province of <a href="Styria">Styria</a> in 1930. Due to his involvement with the Nazis, Meyszner was forcibly retired in 1933 and arrested in February 1934, but released after three months at the <a href="W%C3%B6llersdorf-Steinabr%C3%BCckl">Wöllersdorf</a> <a href="concentration%20camp">concentration camp</a>. That July, he was rearrested following an attempted <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup</a>, but escaped police custody and fled to <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, where he joined the "Ordnungspolizei" (Orpo) and then the "<a href="Allgemeine%20SS">Allgemeine SS</a>". After police postings in Austria, Germany and <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20Norway">occupied Norway</a>, Himmler appointed Meyszner as Higher SS and Police Leader in Serbia in early 1942. He was one of few Orpo officers to be appointed to such a role.

Meyszner's time in <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a> was characterised by friction and competition with German military, economic and foreign affairs officials, and by his visceral hatred and distrust of Serbs. During his tenure, he oversaw regular reprisal killings and sent tens of thousands of <a href="forced%20labour">forced labour</a>ers to the Reich and occupied Norway. His <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> detachment used a <a href="gas%20van">gas van</a> to kill 8,000 <a href="Jews">Jewish</a> women and children who had been detained at the <a href="Sajmi%C5%A1te%20concentration%20camp">Sajmište concentration camp</a>. In April 1944, his outspoken complaints about a reduction in reprisals against civilians allowed his enemies within the German occupation regime in Serbia to have him removed. Himmler transferred him to Berlin with the task of establishing a Europe-wide <a href="Gendarmerie">Gendarmerie</a>. After the war, he fell into the hands of the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> and was interrogated by the <a href="Nuremberg%20trials">United States Chief Counsel for the Prosecution of Axis Criminality</a>. Extradited to <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, he was tried for <a href="war%20crime">war crime</a>s, along with many of his staff from his time in Serbia. He was found guilty by a Yugoslav military court and executed by hanging in January 1947.

August Edler von Meyszner was born in <a href="Graz">Graz</a>, <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> on 3 August 1886, the son of Rudolf Edler von Meyszner, an "<a href="Oberstleutnant">Oberstleutnant</a>" (<a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a>) in the <a href="Imperial-Royal%20Landwehr">Imperial-Royal Landwehr</a> who had been knighted two years earlier, and his wife Therese ( Tuschner). His uncle was "<a href="Lieutenant%20general">Feldmarschalleutnant</a>" (<a href="Major%20general">Major general</a>) Ferdinand von Meyszner. He completed primary and secondary schooling in Graz, before attending a cadet school in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>. In 1908, he was posted to the 3rd Imperial-Royal Landwehr Infantry Regiment in Graz as an <a href="officer%20candidate">officer candidate</a> and on 1 May 1908 was commissioned as a "<a href="Leutnant">Leutnant</a>" (<a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a>) in the Leoben Battalion. Until 30 April 1913 he was a company officer with the signals and telephone detachment, and was also responsible for the ski training of the battalion. On 1 May 1913, he was transferred to the provincial <a href="Gendarmerie">Gendarmerie</a> at his own request, initially stationed at <a href="Trieste">Triest</a>. In 1914 he underwent an examination for his new duties as a gendarmerie officer, and on 1 May 1914 he was formally accepted into the Austrian Gendarmerie Service.

He was initially appointed to command the 5th Gendarmerie Detachment in <a href="Gorizia">Görz</a> (now the Italian town of Gorizia). On 23 June 1914 he was promoted to Gendarmerie-"<a href="Oberleutnant">Oberleutnant</a>" (<a href="first%20lieutenant">first lieutenant</a>). In August he was appointed to command the coastal gendarmerie section at <a href="Grado%2C%20Friuli-Venezia%20Giulia">Grado</a> and the following month he was transferred to the border guard section based at <a href="Tolmin">Tolmein</a>, in modern-day <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>. A few days after the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Meyszner married Pia Gostischa from <a href="Maribor">Marburg an der Drau</a> (Maribor); the couple eventually had one daughter and one son. On 19 May 1915, Meyszner was posted as the commander of a gendarmerie company on the <a href="Italian%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Italian Front</a>. Later that year he was appointed as the commander of the <a href="Alpine%20companies">12th Alpine Company</a>. On 1 August 1916, he was promoted to "<a href="Rittmeister">Rittmeister</a>" (captain) with effect from 11 August. During 1916–1917, Meyszner was a gendarmerie section commander, and in 1917 he served as an alpine advisor to the 15th Mountain Brigade. In August 1917 he was recalled to gendarmerie duties in Triest. In November 1918 he was transferred to the Styrian gendarmerie command in Graz. He was wounded once, and was also awarded several decorations for his service during the war, including the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Iron%20Crown%20%28Austria%29">Order of the Iron Crown 3rd Class</a>, <a href="Military%20Merit%20Cross%20%28Austria-Hungary%29">Military Merit Cross 3rd Class</a>, <a href="Military%20Merit%20Medal%20%28Austria-Hungary%29">Military Merit Medal with Swords and War Decoration</a>, <a href="Karl%20Troop%20Cross">Karl Troop Cross</a> and <a href="Red%20Cross%20Medal%20%28Prussia%29">Red Cross Decoration 2nd Class</a>.

In December 1919, Meyszner was placed in charge of the border gendarmerie at the <a href="Styria">Styria</a>n town of <a href="Judenburg">Judenburg</a>, on the frontier with the newly created <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (later Yugoslavia), and was involved in fighting there. That year, he had become involved with the German-nationalist sporting association "Deutsch-Völkischen Turnvereins" and was made a leader in the <a href="Right-wing%20politics">right-wing</a> <a href="paramilitary">paramilitary</a> "<a href="Styrian%20Home%20Guard">Steirischen Heimatschutz</a>" (Styrian Home Guard). He later used his senior position in the gendarmerie to funnel arms to the Home Guard.

Meyszner remained stationed at Judenburg for the next nine years, although he was sent on several detachments. In 1921, he was promoted to "<a href="Major">Major der Polizei</a>" (Major of Police). While commanding a gendarmerie detachment sent to oversee the unification of <a href="Burgenland">Burgenland</a> with Austria in August 1921, Meyszner was shot in the leg by local <a href="Hungarians">Hungarians</a> rebelling against the transfer. In 1922, his unit subdued significant labour unrest in the Judenburg region and in 1927 it quelled a strike in the aftermath of the <a href="July%20Revolt%20of%201927">July Revolt of 1927</a>. Meyszner joined the <a href="Austrian%20National%20Socialism">Austrian Nazi Party</a> on 5 September 1925, and was allocated membership number 10,617. In May 1927 he was granted an audience with <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, along with two of his Home Guard comrades, <a href="Walter%20Pfrimer">Walter Pfrimer</a> and <a href="Hanns%20Albin%20Rauter">Hanns Albin Rauter</a>. On 1 January 1929, Meyszner was transferred to Graz where he came into contact with more right-wing organisations.

In 1930, Meyszner became a right-wing <a href="Deputy%20%28legislator%29">deputy</a> in the Styrian provincial parliament () representing the "Heimatblock", the political wing of the "Heimatschutz", and because of the Styrian system of proportional representation he also became a minister of the provincial government. His governmental responsibilities meant that he was unable to take an active part in the abortive <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> led by Pfrimer in 1931 but while claiming he knew nothing of the "putsch" beforehand, he openly stated in the "Landtag" that he approved of it. Pfrimer and his co-conspirator <a href="Konstantin%20Kammerhofer">Konstantin Kammerhofer</a> went into hiding, and in the short term, Meyszner was the leader of the Home Guard. Meyszner continued his Home Guard activities and together with Rauter he began to forge closer links with the Austrian Nazi Party, holding several meetings with Hitler's delegate in Austria, <a href="Theodor%20Habicht">Theodor Habicht</a>. In late 1933 the negotiations would culminate in the so-called Venice agreement, by which Home Guard was transferred into the Nazi Party. The fact that Meyszner had completely adopted Nazi ideology was demonstrated by his anti-Jewish diatribe in the "Landestag" in April 1933. From March 1933, the authoritarian <a href="Fatherland%20Front%20%28Austria%29">Fatherland Front</a> government of <a href="Engelbert%20Dollfuss">Engelbert Dollfuss</a> prorogued parliamentary government and in June they banned the Austrian Nazi Party and the Home Guard. A few days before this, public servants who were members of the Austrian Nazi Party were classified as subversive. Based on these decrees, Meyszner was also denied his seat in parliament and forcibly retired from the gendarmerie in September 1933 at the age of 47.

As a result of his meetings with Habicht, Meyszner was appointed deputy leader of the Central Styria "<a href="Sturmabteilung">Sturmabteilung</a>"-Brigade, with the rank of SA-"<a href="Obersturmbannf%C3%BChrer">Obersturmbannführer</a>". The "Sturmabteilung" (SA) was the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party. He travelled widely, meeting Nazi leaders in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Hungary</a> and Yugoslavia. In February 1934 he was interned in the <a href="W%C3%B6llersdorf-Steinabr%C3%BCckl">Wöllersdorf</a> <a href="concentration%20camp">concentration camp</a> for three-and-a-half months for Nazi activities. Following a hunger strike and half-hearted prison revolt, he was released. Soon after, the leaders of the Styrian Home Guard were arrested and Meyszner took control of the organisation. Arrested shortly after the abortive <a href="July%20Putsch">July Putsch</a> was launched, during which Dollfuss was assassinated, Meyszner escaped police custody on 27 July and fled to Yugoslavia. Austrian authorities suspected that he had encouraged participation and provided supplies to the conspirators. His exact role in the July Putsch remains in question. The Styrian Home Guard and Styrian SA brigades played significant parts in the attempted putsch. According to the Austrian historian Hans Schafranek, Meyszner, along with Rauter and Kammerhofer, who led the Upper Styrian SA-Brigade, conspired with Habicht and the SS against the SA, effectively bypassing the leadership of the Austrian SA when they quickly supported the coup.
In Yugoslavia, Meyszner was no longer able to access his pension and had few assets, and worked as the cultural policy chief of the centre for Nazi fugitives. He travelled to Germany by sea in November 1934. He first went to the camp for Nazi fugitives at <a href="Miastko">Rummelsburg</a> in <a href="Province%20of%20Pomerania%20%281815%E2%80%931945%29">Pomerania</a>, before transferring to a similar facility in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. Once in Germany, he submitted his <a href="r%C3%A9sum%C3%A9">résumé</a> to the "<a href="Allgemeine%20SS">Allgemeine SS</a>". At the time, the "Allgemeine SS" was a relatively new paramilitary arm of the German Nazi Party that was overtaking the SA in importance. In his résumé, he emphasised his experience as a political organiser and speaker and suggested that a purely military task would not make best use of his knowledge and skills.

Meyszner was briefly given a job coordinating support for Nazi fugitives from Austria on behalf of the SA. On 14 February 1935, he joined the "Allgemeine SS" and received the membership number 263,406 and the rank of SS-"<a href="Oberf%C3%BChrer">Oberführer</a>". He then worked as SS Leader for Special Purposes of the "<a href="Reichsf%C3%BChrer-SS">Reichsführer-SS</a>" <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>, allocated to the "Kommando Sammelstelle". He received German citizenship in May 1935. On 1 September 1935 he joined the "<a href="Schutzpolizei%20%28Nazi%20Germany%29">Schutzpolizei</a>" (protection police), a branch of the uniformed "<a href="Ordnungspolizei">Ordnungspolizei</a>" (order police, or Orpo), in the rank of "Major der Schutzpolizei". He had been honourably discharged from the SA but his acceptance into the "Allgemeine SS" was short-lived, as police officers were not permitted to be members of the "Allgemeine SS" at that time. Meyszner was obliged to resign from the "Allgemeine SS" in October 1935. On 20 April 1937, he was promoted to the rank of "Oberstleutnant der Polizei" (lieutenant colonel of police). He was allowed to return to the "Allgemeine SS" in October 1937 and returned to his previous rank of "SS-<a href="Oberf%C3%BChrer">Oberführer</a>" (SS-senior colonel), backdated to February 1935. He was appointed to the staff of "SS-Abschnitt" III (SS District III), and "Schutzpolizei" Group East Berlin. In 1937, Meyszner was appointed as an honorary judge of the <a href="People%27s%20Court%20%28Germany%29">People's Court</a>, and in 1941 this appointment was extended. With units of the "Ordnungspolizei" Meyszner entered Austria during the "<a href="Anschluss">Anschluss</a>" on 12 March 1938. Residing in Vienna he became acting Inspector of the Orpo in <a href="Austria%20in%20the%20time%20of%20National%20Socialism">Austria</a> and was promoted to the rank of "<a href="Oberst">Oberst der Polizei</a>" (colonel of police) on 18 March 1938. In the <a href="German%20election%20and%20referendum%2C%201938">election and referendum of 10 April 1938</a> he was elected as a deputy in the <a href="Reichstag%20%28Nazi%20Germany%29">Reichstag</a>, a position he retained to the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. As from 12 April 1938 he was assigned as Inspector of the Orpo to the State Secretary for Security in Austria, <a href="Ernst%20Kaltenbrunner">Ernst Kaltenbrunner</a>.

Soon after he had taken office Meyszner clashed with Kaltenbrunner, requiring the intervention of the Chief of the Orpo, "<a href="Obergruppenf%C3%BChrer">SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Polizei</a>" <a href="Kurt%20Daluege">Kurt Daluege</a>. Meyszner was transferred to the <a href="Sudetenland">Sudetenland</a> in early October 1938, after its <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20Czechoslovakia">annexation by Germany</a>, as an Orpo district commander. On 20 April 1939, he was promoted to "<a href="Generalmajor">Generalmajor</a> der Ordnungspolizei". In June 1939, he was again transferred, this time to <a href="Kassel">Kassel</a>, as Inspector of Orpo for the <a href="Free%20State%20of%20Prussia">Prussian</a> province of <a href="Hesse-Nassau">Hesse-Nassau</a>. He remained in this role until 10 September 1940, during which time he was promoted to SS-"<a href="Brigadef%C3%BChrer">Brigadeführer</a>" on 20 April 1940.

After war broke out, Meyszner was appointed to more senior positions, beginning in early 1940 when he was named a representative of the <a href="SS%20and%20police%20leader">Higher SS and Police Leader</a> (, HSSPF) for Fulda-Werra, "SS-Obergruppenführer" <a href="Josias%2C%20Hereditary%20Prince%20of%20Waldeck%20and%20Pyrmont">Josias Waldeck-Pyrmont</a>. On 10 September 1940, Himmler appointed Meyszner to command the Orpo in newly <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20Norway">occupied Norway</a>, working with HSSPF "Nord", "SS-Obergruppenführer" <a href="Wilhelm%20Rediess">Wilhelm Rediess</a>. During 1941, Meyszner was awarded the <a href="War%20Merit%20Cross">War Merit Cross</a> 2nd Class with Swords. In mid-January 1942, he was recalled to Germany and, despite his low rank, attended a conference of senior SS leaders at Hegewald, Himmler's field headquarters near Hitler's <a href="Wolf%27s%20Lair">Wolf's Lair</a> in <a href="East%20Prussia">East Prussia</a>. The conference discussed the use of <a href="Forced%20labour%20under%20German%20rule%20during%20World%20War%20II">forced labour</a>, the coming <a href="Final%20Solution">Final Solution</a> and "<a href="Generalplan%20Ost">Generalplan Ost</a>", a plan for the colonisation of Central and Eastern Europe by ethnic Germans. According to the German historian Martin Moll, Meyszner's suitability for working in the <a href="Territory%20of%20the%20Military%20Commander%20in%20Serbia">German-occupied territory of Serbia</a> was discussed at the conference. On 1 January 1942, Meyszner was promoted to SS-"<a href="Gruppenf%C3%BChrer">Gruppenführer</a>", and on 20 January, he was promoted to "<a href="Generalleutnant">Generalleutnant</a> der Polizei", backdated to 1 January 1942.

The German-occupied territory of Serbia, an area of Yugoslavia roughly corresponding to the borders of the pre-1912 <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Kingdom of Serbia</a>, had been retained under military administration following the April 1941 German-led <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a>. The German military administration supervised a Serbian puppet regime known as the <a href="Government%20of%20National%20Salvation">Government of National Salvation</a>, led by the former Yugoslav Minister of War, <a href="Milan%20Nedi%C4%87">Milan Nedić</a>. The appointment of a HSSPF had not been planned and this initially accorded with the preferences of the "<a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a>" commander in the territory. A <a href="Uprising%20in%20Serbia%20%281941%29">communist-led uprising</a> had erupted in mid-1941 and while it had been brutally suppressed during <a href="Operation%20Uzice">Operation Uzice</a> in December, it was expected to return in early 1942. To address this, Himmler decided to appoint a HSSPF for the occupied territory, as he considered the existing occupation regime was not being sufficiently harsh with the Serbs. Meyszner was chosen for the new position, despite the fact that few HSSPF were selected from the Orpo. At 55 years old, Meyszner was also the oldest HSSPF appointed.

Meyszner arrived in <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a> in late January 1942, inserted into a political maelstrom of conflicting lines of command and authority. Even the military lines of command were confusing. One branch of the military staff was responsible for the administration of the occupied territory and another was responsible for military operations against the insurgents. A few weeks after Meyszner's arrival, the two military positions were combined into the Commanding General and Military Commander in Serbia, in the person of "<a href="General%20der%20Artillerie">General der Artillerie</a>" (Lieutenant general) <a href="Paul%20Bader">Paul Bader</a>, who had previously been the Plenipotentiary Commanding General in Serbia. Bader reported to the "Wehrmacht" Commander in South-East Europe, "<a href="General%20der%20Pioniere">General der Pioniere</a>" (Lieutenant general) <a href="Walter%20Kuntze">Walter Kuntze</a>, who reported directly to Hitler. The military chain of command considered Meyszner's appointment "a very peremptory organisational change". Kuntze's chief of staff described Meyszner as one "for whom we did not ask".

Bader's staff was split into a military command staff led by "Oberst" (Colonel) Erich Kewisch and an administrative staff under the control of "SS-Gruppenführer" <a href="Harald%20Turner">Harald Turner</a>. Kewisch's staff had direct control of the regional defence battalions and worked with the military forces of occupation in the territory. Turner's staff supervised the Serbian puppet regime, the German commandants of the four military districts and the police and security forces.

Overlapping the military chain of command, there was a plenipotentiary of the <a href="Foreign%20Office%20%28Germany%29">Foreign Office</a>, <a href="Felix%20Benzler">Felix Benzler</a>, reporting to the Foreign Minister, <a href="Joachim%20von%20Ribbentrop">Joachim von Ribbentrop</a>, and for economic affairs, a representative of "<a href="Reichsmarschall">Reichsmarschall</a>" <a href="Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">Hermann Göring</a>, <a href="Franz%20Neuhausen">Franz Neuhausen</a>. These power structures competed with each other, to a greater extent than anywhere else in occupied Europe. Meyszner's appointment further complicated an already complex situation, as prior to this decision, Turner had been responsible for police and security matters. Meyszner had to formally acknowledge Bader as his superior but received his orders from Hitler and Himmler. One of his priorities was to improve coordination of policies towards the "<a href="Volksdeutsche">Volksdeutsche</a>" (or <a href="Germans%20of%20Yugoslavia">Germans of Yugoslavia</a>), concentrated in the <a href="Banat%20%281941%E2%80%9344%29">Banat</a> region, as the decision had been made in late 1941 to subject them to conscription in order to raise a "<a href="Waffen-SS">Waffen-SS</a>" division. This decision, approved by Hitler a few days before Meyszner's appointment, had strengthened Himmler's case for a HSSPF in Belgrade.

Meyszner took control of the police organs that had formerly been under the control of Turner, grouped as "<a href="Einsatzgruppe%20Serbia">Einsatzgruppe Serbia</a>", consisting of "<a href="Sicherheitsdienst">Sicherheitsdienst</a>" (Security Service, or SD) and "<a href="Sicherheitspolizei">Sicherheitspolizei</a>" (Security Police, or SiPo), as well as the 64th Reserve Police Battalion. These had been commanded by "SS-<a href="Standartenf%C3%BChrer">Standartenführer</a>" (SS-Colonel) <a href="Wilhelm%20Fuchs">Wilhelm Fuchs</a>, who had overseen the shooting of many Serbian and Jewish males and others, mainly by "Wehrmacht" units, between August 1941 and the end of that year. Meyszner's deputy was "SS-Standartenführer" <a href="Emanuel%20Sch%C3%A4fer">Emanuel Schäfer</a> and the head of the Belgrade <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> was "SS-<a href="Sturmbannf%C3%BChrer">Sturmbannführer</a>" (SS-Major) <a href="Bruno%20Sattler">Bruno Sattler</a>. The head of the Gestapo Jewish Section was "SS-<a href="Untersturmf%C3%BChrer">Untersturmführer</a>" (SS-Lieutenant) Fritz Stracke.

As soon as he took office, Meyszner embarked on a thorough re-organisation of all police operations in the occupied territory. He created four police area commands, aligned to the four military area commands, and ten police districts, corresponding to the military district commands. He took under his command the forces of the Serbian puppet government, known as the <a href="Serbian%20State%20Guard">Serbian State Guard</a>, and also established a number of auxiliary and volunteer police units across the whole territory. One of the units controlled by Meyszner was the Auxiliary Police Troop, recruited from Russian "Volksdeutsche" from the occupied territory but also from Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece and Romania and trained by the Orpo. It was planned to reach a strength of 400 men but little is known about its activities.

As HSSPF, Meyszner was not restricted to police matters. His subordination to Bader was "personal and direct" but this did not mean the police and security apparatus he commanded was subject to day-to-day direction from Bader's headquarters staff. Military jurisdiction over Meyszner and his organisation was restricted to matters involving the military security of the territory and military operations. Meyszner's duties also extended to any matter related to the "strengthening" of the German minority in Serbia, which included authority over the security forces of the puppet regime and collection of revenue and the consolidation and utilisation of existing Volksdeutsche volunteer units in the "Waffen-SS". Almost as soon as he arrived in Belgrade, Meyszner met with "SS-Obergruppenführer" <a href="Werner%20Lorenz">Werner Lorenz</a>, the Chief of the "<a href="Hauptamt%20Volksdeutsche%20Mittelstelle">Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle</a>" (Main Welfare Office for Ethnic Germans, or VoMi), founded to manage the interests of the "Volksdeutsche" outside the borders of the Reich. The VoMi was also responsible for orchestrating the Nazi ideology of "<a href="Lebensraum">Lebensraum</a>" (living space) in Eastern Europe. Meyszner also met with "SS-<a href="Obersturmf%C3%BChrer">Obersturmführer</a>" (SS-Lieutenant colonel) <a href="Sepp%20Janko">Sepp Janko</a>, the leader of the "Volksdeutsche" in the Banat and with "SS-<a href="Brigadef%C3%BChrer">Brigadeführer</a> und Generalmajor der Waffen SS" <a href="Artur%20Phleps">Artur Phleps</a>, to discuss the formation of the new division, the <a href="7th%20SS%20Volunteer%20Mountain%20Division%20Prinz%20Eugen">7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division "Prinz Eugen"</a>. Plans for more general conscription of the "Volksdeutsche" did not meet with approval from Berlin.

As soon as he took up his role, Meyszner immediately ran into difficulties with Turner, who was responsible for internal affairs and co-operation with the puppet regime. Turner was a proponent of strengthening the puppet regime and making use of all Serbs that were willing to collaborate with the occupiers. Meyszner had a diametrically opposed personal view and throughout his time in Belgrade refused to support or work with the Serb authorities, except at a purely tactical level. His dislike of Serbs was so great that he is said to have remarked, "I like a dead Serb better than a live one". Meyszner was also reported to have referred to Serbs as "a people of rats" (). The historian <a href="Jonathan%20Steinberg">Jonathan Steinberg</a> describes Meyszner as one of Himmler's most brutal subordinates.

In April, Turner wrote in a self-congratulatory tone to Himmler's personal staff officer, "SS-Obergruppenführer" <a href="Karl%20Wolff">Karl Wolff</a>, stating that he had already had all the available Jewish men killed and all the women and children placed in the <a href="Sajmi%C5%A1te%20concentration%20camp">Sajmište concentration camp</a>. He went on to claim that he had arranged, with the help of the SD, a <a href="gas%20van">gas van</a> to clear the camp in a period of a fortnight to four weeks. <a href="The%20Holocaust">Holocaust</a> historian <a href="Christopher%20Browning">Christopher Browning</a> considers this claim suspect, stating that Turner's reports about Jewish affairs were often inaccurate and self-serving in an attempt to ingratiate himself with Hitler and shore up his position. Browning's view is that a van was dispatched after regular requests from Belgrade for the remaining Jews to be deported directly, so that the local authorities could resolve the matter themselves. When the van arrived in Belgrade, Meyszner was kept informed, and Schäfer asked him for directions.

Schäfer delegated the task of killing the Jewish women and children to Sattler. In turn, Sattler tasked the camp commandant, "SS-Untersturmfuhrer" <a href="Herbert%20Andorfer">Herbert Andorfer</a>, to accompany the van, which would be operated by two "SS-Scharführers" (<a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>s) sent with the van from Berlin. Except for Sundays and public holidays, the van collected groups of about 100 women and children from the camp on a daily basis and drove them to a shooting range outside Belgrade. During the trip, the exhaust would be redirected into the cargo area, killing the occupants. On arrival at the range, a four-man detachment from the German 64th Reserve Police Battalion would be waiting with a group of seven Serbian prisoners from the Belgrade prison. The prisoners would unload the van and put the corpses in a pre-dug mass grave. By 10 May 1942, the camp was empty and as many as 8,000 Jewish women and children had been killed by Meyszner's Gestapo. On 8 June, Schäfer declared to a group of "Wehrmacht" officers, including Bader and Kuntze, that there was "no longer a Jewish question in Serbia".

Turner and Meyszner clashed continually throughout 1942, as Meyszner sought to remove all police matters from Turner's remit, including the supervision of the security forces of the Serbian collaborationist regime. In response, Turner fought hard to maintain control over these areas. Meyszner believed the only way to maintain peace and security was the use of brutal police methods; Turner wanted to empower the Nedić regime and then replace the military administration with a civil one, akin to the "<a href="Reichskommissariat%20Niederlande">Reichskommissariat Niederlande</a>", with himself as "Reichskommissar" (governor). Meyszner attempted to have Turner's staff downgraded and incorporated into Bader's staff but Wolff intervened to prevent this. Turner's approach was also seriously out-of-step with the "Wehrmacht", which considered the territory a combat zone and wanted to eliminate inefficiencies and overlapping jurisdictions.

Despite their initial misgivings, the "Wehrmacht" established a good working relationship with Meyszner during 1942. Bader and Meyszner met regularly and supported each other where their interests coincided. By contrast, the conflict between Meyszner and Turner soon became intractable – they sent long letters of complaint to each other which they copied to Himmler. Himmler stuck to his general approach, which was that SS officers should resolve their differences face-to-face. Meyszner fundamentally opposed any attempts by Turner to expand the remit of the Serbian puppet regime, including the creation of sporting organisations and the re-opening of the <a href="University%20of%20Belgrade">University of Belgrade</a>, asserting that it could not be in Germany's interests to "breed hostile Slavic intelligence".

Meyszner's reports to Himmler fuelled distrust of the Serbian security forces, stating that it was "insane" to arm the 16,000-strong Serbian State Guard, as he believed that their loyalties lay with the <a href="royalist">royalist</a> <a href="Chetniks">Chetnik</a> leader <a href="Dra%C5%BEa%20Mihailovi%C4%87">Draža Mihailović</a>, not with the Germans or the Nedić regime. The depths to which Turner and Meyszner's personal vendetta plunged is demonstrated by the fact that they could not even agree on how to use the funds stolen from Serbian Jews killed as part of the Final Solution in 1941 and the first half of 1942. On 1 August 1942, Kuntze was replaced as "Wehrmacht" Commander in South-East Europe by "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" "<a href="Generaloberst">Generaloberst</a>" <a href="Alexander%20L%C3%B6hr">Alexander Löhr</a>, another Austrian. In early September 1942, Meyszner filed an official report with Himmler alleging that Turner had breached section 90 of the <a href="Strafgesetzbuch">German Penal Code</a> by betraying state secrets. Concerned by this attack, in mid-September Turner issued an order to his staff directing them to defer to the authority of the HSSPF and his staff in all police matters and also many other administrative and highly political matters, such as the approval of events, gambling, <a href="Freedom%20of%20assembly">right of assembly</a> and monitoring of commerce. The dispute was so out-of-hand that only outside intervention would be effective. In October, the <a href="SS%20Personalhauptamt">Main SS Personnel Office</a> sent an emissary to Belgrade to investigate and report on the situation. This report described the behaviour of both Turner and Meyszner as "shameful" but the die was cast.

On 17 October, Himmler met with Meyszner at <a href="Kraljevo">Kraljevo</a> while inspecting the newly created 7th SS Division. While mildly rebuking Meyszner and warning him that if such behaviour recurred, Himmler would have to dismiss him, Himmler was impressed with the new division. According to Moll, an important factor in Himmler's final decision was undoubtedly the fact that the dismissal of Turner, part of the "Wehrmacht" command structure, would be much less embarrassing for him than the dismissal of his personal representative, Meyszner. Despite the fact that Turner was "strict and unyielding", he was far more considerate of the concerns of Nedić, his regime and the Serbian population than any other senior member of the government of occupation. It was not just Meyszner's machinations that eventually unseated Turner, because he had been joined in his call for Turner's replacement by Kuntze. On 7 or 8 November 1942, Turner and his deputy Georg Kiessel were forced out and Turner was succeeded by his legal department chief, Walter Uppenkamp. In December 1942, Löhr was redesignated as Commander-in-Chief South-East Europe and Commander <a href="Army%20Group%20E">Army Group E</a> but the local command situation did not change. During 1942, Meyszner was awarded the War Merit Cross 1st Class with Swords.

In January 1943, Nedić proposed a <a href="basic%20law">basic law</a> for Serbia, in effect a constitution creating an authoritarian <a href="Corporatism">corporative state</a> similar to that long advocated by <a href="Dimitrije%20Ljoti%C4%87">Dimitrije Ljotić</a> and his pre-war fascist <a href="Yugoslav%20National%20Movement">Yugoslav National Movement</a>. Bader asked the various agency heads for their views, and despite some specialists recommending its adoption, Meyszner strongly opposed it, seeing it as a threat to German interests. Passed to Löhr then to Hitler, a response was received in March. Hitler considered it "untimely".

In March 1943, Meyszner complained to Himmler that Benzler had adopted a "soft" policy towards the Serbs, allowing them to take charge of the supervision of crops. He considered those that granted additional powers and freedoms to the Serbian puppet regime were irresponsible, because they did not understand the real motives of the various Serb groups. One of many matters of concern to Meyszner was the formation of the <a href="Serbian%20Volunteer%20Corps%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Serbian Volunteer Corps</a>, which was an extension of Ljotić's movement. Meyszner thought that Turner and Benzler had erred in allowing its formation and observed that it was spreading royalist propaganda. According to Moll, Meyszner's perspective was very narrow and did not take into account foreign policy objectives associated with giving some power to the Nedić regime. By the end of 1942, Meyszner had extracted all the usable military manpower from the "Volksdeutsche" of the Banat and the economy and administration of that territory was suffering. As a consequence, he requested the release of all men aged 40 and over from service in the 7th SS Division. As an alternative, he turned his attention to the minority groups that also lived in the Banat, including Hungarians, Romanians and Slovaks. His recommendation that these people be subjected to conscription was not accepted by Himmler.

From the time he had fled to Germany, Meyszner had been engaged in a dispute regarding his membership in the Nazi Party. He had maintained that the Venice Agreement meant that he and other members of the Styrian Home Guard had been accepted into the Nazi Party with prestigious low membership numbers corresponding to the dates of their entry into the Home Guard. The treasurer of the Nazi Party, <a href="Franz%20Xaver%20Schwarz">Franz Xaver Schwarz</a>, did not accept the Agreement and determined that the members of the Styrian Home Guard were not automatically transferred to the Nazi Party. This became an issue when Hitler decided to mark the 10th anniversary of his <a href="Nazi%20seizure%20of%20power">seizure of power</a> and tasked his private secretary and head of the <a href="Nazi%20Party%20Chancellery">Nazi Party Chancellery</a>, "<a href="Reichsleiter">Reichsleiter</a>" <a href="Martin%20Bormann">Martin Bormann</a>, to determine who should be issued one of a strictly limited number of <a href="Golden%20Party%20Badge">Golden Party Badge</a>s to mark the anniversary. Meyszner, who had been recommended by Himmler, accepted that his party membership was retrospectively determined to be 1 June 1938 and he was allocated a party number of 6,119,650. Thus he effectively joined the Nazi Party as late as 1943. Due to these decisions, Meyszner did not qualify as an "<a href="Alter%20K%C3%A4mpfer">Alter Kämpfer</a>" (Old Fighter) and Himmler had to intervene on behalf of Meyszner to ensure he received the badge. Meyszner was one of only five SS men that Himmler deemed worthy of this particular award.

Using his responsibility for the "Volksdeutsche" of the Banat as a pretext, Meyszner constantly interfered with operational orders issued to the 7th SS Division. In September 1943, the total police forces at his disposal comprised the <a href="5th%20SS%20Police%20Regiment">5th SS-Polizei Regiment</a>, minus one company detached to <a href="Axis%20occupation%20of%20Greece">occupied Greece</a> and seven battalions of "Hilfspolizei" (auxiliary police) of various ethnicities, which had only received 4–5 weeks training due to constant employment.

The good relationship between Bader and Meyszner continued until early 1943, when Bader became aware Meyszner had been undermining him in his reports to Himmler, blaming the "Wehrmacht" for the failure to combat the Partisan threat. In April 1943, Bader wrote to Löhr complaining bitterly about Meyszner allocating 300 <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> to the <a href="Russian%20Corps">Russian Factory Protection Group</a> without consulting him and the fact that he had not been advised of desertions from the Serbian Volunteer Corps. Bader described his situation as "impossible", observing that Meyszner was disputing his orders through the police chain of command but that he, Bader, was held responsible for all matters concerning the occupied territory. Thereafter, Bader was no longer Meyszner's ally and this did not bode well for any future clashes with other powerful individuals in the occupation regime. Nedić continued to rail against German occupation policy and the fact that he had to report to four different authorities, who issued sometimes contradictory orders. In May, Meyszner attended a meeting at the Foreign Office, at which he disparaged Nedić and his loyalty to Germany, stating that he could be considered reliable only in fighting the communists. In July and August, some simplification occurred, when Neuhausen was appointed as chief of the military administration staff, but Meyszner remained largely independent. Meyszner's police and security apparatus continued to carry out reprisals when requested by the "Wehrmacht". At the end of June, Meyszner ordered the execution of 575 prisoners in response to an attack in which eight German auxiliary police officers were killed and seven were wounded.

In September 1943, a new plenipotentiary of the Foreign Ministry was appointed for the Balkans. This made Benzler's position redundant and he was recalled to Berlin. Special Envoy <a href="Hermann%20Neubacher">Hermann Neubacher</a> arrived in Belgrade armed with orders from Hitler, directing him to undertake a range of tasks aimed at unifying the fight against communist forces in south-east Europe. These orders specifically directed Neubacher to make best use of the local anti-communist forces and to negotiate with them to achieve that goal. He was also empowered to streamline the German occupation administration and transfer more power to local proxies, like the Nedić regime. The orders also placed Neubacher in charge of all decisions regarding the carrying out of reprisals against the local population. But like Meyszner, Neubacher found that the local conditions meant his ability to carry out his mandate was limited. Neuhausen, having recently been appointed as the chief of the military administration, had far more real power than Neubacher and was doing too good a job of exploiting the Serbian economy to hand any of it over to the Serbian puppet regime. Meyszner himself was strictly opposed to the transfer of any power to the Nedić administration and also resisted attempts to conclude agreements with the Chetniks to fight the Partisans, seeing the former as an attempt to return to Turner's failed policies. According to the historian <a href="Jozo%20Tomasevich">Jozo Tomasevich</a>, the main success Neubacher was able to achieve was a significant reduction in reprisals, although Moll disputes this conclusion. Neubacher was contemptuous of Meyszner and what Neubacher called his "totally primitive extermination thesis".

In November, Meyszner's area of responsibility was expanded to include the <a href="German%20occupied%20territory%20of%20Montenegro">German occupied territory of Montenegro</a>. The following month, "SS-Standartenführer" <a href="Paul%20Blobel">Paul Blobel</a>'s "<a href="Sonderaktion%201005">Kommando 1005</a>" arrived in Belgrade to dig up and burn the bodies of the Jewish women and children killed by Meyszner's Gestapo. At the end of 1943, Meyszner was awarded the <a href="Iron%20Cross">Iron Cross</a> 2nd Class.

In February 1944, Meyszner's campaign against the German-Chetnik agreements escalated sharply. He had unusual allies in this, as Nedić and Ljotić also opposed them, in their case because the agreements tended to sideline them in favour of the Chetniks. In particular, Meyszner strongly opposed the further arming of the Chetniks led by Đurišić and Lukačević, on the grounds that they had not upheld their previous agreements and that the Croats, as well as Muslims in <a href="Albanian%20Kingdom%20%281943%E2%80%9344%29">Albania</a>, <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> and the <a href="Sand%C5%BEak">Sandžak</a>, had expressed concerns about any strengthening of the Chetniks. The commander of the Bulgarian <a href="1st%20Occupation%20Corps%20%28Bulgaria%29">1st Occupation Corps</a>, General <a href="Asen%20Nikoloff">Asen Nikoloff</a>, also opposed the agreements. Meyszner's increasing objections to the agreements coincided with growing Partisan pressure from the west and the advance of the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> from the east.

In April, Neubacher and the "Wehrmacht" managed to get rid of Meyszner. The catalyst for his recall was Meyszner's public criticism of Neubacher over reprisals, which Neubacher characterised as "undermining official discipline". Neubacher was assisted in this by Meyszner's old nemesis, Kaltenbrunner, who was now the chief of the RSHA. Even Schäfer was no longer able to work with Meyszner and supported Neubacher's campaign against his superior. Meyszner was replaced by "SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Polizei" <a href="Hermann%20Behrends">Hermann Behrends</a>, a <a href="Mentorship">protégé</a> of the assassinated head of the SD, "SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Polizei" <a href="Reinhard%20Heydrich">Reinhard Heydrich</a>. Immediately before his appointment, Behrends had been serving as an "SS-Sturmbannführer der Reserve" commanding a mountain artillery battalion in the <a href="13th%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Handschar%20%281st%20Croatian%29">13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian)</a>. In mid-May 1944, Meyszner was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class for his efforts fighting the Partisans in Serbia.

While Himmler agreed to relieve Meyszner as HSSPF for Serbia and Montenegro, he did this by transferring him to Berlin and appointing him as "Generalinspekteur der Gendarmerie und Schutzpolizei der Gemeinden" (General Inspector of the Gendarmerie and Schutzpolizei in the Reich) with the intention of establishing a Europe-wide gendarmerie. Nothing is known about Meyszner's activities in this role. At the end of the war, he fell into the hands of the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Western Allies</a> and his high SS rank ensured attention from investigators. He was interrogated by the <a href="Nuremberg%20trials">United States Chief Counsel for the Prosecution of Axis Criminality</a>, <a href="Robert%20H.%20Jackson">Robert H. Jackson</a>, in June 1945 and was placed into Yugoslav custody soon after. His involvement in the carrying out of reprisal executions both on his own account and on behalf of the "Wehrmacht", and the publication of his name along with lists of those executed, meant that his fate was certain.

As far as the killing of Jewish women and children is concerned, Meyszner's direct involvement is less clear. According to Moll, Schäfer claimed that he had received the orders and gas van directly from Berlin and had carried out the killings with little reference to Meyszner. Manoschek accepts Schäfer's assertion, stating that Schäfer also had an independent Gestapo chain of command, over which Meyszner had very limited control. Despite this, as HSSPF he was formally responsible for all his subordinates, including the Gestapo department that killed the Jewish women and children. He was also responsible for carrying out policies that saw 70,000 Serbs transported to the Reich as forced labourers, 4,000 of whom ended up in occupied Norway. <a href="The%20Holocaust%20in%20Serbia">The Holocaust in Serbia</a> played little part in his trial before the Supreme Military Court in Belgrade between 9 and 22 December 1946. On 22 December, he was sentenced to death, along with most of the 20 leading members of his HSSPF staff who were tried at the same time. On 24 January 1947, Meyszner was executed by hanging.

Tyrone W. "Ty" Garland (born August 13, 1992) is an American professional <a href="basketball">basketball</a> player for <a href="Brei%C3%B0ablik%20UBK">Breiðablik</a> of the <a href="First%20Division%20Men%20%28Icelandic%20basketball%29">First Division</a> in Iceland. A native of <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>, he joined the <a href="Mississauga%20Power">Mississauga Power</a> midway in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20NBL%20Canada%20season">2014–15 season</a>, a few months after completing his senior year at <a href="La%20Salle%20University">La Salle University</a>. He had several impactful performances with Mississauga in his rookie season and was awarded several starts. Garland primarily plays the <a href="point%20guard">point guard</a> position, but is known as an all-around guard.

Garland, whom <a href="Rivals.com">Rivals.com</a> and <a href="247Sports.com">247Sports.com</a> rated a three-star recruit coming out of high school, started out his collegiate career with <a href="Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20men%27s%20basketball">Virginia Tech</a> after being recruited by a number of <a href="Power%20Five%20conferences">high major</a> <a href="college%20basketball">college basketball</a> programs. However, after seeing very limited minutes from head coach <a href="Seth%20Greenberg">Seth Greenberg</a> during his first two seasons there, he transferred to <a href="La%20Salle%20Explorers%20men%27s%20basketball">La Salle</a> and started competing for the Explorers in late 2012. As a junior with his new team, he famously made a game-winning shot dubbed the "Southwest Philly Floater" in the <a href="2013%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">2013 NCAA Tournament</a>.

Before playing college basketball, Garland starred for <a href="John%20Bartram%20High%20School">John Bartram High School</a> in his hometown and was a first-team All-State selection and one of the top scorers in the history of the <a href="Philadelphia%20Public%20League">Philadelphia Public League</a> (PPL). In his time, he scored the third-most points by any player in the Public League, only being exceeded by Maureece Rice and <a href="Wilt%20Chamberlain">Wilt Chamberlain</a>. Garland is currently the fourth-best scorer in PPL history.

Garland was raised in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, by his mother, Audrey Tyler. He grew up on South Yewdall Street, near 54th Street and Greenway Avenue in <a href="Southwest%20Philadelphia">Southwest Philadelphia</a>'s <a href="Kingsessing%2C%20Philadelphia">Kingsessing</a> neighborhood. He attended middle school at Richard Allen Preparatory Charter School in the same area. His cousin Bernard Tyler, a former player at <a href="Overbrook%20High%20School%20%28Philadelphia%29">Overbrook High School</a> in Philadelphia, helped him learn a <a href="basketball%20moves">basketball move</a> known as the floater. Tyler told Garland to "just get it over the big man and leave it in God's hands".

Initially, Garland was enrolled at <a href="Delaware%20Valley%20High%20School%20%28private%20school%29">Delaware Valley Charter School</a>, which was located only half a mile from his future college, <a href="La%20Salle%20University">La Salle University</a>. However, his cousin Donnel Feaster, an alumnus of <a href="John%20Bartram%20High%20School">John Bartram High School</a>, recommended that Garland attend his alma mater. The team's head coach, James Brown, said, "I'm always telling my ex-players, 'If you see any good ones, send them my way'...Not that they listen. Don did, though. That's how I got Ty".

Garland ultimately enrolled at Bartram and played under Brown. A four-year <a href="varsity%20letter">letter winner</a>, he was promoted to team captain in his senior season and garnered several <a href="Philadelphia%20Public%20League">Philadelphia Public League</a> (PPL) accolades. In both his junior and senior years, the "<a href="Philadelphia%20Daily%20News">Philadelphia Daily News</a>" named Garland first-team All-City and the "<a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a>" named him a first-team All-State selection. He led Bartram in his last two seasons there, averaging 28.5 points and 25.1 points per game as a junior and senior respectively. The team went 73–35 in the years that Garland was with them, and he led them to a PPL championship appearance against Imhotep Institute Charter High School, where Bartram lost 48–56. He scored 32 points and 6 three-pointers, but his teammates were only 5-for-37 in their shot attempts.

In an earlier 2009 Class AAAA playoff contest vs <a href="Pocono%20Mountain%20School%20District%23East%20High%20School">Pocono Mountain East High School</a>, Garland scored eight consecutive points in the final 44 seconds of regulation. He capped the streak by making a 30-foot shot with 3.3 seconds remaining, and his 40 total points helped Bartram win, 72–67. Garland scored a total of 2,198 points, making him the top scorer in school history and the third-leading scorer in Public League history. Maureece Rice, who scored 2,681, and <a href="Wilt%20Chamberlain">Wilt Chamberlain</a>, who scored 2,206, were the only players who had accumulated more points in their high school careers in the league. <a href="Maurice%20Watson">Maurice Watson</a>, from the <a href="Boys%27%20Latin%20of%20Philadelphia%20Charter%20School">Boys' Latin of Philadelphia Charter School</a>, broke both Chamberlain's and Garland's records in 2012, pushing Garland to fourth on the list.
While in high school, Garland also played <a href="Amateur%20Athletic%20Union">Amateur Athletic Union</a> (AAU) basketball with the Philly Pride. Amauro Austin, a statistician for the "<a href="Philadelphia%20Daily%20News">Philadelphia Daily News</a>", directed the program while Garland was there. Austin commented, "Everybody liked Ty. Not one person didn't. He was loyal, honest; just a solid-gold individual. He didn't have a malicious bone in his body". Garland often slept during the day and stayed awake at night, leading his peers to think of him as a <a href="vampire">vampire</a>. Before becoming a senior, he led the Pride to sixth place at the under-17 national AAU tournament in <a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando, Florida</a>. The team finished with an 8–1 record due largely to Garland's contributions.

On July 9, 2009, Garland committed to play <a href="college%20basketball">college basketball</a> for the <a href="Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20men%27s%20basketball">Hokies</a> of <a href="Virginia%20Tech">Virginia Tech</a>. He announced his decision to attend the school at a press conference at the Reebok All-American Camp. Garland had also considered joining the programs at <a href="La%20Salle%20Explorers%20men%27s%20basketball">La Salle</a>, <a href="Nebraska%20Cornhuskers%20men%27s%20basketball">Nebraska</a>, <a href="Temple%20Owls%20men%27s%20basketball">Temple</a>, <a href="St.%20Bonaventure%20Bonnies%20men%27s%20basketball">St. Bonaventure</a>, <a href="Maryland%20Terrapins%20men%27s%20basketball">Maryland</a>, <a href="Seton%20Hall%20Pirates%20men%27s%20basketball">Seton Hall</a>, <a href="Providence%20Friars%20men%27s%20basketball">Providence</a>, and <a href="Butler%20Bulldogs%20men%27s%20basketball">Butler</a>. <a href="La%20Salle%20University">La Salle University</a> is based in Garland's hometown of Philadelphia and its head coach, <a href="John%20Giannini">John Giannini</a>, recruited him especially hard out of high school. His old coach at John Bartram High School, James Brown, supported his commitment to Virginia Tech. Assistant coach <a href="James%20Johnson%20%28basketball%2C%20born%201971%29">James Johnson</a> was the man primarily responsible for recruiting Garland. <a href="Rivals.com">Rivals.com</a> rated the <a href="point%20guard">point guard</a> a three-star recruit, and <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> ranked him as the 31st-best player of his position in the Class of 2010. Garland officially signed a <a href="National%20Letter%20of%20Intent">National Letter of Intent</a> with the team on February 3, 2010 and enrolled at Virginia Tech on June 30. Garland would play his freshman season for a <a href="Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20men%27s%20basketball">Virginia Tech Hokies</a> team that had a large part of its scoring coming from <a href="Malcolm%20Delaney">Malcolm Delaney</a>, Jeff Allen, and Dorenzo Hudson in the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2009–10 season</a>. Delaney, their leading scorer, chose to withdraw from the <a href="2010%20NBA%20draft">2010 NBA draft</a> in May 2010 and returned for another season with the Hokies. Garland weighed approximately 170 lbs (77 kg) entering college, and because of his <a href="shooting%20guard">shooting guard</a> qualities, he was not as highly rated as some of the team's other 2010 recruits, like <a href="Jarell%20Eddie">Jarell Eddie</a>.

On November 12, 2010, Garland made his career debut with Virginia Tech against the <a href="Campbell%20Fighting%20Camels%20basketball">Campbell Fighting Camels</a>, seeing one minute of playing time on the court and going 0-of-1 from the field. However, the Hokies easily won the game, 70–60. Garland scored his first points as a Hokie on November 26, vs <a href="Oklahoma%20State%20Cowboys%20basketball">Oklahoma State</a>, putting up 6 in spite of very limited playing time. He was allowed to play more than 20 minutes for the first time in his collegiate career against <a href="Mount%20St.%20Mary%27s%20Mountaineers%20men%27s%20basketball">Mount St. Mary's</a>. The opposing team was easily defeated, 99–34. Seven of the ten Hokies that appeared throughout the contest played more than 20 minutes, and Garland–who recorded 16 points–was one of five to score double digits. It would be his season-high performance and also the only time he scored more than 10 points as a freshman. On March 16, 2011, Garland played a career-high 23 minutes vs <a href="Bethune-Cookman%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball">Bethune-Cookman</a> in the first round of the <a href="2011%20National%20Invitation%20Tournament">2011</a> <a href="National%20Invitational%20Tournament">National Invitational Tournament</a> (NIT), recording seven points and having perfect free throw shooting. In 6.8 minutes per game in his first season, he averaged 2.8 points, 0.3 rebounds, and 0.5 assists.

Entering the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20men%27s%20basketball%20season">2011–12 season</a>, the Hokies lost star Malcolm Delaney, who signed a conditional one-year contract with the <a href="LNB%20Pro%20A">French</a> professional basketball team <a href="%C3%89lan%20Chalon">Élan Chalon</a> following his senior year. Garland debuted as a sophomore on November 12, 2011 against <a href="East%20Tennessee%20State%20Buccaneers%20basketball">East Tennessee State</a>, making his first-ever start at the collegiate level due to the absence of <a href="Erick%20Green">Erick Green</a>. He played 24 minutes throughout the game, recording 13 points, 3 assists, and 2 steals. In Tech's next contest with <a href="Monmouth%20Hawks%20men%27s%20basketball">Monmouth</a>, Garland scored a career-high 18 points off the bench, shooting 7-for-7 from the field.

However, as the season progressed, head coach <a href="Seth%20Greenberg">Seth Greenberg</a> began giving Garland fewer minutes. Following the recovery of freshman Marquis Rankin from a <a href="Tear%20of%20meniscus">torn meniscus</a>, Garland played a total of one minute in three games. He also scored a combined six points following his initial two performances that season. On December 11, 2011, Garland did not even remove his warm-up shirt in his team's game vs <a href="Norfolk%20State%20Spartans%20men%27s%20basketball">Norfolk State</a>. When Greenberg was asked about Garland's playing time, the coach said, "Marquis [Rankin] is right now a good play-starter and good on ball defender. We've got to get other guys more minutes". When asked a similar question the day before, he said that "you can't play 13 guys". On December 16, 2011, Garland announced on <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> that he was planning to transfer out of Virginia Tech. Following his exams, he returned to his hometown of <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. Garland became the third men's basketball player to transfer out of the Hokies' team in the past academic year, following the footsteps of Ben Boggs, who moved to <a href="Valparaiso%20Crusaders%20men%27s%20basketball">Valparaiso</a>, and Manny Atkins, who would end up with <a href="Georgia%20State%20Panthers%20men%27s%20basketball">Georgia State</a>. Garland finished his sophomore year at Virginia Tech averaging 4.6 points, 1.3 assists, and 1.3 turnovers in eight appearances. In late December 2011, he began competing for <a href="La%20Salle%20Explorers%20men%27s%20basketball">La Salle</a>. Explorers head coach <a href="John%20Giannini">John Giannini</a> said, "We recruited Tyrone extremely hard out of high school. He is known as a scorer and can also be a very good passer and defender. He is the type of all-around guard, talent and person that will make our team better. He gives us an experienced player to continue our growth over the next 2 years. With his addition we will have tremendous team quickness and depth." Several of the team's top scorers in <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20La%20Salle%20Explorers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2011–12</a> had experience playing high school basketball in the <a href="Philadelphia%20Public%20League">Philadelphia Public</a> and <a href="Philadelphia%20Catholic%20League">Catholic Leagues</a>.

Following his transfer, Garland opened his stint with La Salle on December 15, 2012 in a road game against <a href="Bucknell%20Bison%20men%27s%20basketball">Bucknell</a>, scoring 9 points in 22 minutes off the bench and recording 2 turnovers and 4 personal fouls. He did not take part in the team's earlier games because he was ineligible due to NCAA regulations regarding player transfers. In the game that followed, he posted a career-best 26 points as a bench player in a win over <a href="Iona%20Gaels%20men%27s%20basketball">Iona</a>. He also added 3 rebounds, an assist, and a steal in the 23 minutes he was on the court. In a seven-minute stretch in the second half, Garland scored 14 straight points. He said after the game, "I used to do it in high school. It kind of felt like high school when I was out there; it just felt good". Garland, who led the Explorers in scoring, also received praise from head coach <a href="John%20Giannini">John Giannini</a>. On December 22, 2012, he had another impactful performance vs <a href="Sacred%20Heart%20Pioneers%20men%27s%20basketball">Sacred Heart</a>, with six assists in 31 minutes of play. This was also his first-ever start under Giannini. The coach commented about Garland, "He's a very underrated passer. People think because he scored all those points in high school he's a scorer first and foremost. I think he's a very good passer". However, this would be his sole start in his junior year at La Salle. Garland was effective in the opening, <a href="NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Opening%20Round%20game">First Four</a> round of the <a href="2013%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament</a> against <a href="Boise%20State%20Broncos%20men%27s%20basketball">Boise State</a>, finishing with a team-high 22 points and, in turn, scoring 20 or more points for the second time as a junior. After the game, Giannini told Garland, "This is why I chased you all over the place, to win NCAA tournament games and see if you could be a great player". On March 23, 2014, against the <a href="Ole%20Miss%20Rebels%20men%27s%20basketball">Ole Miss Rebels</a>, Garland made a scooping layup off the <a href="Backboard%20%28basketball%29">backboard</a> with 2.5 seconds left in regulation to send La Salle into the Sweet 16 round of the <a href="2013%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament</a>. The game-winner was known as the "Southwest Philly Floater," following Garland's post-game comments, in which he said, "That's the Southwest Philly Floater, man. Shoutout to my Cousin Bern, shoutout to my Mom". He made the shot in spite of defensive efforts from the Rebels' 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m) <a href="center%20%28basketball%29">center</a> Reginald Buckner, who had blocked the Explorer multiple times in the game. Garland recalled the play, saying, "Time was running out, and I felt like I could get the drive. When I cut, I just saw an opening and took the ball up...I went in there and knew if I could get an open shot, I could make it". Following a defeat to <a href="Wichita%20State%20Shockers%20men%27s%20basketball">Wichita State</a> that ended the team's tournament run and their season, Garland was averaging 13.1 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 2 assists.
Garland entered the season as one of four seniors on La Salle's men's basketball roster. Ramon Galloway, who led the team in scoring in <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20La%20Salle%20Explorers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2012–13</a>, graduated the previous year. Garland debuted as a senior in an exhibition game vs <a href="Indiana%20University%20of%20Pennsylvania">Indiana University of Pennsylvania</a> on November 2, 2013, scoring 16 points on .500 shooting. He made his first official appearance in a double-overtime home contest against <a href="Manhattan%20Jaspers%20basketball">Manhattan</a>. Garland led a 13–3 run, highlighted by two key shots, that forced overtime. He made a three-pointer with minutes left in the game, but his team ran out of time before they could rally. Nevertheless, Garland scored a career-high 28 points, hitting 12 free throws. He had an effective second game as well. Against <a href="Quinnipiac%20Bobcats%20men%27s%20basketball">Quinnipiac</a> at the <a href="ESPN%20College%20Basketball">ESPN Tip-Off Marathon</a>, despite scoring far fewer points, his last-minute rebound was instrumental to the Explorers' victory. Head coach John Giannini said, "He had zero rebounds in 44 minutes against Manhattan. The rebound that really iced the game today was a defensive rebound by Tyrone. Sometimes you don't play well, you don't do something, and then you learn from it and do better, so I am pleased with him". The guard had another notable performance on November 22, 2013, against <a href="Morgan%20State%20Bears%20men%27s%20basketball">Morgan State</a>, when he led both teams with 25 points. He also added four three-pointers. On January 25, 2014, Garland notched a career-best 30 points vs <a href="VCU%20Rams%20men%27s%20basketball">VCU</a>. His team's 10-point <a href="2014%20Atlantic%2010%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">2014 Atlantic 10 Tournament</a> loss to <a href="St.%20Bonaventure%20Bonnies%20men%27s%20basketball">St. Bonaventure</a>, in which he contributed 0 points in 30 minutes, marked the end of his collegiate career. He finished the season averaging 12.6 points, 2.3 rebounds, 2.6 assists, and 0.7 steals. Garland, Sam Mills, <a href="Tyreek%20Duren">Tyreek Duren</a>, and Taylor Dunn, recorded the most wins for a single senior class at La Salle in 22 years.

Following his graduation from La Salle University, Garland signed with the sports agent Gilad Berkowitz from Berkowitz Career Ventures. Berkowitz, a law student at <a href="Duke%20University">Duke University</a>, was certified with the <a href="National%20Basketball%20Players%20Association">National Basketball Players Association</a> but was only two years older than his client. The agent said, "What he has to overcome is his size and range and I have to overcome my age. We are going to market ourselves to NBA teams". Garland's connections with Berkowitz helped him get to know trainer Kendrick Williams and get an endorsement deal with <a href="Under%20Armour">Under Armour</a>. He had hopes of playing in the <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">National Basketball Association</a> (NBA), regardless of whether he had to compete in Europe before reaching that level. In mid-October 2014, Garland planned on entering the <a href="2014%20NBA%20Development%20League%20Draft">2014 NBA Development League Draft</a>. However, on November 16, he agreed to terms with <a href="ETHA%20Engomis">Michelin Etha Engomis Nicosia</a> of the <a href="Cyprus%20Basketball%20Division%201">Cyprus Basketball Division 1</a>, but would not make an official appearance for them.

On January 14, 2015, after placing one of their players, <a href="Mike%20Allison%20%28basketball%29">Mike Allison</a>, on the injury reserve list, the <a href="Mississauga%20Power">Mississauga Power</a> of the <a href="National%20Basketball%20League%20of%20Canada">National Basketball League of Canada</a> (NBL) signed and activated Garland. On January 15, 2015, he made his professional debut for the Power against the <a href="Brampton%20A%27s">Brampton A's</a>, recording 18 points, 6 rebounds, and 6 assists and being named Peak Performer of the Game. The opposing team won the game with a score of 101–90. Garland had another impact performance on January 22, 2015 against the <a href="Halifax%20Rainmen">Halifax Rainmen</a>, as he scored 26 points, grabbed 5 rebounds, and recorded 7 assists, leading Mississauga to a victory. In an overtime loss to the <a href="Windsor%20Express">Windsor Express</a> on February 17, he scored 20 or more points for the second time that season, notching 23. He made two key three-pointers in the closing minutes. On February 28, in Mississauga's regular season finale vs the <a href="London%20Lightning">London Lightning</a>, Garland recorded a season-high 31 points. He finished his rookie season averaging 12.9 points, 4.1 assists, and 1.3 steals. He started in 12 of his 16 appearances. In late June 2015, the Mississauga Power folded after the creation of the <a href="NBA%20Development%20League">NBA Development League</a> affiliate for the <a href="Toronto%20Raptors">Toronto Raptors</a>, known as <a href="Raptors%20905">Raptors 905</a>. The Power's rights were purchased by <a href="Maple%20Leaf%20Sports%20%26amp%3B%20Entertainment">Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment</a> (MLSE) and their home court, the <a href="Paramount%20Fine%20Foods%20Centre">Hershey Centre</a>, became the venue for Raptors 905 games. The move ended Garland's stint with Mississauga. He would not join Raptors 905, as it had no connections with the Power players and was merely a development team for the Toronto Raptors. As of late 2015, Garland is not signed to any team.

On April 25, 2016, Garland signed with <a href="Brei%C3%B0ablik%20UBK">Breiðablik UBK</a> of the <a href="First%20Division%20Men%20%28Icelandic%20basketball%29">First Division</a> in Iceland. He scored 43 points and recorded nine steals vs. Valur on October 14. Garland nearly had a quadruple-double on October 27, putting up 37 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, and nine steals to beat <a href="FSu%20Selfoss%20basketball">FSu Selfoss</a>.

As a <a href="freshman">freshman</a> at <a href="Virginia%20Tech">Virginia Tech</a>, Garland was named to the 2011 All-<a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a> (ACC) Academic Team along with <a href="Kyle%20Singler">Kyle Singler</a>, <a href="Mason%20Plumlee">Mason Plumlee</a>, <a href="Ryan%20Kelly%20%28basketball%29">Ryan Kelly</a>, and <a href="Tyler%20Zeller">Tyler Zeller</a>. He earned a <a href="Grading%20%28education%29">grade-point average</a> of above 3.00 for the previous semester and maintained it as a cumulative average through his academic career. He was also one of 2,835 student-athletes recognized by the ACC on its 2010–11 Academic Honor Roll. Garland majored in university studies at Virginia Tech, but majored in <a href="sociology">sociology</a> at La Salle University. He recalled the final months of his senior year at La Salle, saying, "I was really focused on graduating school and locking down my grades for graduation. I was focused on the next step, but I had to graduate school. That degree is very big to me. I told my mom I was going to graduate college and I just wanted to put that smile on her face".

In the summer of 2015, Garland participated in <a href="The%20Basketball%20Tournament">The Basketball Tournament</a> (TBT), a five-on-five, <a href="single-elimination%20tournament">single-elimination</a> basketball <a href="tournament">tournament</a> in which the winner out of the 96 teams wins a total of $1 million. He competed for a team made up of former La Salle men's basketball players, called 20th & Olney, reuniting with Ramon Galloway, Steve Zack, and Tyreek Duren. Explorers video coordinator Andrew McGlynn, who acted as the team's general manager and coach, said, "The main reason [for entering] is how close the program is here. [Coach Dr. John Giannini] has done such a good job of making it a family atmosphere around here". Garland was one of 50 players with NBL Canada experience that were playing in TBT. On July 18, 2015 at <a href="Philadelphia%20University">Philadelphia University</a>, he debuted with 22 points in a win over Max's All Stars, a team led by <a href="Dominique%20Jones">Dominique Jones</a>. 20th & Olney lost in the next round to Boeheim's Army, which was led by <a href="Hakim%20Warrick">Hakim Warrick</a> and <a href="Olu%20Famutimi">Olu Famutimi</a>, as Garland notched 21 points.

Villanova guard <a href="Mikal%20Bridges">Mikal Bridges</a> is Garland's second cousin. Garland is a fan of Villanova and roots for Bridges.

<doc id="46858464" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46858464" title="Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed">
Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed

Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed, occasionally formerly known as The Imprudence of Candaules, is a <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> on canvas by English artist <a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a>, first exhibited at the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a> in 1830. It shows a scene from the "<a href="Histories%20%28Herodotus%29">Histories</a>" by <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, in which <a href="Candaules">Candaules</a>, king of <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a>, invites his bodyguard <a href="Gyges%20of%20Lydia">Gyges</a> to hide in the couple's bedroom and watch his wife Nyssia undress, to prove to him her beauty. Nyssia notices Gyges spying and challenges him to either accept his own execution or to kill Candaules as a punishment. Gyges chooses to kill Candaules and take his place as king. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia, still unaware that she is being watched by anyone other than her husband, removes the last of her clothes.

Etty hoped that his audience would take from the painting the moral lesson that women are not chattels and that men infringing on their rights should justly be punished, but he made little effort to explain this to audiences. The painting was immediately controversial and perceived as a cynical combination of a pornographic image and a violent and unpleasant narrative, and it was condemned as an immoral piece of the type one would expect from a foreign, not a British, artist. It was bought by <a href="Robert%20Vernon%20%28art%20patron%29">Robert Vernon</a> on its exhibition, and in 1847 was one of a number of paintings given by Vernon to the nation. The work retained its controversial reputation in later years, and when "<a href="The%20Art%20Journal">The Art Journal</a>" bought the reproduction rights to Vernon's former collection in 1849 they did not distribute reproductions of "Candaules". In 1929 it was among several paintings transferred to the newly expanded <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a>, where it remains.

<a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a> (1787–1849), the seventh son of a <a href="York">York</a> baker and miller, had originally been an apprentice printer in <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>, but on completing his seven-year apprenticeship at the age of 18 moved to <a href="London">London</a> to become an artist. Strongly influenced by the works of <a href="Titian">Titian</a> and <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Rubens</a>, he submitted a number of paintings to the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts">Royal Academy of Arts</a> and the <a href="British%20Institution">British Institution</a>, all of which were either rejected outright or drew little attention when exhibited. In 1821 he finally achieved recognition when the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of his works, "<a href="The%20Arrival%20of%20Cleopatra%20in%20Cilicia">The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia</a>" (also known as "The Triumph of Cleopatra"). "Cleopatra" was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts%23Membership">Royal Academician</a> in 1828, beating <a href="John%20Constable">John Constable</a> to the position. 

Following the success of "Cleopatra", over the next decade, Etty tried to replicate its success by painting <a href="Nude%20%28art%29">nude figures</a> in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 depicted nude figures. While some nude paintings by foreign artists existed in private collections, England had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Suppression%20of%20Vice">Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice</a>. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in nude studies, and although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received, many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent.

"Candaules" depicts a scene from the first book of the "<a href="Histories%20%28Herodotus%29">Histories</a>" by <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>. <a href="Candaules">Candaules</a>, ruler of the ancient kingdom of <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a>, believed his wife Nyssia to be the world's most beautiful woman. He discussed his wife's beauty with his favourite bodyguard <a href="Gyges%20of%20Lydia">Gyges</a>, but felt Gyges was lying when he told him that he agreed about her beauty. Candaules arranged, over the protests of Gyges, for Gyges to hide behind his bedroom door and secretly watch Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Although he was unhappy at being forced to take part, Gyges reluctantly hid behind the door and watched Nyssia undress. Nyssia noticed Gyges as he slipped out of the room afterwards, but remained silent.

The next day, Nyssia summoned Gyges and condemned him for his breach of custom in spying on her naked. Gyges was given the choice of killing Candaules for his instigation of the plot, or of voluntarily accepting his own execution; he reluctantly chose to save his own life by murdering his master. The next night, Gyges hid behind the same door from which he had watched the naked Nyssia, and stabbed Candaules while he slept, taking Nyssia as his own wife and declaring himself King of Lydia. The <a href="Pythia">Delphic Oracle</a> confirmed Gyges as king, as the first of the <a href="Mermnadae">Mermnad</a> dynasty, and he reigned for 38 years.

Etty's "Candaules" shows the moment at which Gyges, hiding behind the door, first catches sight of Nyssia's naked body. Candaules lies naked in bed, while Nyssia undresses as she prepares to join him, and Gyges tiptoes around the door to catch a glimpse of her. Nyssia holds a piece of fabric, which forms a vertical line cutting off the body of Candaules at the top of his legs, invoking a theme of emasculation at the hands of a powerful woman. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge. The cluttered arrangement of drapery and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.

Etty was a regular attender at the Royal Academy's <a href="life%20class">life class</a> throughout his career. Nyssia stands in a pose which Etty had sketched many times, that of a woman with her knee on a raised plinth and one arm raised holding a hanging rope. (Throughout his career Etty had difficulty painting arms, and generally showed his subjects holding their arms away from their body to expose as much of their torso as possible.) It is possible that Etty intentionally chose the obscure subject of the painting as a pretext to paint a woman in this pose. The picture is painted with an emphasis on colour and texture; as with many Etty works the female figure is painted in more detail than the rest of the canvas, and it is likely Etty painted Nyssia directly from a life model, completing the rest of the composition later in a studio.

"Candaules" was completed and exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1830. Etty felt that the moral lesson of the story was that women were not the chattels of men and that if men—even their husbands—violated a woman's rights she was within her rights to punish them. However, he made little effort to explain what was, at the time, an unconventional view, instead allowing viewers to form their own judgement of the piece. Thus, unusually for a painting of the time, "Candaules" appears morally highly ambiguous, inviting the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges.

From its unveiling, "Candaules" was condemned by the press as a cynical combination of a pornographic picture and a violent and unpleasant narrative, and there was near-unanimous consensus that the picture was inappropriate for public exhibition. The "<a href="Literary%20Gazette">Literary Gazette</a>" condemned the work as "against decency and good taste", and Etty as tending in "Candaules" towards the type of "debasing sensuality" one would expect from a foreigner, not the "purer" British school of painting. The reviewer also criticised the theme of the painting, saying that "as an academic study, the central figure of this group might be admissible; but, in with the disgraceful story, it deserves to be warmly reprehended". "<a href="La%20Belle%20Assembl%C3%A9e">La Belle Assemblée</a>", one of Britain's most influential <a href="women%27s%20magazine">women's magazine</a>s, praised Etty's other exhibits at the <a href="Summer%20Exhibition">Summer Exhibition</a> but refused to review "Candaules" altogether, saying that "to us the subject is so offensive that we pass it over". Even <a href="Alexander%20Gilchrist">Alexander Gilchrist</a>, generally one of Etty's strongest supporters, in his 1855 biography of Etty described "Candaules" as "almost the only instance among Etty's works, of an undeniably disagreeable, not to say objectionable subject", while Sarah Burnage of the University of York wrote in 2011 that "it is perhaps hard to see the painting as anything but a deliberate attempt by the artist to shock and scandalise".

Despite the hostility with which "Candaules" was met on its exhibition, it was bought by <a href="Robert%20Vernon%20%28art%20patron%29">Robert Vernon</a>, who had made a fortune supplying horses to the military and was using the proceeds to amass a major art collection. Vernon presented his collection to the nation in 1847, although in the case of "Candaules" a painting so controversial becoming government property was a source of some embarrassment. In 1929 "Candaules" was transferred to the newly expanded <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a>, where it remains.

The condemnation with which "Candaules" was met meant it remained a controversial piece. When <a href="Samuel%20Carter%20Hall">Samuel Carter Hall</a> was choosing works to illustrate his newly launched "<a href="The%20Art%20Journal">The Art Journal</a>", he considered it important to promote new British artists, even if it meant illustrations which some readers considered pornographic or offensive. In 1849 Hall secured reproduction rights to the 157 paintings which Vernon had given to the nation but declined to distribute reproductions of "Candaules", despite his willingness to publish reproductions of other provocative Etty nudes such as "Female Bathers Surprised by a Swan".

Shortly after "Candaules" was exhibited Etty, needled by repeated attacks from the press on his supposed tastelessness, indecency and lack of creativity, decided to produce an explicitly moral piece. The result was his 1832 "<a href="The%20Destroying%20Angel%20and%20Daemons%20of%20Evil%20Interrupting%20the%20Orgies%20of%20the%20Vicious%20and%20Intemperate">The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate</a>", which was seen by many as a renunciation of his earlier, more openly sensual works. Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes, but from 1832 onwards made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons. Despite this he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by many, long after his death in 1849; as late as 1882 "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28British%20magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>" was able to comment, "I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing." 

Interest in Etty declined after his death as <a href="Victorian%20painting">new movements</a>, particularly the <a href="Pre-Raphaelite%20Brotherhood">Pre-Raphaelites</a> and <a href="Aestheticism">Aestheticism</a>, came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. Very few subsequent artists have been influenced by Etty, and one of the few later works on which "Candaules" can be considered an influence is "The Knight Errant", painted by <a href="John%20Everett%20Millais">John Everett Millais</a> in 1870, which depicted the rescue of a distraught woman who has been stripped and tied to a tree. "The Knight Errant" was a return to the style developed by Etty in "Candaules" of forcing the viewer to feel complicity in witnessing the sexual degradation of a woman, and, particularly in early versions in which the woman's face was visible, attracted similar criticism.

Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm

Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm (also known as Fair Laughs the Morn and Youth and Pleasure) is an <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> on canvas by English artist <a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a>, first exhibited in 1832 and currently in <a href="Tate%20Britain">Tate Britain</a>. Etty had been planning the painting since 1818–19, and an early version was exhibited in 1822. The piece was inspired by a metaphor in <a href="Thomas%20Gray">Thomas Gray</a>'s poem "<a href="The%20Bard%20%28poem%29">The Bard</a>" in which the apparently bright start to the notorious misrule of <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20England">Richard II of England</a> was compared to a gilded ship whose occupants are unaware of an approaching storm. Etty chose to illustrate Gray's lines literally, depicting a golden boat filled with and surrounded by nude and near-nude figures.

Etty felt that his approach to the work illustrated a moral warning about the pursuit of pleasure, but his approach was not entirely successful. "The Bard" was about a supposed curse on the <a href="House%20of%20Plantagenet">House of Plantagenet</a> placed by a Welsh <a href="bard">bard</a> following <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I of England</a>'s attempts to eradicate Welsh culture, and critics felt that Etty had somewhat misunderstood the point of Gray's poem. Some reviewers greatly praised the piece, and in particular Etty's technical abilities, but audiences of the time found it hard to understand the purpose of Etty's painting, and his use of nude figures led some critics to consider the work tasteless and offensive.

The painting was bought in 1832 by <a href="Robert%20Vernon%20%28art%20patron%29">Robert Vernon</a> to form part of his collection of British art. Vernon donated his collection, including "Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm", to the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a> in 1847, which, in turn, transferred it to the <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a> in 1949. It remains one of Etty's best-known works, and formed part of major exhibitions at Tate Britain in 2001–02 and at the <a href="York%20Art%20Gallery">York Art Gallery</a> in 2011–12.

<a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a>, the seventh son of a <a href="York">York</a> baker and miller, had been an apprentice printer in <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>. On completing his seven-year apprenticeship at the age of 18 he moved to London "with a few pieces of chalk crayons", and the intention of becoming a <a href="history%20painting">history painter</a> in the tradition of the <a href="Old%20Masters">Old Masters</a>. He enrolled in the Schools of the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts">Royal Academy of Arts</a>, studying under renowned portrait painter <a href="Thomas%20Lawrence">Thomas Lawrence</a>. He submitted numerous paintings to the Royal Academy over the following decade, all of which were either rejected or received little attention when exhibited.

In 1821 Etty's "<a href="The%20Arrival%20of%20Cleopatra%20in%20Cilicia">The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia</a>" (also known as "The Triumph of Cleopatra") was a critical success. The painting featured <a href="Nude%20%28art%29">nude figures</a>, and over the following years Etty painted further nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited in the 1820s included at least one nude figure.

While some nudes existed in private collections, England had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Suppression%20of%20Vice">Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice</a>. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and the reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received, many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent.

"Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm" was inspired by a passage in <a href="Thomas%20Gray">Thomas Gray</a>'s poem "<a href="The%20Bard%20%28poem%29">The Bard</a>". The theme of "The Bard" was the English king <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I</a>'s conquest of Wales, and a curse placed by a Welsh <a href="bard">bard</a> upon Edward's descendants after he ordered the execution of all bards and the eradication of Welsh culture. Etty used a passage Gray intended to symbolise the seemingly bright start to the disastrous reign of Edward's great-great-grandson <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20England">Richard II</a>.

Etty chose to illustrate Gray's words literally, creating what has been described as "a poetic romance". "Youth and Pleasure" depicts a small gilded boat. Above the boat, a nude figure representing <a href="west%20wind">Zephyr</a> blows on the sails. Another nude representing Pleasure lies on a large bouquet of flowers, loosely holding the <a href="Tiller">helm</a> of the boat and allowing Zephyr's breeze to guide it. A nude child blows bubbles, which another nude on the <a href="prow">prow</a> of the ship, representing Youth, reaches to catch. <a href="Naiad">Naiad</a>s, again nude, swim around and clamber on the boat. Although the seas are calm, a "sweeping whirlwind" is forming on the horizon, with a demonic figure within the storm clouds. (Deterioration and restoration means this demonic figure is now barely visible.) The intertwined limbs of the participants were intended to evoke the sensation of transient and passing pleasure, and to express the themes of female sexual appetites entrapping innocent youth, and the sexual power women hold over men.

Etty said of his approach to the text that he was hoping to create "a general allegory of Human Life, its empty vain pleasures—if not founded on the laws of Him who is the Rock of Ages." While Etty felt that the work conveyed a clear moral warning about the pursuit of pleasure, this lesson was largely lost upon its audiences.

When Etty exhibited the completed painting at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20Summer%20Exhibition">Royal Academy Summer Exhibition</a> in 1832, it was shown untitled, with the relevant six lines from "The Bard" attached; writers at the time sometimes referred to it by its <a href="incipit">incipit</a> of "Fair Laughs the Morn". By the time of Etty's death in 1849, it had acquired its present title of "Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm".

The final version of "Youth and Pleasure" was painted between 1830 and 1832, but Etty had been contemplating a painting on the theme since 1818–19. In 1822 he had exhibited an early version at the <a href="British%20Institution">British Institution</a> titled "A Sketch from One of Gray's Odes (Youth on the Prow)"; in this version the group of figures on the prow is reversed, and the swimmers around the boat are absent. Another rough version of the painting also survives, similar to the 1832 version but again with the figures on the prow reversed. This version was exhibited at a retrospective of Etty's work at the <a href="Society%20of%20Arts">Society of Arts</a> in 1849; it is dated 1848 but this is likely to be a misprint of 1828, making it a preliminary study for the 1832 painting.

Although it received little notice when first exhibited, the 1822 version provoked a strong reaction from "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>":

An <a href="oil%20sketch">oil sketch</a> attributed to Etty, given to York Art Gallery in 1952 by <a href="Judith%20Hare%2C%20Countess%20of%20Listowel">Judith Hare, Countess of Listowel</a> and entitled "Three Female Nudes", is possibly a preliminary study by Etty for "Youth and Pleasure", or a copy by a student of the three central figures. Art historian Sarah Burnage considers both possibilities unlikely, as neither the arrangement of figures, the subject matter or the <a href="sea%20serpent">sea serpent</a> approaching the group appear to relate to the completed "Youth and Pleasure", and considers it more likely to be a preliminary sketch for a now-unknown work.

"Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm" met with a mixed reception on exhibition, and while critics generally praised Etty's technical ability, there was a certain confusion as to what the painting was actually intended to represent and a general feeling that he had seriously misunderstood what "The Bard" was actually about. "The Library of the Fine Arts" felt "in classical design, anatomical drawing, elegance of attitude, fineness of form, and gracefulness of grouping, no doubt Mr. Etty has no superior", and while "the representation of the ideas in the lines quoted [from "The Bard"] are beautifully and accurately expressed upon the canvas" they considered "the ulterior reference of the poet [to the destruction of Welsh culture and the decline of the <a href="House%20of%20Plantagenet">House of Plantagenet</a>] was entirely lost sight of, and that, if this be the nearest that Art can approach in conveying to the eye the happy exemplification of the subject which Gray intended, we fear we must give up the contest upon the merits of poetry and painting." Similar concerns were raised in "The Times", which observed that it was "Full of beauty, rich in colouring, boldly and accurately drawn, and composed with a most graceful fancy; but the meaning of it, if it has any meaning, no man can tell", pointing out that although it was intended to illustrate Gray it "would represent almost as well any other poet's fancies." "<a href="The%20Examiner%20%281808%E2%80%9386%29">The Examiner</a>", meanwhile, took issue with the cramped and overladen boat, pointing out that the characters "if not exactly jammed together like figs in a basket, are sadly constrained for want of room", and also complained that the boat would not in reality "float half the weight which is made to press upon it."

Other reviewers were kinder; "<a href="The%20Gentleman%27s%20Magazine">The Gentleman's Magazine</a>" praised Etty's ability to capture "the beauty of the proportion of the antique", noting that in the central figures "there is far more of classicality than is to be seen in almost any modern picture", and considered the overall composition "a most fortunate combination of the ideality of Poetry and the reality of Nature". The "<a href="Athenaeum%20%28British%20magazine%29">Athenæum</a>" considered it "a poetic picture from a very poetic passage", praising Etty for "telling a story which is very difficult to tell with the pencil".

The greatest criticism of "Youth and Pleasure" came from "<a href="The%20Morning%20Chronicle">The Morning Chronicle</a>", a newspaper which had long disliked Etty's female nudes. It complained "no decent family can hang such sights against their wall", and condemned the painting as an "indulgence of what we once hoped a classical, but which are now convinced, is a lascivious mind", commenting "the course of [Etty's] studies should run in a purer channel, and that he should not persist, with an unhallowed fancy, to pursue Nature to her holy recesses. He is a laborious draughtsman, and a beautiful colourist; but he has not taste or chastity of mind enough to venture on the naked truth." The reviewer added "we fear that Mr. E will never turn from his wicked ways, and make himself fit for decent company."

"Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm" was purchased at the time of its exhibition by <a href="Robert%20Vernon%20%28art%20patron%29">Robert Vernon</a> for his important collection of British art. (The price Vernon paid for "Youth and Pleasure" is not recorded, although Etty's cashbook records a partial payment of £250—about £ in 2019 terms—so it is likely to have been a substantial sum.) Vernon later purchased <a href="John%20Constable">John Constable</a>'s "The Valley Farm", planning to hang it in the place then occupied by "Youth and Pleasure". This decision caused Constable to comment "My picture is to go into the place—where Etty's "<a href="Bumboat">Bumboat</a>" is at present—his picture with its precious freight is to be brought down nearer to the nose." Vernon presented his collection to the nation in 1847, and his 157 paintings, including "Youth and Pleasure", entered the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a>.

When <a href="Samuel%20Carter%20Hall">Samuel Carter Hall</a> was choosing works to illustrate his newly launched "<a href="The%20Art%20Journal">The Art Journal</a>", he considered it important to promote new British artists, even if it meant illustrations which some readers considered pornographic or offensive. In 1849 Hall secured reproduction rights to the paintings Vernon had given to the nation and soon published and widely distributed an engraving of the painting under the title "Youth and Pleasure", describing it as "of the very highest class".

Needled by repeated attacks from the press on his supposed indecency, poor taste and lack of creativity, Etty changed his approach after the response to "Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm". He exhibited over 80 further paintings at the Royal Academy alone, and remained a prominent painter of nudes, but from this time made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons. He died in November 1849 and, while his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity, interest in him declined over time, and by the end of the 19th century all of his paintings had fallen below their original prices.

In 1949 the painting was transferred from the National Gallery to the <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a>, where it remains. Although "Youth and Pleasure" is one of Etty's best-known paintings, it remains controversial, and Dennis Farr's 1958 biography of Etty describes it as "singularly inept". It was one of five works by Etty chosen for <a href="Tate%20Britain">Tate Britain</a>'s landmark "Exposed: The Victorian Nude" exhibition in 2001–02, and also formed part of a major retrospective of Etty's work at the <a href="York%20Art%20Gallery">York Art Gallery</a> in 2011–12.

1951 Philadelphia municipal election

<a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>'s <a href="municipal%20election">municipal election</a> held on November 6, 1951, was the first under the city's new charter, which had been approved by the voters in April, and the first <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> victory in the city in more than a half-century. The positions contested were those of <a href="Mayor%20of%20Philadelphia">mayor</a> and <a href="District%20Attorney%20of%20Philadelphia">district attorney</a>, and all seventeen <a href="Philadelphia%20City%20Council">city council</a> seats. There was also a referendum on whether to consolidate the city and county governments. Citywide, the Democrats took majorities of over 100,000 votes, breaking a 67-year <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> hold on city government. <a href="Joseph%20S.%20Clark%20Jr.">Joseph S. Clark Jr.</a> and <a href="Richardson%20Dilworth">Richardson Dilworth</a>, two of the main movers for the charter reform, were elected mayor and district attorney, respectively. Led by local party chairman <a href="James%20A.%20Finnegan">James A. Finnegan</a>, the Democrats also took fourteen of seventeen city council seats, and all of the citywide offices on the ballot. A referendum on <a href="city-county%20consolidation">city-county consolidation</a> passed by a wide margin. The election marked the beginning of Democratic dominance of Philadelphia city politics, which continues today.

In the 1940s, <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> was the last major city in the United States to have nearly all of its political offices occupied by <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a>. Mayor <a href="Bernard%20Samuel">Bernard Samuel</a> and sheriff <a href="Austin%20Meehan">Austin Meehan</a> led the Republican organization and were supported by many of the city's business interests. In 1947, city voters had elected Republicans to the mayor's office and to every seat on the city council. Over the next few years, cracks in the Republican wall began to emerge as independent voters and reform-minded Republicans began to join with <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> in opposing what they saw as shortcomings of the Republican <a href="political%20machine">political machine</a>. Some in the Democratic coalition objected to making common cause with the reformers, but Democratic City Committee chairman <a href="James%20A.%20Finnegan">James A. Finnegan</a> saw it as a chance to revitalize his moribund party, saying "good government is good politics."

In 1949, that coalition scored a victory in the election for "row offices" (minor citywide offices including treasurer, coroner, and controller), and the reformers used their new platforms to expose corruption in city government. A bipartisan commission of reformers proposed a new city charter in 1950. The new scheme would shift power away from city council to a <a href="Strong-mayor">strong mayor</a>, something they believed would produce a system that would be more efficient and less susceptible to corruption. It also included provisions for civil service reform, requiring that city jobs be filled by <a href="Merit%20system">merit selection</a> rather than <a href="Spoils%20system">patronage</a>. The higher-ranking executive branch positions in city government would almost all be filled by the mayor directly without council approval, which was intended to encourage the appointment of independent experts instead of distributing jobs as reward for political service. Voters approved the charter overwhelmingly in an April 1951 referendum, setting up a showdown in November for election to the revised city government.

Samuel did not run for re-election as mayor, leaving an open seat to be contested by the Republican nominee, <a href="Daniel%20A.%20Poling">Daniel A. Poling</a>, and the Democrat, <a href="Joseph%20S.%20Clark%20Jr.">Joseph S. Clark Jr.</a> Clark was a lawyer and United States Army officer who had served in World War II. Raised in an upper-class Republican family, he switched his party affiliation to the Democrats in 1928. After several unsuccessful attempts at public office in Philadelphia, he served as a Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania. Clark was known as a reformer, having been elected city controller two years earlier in 1949 on a platform of cleaning up corruption in the city. Despite being slandered as a communist for his membership in the <a href="Americans%20for%20Democratic%20Action">Americans for Democratic Action</a>, a left-wing group, Clark was victorious.

In those two years, Clark probed graft and theft in the Samuel administration and reported his findings to the voters. Many of those accused of crimes were convicted, and several committed suicide. Clark continued his push for reform by urging adoption of the new city charter. He campaigned for mayor with the promise of a "clean sweep of City Hall". He won the support of party Democrats in part by announcing his intention to run whether they backed him or not. In the July primary election, he triumphed easily over former City Solicitor Joseph Sharfsin by an eight-to-one margin.

The Republican nominee, Poling, was a <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> preacher with a national reputation for integrity who GOP leaders hoped would help deflect the corruption charges leveled against the machine. Poling had worked for various charitable organizations and managed the "<a href="Christian%20Herald">Christian Herald</a>". His son, Clark V. Poling, was one of the <a href="Four%20Chaplains">Four Chaplains</a> lost aboard the <a href="SS%20Dorchester">SS "Dorchester"</a> in World War II, and Poling served as pastor at the <a href="Four%20Chaplains%23Chapel%20of%20Four%20Chaplains">chapel erected in their memory</a>. Poling was challenged in the primary by Walter P. Miller, a businessman who had the backing of independent Republicans. The ward leaders swung their support to Poling, who won by a six-to-one margin.

As in 1947 and 1949, Clark focused his campaign on the corruption of the Republican organization, calling it "the most corrupt political machine in the United States". Poling admitted that corruption existed, but pledged to root it out himself if elected. Philadelphia's two newspapers, the "<a href="The%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer">Inquirer</a>" and the "<a href="Philadelphia%20Bulletin">Bulletin</a>", had traditionally endorsed Republicans, but in 1951 favored the Democrats. Poling's association with the Republican party bosses clinched the "Inquirer"s endorsement for Clark; in an editorial, the editors said "the only way Philadelphia can get a change at City Hall is by throwing out the Republican ward-boss clique". Clark and his running mate, district attorney candidate <a href="Richardson%20Dilworth">Richardson Dilworth</a>, bought radio time and made street-corner speeches. In one speech, Dilworth called the Republican leadership "political hogs and extremely avaricious gentlemen". In a broadcast, Clark called his non-politician opponent the ignorant tool of corrupt interests, saying "he can know nothing about the subject personally for he has not been in politics in Philadelphia long enough to find out." Poling campaigned vigorously with the full support of his party organization, but the effort fell short.

The general election was a landslide for Clark, who won by more than 120,000 votes. With 58% of the vote, the Democrats had gained nearly 215,000 votes over the last election, in which they had been defeated. The Democrats' greatest gains were in the so-called "independent wards", where middle-class voters were more likely to split their tickets in pursuit of good government, and in the majority-black wards in <a href="North%20Philadelphia">North</a> and <a href="West%20Philadelphia">West Philadelphia</a>, where Clark's promise of civil service reform gained the confidence of black voters, who had traditionally been left out of the patronage system. As the result became apparent, he told reporters that it was a "great victory for the thinking people of Philadelphia and it ends a long hard fight."

Philadelphia elects a <a href="District%20Attorney%20of%20Philadelphia">district attorney</a> independently of the mayor, in a system that predates the charter change. Since 1957, district attorney elections have followed mayoral and city council elections by two years, but in 1951 both offices were up for election in the same year.

As in the mayor's race, the contest for district attorney pitted a Democratic reformer, <a href="Richardson%20Dilworth">Richardson Dilworth</a>, against a representative of the Republican machine, Michael A. Foley. Dilworth, like Clark, was a former Republican who had been advocating reform for several years. He had run for mayor unsuccessfully <a href="Philadelphia%20municipal%20election%2C%201947">in 1947</a>, with Clark as his campaign manager. In 1949, he was elected City Treasurer. Democratic Party leaders had intended Dilworth to be their candidate for mayor again in 1951, but when Clark announced his candidacy, Dilworth agreed to run for district attorney instead. Foley, an attorney for the <a href="Insurance%20Company%20of%20North%20America">Insurance Company of North America</a>, had organization backing in the primary but had no success against the Democratic wave in the general election. Dilworth was unopposed in the primary. In November, Dilworth won by almost as large a margin as Clark, taking just shy of 58% of the vote. He told reporters that the victory had a "sobering effect", adding: "the bigger the victory, the bigger the responsibility".

Under the new charter, Philadelphians elected a seventeen-member <a href="Philadelphia%20City%20Council">city council</a> in 1951, with ten members representing districts of the city, and the remaining seven being elected <a href="at-large">at-large</a>. By the rules of the <a href="limited%20voting">limited voting</a> system for the at-large seats, each political party could nominate five candidates and voters could only vote for five, with the result that the majority party could only take five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party. The Democrats' citywide triumph continued into the city council races, as they took nine of ten districts and five of seven at-large seats.

<a href="Constance%20Dallas">Constance Dallas</a>, the first woman to win election to City Council, was elected in a close vote in the 8th district (covering <a href="Chestnut%20Hill%2C%20Philadelphia">Chestnut Hill</a>, <a href="Germantown%2C%20Philadelphia">Germantown</a>, and <a href="Roxborough%2C%20Philadelphia">Roxborough</a>) over incumbent councilman Robert S. Hamilton. In the 1st district, which took in <a href="South%20Philadelphia">South Philadelphia</a>, attorney <a href="Thomas%20I.%20Guerin">Thomas I. Guerin</a> defeated Dominic J. Colubiale. In the 2nd, the Republicans' lone district-level victory came as electrical equipment salesman <a href="William%20M.%20Phillips">William M. Phillips</a> bested Louis Vignola, a <a href="labor%20union">labor union</a> official. In the 3rd district, made up of the southern half of West Philadelphia, incumbent <a href="Harry%20Norwitch">Harry Norwitch</a> defeated another incumbent from the old city council, George Maxman, who had held office since 1936. In the 4th, which covered the northern half of West Philadelphia, state representative <a href="Samuel%20Rose%20%28Philadelphia%29">Samuel Rose</a> defeated incumbent James G. Clark.

In the city's 5th district in North Philadelphia, another incumbent, Eugene J. Sullivan, was defeated by <a href="Raymond%20Pace%20Alexander">Raymond Pace Alexander</a>, a local attorney and <a href="African%20American">African American</a> civil rights leader. In the 6th district, covering <a href="Kensington%2C%20Philadelphia">Kensington</a> and <a href="Frankford%2C%20Philadelphia">Frankford</a>, plumbers' union official <a href="Michael%20J.%20Towey">Michael J. Towey</a> won over William J. Glowacz. In the 7th, <a href="James%20Hugh%20Joseph%20Tate">James Hugh Joseph Tate</a> defeated Joseph A. Ferko, a local <a href="Mummers%20Parade">Mummers string band</a> leader. Insurance broker <a href="Charles%20M.%20Finley">Charles M. Finley</a> defeated incumbent councilman William A. Kelley in the 9th district, which covered <a href="West%20Oak%20Lane%2C%20Philadelphia">Oak Lane</a>, <a href="Olney%2C%20Philadelphia">Olney</a>, and <a href="Logan%2C%20Philadelphia">Logan</a>. In <a href="Northeast%20Philadelphia">Northeast Philadelphia</a>'s 10th district, incumbent <a href="Clarence%20K.%20Crossan">Clarence K. Crossan</a>, who had held office since 1925, went down to defeat against real estate broker <a href="John%20F.%20Byrne%20Sr.">John F. Byrne Sr.</a>

In the at-large races, all five Democrats were elected, including city party chairman <a href="James%20A.%20Finnegan">James A. Finnegan</a>, former registration commissioner <a href="Victor%20E.%20Moore">Victor E. Moore</a>, Charter Commission secretary <a href="Lewis%20M.%20Stevens">Lewis M. Stevens</a>, attorney (and future district attorney of Philadelphia) <a href="Victor%20H.%20Blanc">Victor H. Blanc</a>, and magistrate <a href="Paul%20D%27Ortona">Paul D'Ortona</a>. The Republican slate ran more than 100,000 votes behind the Democrats, with incumbent councilman <a href="Louis%20Schwartz">Louis Schwartz</a> and state senator <a href="John%20W.%20Lord%20Jr.">John W. Lord Jr.</a> narrowly edging out labor leader John B. Backhus, assistant district attorney Colbert C. McClain, and clergyman Irwin W. Underhill for the two minority party slots on the council. The <a href="Progressive%20Party%20%28United%20States%2C%201948%29">Progressive Party</a>, a left-wing party founded in 1948 around <a href="Henry%20A.%20Wallace">Henry A. Wallace</a>'s presidential bid, ran two candidates who took less than one percent of the vote.

In the race for <a href="Philadelphia%20City%20Commissioners">city commissioners</a>, each party nominates two candidates and the top three are elected. The office was a county office, a holdover from the time before consolidation of the townships in Philadelphia County into one city. The most important of the remaining duties of the commissioners in Philadelphia was the conduct of the city's elections; they also had responsibility for regulating weights and measures. As in the other races, the Democrats triumphed, electing both <a href="Maurice%20S.%20Osser">Maurice S. Osser</a> and <a href="Thomas%20P.%20McHenry">Thomas P. McHenry</a>. McHenry was an incumbent who had served as commissioner since 1945, while Osser was new to the office, having previously worked as a lawyer and as the leader of the 16th ward. The Republican spot on the county commission went to <a href="Walter%20I.%20Davidson">Walter I. Davidson</a>, a sales executive.

The Democrats' success continued down the ballot. The incumbent sheriff, <a href="Austin%20Meehan">Austin Meehan</a>, did not run for re-election, and the race for county <a href="Sheriffs%20in%20the%20United%20States">sheriff</a> pitted two incumbent city councilmen against each other for the job: Democrat <a href="William%20M.%20Lennox">William M. Lennox</a> and Republican <a href="Cornelius%20S.%20Deegan%20Jr.">Cornelius S. Deegan Jr.</a> The office of sheriff was another holdover county office. The sheriff, whose job differed from that of the chief of police, was the chief law enforcement officer of the court. Lennox came out ahead, and would hold the job for the next twenty years.

Democrat <a href="Joseph%20A.%20Scanlon">Joseph A. Scanlon</a> was elected over Republican Edward W. Furia for <a href="Court%20clerk">clerk of courts</a>, an officer charged with the collection and disbursement of payments ordered by the courts. Scanlon, a former state legislator, served as clerk until 1957, when he died in office. For <a href="recorder%20of%20deeds">recorder of deeds</a>, another county administrative office, Democrat <a href="Marshall%20L.%20Shepard">Marshall L. Shepard</a> was elected. Shepard was a Baptist minister who had also served as recorder of deeds in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> Two years later, the office was folded into the city government and converted to a civil service position.

Most of the <a href="Pennsylvania%20courts%20of%20common%20pleas">common pleas court</a> judges up for re-election were endorsed by both parties, but in the one contested race, Democrat John Morgan Davis defeated incumbent Republican Thomas Bluett. The Democrats also took eight of the fourteen magisterial district judge positions (a local court, the duties of which are now performed by the <a href="Philadelphia%20Municipal%20Court">Philadelphia Municipal Court</a>).

A statewide referendum on the ballot that day continued the work begun by the new city charter in asking voters to consolidate the city and county governments in Philadelphia. In 1854, all of the municipalities in Philadelphia County had been <a href="Act%20of%20Consolidation%2C%201854">consolidated</a> into one city, but many county offices still existed, duplicating the efforts of city officials. The merger would also bring county offices under the civil service protections of the new city charter. Merging the city and county governments had been defeated in a 1937 referendum, but in 1951 the question was overwhelmingly approved. Two other ballot proposals authorized the city to borrow $17 million for municipal improvements and $14 million for the <a href="Philadelphia%20Gas%20Works">gas works</a>; both passed by a five-to-one margin.

The 1951 election was the final blow to Philadelphia's once-dominant Republican machine. After winning some minor offices in 1953, the Republican organization quickly declined again. Since that time, the Democratic Party has dominated the city's politics, with no other party electing a mayor or a majority of the city council. With Republicans no longer playing a significant role in Philadelphia's government, the main battle in city politics came to be between the Democratic Party's reformers and its organization stalwarts. By 1965, with most reformers out of government, the ascendant political culture in the city returned to what the "<a href="Philadelphia%20Bulletin">Philadelphia Bulletin</a>" called "the old, narrow partisan view, the aroma of inside deals, back-scratching, and City Hall favoritism ... crass political bidding for favor at taxpayers' expense."
