Sexuality after spinal cord injury

Although <a href="spinal%20cord%20injury">spinal cord injury</a> (SCI) often causes <a href="sexual%20dysfunction">sexual dysfunction</a>, many people with SCI are able to have satisfying sex lives. Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect <a href="sexual%20function">sexual function</a> and sexuality in broader areas, which in turn has important effects on quality of life. Damage to the <a href="spinal%20cord">spinal cord</a> impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the <a href="lesion">lesion</a>. This results in lost or reduced <a href="sensory%20system">sensation</a> and <a href="flaccid%20paralysis">muscle motion</a>, and affects <a href="orgasm">orgasm</a>, <a href="erection">erection</a>, <a href="ejaculation">ejaculation</a>, and <a href="vaginal%20lubrication">vaginal lubrication</a>. More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications. Psycho-social causes include <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a> and altered <a href="self-image">self-image</a>. Many people with SCI have satisfying <a href="sex%20life">sex lives</a>, and many experience <a href="sexual%20arousal">sexual arousal</a> and orgasm. People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts. <a href="Neuroplasticity">Neural plasticity</a> may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive <a href="eroticism">erotic</a> areas of the skin in <a href="erogenous%20zone">erogenous zone</a>s or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation.

Drugs, devices, surgery, and other interventions exist to help men achieve erection and ejaculation. Although <a href="Fertility%23Male%20fertility">male fertility</a> is reduced, many men with SCI can still father children, particularly with medical interventions. <a href="Fertility%23Female%20fertility">Women's fertility</a> is not usually affected, although precautions must be taken for <a href="prenatal%20care">safe pregnancy</a> and delivery. People with SCI need to take measures during sexual activity to deal with SCI effects such as weakness and movement limitations, and to avoid injuries such as skin damage in areas of reduced sensation. Education and counseling about sexuality is an important part of <a href="Rehabilitation%20in%20spinal%20cord%20injury">SCI rehabilitation</a> but is often missing or insufficient. Rehabilitation for children and adolescents aims to promote healthy development of sexuality and includes education for them and their families. Culturally inherited biases and stereotypes negatively affect people with SCI, particularly when held by professional caregivers. <a href="Body%20image">Body image</a> and other insecurities affect sexual function, and have profound repercussions on <a href="self-esteem">self-esteem</a> and self-concept. SCI causes difficulties in romantic partnerships, due to problems with sexual function and to other stresses introduced by the injury and disability, but many of those with SCI have fulfilling relationships and marriages. Relationships, self-esteem, and reproductive ability are all aspects of <a href="Human%20sexuality">sexuality</a>, which encompasses not just <a href="Human%20sexual%20activity">sexual practices</a> but a complex array of factors: cultural, social, psychological, and emotional influences.

<a href="Human%20sexuality">Sexuality</a> is an important part of each person's identity, although some people might have no interest in sex. Sexuality has biological, psychological, emotional, spiritual, social, and cultural aspects. It involves not only sexual behaviors but relationships, self-image, <a href="Libido">sex drive</a>, reproduction, <a href="sexual%20orientation">sexual orientation</a>, and <a href="Gender">gender expression</a>. Each person's sexuality is influenced by lifelong <a href="socialization">socialization</a>, in which factors such as <a href="Religion%20and%20sexuality">religious</a> and cultural background play a part, and is expressed in self-esteem and the beliefs one holds about oneself (identifying as a woman, or as an attractive person).

SCI is extremely disruptive to sexuality, and it most frequently happens to young people, who are at a peak in their sexual and reproductive lives. Yet the importance of sexuality as a part of life is not diminished by a disabling injury. Although for years people with SCI were believed to be <a href="asexuality">asexual</a>, research has shown sexuality to be a high priority for people with SCI and an important aspect of <a href="quality%20of%20life">quality of life</a>. In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most <a href="paraplegia">paraplegics</a> rated sexual function as their top priority, and most <a href="tetraplegia">tetraplegics</a> rated it second, after hand and arm function. Sexual function has a profound impact on self-esteem and adjustment to life post-injury. People who are able to adapt to their changed bodies and to have satisfying sex lives have better overall quality of life.

SCI usually causes sexual dysfunction, due to problems with sensation and the body's arousal responses. The ability to experience sexual pleasure and orgasm are among the top priorities for sexual rehabilitation among injured people.

Much research has been done into <a href="erection">erection</a>. By two years post-injury, 80% of men recover at least partial erectile function, though many experience <a href="erectile%20dysfunction">problems</a> with the reliability and duration of their erections if they do not use interventions to enhance them. Studies have found that half or up to 65% of men with SCI have orgasms, although the experience may feel different than it did before the injury. Most men say it feels weaker, and takes longer and more stimulation to achieve.

Common problems women experience post-SCI are <a href="Dyspareunia">pain with intercourse</a> and difficulty achieving orgasm. Around half of women with SCI are able to reach orgasm, usually when their <a href="sex%20organ">genitals</a> are stimulated. Some women report the sensation of orgasm to be the same as before the injury, and others say the sensation is reduced.

The severity of the injury is an important aspect in determining how much sexual function returns as a person recovers. According to the <a href="American%20Spinal%20Injury%20Association">American Spinal Injury Association</a> grading scale, an <a href="spinal%20cord%20injury%23Complete%20and%20incomplete%20injuries">incomplete SCI</a> is one in which some amount of sensation or motor function is preserved in the <a href="rectum">rectum</a>. This indicates that the brain can still send and receive some messages to the lowest parts of the spinal cord, beyond the damaged area. In people with incomplete injury, some or all of the <a href="spinal%20tracts">spinal tracts</a> involved in sexual responses remain intact, allowing, for example, orgasms like those of uninjured people. In men, having an incomplete injury improves chances of being able to achieve erections and orgasms over those with complete injuries.
Even people with complete SCI, in whom the spinal cord cannot transmit any messages past the level of the lesion, can achieve orgasm. In 1960, in one of the earliest studies to look at orgasm and SCI, the term "phantom orgasm" was coined to describe women's perception of orgasmic sensations despite SCI—but subsequent studies have suggested the experience is not merely psychological. Men with complete SCI report sexual sensations at the time of ejaculation, accompanied by physical signs normally found at orgasm, such as increased blood pressure. Women can experience orgasm with vibration to the <a href="cervix">cervix</a> regardless of level or completeness of injury; the sensation is the same as uninjured women experience.

The <a href="Peripheral%20nervous%20system">peripheral</a> nerves of the <a href="parasympathetic%20nervous%20system">parasympathetic nervous system</a> that carry messages to the brain (<a href="afferent%20nerve%20fiber">afferent nerve fiber</a>s) may explain why people with complete SCI feel sexual and climactic sensations. One proposed explanation for orgasm in women despite complete SCI is that the <a href="vagus%20nerve">vagus nerve</a> bypasses the spinal cord and carries sensory information from the genitals directly to the brain. Women with complete injuries can achieve sexual arousal and orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris, cervix, or vagina, which are each innervated by different nerve pathways, which suggests that even if SCI interferes with one area, function might be preserved in others. In both injured and uninjured people, the brain is responsible for the way sensations of climax are perceived: the qualitative experiences associated with climax are modulated by the brain, rather than a specific area of the body.

In addition to completeness of injury, the location of damage on the spinal cord influences how much sexual function is retained or regained after injury. Injuries can occur in the <a href="Cervical%20vertebrae">cervical</a> (neck), <a href="Thoracic%20vertebrae">thoracic</a> (back), <a href="lumbar%20vertebrae">lumbar</a> (lower back), or <a href="sacrum">sacral</a> (pelvic) levels. Between each pair of vertebrae, <a href="spinal%20nerve">spinal nerve</a>s branch off of the spinal cord and carry information to and from specific parts of the body. The location of injury to the spinal cord maps to the body, and the area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve, is called a <a href="dermatome%20%28anatomy%29">dermatome</a>. All dermatomes below the level of injury to the spinal cord may lose sensation.

An injury at a lower point on the spine does not necessarily mean better sexual function; for example, people with injuries in the sacral region are less likely to be able to orgasm than those with injuries higher on the spine. Women with injuries above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral injuries (59% vs 17%). In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to reflexes that do not require input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.

The body's physical arousal response (vaginal lubrication and engorgement of the <a href="clitoris">clitoris</a> in women and erection in men) occurs due to two separate pathways which normally work together: <a href="wikt%3Apsychogenic">psychogenic</a> and reflex. Arousal due to fantasies, visual input, or other mental stimulation is a psychogenic sexual experience, and arousal resulting from physical contact to the genital area is reflexogenic. In psychogenic arousal, messages travel from the brain via the spinal cord to the nerves in the genital area. The psychogenic pathway is served by the spinal cord at levels <a href="thoracic%20spinal%20nerve%2011">T11</a>–<a href="Lumbar%20spinal%20nerve%202">L2</a>. Thus people injured above the level of the T11 vertebra do not usually experience psychogenic erection or vaginal lubrication, but those with an injury below <a href="thoracic%20spinal%20nerve%2012">T12</a> can. Even without these physical responses, people with SCI often feel aroused, just as uninjured people do. The ability to feel the sensation of a pinprick and light touch in the dermatomes for T11–L2 predicts how well the ability to have psychogenic arousal is preserved in both sexes. Input from the psychogenic pathway is <a href="sympathetic%20nervous%20system">sympathetic</a>, and most of the time it sends inhibitory signals that prevent the physical arousal response; in response to sexual stimulation, excitatory signals are increased and inhibition is reduced. Removing the inhibition that is normally present allows the spinal reflexes that trigger the arousal response to take effect.

The reflexogenic pathway activates the parasympathetic nervous system in response to the sensation of touch. It is mediated by a reflex arc that goes to the spinal cord (not to the brain) and is served by the sacral segments of the spinal cord at <a href="sacral%20spinal%20nerve%202">S2</a>–<a href="sacral%20spinal%20nerve%204">S4</a>. A woman with a spinal cord lesion above T11 may not be able to experience psychogenic vaginal lubrication, but may still have reflex lubrication if her sacral segments are uninjured. Likewise, although a man's ability to get a psychogenic erection when mentally aroused may be impaired after a higher-level SCI, he may still be able to get a reflex or "spontaneous" erection. These erections may result in the absence of psychological arousal when the penis is touched or brushed, e.g. by clothing, but they do not last long and are generally lost when the stimulus is removed. Reflex erections may increase in frequency after SCI, due to the loss of inhibitory input from the brain that would suppress the response in an uninjured man. Conversely, an injury below the S1 level impairs reflex erections but not psychogenic erections. People who have some preservation of sensation in the dermatomes at the S4 and S5 levels and display a <a href="bulbocavernosus%20reflex">bulbocavernosus reflex</a> (contraction of the pelvic floor in response to pressure on the clitoris or <a href="glans%20penis">glans penis</a>) are usually able to experience reflex erections or lubrication. Like other reflexes, reflexive sexual responses may be lost immediately after injury but return over time as the individual recovers from <a href="spinal%20shock">spinal shock</a>.

Most people with SCI have problems with the body's physical sexual arousal response. Problems that result directly from impaired neural transmission are called "primary sexual dysfunction". The function of the genitals is almost always affected by SCI, by alteration, reduction, or complete loss of sensation. <a href="Neuropathic%20pain">Neuropathic pain</a>, in which damaged nerve pathways signal pain in the absence of any noxious stimulus, is common after SCI and interferes with sex.

Secondary dysfunction results from factors that follow from the injury, such as loss of <a href="urinary%20incontinence">bladder</a> and <a href="fecal%20incontinence">bowel control</a> or impaired movement. The main barrier to sexual activity that people with SCI cite is physical limitation; e.g. balance problems and muscle weakness cause difficulty with positioning. <a href="Spasticity">Spasticity</a>, tightening of muscles due to increased <a href="muscle%20tone">muscle tone</a>, is another complication that interferes with sex. Some medications have side effects that impede sexual pleasure or interfere with sexual function: <a href="antidepressant">antidepressant</a>s, <a href="muscle%20relaxant">muscle relaxant</a>s, <a href="Hypnotic">sleeping pills</a> and drugs that treat spasticity. Hormonal changes that alter sexual function may take place after SCI; levels of <a href="prolactin">prolactin</a> heighten, women temporarily stop menstruating (<a href="Amenorrhoea">amenorrhea</a>), and men experience reduced levels of <a href="testosterone">testosterone</a>. Testosterone deficiency causes reduced <a href="libido">libido</a>, increased weakness, fatigue, and failure to respond to erection-enhancing drugs.

Tertiary sexual dysfunction results from psychological and social factors. Reduced libido, desire, or experience of arousal could be due to psychological or situational factors such as depression, anxiety, and changes in relationships. Both sexes experience reduced sexual desire after SCI, and almost half of men and almost three quarters of women have trouble becoming psychologically aroused. <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">Depression</a> is the most common cause of problems with arousal in people with SCI. People frequently experience <a href="grief">grief</a> and despair initially after the injury. <a href="Anxiety">Anxiety</a> and <a href="Substance%20abuse">drug</a> and <a href="alcohol%20abuse">alcohol abuse</a> may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can exacerbate sexual difficulties. Drug and alcohol abuse increase unhealthy behaviors, straining relationships and social functioning.

SCI can lead to significant insecurities, which have repercussions for sexuality and self-image. SCI often affects body image, either due to the host of changes in the body that affect appearance (e.g. unused muscles in the legs become atrophied), or due to changes in self-perception not directly from physical changes. People frequently find themselves less attractive and expect others not to be attracted to them after SCI. These insecurities cause fear of rejection and deter people from initiating contact or sexual activity or engaging in sex. Feelings of undesirability or worthlessness even lead some to suggest to their partners that they find someone able bodied.

Men with SCI rank the ability to father children among their highest concerns relating to sexuality. <a href="Fertility%23Male%20fertility">Male fertility</a> is reduced after SCI, due to a combination of problems with erections, ejaculation, and quality of the <a href="semen">semen</a>. As with other types of sexual response, ejaculation can be psychogenic or reflexogenic, and the level of injury affects a man's ability to experience each type. As many as 95% of men with SCI have problems with ejaculation (<a href="anejaculation">anejaculation</a>), possibly due to impaired coordination of input from different parts of the nervous system. Erection, orgasm, and ejaculation can each occur independently, although the ability to ejaculate seems linked to the quality of the erection, and the ability to orgasm is linked to the ejaculation facility. Even men with complete injuries may be able to ejaculate, because other nerves involved in ejaculation can effect the response without input from the spinal cord. In general, the higher the level of injury, the more physical stimulation the man needs to ejaculate. Conversely, <a href="Premature%20ejaculation">premature</a> or spontaneous ejaculation can be a problem for men with injuries at levels T12–L1. It can be severe enough that ejaculation is provoked by thinking a sexual thought, or for no reason at all, and is not accompanied by orgasm.
Most men have a normal <a href="semen%20analysis">sperm count</a>, but a high proportion of <a href="sperm">sperm</a> are abnormal; they are less <a href="sperm%20motility">motile</a> and do not survive as well. The reason for these abnormalities is not known, but research points to dysfunction of the <a href="seminal%20vesicle">seminal vesicle</a>s and <a href="prostate">prostate</a>, which concentrate substances that are toxic to sperm. <a href="Cytokine">Cytokine</a>s, <a href="immune%20system">immune</a> proteins which promote an <a href="inflammation">inflammatory</a> response, are present at higher concentrations in semen of men with SCI, as is <a href="PAF%20acetylhydrolase">platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase</a>; both are harmful to sperm. Another immune-related response to SCI is the presence of a higher number of <a href="white%20blood%20cell">white blood cell</a>s in the semen.

The numbers of women with SCI giving birth and having healthy babies are increasing. Around a half to two-thirds of women with SCI report they might want to have children, and 14–20% do get pregnant at least once. Although female fertility is not usually permanently reduced by SCI, there is a stress response that can happen immediately post-injury that alters levels of fertility-related hormones in the body. In about half of women, <a href="menstruation">menstruation</a> stops after the injury but then returns within an average of five months—it returns within a year for a large majority. After menstruation returns, women with SCI become pregnant at a rate close to that of the rest of the population.
Pregnancy is associated with greater-than-normal risks in women with SCI, among them increased risk of <a href="deep%20vein%20thrombosis">deep vein thrombosis</a>, <a href="Respiratory%20tract%20infection">respiratory infection</a>, and <a href="urinary%20tract%20infection">urinary tract infection</a>. Considerations exist such as maintaining proper positioning in a wheelchair, prevention of pressure sores, and increased difficulty moving due to weight gain and changes in center of balance. <a href="Assistive%20technology">Assistive devices</a> may need to be altered and medications changed.

For women with injuries above <a href="Sixth%20thoracic%20vertebra">T6</a>, a risk during labor and delivery that threatens both mother and fetus is <a href="autonomic%20dysreflexia">autonomic dysreflexia</a>, in which the blood pressure increases to dangerous levels high enough to cause potentially deadly <a href="stroke">stroke</a>. Drugs such as <a href="nifedipine">nifedipine</a> and <a href="captopril">captopril</a> can be used to manage an episode if it occurs, and <a href="Epidural%20administration">epidural</a> anesthesia helps although it is not very reliable in women with SCI. <a href="Anesthesia">Anesthesia</a> is used for labor and delivery even for women without sensation, who may only experience contractions as abdominal discomfort, increased spasticity, and episodes of autonomic dysreflexia. Reduced sensation in the pelvic area means women with SCI usually have less painful delivery; in fact, they may fail to realize when they go into labor. If there are deformities in the pelvis or spine <a href="caesarian%20section">caesarian section</a> may be necessary. Babies of women with SCI are more likely to be born <a href="Preterm%20birth">prematurely</a>, and, premature or not, they are more likely to be small for their gestational time.

Although erections are not necessary for satisfying sexual encounters, many men see them as important, and treating <a href="erectile%20dysfunction">erectile dysfunction</a> improves their relationships and quality of life. Whatever treatment is used, it works best in combination with talk-oriented therapy to help integrate it into the sex life.

Oral medications and mechanical devices are the first choice in treatment because they are less invasive, are often effective, and are well tolerated. Oral medications include <a href="sildenafil">sildenafil</a> (Viagra), <a href="tadalafil">tadalafil</a> (Cialis), and <a href="vardenafil">vardenafil</a> (Levitra).

<a href="Penis%20pump">Penis pump</a>s induce erections without the need for drugs or invasive treatments. To use a pump, the man inserts his penis into a cylinder, then pumps it to create a vacuum which draws blood into the penis, making it erect. He then slides a <a href="cock%20ring">ring</a> from the outside of the cylinder onto the base of the penis to hold the blood in and maintain the erection. A man who is able to get an erection but has trouble maintaining it for long enough can use a ring by itself. The ring cannot be left on for more than 30 minutes and cannot be used at the same time as <a href="anticoagulant">anticoagulant</a> medications.
If oral medications and mechanical treatments fail, the second choice is local injections: medications such as <a href="papaverine">papaverine</a> and <a href="prostaglandin">prostaglandin</a> that alter the blood flow and trigger erection are injected into the penis. This method is preferred for its effectiveness, but can cause pain and scarring.

Another option is to insert a small pellet of medication into the <a href="urethra">urethra</a>, but this requires higher doses than injections and may not be as effective. Topical medications to dilate the blood vessels have been used, but are not very effective or well tolerated. Electrical stimulation of <a href="Efferent%20nerve%20fiber">efferent nerves</a> at the S2 level can be used to trigger an erection that lasts as long as the stimulation does.

Surgical implants, either of flexible rods or inflatable tubes, are reserved for when other methods fail because of the potential for serious complications, which occur in as many as 10% of cases. They carry the risk of eroding penile tissue (breaking through the skin). Although satisfaction among men who use them is high, if they do need to be removed implants make other methods such as injections and vacuum devices unusable due to tissue damage.

It is also possible for erectile dysfunction to exist not as a direct result of SCI but due to factors such as major depression, <a href="Diabetes%20mellitus">diabetes</a>, or drugs such as those taken for spasticity. Finding and treating the root cause may alleviate the problem. For example, men who experience erectile problems as the result of a testosterone deficiency can receive <a href="androgen%20replacement%20therapy">androgen replacement therapy</a>.

Without medical intervention, the male fertility rate after SCI is 5–14%, but the rate increases with treatments. Even with all available medical interventions, fewer than half of men with SCI can father children. Assisted <a href="insemination">insemination</a> is usually required. As with erection, therapies used to treat infertility in uninjured men are used for those with SCI.

For anejaculation in SCI, the first-line method for <a href="Semen%20collection">sperm retrieval</a> is penile vibratory stimulation (PVS). A high-speed vibrator is applied to the glans penis to trigger a reflex that causes ejaculation, usually within a few minutes. Reports of efficacy with PVS range from 15–88%, possibly due to differences in vibrator settings and experience of clinicians, as well as level and completeness of injury. Complete lesions strictly above <a href="Onuf%27s%20nucleus">Onuf's nucleus</a> (S2–S4) are responsive to PVS in 98%, but complete lesions of the S2–S4 segments are not.

In case of failure with PVS, spermatozoa are sometimes collected by <a href="electroejaculation">electroejaculation</a>: an electrical probe is inserted into the rectum, where it triggers ejaculation. The success rate is 80–100%, but the technique requires anaesthesia and does not have the potential to be done at home that PVS has. Both PVS and electroejaculation carry a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, so drugs to prevent the condition can be given in advance and blood pressure is monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible. Massage of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles is another method to retrieve stored sperm. If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable sperm, sperm can be surgically removed by <a href="testicular%20sperm%20extraction">testicular sperm extraction</a> or <a href="percutaneous%20epididymal%20sperm%20aspiration">percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration</a>. These procedures yield sperm in 86–100% of cases, but nonsurgical treatments are preferred.

Premature or spontaneous ejaculation is treated with antidepressants including <a href="selective%20serotonin%20reuptake%20inhibitor">selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</a>s, which are known to delay ejaculation as a <a href="side%20effect">side effect</a>.

Compared with the options available for treating sexual dysfunction in men (for whom results are concretely observable), those available for women are limited. For example, <a href="PDE5%20inhibitor">PDE5 inhibitor</a>s, oral medications for treating erectile dysfunction in men, have been tested for their ability to increase sexual responses such as arousal and orgasm in women—but no controlled trials have been done in women with SCI, and trials in other women yielded only inconclusive results. In theory, women's sexual response could be improved using a vacuum device made to draw blood into the clitoris, but few studies on treatments for sexual function in women with SCI have been carried out. There is a particular paucity of information outside the area of reproduction.

Counseling about sex and sexuality by medical professionals, <a href="psychologist">psychologist</a>s, <a href="social%20work">social work</a>ers, and nurses is a part of most <a href="Rehabilitation%20in%20spinal%20cord%20injury">SCI rehabilitation</a> programs. Education is part of the follow-up treatment for people with SCI, as are <a href="psychotherapy">psychotherapy</a>, peer <a href="mentorship">mentorship</a>, and social activities; these are helpful for improving skills needed for socializing and relationships. Rather than addressing sexual dysfunction strictly as a physical problem, appropriate sexual rehabilitation care takes into account the individual as a whole, for example addressing issues with relationships and self-esteem. Sexual counseling includes teaching techniques to manage depression and stress, and to increase attention to preserved sensations during sexual activity. Education includes information about birth control or assistive devices such as those for positioning in sex, or advice and ideas for addressing problems such as incontinence and autonomic dysreflexia.
Many SCI patients have received misinformation about the effects of their injury on their sexual function and benefit from education about it. Although sexual education shortly after injury is known to be helpful and desired, it is frequently missing in rehabilitation settings; a common complaint from those who go through rehabilitation programs is that they offer insufficient information about sexuality. Longer-term education and counseling on sex after discharge from a hospital setting are especially important, yet sexuality is one of the most often neglected areas in long-term SCI rehabilitation, particularly for women. Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped to handle it. Clinicians must be circumspect in bringing up sexual matters since people may be uncomfortable with or unready for the subject. Many patients wait for providers to broach the topic even if they do want the information.
A person's experience in managing sexuality after the injury relies not only on physical factors like severity and level of the injury, but on aspects of life circumstances and personality such as sexual experience and attitudes about sex. As well as evaluating physical concerns, clinicians must take into account factors that affect each patient's situation: gender, age, cultural, and social factors. Aspects of patients' cultural and religious backgrounds, even if unnoticed before the injury caused sexual dysfunction, affect care and treatments—particularly when cultural attitudes and assumptions of patients and care providers conflict. Health professionals must be sensitive to issues of <a href="sexual%20orientation">sexual orientation</a> and <a href="gender%20identity">gender identity</a>, showing respect and acceptance while communicating, listening, and emotionally supporting. Providers who treat SCI have been found to assume their patients are <a href="heterosexuality">heterosexual</a> or to exclude <a href="LGBTQ">LGBTQ</a> patients from their awareness, potentially resulting in substandard care. Academic research on sexuality and disability under-represents LGBTQ perspectives as well.
As well as the patient, the partner of an injured person frequently needs support and counseling. It can help with adjustment to a new relationship dynamic and self-image (such as being placed in the role of caretaker) or with stresses that arise in the sexual relationship. Frequently, partners of injured people must contend with feelings like guilt, anger, anxiety, and exhaustion while dealing with the added financial burden of lost wages and medical expenses. Counseling aims to strengthen the relationship by improving communication and trust.

Not only does SCI present children and adolescents with many of the same difficulties adults face, it affects the development of their sexuality. Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults, very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people. Injured children and adolescents need ongoing, age-appropriate <a href="sex%20education">sex education</a> that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to sexuality and sexual function. Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.

Once patients reach their teens, they need more specific information about pregnancy, birth control, self-esteem, and dating. Teenagers with lost or reduced genital sensation benefit from education about alternative ways to experience pleasure and satisfaction from sexual acts. The teen years are often particularly difficult for those with SCI, in terms of body image and relationships. Given the importance they place on sexuality and privacy, adolescents may experience humiliation when parents or caregivers bathe them or take care of bowel and bladder needs. They can benefit from sexuality counseling, support groups, and mentoring by adults with SCI who can share experiences and lead discussions with peers. With the right care and education from family and professionals, injured children and adolescents can develop into sexually healthy adults.

People make a variety of sexual adaptations to help adjust to SCI. They often change their sexual practices, moving away from genital stimulation and intercourse and toward greater emphasis on touching above the level of injury and other aspects of intimacy such as kissing and caressing. It is necessary to discover new sexual positions if ones used previously have become too difficult. Other factors that enhance sexual pleasure are positive memories, <a href="sexual%20fantasy">fantasies</a>, relaxation, meditation, breathing techniques, and most importantly, trust with a partner. People with SCI can make use of visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile stimuli. It is possible to train oneself to be more mindful of the cerebral aspects of sex and of feeling in areas of the body that have sensation; this increases chances of orgasm. The importance of desire and comfort is the reasoning behind the quip "the most important sexual organ is the brain."

Adjusting to post-injury changes in the body's sensation is difficult enough to cause some to give up on the idea of satisfying sex at first. But changes in sensitivity above and at the level of injury occur over time; people may find <a href="erogenous%20zone">erogenous zone</a>s like the nipples or ears have become more sensitive, enough to be sexually satisfying. They may discover new erogenous zones that were not erotic before the injury; care providers can help direct this discovery. These erogenous areas can even lead to orgasm when stimulated. Such changes may result from "remapping" of sensory areas in the brain due to <a href="neuroplasticity">neuroplasticity</a>, particularly when sensation in the genitals is completely lost.

Commonly there is an area on the body between the areas where sensation is lost and those where is preserved called a "transition zone" that has increased sensitivity and is often sexually pleasurable when stimulated. Also known as a "border zone", this area may feel the way the penis or clitoris did before injury, and can even give orgasmic sensation. Due to such changes in sensation, people are encouraged to explore their bodies to discover what areas are pleasurable. <a href="Masturbation">Masturbation</a> is a useful way to learn about the body's new responses.
Tests exist to measure how much sensation a person has retained in the genitals after an injury, which are used to tailor treatment or rehabilitation. Sensory testing helps people learn to recognize the sensations associated with arousal and orgasm. Injured people who are able to achieve orgasms from stimulation to the genitals may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity. <a href="Sex%20toy">Sex toy</a>s such as <a href="vibrator%20%28sex%20toy%29">vibrators</a> are available, e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced sensitivity, and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities. For example, a hand strap can be added to a vibrator or <a href="dildo">dildo</a> to assist someone with poor hand function.

SCI presents extra needs to consider for sexual activity; for example muscle weakness and movement limitations restrict options for positioning. Pillows or devices such as wedges can be placed to help achieve and maintain a desired position for people affected by weakness or movement limitations. Assistive devices exist to aid in motion, such as sliding chairs to provide pelvic thrust. Spasticity and pain also create barriers to sexual activity; these changes may require couples to use new positions, such as seated in a wheelchair. A warm bath can be taken prior to sex, and massage and stretching can be incorporated into foreplay to ease spasticity.
Another consideration is loss of sensation, which puts people at risk for wounds such as <a href="Pressure%20ulcer">pressure sores</a> and injuries that could become worse before being noticed. Friction from sexual activity may damage the skin, so it is necessary after sex to inspect areas that could have been hurt, particularly the buttocks and genital area. People who already have pressure sores must take care not to make the wounds worse. Irritation to the genitals increases risk for vaginal infections, which get worse if they go unnoticed. Women who do not get sufficient vaginal lubrication on their own can use a commercially available <a href="personal%20lubricant">personal lubricant</a> to decrease friction.
Another risk is autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency involving dangerously high blood pressure. People at risk for AD can take medications to help prevent it before sex, but if it does occur they must stop and seek treatment. Mild signs of AD such as slightly high blood pressure frequently do accompany sexual arousal and are not cause for alarm. In fact, some interpret the symptoms of AD that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing, or even climactic.
A concern for sexual activity that is not dangerous but that can be upsetting for both partners is bladder or bowel leakage due to <a href="urinary%20incontinence">urinary</a> or <a href="fecal%20incontinence">fecal incontinence</a>. Couples can prepare for sex by draining the bladder using <a href="Intermittent%20catheterisation">intermittent catheterization</a> or placing towels down in advance. People with indwelling <a href="urinary%20catheterization">urinary catheters</a> must take special care with them, removing them or taping them out of the way.
<a href="Birth%20control">Birth control</a> is another consideration: women with SCI are usually not prescribed <a href="Oral%20contraceptive%20pill">oral contraceptives</a> since the hormones in them increase the risk of blood clots, for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk. <a href="Intrauterine%20device">Intrauterine device</a>s could have dangerous complications that could go undetected if sensation is reduced. <a href="Diaphragm%20%28birth%20control%29">Diaphragms</a> that require something to be inserted into the vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function. An option of choice for women is for partners to use <a href="condom">condom</a>s.

In the first months after an injury, people commonly prioritize other aspects of rehabilitation over sexual matters, but in the long term, adjustment to life with SCI necessitates addressing sexuality.

Although physical, psychological and emotional factors militate to reduce the frequency of sex after injury, it increases after time. As years go by, the odds that a person will become involved in a sexual relationship increase. Difficulties adjusting to a changed appearance and physical limitations contribute to reduced frequency of sexual acts, and improved body image is associated with an increase. Like frequency, sexual desire and sexual satisfaction often decrease after SCI. The reduction in women's sexual desire and frequency may be in part because they believe they can no longer enjoy sex, or because their independence or social opportunities are reduced. As time goes by people usually adjust sexually, adapting to their changed bodies. Some 80% of women return to being sexually active,

and the numbers who report being sexually satisfied range from 40–88%. Although women's satisfaction is usually lower than before the injury, it improves as time passes. Women report higher rates of sexual satisfaction than men post-SCI for as many as 10–45 years. More than a quarter of men have substantial problems with adjustment to their post-injury sexual functioning. Sexual satisfaction depends on a host of factors, some more important than the physical function of the genitals: intimacy, quality of relationships, satisfaction of partners, willingness to be sexually experimental, and good communication. Genital function is not as important to men's sexual satisfaction as are their partners' satisfaction and intimacy in their relationships. For women, quality of relationships, closeness with partners, sexual desire, and positive body image, as well as the physical function of the genitals, contribute sexual satisfaction. For both sexes, long-term relationships are associated with higher sexual satisfaction.

A <a href="catastrophic%20injury">catastrophic injury</a> such as SCI puts strain on marriages and other romantic relationships, which in turn has important implications for quality of life. Partners of injured people often feel out of control, overwhelmed, angry, and guilty while having added work related to the injury, less help with responsibilities like parenting, and loss of wages. Relationship stress and excessive dependence in relationships increases risk of depression for the person with SCI; supportive relationships are protective.

Relationships change as partners take on new roles, such as that of caregiver, which may conflict with the role of partner and require substantial sacrifice of time and self-care. These changes in responsibilities may mean a reverse in societally determined <a href="gender%20role">gender role</a>s within relationships; inability to fulfil these roles affects sexuality in general.

Sexual dysfunction is a stressor in relationships. People are often as concerned about failing to keep a partner satisfied as they are about meeting their own sexual needs. In fact, two of the top reasons people with SCI cite for wanting to have sex are for intimacy and to keep a partner. The frequency of sex correlates with the desire of the uninjured partner.

Although problems with sexual function that result from SCI play a part in some divorces, they are not as important as emotional maturity in determining the success of a marriage. People with SCI get divorced more often than the rest of the population, and marriages that took place before the injury fail more often than those that took place after (33% vs. 21%). People married before the injury report less happy marriages and worse sexual adjustment than those married after, possibly indicating that spouses had difficulty adjusting to the new circumstances. For those who chose to become involved with someone after an injury, the <a href="disability">disability</a> was an accepted part of the relationship from the outset. Understanding and acceptance of the limitations that result from the injury on the part of the uninjured partner is an important factor in a successful marriage. Many divorces have been found to be initiated by the injured partner, sometimes due to the depression and denial that often occurs early after the injury. Thus counseling is important, not just for managing changes in self-perception but in perceptions about relationships.
Despite the stresses that SCI places on people and relationships, studies have shown that people with SCI are able to have happy and fulfilling romantic relationships and marriages, and to raise well-adjusted children. People with SCI who wish to be parents may question their ability to raise children and opt not to have them, but studies have shown no difference in parenting outcomes between injured and uninjured groups. Children of women with SCI do not have worse self-esteem, adjustment, or attitudes toward their parents. Women who have children post-SCI have a higher quality of life, even though parenting adds demands and challenges to their lives.
For those who are single when injured or who become single, SCI causes difficulties and insecurities with respect to one's ability to meet new partners and start relationships. In some settings, <a href="Physical%20attractiveness">beauty standards</a> cause people to view disabled bodies as less attractive, limiting the options for sexual and romantic partners of people with disabilities like SCI. Furthermore, physical disabilities are stigmatized, causing people to avoid contact with disabled people, particularly those with highly visible conditions like SCI. The stigma may cause people with SCI to experience self-consciousness and embarrassment in public. They can increase their social success by using <a href="impression%20management">impression management</a> techniques to change how they are perceived and create a more positive image of themselves in others' eyes. Physical limitations create difficulties; with lowered independence comes reduced social interaction and fewer opportunities to find partners. Difficulties with mobility and the lack of disabled <a href="accessibility">accessibility</a> of social spaces (e.g. lack of wheelchair ramps) create a further barrier to social activity and limit the ability to meet partners. Isolation and its associated risk of depression can be limited by participating in physical activities, social gatherings, clubs, and online chat and dating.

Negative societal attitudes and <a href="stereotype">stereotype</a>s about people with disabilities like SCI affect interpersonal interactions and self-image, with important implications for quality of life. In fact, for women, psychological factors have a more important impact on sexual adjustment and activity than physical ones. Negative attitudes about disability (along with relationships and social support) are more predictive of outcome than even the level or completeness of injury. Stereotypes exist that people with SCI (particularly women) are uninterested in, unsuitable for, or incapable of sexual relationships or encounters. "People think we can only date people in wheelchairs, that we're lucky to get any guy, that we can't be picky", remarked Mia Schaikewitz, who is profiled in "<a href="Push%20Girls">Push Girls</a>", a 2012 reality series about four women with SCI.

Not only do they affect injured people's self-image, these stereotypes are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation. Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, particularly if the injury occurred at a young age and the patient never had sexual experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and <a href="reproductive%20health">sexual health</a>-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance of the rest of the body and of the individual.
Cultural attitudes toward gender roles have profound effects on people with SCI. The injury can cause insecurities surrounding <a href="sexual%20identity">sexual identity</a>, particularly if the disability precludes fulfilment of societally taught gender norms.

Female beauty standards propagated by mass media and culture portray the ideal woman as able bodied: as one fashion model with a SCI commented, "when you have a devastating injury or disability, you're not often thought of as sensual or pretty because you don't look like the women in the magazines." Inability to meet these standards can lower self-esteem, even if these ideals are also unattainable for most able-bodied women. Poorer self-esteem is associated with worse sexual adjustment and quality of life, and higher rates of loneliness, stress, and depression.

Males are also affected by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure that emphasizes the ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who are not able to perform sexually may be at increased risk for <a href="major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a>, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.

The Wrestlers (Etty)

The Wrestlers is an <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> on <a href="paperboard">millboard</a> by English artist <a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a>, painted around 1840 and currently in the <a href="York%20Art%20Gallery">York Art Gallery</a>, in <a href="York">York</a>, England. It depicts a <a href="wrestling">wrestling</a> match between a black man and a white man, both glistening with sweat and under an intense light emphasising their curves and musculature. While little documentation of the painting exists prior to 1947, it is likely that it was painted over a period of three evenings at the <a href="Figure%20drawing">life class</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a>.

The Royal Academy had moved to new premises in <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a> in 1837, and the studio used by the life class was cramped and hot, a fact thought to account for the sweatiness of the central figures. Etty was best known for his painting of nude or near-nude women in historical and mythological settings but had also painted men involved in various forms of combat.

In the period in which "The Wrestlers" was painted, sports were becoming increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical <a href="Hellenism%20%28neoclassicism%29">Hellenistic</a> works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to <a href="Sociology%20of%20race%20and%20ethnic%20relations">race relations</a>. Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and it is not clear whether he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.

Although "The Wrestlers" was probably exhibited as part of a major retrospective of Etty's work in 1849, it then went into a private collection and was not publicly exhibited again for almost a century. In 1947 it was put on sale; with little interest from commercial galleries owing to its subject, it was bought for the bargain price of 30 <a href="guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a> by the York Art Gallery, where it remains. The painting formed a part of major exhibitions in 2002 and 2011–12.

<a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a> (1787–1849), the seventh son of a <a href="York">York</a> baker and miller, had originally been an apprentice printer in <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>, but on completing his seven-year apprenticeship in 1805 moved to <a href="London">London</a> to become an artist. In January 1807 he was admitted to the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy Schools</a> as a probationer, and in July of that year became a student of renowned portrait painter <a href="Thomas%20Lawrence">Thomas Lawrence</a>, studying under him for a year.

Strongly influenced by the works of <a href="Titian">Titian</a> and <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Rubens</a>, Etty became famous for painting <a href="Nude%20%28art%29">nude figures</a> in biblical, literary and mythological settings. He became well-respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Many of his peers greatly admired his work, and in February 1828 he defeated <a href="John%20Constable">John Constable</a> by 18 votes to five to become a full <a href="Royal%20Academician">Royal Academician</a>, at the time the highest honour available to an artist.

Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 depicted nude figures. While some nude paintings by foreign artists existed in private collections in England, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Suppression%20of%20Vice">Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice</a>.

Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and the prurient reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received, many critics condemned his recurrent depictions of female nudity as indecent.

"The Wrestlers" is an <a href="oil%20study">oil study</a> from life, depicting a black and a white wrestler <a href="grappling">grappling</a>. Although at first glance the white wrestler appears to be dominant, the figures are in fact equally matched; this was unusual for the time, as it was a common belief in Britain in this period that black people were physically weaker than whites. Showing the subjects under bright light, the painting is a combination of intense juxtapositions between intimacy and violence, dark and light skin, and hard and soft surfaces. The black wrestler is naked; the white wrestler wears a <a href="loincloth">loincloth</a>, although it is possible that this was added after Etty's death. The intense light casts deep shadows, emphasising the curves and musculature of the wrestlers' bodies, as the skin of the two combatants is stretched and distorted under the pressure of the grapple. The figures are set against a dark green curtain and a brown wall, rather than in a wrestling ring.

The identity of the wrestlers is not known. Alison Smith, Lead Curator of British Art to 1900 at <a href="Tate">Tate</a>, speculates that the white figure may have been John Wilton of Somerset, who had possibly been the model for <a href="Little%20John">Little John</a> in <a href="Daniel%20Maclise">Daniel Maclise</a>'s 1839 "Robin Hood and His Merry Men Entertaining Richard the Lionheart in Sherwood Forest". The figures glisten with sweat. Art historian Sarah Victoria Turner speculates that this is not simply for dramatic effect, but reflects the fact that after the Royal Academy's 1837 move to its new building in <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a> the studio used by the life class was a cramped and poorly ventilated room lit by <a href="gas%20lighting">gaslight</a>, which when crowded with students and with the lights on could become extremely hot.
"The Wrestlers" is thought to have been painted in around 1840. It is likely that it was executed at the Royal Academy's <a href="life%20class">life class</a>; despite his senior status, Etty continued to attend there throughout his life. While students at the class usually worked from a single model, Etty would occasionally arrange for "a Treat", in which a group of models would be used to create an entire composition for the students to sketch (often arranged in poses derived from <a href="Old%20Master">Old Master</a> paintings). Painted on <a href="paperboard">millboard</a>, "The Wrestlers" was probably executed over the course of three evenings. On the first evening Etty would have drawn the models in <a href="chalk">chalk</a> or <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a> and inked the outline; on the second evening the figures would have been painted in <a href="oil%20paint">oil paint</a>, and on the third evening a thin <a href="Glaze%20%28painting%20technique%29">glaze</a> would have been applied to the painting to which colour would then have been added.

Although best known for his paintings of women, Etty had also produced paintings of nude or semi-nude men engaged in combat, such as 1829's "Benaiah". There was a tendency among British artists in this period to attempt to illustrate the physiques of strong and well-proportioned living men, as an indication that the best of British manhood had reached or surpassed the <a href="Hellenism%20%28neoclassicism%29">Hellenistic ideal</a> which at that time was considered the model of perfection. Almost all artists, as part of their training, would be expected to draw from reproductions of classical statues in British museums, or to visit Italy and Greece to view the originals "in situ". Etty, and other British artists of the day, would have been familiar with the technical issues of drawing men wrestling, as the "<a href="Wrestlers%20%28sculpture%29">Uffizi Wrestlers</a>" (the "Pancrastinae") was one of the subjects new entrants to the Royal Academy Schools were required to draw. Etty had also made lengthy visits to France and Italy in 1816, 1822–24 and 1830 to view and sketch the paintings and statuary of those countries, with additional visits to Belgium in 1840 and 1841 to view the works of <a href="Rubens">Rubens</a>, whom he greatly admired. 

Moreover, as the <a href="industrial%20revolution">industrial revolution</a> took hold and the prevalence of manual labour declined, there were increasing concerns that British men would become unfit and undisciplined; images of sport and combat were thought to motivate the viewer to aspire to an ideal of physical strength which people were worried was becoming lost. Wrestling and boxing thus were popular subjects for artworks, and Etty had produced other paintings and sketches of men engaged in fights of one kind or another. It had become common for artists to use boxers and soldiers as models, as they had the strength and bearing considered desirable, and the discipline to hold a pose for long periods in the studio.

The motivation behind Etty's choice to pair a black and a white wrestler is not clear. Etty had painted black and <a href="Indian%20people">Indian</a> subjects in the past, and it was not unusual in that period for artists to use non-white models, but it was rare to show a black and a white figure embracing. It is possible that he was simply interested in the contrast between the flesh tones; it is documented that he would sometimes arrange models of different skin colours for that reason. It is also possible that he saw "primitive" black men as closer in spirit or physique to the wrestlers of the classical civilisations. Sarah Victoria Turner argues that combat was the only subject in which it would have been felt appropriate at the time to depict naked black and white figures in intimate closeness.

1840, the year in which "The Wrestlers" is likely to have been painted, saw the <a href="World%20Anti-Slavery%20Convention">World Anti-Slavery Convention</a> in London and the London exhibition of "<a href="The%20Slave%20Ship">The Slave Ship</a>" and "", and race relations had become a major social and political issue. While black wrestlers and boxers—often former slaves from the United States or their descendants—were not unusual in England in the period, and the former slave <a href="Tom%20Molineaux">Tom Molineaux</a> had twice challenged for the boxing world championship in 1811, they were still treated with suspicion by many members of the public.

Virtually no contemporary records or reviews of "The Wrestlers" exist, and it was probably sold to a private collector either on its completion or in the sale of over 800 works found in Etty's studio following his death; Dennis Farr's 1958 biography of Etty lists the painting exhibited in 1849 as "lent by C. W. Wass". "The Wrestlers" was probably exhibited at the June 1849 <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Royal Society of Arts</a> retrospective of over 130 works by Etty, shortly before his death on 13 November of that year. (Etty produced three paintings entitled "The Wrestlers", and it is not certain which was the one exhibited in 1849, although it is thought likely to be this one.)

Etty died in 1849, and his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity. Interest in him declined over time, and by the end of the 19th century the value of all his paintings had fallen below their original levels. Following his death, nude paintings went out of fashion very rapidly in Britain.
"The Wrestlers" was sold by a private collector on 31 October 1947. Owing to its subject matter there was little interest from commercial galleries, and it was bought by <a href="York%20Civic%20Trust">York Civic Trust</a> for the bargain price of 30 <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a> (£31.50; about £ in 2019 terms). It was immediately presented to the <a href="York%20Art%20Gallery">York Art Gallery</a>, where it remains. The painting was one of five works by Etty exhibited in <a href="Tate%20Britain">Tate Britain</a>'s 2002 exhibition "Exposed: The Victorian Nude", and was a central component of a major retrospective of Etty's work at the York Art Gallery in 2011–12.

Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball

Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball, also known as The Misses Williams-Wynn, is a <a href="oil%20painting">oil on canvas</a> by English artist <a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a>, first exhibited in 1835 and currently in the <a href="York%20Art%20Gallery">York Art Gallery</a>. Although Etty was then known almost exclusively for <a href="history%20painting">history painting</a>s featuring <a href="Nude%20%28art%29">nude</a> figures, he was commissioned in 1833 by <a href="Welsh%20people">Welsh</a> <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> politician <a href="Charles%20Williams-Wynn%20%281775%E2%80%931850%29">Charles Watkin Williams-Wynn</a> to paint a portrait of two of his daughters. "Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball" shows Williams-Wynn's daughters, <a href="Charlotte%20Williams-Wynn%20%28diarist%29">Charlotte</a> and Mary, in lavish Italian-style costume: Charlotte, the eldest, is shown standing, helping the seated Mary decorate her hair with a ribbon and a rose. Etty put a good deal of effort into the piece and took much longer than usual to finish it.

The painting was completed for and exhibited at the 1835 <a href="Royal%20Academy%20Summer%20Exhibition">Royal Academy Summer Exhibition</a>. It was generally well received, even by critics usually hostile to Etty and his work. "Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball" demonstrated that Etty was both capable of high-quality work and deserving of patronage by the English elite, and the success led to further commissions. The painting remained in the collection of Mary Williams-Wynn's descendants, and other than an 1849 retrospective exhibition, was not shown publicly for 160 years. A private collector purchased the piece from the Williams-Wynn family in 1982, where it remained until its 2009 acquisition by the York Art Gallery. It now forms part of a major collection of Etty's work there.

<a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a>, the son of a <a href="York">York</a> baker and miller, began as an apprentice printer in <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>. On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved to London at the age of 18, with the intention of becoming a <a href="history%20painting">history painter</a> in the tradition of the <a href="Old%20Masters">Old Masters</a>. Strongly influenced by the works of <a href="Titian">Titian</a> and <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Rubens</a>, he submitted paintings to the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts">Royal Academy of Arts</a> and the <a href="British%20Institution">British Institution</a>, all of which were either rejected or received scant attention when exhibited.

In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works, "<a href="The%20Arrival%20of%20Cleopatra%20in%20Cilicia">The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia</a>" (also known as "The Triumph of Cleopatra"). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts%23Membership">Royal Academician</a> in 1828, ahead of <a href="John%20Constable">John Constable</a>. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of "Cleopatra", Etty tried over the next decade to replicate its success by painting <a href="Nude%20%28art%29">nude figures</a> in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 depicted nude figures.

Some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, but Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Suppression%20of%20Vice">Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice</a>. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and the reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received. (Etty's male nude portraits were primarily of mythological heroes and classical combat, genres in which the depiction of male nudity was considered acceptable in England.) From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks from the press, Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes but made conscious efforts to try to reflect moral lessons in his work.

Although he was almost exclusively known at the time for painting nudes, Etty was commissioned in 1833 by Thomas Potts of <a href="Clapham%20Common">Clapham Common</a> to paint a portrait of his daughter Elizabeth. Potts paid him 65 <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a> (£68.25; about £ in 2019 terms) for the piece. Etty exhibited "Elizabeth Potts" at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20Summer%20Exhibition">Royal Academy Summer Exhibition</a> of 1834 under the title of "A Portrait", as the subject's mother requested her identity be kept secret. As he had been too ill to paint for much of the period preceding the exhibition he only exhibited one other picture there, "The Cardinal".

"Elizabeth Potts" was poorly received by critics. Etty's admirers were angered by his apparent abandonment of history painting for the then poorly regarded field of <a href="portrait%20painting">portrait painting</a>, while Etty's critics felt he had demonstrated that he did not have the technical skills to produce high quality portraits, and was simply trying to use his name to make money in the more lucrative field of portraiture. History paintings were generally sold at exhibition for no less than the asking price, and as a consequence often remained unsold. Portraits were commissioned by the subject or their family, providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist. History painting was much more highly regarded as an art form; portrait painting was seen as reflecting nature whereas history painting involved more creativity and also gave the artist the opportunity to tell moral lessons.

Etty retained close connections with York throughout his life. After <a href="Jonathan%20Martin%20%28arsonist%29">Jonathan Martin</a>'s arson attack on <a href="York%20Minster">York Minster</a> in 1829 caused major damage, Etty was prominent in the effort to restore the building to its original state. One of his colleagues in that campaign was Welsh politician <a href="Charles%20Williams-Wynn%20%281775%E2%80%931850%29">Charles Watkin Williams-Wynn</a>, the long-serving <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="Montgomeryshire%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Montgomeryshire</a>.

In late 1833 Etty was commissioned by Williams-Wynn to paint a portrait of two of his seven children. "Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball" depicts Williams-Wynn's daughters <a href="Charlotte%20Williams-Wynn%20%28diarist%29">Charlotte</a> and Mary, dressing up in lavish Italian-style costume. Although their dress is generally described as Italian, Dennis Farr's 1958 biography of Etty speculates that elements of the costumes were possibly intended to be Russian, based on Charlotte's headdress. The Italian-style clothing likely represents the high level of interest in Italian culture in early 19th-century England. The popularity of the style of music now known as "<a href="bel%20canto">bel canto</a>", widely associated with Italy, was at its peak; likewise, the Italian plays of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> had become extremely popular in the period. Etty, who had spent a good deal of time in Venice and other Italian cities, would have been very familiar with Italian clothing designs, and the costumes worn by the Williams-Wynn sisters closely resemble those of women in Venetian scenes painted by Etty, such as 1831's "Window in Venice, During a Fiesta". As art historian Leonard Robinson points out, despite the title the sisters are not in fact shown preparing for the ball, but are fully dressed. The style of the work reflects that of <a href="Thomas%20Lawrence">Thomas Lawrence</a>, who had been Etty's teacher in 1807–08, as well as that of <a href="Joshua%20Reynolds">Joshua Reynolds</a>, of whom Etty was a great admirer and of whose works Etty had often made copies as an exercise.
The sisters are depicted in three-quarter length portrait; Charlotte, the eldest, stands and helps Mary, who is seated, to decorate her hair with a ribbon and a rose. Their arrangement is similar to the positioning of the central female figures of Etty's "The Lute Player", painted around the same time, and Farr views "Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball" as a direct continuation of the theme of that work. ("The Lute Player" was exhibited at the British Institution in early 1835 alongside <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">Turner</a>'s "<a href="The%20Burning%20of%20the%20Houses%20of%20Lords%20and%20Commons">The Burning of the Houses of Lords and Commons</a>", and was somewhat overshadowed by it. "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>" commented that in comparison to the vibrant colours of the Turner, "The Lute Player" looked "as if mud had been the vehicle of the pigment".)

The painting's depiction of preparation for a <a href="fancy%20dress%20party">fancy dress party</a> would have been familiar to Etty's generally wealthy audience. In both London and the English provincial cities, such balls and parties had become extremely fashionable by the 1830s. Though conservative in comparison to some costumes worn at contemporary fancy dress events, the richness of the design of the sisters' dress indicates the high status of the Williams-Wynn family in fashionable circles.

"Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball" took Etty some time to complete in comparison to his usual work, and he apologized to the sisters for his "inability to render [repeated sittings for him] less tedious". He justified the slowness of the process by saying that he was not simply trying to capture the Williams-Wynn sisters' appearance, but "to make a fine work of Art as well as a resemblance".

"Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball" was one of eight works exhibited by Etty at the 1835 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, the others being "The Bridge of Sighs", "Phaedria and Cymochles on the Idle Lake", "Study from a Young Lady: A York Beauty", "Study of the Head of a Youth", "Venus and her Satellites", "The Warrior Arming" and "Wood Nymphs Sleeping: Satyr Bringing Flowers". Art historian Sarah Burnage believes Etty's choice of "Venus and her Satellites" may have been to draw attention to similarities with "Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball" and possibly to link the Williams-Wynn sisters' beauty with the legendary <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a>.

Reviewers, even those usually hostile to Etty, were generally positive about the work, and towards Etty's demonstration of his ability to paint a major piece depicting visual matter that did not depend on nudity or sensuality. "<a href="Leigh%20Hunt%27s%20London%20Journal">Leigh Hunt's London Journal</a>" noted that they were "glad to see him turn his abilities into a channel acknowledgedly more profitable than others are apt to be, and we heartily wish him success in it"; the same reviewer did, however, savagely criticise "Venus and her Satellites" for its gratuitous nudity and a "total absence of soul".

Although Etty painted many private portraits of his friends and acquaintances, he produced very few publicly exhibited portraits, fewer than 30 of which were shown during his lifetime. Portraiture <a href="Hierarchy%20of%20genres">was seen</a> as a vulgar and generally worthless form of painting throughout much of the 19th century, and portrait painters continued to be disparaged as a greedy and unimaginative group who survived by feeding the vanity of the emerging <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a>. Other than "Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball", critics generally disliked his portraits, preferring his history paintings in spite of reservations over his depictions of nudity. "Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball" did, however, serve as an indication that Etty could successfully paint works as commissions for the English elite, boosting his status and leading to further commissions. Etty died in November 1849 and soon fell from fashion; by the late 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. Charlotte Williams-Wynn became a noted letter writer and diarist; Mary Williams-Wynn married Member of Parliament <a href="James%20Milnes%20Gaskell">James Milnes Gaskell</a>. Both Charlotte and Mary died in April 1869.

"Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball" was exhibited in a major retrospective of Etty's works at the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Royal Society of Arts</a> in June 1849, but after that was not exhibited publicly for 160 years. Charlotte Williams-Wynn had died childless, and the painting was inherited by the family of Mary Williams-Wynn. In 1982 it was sold to a private collector by Mary Williams-Wynn's great-granddaughter Mrs Lewis Motley. The <a href="York%20Art%20Gallery">York Art Gallery</a> purchased the work in 2009 for £120,000 with the assistance of the <a href="The%20Art%20Fund">Art Fund</a> and the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">V&A</a>/<a href="Museums%2C%20Libraries%20and%20Archives%20Council">MLA</a> Purchase Grant Fund, and it formed part of a major exhibition of Etty's work at the York Art Gallery in 2011–12.

Musidora: The Bather 'At the Doubtful Breeze Alarmed'

Musidora: The Bather 'At the Doubtful Breeze Alarmed', also known as The Bather, is a name given to four nearly identical <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a>s on canvas by English artist <a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a>. The paintings illustrate a scene from <a href="James%20Thomson%20%28poet%2C%20born%201700%29">James Thomson</a>'s 1727 poem "<a href="The%20Seasons%20%28Thomson%29">Summer</a>" in which a young man accidentally sees a young woman bathing naked, and is torn between his desire to look and his knowledge that he ought to look away. The scene was popular with English artists as it was one of the few legitimate pretexts to paint <a href="nude%20%28art%29">nude</a>s at a time when the display and distribution of nude imagery was suppressed.

Other than minor differences in the background landscape, the four paintings are identical in composition. The first version was exhibited in 1843. Two versions are in public collections, one in <a href="Tate%20Britain">Tate Britain</a> and one in the <a href="Manchester%20Art%20Gallery">Manchester Art Gallery</a>; one of these was painted in 1844 and first exhibited in 1846 and the other was painted at around the same time; it is not known which is the version exhibited in 1846. A fourth version is of poorer quality and may be a later copy by a student.

"Musidora" was extremely well received when first exhibited, and considered one of the finest works by an English artist. Etty died in 1849 and his work rapidly went out of fashion. At the same time, the topic of Musidora itself became a cliche, and from the 1870s Thomson's writings faded into obscurity. Etty's "Musidora" is likely to have influenced "The Knight Errant" by <a href="John%20Everett%20Millais">John Everett Millais</a>, but other than that has had little influence on subsequent works. The Tate's version of the painting was exhibited in major exhibitions in 2001–02 in London and in 2011–12 in York.

<a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a> (1787–1849), the seventh child of a <a href="York">York</a> baker and miller, began his career as an apprentice printer in <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a> at the age of 11. On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved to London "with a few pieces of chalk crayons", with the intention of becoming a <a href="history%20painting">history painter</a> in the tradition of the <a href="Old%20Masters">Old Masters</a>, and studied under renowned artist <a href="Thomas%20Lawrence">Thomas Lawrence</a>. Strongly influenced by the works of <a href="Titian">Titian</a> and <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Rubens</a>, Etty submitted numerous paintings to the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts">Royal Academy of Arts</a> and the <a href="British%20Institution">British Institution</a>, all of which were either rejected or received little attention when exhibited.

In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works, "<a href="The%20Arrival%20of%20Cleopatra%20in%20Cilicia">The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia</a>" (also known as "The Triumph of Cleopatra"), which depicted a large number of <a href="Nude%20%28art%29">nude figures</a>. "Cleopatra" was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts%23Membership">Royal Academician</a> in 1828, ahead of <a href="John%20Constable">John Constable</a>. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of "Cleopatra", over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 included nude figures.

While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of such material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Suppression%20of%20Vice">Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice</a>. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in painting nudes, and many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received. From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks from the press, Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes, but made conscious efforts to try to reflect moral lessons in his work.

"Musidora" is based on "", a poem by the Scottish poet and playwright <a href="James%20Thomson%20%28poet%2C%20born%201700%29">James Thomson</a> (best known today as the author of "<a href="Rule%2C%20Britannia%21">Rule, Britannia!</a>"). "Summer" was initially published in 1727 and was republished in an altered form in 1730 along with Thomson's "Winter" (1726), "Spring" (1728) and "Autumn" (1730) as "<a href="The%20Seasons%20%28Thomson%29">The Seasons</a>". Although the individual poems attracted little interest on their release, "The Seasons" proved critically and commercially successful once completed, and Thomson began to associate with important and influential London political and cultural figures. In June 1744 Thomson published a drastically revised version of "The Seasons", which became extremely influential over the following century. <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Joseph Haydn</a> wrote <a href="The%20Seasons%20%28Haydn%29">a major oratorio</a> based on the poem, significant artists including <a href="Thomas%20Gainsborough">Thomas Gainsborough</a>, <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a> and <a href="Richard%20Westall">Richard Westall</a> painted scenes from it, and over 400 editions of "The Seasons" in a number of languages were published between 1744 and 1870.

The painting depicts a scene from "Summer" in which the young Damon sits thinking by a stream on a hot summer's day. The beautiful Musidora strips naked to cool down by bathing in the stream, not knowing that Damon can see her. Damon is torn between his desire to watch her and the "delicate refinement" of knowing he should avert his gaze. Damon decides to respect her modesty and leaves a note on the riverbank reading "Bathe on, my fair, / Yet unbeheld save by the sacred eye / Of faithful love: I go to guard thy haunt; / To keep from thy recess each vagrant foot / And each licentious eye". Musidora sees the paper and panics, but on reading it and realising that it has been written by Damon, feels admiration for his behaviour as well as a surge of pride that her own beauty can provoke such a reaction. She leaves him a note in turn, reading "Dear youth! sole judge of what these verses mean, / By fortune too much favoured, but by love, / Alas! not favoured less, be still as now / Discreet: the time may come you need not fly."
As a nude scene from a major and well respected work of English literature, the theme of Musidora was one of the few pretexts under which mainstream English painters felt able to paint nudes, and Musidora has been described as "the nation's surrogate <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a>". Four versions of "Musidora" attributed to Etty exist in total, the first of which was exhibited at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20Summer%20Exhibition">Royal Academy Summer Exhibition</a> in 1843. The best known version is that now in <a href="Tate%20Britain">Tate Britain</a>, painted in 1844 and probably first exhibited at the <a href="British%20Institution">British Institution</a> in 1846. The four paintings are identical in composition, although the landscape background varies slightly. One of the paintings is of poorer quality, and may be a later copy by a student.

The painting shows the moment from "Summer" in which Musidora, having removed the last of her clothes, steps into "the lucid coolness of the flood" to "bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream". Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as "a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome".

The pose of Musidora is based on that of the <a href="Aphrodite%20of%20Cnidus">Aphrodite of Cnidus</a> and the <a href="Venus%20de%27%20Medici">Venus de' Medici</a>. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's "Musidora", which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's "Musidora", his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner <a href="Robert%20Vernon%20%28art%20patron%29">Robert Vernon</a> and may have seen it in his collection.
The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of <a href="Acomb%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Acomb</a>, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.

Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for "Musidora" he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of <a href="classical%20mythology">classical mythology</a>, and took place in brightly lit Mediterranean settings. "The Seasons", by contrast, was seen as an explicitly English work, requiring a more muted palette to deal with the typical lighting conditions of Yorkshire.

Both exhibited versions met with great acclaim, and "Musidora" was Etty's most successful painting of a single nude figure. "<a href="La%20Belle%20Assembl%C3%A9e">The Court Magazine and Monthly Critic</a>" called the 1843 version "One of the most delicate and beautiful female figures in the entire gallery", saying that "no hues can be more natural—more Titianesque, if we may so speak." "<a href="The%20Literary%20Gazette">The Literary Gazette</a>" called the version exhibited in 1846 "by far his finest work of art", comparing the piece favourably to <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a> and in particularly praising Etty's ability to capture shadows and reflections in water, where "in the management of these effects [reflections and shadows] Etty has no superior, and very few equals, in any school, from the earliest dawn of art". "<a href="The%20Critic%20%28magazine%29">The Critic</a>" described it as "a preeminent work" and "the triumph of the British school".

Leonard Robinson argues that the popularity of "Musidora" reflects a change in art buyers. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the primary market for art was no longer a privately educated <a href="landed%20aristocracy">landed aristocracy</a> who had been taught the <a href="Classics">Classics</a> and were familiar with ancient mythology, but the emerging middle class. These new buyers lacked the classical education to understand the references in history paintings, but could appreciate "Musidora" as a skilful execution and as a work of beauty in its own right.

By the time Etty exhibited "Musidora", the theme was becoming something of a cliche, such that by 1850 it was described by "The Literary Gazette" as "a favourite subject for a dip of the brush". As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by <a href="Lady%20Godiva">Lady Godiva</a>, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to <a href="Alfred%2C%20Lord%20Tennyson">Alfred, Lord Tennyson</a>'s poem "<a href="Godiva%20%28poem%29">Godiva</a>". After the death of <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a> in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than "Rule, Britannia!" were little known.

When Etty died in 1849, despite having worked and exhibited until his death, he was still regarded by many as a pornographer. <a href="Charles%20Robert%20Leslie">Charles Robert Leslie</a> observed shortly after Etty's death that himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds". Interest in him declined as <a href="Victorian%20painting">new movements</a> came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen.
It is likely that the composition and style of <a href="John%20Everett%20Millais">John Everett Millais</a>'s controversial "The Knight Errant" was influenced by "Musidora", but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator <a href="William%20Edward%20Frost">William Edward Frost</a>, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28British%20magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>" commented on "Musidora" that "I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing." By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word "<a href="Victorian%20morality">Victorian</a>" had become a derogatory term. <a href="Frederick%20Mentone">Frederick Mentone</a>'s "The Human Form in Art" (1944) was one of the few 20th-century academic works to favourably view "Musidora".

The 1843 "Musidora" was bought directly from Etty by <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a> merchant George Knott for 70 <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a> (about £ in today's terms) who sold it on two years later for 225 guineas (about £ today). It has passed through the hands of a number of private collectors since, remaining in private collections until at least 1948. As well as its 1843 exhibition at the Royal Academy, it was exhibited at an 1849 retrospective of Etty's work at the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Society of Arts</a>, and at the Royal Academy's 1889 "Old Masters" exhibition.

It is not clear which "Musidora" was exhibited at the British Institution in 1846. The <a href="Tate%20Britain">Tate Britain</a> version was bought from Etty for an unknown sum by <a href="Jacob%20Bell%20%28chemist%29">Jacob Bell</a>. It was exhibited in Etty's 1849 Society of Arts retrospective, but was described as "not previously exhibited". It was bequeathed to the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a> by <a href="Jacob%20Bell%20%28chemist%29">Jacob Bell</a> in 1859, and transferred to the <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a> (now Tate Britain) in 1900. In 2001–02 this painting was shown as part of Tate Britain's "Exposed: The Victorian Nude" exhibition, and exhibited in 2011–12 as part of a major retrospective of Etty's work at the <a href="York%20Art%20Gallery">York Art Gallery</a>.

An almost identical version, which is possibly that originally exhibited in 1846, was bequeathed in 1917 to the <a href="Manchester%20Art%20Gallery">Manchester Art Gallery</a>, where it remains. Another version, again almost identical to the Tate and Manchester paintings, is in a private collection; it is of poorer quality, and is possibly a copy by a 19th-century student.

Rare Replay is a 2015 compilation of 30 <a href="video%20games">video games</a> from the 30-year history of <a href="video%20game%20developer">developers</a> <a href="Rare%20%28company%29">Rare</a> and its predecessor, <a href="Ultimate%20Play%20the%20Game">Ultimate Play the Game</a>. The <a href="Video%20game%20console%20emulator">emulated</a> games span multiple genres and <a href="video%20game%20console">consoles</a>—from the <a href="ZX%20Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> to the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>—and retain the features and errors of their original releases with minimal edits. The compilation adds <a href="Cheating%20in%20video%20games">cheats</a> to make the older games easier and a Snapshots mode of specific challenges culled from parts of the games. Player progress is rewarded with <a href="making-of">behind-the-scenes</a> footage and interviews about Rare's major and unreleased games.

The compilation was one of several ideas Rare considered to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Inspired by fans, upcoming <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> <a href="backward%20compatibility">backward compatibility</a> features, and a desire to link Rare's past and future, the company sorted through 120 games to choose titles that best represented its oeuvre. It prioritized games with characters and environments original to the company. Rare incorporated six hardware emulators in the package, and worked with its parent company, <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, to use its unannounced <a href="List%20of%20Xbox%20360%20games%20compatible%20with%20Xbox%20One">Xbox 360 emulation</a>. "Rare Replay" released worldwide as an Xbox One exclusive on August 4, 2015.

"Rare Replay" reviews were generally favorable. Critics appreciated the package's design and craft and called the release a new pinnacle for compilation releases. They commended its "rewind" and Snapshot features, but criticized technical issues in the Xbox 360 emulation and game installation. Among its games, reviewers preferred Rare's <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a> classics, especially "<a href="Blast%20Corps">Blast Corps</a>", and disliked "<a href="Perfect%20Dark%20Zero">Perfect Dark Zero</a>", "<a href="Grabbed%20by%20the%20Ghoulies">Grabbed by the Ghoulies</a>", and the Spectrum games. Some reviewers were disappointed by the absence of the "<a href="Donkey%20Kong%20Country%20%28series%29">Donkey Kong Country</a>" series and "<a href="GoldenEye%20007%20%281997%20video%20game%29">GoldenEye 007</a>" due to inevitable <a href="brand%20licensing">licensing</a> problems, while a few thought the package was fine without them. Critics deemed the archival game content and developer interviews as among the compilation's best features, but were upset to see the content hidden behind time-consuming in-game challenges. "Rare Replay" became Rare's first United Kingdom all-format charts bestseller since "<a href="Banjo-Kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>" in 1998.

"Rare Replay" is a compilation of 30 games developed by <a href="Rare%20%28company%29">Rare</a> and its predecessor, <a href="Ultimate%20Play%20the%20Game">Ultimate Play the Game</a>, over their 30-year history across platforms from the <a href="ZX%20Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> to the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> (1983 to 2008), up until Rare's "<a href="Kinect%20Sports">Kinect Sports</a>" series.

The compilation opens with a <a href="musical%20number">musical number</a> featuring Rare characters. Each game has a landing page with a variation on its <a href="theme%20music">theme music</a>. While the core gameplay remains unedited, Rare added extra features to the older releases. The player can toggle the visual appearance of <a href="scanlines">scanlines</a> and "rewind" up to ten seconds of gameplay in pre-<a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a> games. The older games can be <a href="saved%20game">saved</a> at will and <a href="autosave">autosave</a> progress upon the player's exit.

The "Snapshots" feature presents small segments of the older games as challenges for the player, such as collecting a set amount of <a href="Score%20%28game%29">points</a> in a set amount of time in a set scenario, similar in function to the "<a href="NES%20Remix">NES Remix</a>" series. Some Snapshots are connected sequentially as a <a href="playlist">playlist</a>.

The ZX Spectrum <a href="Video%20game%20console%20emulator">emulation</a> retains the technical idiosyncrasies of the original hardware. For instance, their <a href="video%20game%20graphics">graphics</a> fluctuate in render speed depending on the number of items the computer has to process on-screen. The Nintendo 64 emulation upgrades the games' <a href="Rendering%20%28computer%20graphics%29">polygon rendering</a> and <a href="frame%20rate">frame rate</a>. The nine Xbox 360 releases (and re-releases) install directly to the <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> dashboard separately from the "Rare Replay" compilation, and require online activation before they can be played offline. The Xbox 360 games share player saved game and <a href="Achievement%20%28video%20gaming%29">Achievement</a> progress between the consoles via <a href="Xbox%20Live">Xbox Live</a>'s <a href="Cloud%20computing">cloud</a> sync features. "Rare Replay" uses the prior Xbox 360 <a href="Porting%20of%20video%20games">ports</a> of "<a href="Banjo-Kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>", "<a href="Banjo-Tooie">Banjo-Tooie</a>", and "<a href="Perfect%20Dark">Perfect Dark</a>" rather than emulating their originals. However, Rare chose to emulate the original "<a href="Conker%27s%20Bad%20Fur%20Day">Conker's Bad Fur Day</a>" rather than using . "<a href="Grabbed%20by%20the%20Ghoulies">Grabbed by the Ghoulies</a>" runs natively on the Xbox One, as a port upgraded its <a href="display%20resolution">display resolution</a> and frame rate. "Rare Replay" retains the <a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game">local</a> and <a href="Multiplayer%20online%20game">online multiplayer</a> modes of the original games, and includes their main <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> add-ons. Multiple classic Rare titles, such as the "<a href="Donkey%20Kong%20Country%20%28series%29">Donkey Kong Country</a>" series and "<a href="GoldenEye%20007%20%281997%20video%20game%29">GoldenEye 007</a>", are not included in the compilation due to <a href="brand%20licensing">licensing</a> issues.

A bonus feature section, "Rare Revealed", contains over an hour of behind-the-scenes footage focusing on Rare's major and unreleased games. The player completes in-game challenges to collect stamps, which increase the player's rank and <a href="unlockable%20%28gaming%29">unlock</a> the bonus features; to collect all the stamps, the player has to finish every game. The compilation automatically grants stamps for prior progress in the package's Xbox 360 games. Current and former Rare employees, such as <a href="Grant%20Kirkhope">Grant Kirkhope</a>, feature in the documentary clips, though studio founders <a href="Stamper%20brothers">Tim and Chris Stamper</a> do not appear. Rare Revealed unveils gameplay footage from several unreleased games: for example, in the <a href="open%20world">open world</a> adventure game "Black Widow", the player controls a spider-like robot equipped with missiles. The spider was expected to be recycled in "<a href="Kameo%202">Kameo 2</a>", an unreleased sequel to "<a href="Kameo">Kameo</a>" which was designed with a darker tone than the original. Rare also worked on "The Fast and the Furriest", a <a href="spiritual%20successor">spiritual successor</a> to "<a href="Diddy%20Kong%20Racing">Diddy Kong Racing</a>" with vehicle customization and track alterations. The company's other planned intellectual properties included the <a href="survival%20game">survival game</a> prototype "Sundown" and the airplane-based "Tailwind". The "Rare Revealed" videos include trivia behind some <a href="game%20design">game design</a> decisions such as "Blast Corps" character design, the fate of "Banjo-Kazooie" Stop 'n' Swop features, and audio overrides built into "<a href="Killer%20Instinct%20%281994%20video%20game%29">Killer Instinct</a>". Additional Rare Revealed featurettes not present in "Rare Replay" have been released since the game's launch via the company's official <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> channel.

Rare began work on "Rare Replay" in 2014 as a 30th anniversary celebration. The company wanted to do something unique for what they considered a rare milestone in the industry. Rare was also influenced by community requests to bring their classics to Xbox One, and by the Microsoft backward-compatibility team's progress on the feature. The compilation was one of several celebration ideas, but once it was chosen, the "30 years" theme led to the 30 game limit and price point. As reflective of the company's character and celebratory theme, Rare chose a <a href="papercraft">papercraft</a> art style and <a href="Stage%20%28theatre%29">theatrical stage</a> setting for the compilation. "Rare Replay" became part of Rare's plan to simultaneously celebrate its past and introduce its future with a logo redesign, new website, and announcement of their upcoming game, "<a href="Sea%20of%20Thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>". To select the final 30 games, Rare sorted through 120 games in their catalog. They rated each title for fitness and prioritized those that featured characters and environments original to the company, choosing to exclude those based on licensed intellectual properties. Secondarily, Rare considered whether licenses were available and whether a title remained fun and playable by modern standards. They wanted a wide and representative sample of "popular games that would hit that nostalgic beat that everyone likes". Rare chose the Nintendo 64 "Conker's Bad Fur Day" over the Xbox version ("Conker: Live & Reloaded") because they felt the latter had strayed too far from the original. While "Rare Replay" designers made the final call, other Rare employees and veterans gave input and recollected old game development stories.

Unlike the usual product development cycle, which grows a concept into a final product, most of the development work in "Rare Replay" was in converging 30 games across six platforms onto one disc. The engineering challenge lay in the quantity of games and platforms being emulated rather than the emulation effort itself. Rare worked in close collaboration with Microsoft, who were secretly developing the <a href="List%20of%20Xbox%20360%20games%20compatible%20with%20Xbox%20One">Xbox One's backward-compatibility features</a>, which Rare ultimately used in "Rare Replay". The Microsoft team helped prepare Rare's nine Xbox 360 games for the release. Their discontinued online services were not restored for the compilation. On "Rare Replay" design, lead designer Paul Collins added that the Snapshot challenges were built to encourage players to sample all of the games, and that the rewind feature was to help all players finish the games without quitting in frustration. The compilation's opening musical number was a compromise from the original vision: a musical history of the company's oeuvre, as told through small musical introductions to each Snapshot. The final opening was intended to evoke players' memories of Rare properties, and includes several <a href="Easter%20egg%20%28video%20games%29">Easter eggs</a>.

"Rare Replay" was announced during the Microsoft press conference at the June <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%202015">2015</a> <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a>. The reveal was leaked in the hours prior to the show. The compilation was released as an Xbox One exclusive worldwide on August 4, 2015. There are no plans for a <a href="Windows%2010">Windows 10</a> release or downloadable content additions. While Rare's founders, the Stamper brothers, were not interviewed in the bonus features, Tim Stamper appeared in a "<a href="Develop%20%28magazine%29">Develop</a>" interview set to coincide with the compilation's release. Rare also added a <a href="tie-in">tie-in</a> wherein "Rare Replay" owners unlocked the <a href="Battletoads%20%28characters%29">"Battletoads" character</a> <a href="Rash%20%28character%29">Rash</a> as a playable character in the 2013 fighting game "<a href="Killer%20Instinct%20%282013%20video%20game%29">Killer Instinct</a>" during a limited test period.

"Rare Replay" received "generally favorable" reviews, according to <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. It reached the top of the United Kingdom all-format games sales charts—the first Xbox One exclusive to do so and Rare's first since "Banjo-Kazooie" in 1998. "Rare Replay" was also the first top-ranked budget title since "<a href="Wii%20Fit%20Plus">Wii Fit Plus</a>" (2009) before it fell to sixth place the next week. "Rare Replay" was the sixth best selling game in North America for August 2015. The compilation had earlier been <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>'s most preordered game of the 2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Reviewers liked its <a href="Value%20%28marketing%29">value proposition</a> and low price. Many of the compilation's games already had long-established legacies, such that gamers who experienced the originals in their heyday—the target audience—were unlikely to be swayed by critical reviews of the selections.

Reviewers noted the quality and craft that went into the compilation's design. <a href="Jaz%20Rignall">Jaz Rignall</a> ("<a href="USgamer">USgamer</a>") was impressed by the compilation's presentation and balance between frills and efficiency, and Dan Whitehead ("<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>") felt that the theatrical theme fit Rare's character. Reviewers considered "Rare Replay" a high-water mark for <a href="video%20game%20compilation">video game compilation</a>s—"<a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a>" called it the best since <a href="Valve%20Corporation">Valve</a>'s "<a href="The%20Orange%20Box">The Orange Box</a>". On the other hand, Jeremy Parish ("USgamer") found the contemporaneous "<a href="Mega%20Man%20Legacy%20Collection">Mega Man Legacy Collection</a>" <a href="Criterion%20Collection">Criterion Collection</a>-style presentation to be a more authentic appreciation of its original material. Chris Plante ("<a href="The%20Verge">The Verge</a>") saw "Rare Replay" slight hardware improvements and added touches as a viable model for putting retrogames back on the market and slowing the tide of <a href="Video%20game%20piracy">unlicensed downloads</a>.

Much of the commentary on the compilation focused on Rare's choice of selections and concluded that players new and old would find enough new treasures to outweigh the duds. Reviewer favorites included "<a href="Blast%20Corps">Blast Corps</a>", "", the "<a href="Viva%20Pi%C3%B1ata">Viva Piñata</a>" games, and the Nintendo 64 classics (especially "Banjo-Kazooie", "Conker", and "Perfect Dark"). Among the least favorites were "<a href="Perfect%20Dark%20Zero">Perfect Dark Zero</a>", "Grabbed by the Ghoulies", and the early Spectrum games, which reviewers felt had aged the worst. "<a href="Ars%20Technica">Ars Technica</a>", however, defended the Spectrum titles for showing an experimental and unrefined side of Rare. Many critics regretted the implacable licensing problems that led to the exclusion of what they considered the company's best games—"Donkey Kong Country", "GoldenEye 007", and "Diddy Kong Racing"— while others felt that the package was fine without them. Also omitted were Rare's "Kinect Sports" series, Nintendo franchise releases, <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Nintendo</a>-era games, and ""<a href="Mario%20Kart">Mario Kart</a>" clones". These timeline gaps precluded, for instance, the player from understanding "Conker" as an edgy response to the "cutesy" <a href="Lists%20of%20Nintendo%20characters">characters of preceding Nintendo games</a>. Despite these absences, "Ars Technica" critic was impressed by Microsoft's ability to license from publishers including <a href="Tradewest">Tradewest</a>, Nintendo, <a href="Milton%20Bradley%20Company">Milton Bradley</a>, and <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a>. "Eurogamer" reviewer was surprised by Rare's consistent style across the selections, and compared the company's legacy to that of <a href="Cosgrove%20Hall%20Films">Cosgrove Hall Films</a>. The "Kotaku" reviewer saw "Rare Replay" as "image rehabilitation" that would hopefully mark Rare's return to making "deep and daring games" in line with their historical reputation.

Reviewers felt that the archival game content and developer interviews were among "Rare Replay" best features. Some were frustrated that the features were locked behind time-consuming in-game challenges. Sam Machkovech ("Ars Technica") found himself stuck not even halfway through the stamp card progress after finishing the easiest achievements. This made the unreleased game footage particularly hard to access. Stephen Totilo ("Kotaku") similarly became uninterested in finishing the stamp collection. He called the stamps the package's "sickest joke" in consideration of Rare's reputation for collectible-heavy games. Some reviewers found the developer content more important than individual games. "Polygon" reviewer called the compilation "an essential piece of gaming history", while "Kotaku" critic noted that the features lacked a straightforward history of the company and hid Rare's significant, former ties with Nintendo. Whitehead ("Eurogamer") wondered why "<a href="Mire%20Mare">Mire Mare</a>" and other early games were ignored in the bonus content. Machkovech ("Ars Technica") found "Rare Replay" to be as much a "memorial" as an anthology since Rare had become "a shadow of its former self". He noted how the compilation's final games coincide with the Stamper brothers' exit from the company. Reviewers felt that the Stampers, Rare's founders, were a conspicuous absence from the compilation and Jaz Rignall figured that the compilation's stamps feature was a reference to the brothers.

Reviewers praised the feature by which players could "rewind" time and reattempt difficult sections of ZX Spectrum and Nintendo Entertainment System games, which were known for their difficulty, especially in the notoriously challenging "Battletoads". "Kotaku" figured that Rare added cheats to make the esoteric and "crushingly tough" Spectrum games tolerable, and the "Ars Technica" review wished that this "rewind" feature had been extended to the Nintendo 64 titles. Critics liked the Snapshot challenges and "Polygon" reported that they were crucial for learning basic <a href="game%20mechanics">game mechanics</a>, though less accessible than those of "NES Remix". Reviewers complained that the Spectrum game controls were difficult to decipher. The "Ars Technica" reviewer thought that the compilation did a poor job of explaining each game's controls, and wondered why Rare did not include introductory or how-to videos. Instead, he turned to YouTube videos and external FAQs before playing each game. "Eurogamer" and "Ars Technica" disagreed on the virtues of having the Spectrum emulator replicate the graphical glitches of the original console. Jaz Rignall of "USgamer" appreciated the added option to save game progress at any time for the Spectrum classics, and wrote that the collection will remind players how difficult games used to be.

"Rare Replay" Nintendo 64 emulation pleased critics. "Ars Technica" wrote that the polygonal upgrades compensated for the "blurry" and "pixelated" source material, though the Nintendo 64 multiplayer modes lacked the frame rate upgrades that their single-player modes received. "Kotaku" noted that the Xbox One had more Nintendo 64 re-releases than Nintendo's <a href="Wii%20U%20Virtual%20Console">Wii U Virtual Console</a>. Its reviewer found the in-game Xbox One button prompts to be "delightful <a href="anachronism">anachronism</a>s". "Ars Technica" reviewer commended Rare's choice of the Nintendo 64 version of "Conker's Bad Fur Day" over its updated but censored Xbox re-release. Initial reviews found "Jet Force Gemini" unplayable without dual <a href="Analog%20stick">thumbstick</a> controls, which were later added. While Machkovech ("Ars Technica") considered Rare's Microsoft games to the weakest of the lot, Whitehead ("Eurogamer") found them even more enjoyable in the context of "Rare Replay". Reviewers noted frame rate and technical issues in the Xbox 360 emulation and did not like its separation from the rest of the compilation. Kollar ("Polygon") called the Xbox 360 game installation process needlessly complex, and Marty Sliva ("<a href="IGN">IGN</a>") did not like how the Xbox 360 startup sequence interrupted the compilation's cohesion. He added that the emulated Xbox 360 experience was subpar compared to the unemulated experience.

The World Before the Flood

The World Before the Flood is an <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> on canvas by English artist <a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a>, first exhibited in 1828 and currently in the <a href="Southampton%20City%20Art%20Gallery">Southampton City Art Gallery</a>. It depicts a scene from <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a>'s "<a href="Paradise%20Lost">Paradise Lost</a>" in which, among a series of visions of the future shown to <a href="Adam">Adam</a>, he sees the world immediately before the <a href="Genesis%20flood%20narrative">Great Flood</a>. The painting illustrates the stages of courtship as described by Milton; a group of men select wives from a group of dancing women, drag their chosen woman from the group, and settle down to married life. Behind the courting group, an oncoming storm looms, a symbol of the destruction which the dancers and lovers are about to bring upon themselves.

When first exhibited at the 1828 <a href="Royal%20Academy%20Summer%20Exhibition">Royal Academy Summer Exhibition</a> the painting attracted large crowds, and strongly divided critical opinion. It was greatly praised by many critics, who counted it among the finest works of art in the country. Other reviewers condemned it as crude, tasteless, offensive and poorly executed.

The painting was bought at the Summer Exhibition by <a href="George%20Leveson-Gower%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Sutherland">the Marquess of Stafford</a>. It was sold in 1908, long after Etty had fallen out of fashion, for a substantial loss, and sold again in 1937 for a further substantial loss to the Southampton City Art Gallery, where it remains. Another work by Etty, sold as "A Bacchanalian Scene" in 1830 and later renamed "Landscape with Figures", was identified in 1953 as a preliminary <a href="oil%20sketch">oil sketch</a> for "The World Before the Flood" and purchased by the <a href="York%20Art%20Gallery">York Art Gallery</a>. The two paintings were exhibited together as part of a major retrospective of Etty's work in 2011–12.

<a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a> was born in 1787, the son of a <a href="York">York</a> baker and miller. On 8 October 1798, at the age of 11, he was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Peck of <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>, publisher of local newspaper the "Hull Packet". On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved at the age of 18 to London, with the intention of becoming a <a href="history%20painting">history painter</a> in the tradition of the <a href="Old%20Masters">Old Masters</a>. Strongly influenced by the works of <a href="Titian">Titian</a> and <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Rubens</a>, he submitted paintings to the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts">Royal Academy of Arts</a> and the <a href="British%20Institution">British Institution</a>, all of which were either rejected or received scant attention when exhibited.

In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works, "<a href="The%20Arrival%20of%20Cleopatra%20in%20Cilicia">The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia</a>" (also known as "The Triumph of Cleopatra"). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts%23Membership">Royal Academician</a> in 1828, at that time the most prestigious honour available to an artist. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. In the decade following the exhibition of "Cleopatra" Etty tried to replicate its success by painting <a href="Nude%20%28art%29">nude figures</a> in biblical, literary and mythological settings.

Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of depicting unclothed figures and the display and distribution of such material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Suppression%20of%20Vice">Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice</a>. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in paintings of nudes, and the reaction of uneducated audiences to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of males in a similar state of undress were generally well received.

"The World Before the Flood" illustrates lines 580–97 from Book XI of <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a>'s "<a href="Paradise%20Lost">Paradise Lost</a>". Among the visions of the future the <a href="Michael%20%28archangel%29">Archangel Michael</a> shows to <a href="Adam">Adam</a> is the world after the <a href="Fall%20of%20man">expulsion from the Garden of Eden</a> but before the <a href="Genesis%20flood%20narrative">Great Flood</a>. This section of "Paradise Lost" reflects a passage from the sixth chapter of the <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Book of Genesis</a>: "That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose", an act which would shortly cause God to regret creating humanity and to cleanse the earth in the Great Flood.

The painting shows the stages of courtship as described by Milton, as men are seduced by women and pass from enjoying the company of other men into married life. Etty worked through various configurations for the characters in the painting before settling on his final design.

"The World Before the Flood" is strongly influenced by "A Bacchanalian Revel Before a Term of Pan" (1632–33) by <a href="Nicolas%20Poussin">Nicolas Poussin</a>, whom Etty greatly admired and of whose works he had previously made several copies; this painting had been bought by the National Gallery in 1826. Adam and Michael are not visible in the painting. Instead, the viewer sees the scene from Adam's point of view.
Etty's painting is a <a href="Bacchanalia">Bacchanalia</a>n scene, centred on a group of six scantily-clad women dancing, while a group of men watch. The women's cheeks are flushed both with the exertion of their dancing and with their lustful attempts to seduce the watching men. The men "let their eyes rove without rein", each choosing the woman he wants to be with.

At the left, five men eye the six dancing women. Three of the men discuss their choice of women, while the other two watch the dancing group alone. The male figure closest to the viewer, a seated black man, had previously appeared as a soldier in "The Triumph of Cleopatra". A sixth man has made his choice, and lunges forward to grab the arms of a bare-breasted dancing woman.

In the centre, the women dance. Their interlocked arms and hands create a pattern at the centre of the canvas, which acts as the focus of the painting. To the right of the central group of dancers a young man drags another woman away from the group of dancers, to join a pair of lovers who lie down together at the right of the painting.

Across the entire width of the background, a darkening sky and oncoming storm clouds presage the destruction that the dancers are unwittingly about to bring upon themselves.

In a preliminary study for "The World Before the Flood" now in the <a href="York%20Art%20Gallery">York Art Gallery</a>, the broad structure is similar to that of the finished work, but the focus is more strongly on the central group of women. In Etty's <a href="oil%20sketch">oil sketch</a> and in preliminary drawings the right-most of the dancing figures, wearing a green skirt, faces outward with her arms behind her back, forming a closed circle together with the central group of dancers. In the finished work, she gestures outwards from the circle, creating a clear narrative flow in the positions of the figures: from the single men on the left, to the man choosing a wife, to the group of dancing women, to the couple leaving the circle of dancers to join the reclining lovers on the far right.

As was the case with most of his works, Etty did not give the painting a title. It was initially exhibited as "A Composition, taken from the Eleventh Book of Milton's Paradise Lost", and was referred to by Etty himself as "The Bevy of Fair Women" and "The Origin of Marriage". By 1862, when it was shown at the <a href="1862%20International%20Exhibition">International Exhibition</a>, it had acquired its present title.

Critical opinion concerning "The World Before the Flood" was divided when the painting, along with two other of Etty's works, was exhibited at the 1828 <a href="Royal%20Academy%20Summer%20Exhibition">Royal Academy Summer Exhibition</a>. Some reviewers were intensely critical of the piece. A writer in the "<a href="Literary%20Gazette">Literary Gazette</a>" called the painting a "deadly sin against good taste", describing the background as "unnecessarily harsh and crude" with "much to blame and lament" and the dancing figures "outrageous", complaining that the women reminded him not of "Paradise Lost", but of the scantily clad witches in <a href="Robert%20Burns">Robert Burns</a>'s "<a href="Tam%20o%27%20Shanter%20%28poem%29">Tam o' Shanter</a>".

An anonymous critic in the "<a href="Monthly%20Magazine">Monthly Magazine</a>" disparaged the "writhings and twinings" of the painting's subjects, describing them as "as close to the unpardonable limits as anything that has lately appealed to the public eye". This same writer disapproved of the dark skin tones of some of the figures, arguing that "the brown visage of the gives but a dingy image of the roses and lilies that, from time immemorial, have made the charm of British beauty". The correspondent for "<a href="The%20London%20Magazine">The London Magazine</a>" felt that although the painting was "in many respects worthy of admiration... [there] is a spirit, a boldness, and a startling effect", the work was poorly executed overall. Its depiction of women drew particular ire: "the expression of the faces is vapid; the features rather homely; the limbs, though not ill-drawn, have not that finish and play of the muscles, which alone give lightness and elasticity. They seem lifted up with difficulty, and ready to fall." The review upbraided Etty as an artist who had "advanced half way on his road to classic excellence; and there, when he should have proceeded with increased ardour and more careful exactness from being in view of his object, he has stopped short." Etty's fellow artist <a href="John%20Constable">John Constable</a> privately described the work as "a revel rout of Satyrs and lady bums as usual".
Other critics offered a more positive impression of the piece. "<a href="The%20Examiner%20%281808%E2%80%9386%29">The Examiner</a>" celebrated Etty's having "outdone his former self, and most of his contemporaries". A reviewer in "<a href="The%20Mirror%20of%20Literature%2C%20Amusement%2C%20and%20Instruction">The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction</a>" said that "few pictures have attracted or deserved more attention than this masterly production," describing the figures as "graceful and elegant". "<a href="The%20Athenaeum%20%28British%20magazine%29">The Athenaeum</a>" thought it "decidedly the most attractive picture in the whole Exhibition", noting that their review was delayed because in the opening week of the exhibition, "the crowds which continually stood in front of it rendered it quite impossible to get such a view of it as would enable us to do it justice". "<a href="Colburn%27s%20New%20Monthly%20Magazine">Colburn's New Monthly Magazine</a>" considered it "another instance of the rapid advances which this rising artist is making towards perfection." The most effusive praise was offered in poetic form by <a href="John%20Taylor%20%28English%20publisher%29">John Taylor</a>, who in September 1828 imagined that if Milton and Nicolas Poussin were both alive to see the painting, Milton would view it with "proud delight", while Poussin would suffer an "envious thorn" with the realization that Etty's abilities had surpassed his own.

"The World Before the Flood" was bought at its 1828 exhibition by <a href="George%20Leveson-Gower%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Sutherland">The Marquess of Stafford</a> for 500 <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a> (about £ in 2019 terms), to add to his collection of nudes by Titian. Etty was delighted with his success at the exhibition, at which all three of the paintings he had exhibited were successfully sold to prestigious buyers.

From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks from the press on his supposed indecency and tastelessness, Etty often made a conscious effort to project a moral dimension into his work, although he continued to be a prominent painter of nudes. He died in 1849, working and exhibiting up until his death despite consistently being regarded by many as a pornographer. <a href="Charles%20Robert%20Leslie">Charles Robert Leslie</a> observed shortly after Etty's death that himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds". Interest in his work declined as <a href="Victorian%20painting">new movements</a> came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices.

"The World Before the Flood" was sold to F. E. Sidney in 1908 for 230 guineas (about £ in 2019 terms), and sold on to the <a href="Southampton%20City%20Art%20Gallery">Southampton City Art Gallery</a> in 1937 for 195 guineas (about £ in 2019 terms), where it remains. After its initial exhibition in 1828, the painting was shown at a number of significant exhibitions throughout the 19th century. Etty's preliminary oil sketch entered the collection of Etty's former mentor <a href="Thomas%20Lawrence">Sir Thomas Lawrence</a>. Following Lawrence's death in 1830, it was sold as "A Bacchanalian Scene" for 27 guineas (about £ in 2019 terms), and sold on as "Landscape with Figures" in 1908. In 1953 it was identified as a study for "The World Before the Flood", and purchased by the <a href="York%20Art%20Gallery">York Art Gallery</a>, where it remains. Both versions of the painting were shown together as part of a major retrospective of Etty's work at the York Art Gallery in 2011–12.

The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished

The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished is a large <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> on canvas by English artist <a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a>, first exhibited in 1825 and now in the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Scotland">National Gallery of Scotland</a>. Inspired by the <a href="Elgin%20Marbles">Elgin Marbles</a> and intended by the artist to provide a moral lesson on "the beauty of mercy", it shows a near-nude warrior whose sword has broken, forced to his knees in front of another near-nude soldier who prepares to inflict a killing blow. A woman, also near-nude, clutches the victorious warrior to beg him for mercy. Very unusually for a <a href="history%20painting">history painting</a> of the period, "The Combat" does not depict a scene from history, literature or religion and is not based on an existing artwork, but is instead a scene from the artist's own imagination.

When it was shown at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20Summer%20Exhibition">Royal Academy Summer Exhibition</a> of 1825, it attracted near-universal praise from critics for its technical excellence, its fusion of the styles of different schools of painting, and its subject matter. Nevertheless, it failed to find a buyer at the Summer Exhibition, and was instead bought by fellow artist <a href="John%20Martin%20%28painter%29">John Martin</a>. The painting proved too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold it on to the <a href="Royal%20Scottish%20Academy">Royal Scottish Academy</a>. It was transferred in 1910 to the National Gallery of Scotland, where it remains.

<a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a> was born in 1787, the son of a <a href="York">York</a> baker and miller. He began as an apprentice printer in <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>. On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved at the age of 18 to London "with a few pieces of chalk crayons", with the intention of becoming a <a href="history%20painting">history painter</a> in the tradition of the <a href="Old%20Masters">Old Masters</a>. Strongly influenced by the works of <a href="Titian">Titian</a> and <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Rubens</a>, he submitted paintings to the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts">Royal Academy of Arts</a> and the <a href="British%20Institution">British Institution</a>, all of which were either rejected or received scant attention when exhibited.

In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works, "<a href="The%20Arrival%20of%20Cleopatra%20in%20Cilicia">The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia</a>" (also known as "The Triumph of Cleopatra"). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. Following the praise for "Cleopatra", Etty tried to replicate its success by painting <a href="Nude%20%28art%29">nude figures</a> in biblical, literary and mythological settings, most notably "<a href="Youth%20on%20the%20Prow%2C%20and%20Pleasure%20at%20the%20Helm">A Sketch from One of Gray's Odes (Youth on the Prow)</a>" in 1822, and the controversial "Pandora Crowned by the Seasons" in 1824. Etty had travelled extensively in Italy in 1823, and painted "Pandora" hastily on his return as a "testimonial of recent progress" he had made while studying paintings in Italian collections. Critical opinion of "Pandora" was highly divided, with some critics greatly praising it as a technical accomplishment, while others saw it as a rushed pastiche of Titian and Rubens. "Pandora Crowned by the Seasons" sold for 300 <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a> (about £ in 2019 terms), and secured Etty the position of Associate at the Royal Academy of Arts.
While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Suppression%20of%20Vice">Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice</a>. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and the reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received.

Etty was fascinated with <a href="Classical%20antiquity">classical</a> artworks such as those he had seen during his recent travels in Italy, and in particular with the <a href="Elgin%20Marbles">Elgin Marbles</a>, a set of major <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greek</a> sculptures taken to London in controversial circumstances in the early 19th century.

"The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished" is a large painting, 399 cm (13 ft 1 in) across. It depicts a defeated soldier, kneeling in front of another soldier. The defeated fighter strains to free himself from the grip of the victorious warrior, who stands, raising a sword. A kneeling woman clutches the waist of the victorious soldier, raising her face to him to beg him to spare his defeated foe. The defeated warrior has a stronger body, a face more in keeping with the conventions of attractiveness at the time, and a more sympathetic expression, while the victorious man is darker skinned and has an expression of blank fierceness. The vanquished soldier's sword has broken, and lies beside him on the ground.

Etty did not base "The Combat" on any single incident from history or literature, or on any existing artwork, but on his own imagination; this was a highly unusual step to take regarding history paintings, which generally depicted themes from literature or religion. He had been considering the topic as early as 1821, and his plans took shape following his visit to Italy. During this visit Etty had met <a href="Antonio%20Canova">Antonio Canova</a> and been very impressed by him; "The Combat" is clearly influenced by his work. As well as drawing inspiration from classical sculpture, he was also strongly influenced by the composition of <a href="Old%20Master">Old Master</a> works he had seen while in Italy. As with many of Etty's works, the models posed for him separately in his studio, rather than as a group.

Etty, writing in 1849, described the purpose of "The Combat" as "to paint a great moral on the heart [of] the beauty of mercy." Etty's 1958 biographer Dennis Farr points out similarities in the composition of "The Combat" and <a href="John%20Flaxman">John Flaxman</a>'s drawing "Heracles Killing a Man to whom a Woman Clings", but while Etty and Flaxman were contemporaries at the Royal Academy, it is not known if Etty was aware of this drawing.
In the initial <a href="oil%20study">oil study</a> for the defeated warrior (<a href="York%20Art%20Gallery">York Art Gallery</a>), Etty gave the character a more defiant appearance than seen in the finished version. In this preliminary sketch he is not on his knees, but thrusts his leg out to brace himself. He has an expression of defiance and determination, rather than the plea for mercy and posture of total defeat shown in the final work.

The completed "The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished" was exhibited at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20Summer%20Exhibition">Royal Academy Summer Exhibition</a> in 1825.

On its exhibition, "The Combat" was generally highly praised by critics for its technical excellence, its combination of the Venetian and English styles of painting, and as an indication that Etty was moving away from nudity and towards history painting. "<a href="The%20European%20Magazine%2C%20and%20London%20Review">The European Magazine, and London Review</a>" commented that "in colour this picture strongly reminds us of the great heroes of the Venetian school, while in learned intelligence of form, and energy of action, it greatly surpasses them", observing that "we should not have the least objection to seeing this picture placed in one of the very first galleries, by the side of Titian and <a href="Paolo%20Veronese">Paul Veronese</a>."
In similar vein, "<a href="The%20Lady%27s%20Magazine">The Lady's Magazine</a>" felt that "The Combat" "strongly demonstrates the progress of [Etty] to excellence", remarking that "never was a more calculated to display the action in which the power of conquest is so eminently and fearfully delineated" and that "we have little doubt that the works of Titian were, on their first appearance ... what this piece is now." The same correspondent did find some flaws in the overly pronounced muscles of the victor's thigh and the lack of definition of muscle in the legs of the defeated man, but felt that despite this "The Combat" was "one of the finest and most masterly works that ever graced the walls of the Royal Academy."

"<a href="The%20London%20Magazine">The London Magazine</a>" was similarly effusive about the painting, admiring Etty's ability to fuse his own imagination with themes derived from the Elgin Marbles and from the Venetian Old Masters, and commenting that "it is always gratifying to those who feel for the honour and independence of painting when, as in the present instance, an artist successfully relies on nature and the resources of his own mind for his subject, and on the appreciation of collegial minds for his mode of treating it." "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", a newspaper which had previously condemned Etty as "offensive and indecent", felt that "though defective in some respects" "The Combat" was "a masterly effort" that successfully fused "the florid beauties of the Venetian school" with the "sober dignity and power of the Roman school" and that compared with his previous paintings, which were "too uniformly feeble in character and meretricious in effect to entitle them to any very decided praise", the painting proved Etty "capable of maintaining a much higher station in art than we had been led to expect."

An anonymous reviewer in the first issue of the short-lived "The Parthenon" magazine admired "The Combat" greatly, in particular the right foot of the female figure:
The foot in question was not universally admired by critics; the anonymous correspondent for "The London Magazine", who was otherwise effusive in his praise for "The Combat", felt that said foot "looks too much as if painted from a modern foot accustomed to compression in a shoe, for the heroic character and classical air of the rest of the work" and that her leg appeared too short.
The painting is the subject of one of <a href="Letitia%20Elizabeth%20Landon">Letitia Elizabeth Landon</a>'s Poetical Sketches of Modern Pictures in her 1826 collection, The Troubadour.

Failing to sell at the Summer Exhibition, "The Combat" was bought from Etty by fellow artist <a href="John%20Martin%20%28painter%29">John Martin</a> for 300 guineas (about £ in 2019 terms), following a promise Martin had made to Etty before the painting was complete. The painting was too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold it on to the <a href="Royal%20Scottish%20Academy">Royal Scottish Academy</a>. It was transferred in 1910 to the nearby <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Scotland">National Gallery of Scotland</a> where it remains. One of Etty's major works, it was exhibited at numerous major exhibitions including the seminal <a href="Art%20Treasures%20Exhibition%2C%20Manchester%201857">Art Treasures Exhibition</a> of 1857, before Etty fell out of fashion in the second half of the 19th century.
Throughout his life, "The Combat" continued to be considered one of Etty's most powerful paintings. In 1845, Etty took a smaller copy of "The Combat", which had been painted by an unknown Edinburgh artist, and completely reworked it to serve as the basis for an <a href="engraving">engraving</a> by <a href="George%20Thomas%20Doo">George Thomas Doo</a>. The engraving was published three years later, and the painting used as its model passed through the hands of several collectors in subsequent years, before entering the collection of the <a href="Ringling%20Museum">Ringling Museum</a> in 1934. A number of sketches attributed to Etty, under the name of "A Study for Mercy Interceding for the Vanquished", are also in circulation.

After the success of "The Combat", Etty continued with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including "Cleopatra", "Pandora" and "The Combat") all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts%23Membership">Royal Academician</a> in 1828, at that time the most prestigious honour available to an artist. "The Combat" was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. As time went by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.

The 1832 exhibition of "<a href="Youth%20on%20the%20Prow%2C%20and%20Pleasure%20at%20the%20Helm">Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm</a>", a painting containing apparently gratuitous nude figures, met a hostile reception from critics. From then on, while Etty continued to paint nude figures for the rest of his career, he made a conscious effort to try to illustrate moral lessons with his work. This effort was not wholly successful, and he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some throughout his career. He died in late 1849, and following his death nude paintings went rapidly out of fashion in Britain.

Perijá tapaculo

The Perijá tapaculo ("Scytalopus perijanus") is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird in the <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Tapaculo">Rhinocryptidae</a> (tapaculos). <a href="Endemism">Endemic</a> to the <a href="Serran%C3%ADa%20del%20Perij%C3%A1">Serranía del Perijá</a> mountain range on the <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>–<a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> border, the Perijá tapaculo is found at altitudes of . It measures , and its tail is around long. Specimens have long been stored in museums, but the species was only <a href="species%20description">described</a> in 2015 based on sixteen specimens found between July 2008 and February 2009. It is considered vulnerable.

Adults have neutral grey heads, brown necks, brown-<a href="sepia%20%28color%29">sepia</a> striped backs, and grey-white bellies, breasts, and throats. Males have some <a href="buff%20%28colour%29">buff</a> markings on their breasts, and less sharp brown spots on their napes than females. The Perijá tapaculo is a secretive bird and therefore difficult to observe; as a result its ecology is poorly known. It feeds on insects and reproduces between April and July. Its range is partially within <a href="Chamicero%20de%20Perij%C3%A1%20Bird%20Reserve">Chamicero de Perijá Bird Reserve</a> in Colombia and the <a href="Sierra%20de%20Perij%C3%A1%20National%20Park">Sierra de Perijá National Park</a> in Venezuela.

<a href="Tapaculo">Tapaculo</a>s are the most primitive family of <a href="Tyranni">suboscines</a>, divided into 12 genera containing 60 species. "Scytalopus", the genus to which the Perijá tapaculo belongs, has an abundance of similar species, many of which are difficult to classify through appearance. Some individual species from other genera are like "Scytalopus" in size and plumage, but have different behaviour and <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> features. Vocal studies and <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> analysis are often used to differentiate between species within the genus; a number of visually identical species previously classified as <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the <a href="Magellanic%20tapaculo">Magellanic tapaculo</a> ("S. magellanicus") have been identified through these methods, and the majority of subspecies within the genus have subsequently been reclassified as separate species.

Between 1941 and 1942, American <a href="ornithology">ornithologist</a> <a href="Melbourne%20Armstrong%20Carriker">Melbourne Armstrong Carriker</a> collected 27 specimens of the Perijá tapaculo in six locations on the western side of the <a href="Serran%C3%ADa%20del%20Perij%C3%A1">Serranía del Perijá</a>. He identified them as specimens of the <a href="northern%20white-crowned%20tapaculo">northern white-crowned tapaculo</a> ("S. atratus"), despite size and colour differences, and sent them to the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">National Museum of Natural History</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> In 1953, the specimens began to attract the attention of biologists, and were successively identified as the <a href="brown-rumped%20tapaculo">brown-rumped tapaculo</a> ("S. latebricola"), the <a href="Caracas%20tapaculo">Caracas tapaculo</a> ("S. caracae"), and the <a href="M%C3%A9rida%20tapaculo">Mérida tapaculo</a> ("S. meridanus"). Some further believed that the specimens could belong to an undescribed species, or constitute a subspecies of the <a href="pale-bellied%20tapaculo">pale-bellied tapaculo</a> ("S. griseicollis") or the Mérida tapaculo based on morphological studies, but they were never classified as any of these.

In September 2006, biologists <a href="Juan%20Pablo%20L%C3%B3pez%20%28biologist%29">Juan Pablo López</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Cort%C3%A9s%20Diago">Alexander Cortés Diago</a> found two specimens in a <a href="cloud%20forest">cloud forest</a> at an altitude of on the western side of the Serranía del Perijá in Colombia, but the information collected was insufficient to identify a new species. Between July 2008 and February 2009, sixteen new specimens were collected in an area previously explored by Carriker. New vocal, morphological, genetic, and ecological studies of these specimens confirmed that they constituted a new species, "Scytalopus perijanus", first <a href="species%20description">described</a> by <a href="Jorge%20Enrique%20Avenda%C3%B1o">Jorge Enrique Avendaño</a> et al. on 11 March 2015 following a three-year expedition, and accepted by the <a href="American%20Ornithologists%27%20Union%23Committees">South American Classification Committee</a>. The Latin word "perijanus" refers to the Serranía del Perijá mountain range, and the genus name "Scytalopus" comes from the Greek "skutale" (stick) and "pous" (foot).

The <a href="Type%20%28biology%29">type specimen</a> of the Perijá tapaculo, an adult male, was found in the Serranía del Perijá near the El Cinco <a href="vereda">vereda</a> of <a href="Manaure%2C%20Cesar">Manaure</a>, <a href="Cesar%20Department">Cesar Department</a>, Colombia, at an altitude of . Jorge Enrique Avendaño lured the specimen by playing a recording of its song on 10 July 2008 at the edge of a <a href="Montane%20ecology%23Montane%20forests">montane forest</a>. Sequence analysis of the mitochondrial gene <a href="MT-ND2">ND2</a> from the Perijá tapaculo showed that its nearest relatives are the brown-rumped tapaculo, Caracas tapaculo, and Mérida tapaculo.

The Perijá tapaculo is a small bird, in length with an average mass of 17 to 18 grams (around 0.6 oz). The bill averages long, wide, and high. The legs are about long. The Perijá tapaculo's <a href="tarsometatarsus">tarsus</a> averages long. The wings measure on average and the tail is about long with between 8 and 12 <a href="Flight%20feather%23Rectrices">rectrices</a>.

The forehead, <a href="Lore%20%28anatomy%29">lores</a>, crown, mantle, and <a href="scapula">scapula</a>r area are a neutral grey colour. There is a brown spot on the nape. The top of the tail is brown, and the bottom is faintly striped brown. The bird's back and rump are striped brown-<a href="Sepia%20%28color%29">sepia</a>, and the throat, breast, and belly are grey-white. Its lower belly and flanks are <a href="Tawny%20%28color%29">tawny</a>. The <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> is dark brown. Male specimens are distinguished by having less sharp brown spots on their napes, and the bottom of their breasts are mixed with a pale <a href="Buff%20%28colour%29">buff</a> colour. The legs are brown on the back and whitish on the front. Young birds have a yellowish appearance with striped brown flanks.

The bird's plumage colouration is most similar to the pale-bellied tapaculo. The "S. g. morenoi" subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo can be differentiated from the Perijá tapaculo by its entirely brown back and nape, and its different calls. Juveniles of this subspecies have a dull <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Dorsal%20and%20ventral">ventral</a> plumage, while the Perijá tapaculo has a more yellow plumage. It also resembles the Caracas tapaculo but has a duller ventral colour.

Like other species in genus "<a href="Scytalopus">Scytalopus</a>", the Perijá tapaculo is secretive and therefore difficult to observe. The call and song differ from those of most other species in the genus, and the latter is composed of two short "churr"s repeating up to 65 times at 0.5 to 3 second intervals. The diet of the species is little known, but studies of the stomach contents of seven specimens suggested that they fed exclusively on insects.

Little is known about the reproduction of the species, but it is believed to nest between April and July. The species builds its <a href="wikt%3Aglobular">globular</a> nests in underground cavities about in diameter and around in height, lined with mosses, grasses, and plant roots around a central space about wide. The nests are accessed by a short tunnel with a depth of and a diameter of . Young birds may leave the nest at the end of June. Like those of other "Scytalopus" species, male specimens have demonstrated involvement in parenting.

The Perijá tapaculo is <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to the Serranía del Perijá, a mountain range on the Colombia–Venezuela border known for its high rates of endemism. It has been observed in nineteen localities on both sides of the border between altitudes of above sea level; in its northern range, there are no suitable forests below . The bird has been observed at on the Venezuelan side, and at 1,6003,225 m on the Colombian side.

The Perijá tapaculo lives in and on the edges of humid <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>s, as well as in <a href="elfin%20forest">elfin forest</a>s and amongst woody "<a href="p%C3%A1ramo">páramo</a>" shrubs in high-mountain grassland areas, especially at altitudes of . Some specimens have been observed feeding in dense thickets within of the ground, often near the forest. Others have been observed running through open grassy areas between bushes.

The species has not been identified as being <a href="sympatric">sympatric</a> with any other species of the genus "Scytalopus". However, there is a possibility that its range overlaps with that of the "S. atratus nigricans", which occupies a different micro-habitat on the eastern side of the Serranía del Perijá at altitudes of ; or that it may be found within the range of the <a href="pale-bellied%20tapaculo">pale-bellied tapaculo</a> in the lower reaches of the <a href="Serran%C3%ADa%20de%20Los%20Motilones">Serranía de Los Motilones</a> mountain range, south of the Serranía del Perijá.

Jorge Enrique Avendaño et al. wrote in the original description of the Perijá tapaculo that the size and quality of the species' range are being reduced, although it can tolerate a certain level of <a href="Disjunct%20distribution">fragmentation</a> of its range. Its natural habitat covers about . The description entails the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) classification of this species as <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a>. The authors believe that to protect the Perijá tapaculo, conservation measures on the Colombian side of the border should reflect those on the Venezuelan side, as the forests of the Serranía del Perijá have been largely destroyed on the Colombian side by <a href="logging">logging</a> activities and forest clearance for agriculture.

On 28 January 2014, prior to the formal description of the bird, the <a href="Chamicero%20de%20Perij%C3%A1%20Bird%20Reserve">Chamicero de Perijá Bird Reserve</a> was created by <a href="Fundaci%C3%B3n%20ProAves">Fundación ProAves</a> to maintain one of Colombia's most fragile habitats. In addition to the Perijá tapaculo, several other Perijá-endemic endangered species, such as the <a href="Perij%C3%A1%20metaltail">Perijá metaltail</a> ("Metallura iracunda") and <a href="Perij%C3%A1%20thistletail">Perijá thistletail</a> ("Asthenes perijana") are protected within this reserve's . The Colombian section of the Serranía del Perijá is dangerous for scientific excursions due to the presence of the <a href="FARC">FARC</a> <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla group</a> in the region. In Venezuela, the <a href="Sierra%20de%20Perij%C3%A1%20National%20Park">Sierra de Perijá National Park</a> covers and partially protects the habitat of the Perijá tapaculo.

Hogwarts Express (Universal Orlando Resort)

The Hogwarts Express is an <a href="broad%20gauge">broad gauge</a> <a href="funicular">funicular</a> railway, <a href="people%20mover">people mover</a>, and attraction within the <a href="Universal%20Orlando%20Resort">Universal Orlando Resort</a> in <a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando, Florida</a>, United States.
The route runs between Hogsmeade station in the <a href="Universal%27s%20Islands%20of%20Adventure">Islands of Adventure</a> theme park and King's Cross station in the London area of the <a href="Universal%20Studios%20Florida">Universal Studios Florida</a> theme park. It provides a connection between the <a href="The%20Wizarding%20World%20of%20Harry%20Potter%20%28Universal%20Orlando%20Resort%29%23Diagon%20Alley">Diagon Alley</a> and <a href="The%20Wizarding%20World%20of%20Harry%20Potter%20%28Universal%20Orlando%20Resort%29%23Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a> areas which, together, form the Harry Potter-themed Wizarding World area, based on the <a href="Harry%20Potter%20%28film%20series%29">"Harry Potter" film series</a>.

The system, which was manufactured by the <a href="Doppelmayr%20Garaventa%20Group">Doppelmayr Garaventa Group</a>, is operated with two replicas of the Hogwarts Express. The two directions of travel show two different videos. Because the trains transport guests between stations in two separate theme parks, riders must have an admission pass valid for both theme parks, with <a href="ticket%20inspector">ticket inspector</a>s checking prior to boarding.

The Hogwarts Express <a href="Soft%20launch">soft-opened</a> to the public on July 1, 2014, before officially opening seven days later along with the rest of the . The service was immediately popular and within one month of opening, one million journeys had been made.

The idea of creating a Hogwarts Express-related element came from Mark Woodbury, the president of Universal Creative. After the opening of the Hogsmeade attraction at the Islands of Adventure theme park in 2010, Universal began considering how to keep attendance balanced between the adjacent parks. At first, the creative team considered putting Diagon Alley within Islands of Adventure. Eventually they decided that the London and Hogsmeade environments should not be visible from each other. As a result, Woodbury proposed building Diagon Alley in Universal Studios Florida and then connecting the two Harry Potter-themed lands. Several means of transport were proposed for the connector before planners settled on the idea of the Hogwarts Express train.

In early 2011, <a href="construction%20surveying">construction surveying</a> was spotted in the <a href="Universal%27s%20Islands%20of%20Adventure%23The%20Lost%20Continent">Lost Continent section of Islands of Adventure</a>, and the resort had begun surveying visitors about a possible expansion. This led to rumors that Universal Orlando was planning to expand The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. At the end of the year, the resort announced the <a href="Jaws%20%28ride%29">Jaws: The Ride</a> would close on January 2, 2012, to make way for a future development. Almost two and a half years later, <a href="WESH">WESH</a>-TV, the local <a href="National%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">NBC</a> affiliate for the Orlando/Central Florida area, reported that an elevated track system had been installed at Universal Orlando and that the track ran between Hogsmeade in Islands of Adventure and a construction area in Universal Studios Florida.

In May 2013, Universal Orlando announced the expansion of Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Diagon Alley, along with the Hogwarts Express train, to be located on the former site of the Jaws attraction. By the end of August 2013, all six passenger cars and both <a href="Tender%20%28rail%29">tenders</a> were ready to be assembled on the track. The first of the two trains was installed on the track on October 24, 2013. The second train was placed on the track in early December 2013. On December 2, 2013, "Orlando Attractions Magazine", an amusement park website, spotted one of the trains being tested.

The resort previewed the interior of the Hogwarts Express in January 2014 through a <a href="Lifecasting%20%28video%20stream%29">live cast</a>. In mid-March 2014, Universal Orlando Resort released further information about the ride, including concept animations. The resort announced in June 2014 that the Diagon Alley expansion, including the Hogwarts Express, would officially open to the public on July 8, 2014. A week later, Universal Orlando soft-opened the Hogwarts Express, without any announcement. Within a month of the Hogwarts Express' opening, one million riders had ridden the Hogwarts Express. It had taken approximately two and a half years to develop by a team of 150 people.

It is only possible to ride the Hogwarts Express after having already entered either theme park and presenting a ticket that allows admission to both of them on the same day. The train carries 30,000 passengers per day, and operates 365 days per year.

The track of the Hogwarts Express is a single-track funicular <a href="elevated%20railway">elevated railway</a> running over the <a href="backlot">backlot</a> between the two theme parks, with a two-track passing loop at the midpoint. It is long and has a track gauge of . On the track, there is a haul rope and a counter rope, each with a diameter of . The cable winding motor is at King's Cross station and has a <a href="rated%20capacity">rated load</a> of and a peak <a href="power%20rating">power rating</a> of .

The Hogwarts Express uses two trains that can transport 168 passengers each, giving a total of 336 passengers per cycle. Each train is an articulated <a href="cable%20car%20%28railway%29">cable car</a> formed of five sections: a replica of a steam locomotive and its tender plus a set of three passenger coaches each with seven passenger compartments. Each compartment holds up to eight seated passengers and has its own projection system instead of windows. Originally each train was planned to have two passenger coaches; the number was increased following a survey that suggested potential passengers saw the Hogwarts Express as an attraction rather than a means of transportation between the parks. The locomotive on the trains weigh , the tenders weigh , and each passenger carriage weighs . Because of the funicular track system, both trains depart and arrive at the end stations at the same time and travel at the same speed of . The two trains pass each other at the halfway point.

On both trains, the locomotive faces towards Hogsmeade station; it is not possible for the trains to face King's Cross. As a result, the Hogwarts Express departs from Hogsmeade and enters King's Cross in reverse. At each station, the platforms are located on the left side of the trains. The trains are therefore only designed to be seen from one side; the other lacks the locomotives' false <a href="driving%20wheel">driving wheel</a>s and specific detailing. Over 70 percent of the cabling in the trains are for the show effects and physically animated components.

The trains were built in <a href="Goldau">Goldau</a>, Switzerland. <a href="Doppelmayr%20Garaventa%20Group%23CWA%20Constructions">CWA Constructions</a> designed both the exterior and interior of the trains to make them look as similar as possible to the Hogwarts Express seen in the Harry Potter film franchise. They are based on the <a href="steam%20locomotive">steam locomotive</a> <a href="GWR%204900%20Class%205972%20Olton%20Hall">GWR "Hall" class 5972 "Olton Hall"</a> (as 5972 "Hogwarts Castle") and were built from aluminum and glass-reinforced plastics. Afterwards, an artificial <a href="Rail%20transport%20modelling%23Weathering">weathering</a> process was applied to give the appearance of a historic train.

Frey AG was responsible for wiring the trains for the video and sound components. The company also installed other technical equipment that allows the trains to be controlled by a computer system.

Each compartment has a curved screen where the window would be. There are two different videos, depending on the destination of the train. The special effects in both videos were by <a href="Double%20Negative%20%28VFX%29">Double Negative</a>.

The <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a> recorded the music played throughout the journey at <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">Abbey Road Studios</a> on March 25, 2014. The music for the northbound journey is called "Connector Train – Hogsmeade to London".

Theme park guests may use the Hogwarts Express to travel between Hogsmeade and King's Cross in London, close to Diagon Alley. They can travel in either direction as long as the guest has purchased a Park-to-Park ticket, Annual Pass, or Seasonal Pass, which gives guests access to both of Universal Orlando's theme parks within the same day. Two different videos are provided depending on the destination of the train, both of which are approximately four minutes long.

The King's Cross station is built on a site that previously held the Jaws attraction. The entrance to the station, which is a quarter-scale replica of <a href="London%20King%27s%20Cross%20railway%20station">London King's Cross railway station</a>, is located in the London area, close to Diagon Alley. Passengers enter the station building and have their admission ticket checked. They then enter a queue which takes them farther into the station building, under a <a href="split-flap%20display">split-flap departure board</a>, and past London-related advertisements, several stacks of suitcases and a shop selling British brands of food and drink. After ascending a flight of stairs, passengers find themselves between signs for King's Cross Platform 9 and Platform 10. They can see those ahead of them walking through the "wall" forming the entrance to Platform . This effect uses the <a href="Pepper%27s%20ghost">Pepper's ghost</a> illusion. After continuing around several corners, guests arrive on Platform to wait for the next train. After the Hogwarts Express has reversed into Platform and the arriving passengers have disembarked, the next passengers enter one of the twenty-one compartments in the three passenger coaches.

As the train departs King's Cross, the video sequence in the compartments starts with <a href="Magical%20creatures%20in%20Harry%20Potter%23Hedwig">Hedwig the owl</a> flying alongside while passing through the outskirts of London. Hedwig flies away and <a href="Magical%20creatures%20in%20Harry%20Potter%23Dementors">Dementors</a> arrive from over the nearby buildings. At the same time <a href="Harry%20Potter%20%28character%29">Harry Potter</a>, <a href="Ron%20Weasley">Ron Weasley</a>, and <a href="Hermione%20Granger">Hermione Granger</a> pass along the corridor side of the coach looking for food. The journey enters a tunnel; upon its exit, it passes by Malfoy Manor during a stormy night. Next, the train passes through a second tunnel and the lights in the compartments go out as a Dementor enters the train and passes along the corridor; Harry Potter uses his magic to defeat the Dementor. After exiting the tunnel, riders are greeted by <a href="Rubeus%20Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a> flying on a motorbike with <a href="Hogwarts">Hogwarts</a> in the background. As the train enters a forest, the flying <a href="Ford%20Anglia">Ford Anglia</a> appears and starts driving through the terrain. The car crashes soon after and the train leaves the forest, passing by Hogwarts once again before arriving at Hogsmeade Station with Hagrid greeting passengers.

Passengers then disembark from the train, walk down a ramp past the front of the Hogwarts Express and follow a path leading to Hogsmeade.

At the entrance of the queue, ticket inspectors check passengers' tickets for Universal Studios. The line then leads into a forested area which leads into the Hogsmeade station building. Upon climbing a flight of steps, travelers reach the Hogsmeade station platform. Once the arriving passengers on the Hogwarts Express have left the platform, passengers waiting may then board the train and enter one of the twenty-one passenger compartments within the train.

As the train departs towards King's Cross, the video sequence in the compartments begins with Hagrid waving goodbye outside of the window. Shadows of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger can also been seen walking down the train corridor, looking for an empty compartment. Following this, <a href="Hippogriff">Buckbeak</a> flies outside the window, while Hogwarts can be seen in the background. Shortly after, the train enters a forest where <a href="centaur">centaur</a>s are running. Upon exiting the forest, Hogwarts can be seen once again in the background. <a href="Fred%20and%20George%20Weasley">Fred and George Weasley</a> appear, flying broomsticks and playing with fireworks. The Hogwarts Express then enters a tunnel, after which riders find themselves in the middle of a storm and pass <a href="Malfoy%20Manor">Malfoy Manor</a>. The journey then enters a second tunnel; Harry, Ron, and Hermione appear again in the train corridor. As a spider crawls up the compartment door, Ron eats it and the trio continue to walk on down the corridor. After the tunnel the journey continues into <a href="London">London</a> passing by an industrial factory and then a residential area. The <a href="Magical%20objects%20in%20Harry%20Potter%23Transportation">Knight Bus</a> then appears; squeezing between buildings and shrinking to pass under a bridge. As the bus drives away, the train enters King's Cross station, where <a href="Alastor%20Moody">Alastor Moody</a> greets passengers.

Passengers then disembark onto Platform of King's Cross and proceed down some stairs into a 2010-era King's Cross station, before arriving at the London waterfront area, adjacent to Diagon Alley.

Robert Niles from "Theme Park Insider" mentioned how the attraction "broke walls". Examples included the separation of the Wizarding and <a href="Muggle">Muggle</a> worlds; how Universal made the audience the performers (in the part of the King's Cross queue where guests walk through the wall leading to Platform ). He wrote: "It's become convention for theme park attractions to drop you off at or very near the same point where you boarded the ride, so it's a bit disorienting when you exit the Hogwarts Express and find that you're not only in a different train station — you're in a different theme park."

Arthur Levine from "<a href="About.com">About.com</a>" was disappointed that Universal had not tried to re-create the magical aspect of guests entering Platform : "When it's time to make their own way to the platform, however, it appears to would-be wizards that they are merely entering a darkened corridor. Aside from an audible "whoosh" sound, there is, regrettably, no attempt to reproduce the magical, molecule-shifting phenomenon." He also found it awkward that the Hogwarts Express reverses into Platform at King's Cross—although in Hogsmeade the train arrives facing forwards. Overall Levine said that the attraction does more than just making it a ride: "By making it an integral and compelling part of The Wizarding World, most guests would want to ride it to get the complete Potter experience. By making it an inter-park ride and requiring a two-park ticket to board it, Universal will surely help <a href="upselling">up-sell</a> a lot more customers to higher-priced passes, encourage multi-day visits, increase demand for its on-property hotels, and drive business at its CityWalk dining/shopping/entertainment district".

In 2014, attendance at Universal Studios Florida increased to 8.3 million visitors, compared to 7.1 million in the previous year. Attendance at Islands of Adventure did not change. According to vice president of <a href="AECOM">AECOM</a>'s economics, Brian Sands, the attendance increase at the Studios was likely due to the Diagon Alley expansion. Sands also mentioned attendance at Islands of Adventure remained the same since "visitors go to the new thing", though the Hogwarts Express likely prevented attendance from decreasing at the park.

RAAF area commands

Area commands were the major operational and administrative formations of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) between 1940 and 1954. Established in response to the outbreak of World War II, they underpinned the Air Force's geographically based command-and-control system for the duration of the conflict and into the early years of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, until being superseded by a functional control system made up of <a href="RAAF%20Home%20Command">Home</a>, <a href="RAAF%20Training%20Command">Training</a>, and <a href="RAAF%20Maintenance%20Command">Maintenance Commands</a>.

The area commands and their responsibilities evolved over time according to changing circumstances. The RAAF established four commands to begin with in 1940–41: <a href="Southern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Southern Area</a>, <a href="Central%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Central Area</a>, <a href="Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Western Area</a>, and <a href="Northern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Northern Area</a>. They oversaw most of the operations, training and maintenance within their boundaries. A concession to functional control occurred in mid-1941, when the Air Force formed two <a href="Group%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">groups</a> that assumed the training role of the southern and eastern states; Central Area was disbanded and most of its units taken over by Northern and Southern Areas, and the newly formed <a href="No.%202%20Training%20Group%20RAAF">No. 2 (Training) Group</a>. The area structure was further revised in 1942, following the outbreak of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>; Northern Area was split into <a href="North-Eastern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Eastern Area</a> and <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western Area</a>, and a new command, <a href="Eastern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Eastern Area</a>, was created, making a total of five commands. The same year, the RAAF formed two functional groups that assumed the maintenance role of the area commands; the latter focussed on operations until the end of hostilities. A new area command covering RAAF units in New Guinea, <a href="Northern%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Northern Command</a>, was formed in 1944 and dissolved soon after the war.

By the early 1950s, most operational units were based within Eastern Area Command, most Air Force training was controlled by Southern Area Command, and maintenance was the responsibility of <a href="Maintenance%20Group%20RAAF">Maintenance Group</a>. The area command structure was no longer considered appropriate for delivering the concentration of force necessary for combat, and the Federal government decided to replace it with a functional command-and-control system. In 1953, Eastern Area Command was re-formed as Home Command (controlling operations), Southern Area Command was re-formed as Training Command, and Maintenance Group was re-designated Maintenance Command. The three remaining area commands ceded their authority to the functional commands in 1954, and were disbanded by the end of 1956.

On the eve of World War II, the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) comprised twelve flying <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadrons</a>, two aircraft depots and a flying school, situated at five air bases: <a href="RAAF%20Point%20Cook">Point Cook</a> and <a href="RAAF%20Laverton">Laverton</a> in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>; <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">Richmond</a> and <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Rathmines">Rathmines</a> in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>; and <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Pearce">Pearce</a> in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>. An air force of this size did not require large-scale operational formations such as <a href="Wing%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">wings</a>, <a href="Group%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">groups</a>, or <a href="Command%20%28military%20formation%29">commands</a>, as all units could be directly administered and controlled by RAAF Headquarters in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. With the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">onset of war</a> in September 1939, the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Australian Air Board</a> decided to implement a decentralised form of command and control, commensurate with an envisioned increase in manpower and units. The RAAF's initial move in this direction was to create Nos. 1 and 2 Groups in November 1939, the former based in Melbourne to control units in Victoria, and the latter in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> to control units in New South Wales.

In January 1940, the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Vice-Marshal <a href="Stanley%20Goble">Jimmy Goble</a>, proposed organising the RAAF along functional lines with Home Defence, Training, and Maintenance Commands, but the Federal government did not take up this plan. Goble was replaced in February by a <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) officer, Air Chief Marshal <a href="Charles%20Burnett%20%28RAF%20officer%29">Sir Charles Burnett</a>, who focussed on rapid expansion of the RAAF to meet the needs of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a> and believed that Australia's huge land mass would make a functional command system unwieldy. He proceeded to reorganise the Air Force into a geographically based "area" system. The roles of each area command were the same: <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">air defence</a>, protection of adjacent <a href="sea%20lane">sea lane</a>s, and <a href="aerial%20reconnaissance">aerial reconnaissance</a>. Each area was led by an <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) who was responsible for the administration and operations of all bases and units within his boundary. Exceptions to this policy included aircraft depots and the <a href="Central%20Flying%20School%20RAAF">Central Flying School</a> that trained flying instructors, as their range of responsibilities crossed area boundaries and therefore came under the direct control of RAAF Headquarters. The static area system was primarily defensive in nature, but considered well-suited to training new pilots, who could be instructed at flying schools and mentored through their initial squadron postings, all within the same geographical region.

The RAAF planned four area commands initially: <a href="Southern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Southern Area</a>, covering all units in Victoria, <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> and the southern <a href="Riverina">Riverina</a> district of New South Wales; <a href="Central%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Central Area</a>, covering units in New South Wales except southern Riverina and the north of the state; <a href="Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Western Area</a>, covering units in Western Australia; and <a href="Northern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Northern Area</a>, covering units in northern New South Wales, <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> and <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua">Papua</a>. The first two commands established, in March 1940, were Southern Area, which essentially took over the role and headquarters of No. 1 Group in Melbourne, and Central Area, which evolved from No. 2 Group in Sydney. Western and Northern Areas eventually followed in January and May 1941, respectively; pending their formation, units in Queensland were temporarily controlled by Central Area Command, and those in Western Australia, Northern Territory and Papua came under the direct control of RAAF Headquarters.

By mid-1941, RAAF Headquarters had determined to form training units in the southern and eastern states into semi-geographical, semi-functional groups separate to the area commands. This led to the establishment in August of <a href="No.%201%20Training%20Group%20RAAF">No. 1 (Training) Group</a> in Melbourne, covering Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia, and <a href="No.%202%20Training%20Group%20RAAF">No. 2 (Training) Group</a> in Sydney, covering New South Wales and Queensland. Central Area was then disbanded and its responsibilities "divided as convenient", according to the <a href="Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201939%E2%80%931945">official history of the war</a>, between Southern Area, Northern Area, and No. 2 (Training) Group. Western Area retained responsibility for training, as well as operations and maintenance, within its boundaries.

With the outbreak of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> in December 1941, Northern Area was split the following month into <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western</a> and <a href="North-Eastern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Eastern Areas</a>, to counter distinct Japanese threats to Northern Australia and New Guinea, respectively. Southern Area was also considered appropriate for subdivision owing to its size, so <a href="Eastern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Eastern Area</a> was established in May 1942 to take over control of operational units in New South Wales and southern Queensland. These arrangements stabilised the number of area commands at five. Of necessity, the two northerly commands were primarily responsible for bombing and air defence, while the other commands focussed on maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare. Further convergence of command-and-control responsibilities along semi-geographical, semi-functional lines took place between June and September 1942, when authority over maintenance units was transferred from the area commands to the newly formed <a href="No.%204%20Group%20RAAF">No. 4 (Maintenance) Group</a> in Melbourne and <a href="No.%205%20Group%20RAAF">No. 5 (Maintenance) Group</a> in Sydney. Some finetuning of the area boundaries occurred in August: as well as the Northern Territory, North-Western Area was given responsibility for the portion of Western Australia north of a line drawn south-east from <a href="Yampi%20Sound">Yampi Sound</a> to the Northern Territory border, and part of Queensland adjacent to the <a href="Barkly%20Tableland">Barkly Tableland</a>.

Until 1942, RAAF Headquarters exercised complete operational and administrative control over the area commands. In April that year, Allied Air Forces (AAF) Headquarters was established under General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>'s <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">South West Pacific Area</a> (SWPA), with operational authority over all RAAF combat infrastructure, including the area commands. In September the new AAF commander, Major General <a href="George%20Kenney">George Kenney</a>, formed the majority of his US flying units into <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a>, and most of their Australian counterparts into <a href="RAAF%20Command">RAAF Command</a>, led by Air Vice-Marshal <a href="William%20Bostock">Bill Bostock</a>. Bostock exercised control of Australian air operations through the area commands, although RAAF Headquarters continued to hold overarching administrative authority, meaning that Bostock and his area commanders were ultimately dependent for supplies and equipment on the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice-Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, who had taken over from Burnett in May 1942.

To help overcome the static nature of the area command system, in September 1942 the RAAF created a large mobile formation known as <a href="No.%209%20Operational%20Group%20RAAF">No. 9 (Operational) Group</a>, a self-contained tactical air force that could keep pace with Allied advances north through New Guinea and towards Japan. By April 1944, No. 9 Group had become a garrison force in New Guinea and lost its mobile function to No. 10 (Operational) Group (later the <a href="Australian%20First%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">Australian First Tactical Air Force</a>). No. 9 Group was therefore re-formed as a dedicated area command covering air units in New Guinea; Bostock had recommended calling it Northern Area, before RAAF Headquarters settled on <a href="Northern%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Northern Command</a>. In August that year, RAAF Headquarters proposed disbanding the training and maintenance groups formed in 1941–42 and return their functions to the control of the area commands, but no action was taken. The same month, the Air Board recommended carving a new Central Area Command out of Eastern Area, which it considered too large to be controlled by one headquarters. This proposed Central Area would have been responsible for units in southern Queensland but the <a href="War%20Cabinet">War Cabinet</a> deferred its decision, as it had when a similar concept was raised in October 1943.

Near the end of the war, <a href="No.%2011%20Group%20RAAF">No. 11 Group</a> was formed on <a href="Morotai">Morotai</a> in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, using elements of Northern Command and the First Tactical Air Force; this freed the latter from garrison duties following the <a href="Borneo%20campaign%20%281945%29">liberation of Borneo</a>. In recommending the Morotai garrison's establishment, Bostock explained that while it shared the static characteristic of an area command, it differed in that the area commands were part of the permanent structure of the Air Force and situated within the borders of Australia's mainland and overseas territories, whereas the new formation was a temporary wartime measure, headquartered on foreign territory.

Following the end of the Pacific War in August 1945, SWPA was dissolved and the Air Board again assumed full control of all its operational formations. Nos. 1 and 2 (Training) Groups, and No. 5 (Maintenance) Group, were disbanded between January and March 1946. Northern Command, having been re-designated Northern Area in December 1945, was disbanded in February 1947. The other area commands continued to function with essentially the same boundaries as during the war, except that North-Western Area no longer covered the Dutch East Indies.

In the aftermath of the war, a geographically based command-and-control system was considered outmoded, and calls came to replace it with a system based on function. Bostock, who found the area boundaries "arbitrary", proposed a functional structure consisting of operational, maintenance, and training commands. With hindsight, the area commands were judged adequate for the organisation of the Air Force in the early years of World War II, but not for the rapid response times and concentration of force necessary to properly prepare for attacks on Australia following the start of the Pacific War, nor for conducting offensive operations from 1943 onwards. Air Marshal Jones, who had retained his position as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) following the war, resisted pressure to replace the area structure. He was persuaded by his staff to set up a conference to discuss the possibility of change, but participation by the CAS, who had been satisfied with the wartime system, and the area commanders themselves, whose positions were on the line, was half-hearted at best. Jones did suggest reducing the number of area commands to three (Northern Area to cover Queensland and the Northern Territory, Eastern Area to cover New South Wales, and Southern Area to encompass Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania) as part of a much larger proposal to restructure the post-war RAAF, but this never eventuated.

The Federal government retired Jones in February 1952 and replaced him with an RAF officer, Air Marshal <a href="Donald%20Hardman">Donald Hardman</a>, who was well versed in the functional command system employed in Britain. Hardman believed that restructuring the Air Force would remove inefficiencies and duplication, and permit commanders greater autonomy, allowing more effective concentration of strength in a potential combat situation. He declared that the RAAF was "the one force that could quickly strike for Australia's and the Commonwealth's defence in South East Asia". To this end he proposed reorganising command and control of the Air Force according to three major functions: operations, covering home defence and mobile task forces; training, including all permanent, reserve and <a href="national%20service">national service</a> recruitment and instruction; and maintenance, responsible for supply, equipment and other logistical services. The three functions were duly constituted in October 1953 as <a href="RAAF%20Home%20Command">Home</a>, <a href="RAAF%20Training%20Command">Training</a>, and <a href="RAAF%20Maintenance%20Command">Maintenance Commands</a>, respectively.
Home Command was formed from the existing Eastern Area Command, which was considered a "de facto" operational organisation owing to the preponderance of such forces within its boundaries. Training Command was formed from Southern Area Command, as it was already the hub of training services, controlling those in New South Wales and Queensland as well as Victoria and South Australia. Maintenance Command was formed from the extant Maintenance Group—as No. 4 (Maintenance) Group had been known since July 1947—headquartered in Melbourne. The transition to a functional system was completed in February 1954, when the three new commands assumed control of all operations, training and maintenance from Western, North-Western, and North-Eastern Area Commands. The headquarters of these three area commands remained in existence but only, according to the Melbourne "<a href="The%20Argus%20%28Melbourne%29">Argus</a>", as "remote control points" for Home Command. North-Western Area Command was disbanded in June 1955, Western Area Command in November 1956, and North-Eastern Area Command in December 1956.

The functional commands established in 1953–54 were revised in 1959. Home Command was renamed Operational Command, and Training and Maintenance Commands merged to become <a href="RAAF%20Support%20Command">Support Command</a>. Operational Command was renamed <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Air Command</a> in 1987, and three years later Support Command split into <a href="RAAF%20Logistics%20Command">Logistics Command</a> and Training Command. In 1997, logistics management became the responsibility of Support Command (Air Force), the RAAF component of the Defence-wide Support Command Australia (later subsumed by the <a href="Defence%20Materiel%20Organisation">Defence Materiel Organisation</a>). Training Command was re-formed as <a href="Air%20Force%20Training%20Group%20RAAF">Air Force Training Group</a>, a <a href="Force%20Element%20Group">force element group</a> under Air Command, in 2006. Air Command thus became the sole command-level organisation in the RAAF.

The RAAF raised eight area commands over the course of World War II, and five of them continued to operate into the 1950s:

The Triumph of Cleopatra

The Triumph of Cleopatra, also known as Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia and The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia, is an <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> by English artist <a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a>. It was first exhibited in 1821, and is now in the <a href="Lady%20Lever%20Art%20Gallery">Lady Lever Art Gallery</a> in <a href="Port%20Sunlight">Port Sunlight</a> across the <a href="River%20Mersey">River Mersey</a> from <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>. During the 1810s Etty had become widely respected among staff and students at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts">Royal Academy of Arts</a>, in particular for his use of colour and ability to paint realistic flesh tones. Despite having exhibited at every <a href="Summer%20Exhibition">Summer Exhibition</a> since 1811 he attracted little commercial or critical interest. In 1820 he exhibited "The Coral Finder", which showed nude figures on a <a href="gilded">gilded</a> boat. This painting attracted the attention of <a href="Francis%20Freeling">Sir Francis Freeling</a>, who commissioned a similar painting on a more ambitious scale.

"The Triumph of Cleopatra" illustrates a scene from <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>'s "<a href="Parallel%20Lives">Life of Antony</a>" and Shakespeare's "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>", in which Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, travels to <a href="Tarsus%2C%20Mersin">Tarsus</a> in <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a> aboard a magnificently decorated ship to cement an alliance with the Roman general <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a>. An intentionally cramped and crowded composition, it shows a huge group of people in various states of undress, gathering on the bank to watch the ship's arrival. Although not universally admired in the press, the painting was an immediate success, making Etty famous almost overnight. Buoyed by its reception, Etty devoted much of the next decade to creating further <a href="history%20paintings">history paintings</a> containing <a href="nude%20%28art%29">nude</a> figures, becoming renowned for his combination of nudity and moral messages.

<a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a> was born in <a href="York">York</a> in 1787, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>. On completing his seven-year <a href="indenture">indenture</a> he moved to London "with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours", with the aim of emulating the <a href="Old%20Masters">Old Masters</a> and becoming a <a href="history%20painting">history painter</a>. Etty gained acceptance to the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20Schools">Royal Academy Schools</a> in early 1807. After a year spent studying under the renowned portrait painter <a href="Thomas%20Lawrence">Thomas Lawrence</a>, Etty returned to the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a>, drawing in the <a href="life%20class">life class</a> and copying other paintings. He was unsuccessful in all the Academy's competitions, and every painting he submitted for the <a href="Summer%20Exhibition">Summer Exhibition</a> was rejected.

In 1811, one of his paintings, "Telemachus Rescues Antiope from the Fury of the Wild Boar", was finally accepted for the Summer Exhibition. Etty was becoming widely respected at the Royal Academy for his painting, particularly his use of colour and his ability to produce realistic flesh tones, and from 1811 onwards had at least one work accepted for the Summer Exhibition each year. However, he had little commercial success and generated little interest over the next few years.
At the 1820 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited "The Coral Finder: Venus and her Youthful Satellites Arriving at the Isle of Paphos". Strongly inspired by <a href="Titian">Titian</a>, "The Coral Finder" depicts <a href="Venus%20Victrix">Venus Victrix</a> lying nude in a golden boat, surrounded by scantily-clad attendants. It was sold at exhibition to piano manufacturer Thomas Tomkinson for £30 (about £ in 2019 terms).

<a href="Francis%20Freeling">Sir Francis Freeling</a> admired "The Coral Finder" at its exhibition, and learning that it had been sold he commissioned Etty to paint a similar picture on a more ambitious scale, for a fee of 200 guineas (about £ in 2019 terms). Etty had for some time been musing on the possibility of a painting of <a href="Cleopatra">Cleopatra</a>, and took the opportunity provided by Freeling to paint a picture of her based loosely on the composition of "The Coral Finder".

"The Triumph of Cleopatra" is based loosely on <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>'s "<a href="Parallel%20Lives">Life of Antony</a>" as repeated in Shakespeare's "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>", in which Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, travels to <a href="Tarsus%2C%20Mersin">Tarsus</a> in <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a> aboard a grand ship to cement an alliance with the Roman general <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a>.

While superficially similar to "The Coral Finder", "Cleopatra" is more closely related to the style of <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Regnault">Jean-Baptiste Regnault</a>, with its deliberately cramped and crowded composition. The individual figures are intentionally out of proportion to each other and to the ship, while a large number of figures are tightly positioned within a relatively small section of the painting.
As well as from Regnault, the work borrows elements from Titian, <a href="Rubens">Rubens</a> and classical sculpture. The figures are painted as groups, and while each figure and group of figures is carefully arranged and painted, the combination of groups gives the appearance of a confused mass surrounding the ship when the painting is viewed as a whole. (Etty's 1958 biographer Dennis Farr comments that contains elements enough for three or four paintings no less ambitious but more maturely planned.") The scene includes a number of images based on drawings Etty had sketched while out and about in London, such as the mother holding up her baby to see the view and the crowd on the roof of a temple in the background. It also includes elements of European painting that Etty had learned while copying Old Master artworks as a student, such as the <a href="putto">putti</a> in the sky. Etty greatly admired the <a href="Venetian%20school%20%28art%29">Venetian school</a>, and the painting includes obvious borrowings from Titian and other Venetian artists. It also contains a number of elements from the paintings of Rubens, such as the <a href="Nereid">Nereid</a>s and <a href="Triton%20%28mythology%29">Triton</a> in the sea in front of the ship.

Unusually for an English painting of the period in its representation of a queen of an African country the group of Cleopatra's attendants includes both dark- and light-skinned figures shown on equal terms and with equal prominence. From the earliest days of his career Etty had been interested in depicting variations in skin colour, and "The Missionary Boy", believed to be his oldest significant surviving painting, shows a dark-skinned child.

"Cleopatra" caused an immediate sensation; Etty later claimed that the day after the Summer Exhibition opened he "awoke famous". The May 1821 issue of "<a href="The%20Gentleman%27s%20Magazine">The Gentleman's Magazine</a>" hailed "Cleopatra" as "belonging to the highest class", and <a href="Charles%20Robert%20Leslie">Charles Robert Leslie</a> described it as "a splendid triumph of colour". The painting did not meet with universal approval. "Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine" conceded that the painting had been "seen and admired at the Royal Academy" but condemned Etty's taking a mythological approach to a historical subject:

Etty attempted to replicate the success of "Cleopatra", and his next significant exhibited work was "<a href="Youth%20on%20the%20Prow%2C%20and%20Pleasure%20at%20the%20Helm%23Versions">A Sketch from One of Gray's Odes (Youth on the Prow)</a>", exhibited at the <a href="British%20Institution">British Institution</a> in January 1822. As with "The Coral Finder" and "Cleopatra", this painting showed a gilded boat filled with nude figures, and its exhibition provoked condemnation from "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>":
Despite the tone, Etty was pleased to be noticed by a newspaper as influential as "The Times", and much later confessed how delighted he was that the ""Times" noticed me. I felt my chariot wheels were on the right road to fame and honour, and I now drove on like another Jehu!" Possibly as a result of the criticism in "The Times", Freeling asked Etty to overpaint the figures in the foreground of "Cleopatra". In 1829, after Etty had become a respected artist, Freeling allowed the restoration of the figures to their original condition.

The criticism did little to dissuade Etty from attempting to reproduce the success of "Cleopatra", and he concentrated on painting further history paintings containing <a href="nude%20%28art%29">nude</a> figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including "Cleopatra"), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages.
In 1823–24 Etty made an extended trip to study in France and Italy, and returned a highly accomplished artist. His monumental 304 by 399 cm (10 ft by 13 ft 1 in) 1825 painting "" was extremely well-received, and Etty began to be spoken of as one of England's finest painters. In February 1828 Etty soundly defeated <a href="John%20Constable">John Constable</a> by eighteen votes to five to become a full <a href="Royal%20Academician">Royal Academician</a>, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. On occasion he would re-use elements from "Cleopatra" in his later paintings, such as the black soldier who squats on the side of the ship in "Cleopatra" and who also sits watching dancers in his 1828 "<a href="The%20World%20Before%20the%20Flood">The World Before the Flood</a>".

Etty continued to produce paintings ranging from <a href="still%20life">still life</a>s to formal portraits, and to attract both admiration for his technique and criticism for supposed obscenity, until his death in 1849. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, and his works fetched huge sums on resale. Changing tastes from the 1870s onwards meant history paintings in Etty's style fell rapidly out of fashion, and by the end of the 19th century, the value of all of his works had fallen below their original prices.

Despite its technical flaws, "Cleopatra" remained a favourite among many of Etty's admirers during his lifetime; in 1846 <a href="Elizabeth%20Rigby">Elizabeth Rigby</a> described it as a "glorious confusion of figures" and "that wonderful 'Cleopatra' of Etty's".

Following Freeling's death in 1836, "Cleopatra" was sold for 210 guineas, around the same price Freeling had paid for it, and entered the collection of <a href="Henry%20Labouchere%2C%201st%20Baron%20Taunton">Lord Taunton</a>. While in Taunton's ownership it was shown at a number of important exhibitions, including a major 1849 Etty retrospective, the <a href="Art%20Treasures%20Exhibition%2C%20Manchester%201857">Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857</a> and the <a href="1862%20International%20Exhibition">1862 International Exhibition</a>. Following Taunton's death in 1869 it was sold to a succession of owners for a variety of prices, peaking at 500 guineas (about £ in 2019 terms) in 1880 and dropping in price on each subsequent resale. In 1911 it was bought for 240 guineas (about £ in 2019 terms) by <a href="William%20Lever%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Leverhulme">William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme</a>, who was a great admirer of Etty and had a number of his paintings hanging in the entrance hall of his home. It has remained in the collection Leverhulme assembled, housed from 1922 in the <a href="Lady%20Lever%20Art%20Gallery">Lady Lever Art Gallery</a>, ever since.

Killer Instinct Gold

Killer Instinct Gold is a 1996 <a href="fighting%20video%20game">fighting video game</a> based on the <a href="arcade%20game">arcade game</a> "<a href="Killer%20Instinct%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B2">Killer Instinct 2</a>". The game was developed by <a href="Rare%20%28company%29">Rare</a> and released by <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> for the <a href="Nintendo%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B64">Nintendo 64</a> <a href="video%20game%20console">video game console</a>. As in <a href="Killer%20Instinct">other series entries</a>, players control characters who fight on a 2D plane set against a 3D background. Players press buttons to punch and kick their opponent in chains of successive hits, known as <a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combos</a>. Large combo successions lead to stronger attacks and brutal, stylistic <a href="finisher%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">finisher moves</a> underscored by an announcer. Charactersincluding a gargoyle, a ninja, and a <a href="femme%20fatale">femme fatale</a>fight in settings such as a jungle and a spaceship. "Killer Instinct Gold" includes the arcade release's characters, combos, and 3D, <a href="pre-rendered">pre-rendered</a> environments, but excludes its <a href="full-motion%20video">full-motion video</a> sequences and some <a href="voiceovers">voiceovers</a> due to restrictions of the <a href="game%20cartridge">cartridge media format</a>. The "Gold" release adds a training mode, new camera views, and improved audiovisuals.

Rare was a prominent <a href="second-party%20developer">second-party developer</a> for Nintendo in the 1990s, and their "Killer Instinct" series was produced as an exclusive partnership in response to the popularity of "<a href="Mortal%20Kombat">Mortal Kombat</a>". Following the success of the <a href="Killer%20Instinct%20%281994%20video%20game%29">1995 "Killer Instinct"</a> <a href="Porting%20of%20video%20games">port</a> for the <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, Rare began a sequel for the same platform but transitioned development to its successor, the Nintendo 64, upon its unveiling. "Gold" was scheduled as a <a href="launch%20title">launch title</a> for the new console but was delayed until its North American release in November 1996. It was released in other regions in May 1997. "Gold" was later included in Rare's 2015 <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> retrospective compilation, "<a href="Rare%20Replay">Rare Replay</a>".

Reviewers preferred the Nintendo 64 port over the arcade release, and appreciated its audiovisual enhancements, but felt that its <a href="computer%20graphics">graphical</a> upgrades and memorization-based combo gameplay were insufficient when compared to fighting games like "<a href="Tekken%202">Tekken 2</a>" and "<a href="Virtua%20Fighter%202">Virtua Fighter 2</a>". Critics recommended "Gold" primarily for fans of the series and genre, but "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>" reported that even fans were upset by changes in the combo system and the absence of several well-liked characters. "Gold" ultimately did not replicate the success of its Super NES predecessor, and the series remained dormant through its 2002 acquisition by <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> until <a href="Killer%20Instinct%20%282013%20video%20game%29">its 2013 reboot</a>.

"Killer Instinct Gold" is a <a href="Porting%20of%20video%20games">port</a> of the <a href="arcade%20game">arcade</a> <a href="fighting%20video%20game">fighting video game</a> "<a href="Killer%20Instinct%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B2">Killer Instinct 2</a>". Like other entries in the "<a href="Killer%20Instinct">Killer Instinct</a>" series, two characters controlled by humans or <a href="Artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">artificial intelligence</a> fight in <a href="versus%20fighting%20game">one-on-one</a> matches to deplete their opponent's <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">health meter</a>. While the characters move and attack on a 2D plane, the background is depicted in <a href="pre-rendered">pre-rendered</a> 3D and gives <a href="2.5D">the appearance of depth</a>. Players fight with a six-button setup: three punch buttons and three kick buttons, similar to the controls in "<a href="Street%20Fighter%20II">Street Fighter II</a>". Players can chain together a series of hits into "<a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combos</a>" for increased damage, with some combos requiring a specific, memorized sequences of button presses. Multiple hit combos lead to stronger attacks and brutal, stylistic <a href="finisher%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">finisher moves</a>, or "fatalities". Characters on the receiving end of a combo can interrupt the sequence with a "<a href="combo%20breaker">combo breaker</a>" move. An announcer narrates major game moments with phrases like, "Awesome combo!"

"Gold" features arcade, team, and tournament gameplay modes. The game's new "practice mode" lets players rehearse their skills and follow tutorials. In the new <a href="knockout%20tournament">knockout tournament</a> mode, players cycle through a preselected team of characters when their current character is eliminated. "Gold" features the same characters, combos, and environments available in the arcade "Killer Instinct 2". Players can <a href="unlockable%20%28gaming%29">unlock</a> new character appearances, gameplay <a href="difficulty%20levels">difficulty levels</a>, and an additional playable character. "Gold" and "Killer Instinct 2" shared roster contains ten characters in total: three new additions and seven returning from <a href="Killer%20Instinct%20%281994%20video%20game%29">the previous title</a>. Characters include a gargoyle, a ninja, and a <a href="femme%20fatale">femme fatale</a>. Fights are set in spaceship, jungle, and castle settings, among others, and some backgrounds are interactive. "Gold" features new camera functions that automatically zoom to better frame the fight. The release also includes enhancements to the 3D backgrounds and an upgraded soundtrack, but excludes the <a href="full-motion%20video">full-motion video</a> sequences and some <a href="voiceovers">voiceovers</a> from the arcade release due to the Nintendo 64's <a href="game%20cartridge">cartridge media</a> <a href="Computer%20data%20storage">data storage</a> restrictions. While "Gold" backgrounds are fluidly animated in 60 <a href="frames%20per%20second">frames per second</a>, its character animations have fewer frames than its arcade equivalent.

"Killer Instinct Gold" was <a href="video%20game%20development">developed</a> by <a href="Rare%20%28company%29">Rare</a> during a time when the British company was becoming a prominent <a href="second-party%20developer">second-party developer</a> and ally for <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>, the game's <a href="video%20game%20publishing">publisher</a>. Rare modeled its "Killer Instinct" series on the "<a href="Mortal%20Kombat">Mortal Kombat</a>" fighting game series. As a departure from fighting game staples such as "Street Fighter", both "Killer Instinct" and "Mortal Kombat" championed an aggressively fast pace of gameplay and placed less emphasis on patience and mastery. The "Killer Instinct" series began as an arcade game (1994) and became known as "Nintendo's version of "Mortal Kombat"" upon its release on the company's <a href="Super%20NES">Super NES</a> (1995) and <a href="Game%20Boy">Game Boy</a> (1995). The <a href="video%20game%20industry">industry</a> expected a sequel after the Super NES version's wide success, with over three million copies sold. Following market demand, Rare began development on a sequel for the arcade. They had a Super NES version in development, but transitioned to the newer Nintendo 64 after the console's announcement. The "Killer Instinct" development team split itself between the arcade version and the Nintendo 64 release that would become "Killer Instinct Gold". The latter began work as soon as Rare received its Nintendo 64 <a href="development%20kit">development kit</a>.

The seven-person development team started work on the sequel with the ideas that did not fit into the original. They also incorporated feedback from "Killer Instinct" players. "Killer Instinct 2" art, design, and programming changed continuously throughout development up until its release. Kevin Bayliss designed the characters and Chris Tilston developed the <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> with feedback from Nintendo's <a href="Ken%20Lobb">Ken Lobb</a>. Rare used compression technology to fit the arcade version onto the smaller Nintendo 64 <a href="cartridge%20%28electronic%29">cartridge</a>. While "Killer Instinct" was planned to showcase the Nintendo 64's power, the console was more limited than Rare's arcade setup, and Rare had to optimize the arcade version to run on the console. The arcade version used an animation to give the illusion of the camera panning horizontally, but the console version used static image files with less detail. Both the arcade and console versions use the same graphic engine and character roster.

The game was originally scheduled to be among the first two <a href="launch%20titles">launch titles</a> for the Nintendo 64, but missed the <a href="release%20window">release window</a>. "Gold" released in North America on November 25, 1996, and in other countries the following year, on May 9, 1997. Its soundtrack received a <a href="compact%20disc">compact disc</a> release, which was rare for Western video games in the 1990s. Rare, under contract, ultimately finished its Super NES port of "Killer Instinct 2", but Nintendo chose not to release it.

In 1996, reviewers compared "Gold" favorably to "Killer Instinct 2", but thought that its <a href="computer%20graphics">graphics</a> were not sufficiently upgraded. Doug Perry ("<a href="IGN">IGN</a>") felt that the "Killer Instinct 2" graphics in "Gold" appeared dated and gave it a "cheesy 80s feel". He and Ed Lomas ("<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">CVG</a>") noticed fewer animation frames when compared with the arcade release. "IGN" preferred "Gold" crisp music but would have liked more characters and distinctions from the arcade version. "<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>" named "Gold" the best entry in the series at the time, but other reviewers only recommended "Gold" for fans of the series and genre and those most desperate for a Nintendo 64 fighting game. Colin Williamson ("AllGame") said that "Killer Instinct Gold" was best for players who want ""Mortal Kombat" on speed" with a "hyperactive <a href="Barry%20White">Barry White</a>" announcer.

Within the fighting game genre, "GameSpot" considered "Gold" to be better than the other Nintendo 64 fighting game, "<a href="Mortal%20Kombat%20Trilogy">Mortal Kombat Trilogy</a>". "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" readers chose "Gold" as the second best fighting game of 1996 after "<a href="Tekken%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B2">Tekken 2</a>". "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" and Marcus Hawkins ("<a href="N64%20Magazine">N64 Magazine</a>") agreed that "Tekken 2" and "<a href="Virtua%20Fighter%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B2">Virtua Fighter 2</a>" had outclassed "Killer Instinct Gold". "N64" concluded that even in the Nintendo 64's then-meager catalog of titles, "Killer Instinct Gold" did not distinguish itself, and thus had a lifespan of "weeks rather than months". "Killer Instinct Gold" waned from a celebrated announcement to a quiet European release.

Reviewers highly praised the game's sound and environment backdrops, but noted blurriness in the character animations. "IGN" appreciated its stereo sound, special effects, and camera work. Scary Larry ("GamePro") liked "Gold" sound except for the explosion and "death screech" sound effects. "GameSpot" considered the graphics "near perfect" apart from the character animations. ("CVG" wrote that characters appeared blurry because of "fuzzy <a href="anti-aliasing">anti-aliasing</a>" when the camera zoomed in.) "Game Informer" was similarly impressed by the graphics, but one reviewer commented that "Gold" had few other positive features. As an exception, "GamePro" praised the "lively" character animations over the "mildly annoying" backgrounds.

While "GamePro" gave the game perfect ratings in controls and fun, "Next Generation" considered the controls almost as awkward as they were on the Super NES and ultimately wrote that the game was "not much fun". Many reviewers criticized how "Gold" combo-based gameplay diminished the importance of skill. "IGN" wrote that this shallow emphasis on "archaic" combo sequence memorization prevented creative improvisation. "CVG" wrote that "Gold" had little "flow": every match was focused on huge combos rather than small, strategic moves. Thus, players were forced to train before they could effectively produce combos long enough to win matches. Multiple reviewers praised its training mode, which "CVG" also liked in the game's Super NES predecessor.

"Killer Instinct Gold" was the fifth best-selling video game of the 1996 <a href="Christmas%20shopping%20season">Christmas shopping season</a> according to TRST data.

After the 1996 "Killer Instinct Gold" did not sell as well as the Super NES version of the original, the series went dormant. "IGN" reported in 2010 that "Killer Instinct Gold" had upset series fans by changing the combo move sets and omitting "fan favorite" characters from the original. The website added that Rare knew that between all its franchises, "Killer Instinct" had the most fan interest in a new series entry. <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> purchased Rare in 2002, ending the acquisition's prominent alliance with Nintendo. Microsoft and Rare <a href="Killer%20Instinct%20%282013%20video%20game%29">revived the series</a> for the <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> platform in 2013. In 2014, "<a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a>" retrospectively ranked "Gold" the 35th best game on the Nintendo 64 console.

"Killer Instinct Gold" was later <a href="Video%20game%20console%20emulator">emulated</a> in the August 2015 Xbox One compilation of 30 Rare titles, "<a href="Rare%20Replay">Rare Replay</a>". "<a href="Nintendo%20Life">Nintendo Life</a>" wrote that "Gold" graphics had not aged well. The "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">New York Daily News</a>" reported that "Killer Instinct Gold", while "underrated" in its time, had withered into an outdated frustration as the anthology's biggest letdown. "<a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a>" singled out "Gold" as the collection's worst title, because it was a "barebones" "Killer Instinct 2". Twenty years after the original release, "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>" wrote that while "Killer Instinct" was popular in arcades, it had been outdone by "Tekken 2" and "Virtua Fighter 2" by 1996, and ultimately proved mediocre in comparison.

Kealoha enlisted in the <a href="41st%20United%20States%20Colored%20Infantry">41st United States Colored Infantry</a>, a <a href="United%20States%20Colored%20Troops">USC regiment</a> formed in <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. Participating in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Petersburg">Siege of Petersburg</a>, he and another Hawaiian soldier met the Hawaiʻi-born Colonel <a href="Samuel%20C.%20Armstrong">Samuel Chapman Armstrong</a>, who recorded their encounter in a letter home. With the 41st USCT, Kealoha was present at the surrender of Confederate General <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> and the <a href="Army%20of%20Northern%20Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a> at <a href="Appomattox%20Court%20House%20National%20Historical%20Park">Appomattox Court House</a> on April 9, 1865. After the war, Kealoha returned to Hawaiʻi. He died on March 5, 1877, and was buried in an unmarked grave in Honolulu's <a href="Oahu%20Cemetery">Oʻahu Cemetery</a>.

The legacy and contributions of Kealoha and other Hawaiian participants in the American Civil War were largely forgotten except in the private circles of descendants and historians, but in later years there was a revival of interest in the Hawaiian community. In 2010, these "Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War" were commemorated with a bronze plaque erected along the memorial pathway at the <a href="National%20Memorial%20Cemetery%20of%20the%20Pacific">National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific</a> in Honolulu. In 2014, through another local effort, a grave marker was dedicated over J. R. Kealoha's burial site, which had remained unmarked for 137 years.

After the outbreak of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii">Kingdom of Hawaiʻi</a> under King <a href="Kamehameha%20IV">Kamehameha IV</a> declared its neutrality on August 26, 1861. Many <a href="Native%20Hawaiian">Native Hawaiian</a>s and Hawaiʻi-born Americans (mainly descendants of American missionaries) abroad and in the islands volunteered and enlisted in the military regiments of various states in the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> and the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>. Native Hawaiians participating in the American wars during its period of independence was not unheard of. Individual Native Hawaiians had served in the United States Navy and Army since the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, and even more served during the American Civil War. Many Hawaiians sympathized with the Union because of Hawaiʻi's ties to <a href="New%20England">New England</a> through its missionaries and the whaling industries, and the ideological opposition of many to the institution of <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a>.

Nothing is known about the life of J. R. Kealoha before the war. He enlisted in 1864 as a <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a> and was assigned to the <a href="41st%20United%20States%20Colored%20Troops">41st Regiment United States Colored Troops</a> (USCT), a colored regiment formed in <a href="Camp%20William%20Penn">Camp William Penn</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, between September 30 and December 7, 1864, under the command of Colonel <a href="Llewellyn%20F.%20Haskell">Llewellyn F. Haskell</a>. Most Native Hawaiians who participated in the war were assigned to the <a href="United%20States%20Colored%20Troops">colored regiments</a> because of their dark skin color and the segregationist policy in the military at the time. Kealoha is one of the few Hawaiian soldiers of the Civil War whose real name is known; many combatants served under anglicized pseudonyms because they were easier for English-speaking Americans to pronounce than <a href="Hawaiian%20language">Hawaiian language</a> names. They were often registered as "<a href="Kanaka%20%28Pacific%20Island%20worker%29">kanakas</a>", the 19th-century term for Hawaiians and <a href="Pacific%20Islander">Pacific Islander</a>s, with the "<a href="Hawaiian%20Islands">Sandwich Islands</a>" (Hawaiʻi) noted as their place of origin.

From October 1864 to April 1865, Kealoha fought in the Richmond–Petersburg Campaign, better known as the <a href="Siege%20of%20Petersburg">Siege of Petersburg</a>. During the campaign, Kealoha and another Hawaiian named Kaiwi, of the <a href="28th%20Regiment%20United%20States%20Colored%20Troops">28th Regiment United States Colored Troops</a>, came across <a href="Samuel%20C.%20Armstrong">Samuel Chapman Armstrong</a>, a son of an <a href="Richard%20Armstrong%20%28Hawaii%29">American missionary</a> and a native of <a href="Maui">Maui</a>. Armstrong wrote of the encounter in a letter home that was later published in the Hawaiian missionary newspaper "The Friend" in 1865:
Yesterday, as my orderly was holding my horse, I asked him where he was from. He said he was from Hawaii! He proved to be a full-blood Kanaka, by the name of Kealoha, who came from the Islands last year. There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing them very much and we had a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to have seen me.

Kealoha survived months of <a href="trench%20warfare">trench warfare</a> during the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign and fought with the 41st USCT at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Appomattox%20Court%20House">Battle of Appomattox Court House</a>; he was present at the surrender of Confederate General <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> and the <a href="Army%20of%20Northern%20Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a> at <a href="Appomattox%20Court%20House%20National%20Historical%20Park">Appomattox Court House</a> on April 9, 1865. The 41st USCT regiment was mustered out of service on November 10, 1865, at <a href="Brownsville%2C%20Texas">Brownsville, Texas</a>, and was discharged December 14, 1865, at Philadelphia. Kealoha's enlistment of service is not present in any existing records or history from the 41st USCT regiment. Historians Justin Vance and Anita Manning speculate that "it is possible that his service is noted under a different name" or his name was never recorded because only the muster-out rolls from the regiment were returned to the Adjutant General's office after the unit disbanded.

After the war, Kealoha returned to Hawaiʻi. He died on March 5, 1877, and was buried with eighteen other Native Hawaiians in an unmarked grave in Section 1, Lot 56 of the <a href="Oahu%20Cemetery">Oʻahu Cemetery</a>, <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>. During the <a href="Territory%20of%20Hawaii">Hawaii Territorial period</a>, Kealoha's Civil War service was recorded by the United Veterans Service Council (UVSC), a precursor of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Veterans%20Affairs">United States Department of Veterans Affairs</a> (VA), which included his name in their records as a "Deceased Veteran" and listed the location of his burial.

For 137 years, Kealoha's burial site remained unmarked until a Hawaiian group affiliated with the organization Hawaiʻi Civil War Round Table, consisting of Anita Manning, Nanette Napoleon, Eric Mueller, and Justin Vance, started an effort to give him a grave marker. Historian Anita Manning, a member of this group, had discovered the records containing Kealoha's name at the Hawaii State Archives in 2011. It listed his service in the war and the location of his burial place, but when Manning went to the site of his grave, she was disappointed by the absence of a headstone. Giving the reason for the significance of Kealoha's service, Manning stated:

Kealoha represents many Hawaiian men and men from Hawaii who served in the Civil War who knew what they were getting into, who took a risk, and we all are the beneficiaries of that work and risk that they took ... We owe it to them to recognize that service.

The group petitioned the United States Department of Veterans Affairs for a marker for Kealoha but the Department denied the request because there was no next of kin to approve the request. A 2009 policy change enacted in 2012 required that only next of kin could request VA memorials. After the request's denial, Honor Life Memorials, a local monument maker, donated a granite marker for Kealoha.

The marker was formally dedicated and unveiled on October 25, 2014. Dressed in period costumes, members of the Hawaiʻi Civil War Round Table and others took part in the dedication ceremony at Oʻahu Cemetery. The ceremony was marked by military honors and a gun salute by a unit of Civil War re-enactors. <a href="Hawaiian%20religion">Hawaiian</a> minister Kahu Silva presided over the dedication ceremony, and in accordance with <a href="Culture%20of%20the%20Native%20Hawaiians">traditional Hawaiian customs</a>, the consecrated marker was adorned with a sacred "<a href="Alyxia%20oliviformis">maile</a> <a href="lei%20%28garland%29">lei</a>" and a <a href="Acacia%20koa">"koa"</a> branch, representing "Kealoha's noble qualities of bravery, courage and valor." The marker is inscribed with his name, regiment, death date, and the Hawaiian and English text: "He Koa Hanohano, a brave and honorable soldier".

Other Hawaiian veterans of the Civil War are honored in Honolulu's <a href="National%20Memorial%20Cemetery%20of%20the%20Pacific">National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific</a> with a bronze memorial plaque that was erected in 2010 in recognition of the "Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War", the more than one hundred documented Hawaiians who served with the Union and the Confederacy. As of 2014, researchers have identified 119 documented Hawaiian and Hawaiʻi-born combatants from historical records. The exact number remains unclear because of the lack of records. Of the 48 identified Native Hawaiian combatants, including <a href="James%20Wood%20Bush">James Wood Bush</a> and <a href="Henry%20Ho%CA%BBolulu%20Pitman">Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman</a>, Kealoha is the only one buried in Hawaii whose gravesite is known. According to Hawaiian news reporter Chelsea Davis, Kealoha has come to "represents all the men of Hawaii who took up arms in America's Civil War but who have been forgotten."

Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret

Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret is an <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> on canvas by English artist <a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a>, first exhibited in 1833 and now in <a href="Tate%20Britain">Tate Britain</a>. Intended to illustrate the virtues of honour and chastity, it depicts a scene from <a href="Edmund%20Spenser">Edmund Spenser</a>'s "<a href="The%20Faerie%20Queene">The Faerie Queene</a>" in which the female warrior <a href="Britomartis">Britomart</a> slays the evil magician Busirane and frees his captive, the beautiful Amoret. In Spenser's original poem Amoret has been tortured and mutilated by the time of her rescue, but Etty disliked the depiction of violence and portrayed her as unharmed.

Despite being a depiction of an occult ritual, a violent death, a partly nude woman and strongly implied sexual torture, "Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret" was uncontroversial on its first exhibition in 1833 and was critically well received. Sold by Etty to a private collector in 1833, it passed through the hands of several more before entering the collection of the <a href="Lady%20Lever%20Art%20Gallery">Lady Lever Art Gallery</a>. In 1958, it was acquired by the <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a>, and it remains in the collection of Tate Britain.

<a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a> was born in 1787 in <a href="York">York</a>, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an <a href="apprentice">apprentice</a> printer in <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>. On completing his seven-year <a href="indenture">indenture</a> he moved to London "with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours", with the aim of emulating the <a href="Old%20Master">Old Master</a>s and becoming a <a href="history%20painting">history painter</a>. Etty gained acceptance to the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20Schools">Royal Academy Schools</a> in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter <a href="Thomas%20Lawrence">Thomas Lawrence</a>, Etty returned to the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a>, drawing at the <a href="life%20class">life class</a> and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, "<a href="The%20Arrival%20of%20Cleopatra%20in%20Cilicia">The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia</a>" (also known as "The Triumph of Cleopatra"). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts%23Membership">Royal Academician</a> in 1828, ahead of <a href="John%20Constable">John Constable</a>. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones.
Following the exhibition of "Cleopatra", Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing <a href="nude%20%28art%29">nude</a> figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including "Cleopatra"), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Suppression%20of%20Vice">Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice</a>. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received. (Etty's male nude portraits were primarily of mythological heroes and classical combat, genres in which the depiction of male nudity was considered acceptable in England.) From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks from the press, Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes but made conscious efforts to try to reflect moral lessons in his work.

"Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret" illustrates a scene from book III of "<a href="The%20Faerie%20Queene">The Faerie Queene</a>", a 16th-century allegorical epic poem by <a href="Edmund%20Spenser">Edmund Spenser</a>, in which Busirane, an evil <a href="Magician%20%28paranormal%29">sorcerer</a>, abducts the beautiful Amoret (representing married virtue), and tortures her to the point of death. The heroic female warrior <a href="Britomartis%23Spenser%27s%20%26quot%3BBritomart%26quot%3B">Britomart</a> (representing both <a href="chastity">chastity</a> and <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a>) battles through obstacles to reach the chamber in which Amoret is being held, and slays Busirane moments before he is able to kill Amoret.

"Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret" was intended by Etty to illustrate the virtues of chastity and honour. It shows the moment in which Busirane is interrupted by Britomart as he prepares to kill Amoret. Amoret is chained to a gilded <a href="Solomonic%20column">Solomonic column</a>, carved with depictions of <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a>, and her clothes fall from her shoulders as she struggles. Britomart, clad in armour, enters Busirane's <a href="Moorish%20architecture">Moorish</a> chamber, and tramples a blood-stained <a href="grimoire">grimoire</a> as she swings her sword. Busirane, naked from the waist up and with Chinese-style trousers and <a href="queue%20%28hairstyle%29">queue</a>, falls to the floor, his blade still pointing at Amoret's heart. Unusually for Etty, "Britomart" is painted very thinly, with the canvas weave still visible through the paint. Art historian Alison Smith considers that this was likely inspired by <a href="Henry%20Fuseli">Henry Fuseli</a>, who painted a depiction of Britomart using the same style of painting.

In the original poem, Busirane had tortured and cut out the heart of the still-living Amoret by the time of her rescue. When he came to paint "Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret" Etty had created numerous scenes of combat and death, and would later achieve a degree of critical approbation when it became known that he visited mortuaries to sketch cadavers to ensure the accuracy of his depictions of bodies in varying stages of decomposition. However, he had an aversion to "the offensive and revolting butchery, some have delighted and even revelled in", and disliked the depiction of gratuitous violence. Consequently, in Etty's work Amoret is depicted as physically unharmed by her ordeal, although his composition implies "sadistic torture and occult sexual sorcery".
Although there is a strong suggestion in his letters that in his early years he had a sexual encounter with one of his models and possibly also a sexual encounter of some kind while in Venice in 1823–24, Etty was devoutly Christian and famously abstemious. Alison Smith considers the composition of "Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret" a conscious effort on his part to praise the virtue of chastity by creating a "challenge for the presumably male viewer ... to vanquish lust and cast a pure gaze on vulnerable womanhood". Throughout his career Etty had championed the use of female models in life classes, creating some controversy, and this painting may have been intended to emphasise his belief that "To the pure in heart all things are pure".

In 1832, the exhibition of Etty's "<a href="Youth%20on%20the%20Prow%2C%20and%20Pleasure%20at%20the%20Helm">Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm</a>" had led to significant criticism in some parts of the press for its use of nude figures, with "<a href="The%20Morning%20Chronicle">The Morning Chronicle</a>" condemning it as an "indulgence of what we once hoped a classical, but which are now convinced, is a lascivious mind". When it was exhibited at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20Summer%20Exhibition">Royal Academy Summer Exhibition</a> in 1833, "Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret" received much more favourable treatment.

Although it depicted a near-nude woman, a violent death, an occult ritual and the strong implication of sexual torture, critical coverage was overwhelmingly positive. "<a href="The%20New%20Monthly%20Magazine">The New Monthly Magazine</a>" considered it "a wondrous and rare piece of colour", while "<a href="The%20Gentleman%27s%20Magazine">The Gentleman's Magazine</a>" considered it "a beautiful cabinet picture" of a "truly poetical character". The most effusive praise came from "<a href="Literary%20Gazette">The Literary Gazette</a>":

Etty considered "Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret" one of his major works.
Following its exhibition at the 1833 Summer Exhibition, it was exhibited in August of the same year at the <a href="Royal%20Manchester%20Institution">Royal Manchester Institution</a>. It was sold at this second exhibition for £157 (about £ in today's terms) to an anonymous collector listed in Etty's records only as "Mr. L., Manchester". It was one of 133 Etty paintings exhibited in a major <a href="retrospective%20exhibition">retrospective exhibition</a> of his work at the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Royal Society of Arts</a> in June–August 1849; during this exhibition it was sold on to <a href="Lord%20Charles%20Townshend%20%281785%E2%80%931853%29">Lord Charles Townshend</a> for a sum of 520 <a href="guineas">guineas</a> (about £ in today's terms).

Etty died in 1849, having continued working and exhibiting up to his death, and continued to be regarded by many as a pornographer. <a href="Charles%20Robert%20Leslie">Charles Robert Leslie</a> observed shortly after Etty's death that himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds". Interest in him declined as <a href="Victorian%20painting">new movements</a> came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the sales prices achieved by his paintings were falling below the original values.
Townshend sold "Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret" two years after Etty's death for 510 guineas. It then passed through the hands of several owners over subsequent years, selling for a slightly lower sum each time. It was likely an influence on <a href="John%20Everett%20Millais">John Everett Millais</a>'s 1870 "The Knight Errant", which also showed a distressed nude woman being rescued; although Millais disliked Etty's later works, several of his paintings were strongly influenced by the artist.

In 1919 "Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret" was bought for 410 guineas (about £ in today's terms) by <a href="William%20Lever%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Leverhulme">William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme</a>, and was one of the 13 Etty works transferred to the <a href="Lady%20Lever%20Art%20Gallery">Lady Lever Art Gallery</a>, where it remained until 1958. In 1958 it was bought by the <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a>, and it remains in <a href="Tate%20Britain">Tate Britain</a>. It was one of five Etty paintings shown as part of Tate Britain's "Exposed: The Victorian Nude" exhibition, and in 2011–12 it was exhibited as part of a major retrospective of Etty's work at the <a href="York%20Art%20Gallery">York Art Gallery</a>. In 2013 <a href="Franco%20Moretti">Franco Moretti</a> argued that "Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret" was the "prototypical" example of the Victorian nudes of the later 19th century in which nudity ceased to be a symbol of innocence and instead became a symbol of the coercion of women at the hands of savages, criminals and tyrants.

Slavery in ancient Greece

<a href="Slavery">Slavery</a> was a common practice in <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a>, as in other societies of the time. Some Ancient Greek writers (including, most notably, <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>) considered slavery natural and even necessary. This paradigm was notably questioned in <a href="Socratic%20dialogues">Socratic dialogues</a>; the <a href="Stoicism">Stoics</a> produced the first recorded condemnation of slavery.

Most activities were open to slaves except politics, which was reserved for citizens. The principal use of slaves was in agriculture, but hundreds of slaves were also used in stone quarries or mines, and perhaps two per household were domestic servants. It is certain that Athens had the largest slave population, with as many as 80,000 in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, with average of three or four slaves per household, except in poor families.

Modern <a href="historiography">historiographical</a> practice distinguishes between <a href="Personal%20property">chattel</a> slavery (personal possession, where the slave was regarded as a piece of property as opposed to a mobile member of society) versus land-bonded groups such as the <a href="penestae">penestae</a> of <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a> or the <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>n <a href="helots">helots</a>, who were more like medieval <a href="serfdom">serfs</a> (an enhancement to real estate). The chattel slave is an individual deprived of liberty and forced to submit to an owner, who may buy, sell, or lease them like any other chattel.

The academic study of slavery in ancient Greece is beset by significant methodological problems. Documentation is disjointed and very fragmented, focusing primarily on the city-state of <a href="Athens">Athens</a>. No treatises are specifically devoted to the subject, and jurisprudence was interested in slavery only as much as it provided a source of revenue. <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20comedy">Greek comedies</a> and <a href="Greek%20tragedy">tragedies</a> represented stereotypes, while <a href="iconography">iconography</a> made no substantial differentiation between slaves and <a href="Artisan">craftsmen</a>.

The ancient Greeks had several words to indicate slaves, which leads to textual ambiguity when they are studied out of their proper context. In <a href="Homer">Homer</a>, <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a> and <a href="Theognis%20of%20Megara">Theognis of Megara</a>, the slave was called ("dmōs"). The term has a general meaning but refers particularly to war prisoners taken as <a href="War%20looting">booty</a> (in other words, property). During the classical period, the Greeks frequently used ("andrapodon"), (literally, "one with the feet of a man") as opposed to ("tetrapodon"), "quadruped" or livestock. The most common word for slaves is ("doulos"), used in opposition to "free man" (, "eleútheros"); an earlier form of the former appears in <a href="Mycenaean%20Greece">Mycenaean</a> inscriptions as "do-e-ro", "male slave" (or "servant", "bondman"; Linear B: ), or "do-e-ra", "female slave" (or "maid-servant", "bondwoman"). The <a href="verb">verb</a> (which survives in Modern Greek, meaning "work") can be used metaphorically for other forms of dominion, as of one city over another or parents over their children. Finally, the term ("oiketēs") was used, as meaning "one who lives in house", referring to household servants.
Other terms used to indicate slaves were less precise and required context: 

Slaves were present through the <a href="Mycenaean%20Greece">Mycenaean civilization</a>, as documented in numerous tablets unearthed in <a href="Pylos">Pylos</a> 140. Two legal categories can be distinguished: "slaves (εοιο)" and "slaves of the god (θεοιο)", the god in this case probably being <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a>. Slaves of the god are always mentioned by name and own their own land; their legal status is close to that of freemen. The nature and origin of their bond to the divinity is unclear. The names of common slaves show that some of them came from <a href="Kythira">Kythera</a>, <a href="Chios">Chios</a>, <a href="Lemnos">Lemnos</a> or <a href="Halicarnassus">Halicarnassus</a> and were probably enslaved as a result of <a href="piracy">piracy</a>. The tablets indicate that unions between slaves and freemen were common and that slaves could work and own land. It appears that the major division in Mycenaean civilization was not between a free individual and a slave but rather if the individual was in the palace or not.
There is no continuity between the Mycenaean era and the time of <a href="Homer">Homer</a>, where social structures reflected those of the <a href="Greek%20dark%20ages">Greek dark ages</a>. The terminology differs: the slave is no longer "do-e-ro" (doulos) but "dmōs". In the <a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>, slaves are mainly women taken as booty of war, while men were either ransomed or killed on the battlefield. In the "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>", the slaves also seem to be mostly women. These slaves were servants and sometimes concubines. There were some male slaves, especially in the "Odyssey", a prime example being the <a href="swineherd">swineherd</a> Eumaeus. The slave was distinctive in being a member of the core part of the "oikos" ("family unit", "household"): <a href="Laertes">Laertes</a> eats and drinks with his servants; in the winter, he sleeps in their company. The term "dmōs" is not considered pejorative, and <a href="Eumaeus">Eumaeus</a>, the "divine" swineherd, bears the same <a href="Epithets%20in%20Homer">Homeric epithet</a> as the Greek heroes. Slavery remained, however, a disgrace. Eumaeus himself declares, "Zeus, of the far-borne voice, takes away the half of a man's virtue, when the day of slavery comes upon him".
It is difficult to determine when slave trading began in the archaic period. In "<a href="Works%20and%20Days">Works and Days</a>" (8th century BC), <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a> owns numerous "dmōes" although their status is unclear. The presence of "douloi" is confirmed by lyric poets such as <a href="Archilochus">Archilochus</a> or <a href="Theognis%20of%20Megara">Theognis of Megara</a>. According to epigraphic evidence, the homicide law of <a href="Draco%20%28lawgiver%29">Draco</a> (c. 620 BC) mentioned slaves. According to Plutarch, <a href="Solon">Solon</a> (c. 594-593 BC) forbade slaves from practising gymnastics and pederasty. By the end of the period, references become more common. Slavery becomes prevalent at the very moment when Solon establishes the basis for Athenian democracy. Classical scholar <a href="Moses%20Finley">Moses Finley</a> likewise remarks that Chios, which, according to <a href="Theopompus">Theopompus</a>, was the first city to organize a slave trade, also enjoyed an early democratic process (in the 6th century BC). He concludes that "one aspect of Greek history, in short, is the advance hand in hand, of freedom "and" slavery."

All activities were open to slaves with the exception of politics. For the Greeks, politics was the only occupation worthy of a citizen, the rest being relegated wherever possible to non-citizens. It was status that was of importance, not occupation.
The principal use of slavery was in <a href="Agriculture%20of%20ancient%20Greece">agriculture</a>, the foundation of the Greek economy. Some small landowners might own one slave, or even two. An abundant literature of manuals for landowners (such as the <a href="Oeconomicus">"Economy"</a> of <a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a> or that of <a href="Pseudo-Aristotle">Pseudo-Aristotle</a>) confirms the presence of dozens of slaves on the larger estates; they could be common labourers or foremen. The extent to which slaves were used as a labour force in farming is disputed. It is certain that rural slavery was very common in Athens, and that ancient Greece did not know of the immense slave populations found on the Roman "<a href="latifundia">latifundia</a>".

Slave labour was prevalent in <a href="Mining">mines</a> and <a href="Quarry">quarries</a>, which had large slave populations, often leased out by rich private citizens. The <a href="strategos">strategos</a> <a href="Nicias">Nicias</a> leased a thousand slaves to the silver mines of <a href="Laurium">Laurium</a> in <a href="Attica">Attica</a>; Hipponicos, 600; and Philomidès, 300. Xenophon indicates that they received one <a href="obolus">obolus</a> per slave per day, amounting to 60 <a href="drachma">drachma</a>s per year. This was one of the most prized investments for Athenians. The number of slaves working in the Laurium mines or in the mills processing ore has been estimated at 30,000. Xenophon suggested that the city buy a large number of slaves, up to three state slaves per citizen, so that their leasing would assure the upkeep of all the citizens.
Slaves were also used as craftsmen and <a href="tradesperson">tradesperson</a>s. As in agriculture, they were used for labour that was beyond the capability of the family. The slave population was greatest in workshops: the shield factory of <a href="Lysias">Lysias</a> employed 120 slaves, and the father of <a href="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a> owned 32 cutlers and 20 bedmakers.

Slaves were also employed in the home. The domestic's main role was to stand in for his master at his trade and to accompany him on trips. In time of war he was <a href="Batman%20%28military%29">batman</a> to the <a href="hoplite">hoplite</a>. The female slave carried out domestic tasks, in particular bread baking and textile making. Only the poorest citizens did not possess a domestic slave.

It is difficult to estimate the number of slaves in ancient Greece, given the lack of a precise census and variations in definitions during that era. It is certain that Athens had the largest slave population, with as many as 80,000 in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, on average three or four slaves per household. In the 5th century BC, <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a> remarked on the desertion of 20,890 slaves during the <a href="Decelea">war of Decelea</a>, mostly tradesmen. The lowest estimate, of 20,000 slaves, during the time of <a href="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a>, corresponds to one slave per family. Between 317 BC and 307 BC, the tyrant <a href="Demetrius%20Phalereus">Demetrius Phalereus</a> ordered a general census of Attica, which arrived at the following figures: 21,000 citizens, 10,000 <a href="metic">metic</a>s and 400,000 slaves. The orator <a href="Hypereides">Hypereides</a>, in his "Against Areistogiton", recalls that the effort to enlist 15,000 male slaves of military age led to the defeat of the Southern Greeks at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chaeronea%20%28338%20BC%29">Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)</a>, which corresponds to the figures of <a href="Ctesicles">Ctesicles</a>.

According to the literature, it appears that the majority of free Athenians owned at least one slave. <a href="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a>, in "<a href="Plutus%20%28play%29">Plutus</a>", portrays poor peasants who have several slaves; Aristotle defines a house as containing freemen and slaves. Conversely, not owning even one slave was a clear sign of poverty. In the celebrated discourse of <a href="Lysias">Lysias</a> "For the Invalid", a cripple pleading for a pension explains "my income is very small and now I'm required to do these things myself and do not even have the means to purchase a slave who can do these things for me." However, the huge slave populations of the Romans were unknown in ancient Greece. When Athenaeus cites the case of Mnason, friend of Aristotle and owner of a thousand slaves, this appears to be exceptional. <a href="Plato">Plato</a>, owner of five slaves at the time of his death, describes the very rich as owning 50 slaves.
Thucydides estimates that the isle of <a href="Chios">Chios</a> had proportionally the largest number of slaves.

There were four primary sources of slaves: war, in which the defeated would become slaves to the victorious unless a more objective outcome was reached; <a href="piracy">piracy</a> (at sea); banditry (on land); and international trade.

By the rules of war of the period, the victor possessed absolute rights over the vanquished, whether they were soldiers or not. Enslavement, while not systematic, was common practice. <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a> recalls that 7,000 inhabitants of Hyccara in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> were taken prisoner by <a href="Nicias">Nicias</a> and sold for 120 <a href="Talent%20%28weight%29">talents</a> in the neighbouring village of <a href="Catania">Catania</a>. Likewise in 348 BC the population of <a href="Olynthus">Olynthus</a> was reduced to slavery, as was that of <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Thebes</a> in 335 BC by <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> and that of <a href="Mantineia">Mantineia</a> by the <a href="Achaean%20League">Achaean League</a>.

The existence of Greek slaves was a constant source of discomfort for free Greeks. The enslavement of cities was also a controversial practice. Some generals refused, such as the <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>ns <a href="Agesilaus%20II">Agesilaus II</a> and <a href="Callicratidas">Callicratidas</a>. Some cities passed accords to forbid the practice: in the middle of the 3rd century BC, <a href="Miletus">Miletus</a> agreed not to reduce any free <a href="Knossos">Knossian</a> to slavery, and vice versa. Conversely, the emancipation by ransom of a city that had been entirely reduced to slavery carried great prestige: <a href="Cassander">Cassander</a>, in 316 BC, restored Thebes. Before him, <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a> enslaved and then emancipated <a href="Stageira">Stageira</a>.

<a href="Piracy">Piracy</a> and banditry provided a significant and consistent supply of slaves, though the significance of this source varied according to era and region. Pirates and brigands would demand ransom whenever the status of their catch warranted it. Whenever ransom was not paid or not warranted, captives would be sold to a trafficker. In certain areas, piracy was practically a national specialty, described by Thucydides as "the old-fashioned" way of life. Such was the case in <a href="Acarnania">Acarnania</a>, <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, and <a href="Aetolia">Aetolia</a>. Outside of Greece, this was also the case with <a href="Illyria">Illyria</a>ns, <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>ns, and <a href="Etruscan%20civilization">Etruscans</a>. During the <a href="Hellenistic%20Greece">Hellenistic period</a>, <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>ns and the mountain peoples from the coasts of <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> could also be added to the list. <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> explains the popularity of the practice among the Cilicians by its profitability; <a href="Delos">Delos</a>, not far away, allowed for "moving myriad slaves daily". The growing influence of the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a>, a large consumer of slaves, led to development of the market and an aggravation of piracy. In the 1st century BC, however, the Romans largely eradicated piracy to protect the Mediterranean trade routes.

There was slave trade between kingdoms and states of the wider region. The fragmentary list of slaves confiscated from the property of the mutilators of the "<a href="Herma">Herma</a>i" mentions 32 slaves whose origins have been ascertained: 13 came from <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, 7 from <a href="Caria">Caria</a>, and the others came from <a href="Cappadocia">Cappadocia</a>, <a href="Scythia">Scythia</a>, <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a>, <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a>, <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="Ilyria">Ilyria</a>, <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a> and <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>. Local professionals sold their own people to Greek slave merchants. The principal centres of the slave trade appear to have been <a href="Ephesus">Ephesus</a>, <a href="Byzantium">Byzantium</a>, and even faraway <a href="Tanais">Tanais</a> at the mouth of the <a href="Don%20River%2C%20Russia">Don</a>. Some "barbarian" slaves were victims of war or localised piracy, but others were sold by their parents. There is a lack of direct evidence of slave traffic, but corroborating evidence exists. Firstly, certain nationalities are consistently and significantly represented in the slave population, such as the corps of <a href="Scythian%20archers">Scythian archers</a> employed by Athens as a police force—originally 300, but eventually nearly a thousand. Secondly, the names given to slaves in the <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20comedy">comedies</a> often had a geographical link; thus "Thratta", used by <a href="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a> in "<a href="The%20Wasps">The Wasps</a>", "<a href="The%20Acharnians">The Acharnians</a>", and "<a href="Peace%20%28play%29">Peace</a>", simply signified "Thracian woman". Finally, the nationality of a slave was a significant criterion for major purchasers; the ancient advice was not to concentrate too many slaves of the same origin in the same place, in order to limit the risk of revolt. It is also probable that, as with the Romans, certain nationalities were considered more productive as slaves than others.
The price of slaves varied in accordance with their ability. Xenophon valued a Laurion miner at 180 <a href="drachma">drachma</a>s; while a workman at major works was paid one <a href="drachma">drachma</a> per day. Demosthenes' father's cutlers were valued at 500 to 600 <a href="drachma">drachma</a>s each. Price was also a function of the quantity of slaves available; in the 4th century BC they were abundant and it was thus a buyer's market. A tax on sale revenues was levied by the market cities. For instance, a large helot market was organized during the festivities at the temple of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> at <a href="Actium">Actium</a>. The Acarnanian League, which was in charge of the logistics, received half of the tax proceeds, the other half going to the city of Anactorion, of which Actium was a part. Buyers enjoyed a guarantee against <a href="latent%20defect">latent defect</a>s; the transaction could be invalidated if the bought slave turned out to be crippled and the buyer had not been warned about it.

Curiously, it appears that the Greeks did not "breed" their slaves, at least during the Classical Era, though the proportion of houseborn slaves appears to have been rather large in <a href="Ptolemaic%20Egypt">Ptolemaic Egypt</a> and in <a href="manumission%20inscriptions%20at%20Delphi">manumission inscriptions at Delphi</a>. Sometimes the cause of this was natural; mines, for instance, were exclusively a male domain. On the other hand, there were many female domestic slaves. The example of African slaves in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">American South</a> on the other hand demonstrates that slave populations can multiply.

Xenophon advised that male and female slaves should be lodged separately, that "…nor children born and bred by our domestics without our knowledge and consent—no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad." The explanation is perhaps economic; even a skilled slave was cheap, so it may have been cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one. Additionally, childbirth placed the slave-mother's life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood.
<a href="House%20slave">Houseborn slaves</a> ("oikogeneis") often constituted a privileged class. They were, for example, entrusted to take the children to school; they were "<a href="Pedagogy">pedagogues</a>" in the first sense of the term. Some of them were the offspring of the master of the house, but in most cities, notably Athens, a child inherited the status of its mother.

The Greeks had many degrees of enslavement. There was a multitude of categories, ranging from free citizen to chattel slave, and including <a href="Penestae">Penestae</a> or <a href="helots">helots</a>, disenfranchised citizens, freedmen, bastards, and <a href="metic">metic</a>s. The common ground was the deprivation of civic rights.
<a href="Moses%20Finley">Moses Finley</a> proposed a set of criteria for different degrees of enslavement:

Athenian slaves were the property of their master (or of the state), who could dispose of them as he saw fit. He could give, sell, rent, or bequeath them. A slave could have a spouse and child, but the slave family was not recognized by the state, and the master could scatter the family members at any time. Slaves had fewer judicial rights than citizens and were represented by their master in all judicial proceedings. A misdemeanour that would result in a fine for the free man would result in a flogging for the slave; the ratio seems to have been one lash for one drachma. With several minor exceptions, the testimony of a slave was not admissible except under torture. Slaves were tortured in trials because they often remained loyal to their master. A famous example of a trusty slave was <a href="Themistocles">Themistocles</a>'s Persian slave <a href="Sicinnus">Sicinnus</a> (the counterpart of <a href="Ephialtes%20of%20Trachis">Ephialtes of Trachis</a>), who, despite his Persian origin, betrayed <a href="Xerxes%20I%20of%20Persia">Xerxes</a> and helped Athenians in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Salamis">Battle of Salamis</a>. Despite torture in trials, the Athenian slave was protected in an indirect way: if he was mistreated, the master could initiate litigation for damages and interest ( / "dikē blabēs"). Conversely, a master who excessively mistreated a slave could be prosecuted by any citizen ( / "graphē hybreōs"); this was not enacted for the sake of the slave, but to avoid violent excess ( / "<a href="hubris">hubris</a>").

<a href="Isocrates">Isocrates</a> claimed that "not even the most worthless slave can be put to death without trial"; the master's power over his slave was not absolute. <a href="Draco%20%28lawgiver%29">Draco</a>'s law apparently punished with death the murder of a slave; the underlying principle was: "was the crime such that, if it became more widespread, it would do serious harm to society?" The suit that could be brought against a slave's killer was not a suit for damages, as would be the case for the killing of cattle, but a ("dikē phonikē"), demanding punishment for the religious pollution brought by the shedding of blood. In the 4th century BC, the suspect was judged by the <a href="Palladion">Palladion</a>, a court which had jurisdiction over <a href="unintentional%20homicide">unintentional homicide</a>; the imposed penalty seems to have been more than a fine but less than death—maybe exile, as was the case in the murder of a Metic.
However, slaves did belong to their master's household. A newly-bought slave was welcomed with nuts and fruits, just like a newly-wed wife. Slaves took part in most of the civic and family cults; they were expressly invited to join the banquet of the "Choes", second day of the <a href="Anthesteria">Anthesteria</a>, and were allowed initiation into the <a href="Eleusinian%20Mysteries">Eleusinian Mysteries</a>. A slave could claim asylum in a temple or at an altar, just like a free man. The slaves shared the gods of their masters and could keep their own religious customs if any.

Slaves could not own property, but their masters often let them save up to purchase their freedom, and records survive of slaves operating businesses by themselves, making only a fixed tax-payment to their masters. Athens also had a law forbidding the striking of slaves: if a person struck what appeared to be a slave in Athens, that person might find himself hitting a fellow-citizen, because many citizens dressed no better. It astonished other Greeks that Athenians tolerated back-chat from slaves. Athenian slaves fought together with Athenian freemen at the <a href="battle%20of%20Marathon">battle of Marathon</a>, and the monuments memorialize them. It was formally decreed before the <a href="battle%20of%20Salamis">battle of Salamis</a> that the citizens should "save themselves, their women, children, and slaves".

Slaves had special sexual restrictions and obligations. For example, a slave could not engage free boys in <a href="Pederasty%20in%20ancient%20Greece">pederastic</a> relationships (""A slave shall not be the lover of a free boy nor follow after him, or else he shall receive fifty blows of the public lash.""), and they were forbidden from the <a href="palaestra">palaestra</a>e (""A slave shall not take exercise or anoint himself in the wrestling-schools.""). Both laws are attributed to Solon. Fathers wanting to protect their sons from unwanted advances provided them with a slave guard, called a "paidagogos", to escort the boy in his travels.

The sons of vanquished foes would be enslaved and often forced to work in male brothels, as in the case of <a href="Phaedo%20of%20Elis">Phaedo of Elis</a>, who at the request of <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a> was bought and freed from such an enterprise by the philosopher's rich friends. On the other hand, it is attested in sources that the rape of slaves was prosecuted, at least occasionally.

In <a href="Gortyn">Gortyn</a>, in Crete, according to a <a href="Gortyn%20code">code</a> engraved in stone dating to the 6th century BC, slaves ("doulos" or "oikeus") found themselves in a state of great dependence. Their children belonged to the master. The master was responsible for all their offences, and, inversely, he received amends for crimes committed against his slaves by others. In the Gortyn code, where all punishment was monetary, fines were doubled for slaves committing a misdemeanour or felony. Conversely, an offence committed against a slave was much less expensive than an offence committed against a free person. As an example, the rape of a free woman by a slave was punishable by a fine of 200 <a href="stater">stater</a>s (400 <a href="drachm">drachm</a>s), while the rape of a non-virgin slave by another slave brought a fine of only one obolus (a sixth of a drachm).

Slaves did have the right to possess a house and livestock, which could be transmitted to descendants, as could clothing and household furnishings. Their family was recognized by law: they could marry, divorce, write a testament and inherit just like free men.

Prior to its interdiction by <a href="Solon">Solon</a>, Athenians practiced debt enslavement: a citizen incapable of paying his debts became "enslaved" to the creditor. The exact nature of this dependency is a much controversial issue among modern historians: was it truly slavery or another form of bondage? However, this issue primarily concerned those peasants known as "hektēmoroi" working leased land belonging to rich landowners and unable to pay their rents. In theory, those so enslaved would be liberated when their original debts were repaid. The system was developed with variants throughout the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a> and is cited in the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>.
Solon put an end to it with the / "<a href="seisachtheia">seisachtheia</a>", liberation of debts, which prevented all claim to the person by the debtor and forbade the sale of free Athenians, including by themselves. <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> in his "<a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Athenians%20%28Aristotle%29">Constitution of the Athenians</a>" quotes one of Solon's poems: 
And many a man whom fraud or law had sold<br>
Far from his god-built land, an outcast slave,<br>
I brought again to Athens; yea, and some,<br>
Exiles from home through debt’s oppressive load,<br>
Speaking no more the dear Athenian tongue,<br>
But wandering far and wide, I brought again;<br>
And those that here in vilest slavery ("douleia")<br>
Crouched ‘neath a master’s ("despōtes") frown, I set them free. 
Though much of Solon's vocabulary is that of "traditional" slavery, servitude for debt was at least different in that the enslaved Athenian remained an Athenian, dependent on another Athenian, in his place of birth. It is this aspect which explains the great wave of discontent with slavery of the 6th century BC, which was not intended to free all slaves but only those enslaved by debt. The reforms of Solon left two exceptions: the guardian of an unmarried woman who had lost her virginity had the right to sell her as a slave, and a citizen could "expose" (abandon) unwanted newborn children.

The practice of <a href="manumission">manumission</a> is confirmed to have existed in <a href="Chios">Chios</a> from the 6th century BC. It probably dates back to an earlier period, as it was an oral procedure. Informal emancipations are also confirmed in the classical period. It was sufficient to have witnesses, who would escort the citizen to a public emancipation of his slave, either at the <a href="Theatre%20of%20Ancient%20Greece%23Theatre%20Structure%20and%20Layout">theatre</a> or before a public tribunal. This practice was outlawed in Athens in the middle of the 6th century BC to avoid public disorder.

The practice became more common in the 4th century BC and gave rise to inscriptions in stone which have been recovered from shrines such as <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a> and <a href="Dodona">Dodona</a>. They primarily date to the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, and the 1st century AD. Collective manumission was possible; an example is known from the 2nd century BC in the island of <a href="Thasos">Thasos</a>. It probably took place during a period of war as a reward for the slaves' loyalty, but in most cases the documentation deals with a voluntary act on the part of the master (predominantly male, but in the Hellenistic period also female).

The slave was often required to pay for himself an amount at least equivalent to his street value. To this end they could use their savings or take a so-called "friendly" loan ( / "eranos") from their master, a friend or a client like the <a href="hetaera">hetaera</a> <a href="Neaira%20%28hetaera%29">Neaira</a> did.

Emancipation was often of a religious nature, where the slave was considered to be "sold" to a deity, often Delphian <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>, or was consecrated after his emancipation. The temple would receive a portion of the monetary transaction and would guarantee the contract. The manumission could also be entirely civil, in which case the magistrate played the role of the deity.

The slave's freedom could be either total or partial, at the master's whim. In the former, the emancipated slave was legally protected against all attempts at re-enslavement—for instance, on the part of the former master's inheritors. In the latter case, the emancipated slave could be liable to a number of obligations to the former master. The most restrictive contract was the "paramone", a type of enslavement of limited duration during which time the master retained practically absolute rights.

In regard to the city, the emancipated slave was far from equal to a citizen by birth. He was liable to all types of obligations, as one can see from the proposals of <a href="Plato">Plato</a> in "The Laws": presentation three times monthly at the home of the former master, forbidden to become richer than him, etc. In fact, the status of emancipated slaves was similar to that of <a href="metic">metic</a>s, the residing foreigners, who were free but did not enjoy a citizen's rights.

<a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>n citizens used <a href="helot">helot</a>s, a dependent group collectively owned by the state. It is uncertain whether they had chattel slaves as well. There are mentions of people manumitted by Spartans, which was supposedly forbidden for helots, or sold outside of <a href="Lakonia">Lakonia</a>: the poet <a href="Alcman">Alcman</a>; a Philoxenos from Cytherea, reputedly enslaved with all his fellow citizens when his city was conquered, later sold to an Athenian; a Spartan cook bought by <a href="Dionysius%20the%20Elder">Dionysius the Elder</a> or by a king of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Pontus">Pontus</a>, both versions being mentioned by Plutarch; and the famous Spartan nurses, much appreciated by Athenian parents.

Some texts mention both slaves and helots, which seems to indicate that they were not the same thing. <a href="Plato">Plato</a> in "<a href="Alcibiades%20I">Alcibiades I</a>" cites "the ownership of slaves, and notably helots" among the Spartan riches, and Plutarch writes about "slaves and helots". Finally, according to Thucydides, the agreement that ended the 464 BC revolt of helots stated that any Messenian rebel who might hereafter be found within the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a> was "to be the slave of his captor", which means that the ownership of chattel slaves was not illegal at that time.

Most historians thus concur that chattel slaves were indeed used in the Greek city-state of Sparta, at least after the Lacedemonian victory of 404 BC against Athens, but not in great numbers and only among the upper classes. As was in the other Greek cities, chattel slaves could be purchased at the market or taken in war.

It is difficult to appreciate the condition of Greek slaves. According to <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, the daily routine of slaves could be summed up in three words: "work, discipline, and feeding". Xenophon's advice is to treat slaves as domestic animals, that is to say punish disobedience and reward good behaviour. For his part, Aristotle prefers to see slaves treated as children and to use not only orders but also recommendations, as the slave is capable of understanding reasons when they are explained.

Greek literature abounds with scenes of slaves being flogged; it was a means of forcing them to work, as were control of rations, clothing, and rest. This violence could be meted out by the master or the supervisor, who was possibly also a slave. Thus, at the beginning of <a href="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a>' "<a href="The%20Knights">The Knights</a>" (4–5), two slaves complain of being "bruised and thrashed without respite" by their new supervisor. However, Aristophanes himself cites what is a typical old saw in <a href="ancient%20Greek%20comedy">ancient Greek comedy</a>:

"He also dismissed those slaves who kept on running off, or deceiving someone, or getting whipped. They were always led out crying, so one of their fellow slaves could mock the bruises and ask then: 'Oh you poor miserable fellow, what's happened to your skin? Surely a huge army of lashes from a whip has fallen down on you and laid waste your back?'"
The condition of slaves varied very much according to their status; the mine slaves of Laureion and the "<a href="prostitution%20in%20ancient%20Greece">pornai</a>" (brothel prostitutes) lived a particularly brutal existence, while public slaves, craftsmen, tradesmen and bankers enjoyed relative independence. In return for a fee ( / "apophora") paid to their master, they could live and work alone. They could thus earn some money on the side, sometimes enough to purchase their freedom. Potential emancipation was indeed a powerful motivator, though the real scale of this is difficult to estimate.

Ancient writers considered that Attic slaves enjoyed a "peculiarly happy lot": <a href="Pseudo-Xenophon">Pseudo-Xenophon</a> deplores the liberties taken by Athenian slaves: "as for the slaves and Metics of Athens, they take the greatest licence; you cannot just strike them, and they do not step aside to give you free passage". This alleged good treatment did not prevent 20,000 Athenian slaves from running away at the end of the <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian War</a> at the incitement of the Spartan garrison at <a href="Attica">Attica</a> in <a href="Decelea">Decelea</a>. These were principally skilled artisans ("kheirotekhnai"), probably among the better-treated slaves. The title of a 4th-century comedy by <a href="Antiphanes%20%28comic%20poet%29">Antiphanes</a>, "The Runaway-catcher" (), suggests that slave flight was not uncommon.

Conversely, there are no records of a large-scale Greek slave revolt comparable to that of <a href="Spartacus">Spartacus</a> in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. It can probably be explained by the relative dispersion of Greek slaves, which would have prevented any large-scale planning. Slave revolts were rare, even in Rome. Individual acts of rebellion of slaves against their master, though scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech mentions the attempted murder of his master by a boy slave, not 12 years old.

Very few authors of antiquity call slavery into question. To <a href="Homer">Homer</a> and the pre-classical authors, slavery was an inevitable consequence of war. <a href="Heraclitus">Heraclitus</a> states that "War is the father of all, the king of all ... he turns some into slaves and sets others free". Aristotle also felt this way, stating "the law by which whatever is taken in war is supposed to belong to the victors." He does also state that it might have a few issues though,”For what if the cause of war be unjust?” If the war was because of an unfair or incorrect reason, should the victors of that war be allowed to take the losers as slaves?

During the classical period the main justification for slavery was economic. From a philosophical point of view, the idea of "natural" slavery emerged at the same time; thus, as <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a> states in "<a href="The%20Persians">The Persians</a>", the Greeks "[o]f no man are they called the slaves or vassals", while the <a href="Persian%20people">Persians</a>, as <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a> states in "<a href="Helen%20%28play%29">Helen</a>", "are all slaves, except one"—the <a href="Great%20King">Great King</a>. <a href="Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a> theorizes about this latent idea at the end of the 5th century BC. According to him, the temperate climate of <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> produced a placid and submissive people. This explanation is reprised by <a href="Plato">Plato</a>, then <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> in "<a href="Politics%20%28Aristotle%29">Politics</a>", where he develops the concept of "natural slavery": "for he that can foresee with his mind is naturally ruler and naturally master, and he that can do these things with his body is subject and naturally a slave." As opposed to an animal, a slave can comprehend reason but "…has not got the deliberative part at all."

<a href="Alcidamas">Alcidamas</a>, at the same time as Aristotle, took the opposite view, saying: ""nature" has made "nobody" a slave".

In parallel, the concept that all men, whether Greek or barbarian, belonged to the same race was being developed by the <a href="sophism">Sophists</a> and thus that certain men were slaves although they had the soul of a freeman and vice versa. Aristotle himself recognized this possibility and argued that slavery could not be imposed unless the master was better than the slave, in keeping with his theory of "natural" slavery. The Sophists concluded that true servitude was not a matter of status but a matter of spirit; thus, as <a href="Menander">Menander</a> stated, "be free in the mind, although you are slave: and thus you will no longer be a slave". This idea, repeated by the <a href="stoicism">Stoics</a> and the <a href="Epicurianism">Epicurians</a>, was not so much an opposition to slavery as a trivialization of it.
The Greeks could not comprehend an absence of slaves. Slaves exist even in the "<a href="wiktionary%3ACloudcuckooland">Cloudcuckooland</a>" of Aristophanes' "<a href="The%20Birds%20%28play%29">The Birds</a>" as well as in the ideal cities of Plato's "Laws" or "Republic". The utopian cities of <a href="Phaleas%20of%20Chalcedon">Phaleas of Chalcedon</a> and <a href="Hippodamus%20of%20Miletus">Hippodamus of Miletus</a> are based on the equal distribution of property, but public slaves are used respectively as craftsmen and land workers. The "reversed cities" placed women in power or even saw the end of private property, as in "<a href="Lysistrata">Lysistrata</a>" or "<a href="Assemblywomen">Assemblywomen</a>", but could not picture slaves in charge of masters. The only societies without slaves were those of the <a href="Golden%20Age">Golden Age</a>, where all needs were met without anyone having to work. In this type of society, as explained by Plato, one reaped generously without sowing. In Telekleides' "Amphictyons" barley loaves fight with wheat loaves for the honor of being eaten by men. Moreover, objects move themselves—dough kneads itself, and the jug pours itself. Similarly, Aristotle said that slaves would not be necessary "if every instrument could accomplish its own work... the shuttle would weave and the plectrum touch the lyre without a hand to guide them", like the legendary constructs of Daedalus and Hephaestus. Society without slaves is thus relegated to a different time and space. In a "normal" society, one needs slaves. Aristotle argues that slaves are a necessity though, saying "Property is part of the household, ... For no man can live well or indeed live at all, unless he be provided with necessaries." He also argues that slaves are the most important part of the property as they "take precedence of all the instruments." This would suggest that at least some slaves would be treated well for the same reason one would take great care of their most important tools. By viewing slaves as tools of a household, it creates another reason for acceptance of slavery. Aristotle says "indeed the use of slaves and of tame animals is not very different," showing as well that at least in part, some slaves were thought of no higher than the common tamed animals in use at the time. Antiphon viewed slaves as a bit more than common animals or tools. On the topic of a man killing his own slave, he says that the man should "purify himself and withhold himself from those places prescribed by law, in the hope that by doing so he will best avoid disaster." This suggests that there still is some sense of inappropriateness in killing a slave, even one owned by the killer.

Punishment of slaves would have been swift and harsh. Demosthenes viewed punishment for slaves as acceptable in the form of physical harm or injuries for all that they may have done wrong, stating "the body of a slave is made responsible for all his misdeeds, whereas corporal punishment is the last penalty to inflict on a free man." This was spoken about in legal proceedings, suggesting that it would have been a widely accepted way of treating slaves.

Slavery in Greek antiquity has long been an object of <a href="apologetics">apologetic</a> discourse among Christians, who are typically awarded the merit of its collapse. From the 16th century the discourse became moralizing in nature. The existence of <a href="colonialism">colonial</a> slavery had significant impact on the debate, with some authors lending it civilizing merits and others denouncing its misdeeds. Thus <a href="Henri-Alexandre%20Wallon">Henri-Alexandre Wallon</a> in 1847 published a "History of Slavery in Antiquity" among his works for the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20France">abolition of slavery</a> in the <a href="French%20colonial%20empires">French colonies</a>.

In the 19th century, a politico-economic discourse emerged. It concerned itself with distinguishing the phases in the organisation of human societies and correctly identifying the place of Greek slavery. The influence of <a href="Marx">Marx</a> is decisive; for him the ancient society was characterized by development of private ownership and the dominant (and not secondary as in other pre-capitalist societies) character of slavery as a <a href="mode%20of%20production">mode of production</a>. The <a href="positivism">Positivists</a> represented by the historian <a href="Eduard%20Meyer">Eduard Meyer</a> ("Slavery in Antiquity", 1898) were soon to oppose the <a href="Marxism">Marxist</a> theory. According to him slavery was the foundation of Greek democracy. It was thus a legal and social phenomenon, and not economic.

Current historiography developed in the 20th century; led by authors such as Joseph Vogt, it saw in slavery the conditions for the development of elites. Conversely, the theory also demonstrates an opportunity for slaves to join the elite. Finally, Vogt estimates that modern society, founded on humanist values, has surpassed this level of development.
In 2011, Greek slavery remains the subject of historiographical debate, on two questions in particular: can it be said that ancient Greece was a "slave society", and did Greek slaves comprise a <a href="social%20class">social class</a>?

Jeannette Expedition

The Jeannette Expedition of 1879–1881, officially called the U.S. Arctic Expedition, was an attempt led by <a href="George%20W.%20De%20Long">George W. De Long</a> to reach the <a href="North%20Pole">North Pole</a> by pioneering a route from the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> through the <a href="Bering%20Strait">Bering Strait</a>. The premise was that a temperate current, the <a href="Kuroshio%20Current">Kuro Siwo</a>, flowed northwards into the strait, providing a gateway to the <a href="Open%20Polar%20Sea">Open Polar Sea</a> and thus to the pole. 

This theory proved illusory; the expedition's ship, and its crew of 33, was trapped by ice and drifted for nearly two years before she was crushed and sunk, north of the <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>n coast. De Long then led his 32 men on a perilous journey by sled, dragging the "Jeannette" <a href="whaleboat">whaleboat</a> and two <a href="Cutter%20%28boat%29">cutters</a>, eventually switching to these small boats to sail for the <a href="Lena%20Delta">Lena Delta</a> in Siberia. During this journey, and in the subsequent weeks of wandering in Siberia before rescue, 20 of the ship's complement died, including De Long.

The chief exponent of the theory of a warm-water gateway to the North Pole was the German cartographer <a href="August%20Petermann">August Petermann</a>. He encouraged <a href="James%20Gordon%20Bennett%20Jr.">James Gordon Bennett Jr.</a>, the proprietor of the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald">New York Herald</a>", to finance a polar expedition based on the untried Pacific route. Bennett acquired a former <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a>, the "Pandora", and changed her name to "Jeannette". De Long, whom Bennett chose to lead the expedition, was a serving naval officer with previous Arctic experience. Although essentially a private venture, in which Bennett paid all the bills, the expedition had the full support of the U.S. Government. Before departure the ship was commissioned into the U.S. Navy as USS "Jeannette", and sailed under navy laws and discipline.

Before its demise, the expedition discovered new islands—the <a href="De%20Long%20Islands">De Long Islands</a>—and collected valuable meteorological and oceanographic data. Although "Jeannette"s fate demolished the widely believed Open Polar Sea theory, the appearance in 1884 of debris from the wreck on the south-west coast of Greenland indicated the existence of an ocean current moving the permanent Arctic ice from east to west. This discovery inspired <a href="Fridtjof%20Nansen">Fridtjof Nansen</a> to mount his <a href="Nansen%27s%20Fram%20expedition">"Fram" expedition</a> nine years later. A monument to the "Jeannette"s dead was erected at the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> in <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis</a>, in 1890.

European exploration of the Arctic regions began in the 16th century, with searches for new routes to the Pacific via the <a href="Northeast%20Passage">Northeast</a> and <a href="Northwest%20Passage">Northwest</a> passages. The English sea explorer <a href="Henry%20Hudson">Henry Hudson</a>, namesake of the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a>, is presumed to have died in <a href="Hudson%20Bay">Hudson Bay</a> in 1611 while trying to find the Northwest Passage. The possibility of a third route, directly across the <a href="North%20Pole">North Pole</a>, was raised by early geographer <a href="Richard%20Hakluyt">Richard Hakluyt</a>. The early explorers had little success in finding these routes, but made important geographical discoveries. In time, the search for trade routes became secondary to the prestige objective of reaching the North Pole itself, or at least of registering a "<a href="Farthest%20North">Farthest North</a>". In 1773, a British naval expedition under captain <a href="Constantine%20Phipps%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Mulgrave">Constantine Phipps</a> sought a route to the pole from the <a href="Sju%C3%B8yane">Seven Islands</a>, but found the way impassably blocked by ice. On , whaling captain <a href="William%20Scoresby">William Scoresby</a> achieved a new record northern latitude of 81°30' to the north of <a href="Svalbard">Svalbard</a> before being stopped by ice.

The prevalent theory of polar geography throughout this period was that of a temperate "<a href="Open%20Polar%20Sea">Open Polar Sea</a>" surrounding the North Pole. The observable southward drift of Arctic ice was thought to result from the "pushing" effect of this warmer water. According to the historian <a href="Hampton%20Sides">Hampton Sides</a>, despite the lack of scientific evidence the theory "gathered a logic of its own ... No amount of contrary evidence could dislodge it from the collective imagination". The fact that all northbound voyages had, sooner or later, been stopped by ice was rationalized through a belief that the undiscovered sea was encircled in a ring or "annulus" of ice which, it was thought, could be penetrated via one of several warm-water gateways or portals. The initial quest for the North Pole thus became a search for one of these portals.

After British naval expeditions in 1818 and had probed north of <a href="Spitsbergen">Spitsbergen</a> and found no sign of the supposed polar sea, the quest was in abeyance for 25 years. In the 1850s, the search for the <a href="Franklin%27s%20lost%20expedition">lost Franklin expedition</a> generated a rash of incursions into the Canadian Arctic. From these forays, particularly that of <a href="Edward%20Augustus%20Inglefield">Edward Augustus Inglefield</a> in 1852, emerged the theory that <a href="Smith%20Sound">Smith Sound</a>, a northerly channel between Greenland and <a href="Ellesmere%20Island">Ellesmere Island</a>, might be one of the fabled gateways to the Polar Sea. This brought a succession of expeditions to this area: <a href="Elisha%20Kane">Elisha Kane</a> in , <a href="Isaac%20Israel%20Hayes">Isaac Israel Hayes</a> in , <a href="Charles%20Francis%20Hall">Charles Francis Hall</a> in , and <a href="George%20Nares">George Nares</a> in . No gateway was found, although both Kane and Hayes claimed, mistakenly, to have seen the Open Polar Sea from a distance.

The Smith Sound route was not favored by everyone; among those who rejected it was leading cartographer <a href="August%20Petermann">August Petermann</a>, from <a href="Gotha">Gotha</a> in Germany, widely known as the "Sage of Gotha". A firm believer in the Open Polar Sea theory, he believed that the most likely portal would be found by following the <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a>, which swept up the coast of Norway to the unexplored Arctic regions. Peterman thought the current would weaken or even penetrate the protective ice ring, and that a sturdily-built steamer following the course of the stream might thus be able to break through into the supposed polar sea.

After two expeditions sponsored by Petermann—the <a href="German%20North%20Polar%20Expedition">German North Polar Expedition</a> of 1869 led by <a href="Carl%20Koldewey">Carl Koldewey</a>, and the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20North%20Pole%20Expedition">Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition</a> of 1872 under <a href="Karl%20Weyprecht">Karl Weyprecht</a> and <a href="Julius%20von%20Payer">Julius von Payer</a>—had followed separate branches of the Gulf Stream but ultimately failed to break through the ice, Petermann grew dispirited. In the year before he took his own life in 1878 he transferred his advocacy to the <a href="Kuroshio%20Current">Kuro Siwo</a>, a Pacific Ocean current analyzed in the 1850s by the hydrographer <a href="Silas%20Bent%20%28naval%20officer%29">Silas Bent</a>. Petermann followed Bent in believing that a branch of the Kuro Siwo flowed through the <a href="Bering%20Strait">Bering Strait</a>, and might be powerful enough to create a path to the polar sea. At the time no one had attempted to reach the polar sea by this route.

In July 1873 the U.S. Navy dispatched to Greenland, to search for survivors from the <a href="Polaris%20expedition">"Polaris" expedition</a> which had disintegrated after the death of its leader, Charles Francis Hall. "Juniata"s second-in-command was <a href="George%20W.%20De%20Long">George W. De Long</a>, a 28-year-old graduate of the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a>, making his first visit to the Arctic. Ice conditions prevented "Juniata" from advancing beyond <a href="Upernavik">Upernavik</a>; De Long volunteered to take the <a href="ship%27s%20tender">ship's tender</a>, a small steamer named the "Little Juniata", in the hope of finding survivors at <a href="Cape%20York%20%28Greenland%29">Cape York</a>, a further north.

The attempt failed; "Little Juniata" faced extreme weather conditions, and was forced to retreat a few miles from Cape York. De Long returned to "Juniata" in mid-August, having found no trace of the "Polaris" crew—who had meanwhile been rescued by the Scottish whaler —but the experience had profoundly affected his outlook. Having earlier described the Greenland coast in a letter to his wife Emma as "a dreary land of desolation ... I hope I may never find myself cast away in such a perfectly God-forsaken place", he returned home captivated by the Arctic. Emma wrote: "The polar virus was in his blood and would not let him rest".

The abortive "Little Juniata" mission brought De Long to public notice, and he saw himself as a possible leader of the next U.S. Arctic expedition. He approached <a href="Henry%20Grinnell">Henry Grinnell</a>, the philanthropic shipping magnate who had funded several previous expeditions. Grinnell was not prepared to offer financial support, instead advising De Long to approach <a href="James%20Gordon%20Bennett%20Jr.">James Gordon Bennett Jr.</a>, owner and publisher of the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald">New York Herald</a>" and a known sponsor of bold schemes. De Long met Bennett in New York early in 1874; the newspaperman was impressed by De Long, and assured him that his Arctic ambitions would have the enthusiastic support of the "Herald". In the meantime De Long had applied to the Navy Department for an Arctic command, a request that he was informed would "receive due attention".

James Gordon Bennett Jr., had succeeded <a href="James%20Gordon%20Bennett%20Sr.">his father</a> as proprietor of the "New York Herald" in 1866. He had won renown in 1872, when his reporter <a href="Henry%20Morton%20Stanley">Henry Morton Stanley</a>, sent by Bennett to Africa in search of the British missionary-explorer <a href="David%20Livingstone">David Livingstone</a>, cabled that Livingstone had been found. Bennett knew the news value of Arctic exploration; two "Herald " reporters had accompanied "Juniata", and in 1874 Bennett was helping to fund British sailor <a href="Allen%20Young">Allen Young</a> and his decommissioned former <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a> "Pandora", on one of the final Franklin searches.

Bennett was interested in Petermann's theories, and in 1877 traveled to Gotha to discuss possible Arctic routes with the geographer. Petermann thought that as well as providing the best path to the pole, passage through the Bering Strait using the Kuro Siwo would enable investigation of the unexplored, barely glimpsed land mass known since 1867 as "<a href="Wrangel%20Island">Wrangel's Land</a>". He theorized that this land might form part of a transpolar continent, connected to Greenland; if so, it might provide an alternative, land-based route to the pole should the expedition fail to find a portal to the polar sea. "My idea", he told Bennett, "is that if one door will not open, try another". He offered Bennett full use of his maps and charts.

Petermann's advice convinced Bennett that a new American polar venture should go ahead. On his return from Gotha, he cabled De Long requesting him to seek leave of absence from the Navy, and to begin the search for a ship suitable for Arctic exploration using Petermann's Bering Strait route.

As no suitable ship was available in the United States, De Long went to England, where he found Young's "Pandora" on offer at $6,000. The vessel's Arctic pedigree made it seem ideal, but Young's hesitancy about selling delayed the purchase until late 1877. At Bennett's instigation, Congress passed legislation that gave the <a href="Navy%20Department">Navy Department</a> full control over the expedition; it would fly the American flag, the crew would be engaged by the navy, and would be subject to naval discipline. Bennett remained responsible for financing the enterprise, and undertook to reimburse the government for all costs incurred. Meanwhile, De Long was released from active duty, to oversee "Pandora's" refit in England.

In June 1878, after a thorough overhaul at <a href="Deptford">Deptford</a> on the <a href="Thames%20Estuary">Thames Estuary</a>, "Pandora" was sailed to <a href="Le%20Havre">Le Havre</a> in France where, on July 4, she was renamed "Jeannette", after Bennett's sister who performed the ceremony. On July 15 the ship, manned by De Long and a small crew, sailed from Le Havre to begin the voyage to <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, the port from which the Arctic expedition was to sail. They arrived on December 27, 1878, and transferred "Jeannette" to <a href="Mare%20Island%20Naval%20Shipyard">Mare Island Naval Shipyard</a> to undergo further work in readiness for a prolonged journey in the Arctic ice.

De Long spent much of the early part of 1879 in Washington, D.C., promoting the expedition among officials, searching for appropriate crew members, and harrying Navy Secretary <a href="Richard%20W.%20Thompson">Richard W. Thompson</a> for practical support. His requests included the use of a supply ship to accompany "Jeannette" as far as Alaska. Among the less standard equipment acquired by De Long was an experimental <a href="arc%20lamp">arc lamp</a> system devised by <a href="Thomas%20Edison">Thomas Edison</a>, which would supposedly provide light equivalent to 3,000 candles and thus transform the Arctic winter darkness. Having successfully undergone her sea trials, on June 28, ten days before her scheduled departure, "Jeannette" was formally commissioned into the U.S. Navy as USS "Jeannette".

In selecting his crew, De Long's priority was men with Arctic experience. For his second-in-command he chose lieutenant <a href="Charles%20W.%20Chipp">Charles W. Chipp</a>, who had served with him on the "Little Juniata" adventure. Another veteran of the <a href="Polaris%20expedition">"Polaris"</a> rescue mission, <a href="George%20W.%20Melville">George W. Melville</a>, was appointed as ship's engineer. Other experienced Arctic hands were <a href="William%20F.%20C.%20Nindemann">William F. C. Nindemann</a>, a "Polaris" survivor, and the ice pilot William Dunbar, who had many years' experience in whalers.

The appointment of the expedition's navigating officer was problematic; <a href="John%20W.%20Danenhower">John W. Danenhower</a>, a young naval officer from a well-connected Washington family, was recommended to Bennett by the former president <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>. Such sponsorship won Danenhower his place, despite a history of depression that had seen him briefly incarcerated at the <a href="St.%20Elizabeths%20Hospital">Government Hospital for the Insane</a>. On Bennett's request, Danenhower accompanied De Long on the voyage from Le Havre to San Francisco, during which he confided details of his medical history. The navigator's competent performance persuaded De Long that such troubles were in the past.

The ship's surgeon, James Ambler, was assigned to the expedition by the Navy's <a href="Bureau%20of%20Medicine%20and%20Surgery">Bureau of Medicine and Surgery</a>, only because he was next on the list of medical officers available for sea duty. Ambler deduced from Danenhower's medical records that a probable cause of the navigator's medical lapses was <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>, but Danenhower's influential connections ensured that he kept his place on the expedition.

Two others from "Jeannette"s voyage from <a href="Le%20Havre">Le Havre</a>, carpenter Albert Sweetman and <a href="boatswain">boatswain</a> John Cole, were enlisted, as was the "Herald"s meteorologist, Jerome Collins. Dubbed "chief scientist," he was in charge of the Edison apparatus and of a rudimentary telephone system that De Long hoped to utilize. The remaining places were filled from a long list of applicants; the cook and steward were recruited by Danenhower from San Francisco's <a href="Chinatown%2C%20San%20Francisco">Chinatown</a>.

De Long quickly found himself at odds with the naval engineers at Mare Island, whose estimates of the work required to prepare "Jeannette" for the Arctic greatly exceeded his own judgement of what was necessary. De Long spent much time negotiating on Bennett's behalf with the Navy Department, in an effort to reduce costs. In this he was broadly successful, but in other areas he faced setbacks. In April he learned that the navy was unable to provide a supply ship to accompany "Jeannette" northward, a decision which, he thought, left the fate of the expedition "hanging by a thread". Bennett eventually resolved this difficulty by chartering a <a href="schooner">schooner</a>, the "Frances Hyde", to carry extra coal and provisions as far as Alaska.

Late in his preparations, De Long received orders from Secretary Thompson that, before proceeding with his own Arctic mission he should enquire along the Siberian coast for news of <a href="Adolf%20Erik%20Nordenski%C3%B6ld">Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld</a> and his ship <a href="SS%20Vega%20%281872%29">"Vega"</a>. The Swedish explorer was currently attempting the first navigation of the Northeast passage; he was not overdue, and there was no evidence that he was in difficulty. Nevertheless, Bennett sensed the opportunity for a rescue story to equal his Stanley-Livingstone scoop, and persuaded Thompson to issue the order. De Long, unaware that his patron was the originator, protested that this requirement would jeopardize his primary mission, but was forced to modify his plans.

De Long was unaware, as he prepared to sail, that the <a href="U.S.%20National%20Geodetic%20Survey">U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey</a> was studying the latest hydrographical and meteorological data obtained from its research ships in the Bering Sea. The material indicated conclusively that, contrary to Bent's theories, the Kuro Siwo had no perceptible effect on the areas north of the Bering Strait. The survey's report went on to dismiss the entire concept of "gateways" and the warm polar sea. By the time these conclusions were published, "Jeannette" had sailed, and De Long remained in ignorance of this information.

"Jeannette's" departure from San Francisco, on July 8, 1879, was a popular spectacle, witnessed by large crowds who came from all quarters of the city. The army at <a href="Fort%20Point%2C%20San%20Francisco">Fort Point</a> provided an eleven-gun salute; in contrast, De Long noted that none of the naval vessels in and around San Francisco made any formal acknowledgement of their sister-ship's departure, "[not even] the blast of a steam whistle". Bennett, absent in Europe, cabled that he hoped to be present when "Jeannette" made its triumphant return.

The first weeks on the journey northwards were uneventful. On August 3 "Jeannette" reached <a href="Unalaska%2C%20Alaska">Unalaska</a> in the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>, where De Long sought information on Nordenskiöld from the crew of a <a href="United%20States%20Revenue%20Cutter%20Service">revenue cutter</a>, newly returned from the Bering Strait. The cutter had no news of him. On August 12, "Jeannette" reached <a href="St.%20Michael%2C%20Alaska">St. Michael</a>, a small port on the Alaskan mainland, and waited for the "Francis Hyde" to arrive with extra provisions and coal.

At St Michael, De Long hired two experienced <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a> dog drivers, and took on board a number of <a href="sled%20dogs">sled dogs</a>. On August 21, after transferring provisions and fuel, "Francis Hyde" departed; "Jeannette" set out for the <a href="Chukchi%20Peninsula">Chukchi Peninsula</a> on the Siberian coast, to enquire after Nordenskiöld. At <a href="Saint%20Lawrence%20Bay%2C%20Chukotka">Saint Lawrence Bay</a> the <a href="Chukchi%20people">Chukchi people</a> reported that an unidentified steamer had recently passed by, going south. De Long then headed through the Bering Strait towards <a href="Cape%20Dezhnev">Cape Dezhnev</a>, where he learned from locals that a ship had called at <a href="Cape%20Serdtse-Kamen">Cape Serdtse-Kamen</a>, further along the coast. Here, a shore party from "Jeannette" quickly established from artifacts left behind with villagers that this ship was "Vega" and that Nordenskiöld's expedition had therefore safely completed the Northeast passage. De Long left a note of his findings for transmission to Washington. On August 31 "Jeannette" left, in the assumed direction of Wrangel's Land, where De Long hoped to establish his winter quarters.

"Jeannette" initially made good speed northward; on September 2 she was about from the charted position of Wrangel's Land, but with ice thickening all around, movement became slow and erratic. On September 4, from the crow's nest, Dunbar sighted the known landmark of <a href="Herald%20Island%20%28Arctic%29">Herald Island</a>, but the ice now presented an almost insuperable obstacle to progress. De Long raised steam and repeatedly charged the pack, seeking to batter a way forward. The thick plume of smoke from "Jeannette's" stack, observed by whalers, was the final sighting of "Jeannette" by the outside world.

The next day, September 5, the crew caught a brief glimpse of Wrangel's Land—or perhaps, as De Long surmised, a mirage. Ice conditions now made it impossible to move closer to this tantalizing shore, and De Long made Herald Island his new objective. Shortly afterwards, "Jeannette" was sealed within the pack, "as tightly as a fly in amber" according to historian Leonard Guttridge.

Herald Island was still about away; a sled party under Chipp set off across the ice, to investigate the possibility of a winter harbor should the ship regain maneuverability. Chipp's party was unable to get closer to the island than , before the volatile ice conditions forced their return to the ship. De Long still hoped for a change in the weather that would release them from the ice, writing in his journal: "I am told that in the later part of September and early part of October there is experienced in these latitudes quite an Indian Summer". The following weeks brought no increase in temperature, and De Long reluctantly accepted that "Jeannette" was trapped for the winter.

The initial direction of the ship's drift was haphazard, back and forth—on October 13, nearly a month after "Jeannette" was first trapped, Herald Island was still in sight. As October developed, the direction of drift shifted to the northwest, and it became apparent to De Long that "Wrangel's Land" was not after all a land mass, but was a relatively small island. At the same time, analyses of sea currents, salinity and temperature provided data confirming the Geodetic Survey's findings, by then known in Washington, that the Kuro Siwo had no effect north of the Bering Strait. The vista of endless ice surrounding the ship raised profound doubts about the entire concept of the Open Polar Sea. Amid the boredom of the largely eventless drift, the crew ate well; ship's stores were boosted by regular hunting parties which brought a harvest of seal and polar bear meat.
In late October, as winter approached, De Long ordered the Edison arc lighting system erected, but the generating mechanism failed to produce even the dimmest of lights, and the apparatus was swiftly abandoned, along with the equally ineffective telephone system. Christmas 1879, and the start of the new year, were celebrated without great joy; De Long wrote of Christmas as "the dreariest day of my life, and it is certainly the dreariest part of the world".

On , "Jeannette"s hull was breached by the ice, and she began to take in water rapidly. De Long prepared to abandon ship, but she was saved by the actions of Nindemann and Sweetman, who waded into the freezing water in the hold and staunched the inflow by stuffing whatever materials were available into the breaches. Melville used elements of the discarded Edison apparatus to build a mechanical pumping system, and the problem was largely resolved by the construction of a new watertight bulkhead. De Long noted in his journal that the efforts of Nindemann and Sweetman were at least worthy of recommendation for the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a>.

For months on end "Jeannette" hardly moved at all; De Long recorded on March 2 that their position was almost precisely what it had been three months earlier. On May 5, the ship passed to the west of the 180° meridian, but two months later had retreated back to the other side of the line. The summer brought no relief; although it briefly seemed possible in August that "Jeannette" might break free and find open water, this proved a false hope. The condition of Danenhower was a further source of anxiety. His syphilis began to take toll of his body, particularly his left eye which, despite Ambler's repeated operations—stoically endured, given the lack of anesthetic—left the navigator largely incapacitated and unable to perform his duties. On the last day of 1880 De Long wrote in his journal: "I begin the new year by turning over a new leaf, and I hope to God we are turning over a new leaf in our book of luck".

Early in 1881, De Long noted that after 16 months "Jeannette" was still only from the point where she had been trapped. He wrote: "We are drifting about like a modern "Flying Dutchman" ... thirty-three people are wearing out their lives and souls". On May 16 an island was sighted, followed almost immediately by another—the first land seen for well over a year. "There is something then beside ice in the world!", wrote De Long. They were in uncharted seas, so these islands were discoveries. De Long named the first "Henrietta Island", after Bennett's mother, and the second "Jeannette Island". A sledge party under Melville was despatched to Henrietta Island, to claim the territories for the United States.

At around this time, the was in Alaskan waters, seeking news of De Long's expedition. "Corwin"s captain Calvin Hooper heard stories of a shipwreck in the far north, and set off to investigate. For five weeks he circled the Bering Sea; encounters with locals convinced him that the wreck was not that of "Jeannette". On , another relief vessel, left San Francisco, but was destroyed by fire in Saint Lawrence Bay in November.

On board "Jeannette", the discovery of the islands had raised De Long's spirits—the expedition would, wherever the drift took it, have some concrete geographical achievement to its credit. The onset of the brief Arctic summer brought fresh hopes that "Jeannette" would at last be released from the ice, and on June 11 she was briefly free, afloat in a small pool. However, the next day the ice returned with renewed force, which battered the ship and finally penetrated the hull beyond repair. De Long supervised an orderly evacuation of men, dogs, equipment and provisions. On the evening of , "Jeannette" sank, her final recorded position being , around off the Siberian coast.

The entire crew of 33 was still together. De Long's general plan was to march with dogs and sleds to the <a href="New%20Siberian%20Islands">New Siberian Islands</a>, somewhere to the south, and then use the boats to carry his party to the Siberian mainland. According to Petermann's maps his intended landfall, the <a href="Lena%20Delta">Lena Delta</a>, was studded with settlements that would provide them with shelter and safety. By June 25, after a week's hard traveling on the ice, the northward drift had nullified their progress; they were further from land than they had been when they set out.

When the direction of the ice shifted, the party was finally able to advance in the right direction, but the going was slow and difficult. Part of the problem lay with the dogs who, after nearly two years of relative idleness, were either lethargic or quarrelsome, unable to work in harness. Some of the worst offenders were shot for food. 

On July 12, land appeared to the south; fleetingly, De Long thought this was part of the New Siberian Islands, but it was another uncharted island. When the party reached it on July 29, De Long named it <a href="Bennett%20Island">Bennett Island</a>, and called the point of landing "Cape Emma", after his wife. Meanwhile, hundreds of miles to the east, the "Corwin" had given up on its rescue mission. After months of searching vainly for definite news or traces of "Jeannette", Hooper had concluded that the vessel was lost, and headed back to San Francisco.

After a week's rest, the party departed Bennett Island on August 6, leaving a message in a rock cairn. The ice was now too loose for sled travel, so the party transferred to the boats. Having no further use for the dogs, De Long ordered them shot. The general direction of the ice flow carried the party south-west, and on August 20 the most easterly of the New Siberian Islands, <a href="New%20Siberia">Novaya Sibir</a>, was in sight. For the first time since moving away from Herald Island nearly two years previously, they were in the charted world. De Long steered the boats through the channel between Novaya Sibir and <a href="Kotelny%20Island">Kotelny Island</a>, before skirting the southern coast of Kotelny and beginning the final stage of the journey, across the open sea to the Lena Delta. Their last halt, on September 10, was on the tiny <a href="Semyonovsky%20Island">Semyonovsky Island</a>, fewer than from the Siberian coast.

The entire crew of 33 was still together on Semenovsky Island. The boats left the island early in the morning of September 12, in fair weather. Thirteen men were with De Long in the large <a href="Cutter%20%28boat%29">cutter</a>, Chipp with seven others took the smaller cutter, while Melville and ten men sailed in the <a href="whaleboat">whaleboat</a>. Danenhower, who outranked Melville, complained bitterly to De Long about being placed under the engineer's command, but De Long replied that Danenhower was unfit for duty, a view confirmed by Ambler. De Long instructed that the boats should each aim for a point indicated as "Cape Barkin" on the Petermann map; if they became separated, and landed in different areas, the parties should rendezvous at Bulun, a sizeable settlement about from the coast.

The boats made good progress through the morning, and Melville initially thought they might strike land after a single night at sea. In the afternoon the weather worsened; the boats separated and lost sight of each other. De Long used a <a href="sea%20anchor">sea anchor</a> to stabilize his craft in the ferocious seas, and despite having his sail torn away by the wind, managed to hold a course to the west. The storm had largely subsided by the morning of September 14, but progress was erratic in the absence of the sail, and it was three more days before the cutter ran aground at the most northerly limit of the Lena Delta. De Long and his crew waded ashore, carrying their provisions from the boat, and prepared for a long foot journey. Based on their map, the nearest settlement appeared to lie away. De Long thought their rations would last for three-and-a-half days.

In the whaleboat, Melville had, like De Long, ridden out the storm by means of a sea anchor. The boat's course was far to the south of De Long's; they finally reached land at one of the main mouths of the Lena, and were able to navigate upriver. Within a few days they encountered a native fishing camp, and by September 25 had reached the settlement of Arrhu. Chipp's cutter never reached land; overwhelmed by the storm, it presumably foundered, with the loss of all eight on board.

The De Long party found no immediate sign at their landing-place of any human habitation, and had only a sketchy idea of where they were—Petermann's map provided few useful details. On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.

On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help. Ambler was offered the opportunity to go with them, but felt that his duty as a doctor required him to stay with the main body.

For the next week De Long's party struggled on, sometimes making barely a mile a day. Although they jettisoned more of their possessions on the way, De Long insisted on carrying his maps and journals. His entry for October 10 recorded that there was "nothing for supper but a spoonful of glycerine". A few days later Alexey, the group's principal hunter, shot a <a href="ptarmigan">ptarmigan</a> which provided soup. But Alexey was weakening, and on October 17 he died.

On October 20, trapped by the weather and without supplies, the party came to a final halt. Throughout the march De Long had written up his journal each day, but after October 20 his entries became intermittent, largely limited to terse statements of the dying and the dead. He noted the deaths of Kaak and Lee on October 21, Iverson on the 28th, Dressler on the 29th. His last entry, dated October 30, records the deaths of Boyd and Görtz and ends "Mr Collins dying".

After resting at Arrhu, Melville's group moved out, aiming for the agreed rendezvous at Bulun. On September 19 they encountered native <a href="Tungusic%20peoples">Tungus</a> huntsmen, who led the party first to the tiny settlement of Little Borkhia, and then on to the larger village of Zemovialach. Here, locals advised them that they would have to wait for the river to freeze before attempting to reach Bulun.

After several weeks, Melville learned from a Russian traveler that two Americans were recuperating at Bulun. Weather conditions were now suitable for travel, so Melville hired a pair of expert local dog drivers to take him to Bulun. He left Danenhower in charge, with instructions to lead the party to Bulun as soon as practicable, and from there to proceed as best he could to <a href="Yakutsk">Yakutsk</a>, a large city hundreds of miles to the south.

Melville arrived in Bulun on November 3, where he found Nindemann and Noros, weak but recovering. From them, Melville learned of De Long's plight and his urgent need for rescue. The pair had endured a harrowing experience since leaving De Long nearly a month previously. They had struggled for ten days, sleeping in improvised shelters and eating what they could catch or shoot. In this fashion they reached a small, abandoned camp which they later learned was named Bulcour.

Here, they had been found by a nomadic band of <a href="Yakuts">Yakut</a> hunters, who had taken them to a large camp at Kumakh-Surt. To their great frustration they were unable to make the Yakuts understand that they were shipwrecked mariners whose comrades were in dire straits. They did manage to convey their desire to reach Bulun, and were taken there by sled, arriving on October 29 a few days before Melville joined them there.

From Bulun, Melville sent messages to Washington and the "Herald", advising them of "Jeannette's" loss and listing the survivors and missing parties. On November 5 he set out with two local guides, using rough maps supplied by Nindemann and Noros, to begin his search for De Long.

At the village of North Bulun, natives brought him notes left by De Long's party in cairns. One note directed Melville to the cache of logbooks and instruments that De Long had buried at his landing-place. Although now convinced that De Long and his comrades must have died, Melville continued the search, but the encroaching Arctic winter meant that he could do no more that season. He returned to Bulun at the end of November, and then traveled on to Yakutsk to be reunited with the other "Jeannette" survivors.

In January 1882, while most of the survivors began their long journey home, Melville, Nindemann and James Bartlett prepared to head a new search in the delta when weather allowed. They left Yakutsk on January 16, and resumed their search when the thaw began in mid-March. Beginning at the spot where Nindemann and Noros had left De Long the previous October, Melville began a systematic examination of the area. On March 23 he found Alexey's hunting rifle and, nearby, the remains of a camp. The team found further artifacts, a frozen human arm protruding from the snow, and finally De Long's journal. From this they learned the story of the party's final days.

Soon, all the bodies except that of Alexey, which was never found, had been recovered. Those of the last three to die—De Long, Ambler and Ah Sam—were some distance from the rest, where they had evidently attempted to set up a final camp on higher ground. Melville's party wrapped all the bodies in canvas, and carried them to a hill high enough to be safe from seasonal flooding. There they placed them in a large coffin improvised from driftwood, which they covered with rocks surmounted by a large wooden cross, inscribed with the names of the lost men. Melville's group left the site on , then spent a further month in the delta, searching without success for signs of Chipp and his crew.

Of the total expedition party of 33 men, 13 returned alive to the United States. The first group of survivors landed in New York in May 1882, but celebrations were deferred until the arrival, on September 13, of Melville, Nindemann, and Noros. They were welcomed as heroes, given a civic reception, and treated to a banquet at the celebrated <a href="Delmonico%27s">Delmonico's</a> restaurant.
Public interest in the "Jeannette" story had been high since the first news of the ship's fate had been received from Yakutsk. Bennett had dispatched several reporters to Russia, including John P. Jackson, who had reached the Lena Delta and found the tomb of De Long. In his zeal for a story, Jackson had opened the tomb to search for papers or other records, an act of desecration that Emma De Long described to Bennett as "the bitterest potion I had to swallow in my whole life". Jackson had also interviewed Danenhower, who made allegations of discord within the party and of ill-treatment of certain officers, particularly himself.

A <a href="Naval%20Board%20of%20Inquiry">naval inquiry</a> into the loss of the "Jeannette" convened at the beginning of October, at which the survivors were the principal witnesses. In February 1883 the board announced its findings: "Jeannette" was a fit vessel for Arctic service; difficulties such as the late start and the diversion to search for news of "Vega" were not De Long's fault, nor was he to blame for the ship's loss. He had conducted the subsequent retreat in an exemplary manner.

Not everybody was satisfied; relatives of Collins, who had heard during the evidence of trouble between De Long and the meteorologist, did not believe that the whole truth had been told, and termed the enquiry a "whitewash". In April 1884 a <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> Naval Affairs subcommittee reviewed the evidence, and confirmed the findings of the earlier enquiry.

In February 1882 Secretary Thompson had despatched naval lieutenants Giles Harber and William Schuetze to the delta to search for any traces of the lost explorers, particularly of Chipp's party. They were unsuccessful, but in November received orders from the secretary to supervise the return of the bodies of De Long and his comrades to the United States. Weather and bureaucracy delayed them for a year; in November 1883 the bodies were taken from Yakutsk by train to <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>, <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, and finally <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, from where they were transported to New York City by SS "Frisia", in February 1884.

The funeral cortège was escorted by naval and military detachments to the Church of the Holy Trinity on <a href="Madison%20Avenue">Madison Avenue</a> for a memorial service. Afterwards the bodies of Ambler, Collins, and Boyd were claimed for private burial; those of De Long and six others were taken to <a href="Woodlawn%20Cemetery%20%28Bronx%2C%20New%20York%29">Woodlawn Cemetery</a> in <a href="the%20Bronx">the Bronx</a>, and buried together there. In October 1890 a large monument to the expedition's dead was unveiled at the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> in <a href="Annapolis">Annapolis</a>. Its design is based on the original cairn and cross raised at the burial site on the Lena Delta.
A mountain range in Alaska, and two naval ships, were named in De Long's honor. The three Arctic islands discovered during the expedition, plus two others discovered a few years later, form an archipelago that bears the name <a href="De%20Long%20Islands">De Long Islands</a>; despite Melville's planting of the American flag, the islands have always been accepted as Russian territory.

On , Congress authorized the <a href="Jeannette%20Medal">Jeannette Medal</a>—8 <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a>s and 25 <a href="Congressional%20Silver%20Medal">Congressional Silver Medal</a>s—in commemoration of the perils encountered by the officers and men of the expedition.

The expedition provided some key scientific information. On , wreckage from "Jeannette" was found on an ice floe near <a href="Qaqortoq">Julianehåb</a>, near the south-western corner of Greenland. This proved that a continuous ocean current flowed from east to west across the polar sea, and was the basis of <a href="Nansen%27s%20Fram%20expedition">Nansen's "Fram" expedition</a> of 1893–1896. Also, although the Open Polar Sea theory ended with "Jeannette"s voyage, the ship's meteorological and oceanographic records have provided 21st-century climatologists with valuable data relating to climate change and the shrinking of the polar icecap.

Only one of the main survivors in the "Jeannette" drama, Melville, returned to the Arctic, where he helped rescue survivors of <a href="Adolphus%20Greely">Adolphus Greely</a>'s <a href="Lady%20Franklin%20Bay%20Expedition">Lady Franklin Bay Expedition</a> of 1881–1884. Melville's naval career prospered, and he eventually achieved the rank of <a href="Rear%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">rear admiral</a>. He died in 1912. Danenhower continued in the navy, but shot himself during a fit of depression in 1887.

In 1892, James Bartlett, who struggled with mental problems after his return, first threatened to kill his wife and niece before attempting to make good on his promise the next day. His wife survived with a gunshot wound to the shoulder, but both the niece and Bartlett died. Nindemann worked as a naval engineer until his death in 1913. The last survivor of the expedition was Herbert Leach, who became a factory worker; he lived until 1933. Emma De Long died at the age of 91, in 1940.

The Dawn of Love (painting)

The Dawn of Love, also known as Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens Love, is an <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> on canvas by English artist <a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a>, first exhibited in 1828 and currently in the <a href="Russell-Cotes%20Art%20Gallery%20%26amp%3B%20Museum">Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum</a> in <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>. Loosely based on a passage from <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a>'s 1634 <a href="masque">masque</a> "<a href="Comus%20%28John%20Milton%29">Comus</a>", it shows a <a href="nude%20%28art%29">nude</a> <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a> leaning across to wake the sleeping Love by stroking his wings. While Etty often included nude figures in his work, he rarely depicted physical intimacy, and owing to this, "The Dawn of Love" is one of his more unusual paintings. The open sensuality of the work was intended to present a challenge to the viewer mirroring the plot of "Comus", in which the heroine is tempted by desire but remains rational and detached.

While a few critics praised elements of its composition and execution, "The Dawn of Love" was very poorly received when first exhibited. Etty had developed a reputation for painting realistic figures, and his stylised Venus was thought unduly influenced by foreign artists such as <a href="Rubens">Rubens</a> as well as being overly voluptuous and unrealistically coloured, while the painting as a whole was considered tasteless and obscene. "The Dawn of Love" was not among the 133 paintings exhibited in the major 1849 <a href="retrospective%20exhibition">retrospective exhibition</a> of Etty's works, and its exhibition in Glasgow in 1899 drew complaints for its supposed obscenity. In 1889 it was bought by <a href="Merton%20Russell-Cotes">Sir Merton Russell-Cotes</a>, and has remained in the collection of the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum ever since.

<a href="William%20Etty">William Etty</a> was born in 1787, the son of a <a href="York">York</a> baker and miller. He began as an apprentice printer in <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>. On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved at the age of 18 to London "with a few pieces of chalk crayons", with the intention of becoming a <a href="history%20painting">history painter</a> in the tradition of the <a href="Old%20Masters">Old Masters</a>. He enrolled at the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a>, and after a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter <a href="Thomas%20Lawrence">Thomas Lawrence</a>, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the <a href="life%20class">life class</a> and copying other paintings. A follower of <a href="John%20Opie">John Opie</a>, who promoted the unfashionable painting style of <a href="Titian">Titian</a> and <a href="Rubens">Rubens</a> over the then-prevalent formal style of <a href="Joshua%20Reynolds">Joshua Reynolds</a>, Etty was unsuccessful in all the Academy's competitions and every work he submitted to the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20Summer%20Exhibition">Royal Academy Summer Exhibition</a> in the 1810s was rejected. In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works in the Summer Exhibition, "<a href="The%20Arrival%20of%20Cleopatra%20in%20Cilicia">The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia</a>" (also known as "The Triumph of Cleopatra"). This painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of "Cleopatra", over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting <a href="Nude%20%28art%29">nude figures</a> in biblical, literary and mythological settings.

While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 <a href="Proclamation%20for%20the%20Discouragement%20of%20Vice">Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice</a>. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and the reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of <a href="female%20nudity">female nudity</a> as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received.

"The Dawn of Love" illustrates an early passage from "<a href="Comus%20%28John%20Milton%29">Comus</a>", a 1634 <a href="masque">masque</a> by <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a>. "Comus" is a morality tale in which the female protagonist, referred to only as "The Lady", becomes separated from her family. She encounters the debauched magician <a href="Comus">Comus</a> who captures and imprisons her, and uses all the means at his disposal to try to inflame her sexual desires. The Lady resists all temptation, and using her reason and sense of morals resists Comus's efforts to draw her into intemperance or surrender to desire.

Etty's painting is not a direct illustration of a scene from "Comus". Instead, it is inspired by an early passage in which Comus, prior to his meeting with The Lady, muses on the notion that sin is only problematic if others become aware of it, and thus that it is right and natural to surrender to base desires while under cover of darkness, arguing that "What hath night to do with sleep? Night hath better sweets to prove, Venus now wakes, and wakens Love". Etty's painting shows the nude <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a>, as "Goddess of nocturnal sport", reaching across to wake the sleeping Love by stroking his wings. While Etty had built his reputation on his renowned ability to paint realistic human figures, Venus in "The Dawn of Love" is highly stylised, and painted in a deliberate pastiche of the style of Rubens.

"The Dawn of Love" intentionally presents a moral dilemma to viewers. By his open depiction of nudity and sensuality, Etty makes the same argument as that presented by Comus, that it is rational for the viewer to succumb to their lustful thoughts while in private. The picture presents the same moral challenge to the viewer as that which Comus presents to The Lady, that of remaining true to her better, moral and rational, nature, despite there being no apparent disadvantage in surrendering to desire.

While Etty regularly painted nudity, he rarely depicted physical intimacy other than in combat, and "The Dawn of Love" is unusual among his works; Etty's biographer Leonard Robinson commented in 2007 that "The Dawn of Love" "is a subject so untypical of Etty that one finds difficulty in understanding why he painted it".

Etty exhibited the painting in February 1828 at the <a href="British%20Institution">British Institution</a> under the title of "Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens Love". It immediately met with a storm of derision from critics for the style in which Venus was painted; one of the few positive reviews was that of "<a href="The%20New%20Monthly%20Magazine">The New Monthly Magazine</a>", whose critic considered "the figure of Venus is delightfully drawn and most voluptuously coloured; and the way in which she awakens love, by ruffling the feathers of his wings, is exquisitely imagined and executed". "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" commented that "the drawing is free and flowing" and "the colouring, though rich, is perfectly natural", but felt that "the subject is, however, handled in a way entirely too luscious (we might, with great propriety, use a harsher term) for the public eye". "<a href="The%20Literary%20Gazette">The Literary Gazette</a>" conceded that the painting was "very attractive, especially in colour", but considered the painting's "voluptuousness" as "one of the most unpardonable sins against taste", and chided Etty's "careless" drawing, observing that "it is impossible that an artist who has for so many years, and so unremittingly, studied the living model, can err in that respect from want of knowledge". The "<a href="Monthly%20Magazine">Monthly Magazine</a>" complained of Venus's "sullen colour and corpulent shape", as well as Etty's "excessive exposure of [Venus's] figure". "<a href="La%20Belle%20Assembl%C3%A9e">La Belle Assemblée</a>", meanwhile, felt that Etty's representation of Venus "though a fine voluptuous woman, is not, either in supremacy of beauty, or according to any received description of the love-inspiring goddess, a Venus", and complained that "the colouring of the flesh is chalky".

The harshest criticism came from an anonymous reviewer in "<a href="The%20London%20Magazine">The London Magazine</a>":

An anonymous reviewer in the same publication later that year returned to the theme, chiding Etty for his imitation of foreign artists rather than attempting to develop a new and unique style of his own, observing that "we cannot imitate the voice or the actions of another, without exaggerating or caricaturing them", complaining that there is "[no] propriety in seeing the Venuses of Titian, the fables of heathenism, or the base occupations of Dutch boors, placed in parallel with those subjects which form the basis [of] all our future hopes", and observing that "surely, Rubens ought here [in England] to be held up as rock to avoid, not a light to follow".

In February 1828, shortly after the exhibition of "The Dawn of Love", Etty defeated <a href="John%20Constable">John Constable</a> by 18 votes to five to become a full <a href="Royal%20Academician">Royal Academician</a>, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks from the press on his supposed indecency and tastelessness, Etty continued to be a prominent painter of nudes but began to make conscious efforts to reflect moral teachings in his work. He died in 1849, working and exhibiting up until his death and remained well-regarded as an artist despite being judged by many as a pornographer. <a href="Charles%20Robert%20Leslie">Charles Robert Leslie</a> observed shortly after Etty's death that himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds". Interest in his work declined as <a href="Victorian%20painting">new movements</a> came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices.

"The Dawn of Love" (under its original title of "Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens Love") was exhibited in 1829 at the <a href="Royal%20Birmingham%20Society%20of%20Artists">Birmingham Society of Arts</a>, but other than that its history during Etty's lifetime is not recorded. No record of its original sale exists, and it was not among the 133 paintings included in the major <a href="retrospective%20exhibition">retrospective exhibition</a> of Etty's works at the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Royal Society of Arts</a> in 1849. It is known that in 1835 it was in the collection of textile entrepreneur <a href="Joseph%20Strutt%20%28philanthropist%29">Joseph Strutt</a>, but it was not among the paintings sold on his death in 1844. In June 1889 it was bought from an unknown buyer for an unknown sum by <a href="Sir%20Merton%20Russell-Cotes">Sir Merton Russell-Cotes</a>, and has remained in the collection of the <a href="Russell-Cotes%20Art%20Gallery%20%26amp%3B%20Museum">Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum</a> in <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> ever since. It was shown at an 1899 exhibition of works from Russell-Cotes's collection at the <a href="Glasgow%20Corporation%20Gallery">Glasgow Corporation Gallery</a>. This exhibition caused some controversy owing to its supposed obscene nature; in 1894 a number of supposedly obscene <a href="Printmaking">prints</a> of works by major artists had been removed from a Glasgow shop by police and magistrates, and it was felt inappropriate for a publicly funded educational body to be displaying a work of equal obscenity. Several luminaries of the art world such as <a href="Frederic%20Leighton">Frederic Leighton</a> intervened, and the exhibition went ahead. "The Dawn of Love" was also exhibited at a 1955 <a href="Arts%20Council">Arts Council</a> exhibition, and was one of the works exhibited in a major retrospective of Etty's works at the <a href="York%20Art%20Gallery">York Art Gallery</a> in 2011–12.

Gabriel Pleydell

Gabriel Pleydell ( 1519 – 1591) of Midg Hall in the parish of <a href="Lydiard%20Tregoze">Lydiard St John</a> (later <a href="Lydiard%20Tregoze">Lydiard Tregoze</a>) in Wiltshire, was an English landowner and politician who served as <a href="Member%20of%20parliament%23United%20Kingdom">Member of Parliament</a> for the <a href="Wootton%20Bassett%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Wootton Bassett</a> and <a href="Marlborough%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Marlborough</a> constituencies in the <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament of England</a>. Pleydell was born before 1519 into a large, affluent family. He entered politics in March 1553 as a member for Wootton Bassett, close to his family estate at Midgehall in <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a>. Pleydell's election to the Marlborough constituency two years later may have been made possible by his father's influential connections. He returned to the Wootton Bassett seat at the request of <a href="John%20Thynne">Sir John Thynne</a> in 1563; he had supported Thynne in a dispute over the <a href="Knights%20of%20the%20Shire">Knighthood of the Shire</a> in 1559.

Pleydell's political and personal life is marked by legal controversy. Almost always a defendant in court, known allegations include the forced expulsion of residents from a <a href="manor">country manor</a>, forcible entry into and seizure of goods from a private property, unlawfully protecting convicts from justice, <a href="forgery">forging</a> documents for his own benefit, and <a href="poaching">illegal hunting</a>. He was alleged to be one of the ringleaders of a plot to exile <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Queen Mary of England</a>, and is perhaps best known for his contentious claim of <a href="parliamentary%20privilege">parliamentary privilege</a> after he was found guilty of this offence in 1555, an action which caused serious disagreement between the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20England">House of Commons</a> and the <a href="House%20of%20Lords%23History">House of Lords</a>. Legal accusations for most of his political career and imprisonment in <a href="Fleet%20Prison">Fleet Prison</a> and the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> helped "confirm for Gabriel Pleydell a niche in parliamentary history", according to a modern historian. He died between 19 December 1590 and 3 February 1591.

Pleydell was born by 1519. The sixth of nine children, he was the fourth son of wealthy <a href="tenant%20farmer">tenant farmer</a> William Pleydell of <a href="Coleshill%2C%20Oxfordshire">Coleshill, Berkshire</a>—now <a href="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>—and Agnes Reason (daughter of Robert Reason of <a href="Corfe%20Castle%20%28village%29">Corfe Castle</a>, Dorset). His younger brother was <a href="John%20Pleydell%20%28died%201608%29">John Pleydell</a>, <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament%23United%20Kingdom">Member</a> for <a href="Cricklade%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Cricklade</a> in 1593. The Pleydell family were thought to descend from Thomas de Coleshill, a <a href="Knight%23Crusades">knight</a> who was awarded lordship of the eponymous parish on 2 March 1275 by <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">King Edward I</a>. Gabriel came of age by 1540, holding land once owned by <a href="Anthony%20Hungerford%20of%20Down%20Ampney">Sir Anthony Hungerford</a> at <a href="Latton%2C%20Wiltshire%23Eysey">Eysey</a> (near the parish of <a href="Cricklade">Cricklade</a>).

Pleydell's father, William, had been given a 95-year lease of the Midgehall estate in <a href="Lydiard%20Tregoze">Lydiard Tregoze</a> by the Abbott of <a href="Stanley%20Abbey">Stanley Abbey</a> in 1534. A 1545 record, ordering Gabriel to pay 26 <a href="shilling%20%28English%20coin%29">shillings</a> and 8 <a href="penny%20%28English%20coin%29">pence</a> in benevolence to the crown under <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">King Henry VIII</a>, indicates that he was soon managing Midgehall's financial affairs. His father entrusted him in 1549 with tenancy of the manor house at <a href="West%20Ilsley%2C%20Berkshire">West Ilsley, Berkshire</a> and in September 1553 a <a href="sublease">sublease</a> of the Midgehall estate. William died in 1555, leaving Midgehall's full lease to his wife, Agnes. When she died in 1567, Gabriel unsuccessfully challenged his mother's will (an action which estranged his younger brother, John) despite inheriting tenancy of the estate. Pleydell's father originally intended two of his elder sons—Virgil and Tobias—to succeed ownership before Gabriel. Virgil died around 1559 and by 1567 Tobias had been resident in <a href="Faringdon">Chipping Faringdon</a> for 11 years, prompting him to <a href="Disclaimer%20of%20interest">relinquish</a> his inheritance.

He married Anne Stockes, a daughter of Henry Stockes of <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a>, by whom he had two surviving children:

Gabriel is the principal ancestor of the Pleydells of <a href="Milborne%20St%20Andrew">Milborne St Andrew</a>, later removed to <a href="Whatcombe%2C%20Dorset">Whatcombe</a>, both in <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>. Contained within this lineage was <a href="Edmund%20Morton%20Pleydell">Edmund Morton Pleydell</a>, a Member of Parliament for <a href="Dorchester%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Dorchester</a> from 1722 to 1723 and for <a href="Dorset%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Dorset</a> from 1727 until 1747. His own father, <a href="Edmund%20Pleydell">Edmund Pleydell</a>, similarly served as a Member of Parliament for <a href="Wootton%20Bassett%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Wootton Bassett</a> from December 1710 until 1715.

Pleydell's initial entrance to the <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament of England</a> in March 1553 as a member for the market town of <a href="Royal%20Wootton%20Bassett">Wootton Bassett</a> was, at least in part, made possible by his status as a wealthy landholder. Although he had not yet inherited the lease on the family estate of Midgehall, his purchases of land and property surrounding the manor (one mile from the constituency) in 1561 and 1562 suggest that his assets facilitated a seat in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20England">House of Commons</a>. The constituency was eventually abolished by the <a href="Reform%20Act%201832">Reform Act 1832</a>. Surviving records note Pleydell's returning to Parliament solely by his Christian name, deemed sufficiently unusual to identify him outright. Succeeding members <a href="John%20Seymour%20%28died%201552%29">John Seymour</a> and <a href="Robert%20Huick">Robert Huick</a> from the 1547–52 session, Pleydell served with <a href="William%20Garrard%20%28died%201559%29">William Garrard</a> for just 30 days in March until a <a href="dissolution%20of%20Parliament">dissolution of Parliament</a>. They were replaced in October by <a href="Henry%20Poole%20%28died%201580%29">Henry Poole</a> and <a href="John%20Throckmorton%20%28died%201556%29">John Throckmorton</a>.

His 1555 election for <a href="Marlborough%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Marlborough</a> was similar, but more dependent on influential connections. Pleydell's father had once leased the lands of <a href="Thomas%20Seymour%2C%201st%20Baron%20Seymour%20of%20Sudeley">Thomas Seymour</a> in the nearby parish of Eastrop (and possibly <a href="Preshute">Preshute</a>), establishing a relationship of trust between the families. After Seymour's brother <a href="Edward%20Seymour%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">Edward</a> was executed in 1552, his widow <a href="Anne%20Seymour%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Somerset">Anne</a> inherited the responsibility of maintaining the vast estates. The Duchess appointed Pleydell as chief ranger of <a href="Savernake%20Forest">Savernake Forest</a> (then under her ownership) before 1554 and as her <a href="receiver%20general">receiver general</a> that year. His position as ranger probably led to the acquisition of property in <a href="Chippenham%2C%20Wiltshire">Chippenham</a> and Preshute, and his status as a Preshute landholder assisted him in becoming Member for <a href="Marlborough%2C%20Wiltshire">Marlborough</a>. Pleydell, serving with <a href="Andrew%20Baynton">Sir Andrew Baynton</a>, replaced <a href="Peter%20Taylor%20alias%20Perce">Peter Taylor alias Perce</a> and <a href="John%20Broke">John Broke</a> of the 1554 session; they were succeeded by <a href="William%20Daniell%20%28died%201604%29">William Daniell</a> and <a href="William%20Fleetwood%20%28MP%20for%20Lancaster%29">William Fleetwood</a> in 1558 after a parliamentary hiatus following the death of <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Queen Mary</a>.

Pleydell returned as a Member for Wootton Bassett in 1563. His appointment was made possible by the patronage of former Member for Marlborough <a href="John%20Thynne">Sir John Thynne</a>, an eminent figure in Wiltshire politics who was the county's "<a href="custos%20rotulorum">custos rotulorum</a>" for at least 20 years. Pleydell had supported Thynne in a contest over the <a href="Knights%20of%20the%20Shire">Knighthood of the Shire</a> in 1559, which doubtless assisted his bid for parliamentary selection. Wootton Bassett's other seat was occupied by <a href="Matthew%20Poyntz">Matthew Poyntz</a>, with whom Pleydell served until 1567. Replacing <a href="Christopher%20Dysmars">Christopher Dysmars</a> and <a href="Humphrey%20Moseley%20%28MP%29">Humphrey Moseley</a> from the 1559 session, they were succeeded in 1571 by <a href="Henry%20Knyvet">Henry Knyvet</a> and <a href="John%20Winchcombe%20%28died%201574%29">John Winchcombe</a>.

Pleydell's parliamentary tenure was plagued by legal controversy. Usually a <a href="defendant">defendant</a> in the courts, he was the <a href="plaintiff">plaintiff</a> in at least three cases. Toward the end of the reign of <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">King Edward VI</a>, he brought a charge in the <a href="Star%20Chamber">Star Chamber</a> against several men who forced his expulsion from the manor house at <a href="Withington%2C%20Gloucestershire">Withington, Gloucestershire</a> that he was leasing. The second was a case brought to the <a href="Court%20of%20Chancery">Court of Chancery</a> between 1558 and 1579, with Gabriel accusing his brother Tobias (known in the court documents as "Toby") in a dispute over the Midgehall estate. The same Court also heard a dispute initiated by Pleydell against Sir John St. John, his son's father-in-law, at an unknown date; Gabriel claimed that Midgehall had certain pasture rights in the Flaxlands area, then under St. John's ownership.

The first serious allegation against Pleydell in the Star Chamber concerned the forced expulsion of an occupant of the manor house at <a href="East%20Grafton">East Grafton, Somerset</a> in late 1553. He was accused of assisting <a href="John%20Berwick%20%28died%201572%29">John Berwick</a> in the original infringement and composing an amenable jury in Marlborough to avoid conviction. Both were found innocent of breaching the peace and claimed to have acted at the reasonable request of their employer, Anne Seymour; undue interference with judicial proceedings was ruled out. Around the same time, Pleydell was sued for forcible entry and illegal seizure of property at <a href="Little%20Bedwyn">Little Bedwyn</a> (with similar offences at <a href="Collingbourne%20Ducis">Collingbourne Ducis</a>) but claimed to be acting on the failure of the plaintiff to punctually pay rent.

Pleydell was a <a href="English%20Reformation">Protestant</a>, and he is described by P. W. Hasler as "a religious and political radical" under Queen Mary, and voted against a government bill in 1555 while he was a Member for Marlborough. This, combined with his previous offences, may have been the reason for his internment at the notorious <a href="Fleet%20Prison">Fleet Prison</a> at the dissolution of Parliament that year. A fervent supporter of <a href="Anthony%20Kingston">Sir Anthony Kingston</a> in the House of Commons, Pleydell came to be associated with <a href="Henry%20Dudley%20%28conspirator%29">Sir Henry Dudley</a>'s plot to exile Mary and ensure the succession of the future <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth</a> to the throne (a foiled venture which led to Kingston's unexplained death and Dudley's voluntary exile to France); the Star Chamber accused Gabriel of inciting riots opposing Mary's reign. He was therefore "regarded as a ringleader" of the conspiracy and claimed <a href="parliamentary%20privilege">parliamentary privilege</a> when the Star Chamber found him guilty during the <a href="Michaelmas">Michaelmas</a> term of the 1555 session. The charges were supported by a £500 <a href="bond%20%28finance%29">bond</a> and a <a href="writ">writ</a> ordered by the court, possibly a crown action to intimidate future opposition in Parliament. The Commons accepted his claim that his privilege had been infringed and sent a delegation led by <a href="Robert%20Rochester">Sir Robert Rochester</a> on 6 December to the <a href="House%20of%20Lords%20of%20England">House of Lords</a> in support of his immunity.

Lawyers <a href="David%20Lewis%20%28lawyer%29">David Lewis</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Martin%20%28died%201593%29">Thomas Martin</a>, witnessed by Rochester, <a href="Sir%20William%20Petre">Sir William Petre</a> and four unnamed members, declared the opinion of all <a href="Lord%20Chief%20Justice%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Chief Justices</a>, <a href="Serjeants-at-Law">Serjeants-at-Law</a> and <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Rolls">Master of the Rolls</a> <a href="Nicholas%20Hare">Sir Nicholas Hare</a> that Pleydell's privilege had not been infringed and the charges would persist. The Commons, dissatisfied with the ruling, refused to allow further action against Pleydell and may have blocked other suits accusing him until its dissolution three days later. Pleydell was released from prison on 28 December 1555, after paying an additional bond of £500 to the crown. His freedom was conditional on returning to the Star Chamber to pay another £45 on the first day of its next term, which he did. At his release Pleydell told the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20England">Privy Council</a> that he was punished for "speaking his conscience ... in a bill concerning the commonwealth", an opinion he subsequently echoed abroad. The Star Chamber considered his comments <a href="defamation">slanderous</a>; it is unclear whether judicial action was taken regarding them.

In 1557 Pleydell was charged in the chamber by former associate John Berwick, who accused him of protecting two felons from punishment. The men (one convicted of murder and the other of abetting a theft) were Pleydell's servants in his capacity as chief ranger and keeper of Savernake Forest. Berwick, assumed by the historian Stanley Thomas Bindoff to be acting out of jealousy, was the previous holder of the titles and involved in a dispute with Pleydell over the rights to property near the forest. Pleydell enlisted the aid of serving and former members of parliament, including <a href="William%20Button%20%28died%201547%29">William Button</a>, <a href="Henry%20Clifford%20%28died%201577%29">Henry Clifford</a>, <a href="Griffith%20Curteys">Griffith Curteys</a> and <a href="John%20Hooper%20%28died%201572%29">John Hooper</a>, in July. Their duty was to examine witnesses and evidence on both sides of the argument, and they presented a list of 240 articles concerning the servants' activities. Pleydell's efforts were seen by the court as an attempt to undermine the integrity of the Queen's justices and, perhaps, to incite rebellion among his supporters. This, in addition to breaching a commitment to meet regularly with the Privy Council under <a href="recognizance">recognizance</a> after his imprisonment, led to his indictment by <a href="Attorney%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Attorney-General</a> <a href="Edward%20Griffin%20%28attorney%29">Edward Griffin</a> during the Michaelmas term. Pleydell was incarcerated in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>, forfeiting his two £500 bonds. He was released for good behaviour on 19 December, and left for the home of cloth merchant Thomas Garrard (a kinsman of the William Garrard with whom Pleydell served as Member for Wootton Bassett) after posting a £1,000 bond.

Multiple allegations of forgery were brought against Pleydell in the Court of Chancery. Although the circumstances of many are unknown, a significant suit was initiated by Member for Chippenham <a href="Francis%20Newdigate%20%28MP%29">Francis Newdigate</a> at the start of the 1563 parliamentary session, when Pleydell is known to have been in a considerable amount of debt. Newdigate, second husband of Anne Seymour (Pleydell's employer), accused Pleydell of forgery with regard to the manor of Monkton in his constituency, which his spouse owned and Gabriel had leased since 1559. Details are unclear, but Newdigate introduced the case to the House of Commons between 11 and 27 February 1563, probably in light of discussion surrounding the proposed <a href="Forgery%20Act%201563">Forgery Act 1563</a> (5 Eliz.1 c.14). On 22 March, the Commons assembled a committee made up of <a href="Recorder%20of%20London">Recorder of London</a> <a href="Richard%20Onslow%20%28Solicitor%20General%29">Richard Onslow</a>, <a href="Nicholas%20Arnold%20%281507%E2%80%931580%29">Sir Nicholas Arnold</a>, <a href="Walter%20Haddon">Walter Haddon</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Norton">Thomas Norton</a> and Master of the Rolls <a href="William%20Cordell">Sir William Cordell</a> to investigate Newdigate's suspicions. Cordell's involvement as an official of the judiciary may indicate that Pleydell had again claimed parliamentary privilege against Newdigate's allegations, since the case was heard in the Court of Chancery while he was a sitting Member for Wootton Bassett. The committee expressed "great and vehement suspicion" of Pleydell in a report which he read and answered. On 10 April the House ordered that copies of committee documents should be given to Pleydell and Newdigate and that Pleydell's evidence would be kept by the Commons, and no further mention of the affair is evident.

The later career of Sir Andrew Baynton, with whom Pleydell had served as Member for Marlborough, was overshadowed by financial difficulty. In a perceived attempt to gain court favour and reduce his debts, Baynton entrusted Thomas Seymour with his lands (presumably temporarily). When Seymour was executed for treason in 1549, the lands fell into the possession of the crown. Queen Mary negotiated their sale to several members of the Wiltshire gentry, including <a href="Nicholas%20Snell%20%28died%201577%29">Nicholas Snell</a> and Pleydell. Gabriel would acquire the manor houses of the <a href="Bremhill">Bremhill</a> and <a href="Bromham%2C%20Wiltshire">Bromham</a> parishes in 1562. Pleydell is thought to have gone further in the pursuit of Baynton's estates; he and <a href="Henry%20Sharington">Henry Sharington</a> were to be the executors of his will upon his death in 1564. Assigning themselves his properties in Chippenham, the couple (described by Alison Wall in the "<a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>" as "scoundrels" and by R. J. W. Swales as "unscrupulous adventurers") directed Baynton's money and estates to themselves, contrary to his intended <a href="fee%20tail">entailment</a> of the assets to his brother <a href="Edward%20Bayntun%20%28died%201593%29">Edward</a>. Sharington has consequently been described by Wall as "corrupt" and Pleydell as "notorious"; according to Bindoff, the action "confirm[s] for Gabriel Pleydell a niche in parliamentary history, detract[ing] still further from his reputation". Pleydell released any titles inherited from the acquired estates, which included the manors of the <a href="Clench%2C%20Wiltshire">Clench</a> and <a href="Bremhill%23Geography">Stanley</a> hamlets, to Edward Baynton (Andrew's brother) on 19 July 1566 and the Privy Council therefore rejected allegations of forgery against him. Edward had long been suspicious of Pleydell and Sharington, and brought an unsuccessful forgery charge against them to a <a href="prerogative%20court">prerogative court</a> as early as July 1560. He also ordered an attack on Pleydell's servants after his acquisition of the Bremhill and Bromham properties.

Pleydell, his patron Sir John Thynne and others were indicted in 1564 and he returned to Fleet Prison charged with <a href="poaching">illegal hunting</a> in <a href="Selwood%20Forest">Selwood Forest</a>. Pleydell was given leave under escort to attend impending "great suits" against him (probably related to the Baynton family's forgery litigation). He was again accused of similar offences years later, and the prosecution called Pleydell and his accomplices "persons of long time acquainted with such lewd devices and practices".

Other suits were brought against Pleydell in later life. In 1587 he was to appear before the Privy Council for <a href="mediation">mediation</a> in an unclear suit initiated by his successor to the Wootton Bassett seat, Sir Henry Knyvet, now knighted. He is listed as living in <a href="Towcester%2C%20Northamptonshire">Towcester, Northamptonshire</a> for the Kynvet proceedings, possibly related to a family tie with the Saunders of nearby <a href="Syresham">Syresham</a>. In July 1590 a clerk of the Privy Council registered Pleydell as having returned indefinitely to the estate in Midgehall.

Pleydell, "sick in body", wrote his <a href="will%20%28document%29">will</a> on 19 December 1590; the document, furnished by <a href="creditor">creditor</a> Oliver Frye on 3 February 1591, places his death between the two dates. His wife received ten cows and 100 sheep (then valued at about <a href="%C2%A3sd">£</a>60) and half of his personal possessions and household goods at the Midgehall estate. Each of his servants and his eventual burial place, <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Lydiard%20Tregoze">St Mary's Church</a> in Lydiard Tregoze, were to receive 10 shillings, and the combined poor of the parish 20 shillings. The profits from some of Pleydell's lands were entrusted to political associates <a href="Charles%20Danvers">Sir Charles Danvers</a>, <a href="John%20Danvers%20%28died%201594%29">Sir John Danvers</a>, Sir John St. John and Sir Edward Baynton, now knighted; it was hoped that Pleydell's grandson Charles (then a minor) would inherit a considerable fortune. The remainder was gifted to Agnes, his only daughter and sole <a href="executrix">executrix</a>; she paid the document's overseers, <a href="Richard%20Danvers">Richard Danvers</a> and Gabriel's nephew Robert Wells, 20 shillings for their services.

Of the 300,000 coins authorized by Congress, fewer than half were actually struck, and of these, 55,000 were returned to the Mint and released into circulation. The coin excited some controversy because of its sponsorship by a religious group. The choice of <a href="William%20the%20Silent">William the Silent</a> and <a href="Gaspard%20II%20de%20Coligny">Gaspard de Coligny</a> to appear on the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> was also questioned as the men are considered martyrs by the Huguenots and died decades before the voyage of the "Nieuw Nederlandt". The coins are currently valued in the hundreds of dollars, depending on condition.

The <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a>s were French Protestants, who were often in conflict with the Catholic majority. Many Huguenots fled France in the 16th and 17th centuries, when there was intense persecution of them, most notably in the <a href="St.%20Bartholomew%27s%20Day%20massacre">St. Bartholomew's Day massacre</a> of 1572. Among those who fell in the bloodbath that day was the Huguenot military and political leader, Admiral <a href="Gaspard%20II%20de%20Coligny">Gaspard de Coligny</a>.

Many Huguenots who fled France settled in the Netherlands. <a href="William%20the%20Silent">William the Silent</a> was one of the leaders of the <a href="Dutch%20Revolt">Dutch Revolt</a> against Spain. He was assassinated in 1584 by <a href="Balthasar%20G%C3%A9rard">Balthasar Gérard</a>, a pro-Spanish zealot. There were Protestant <a href="Walloons">Walloons</a> in what is now Belgium. Some Huguenots and Walloons went elsewhere: on March 29, 1624, the ship "Nieuw Nederlandt" set out for <a href="New%20Netherland">New Netherland</a>, the Dutch possessions centered on what is now the state of New York; more ships followed. They represented a large proportion of the early settlers of the area. In 1626, <a href="Peter%20Minuit">Peter Minuit</a>, the Director General for the <a href="Dutch%20West%20India%20Company">Dutch West India Company</a>, famously purchased the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans for goods worth some 60 guilders, often rendered as $24.

The Huguenot-Walloon New Netherland Commission was established in 1922 under the auspices of the <a href="Federal%20Council%20of%20Churches">Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America</a> in anticipation of the upcoming anniversary. President <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> was the honorary president of the commission, and King <a href="Albert%20I%20of%20Belgium">Albert I of Belgium</a> accepted an honorary chairmanship. The commission, led by its chairman, Rev. Dr. John Baer Stoudt, planned an observance for the 300th anniversary of the "Nieuw Nederlandt" voyage, and sought the issuance of commemorative stamps and coins. At the time, commemorative coins were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins at face value and vend them to the public at a premium.

A bill for a Huguenot-Walloon half dollar was introduced in the House of Representatives on January 15, 1923, by Pennsylvania Congressman <a href="Fred%20Gernerd">Fred Gernerd</a>, who was of Huguenot descent. It received a hearing before the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures on February 7, with Indiana Representative <a href="Albert%20Vestal">Albert Vestal</a>, a Republican, presiding. Congressman Gernerd told the committee that there were plans to have local celebrations in 1924 to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the Huguenot voyage in cities where people of that heritage lived. Gernerd stated that while the sale of half dollars would raise money towards the observance, it was not intended as a serious fundraiser, but as a symbol of the occasion. He reminded the committee that the 300th anniversary of the voyage of the "<a href="Mayflower">Mayflower</a>" had <a href="Pilgrim%20Tercentenary%20half%20dollar">seen a half dollar issued</a>.
Vestal stated that he could not support the bill as introduced because it did not designate who should order the coins, but Gernerd indicated that the Fifth National Bank of New York had agreed to act in that capacity. Stoudt appeared before the committee, explaining that his commission planned a design with the arrival of the "Nieuw Nederlandt" for one side, and for the other, <a href="Peter%20Minuit">Peter Minuit</a> purchasing Manhattan from the Native Americans. New Jersey Congressman <a href="Ernest%20R.%20Ackerman">Ernest R. Ackerman</a> briefly addressed the committee in support, noting that the coins would likely be retained as souvenirs, to the profit of the government. West Virginia's <a href="Wells%20Goodykoontz">Wells Goodykoontz</a> also spoke in favor. The witnesses, all urging passage of the bill, concluded with a number of local pastors, led by E. O. Watson, secretary of the Federal Council of Churches. On February 10, 1923, Vestal issued a report recommending that the bill pass with an amendment adding the bank as the ordering organization.

A parallel bill was introduced into the Senate by Pennsylvania's <a href="David%20A.%20Reed">David A. Reed</a> on January 29, 1923, and was referred to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Banking%2C%20Housing%2C%20and%20Urban%20Affairs">Committee on Banking and Currency</a>. It was reported favorably on February 9 by Pennsylvania's <a href="George%20W.%20Pepper">George Pepper</a>, and the Senate passed the bill without objection. The Senate-passed bill was received by the House the following day and was referred to Vestal's committee. On February 19, the House considered its bill on the <a href="unanimous%20consent">unanimous consent</a> calendar. Gernerd asked that the Senate-passed bill be substituted for the House bill (the two were identical) and when this was agreed, proffered an amendment to add the bank as the depository for the coins. Texas Congressman <a href="Thomas%20Lindsay%20Blanton">Thomas L. Blanton</a> asked several questions about the bank's interest, but subsided once he was told that it would receive no compensation and that President Harding was connected with the commission. The amended bill passed the House without objection. The following day, the Senate agreed to the House amendment, and the bill was enacted by Harding's signature on February 26, 1923. The act provided for a maximum of 300,000 half dollars.

Stoudt supplied the concept for the coins, as well as sketches. Rather than seeking a private designer to produce plaster models, the Huguenot-Walloon commission approached the Mint's chief engraver, <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">George T. Morgan</a>, who turned 78 in 1923. Morgan, best remembered for his 1878 design for the <a href="Morgan%20dollar">Morgan dollar</a>, had been chief engraver since 1917, following forty years as an assistant, mostly under Chief Engraver <a href="Charles%20E.%20Barber">Charles E. Barber</a>. Both Barber and Morgan felt that coins should be designed by the Mint's engravers, and were sometimes hostile when private sculptors were engaged to do the work.

Morgan's models were transmitted on October 26, 1923, to the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>, charged with rendering advisory opinions on coins by a 1921 <a href="executive%20order">executive order</a> by President Harding. Morgan's work was examined by sculptor member <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a>, designer of the <a href="Buffalo%20nickel">Buffalo nickel</a>. On November 19, committee chairman Charles Moore wrote to Mint Director <a href="Robert%20J.%20Grant">Robert J. Grant</a>, "while the ideas intended to be expressed are excellent, the execution is bad. The lettering is poor, the heads are not well modeled and the ship is ill designed. The workmanship is below the standard of excellence attained in previous coins. The models are therefore not approved."

After discussion, it was decided to allow Morgan to revise his model under Fraser's supervision. Numismatists Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a> noted, "[This] must have been doubly and trebly humiliating in that Fraser's initial was then adorning the current 5¢ nickel, while neither Barber's nor Morgan's was on any regular issue coinage then in production". On January 3, 1924, Fraser wrote to Moore that the new models had been considerably improved, and complained that Vestal had advised the Huguenot-Walloon commission to have the models made at the Mint as he had been told by its officials that private artists made models in a <a href="relief">relief</a> too high to be easily coined. "It seems to me perfectly disgusting that this inane and lying criticism should go on constantly". The Fine Arts Commission approved the revised designs.

The obverse features <a href="jugate">jugate</a> busts of French admiral <a href="Gaspard%20II%20de%20Coligny">Gaspard de Coligny</a> (1519–1572) and Dutch leader <a href="William%20the%20Silent">William the Silent</a> (1533–1584). Neither had any direct involvement with the voyage of the "Nieuw Nederlandt", having been killed forty years or longer before it. Both were Protestant leaders of <a href="the%20Reformation">the Reformation</a>, and according to Swiatek, "their relationship with the 1624 founding was strictly spiritual in nature," as the two are considered martyrs by Huguenots. The 1924 "Report of the Director of the Mint" explained that both were "leaders in the strife for civil and religious liberty". Slabaugh, noting that the coin caused some controversy after it was issued, suggested that if the obverse had shown someone connected with the settlement of New Netherland, "chances are that the coin would have borne no religious significance and its promotion by the Churches of Christ in America would have been given little notice".

The March 29, 1924, edition of the <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> journal "<a href="America%20%28Jesuit%20magazine%29">America</a>" contained an article by F. J. Zwierlein, who stated that the new coin "is more Protestant than the descriptions in the newspaper dispatches led us to believe". He asserted that the two men featured on the coin were not killed for their religion and were anti-Catholic: "the United States Government was duped into issuing this Huguenot half-dollar so as to make a Protestant demonstration out of the tercentenary of the colonization of the State of New York". The president of the Huguenot Society of North Carolina responded in a <a href="letter%20to%20the%20editor">letter to the editor</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", "that Coligny and William the Silent were 'martyrs in the fight for religious liberty' let the truth of history attest".

The men have their names below the busts on the obverse, and wear hats of their period. They gaze toward the legend , the only one of the national mottos usually present on U.S. coins to appear. The name of the country arcs above their heads, while is below them. Morgan's initial "M" is on Coligny's shoulder. The reverse depicts the ship "Nieuw Nederlandt" and the words, with the years 1624 and 1924 to either side of the ship. Stoudt's sketch for the reverse was also used on the one cent denomination of the stamp set issued in conjunction with the tercentenary.

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> noted that the half dollar was probably one of Morgan's last works (he died in January 1925) and that the coin "is a worthy conclusion to Morgan's long career of distinguished and rich production, marked by imagination within the conservative framework and by a generally high level of appeal". Vermeule stated that the Huguenot-Walloon half dollar showed "that the die-engravers trained in and around the Mint did have the ability to combine clear-cut designs with considerable detail."

A total of 142,080 Huguenot-Walloon half dollars were struck at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> in February and April 1924, with 80 of those pieces retained for inspection and testing by the 1925 <a href="Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>. The Huguenot-Walloon commission, to boost sales, engaged as distributor the man they considered to be the most prominent numismatist in the country, Moritz Wormser, president of the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a> (ANA). Wormser's involvement, and the fact that Stoudt was an ANA member, led numismatist John F. Jones to deem this issue "the first instance we believe, where the coin fraternity has been consulted in the issue of a commemorative half dollar".

The coins were sold to the public for $1 each through the Fifth National Bank and other outlets. Bulk sales were made to certain groups. The coins did not sell as well as expected, and 55,000 were returned, after which they were placed in circulation. Relatively few are known in worn condition, causing author and coin dealer <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> to conclude the public picked them out of pocket change. Money from the Huguenot-Walloon half dollar was used towards a celebration in New York in May 1924, during which the National Huguenot Memorial Church on <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a> was dedicated. There was some debate in the pages of "<a href="The%20Numismatist">The Numismatist</a>", the ANA's journal, both as to whether William and Coligny should have appeared on the coin since they had nothing to do with the voyage, and whether the Churches of Christ should be allowed to sponsor a coin in view of the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment's</a> prohibition <a href="Establishment%20clause">of an establishment of religion</a>. There was controversy in the press, which criticized the inclusion of William and Coligny as irrelevant to the commemoration and as religious propaganda. This in 1925 made politically infeasible the attempts of Minnesota Representative <a href="Ole%20Juulson%20Kvale">Ole Juulson Kvale</a>, a Lutheran pastor, to obtain a coin for the <a href="Norse-American%20Centennial">Norse-American Centennial</a>; he instead settled for <a href="Norse-American%20medal">a congressionally authorized medal</a>.

Arlie R. Slabaugh, in his 1975 volume on commemoratives, noted that a uniface die trial of the reverse in brass was made. Swiatek in 2012 stated that both obverse and reverse die trials are known. The edition of <a href="R.%20S.%20Yeoman">R. S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" published in 2018 lists the half dollar at between $125 and $650 depending on condition; a near-pristine specimen sold for $15,275 in 2015.

Hawaii Sesquicentennial half dollar

The Hawaii Sesquicentennial half dollar was struck in 1928 by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> in honor of the 150th anniversary of Captain <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a>'s landing in <a href="Hawaiian%20Islands">Hawaii</a>, the <a href="Exploration%20of%20the%20Pacific%23European%20exploration">first European</a> to reach there. The coin depicts Captain Cook on the <a href="obverse">obverse</a> and a <a href="Ali%CA%BBi">Hawaiian chieftain</a> on the reverse. Only 10,000 were struck for the public, making the coin rare and valuable.

In 1927, the <a href="Hawaii%20State%20Legislature%23History">legislature</a> of the <a href="Territory%20of%20Hawaii">Territory of Hawaii</a> passed a resolution calling on the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. government</a> to produce a commemorative coin for the 150th anniversary of Cook's arrival in Hawaii. Treasury Secretary <a href="Andrew%20Mellon">Andrew Mellon</a> thought the occasion important enough that, unusually for him, he did not oppose such an issue. The bill for the Hawaii half dollar passed through <a href="70th%20United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> without opposition or amendment, and became the Act of March 7, 1928 with the signature of President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>.

Sculptor <a href="Chester%20Beach">Chester Beach</a> made the plaster models for the coins from sketches by <a href="Juliette%20May%20Fraser">Juliette May Fraser</a>. Beach had some trouble gaining approval for his designs, as there were issues raised by the Mint and by <a href="Victor%20Stewart%20Kaleoaloha%20Houston">Victor Stewart Kaleoaloha Houston</a>, Hawaii Territory's <a href="delegate%20to%20Congress">delegate to Congress</a>. These concerns were eventually addressed, and the coin went into production. Although the issue price, at $2, was the highest for a commemorative half dollar to that point, the coins sold out quickly and have risen in value to over a thousand dollars.

The Hawaii Sesquicentennial half dollar was proposed because of the observances there for the 150th anniversary of Captain <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a> becoming the first European to reach the <a href="Hawaiian%20Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a> or, as it was termed then, "its discovery". Planners decided on a date for the celebrations as August 1928, halfway between the sesquicentennial of <a href="Third%20voyage%20of%20James%20Cook%23Voyage">Cook's landing</a> in January 1778 and of <a href="Kidnapping%20of%20Kalani%CA%BB%C5%8Dpu%CA%BBu%20by%20Captain%20James%20Cook%23Death%20of%20Cook">his death</a> in the islands in February 1779. A resolution was passed by the legislature of the <a href="Territory%20of%20Hawaii">Territory of Hawaii</a> to give the celebrations official status, and to ask the federal government to have the armed forces participate. The resolution requested that Washington invite the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> (Cook's allegiance) and other nations. It also asked the federal government to issue a <a href="half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollar</a> and postage stamps in honor of the anniversary. At the time, commemoratives were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. In the case of the Hawaii half dollar, the Cook Sesquicentennial Commission of Hawaii was the designated group.

Bruce Cartwright, Jr. was in charge of choosing a coin design for the Cook commission. Mrs. Ethelwyn Castle, a civic-minded person, arranged for him to meet <a href="Juliette%20May%20Fraser">Juliette May Fraser</a>, a local artist. Cartwright had prepared cartoon-style drawings, with the portrait of Cook based on a <a href="Wedgwood">Wedgwood</a> plaque that had been owned by <a href="Emma%20of%20Hawaii">Queen Emma</a>, showing the explorer facing right. Within two days, Fraser had produced sketches. On November 2, Charles Moore, chairman of the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>, wrote to Assistant <a href="Director%20of%20the%20Mint">Director of the Mint</a> <a href="Mary%20M.%20O%27Reilly">Mary M. O'Reilly</a> that Juliette Fraser's sketches were excellent and would translate well into a coin.
The Commission of Fine Arts met and, at the suggestion of sculptor-member <a href="Lorado%20Taft">Lorado Taft</a>, decided to ask <a href="Buffalo%20nickel">Buffalo nickel</a> designer <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a> (no relation) who would be most suitable to turn the sketches into plaster models, from which the Mint could make coinage dies and <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23H">hubs</a>. James Fraser suggested <a href="Peace%20dollar">Peace dollar</a> designer <a href="Anthony%20de%20Francisci">Anthony de Francisci</a>, but sculptor <a href="Chester%20Beach">Chester Beach</a> was engaged instead.

Numismatic historian <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a> thought it likely that members of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Coinage%2C%20Weights%2C%20and%20Measures">House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures</a> had agreed to support a Hawaii half dollar prior to a bill being submitted, as preparations had already begun. Legislation for such was introduced into the House of Representatives by the territory's <a href="delegate%20to%20Congress">delegate to Congress</a>, <a href="Victor%20Stewart%20Kaleoaloha%20Houston">Victor Stewart Kaleoaloha Houston</a>, on December 5, 1927. It was referred to the coinage committee, of which New Jersey Congressman <a href="Randolph%20Perkins">Randolph Perkins</a> was the chair, and which held hearings on the bill on January 23, 1928. Delegate Houston appeared in support of his bill, and to the surprise of committee members, had gotten a statement from <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="Andrew%20Mellon">Andrew Mellon</a>, stating that Mellon did not oppose the bill. Usually, when a commemorative coin was proposed, Mellon argued that a medal should be issued instead. This had been the case for the <a href="Norse-American%20medal">Norse-American medal</a> three years previously; its sponsor, committee member <a href="Ole%20J.%20Kvale">Ole J. Kvale</a> of Minnesota, had scuttled plans for a coin because of Treasury Department opposition. Congressman Kvale was "very much interested in learning what powers of persuasion have been exercised by the gentleman from Hawaii to bring out such a favorable report". Kvale, a Norse-American, asked, "why this discrimination against two and a half million people in the United States has come about in favor of about 35,000 whites in that Territory?"

Houston stated he had not lobbied the Treasury for the coin, and Perkins, before promising to find out more information, speculated that perhaps it was because the coins were to be issued far from the continental United States. Houston told the committee that the coin was "something that may be kept by those who attend the celebration as a memorial of it and will be available to foreigners who come there, as well as our own people who celebrate the occasion". Kvale stated he would vote for the bill. Mississippi's <a href="Bill%20G.%20Lowrey">Bill G. Lowrey</a> noted that as he had said before, he would not vote for any coin bill; Perkins agreed that Lowrey had made his position clear. Perkins issued a report on February 1, 1928, recounting the history behind the proposed coin and indicating his committee's support.

The bill was passed without objection by the House of Representatives on February 20, 1928. The bill was received by the Senate the following day and was referred to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Banking%2C%20Housing%2C%20and%20Urban%20Affairs">Committee on Banking and Currency</a>. On February 27, South Dakota's <a href="Peter%20Norbeck">Peter Norbeck</a> reported the bill back to the Senate without amendment, and included in the report a letter from Secretary Mellon to Perkins dated February 13, in which Mellon expanded on his reasons for not opposing the Hawaii coin legislation. Mellon stated that only a token number of pieces would be issued, and that the celebration, sponsored by the territorial government, was of national significance.
The bill was passed by the Senate on March 2 without recorded opposition and was enacted on March 7 with the signature of President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>. It provided for the issuance of up to 10,000 half dollars in honor of the sesquicentennial, with the commission's profits from the coin to be used toward establishing a Captain James Cook collection in the territorial archives.

Once Beach accepted the commission on March 12, 1928, Juliette Fraser's sketches were forwarded to him. On April 7, he sent completed models to the Mint and photographs to the Fine Arts Commission. Both the Mint and Houston responded with criticism, the former that the <a href="relief">relief</a> of the coin was high and difficult to <a href="reducing%20lathe">reduce</a> to coin-sized hubs. On April 19, Mint Chief Engraver <a href="John%20R.%20Sinnock">John R. Sinnock</a> wrote in a memorandum that the coin would be very hard to produce because the area of greatest relief on each side was in the same part of the design. Beach agreed to lower any high points that might cause the Mint difficulty.

Delegate Houston had a long list of quibbles about the coin's design. For example, Beach had placed an anklet on the chief's leg; Houston felt such an item would not have been worn. Beach defended some of his choices, such as the anklet (which was removed when Houston insisted), and promised to comply with the remainder. This did not satisfy Houston, who was also unhappy about the shape of the palm tree on the coin, and Beach modified the design again. Beach forwarded final models, indicating that he would only consider making changes if the Mint requested it. He wrote to Moore, "I think the proper thing for Mr. Houston to do would be to take the sculptor and family to Hawaii and let us live in the cocoanut trees for a while and absorb the atmosphere of that paradise."

The coin was endorsed by the Commission of Fine Arts; on May 9, O'Reilly wrote to Beach that the design had received Secretary Mellon's approval.

The <a href="obverse">obverse</a> depicts Captain James Cook. He faces towards a compass needle and the words thus, his gaze is westward. is to the right, the name of the country above, and the denomination below. The words are flanked by eight triangles, four on each side. These represent the eight largest volcanic islands of Hawaii: <a href="Oahu">Oahu</a>, <a href="Maui">Maui</a>, <a href="Kauai">Kauai</a>, the "Big Island" of <a href="Hawai%27i%20%28island%29">Hawaii</a>, <a href="Niihau">Niihau</a>, <a href="Lanai">Lanai</a>, <a href="Kahoolawe">Kahoolawe</a>, and <a href="Molokai">Molokai</a>. The designer's initials, , are found to the right of the base of the bust.

The reverse is based on a <a href="Kamehameha%20statues">statue</a> of King <a href="Kamehameha%20I%20of%20Hawaii">Kamehameha I of Hawaii</a>, designed by <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Gould">Thomas R. Gould</a>, and intended "to symbolize the past and future glory of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii">Kingdom of Hawaii</a>". <a href="Kamehameha%20Statue%20%28Honolulu%20cast%29">The sculpture</a> that stands in downtown <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a> (1883) is a replacement for one that sank while being transported from <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a>; <a href="Kamehameha%20Statue%20%28original%20cast%29">the original</a> (1880) was later salvaged and stands at <a href="Kohala%2C%20Hawaii">Kohala</a> on the island of <a href="Hawaii%20%28island%29">Hawaii</a>. The coin features a Hawaiian chieftain in ceremonial dress surmounting the top of a hill, with his arm extended in greeting. He represents Hawaii rising from obscurity. The palm tree that rises above him is intended to signify romance. A Hawaiian village at <a href="Waikiki%20Beach">Waikiki Beach</a> with <a href="Diamond%20Head%2C%20Hawaii">Diamond Head</a> nearby are seen behind him, representing history and antiquity. The design is almost free of lettering, with only "" ("Out of many, one") and to be seen. Ferns are visible under that Latin motto: Houston wanted the plants removed, but Beach insisted on retaining them to balance the design. Juliette Fraser had made a number of sketches, all with the same basic design elements, but with the chieftain in various poses and with Diamond Head in different positions.

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, in his volume on U.S. coins and medals, wrote that the obverse "is too crowded, despite the large, flat, clothed bust" and that the various elements of the reverse design "are all too much for one small coin". He deemed "the coin honoring Hawaii in 1928 ... no more a credit to Chester Beach than was the <a href="Lexington-Concord%20half%20dollar">Lexington Concord coin</a> [of 1925]".

The <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> coined 10,008 Hawaii Sesquicentennial half dollars in June 1928, with the eight pieces above the authorized mintage reserved for inspection and testing at the 1929 meeting of the annual <a href="Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>. Fifty of the ten thousand were specially finished as sandblast <a href="proof%20pieces">proof pieces</a>, to be presented to various individuals and institutions, such as members of the Cook commission, President Coolidge, and the British <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a>. Of the remainder, half were to be sold on the Hawaiian Islands, half reserved for orders from elsewhere. The <a href="Bank%20of%20Hawaii">Bank of Hawaii</a> took charge of distribution on behalf of the Cook commission. The price was $2 per coin, the highest for a half dollar commemorative to that point.

Sales began October 8, 1928; supplies were quickly exhausted. Numismatists Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, in their book on commemoratives, write that while "there was never any scandal about these coins", there were unconfirmed rumors of hoards of coins, totaling as many as 1,500, taken from the allocation for Hawaiians and kept off the market. One such grouping, of 137 pieces, comprised coins from an allotment for the Bank of Hawaii for sale to its employees. When the coin the bank put on display was stolen, the bank president took the others off sale, and they remained in the vaults until 1986, when they were sold at auction. Many Hawaii Sesquicentennial half dollars were purchased by non-collectors and display the effects of poor handling.

The Captain Cook Memorial Collection, purchased in part with funds raised from the coins, is now in the <a href="Bishop%20Museum">Bishop Museum</a> in Honolulu. The Hawaii Sesquicentennial coin is the scarcest commemorative half dollar by design; according to <a href="R.S.%20Yeoman">R.S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" published in 2015, it lists for between $1,850 and $11,000 depending on condition. The sandblast proofs are listed for up to $50,000 but none has recently been sold at auction—an exceptional specimen of the regular type sold for $25,850 in 2013. At least three different counterfeits are known.

Migration of the Serbs

Seoba Srba (English: Migration of the Serbs) is a set of four similar <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a>s by the <a href="Serbian%20art">Serbian art</a>ist <a href="Paja%20Jovanovi%C4%87">Paja Jovanović</a> that depict <a href="Serbs">Serbs</a>, led by <a href="List%20of%20heads%20of%20the%20Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church">Archbishop</a> <a href="Arsenije%20III%20%C4%8Carnojevi%C4%87">Arsenije III</a>, fleeing <a href="Old%20Serbia">Old Serbia</a> during the <a href="Great%20Migrations%20of%20the%20Serbs">Great Serb Migration</a> of 1690–91. The first was commissioned in 1895 by <a href="Georgije%20Brankovi%C4%87">Georgije Branković</a>, the <a href="Patriarchate%20of%20Karlovci">Patriarch of Karlovci</a>, to be displayed at the following year's <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a> Millennium Exhibition. In the view of the Serbian clergy, it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland at the behest of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> to protect the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg Monarchy</a>'s borders.

Measuring , the first painting was completed in <a href="1896%20in%20art">1896</a>, and presented to Patriarch Georgije later that year. Dissatisfied, the Patriarch asked Jovanović to adjust his work to conform with the Church's view of the migration. Though Jovanović made the changes relatively quickly, he could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest, and it therefore had to be unveiled at the Archbishop's palace in <a href="Sremski%20Karlovci">Sremski Karlovci</a>. Jovanović went on to complete a total of four versions of the painting, three of which survive. The first version is on display at the patriarchate building of the <a href="Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church">Serbian Orthodox Church</a> in <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, the second at the <a href="Pan%C4%8Devo">Pančevo</a> Museum, and the fourth at <a href="Princess%20Ljubica%27s%20Residence">Princess Ljubica's Residence</a>, in Belgrade. "Migration of the Serbs" holds iconic status in Serbian popular culture, and several authors repute it to be one of Jovanović's finest achievements.

In 1689, <a href="Arsenije%20III%20%C4%8Carnojevi%C4%87">Arsenije III</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20heads%20of%20the%20Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church">Archbishop of Peć</a>, incited <a href="Serbs">Serbs</a> in Kosovo, <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a> and the <a href="Sand%C5%BEak">Sandžak</a> to revolt against the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and support a <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg</a> incursion into the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>. On 2 January 1690, the Habsburgs and Serbs were defeated in battle at the <a href="Ka%C3%A7anik%20Gorge">Kačanik Gorge</a>. The Habsburgs began to retreat, prompting thousands of Serb villagers to leave their homes and flee north fearing Ottoman reprisals. In Serbian historiography, this event came to be known as the <a href="Great%20Migration%20of%20the%20Serbs">Great Serb Migration</a>. Between 30,000 and 40,000 Serb refugees streamed into Habsburg-held <a href="Vojvodina">Vojvodina</a>, north of the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> River, and settled there. The migrants would come to call the regions they had formerly inhabited <a href="Old%20Serbia">Old Serbia</a>, and dubbed their adopted homeland "new Serbia". <a href="Tim%20Judah">Tim Judah</a>, a journalist specializing in the Balkans, describes the exodus as one of the most traumatic events in Serbian history.

In 1691, Arsenije struck a deal with <a href="Leopold%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Leopold I</a>, who was <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> and <a href="King%20of%20Hungary">King of Hungary</a>, whereby the Habsburgs granted the Serbs <a href="East%E2%80%93West%20Schism%23Ecclesiological%20disputes">ecclesiastic autonomy</a> and some degree of self-administration, much to the displeasure of the Roman Catholic Church and Hungarian authorities. Leopold recognized Arsenije as the leader of Habsburg Serbs in both religious and secular affairs, and indicated that this power would be held by all future Archbishops. In 1712, <a href="Sremski%20Karlovci">Sremski Karlovci</a> became the Patriarchate for Serbs living in the Habsburg Empire.

In the early 1890s, Hungarian officials announced plans for a Budapest Millennium Exhibition to be held in 1896; it was intended to mark the 1,000th anniversary of the <a href="Hungarian%20conquest%20of%20the%20Carpathian%20Basin">Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin</a>, reaffirm Hungary's "national and territorial legitimacy" and the Hungarian people's "natural and historical right in the areas they inhabited." The Exhibition was to be held at Budapest's <a href="City%20Park%20%28Budapest%29">City Park</a>. Exhibits were to be divided into twelve distinct areas, one of which was visual art. The showpiece of the art exhibit was "<a href="The%20Conquest%20of%20the%20Carpathian%20Basin">The Conquest of the Carpathian Basin</a>", a painting by Hungary's foremost <a href="history%20painting">history painter</a>, <a href="Mih%C3%A1ly%20Munk%C3%A1csy">Mihály Munkácsy</a>, that was located in the <a href="Hungarian%20Parliament%20Building">Hungarian Parliament Building</a>. Several pavilions displaying the cultural and industrial achievements of non-Hungarians living in the Hungarian-administered territories of <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> were also built, including one for the Serbs.

In the spring of 1895, on the orders of the <a href="Patriarchate%20of%20Karlovci">Patriarch of Karlovci</a>, <a href="Georgije%20Brankovi%C4%87">Georgije I</a>, the Congress Board of Sremski Karlovci commissioned the young <a href="Realism%20%28art%20movement%29">realist</a> <a href="Paja%20Jovanovi%C4%87">Paja Jovanović</a> to paint "Migration of the Serbs", intending for it to be displayed as part of the Serb pavilion. Georgije had originally approached the artist <a href="Uro%C5%A1%20Predi%C4%87">Uroš Predić</a>, but Predić said it would take him two years to complete the painting. Jovanović assured the Patriarch that he could finish the work in eight months. The painting was one of two works that Jovanović was hired to paint for the Exhibition, the other being the "<a href="Vr%C5%A1ac%20triptych">Vršac triptych</a>", which was commissioned by the Vršac city council.

In the eyes of the clergy, "Migration of the Serbs" would help legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary. The official Church narrative held that Leopold had requested that the Serbs of Kosovo, Macedonia and the Sandžak settle along the Ottoman–Habsburg frontier to create a buffer against further Ottoman encroachment, and Church officials intended for Jovanović's painting to reflect this view. Hence, the painting had significant political implications. Habsburg Serbs asserted that the agreement between Arsenije and Leopold legitimized their claim to the lands they inhabited. <a href="Croatian%20nationalism">Croatian nationalists</a> decried the Serbs as "uninvited guests" who only acquired Leopold's pledge of autonomy after they had migrated to the Habsburg lands. "Migration of the Serbs" was thus intended to challenge the historical and political narratives being forwarded by the Croatian and Hungarian painters whose works were also going to be displayed.

The commission offered Jovanović the opportunity to make a name for himself as a serious history painter, given that the subject of the work was an event of international significance and the painting was to be displayed in a foreign capital. To ensure "Migration of the Serbs" was historically accurate, Jovanović studied authentic medieval weapons, costumes and other objects, later incorporating them into the composition. He also studied medieval histories, collected <a href="Ethnography">ethnographical</a> evidence and consulted historians. Notably, the Church asked the historian and Orthodox priest <a href="Ilarion%20Ruvarac">Ilarion Ruvarac</a> to consult Jovanović on the historical details of the migration and accompany him on a visit to the monasteries of <a href="Fru%C5%A1ka%20Gora">Fruška Gora</a>, where the young artist examined a number of contemporary sources and objects from the time.

The <a href="Art%20history">art historian</a> Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson notes that Jovanović incorporated modern techniques into the work and emulated the <a href="Realism%20%28arts%29">naturalistic</a> approach of contemporary landscape painters, showing he was "at ease with the art of the past and that of his own time". The composition marked a significant departure for Jovanović, who up until that point had painted mostly <a href="Orientalism">Orientalist</a> pieces as opposed to ones that depicted specific moments from Serbian history.

The original <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> measures . It depicts Arsenije leading tens of thousands of Serbs into exile, riding a horse and flanked by a <a href="List%20of%20Serbian%20flags">Serb flag</a>. In direct reference to the Bible, the image is reminiscent to that of <a href="Moses">Moses</a> leading the <a href="Jews%20as%20the%20chosen%20people">chosen people</a> <a href="The%20Exodus">out of Egypt</a>. The irony, Judah notes, is that the Patriarch is leading his people away from their promised land. The Patriarch and four other figures dominate the composition, staggering unevenly across the canvas as opposed to moving in a straight line. "They punctuate the foreground," Filipovitch-Robinson writes, "directing the eye through the diagonals and curves of their bodies and gesture to the next line of figures behind them. Each subsequent line leads to the next." All age groups are represented in the painting, and Jovanović pays special attention to their facial details. Thousands of figures on horseback and on foot appear in the background before eventually receding into the horizon. The left background shows Serbian warriors pointing their lances at the sky while the right background shows lumber wagons carrying families into exile. At the right foreground, an old man herds his sheep. To the right of the Patriarch, a mother and her infant son sit atop a horse carrying their belongings. The woman is the young wife of militia leader <a href="Jovan%20Monasterlija">Jovan Monasterlija</a> and the child his son. A mustachioed warrior walks before them with swords fastened to his belt and a rifle resting against his shoulder, "striding purposefully into the future". The warrior's right arm is smeared with blood and bound by a white sling.

Upon first seeing it, Georgije was displeased by Jovanović's depiction of the exodus, particularly the sight of sheep and wagons carrying women and children, saying it made the migrants look like "rabble on the run". The source of the Patriarch's displeasure lay in differing interpretations of what had originally caused the migration to take place; the Church maintained that Arsenije was simply heeding the call of the Holy Roman Emperor to head north. Having studied Ruvarac's work, Jovanović came to hold the view that fear of Ottoman persecution, rather than the desire to protect the Habsburg frontier, had prompted the migrants to leave their homes. Jovanović duly took the painting back to his studio and altered it to the Patriarch's liking, removing the sheep, lumber wagons, and the woman and her infant son, putting stylized warriors in their place. He also placed the letter Leopold had supposedly sent the Serbs inviting them to settle Vojvodina in the hand of , a priest riding beside Arsenije. Although these changes were made relatively quickly, Jovanović could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest. Hence, only the "Vršac triptych" was displayed at the Millennium Exhibition.

"Migration of the Serbs" was unveiled at the Archbishop's palace in Sremski Karlovci in 1896. It was kept there until 1941, when <a href="Usta%C5%A1e">Ustaše</a> fascists looted the palace and stole it, cut it out of its frame and took it to <a href="Zagreb">Zagreb</a>, where it remained until the end of the war. After the war, the painting was returned to Serbia, briefly put on display at Belgrade's <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Serbia">National Museum</a>, and then given back to the <a href="Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church">Serbian Orthodox Church</a>. It was ultimately put on display at the patriarchate building in Belgrade, where it remains. It began undergoing restoration in 2004.

While working on the copy that the Patriarch had commissioned, Jovanović began a second version of the painting, one that retained the woman and her child, the herd of sheep and the wagons carrying refugees. This, Filipovitch-Robinson asserts, is indicative of "Jovanović's firmness of conviction and artistic integrity." The second version was smaller than the first, measuring . Like the first, it was completed in 1896, and came to be called the "<a href="Pan%C4%8Devo">Pančevo</a> version" as it was acquired by the Pančevo Museum in the 1970s. Shortly after its completion, the rights to the Pančevo version were purchased by Zagreb art collector Petar Nikolić, who secured the right to publish <a href="Lithography">lithographic</a> reproductions of the painting for the next fifty years. Such prints became quite popular, and could be found in Serb homes up to the end of the 20th century. As the Pančevo version was the first to be lithographically reproduced, it became the best known rendition. It was displayed at the 1900 "<a href="Exposition%20Universelle%20%281900%29">Exposition Universelle</a>" (<a href="world%27s%20fair">world's fair</a>) in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>.

At the height of World War II, Jovanović created a third version on behalf of a Belgrade physician named Darinka Smodlaka, who requested that the figure of Monasterlija's wife bear her likeness. This version measured . Its current whereabouts are unknown, and it is presumed lost. In 1945, as the war neared its end, a wealthy Serbian merchant named Milenko Čavić commissioned a fourth and final version, incorrectly assuming that the others had been destroyed in the fighting. Čavić gifted the painting to the Mandukić family at the war's end. They emigrated to the United States following the <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">communist takeover</a> of <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> in 1945, and took it with them to New York. This version was returned to Belgrade in 2009, and is currently on display at <a href="Princess%20Ljubica%27s%20Residence">Princess Ljubica's Residence</a>. It measures .

The painting was well-received in Serbia and abroad; it has since attained iconic status in Serbian popular culture. An allusion to it is made in <a href="Emir%20Kusturica">Emir Kusturica</a>'s 1995 film "<a href="Underground%20%281995%20film%29">Underground</a>", in which war refugees are depicted marching towards Belgrade in similar fashion, following the German <a href="Operation%20Retribution%20%281941%29">bombing</a> of the city in April 1941. Several authors have noted similarities between Jovanović's depiction of the migration and images of other upheavals in Serbian history. Historian Katarina Todić observes that there are striking similarities between the painting and photographs of the <a href="Royal%20Serbian%20Army">Royal Serbian Army</a>'s <a href="Serbian%20army%27s%20retreat%20through%20Albania">retreat</a> to the Adriatic coast during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Judah remarks that the composition resembles images of the exodus of Krajina Serbs following <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>'s <a href="Operation%20Storm">Operation Storm</a> in August 1995.

The journalist <a href="John%20Kifner">John Kifner</a> describes "Migration of the Serbs" as a "Balkan equivalent to "<a href="Washington%20Crossing%20the%20Delaware%20%281851%20painting%29">Washington Crossing the Delaware</a>" ... an instantly recognizable [icon] of the 500-year struggle against the Ottoman Turks." Professor David A. Norris, a historian specializing in Serbian culture, calls Jovanović's approach "highly effective", and writes how the stoic attitude of the priests, warriors and peasants reminds the viewer of the historical significance of the migration. He asserts that "Migration of the Serbs" and similar paintings stimulated a "revived <a href="collective%20memory">collective memory</a>" among the new Serbian <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a>, "transforming ... folk memory into a more modern vehicle for the invention of a new national ideology based on the Serbian struggle for freedom from foreign domination." Art historian Michele Facos describes the painting as a celebration of the Serbs' "valiant effort to defend Christian Europe against ... the Ottoman Turks." The historian <a href="Noel%20Malcolm">Noel Malcolm</a> doubts the historical veracity of depictions of Arsenije leading vast columns of refugees, saying that there is no concrete evidence to confirm or deny that the number of migrants exceeded 40,000, as Church leaders claimed.

Filipovitch-Robinson ranks the painting among Jovanović's three best works, alongside "<a href="The%20Takovo%20Uprising">The Takovo Uprising</a>" (1894) and "<a href="The%20Proclamation%20of%20Du%C5%A1an%27s%20Law%20Codex">The Proclamation of Dušan's Law Codex</a>" (1900). This view is shared by the art historian Jelena Milojković-Djurić, as well as Judah. Filipovitch-Robinson praises Jovanović's "uncompromising realism" and commends his portrayal of the migrants. She writes that the Pančevo version "validates Jovanović as an insightful commentator on ... Balkan history", and is indicative of "the methodology and technical skill which had already brought him international acclaim." Jovanović "persuades the viewer of the believability and authenticity of the event," she writes. "He captures the determination, strength, and dignity of a people. [...] Regardless of the reasons for this migration, they move forward in unison to meet the hard challenges of an unknown land."

Imleria badia

Imleria badia, <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the bay bolete, is an <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>, <a href="pored%20mushroom">pored mushroom</a> found in Europe and North America, where it grows in <a href="Temperate%20coniferous%20forest">coniferous</a> or <a href="mixed%20wood">mixed wood</a>s on the ground or on decaying tree stumps, sometimes in prolific numbers. Both the common and scientific names refer to the <a href="bay%20%28color%29">bay</a>- or <a href="chestnut%20%28color%29">chestnut</a>-coloured <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a>, which is almost spherical in young specimens before broadening and flattening out to a diameter up to . On the cap underside are small yellowish pores that turn dull blue-grey when bruised. The smooth, cylindrical <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>, measuring long by thick, is coloured like the cap, but paler. Some <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a> have been described from eastern North America, differing from the main type in both macroscopic and microscopic <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>.

First described scientifically by <a href="Elias%20Fries">Elias Fries</a> in 1818, the bay bolete was reclassified as Xerocomus badius in 1931, and it is still listed thus in several sources. Modern <a href="molecular%20phylogenetic">molecular phylogenetic</a> studies show "<a href="Xerocomus">Xerocomus</a>" to be <a href="polyphyletic">polyphyletic</a> (not descended from a <a href="common%20ancestor">common ancestor</a>), and the bay bolete is not particularly closely related to species in that genus. Often considered a poor relation of the cep ("<a href="Boletus%20edulis">Boletus edulis</a>"), "I. badia" is nevertheless regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors, such as food expert <a href="Antonio%20Carluccio">Antonio Carluccio</a>, and is sold in markets in Europe and central Mexico. Its mushrooms are less often infested by maggots than other boletes. Several European studies have demonstrated that the mushroom can <a href="bioaccumulate">bioaccumulate</a> some <a href="trace%20metal">trace metal</a>s from the soil, such as <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>, <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a>, and <a href="nickel">nickel</a>. Additionally, the mushroom contains a <a href="pigment">pigment</a> that concentrates radioactive <a href="caesium">caesium</a>; specimens collected in Europe following the 1986 <a href="Chernobyl%20disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a> contained several times more <a href="caesium-137">caesium-137</a> than those collected before the incident.

The bay bolete was first named as "Boletus castaneus" ß "badius" (i.e. a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of "<a href="Gyroporus%20castaneus">Boletus castaneus</a>") by <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a> in 1818. Fries later renamed it as a <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> of "Boletus castaneus" in 1828, before assigning it distinct species status in his 1832 work "Elenchus Fungorum". The fungus has been transferred to several genera in its <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> history: "Rostkovites" by <a href="Petter%20Karsten">Petter Karsten</a> in 1881; "Viscipellis" and "Ixocomus" by <a href="Lucien%20Qu%C3%A9let">Lucien Quélet</a> in 1886 and 1888, respectively; and "<a href="Suillus">Suillus</a>" by <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> in 1898. In 1931, <a href="Edouard-Jean%20Gilbert">Edouard-Jean Gilbert</a> reclassified it in the genus "<a href="Xerocomus">Xerocomus</a>", and many sources still list it thus. Review of "Xerocomus" strongly suggested it was <a href="polyphyletic">polyphyletic</a>, and the genus was not accepted by some mycologists. The stickiness of its wet cap distinguishes the species from others classified in "Xerocomus", and hence it was left in "<a href="Boletus">Boletus</a>" until Alfredo Vizzini placed it in its own genus in 2014. Genetic analysis published in 2013 shows that "Imleria badia" is related to "<a href="Boletus%20pallidus">B. pallidus</a>" and "<a href="Boletus%20glabellus">B. glabellus</a>"; the three species form a <a href="clade">clade</a> known informally as the "badius" clade within a larger group (informally called anaxoboletus) in the suborder <a href="Boletineae">Boletineae</a>. Other clades within the group include the "<a href="Tylopilus">Tylopilus</a>", <a href="Boletus%20edulis">porcini</a> (= "Boletus" <a href="Sensu%23Common%20qualifiers">"sensu stricto"</a>) and "<a href="Strobilomyces">Strobilomyces</a>" clades, as well as two other groups composed of members of various genera including "Xerocomus" (the taxa designated as "Xerocomus" species in this clade are not "Xerocomus" species and require new taxonomic designations) and "<a href="Xerocomellus">Xerocomellus</a>".

The species "Boletus limatulus", originally published by <a href="Charles%20Christopher%20Frost">Charles Christopher Frost</a> in 1874, was later redescribed, "with a slight tinge of irritation at the time, energy and gasoline spent", as a variety of "I. badia" by <a href="Wally%20Snell">Wally Snell</a> in 1945 (as "Xerocomus badius" var. "limatulus"). The <a href="taxon">taxon</a> name comes from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "limatulus", "rather polished" or "refined". Varieties "glaber" and "macrostipitatus" were described from <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, Canada, in 1976.

The starting date of fungal taxonomy had been set as January 1, 1821, to coincide with the date of the works of Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries, the "father of mycology". <a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a> argued that setting the starting date earlier to <a href="Christiaan%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christiaan Persoon's</a> 1801 publication of "Synopsis" would make a name change necessary, as he had originally given what is now known as "<a href="Royoporus%20badius">Royoporus badius</a>" the combination "Boletus badius" Pers. and if the bay bolete was classified in the genus "Boletus", the name would be unavailable and the names "Boletus glutinosus" <a href="Julius%20Vincenz%20von%20Krombholz">Krombh.</a> or "B. spadiceus" Krombh. (non Fr.) would have to be used instead.

The <a href="botanical%20name">species name</a> is the Latin adjective "badia", meaning "chestnut brown". The <a href="common%20name">common name</a> is likewise derived from the colour of the cap, likened to the coat of a <a href="Bay%20%28horse%29">bay horse</a>. Alternate common names of a similar derivation include bay-brown bolete and bay-capped bolete, and it is known as "bolet bai" in French. It is also known as the "false cep". Variety "glaber" was named for its smooth (Latin: "glaber", "without hairs") stipe, and "macrostipitatus" for its large (Latin: "macro", "large") stipe.

"Imleria badia" fruit bodies have a <a href="chestnut%20%28color%29">chestnut</a> to dark brown <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a>, which is almost spherical in young specimens before broadening and flattening out to a diameter of up to . The cap margin is acute, and cap surface velvety when young and slightly sticky when wet or old. The <a href="cap%20cuticle">cap cuticle</a> is difficult to separate from the <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> underneath. On the cap undersurface, the pores are initially cream to pale yellow, but become greenish yellow or olive with age. They stain dull blue to bluish-grey when bruised or cut, and are easily removed from the flesh. The pores are initially circular, becoming more angular with age, and number about one or two per millimetre. The tubes are long, and are <a href="adnation">adnate</a> to depressed around the area of attachment to the <a href="Stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>.

The flesh is mostly whitish or yellowish in some places; underneath the cap cuticle, it is brownish-pink or reddish brown. Initially firm, it begins to soften under the cap in older mushrooms. In some parts of the cap, such as the junction of the cap and the stipe, the flesh stains pale blue when injured or exposed to air, particularly in damp weather. This change is sometimes faint, and not persistent, as it eventually reverts to its original colour. The stipe is long by thick, and is similar in colour to the cap but paler, and sometimes with a rose-coloured tinge. Its surface has faint longitudinal ridges, a fine powdering, and fine reticulations (a net-like pattern of ridges) at the apex. It often has a whitish region at the base and the top, and white <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a> at the base. Unlike the bulbous stipe of many other boletes, the stipe of "B. badius" remains relatively slim and cylindrical. The flesh of the stipe gets tougher with age. Its smell has been described as fruity.

The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is olive to olive-brown. The smooth <a href="spore">spore</a>s are somewhat oblong to slightly ventricose (fattened in the middle), and measure 10–14 by 4–5 µm. The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 25–35 by 8–10 µm. Pleurocystidia (<a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> found on the faces of the tubes) are fuse-shaped and <a href="ventricose">ventricose</a>, with dimensions of 50–60 by 10–14 µm.

Variety "B. b. macrostipitatus" differs from the main form by its grey-orange cap, shorter stipe measuring , longer spores (15–18 by 4–5 µm), and longer pleurocystidia (30–55 by 10–14 µm). The variety "B. b. glaber" has a smooth (<a href="wikt%3Aglabrous">glabrous</a>) stipe, and smaller pleurocystidia (35–40 by 10–15 µm) and <a href="cystidium">cheilocystidia</a> (25–30 by 9–12 µm).

Several <a href="Chemical%20tests%20in%20mushroom%20identification">chemical tests</a> can be used to help identify the mushroom. A drop of <a href="ammonium%20hydroxide">ammonium hydroxide</a> solution turns the cap cuticle a greenish to bluish colour. Application of <a href="iron%28II%29%20sulfate">iron(II) sulphate</a> solution causes the flesh to stain a dull bluish-green, while the pores turn golden brown with a drop of dilute <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a>.

The similar colouration may cause confusion with "<a href="Boletus%20projectellus">Boletus projectellus</a>", but the latter species is usually more robust, and has a reticulated stipe. Additionally, "B. projectellus" has the largest spores in the Boletaceae, up to about 30 µm in diameter. Another lookalike is "<a href="Austroboletus%20gracilis">Austroboletus gracilis</a>", but this species does not have a blue bruising reaction, and its pore surface is initially white before turning pinkish. Compared to "I. badia", "<a href="Boletus%20subtomentosus">B. subtomentosus</a>" fruit bodies have narrower stipes, paler brown, dry caps, and wider pores that do not stain blue on bruising. This latter species is not as good to eat. In western North America, "I. badia" is replaced by the similar "<a href="Boletus%20zelleri">B. zelleri</a>", which also grows both on the ground and on rotten wood. The European species "<a href="Xerocomus%20bubalinus">Xerocomus bubalinus</a>" can be mistaken for "I. badia", but it has a paler yellow-brown cap flushed with pinkish-red, and is not sticky when wet.

Although the bay bolete is predominantly a <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l species, it does have some <a href="saprophytic">saprophytic</a> tendencies and may be able to use this lifestyle in certain circumstances. The <a href="ectomycorrhiza">ectomycorrhiza</a>e formed between "I. badia" and <a href="spruce">spruce</a> ("Picea abies") have active hyphal sheaths and a higher potential to store <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, <a href="iron">iron</a>, and <a href="zinc">zinc</a> than other mycorrhizal types, indicating the fungus is well adapted to acidic stands and its mycorrhizae are very efficient in uptake and storage of <a href="macronutrient">macronutrient</a>s. Mycorrhizae with <a href="Monterey%20pine">Monterey pine</a> ("Pinus radiata") have also been described.

The bay bolete is common in <a href="coniferous%20forest">coniferous</a> and less commonly <a href="mixed%20forest">mixed woodlands</a> in Europe, from the British Isles, where it is abundant throughout from August to November, east to the <a href="Black%20Sea%20Region">Black Sea Region</a> in Turkey. In Asia, the species has been recorded from Jordan mainland China, and Taiwan. The North American distribution extends from eastern Canada west to <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> and south to <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, where the mushroom fruits from July to November. It also grows in central Mexico. The variety "B. b. macrostipitatus" is found from eastern Canada south to <a href="Maine">Maine</a> and <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York state</a>, while variety "B. b. glaber" is known from the <a href="Atlantic%20Maritime%20Ecozone%20%28CEC%29">Atlantic Maritime Ecozone</a> of eastern Canada. Fruit bodies appear singly or scattered on the ground, or on decaying tree stumps, and can be well hidden by pine needles and ferns. Fruiting tends to peak three or four days after rain during warm weather. They can be prolific, especially in <a href="highland">highland</a> areas that are humid and shady. It is commonly found under <a href="List%20of%20Pinus%20species">white pine</a>, spruce, and <a href="Tsuga">hemlock</a>, and also occurs under deciduous trees, especially <a href="beech">beech</a>. It can also occur in grassy or mossy areas at or near forest margins; Italian restaurateur and cook <a href="Antonio%20Carluccio">Antonio Carluccio</a> recalled picking them in the grounds of <a href="Blenheim%20Palace">Blenheim Palace</a>. It does not occur on <a href="Calcareous%23Calcareous%20soils">calcareous</a> (chalky) soils.

"I. badia" fruit bodies are less affected by insects than other boletes. <a href="Oribatida">Orbatid mites</a> such as "<a href="Carabodes%20femoralis">Carabodes femoralis</a>", "<a href="Nothrus%20silvestris">Nothrus silvestris</a>" and "<a href="Oribatula%20tibialis">Oribatula tibialis</a>" eat them, as do squirrels. Several microbial pathogens can damage the fruit bodies, and have had an effect on populations in China, including soft rot caused by "<a href="Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a>", and black mould caused by "<a href="Mucor">Mucor</a>", "<a href="Sepedonium">Sepedonium</a>", "<a href="Paecilomyces">Paecilomyces</a>", and "<a href="Diasporangium">Diasporangium</a>" species.

Often considered a poor relation of the cep ("<a href="Boletus%20edulis">Boletus edulis</a>"), the bay bolete is nevertheless highly regarded as a choice <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible mushroom</a> by some authors such as Carluccio. In central Mexico, it is collected from <a href="Izta-Popo%20Zoquiapan%20National%20Park">Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park</a> and sold in neighbouring markets. It may cause an allergic reaction in some people, and the blue discolouration upon bruising can be offputting, although the staining disappears from white flesh when it is cooked. The flavour is milder than its better-known relative. Younger specimens are best for eating, though more mature ones can be suitable for cutting up and drying. The tendency for the pores to absorb water means that wiping rather than washing is recommended before use in the kitchen. Unlike most boletes, "I. badia" can be eaten raw (though only young mushrooms should be used). Otherwise it can be fried in butter, or used with meat or fish recipes. Mushrooms can also be frozen, dried, or <a href="pickling">pickled</a> in <a href="cider%20vinegar">cider vinegar</a>, wine, or extra virgin olive oil, and later used in sauces or soups.

The fruit bodies can be used to make <a href="mushroom%20dye">mushroom dye</a>s. Depending on the <a href="mordant">mordant</a> used, colours ranging from yellow, orange, gold, and green-brown can be obtained. Without mordant, a yellow colour is produced.

In laboratory experiments, <a href="extract">extract</a>s of "I. badia" fruit bodies have been shown to have significant <a href="antioxidant">antioxidative</a> properties "<a href="in%20vitro">in vitro</a>". Fruit bodies contain the compound <a href="theanine">theanine</a>, an <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> and a <a href="glutamic%20acid">glutamic acid</a> analogue found in <a href="green%20tea">green tea</a>. Efforts have been made to establish a protocol for producing theanine by growing the fungus mycelium using submerged <a href="Fermentation%20%28biochemistry%29">fermentation</a>. Several <a href="indole">indole</a> compounds have been detected in fruit bodies. Unprocessed mushrooms contain <a href="tryptophan">tryptophan</a> (0.68 mg per 100 g <a href="dry%20matter">dry weight</a>), <a href="tryptamine">tryptamine</a> (0.47), <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a> (0.52), <a href="kynurenine">kynurenine</a> sulphate (1.96), and <a href="kynurenic%20acid">kynurenic acid</a> (1.57). Due to their temperature sensitivity, cooking significantly changes the contents and composition of indole compounds: cooked mushrooms contained tryptophan (1.74 mg/100 g dw), 5-<a href="methyltryptophan">methyltryptophan</a> (6.55), <a href="melatonin">melatonin</a> (0.71), and <a href="indoleacetonitrile">indoleacetonitrile</a> (2.07). Fruit body extracts have been shown to slow the growth of certain tumour cell lines in <a href="cell%20culture">cell culture</a>.

Polish studies found that although the mushroom bioaccumulates <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> and <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a> from the soil, occasional consumption of mushrooms should not cause maximum allowable intake doses to be exceeded. Similar conclusions about safety were made in a Polish study of the mushroom's ability to accumulate <a href="organochlorine">organochlorine</a> compounds. Different methods of preparation for consumption affect the leaching rate of <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a>, <a href="lead">lead</a>, and mercury. After the 1986 <a href="Chernobyl%20disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a>, several studies showed "I. badia" bioaccumulates radioactive caesium, <a href="Isotopes%20of%20caesium%23Caesium-137">Cs</a>. Cs is produced in nuclear power plants following the <a href="chain%20reaction">chain</a> decay of <a href="Uranium-235">U</a> to <a href="Isotopes%20of%20tellurium%23Tellurium-137">Te</a>, and has a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of thirty years. A German study showed that mushrooms collected from 1986 to 1988 had radiocaesium contents that were 8.3 to 13.6 times greater than mushrooms collected before the accident in 1985. This caesium-sequestering effect is caused by a brown <a href="biological%20pigment">pigment</a>, the <a href="polyphenol">polyphenol</a> compound <a href="norbadione%20A">norbadione A</a>, which is related to a family of mushroom pigments known as <a href="pulvinic%20acid">pulvinic acid</a>s. Norbadione A has been investigated for its ability to provide a protective effect against the damaging effects of <a href="ionizing%20radiation">ionizing radiation</a>. Tests with cell cultures and mice show that although it has some protective effect, it is <a href="cytotoxicity">toxic</a> to cells in higher doses. A new series of alkali <a href="chelation">chelators</a> based on the structure of norbadione A has been reported. The mushroom may have potential as a <a href="bioremediation">bioremediation</a> agent to clean up <a href="radioactive%20contamination">contaminated</a> sites.

St Botolph's Church, Quarrington

St Botolph's Church is an <a href="Church%20of%20England">Anglican</a> place of worship in the village of <a href="Quarrington%2C%20Lincolnshire">Quarrington</a>, part of the <a href="civil%20parish">civil parish</a> of <a href="Sleaford">Sleaford</a> in <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>, England. The area has been settled since at least the <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20England">Anglo-Saxon period</a>, and a church existed at Quarrington by the time "<a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday</a>" was compiled in 1086, when it formed part of <a href="Ramsey%20Abbey">Ramsey Abbey</a>'s <a href="Fief">fee</a>. It was granted to <a href="Haverholme%20Priory">Haverholme Priory</a> about 1165, and the Abbey claimed the <a href="Advowson">right to present the rector</a> in the 13th century. This right was claimed by the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Lincoln</a> during the <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a> in the early 16th century, and then passed to <a href="Robert%20Carre">Robert Carre</a> and his descendants after Carre acquired a manor at Quarrington. With capacity for 124 people, the church serves the <a href="ecclesiastic%20parish">ecclesiastic parish</a> of Quarrington with Old Sleaford and, as of 2009, had an average congregation of 50.

Recognised for its age and <a href="tracery">tracery</a>, the church has been designated a grade II* <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>. It has a <a href="bell%20tower">tower</a> and <a href="spire">spire</a> with a <a href="nave">nave</a> and north aisle ending at a <a href="chancel">chancel</a> at the east end. The oldest parts of the building date to the 13th century, although substantial rebuilding took place over the following century. Renovations followed, and the local architect Charles Kirk the Younger carried out <a href="Victorian%20restoration">restoration</a> work in 1862–63, when he added the chancel in his parents' memory. The high interior's three bays of <a href="Arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcading</a> correspond to the three windows in the nave's south wall and the north aisle wall; those on the south wall are unusual for the hexagons and <a href="trefoil">trefoil</a>s in the designs.

St Botolph's Church is the <a href="parish%20church">parish church</a> of the <a href="benefice">benefice</a> of <a href="Quarrington%2C%20Lincolnshire">Quarrington</a> with Old Sleaford, which encompasses most of the village of Quarrington in the English <a href="non-metropolitan%20county">non-metropolitan county</a> of <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>. The benefice is a <a href="rectory">rectory</a> and falls within the <a href="deanery%20of%20Lafford">deanery of Lafford</a> and the archdeaconry and <a href="diocese%20of%20Lincoln">diocese of Lincoln</a>; the priest-in-charge is the Reverend Mark Stephen Thomson, who took over from the Reverend Sandra Rhys Benham in 2016. Dedicated to <a href="Botwulf%20of%20Thorney">St Botolph</a>, the church is on Town Road. The rectory was constructed in about 2000 and has a study area used as the parish office.

In addition to 20 spaces in the choir stalls, the <a href="nave">nave</a> and aisle pews can comfortably seat 124 adults and "149 at a pinch"; as of 2009, the average congregation size for the main Sunday service was 50, about half of whom were retired and 1 to 3 were under 16. In 2004, a <a href="log%20cabin">log cabin</a>-style building was constructed by Pinelog Ltd using funds from the Parochial Church Council. It serves as a robing space for choristers and can be used as a meeting room for up to 30 people. Equipped with <a href="Accessibility">accessible</a> toilet facilities, the building also serves as a <a href="Sunday%20school">Sunday school</a>.

St Botolph's Church has a west tower adjoining a nave with a north aisle; at the end of the nave is a chancel with a chapel on the north side. Owing to its age, the "excellent" tracery and a "very good" 14th-century door, the church has been listed at grade II* on the <a href="Listed%20building">Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest</a> in the United Kingdom since 1949, recognising it as "particularly important ... of more than special interest".

Incorporating a window and two light openings for the bell, the tower and its spire have been dated to the mid-14th century, although its pinnacles were replaced in 1887. The antiquarian <a href="Edward%20Trollope">Edward Trollope</a> did not like the spire's design, saying that it "looks as if it had slipped down". Built in a <a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture%23Decorated%20Gothic">Decorated Gothic</a> style, the tower joins to the nave with a triple-<a href="chamfer">chamfer</a>red arch. The nave has been heavily restored and contains elements from a range of periods. The architectural historian Sir <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> refers to the south wall as "puzzling" because of the tracery—it is unclear what is "Victorian fancy" and what is "correct restoration". The wall itself is 14th-century (Pevsner suggests about 1300) and incorporates a priest's doorway with mouldings, <a href="Capital%20%28architecture%29">capitals</a> and a bust of a man; the windows to its east have been restored, but follow a 14th-century reticulated style, although unusually they feature hexagons with pointed trefoils: "the oddest patterns", as Pevsner puts it. The north aisle is from the 13th century, although a 12th-century doorway sits between its late-14th-century windows. At the eastern end of the nave is the chancel, which has a polygonal (quinquangular) <a href="apse">apse</a> and was constructed between 1862 and 1863 by Charles Kirk the Younger in memory of his parents, the elder <a href="Charles%20Kirk%20%28senior%29">Charles Kirk</a> and his wife Elizabeth. Its windows were made by <a href="Ward%20and%20Hughes">Ward and Hughes</a>.

Both Pevsner and <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> regard the interior as high, relative to the Church's small size. The nave has arcading across three bays with chamfered arches and capitals; the arcades on the north side are <a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture%23Early%20English">Early English</a> and, dating to the 13th century, are the earliest visible parts of the church. Historic England suggest that this nave was likely added to an earlier, now-lost nave. The westernmost arch is wider and shorter than the rest, giving what Trollope called "a very awkward appearance". The chancel arch follows a 13th-century style, although it was built with the 1862–63 work. Inside the chancel, shafts with floral capitals adorn the walls, while the tiled flooring and painted roof give it a "rich" appearance. The nave includes 19th- and 20th-century windows by H. Hughes (1877) and <a href="Burlison%20and%20Grylls">Burlison and Grylls</a>, while another (dated 1917) commemorates the Barrett family. <a href="Morris%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Morris and Co.</a> worked on a window in the north aisle in 1935.

The church's fixtures include a 19th-century <a href="pulpit">pulpit</a> and choir stalls, and a <a href="Rood%20screen">chancel screen</a> in a Decorated style; a <a href="Baptismal%20font">font</a> from the 14th century has foliage designs on the bowl, but lacks a base. The earliest record of an <a href="Pipe%20organ">organ</a> at St Botolph's is from 1867, when one was opened for the chancel by Bevington; it has since been moved to <a href="Pointon">Pointon</a>. In 1915, the church paid for an organ bought from N. E. Snow to be fixed by Cousans at the cost of £130. The present organ, however, was built in 1929 by J. J. Binns and has two manuals and a pedalboard. 

Some of the memorials in St Botolph's date to the 18th and 19th centuries, although a plaque commemorating one Thomas Appleby dates to 1683, and several other 17th-century tablets were noted by <a href="Gervase%20Holles">Gervase Holles</a>. A tablet to Romaine Hervey (d. 1837) by J. J. Saunders is inside the church; elsewhere in the grounds are tombstones belonging to the Sharpe and Kirk families and markers to the Shannons, including the artist <a href="Charles%20Haslewood%20Shannon">Charles Haslewood Shannon</a> (d. 1937), whose father, Rev. Frederick William Shannon, was rector of Quarrington and Old Sleaford from 1861 to 1910. The <a href="churchyard">churchyard</a> contains the <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Commonwealth war graves</a> of four British Army soldiers of the <a href="World%20War%20I%20casualties">First World War</a> and four <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> airmen of the <a href="World%20War%20II%20casualties">Second World War</a>.

<a href="Ramsey%20Abbey">Ramsey Abbey</a> possessed a manor at Quarrington from about 1051 which, by the time "Domesday" was compiled, included two churches. The antiquarian James Creasey suggested that the missing church was <a href="All%20Saints%27%20Church%2C%20Old%20Sleaford">All Saints' in Old Sleaford</a>, where the Abbey held a manor as <a href="Soke%20%28legal%29">sokeland</a> of Quarrington, while Trollope thought it had been lost, buried "probably in a farm yard now occupied by Mrs. Cubley". In 1909, two amateur local historians, H. Greenval and F. Cenlices, reckoned that both churches were lost and had stood on land marked by stone crosses near Tellgate on the Sleaford–<a href="Folkingham">Folkingham</a> road and on Stump Cross Hill. But in 1979, the local historians Christine Mahany and David Roffe reassessed the "Domesday" evidence and, after analysing the manorial structure, documentary evidence and the history of the <a href="advowson">advowson</a> of All Saints', concluded that it was the second church in the Abbey's manor of Quarrington, and that the other church was St Botolph's or a predecessor.

Henry Selvein, a knight, held Quarrington of the Abbey and in about 1165 granted it to <a href="Haverholme%20Priory">Haverholme Priory</a>, who presented Alexander de Brauncewell as rector in 1218. The priory are known to have presented rectors in 1248 and 1269 as well. The Bishop of Lincoln, who had held a manor at Quarrington since "Domesday", claimed the right to present its rector in the early 16th century. Bishop <a href="Henry%20Holbeach">Holbeach</a> <a href="Alienation%20%28property%20law%29">alienated</a> the manor to the Crown in 1547, and it was eventually purchased by the Sleaford merchant <a href="Robert%20Carre">Robert Carre</a>, but the Bishop still tried to present the rector; Carre protested, and the dispute was settled when Lord Chief Justice <a href="Edward%20Coke">Coke</a> ruled that Carre would present in future.

A slender chancel arch existed until the mid-19th century and might have been pre-<a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Conquest</a>, but the earliest visible extant part of the church is the 13th-century north <a href="Arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcade</a>, which may have been added to an earlier, now-lost, nave. The spire and tower date to the middle of the next century, roughly when the nave was rebuilt. Many of the windows are reticulated in a fashion popular during the early 14th century. Several medieval bequests are known: Olivia, wife of John Rossen of Quarrington, left 12 <a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">pence</a> to the rector and church each in 1412; a donation of wool was made by another parishioner, Joan, wife of William Ward, around the same time. Later, 8 pence was left to the churchwardens by an unknown resident.

In the latter half of the 16th century, the living of Old Sleaford became "extremely poor" and its church probably fell out of use. Some time afterwards, the rector of Quarrington obtained a presentation to Old Sleaford, but, discovering the lack of <a href="tithe">tithe</a>s, he left. Robert Carre convinced him to take in the parishioners of Old Sleaford at Quarrington in return for a yearly payment; as of 2015, the parishes are still combined. Amendments to the fabric of the church were made in the early modern period, beginning when the chancel was rebuilt on a smaller scale some time after the <a href="English%20Reformation">Reformation</a> and inset with 12th- and 13th-century stonework, the whole thing described as "very miserable" by Edward Trollope. This was replaced in 1812 by a <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a>-style chancel, constructed under the guidance of the rector, <a href="Charles%20James%20Blomfield">Charles James Blomfield</a>. The North Aisle was rebuilt in 1848 and a new pulpit, screen and pews were added the following year.

The Victorian period witnessed extensive restoration work at Quarrington. Most of the nave's windows were altered, and the <a href="chancel">chancel</a> and part of the vestry were rebuilt by Charles Kirk in 1862–63, who also widened the chancel arch. Parts of the tower and spire were remodelled 24 years later. The Census of Religious Worship (1851) reveals that the Church had room for 120 people, attendances of 20 and 40 in the morning and afternoon respectively and 20 Sunday scholars. As Sleaford expanded, houses were built along London and Station Roads, pushing the town inside the Quarrington parish boundaries in what became New Quarrington. To deal with the growing population, a second church was designed in the early 1900s on donated land in the parish, to be built closer to Sleaford. Disruption during the <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20during%20World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, parish boundary changes in 1928, and rising costs delayed the plans. Instead a church hall was built in 1932 on Grantham Road and as of 2009 was being used as a community centre. An extension to the Church was added in 2001, providing a kitchen, accessible toilet and other facilities; built in matching stone, it incorporated a stained glass window from the north aisle.

Hurricane Fred (2015)

Hurricane Fred was the easternmost <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane">Atlantic hurricane</a> to form in the <a href="tropical%20Atlantic">tropics</a>, and the first to move through <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a> since <a href="1892%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season%23Hurricane%20Five">1892</a>. The second hurricane and sixth <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20naming%23North%20Atlantic">named storm</a> of the <a href="2015%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">2015 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, Fred originated from a well-defined <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> over <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a> in late August 2015. Once offshore, the wave moved northwestward within a favorable <a href="Troposphere">tropospheric</a> environment and strengthened into a <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%23tropical%20storm">tropical storm</a> on August 30. The following day, Fred grew to a <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20hurricane%20wind%20scale%23Category%201">Category 1 hurricane</a> with peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) as it approached Cape Verde. After passing <a href="Boa%20Vista%2C%20Cape%20Verde">Boa Vista</a> and moving away from <a href="Santo%20Ant%C3%A3o%2C%20Cape%20Verde">Santo Antão</a>, it entered a phase of steady weakening, dropping below hurricane status by September 1. Fred then turned to the west-northwest, enduring increasingly hostile <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>, but maintained its status as a tropical cyclone despite repeated forecasts of imminent dissipation. It fluctuated between minimal tropical storm and tropical depression strength through September 4–5. Curving sharply to the north, Fred's circulation pattern had diminished considerably by September 6, and the storm dissipated later that day.

Under threat from the hurricane, all of Cape Verde was placed under a <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches%23Hurricane%20warning">hurricane warning</a> for the first time in the nation's history. <a href="Gale">Gale</a>-force winds battered much of the <a href="Barlavento%20Islands">Barlavento region</a> throughout August 31, downing trees and utility poles. On the easternmost islands of Boa Vista and <a href="Sal%2C%20Cape%20Verde">Sal</a>, Fred leveled roofs and left several villages without power or phone services for a few days. About 70 percent of the houses in <a href="Povoa%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Velha">Povoação Velha</a> suffered light to moderate damage. Across the northernmost islands, rainstorms flooded homes, washed out roads, and ruined farmland; <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Nicolau%2C%20Cape%20Verde">São Nicolau</a> endured great losses of crops and livestock. Material damage across Cape Verde totaled <a href="US%24">US$</a>2.5 million, though the rain's overall impact on agriculture was positive and replenishing. <a href="Swell%20%28ocean%29">Swells</a> from the hurricane produced violent seas along the West African shoreline, destroying fishing villages and submerging swaths of residential areas in <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>. Between the coasts of West Africa and Cape Verde, maritime incidents related to Fred resulted in nine deaths.

Early on August 28, the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> (NHC) began monitoring an unusually vigorous <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a>—an elongated <a href="Low-pressure%20area">area of low air pressure</a>—inland over <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>. Trailed by widespread cloudiness, the wave tracked toward the open Atlantic as it developed a broad cyclonic rotation within the lower atmosphere near <a href="Guinea%20region">Guinea</a>'s coastline. The disturbance veered toward the northwest and entered the ocean off <a href="Conakry">Conakry</a> around 18:00 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a>, August 29. By that time, the NHC was predicting a favorable environment for <a href="Tropical%20cyclogenesis">tropical cyclone development</a> within the next 48 hours; heavy thunderstorms thrived overnight and consolidated near a well-defined low-pressure center. Around midnight August 30, <a href="Weather%20satellite">satellite images</a> and <a href="scatterometer">scatterometer</a> data confirmed that a <a href="tropical%20depression">tropical depression</a> had formed about 300 miles (480 km) west-northwest of Conakry, with <a href="Maximum%20sustained%20wind">wind speeds</a> of 35 mph (55 km/h).

Although tropical cyclones in the extreme eastern Atlantic are typically propelled westward by <a href="High-pressure%20area">high pressures</a> from a <a href="subtropical%20ridge">subtropical ridge</a>, this depression took an atypical northwestward path along a breach in the ridge from a previous disturbance. Its cyclonic structure steadily improved as a sharply curved <a href="rainband">rainband</a>, resembling the precursor to an <a href="Eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a>, tightened around the center. At 06:00 UTC on August 30, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fred 390 mi (625 km) east-southeast of <a href="Praia">Praia</a>, <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a>—among the four easternmost locations for a tropical storm to form since modern record-keeping began in 1851. A steady trend of intensification ensued while Fred moved through a region with ample tropical moisture, light upper winds, and above-average <a href="sea%20surface%20temperature">sea surface temperature</a>s. The storm developed a thick, circular <a href="central%20dense%20overcast">central dense overcast</a> with good <a href="Outflow%20%28meteorology%29">outflow</a>, and the eye feature became well established at all levels of the circulation. Based on these characteristics, as well as satellite intensity estimates of 75 mph (120 km/h) winds, Fred was upgraded to a <a href="Saffir-Simpson%20hurricane%20wind%20scale%23Category%201">Category 1 hurricane</a> at 00:00 UTC, August 31. Then centered 165 mi (270 km) east-southeast of <a href="Sal%2C%20Cape%20Verde">Sal, Cape Verde</a>, it became the easternmost tropical cyclone ever to attain hurricane status in the <a href="tropical%20Atlantic">tropical Atlantic</a>.
A compact cyclone, Fred quickly reached its peak strength as a hurricane, with a minimum central pressure of 986 <a href="Bar%20%28unit%29">mbar</a> (<a href="Pascal%20%28unit%29">hPa</a>; 29.12 <a href="Inch%20of%20mercury">inHg</a>) and 85 mph (140 km/h) winds. Through the rest of August 31, the hurricane traversed the <a href="Barlavento%20Islands">Barlavento Islands</a> of Cape Verde, barely skirting the southern coast of <a href="Boa%20Vista%2C%20Cape%20Verde">Boa Vista</a> around 12:00 UC. Gradually decreasing in definition, the eye passed north of <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Nicolau%2C%20Cape%20Verde">São Nicolau</a> and then north-northeast of <a href="Santo%20Ant%C3%A3o%2C%20Cape%20Verde">Santo Antão</a> over the next 12 hours. On September 1, drier air and stronger <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> aloft dispersed the <a href="Atmospheric%20convection">convection</a> around the cyclone's core, causing Fred to diminish to a tropical storm. The weakened storm turned slightly toward the west-northwest, over considerably cooler waters, in response to high pressure rebuilding to its north. Through much of September 1–4, Fred produced limited convective activity, with intermittent flares of thunderstorms that were continuously blown away from the center by the strong upper winds. Despite the adverse environment and the storm's lack of stable convection, Fred maintained a robust spiral of low-level clouds and <a href="gale">gale</a>s during this period, defying the NHC's repeated forecasts of its dissipation.

At 12:00 UTC on September 4, the NHC downgraded Fred to a tropical depression as its wind circulation waned; though its winds briefly picked back up to tropical storm force the next day, Fred continued as a depression with minimal convection throughout the remainder of its existence. Concurrently, a deep-altitude disturbance a few hundred miles east of <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> began to erode the southern edge of the high-pressure ridge that Fred had circumnavigated for most of its journey. This changed the <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%23Environmental%20steering">steering pattern</a> in the region, turning the depression abruptly to the north on September 6. Over the next hours, Fred became increasingly diffuse because of its progressively worsening surroundings. It officially lost its status as a tropical cyclone at 18:00 UTC, degenerating into a <a href="Trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> 1,210 mi (1,945 km) southwest of the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> and later merging with a <a href="weather%20front">frontal boundary</a> nearby.

<a href="Swell%20%28ocean%29">Swells</a> from Fred reached wide stretches of the West African coastline, stirring up high seas as far north as <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>. Along the shorelines between <a href="Dakar">Dakar</a> and <a href="M%27Bour">M'Bour</a>, rough surf devastated entire fishing districts and harbor towns, stranding boats and damaging roads and bridges. About 200 houses were demolished in the district of <a href="Hann%2C%20Senegal">Hann</a>, many of which experienced total wall collapse; dwellings in the town of <a href="Bargny%2C%20Senegal">Bargny</a> endured similar destruction. In the suburb of <a href="Rufisque">Rufisque</a>, the waves overtopped dams, entered homes and cemeteries, and destroyed a mosque. Outside the capital area, several villages were completely cut off from their surroundings. Victims across the affected region received more than 100 tons (220,000 lbs) of rice and 12 million <a href="West%20African%20CFA%20franc">CFA francs</a> (US$20,000) in government relief funds.

Farther south, in <a href="Guinea-Bissau">Guinea-Bissau</a>, a <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> flooded roads and low-lying establishments, such as offices and military barracks. The sea water submerged vast amounts of cropland in the <a href="Tombali%20Region">Tombali Region</a>, resulting in great losses of rice. Offshore, waves as high as 23 feet (7 m) capsized a fishing boat with a crew of 19; twelve members were rescued, but the remaining seven disappeared at sea and were presumed dead.

A <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches%23Tropical%20Storm%20Warning">tropical storm warning</a> was issued for Cape Verde upon the storm's formation, as well as a <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches%23Hurricane%20watch">hurricane watch</a> in light of forecasts of additional intensification. When Fred showed definitive signs of strengthening, the alerts were replaced by a <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches%23Hurricane%20warning">hurricane warning</a>, marking the first occasion of a hurricane-level notice in the nation's history. On the morning of August 31, <a href="TACV">TACV Cabo Verde Airlines</a> suspended its flights from the capital of Praia to Dakar; all operations at the airports of Boa Vista, Sal, and <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Vicente%2C%20Cape%20Verde">São Vicente</a> were halted soon after squalls began to spread across the islands. Officials urged shipping interests on all islands to secure their vessels and remain in port. A national music festival was canceled in <a href="Porto%20Novo%2C%20Cape%20Verde">Porto Novo</a>, on the northernmost island of Santo Antão.

Traversing the easternmost Cape Verde Islands on the afternoon of August 31, Fred brought strong thunderstorms with 60 mph (100 km/h) winds and 3.8 inches (96 mm) of rain to Boa Vista, uprooting trees, damaging roofs and plaster, and knocking out power to most of the population. Cellphone service from a local carrier went down after the winds toppled a transmission tower in <a href="Sal%20Rei%2C%20Cape%20Verde">Sal Rei</a>. Two inhabitants were taken to hospital for non-critical injuries when their home partially collapsed. Floods swept through low-lying areas of <a href="Rabil%2C%20Cape%20Verde">Rabil</a> and cut off the main road to surrounding towns, hampering the mobilization of emergency workers. The southern village of <a href="Povoa%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Velha">Povoação Velha</a> bore the brunt of the storm; about 70 percent of the houses there experienced some degree of damage, from broken tiles and windows to crumbled walls, with repair costs of 3 million <a href="Cape%20Verdean%20escudo">Cape Verdean escudo</a>s (CVE$; US$30,000). A compromised infrastructure left the village without power and telephone services for at least five days. Throughout Boa Vista, losses from Fred were estimated at CVE$76 million ($760,000), including CVE$26 million ($260,000) in restoration costs.

Similar conditions occurred in parts of the other eastern islands. Along the southern shore of Sal, Fred's storm surge sunk or stranded dozens of vessels and destroyed the island's main tourist pier in <a href="Santa%20Maria%2C%20Cape%20Verde">Santa Maria</a>. Pier restoration was incomplete as of May 2017, about 1.5 years after the hurricane; the delay led to concerns over the island's precarious, tourism-reliant economy. Hotels, restaurants, and beach facilities were flooded, and roads in the town became impassable. Gusts leveled the roof of a high school gym, which had initially been set up as a storm shelter to 100 citizens. Elsewhere on the island, the winds knocked out power to homes in <a href="Palmeira%2C%20Cape%20Verde">Palmeira</a>, and caused minor structural damage to <a href="Am%C3%ADlcar%20Cabral%20International%20Airport">Sal International Airport</a>. At the height of the hurricane, flooding forced nearly 130 people living in the impoverished outskirts of <a href="Terra%20Boa%2C%20Cape%20Verde">Terra Boa</a> and <a href="Espargos">Espargos</a> to relocate to shelters. Fred destroyed 80 percent of the <a href="Loggerhead%20sea%20turtle">Loggerhead sea turtle</a> nests on the beaches of Sal, a crucial nesting site for this species. Overall, Sal suffered CVE$30 million ($300,000) in damage from the hurricane. The storm's outer bands dropped heavy rain on the islands of <a href="Santiago%2C%20Cape%20Verde">Santiago</a> and <a href="Fogo%2C%20Cape%20Verde">Fogo</a>, peaking at 13 in (330 mm) over the mountains of Santiago and causing widespread damage to roads, sidewalks, and walls. In <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Miguel%2C%20Cape%20Verde">São Miguel</a>, flood waters and fallen trees led to major traffic obstructions. Conversely, the rains replenished water reserves and filled a large dam in <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Salvador%20do%20Mundo%2C%20Cape%20Verde">São Salvador do Mundo</a> to maximum capacity, irrigating adjacent arable lands. Structural damage across Santiago, largely in flooded urban areas, reached CVE$87 million ($860,000).
Across the mountainous northern Barlavento Islands, Fred produced gusty winds and downpours; São Nicolau experienced sustained hurricane-force winds of 80 mph (130 km/h)—the highest recorded wind speed from the hurricane. Rainfall on that island was moderate, peaking at 3.5 in (90 mm) at <a href="Juncalinho">Juncalinho</a>. Many old trees were uprooted, a few landslides took place, and several villages lost power on that island. The strong winds downed power poles and wrecked the roof of a church in the village of <a href="Cabe%C3%A7alinho">Cabeçalinho</a>. In <a href="Ribeira%20Brava%2C%20Cape%20Verde">Ribeira Brava</a>, São Nicolau's most populous town, the storm damaged 70 homes, destroyed greenhouses, and leveled a farm, leaving several families homeless and others without a source of income. In <a href="Carri%C3%A7al">Carriçal</a>, similar effects were felt as torrential rainfall flooded homes, washed out roads, and ruined fruit and <a href="Hydroponics">hydroponic</a> crops. Much of São Nicolau's livestock, including cattle from <a href="Hortel%C3%A3">Hortelã</a>, was lost in the storm. Damage to property and agriculture—in particular banana and sugarcane—on the island reached CVE$50 million ($500,000).

On the neighboring islands of São Vicente and Santo Antão, the storm's impact was mostly limited to power outages, floods, and damaged crops. Santo Antão recorded light winds and 8 in (200 mm) of rain, although higher elevations received even greater quantities. In Porto Novo, 35 people had to be relocated as floods swept through neighborhoods. The rainfall washed out the island's carrot, cabbage, and tomato plantations, especially in the vicinity of <a href="Alto%20Mira">Alto Mira</a>. On São Vicente, roads were closed in and around <a href="Laginha">Laginha</a>, and one person suffered minor injuries when a tree fell on their car. The combined cost for the two islands, mainly from infrastructural damage, totaled CVE$16 million ($160,000).

Throughout Cape Verde, Hurricane Fred displaced more than 50 families and caused CVE$250 million ($2.5 million) in damage, mostly to the agricultural and private sectors of the Barlavento region. It was the first hurricane to move through the islands with documented impacts, as well as the nation's only record of onshore hurricane-force winds. Although there were no casualties on land, two fishermen navigating through the storm never returned to port in Boa Vista and were presumed dead. Despite the losses in crops and livestock, rainfall from Fred had a generally positive effect on the larger-scale agriculture of the islands, refilling many rivers and dams and irrigating drought-stricken farmland across the <a href="Sotavento%20Islands">Sotavento region</a>.

Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollar

The Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollar, sometimes the Lexington-Concord half dollar or Patriot half dollar, is <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">a commemorative</a> <a href="Half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">fifty-cent piece</a> struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> in 1925 in honor of the 150th anniversary of the <a href="Battles%20of%20Lexington%20and%20Concord">Battles of Lexington and Concord</a>. It was designed by <a href="Chester%20Beach">Chester Beach</a>.

Members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation introduced legislation in 1924 which would provide for a commemorative half dollar for the anniversary. The bill passed both houses of Congress and was signed by President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>. Beach had to satisfy committees from both <a href="Lexington%2C%20Massachusetts">Lexington</a> and <a href="Concord%2C%20Massachusetts">Concord</a>, and the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a> passed the design only reluctantly, feeling Beach had been given poor materials to work with.

The coins were sold for $1, and were vended at the anniversary celebrations in Lexington and in Concord; they were sold at banks across New England. Although just over half of the authorized mintage of 300,000 was struck, almost all of the coins that were minted were sold. Depending on condition, they are catalogued in the hundreds of dollars.

The <a href="Battles%20of%20Lexington%20and%20Concord">Battles of Lexington and Concord</a> took place in those neighboring Massachusetts towns on April 19, 1775. The enmity between the British government and the American colonials that preceded the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">Revolutionary War</a> had led, by early 1775, to militia groups, hostile to the British, being formed in the Boston area. These groups, under the control of Massachusetts leader <a href="John%20Hancock">John Hancock</a>'s <a href="Committees%20of%20safety%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Committee of Safety</a>, were often dubbed <a href="minutemen">minutemen</a> for their readiness to assemble to fight at a moment's notice. Caches of munitions were stored at various towns for their use, including at <a href="Concord%2C%20Massachusetts">Concord</a>.
The <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Colonies">Secretary of State for the Colonies</a>, <a href="William%20Legge%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Dartmouth">Lord Dartmouth</a>, instructed the British commander in Boston, General <a href="Thomas%20Gage">Thomas Gage</a>, to stamp out this resistance. On April 18, 1775, Gage secretly ordered Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Francis%20Smith%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Francis Smith</a> to go with 700 men to Concord and destroy the munitions there. It is uncertain how the Americans came to hear of the plan: Gage's wife <a href="Margaret%20Kemble%20Gage">Margaret</a> was born in New Jersey and may have been a spy. Another local leader, <a href="Joseph%20Warren">Joseph Warren</a>, informed <a href="Paul%20Revere">Paul Revere</a> and <a href="William%20Dawes">William Dawes</a>, and the two men went by separate roads to <a href="Lexington%2C%20Massachusetts">Lexington</a> to alert leaders there and to assemble the militia. Both got to Lexington, where they met with Hancock and <a href="Samuel%20Adams">Samuel Adams</a>. The supplies in Concord were moved.

British troops began their march at 2 am on April 19, and Smith sent troops ahead under Major <a href="John%20Pitcairn">John Pitcairn</a>. When Pitcairn and his men found a company of armed colonials at Lexington, he ordered them to disperse. In the confusion, a shot was fired from an unknown source, which brought several volleys from the British troops. Eight of the local men were killed and one British soldier was wounded. The British burned or otherwise destroyed what supplies they could find in Concord, and a second confrontation took place at the <a href="Old%20North%20Bridge">North Bridge</a>. The bridge was held by the British, and by then about 400 minutemen had assembled. Seeing the smoke from Concord, the colonials believed the town was being burned, and attempted to cross the bridge to succor it. The British fired on them but the colonials returned fire and defeated them. The British, who had gotten reinforcements once they realized the countryside was roused against them, began their march to Boston harassed by at least 2,000 militiamen who inflicted a steady toll by gunfire until the British gained the protection of the cannon near Boston. The encounters at Lexington and Concord were the first battles of what became the Revolutionary War.

Identical <a href="joint%20resolution">joint resolution</a>s to establish a United States Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial Commission and to authorize federal participation in the celebrations surrounding the 150th anniversary of the battles were introduced into the House of Representatives by Massachusetts congressmen <a href="John%20Jacob%20Rogers">John Jacob Rogers</a> and <a href="Frederick%20Dallinger">Frederick Dallinger</a> on May 5, 1924. <a href="Robert%20Luce">Robert Luce</a>, also of that state, introduced an identical copy. Rogers represented Concord's district in Congress, while the townsfolk of Lexington were among Dallinger's constituents. All three bills were referred to the Committee on the Library, presided over by Luce. Hearings were held on May 8, 1924, with both Rogers and Dallinger present. Rogers spoke of the 1875 celebrations of the Lexington and Concord centennials, which President <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>, Vice President <a href="Henry%20Wilson">Henry Wilson</a>, Speaker of the House <a href="James%20G.%20Blaine">James G. Blaine</a> and other notables had attended. These celebrations were not jointly held by Lexington and Concord; instead, there were two separate programs, though there was full cooperation between the two towns. They intended to follow this pattern for the 150th anniversary in 1925: although there would be considerable coordination, each town would have its own committee and its own events.

Rogers outlined the request for the establishment of the commission, with four members to be appointed by each house of Congress and three by President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>. Rodgers and Dallinger wanted $10,000 for the commission, and for Congress to authorize the issuance of commemorative coins and <a href="postage%20stamp">stamps</a>. Rogers told the committee that the language for the legislative provisions for the coin had been borrowed from the bill for the <a href="Pilgrim%20Tercentenary%20half%20dollar">Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar</a> (1920–1921), and reminded them of other commemorative coins that had been issued. At the time, commemorative coins were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. A maximum of 300,000 coins was requested. Dallinger noted that the government would incur no cost from the commemorative half dollars: it would profit from the <a href="seignorage">seignorage</a> and would never be called upon to redeem them, as they would be retained by collectors. After the two congressmen appeared, Chairman Luce introduced a letter from the <a href="Senate%20Majority%20Leader">Senate Majority Leader</a>, <a href="Henry%20Cabot%20Lodge%2C%20Sr.">Henry Cabot Lodge</a> of Massachusetts, indicating his support for the bill. Luce reported his own version of the resolution the following day, with his committee's recommendation that it pass.

The resolution was brought to the House floor on June 7, 1924, when Luce asked that the House pass the legislation. He had alluded in his report to the well-known <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a> poem "<a href="Concord%20Hymn">Concord Hymn</a>" by including the phrase "embattled farmers", a reference which Arkansas's <a href="Otis%20Wingo">Otis Wingo</a> used as an excuse to deliver a lengthy speech on tariffs, accusing the Republican majority of harming the farmer. Once Wingo had finished to applause from the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> side, the House passed the bill without a recorded vote, with Rogers presiding over the House in the absence of <a href="Frederick%20H.%20Gillett">the Speaker</a>. The resolution was transmitted to the Senate the same day and was referred to the <a href="Senate%20Appropriations%20Committee">Senate Appropriations Committee</a>. On January 5, 1925, the resolution was reported back to the Senate by Wyoming's <a href="Francis%20Warren">Francis Warren</a>, unamended, with the recommendation that it pass. Senator <a href="Joseph%20Taylor%20Robinson">Joseph T. Robinson</a> of Arkansas asked for the amount of the appropriation being made in the bill, and when told it was $15,000, had no additional questions. The bill passed without opposition, and was enacted with the signature of President Coolidge on January 14, 1925.

In 1923, the committee from Lexington and the one from Concord each had considered pressing for a commemorative coin, and each, unbeknownst to the other, had contacted <a href="Chester%20Beach">Chester Beach</a>, credited with the design for the <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine%20Centennial%20half%20dollar">Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar</a>. Beach got them to combine their efforts and each agreed to pay half of his fee of $1,250. Each town would decide the design for one side of the half dollar.

Judge Prescott Keyes, who led the Concord committee, sent Beach the proposed design for the obverse (the Concord side) on February 2, 1925, letting him know the Lexington design for the reverse, or Lexington side, would soon follow. The following day, Edward Stone, attorney for the Lexington committee, sent Beach a letter formalizing the contract. Beach would not be paid unless the Commission of Fine Arts approved the plaster models. Beach replied to Stone on the 4th, relating that he had spoken to <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a>, designer of the <a href="Buffalo%20nickel">Buffalo nickel</a> and sculptor member of the commission, and had been informed that the commission had just had its monthly meeting, but that a quorum could be assembled to approve the coin. Beach noted that the Mint would take three or four weeks to begin striking coins once final approval was given; he had discussed this with Chief Engraver <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">George T. Morgan</a> in 1924. Morgan had recently died, but Beach did not expect the new chief engraver, <a href="John%20R.%20Sinnock">John R. Sinnock</a>, to cause any additional delays.
On February 4, Concord artist Philip Holden sent Beach improved sketches for both sides. Beach had been under the impression that the year must appear on the coin by itself, in addition to the anniversary dates ; on February 5 Keyes wrote to Beach that he had viewed the Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar and the <a href="Huguenot-Walloon%20half%20dollar">Huguenot-Walloon half dollar</a>. Both bore their dates only as part of anniversaries. Keyes noted that the two coins had the words "" and "" respectively before "", and proposed that the word "" appear in the same place on the new coin. Keyes noted that April 19, the anniversary of both battles, is <a href="Patriot%20Day">Patriot Day</a> in Massachusetts. He insisted that the words "" appear even if it was illegible, "the public in these two towns are sometimes pretty sensitive about petty matters and so Mr. Stone and I have been very particular to come to an agreement as to all details."

Beach agreed to the wording changes, subject to approval by the authorities in Washington. On February 12, 1925, Keyes wrote again to tell him that <a href="Harry%20B.%20Little">Harry B. Little</a>, architect of the <a href="National%20Cathedral">National Cathedral</a>, had looked at the designs and had suggestions, including moving the words "" from the lower part of the Concord side to the left of the minuteman. He also proposed putting "April 19" on the coin; Beach did not do so, though he adopted other suggestions from Keyes. The Commission of Fine Arts felt that French's statue, due to its narrowness, was not suitable for a coin. Nevertheless, it approved the design, with Moore writing to Mint Director <a href="Robert%20J.%20Grant">Robert J. Grant</a> on March 5 that "a designer should be permitted to use symbols as he best knows how to use them in filling the spaces of a coin or medal."

By March 27, trial strikes had been made of the new coin at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>. Stone ordered an initial quantity of 100,000 half dollars on March 31.

The obverse reproduces <a href="Daniel%20Chester%20French">Daniel Chester French</a>'s statue "The Minute Man" that stands in Concord. Commemorating the <a href="minutemen">minutemen</a>, volunteer militia who fought the British in 1775, it depicts a farmer, rifle in hand. His coat is draped over his plow, and he is ready to respond to the signal to assemble, presumably to be given by the bell in the Old Belfry at Lexington, the subject of the reverse of the coin. The minuteman's head obscures part of the name of the country he helped to establish, and he is flanked on the left by the words "" and on the right by "". French meant to represent militia captain <a href="Isaac%20Davis%20%28soldier%29">Isaac Davis</a>, who was killed at Concord. Not shown on the coin, but on the base of the statue in Concord, is the first stanza of Ralph Waldo Emerson's poem, "Concord Hymn", verses dutifully memorized by generations of American schoolchildren.
The reverse depicts the Old Belfry, located in Lexington, where a bell was sounded to assemble the local militia. The belfry was not then old, having been built following the donation of a bell weighing by Isaac Stone to the town of Lexington in 1761. The bell was sounded after Revere and Dawes arrived, but when no British soldiers appeared, Captain <a href="John%20Parker%20%28captain%29">John Parker</a> sent his men home, with instructions to remain ready. It was sounded again at 5:30 am, when word came the British were not far away.

Numismatist John F. Jones, in his 1937 survey of commemoratives, felt the statue and belfry highly appropriate subjects for the coin, but regretted that it lacked the clear, sharp lines of earlier special issues. Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, in his book on U.S. coins and medals, stated that the Lexington-Concord half dollar "is almost reduced to the artistic level of a photograph, for little is left that is original on the part of Beach". Vermeule deprecated the many inscriptions, though admitting they were forced on Beach, and especially disliked the placement of "In God We Trust": "nothing is more out of place than the religious motto." Vermeule opined that "although less irritating than <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine%20Centennial%20half%20dollar">his half-dollar for the Monroe Doctrine Centennial</a>, this coin does no credit to Beach's stature as a first-class artist. What the coin exudes in patriotism, it lacks in art."

A total of 162,099 Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint in April and May, 1925, with 99 pieces set aside for inspection and testing by the 1926 <a href="Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>. The coins were made from blanks, or <a href="planchet">planchet</a>s, that had been intended for mintage into 1924 <a href="Stone%20Mountain%20Memorial%20half%20dollar">Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar</a>s, but had not been used.

The first coin struck was presented to President Coolidge. The half dollars were sold at the anniversary celebrations in Lexington and at those in Concord, both held April 18–20, 1925, with 39,000 sold in Lexington and 21,000 in Concord. Distribution was handled by the Lexington Trust Company and the Concord National Bank, which sold them in wooden boxes decorated with images of the statue and belfry. They were sold by banks throughout New England, and to some extent elsewhere in the country. Only 86 coins were returned to the Mint, likely representing damaged pieces. Most were sold to the general public, not to collectors. The asking price was $1. The edition of <a href="R.S.%20Yeoman">R.S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" published in 2015 lists the half dollar at between $100 and $975 depending on condition. An exceptional specimen sold at auction in 2014 for $11,880.

Norse-American medal

The Norse-American medal was struck at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> in 1925, pursuant to an act of the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a>. It was issued for <a href="Norse-American%20Centennial">the 100th anniversary of the voyage</a> of the ship "<a href="Restauration%20%28ship%29">Restauration</a>", bringing early Norwegian immigrants to the United States.

<a href="U.S.%20Representative">U.S. Representative</a> from <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> <a href="Ole%20Juulson%20Kvale">Ole Juulson Kvale</a>, a <a href="Norwegian-American">Norse-American</a>, wanted a commemorative for the centennial celebrations of the "Restauration" journey. Rebuffed by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Department</a> when he sought the issuance of a special coin, he instead settled for a medal. Sculpted by <a href="Buffalo%20nickel">Buffalo nickel</a> designer <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a>, the medals recognize those immigrants' <a href="Vikings">Viking</a> heritage, depicting a warrior of that culture on the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> and his vessel on the reverse. The medals also recall the early Viking <a href="Norse%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">explorations of North America</a>.

Once authorized by Congress, they were produced in various metals and sizes, for the most part prior to the celebrations near <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> in June 1925. Only 53 were issued in gold, and they are rare and valuable today; those struck in silver or bronze have appreciated much less in value. They are sometimes collected as part of <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">the U.S. commemorative coin series</a>.

On July 4 or 5, 1825, the vessel "<a href="Restauration%20%28ship%29">Restauration</a>" sailed from <a href="Stavanger">Stavanger</a>, Norway, for the United States, with 45 emigrants aboard. According to what "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" deemed "<a href="bacchanalia">bacchanalia</a>n" legends of its passage, the expedition anchored off an English seacoast village and traded ashore some of its rum, only to depart in haste when local officials took an interest. Off <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a>, expedition leader Lars Larsen is said to have fished a cask from the sea, which proved to be filled with rare wine that was thoroughly enjoyed by those aboard. After they arrived in New York on October 9, the ship was seized pursuant to a court order, as the passengers exceeded the permitted number for a ship of its size by 21, counting a baby girl born to the Larsens en route. In addition, a fine was to be imposed, but because the immigrants spoke no English and had no knowledge of American laws, President <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a> issued a pardon, releasing the ship and remitting the fine. Initially settling on land they purchased near the shore of <a href="Lake%20Ontario">Lake Ontario</a>, about from <a href="Rochester%2C%20New%20York">Rochester, New York</a>, the passengers were the first of many organized groups of <a href="Norwegian-American">Norse-Americans</a> who <a href="Transatlantic%20crossing">crossed the Atlantic</a>, especially to the northern and western United States.

<a href="Ole%20Juulson%20Kvale">Ole Juulson Kvale</a> was a <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> congressman of the <a href="Farmer-Labor%20Party">Farmer-Labor Party</a>, and a proud Norse-American. Kvale was a member of the Norse-American Centennial Commission, which was to organize a 100th anniversary celebration of the "Restauration" voyage. This celebration was important to a Norse-American community that had been perceived as <a href="Opposition%20to%20World%20War%20I%23In%20the%20United%20States">antiwar</a> during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, and was attempting to display both ethnic pride and assimilation. Kvale, a <a href="The%20Norwegian%20Lutheran%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States">Lutheran</a> minister, was also a member of the <a href="House%20Committee%20on%20Coinage%2C%20Weights%2C%20and%20Measures">House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures</a>, and in January 1925 approached the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Department</a>, seeking its support for a commemorative coin in honor of the anniversary; he was told that the Treasury would oppose it. Commemorative coins for ethnic heritage groups were unlikely to pass Congress at that time due to the controversy caused by the 1924 <a href="Huguenot-Walloon%20Tercentenary%20half%20dollar">Huguenot-Walloon Tercentenary half dollar</a>, seen by some as Protestant propaganda.

On January 30, 1925, Kvale attended a meeting of the Coinage Committee, at which the proposal that would become the <a href="Vermont%20Sesquicentennial%20half%20dollar">Vermont Sesquicentennial half dollar</a> was considered. Treasury officials were present in opposition, suggesting a medal be issued instead, and Kvale asked several questions about the Mint's issuance of medals. On February 3, Kvale and <a href="Paul%20Kvale">his son Paul</a> met with Treasury officials, bringing a draft bill authorizing the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Bureau of the Mint</a> to strike commemorative medals for the "Restauration" anniversary. Acting Mint Director <a href="Mary%20M.%20O%27Reilly">Mary M. O'Reilly</a> and Treasury Undersecretary Garrard Winston were dubious about the idea of striking silver medals that would be between the <a href="Standing%20Liberty%20quarter">quarter</a> and <a href="Walking%20Liberty%20half%20dollar">half dollar</a> in size. To offset this concern, Paul Kvale suggested making the medal octagonal or hexagonal. O'Reilly and Winston favored the idea, and after Congressman Kvale met with legal counsel to the Treasury and other officials, he was assured of the department's full support. Kvale also successfully lobbied the <a href="United%20States%20Post%20Office%20Department">Post Office Department</a> for the issuance of <a href="commemorative%20stamp">commemorative stamp</a>s; he told Third Assistant <a href="United%20States%20Postmaster%20General">Postmaster General</a> Warren I. Glover that, in a broader sense, the medal recognized the North American explorations of the <a href="Vikings">Vikings</a> around the year 1000. Kvale declared that in seeking the souvenir medal and stamps, he was contributing to the "growth of the Norwegian heritage by having it 'preserved in metal' as well as 'paper <a href="time%20capsule">time capsule</a>s'."

Kvale introduced a bill for a Norse-American medal in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> on February 4, 1925. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. On behalf of that committee, Kvale reported it favorably to the full House on February 10. In the report, Kvale stated that the 40,000 medals would be struck without expense to the government, and that Treasury officials supported the bill. "In view of the importance of this celebration to the many descendants of the Norse immigrants into this country, and through these to the State of Minnesota, which is officially sponsoring the event, and to the great Northwest, which they have been such a large factor in developing, the committee believes that such a medal is fitting and proper and that this bill should be enacted into law."

South Dakota Senator <a href="Peter%20Norbeck">Peter Norbeck</a> also introduced legislation for a Norse-American medal on February 5, 1925. It was referred to the <a href="United%20States%20Congress%20Joint%20Committee%20on%20the%20Library">Committee on the Library</a>. On the 6th, that committee was discharged of responsibility for the bill and it was referred instead to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Banking%2C%20Housing%2C%20and%20Urban%20Affairs">Committee on Banking and Currency</a>. Norbeck, on behalf of the Banking Committee, reported the bill favorably and without amendment to the Senate on February 13. It was passed by the Senate without objection or amendment on the 18th.

The Senate-passed bill then was transmitted to the House of Representatives, and was referred to the Coinage Committee on February 20. It was brought forward on February 27, 1925. When the <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker</a>, <a href="Frederick%20H.%20Gillett">Frederick H. Gillett</a>, asked if there was objection to the consideration of the bill, Ohio's <a href="James%20T.%20Begg">James T. Begg</a> wanted to know if there was anyone present who could give him information about it, and if there was not, he would object. Kvale stated that he could, and when Begg inquired if <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="Andrew%20W.%20Mellon">Andrew W. Mellon</a> favored the bill, he assured the Ohioan that this was so. Kvale had the Senate-passed bill substituted for the one he had introduced, and it received the House's endorsement without objection or amendment. It was passed into law with the signature of President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> on March 2, 1925.

The act provided for a maximum of 40,000 medals, to be struck at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>, from design models prepared by the Norse-American Centennial Commission. Medals would be turned over to a designated agent of the commission on payment of the cost of producing them. They were to be made subject to the provisions of section 52 of the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Coinage Act of 1873</a>. That section permitted medals of a national character to be struck at the Philadelphia Mint, but forbade Mint personnel from making <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23D">dies</a> for private medals, and was enacted after Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner <a href="Franklin%20Peale">Franklin Peale</a> had for some years run a private medals business on Mint premises, prior to his firing in 1854.

Kvale hoped that his friend and fellow Minnesotan, Senator <a href="Henrik%20Shipstead">Henrik Shipstead</a>, could persuade sculptor <a href="Gutzon%20Borglum">Gutzon Borglum</a> to design the medal for no fee or a nominal one. Borglum, who was busy with construction at <a href="Stone%20Mountain">Stone Mountain</a> in Georgia (he would later sculpt <a href="Mount%20Rushmore">Mount Rushmore</a>), had designed the <a href="Stone%20Mountain%20Memorial%20half%20dollar">Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar</a>; he had no time to accept the work. <a href="Buffalo%20nickel">Buffalo nickel</a> designer <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a>, a member of the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>, was engaged for a fee of $1,500, about the usual for a commemorative coin.

Fraser prepared designs and submitted them to the Mint; O'Reilly sent them to the Commission of Fine Arts on April 14, 1925. The commission approved them; its only suggestion was that the first "the" be removed from the inscription on the reverse, "", and this was done. Sketches had been printed in the "<a href="Minneapolis%20Journal">Minneapolis Journal</a>" on March 29, provoking some reaction from those who felt that the design implied that Norwegians still dressed like Vikings in 1825, and that the date, 1000, should be moved from reverse to obverse to eliminate the confusion. The public objections had no effect on events.

The obverse of the medal shows a Norwegian Viking chieftain who has just come ashore from his ship (seen behind him) and is armed for war, with <a href="horned%20helmet">horned helmet</a>, shield, sword, and "svard" (dagger). He is intended to be landing at <a href="Vinland">Vinland</a>, the lands in the Americas explored and to some extent settled by the Vikings about the year 1000. The helmet is most likely an anachronism, as they are not believed to have been used for two millennia prior to the Vinland landing, and were probably ceremonial, rather than intended for battle. The centennial and the years are recognized on the obverse. The reverse shows a Viking ship, along with the authorization by Congress and the approximate year in which Vinland was settled. (Fraser's work), the artist's signature, is to the left of the ship.

Numismatist Anthony Swiatek, in his volume on commemoratives, wonders if <a href="Leif%20Erikson">Leif Erikson</a>, the famed explorer of that period, would not have been a superior choice. He concludes that Kvale would not have supported such a depiction, because "he was interested in pure romanticization. He saw a Viking ship and his chieftain in full regalia".

Julie Shultz, in her journal article on the 1925 celebration, finds it significant that the medal has nothing to do with the arrival of the "Restauration" in an already-formed United States, but symbolizes ethnic pride in the early explorers. Noting that one of the stamps depicts a Viking ship and the other the "Restauration", she concludes of these three government issues for the celebration: "Though outwardly, these souvenirs were to symbolize the Norwegian immigrant heritage that began in 1825, they actually invert the dominant narrative by using an American form to proclaim that Norwegians were the first Europeans to land on American soil."

Six thousand silver medals on a thin (1.6 mm) <a href="planchet">planchet</a> were struck between May 21 and 23, 1925, at the Philadelphia Mint. They were handled like ordinary coins: They were counted, bagged, and transported to the Fourth Street National Bank of Philadelphia for the centennial commission's use. Between May 29 and June 13, a total of 33,750 pieces were struck on a thick (2 mm) silver planchet. The reason for the two varieties is uncertain; Swiatek theorizes that the Norse-American Centennial Commission might not have liked how the thin ones looked, or might have wanted collectors to buy two medals. One hundred were struck in gold, on June 3 and 4—Kvale received the second one struck. The medals cost the commission 30 cents each for the thin ones, 45 cents for the thick, and $10.14 for the gold. The retail price of the thin ones is uncertain (Swiatek estimates $1.75), the thick ones are known to have cost $1.25, and the gold pieces about $20. They were sold by mail order; none were sold at the celebrations or in person. There was a sales limit of one per person, but purchasers could buy on behalf of as many family members as they wanted. The thin pieces were not offered for sale until November or December 1925, and sold mostly to numismatists—the commission's secretary, J.A. Horvik, was frustrated that more "Norsemen" were not buying the medal. After the celebrations, Kvale took 5,000 medals to New York, hoping to sell them, but was not successful. Of the 100 gold pieces struck, 47 were eventually returned to the Treasury when they could not be sold, and some of the silver pieces (most likely thick ones) were as well.

The <a href="Norse-American%20Centennial">Norse-American Immigration Centennial Celebration</a> was held at the <a href="Minnesota%20State%20Fair">Minnesota State Fair</a>grounds near Minneapolis from June 6–9, 1925. Automobile caravans were organized to bring attendees from the <a href="Red%20River%20Valley">Red River Valley</a>, bearing the slogan, "The Norsemen are Coming!" President Coolidge was present; he called the Viking explorers "these <a href="Norse%20mythology">sons of Thor and Odin</a>", and told attendees, "the pledge of the Norwegian people has never yet gone unredeemed. I have every faith that through the vigorous performance of your duties you will add new lustre to your glories in the days to come." "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" noted that commemorative stamps and a congressionally authorized medal had been issued for the celebration. "Seldom before has the celebration of a similar event been so honored by the Government, as has this centennial."

The "Times" had inaccurately described the medal as "the first commemorative medal to be issued in the history of the mint". The publicity people for the celebration had billed it as the first medal to be issued pursuant to an act of Congress, but in October 1925, Mint Director <a href="Robert%20J.%20Grant">Robert J. Grant</a> learned that a medal had been authorized by Congress for the centennial of American independence in 1876, and it had been issued in different sizes. He informed Kvale, who was intrigued by the fact that the independence medal had been issued in a 3-inch (76 mm) size. The congressman felt that the larger size would allow the detail of his medal to be better shown, which would help when one was exhibited in a museum display case. Not all members of his board were enthusiastic about the idea, but between 60 and 75 of these larger medals were struck, likely in December at the Philadelphia Mint, with Kvale undertaking to purchase any that were not sold. They were plated in silver by a private firm in Washington, D.C., and about 30 were presented or mailed to dignitaries, including one to President Coolidge.

The Norse-American medal is not a coin, and is not <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a>. Due to its similarity to a coin, and the fact that it was authorized by Congress, it is sometimes collected as part of the U.S. commemorative coin series. Though the silver ones can be purchased for less than $100 up to $500, and the silver-plated one for between $500 and $3,500, the gold specimen has sold for as high as $40,000. Some medals were used as pocket pieces or worn in mountings to the fair, and display damage or wear.

First Battle of Dernancourt

The First Battle of Dernancourt was fought on 28 March 1918 near <a href="Dernancourt">Dernancourt</a> in northern France during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. It involved a force of the German <a href="2nd%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">2nd Army</a> attacking elements of the <a href="VII%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">VII Corps</a>, which included British and Australian troops, and resulted in a complete defeat of the German assault.

The Australian <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">3rd</a> and <a href="4th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">4th Divisions</a> had been sent south from Belgium to help stem the tide of the German <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a> towards <a href="Amiens">Amiens</a> and, with the British <a href="35th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">35th Division</a>, they held a line west and north of the <a href="Ancre">Ancre</a> river and the area between the Ancre and <a href="Somme%20%28river%29">Somme</a>, forming the southern flank of the <a href="Third%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Third Army</a>. Much of the VII Corps front line consisted of a series of posts strung out along a railway embankment between <a href="Albert%2C%20Somme">Albert</a> and <a href="Buire-sur-l%27Ancre">Buire-sur-l'Ancre</a>. The main German assault force was the <a href="50th%20Reserve%20Division%20%28German%20Empire%29">50th Reserve Division</a> of the <a href="XXIII%20Reserve%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">XXIII Reserve Corps</a>, which concentrated its assault on the line between Albert and Dernancourt, attacking off the line of march after a short artillery preparation. Supporting attacks were to be launched by the <a href="13th%20Division%20%28German%20Empire%29">13th Division</a> further west. Some German commanders considered success unlikely unless the embankment was weakly held, and the commander of the German 2nd Army ordered the attack to be postponed, but that message did not reach the assaulting troops in time.

The Germans attacked at dawn under the cover of fog, but other than one small penetration by a <a href="company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> in the early morning that was quickly repelled, partly due to the actions of Sergeant <a href="Stanley%20McDougall">Stanley McDougall</a> of the Australian <a href="47th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">47th Battalion</a>, the Germans failed to break through the VII Corps defences. McDougall was awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, the highest award that could be received by an Australian soldier for gallantry in the face of the enemy. By late afternoon, rain set in, making early renewal of the assault less likely. The Germans suffered about 550 casualties during the battle, and the Australians lost at least 137 killed or wounded. The British 35th Division suffered 1,540 casualties from 25 to 30 March. In the week following the battle, the Germans renewed their attempts to advance in the sector, culminating in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Dernancourt">Second Battle of Dernancourt</a> on 5 April, when the Germans were defeated in desperate fighting.

After the <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20Ypres">Third Battle of Ypres</a> petered out in late 1917, the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> fell into its usual lull over the winter months. In early 1918, it became apparent to the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allies</a> that a large German offensive was pending. This <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a> commenced on 21 March 1918, with over one million men in three German <a href="field%20army">armies</a> striking hard just north of the junction between the French and British armies. The main effort of this offensive hit the British <a href="Third%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Third</a> and <a href="Fifth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Fifth</a> Armies, which formed the right flank of the British front line. Struck a series of staggering blows, a breach between the two British armies developed, and they were forced into a rapid, and in parts disorganised withdrawal, suffering heavy losses. The key railway junction at <a href="Amiens">Amiens</a> was soon threatened.

Shortly after the Spring Offensive began, the Australian <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">3rd</a> and <a href="4th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">4th Divisions</a> were deployed south in stages from rest areas in the <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> region of Belgium to the <a href="Somme%20%28river%29">Somme river valley</a> in France to help stem the German offensive. Initially it was intended to use them to launch a counter-offensive, but this idea was soon shelved due to German successes. On their way south, the <a href="4th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">4th Brigade</a> was detached from the 4th Division to help halt the Germans near <a href="H%C3%A9buterne">Hébuterne</a> in the centre of the Third Army sector. Travelling by train, bus and marching on foot, the remaining two brigades of the 4th Division, the <a href="12th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">12th</a> and <a href="13th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">13th Brigades</a>, concentrated in the area west of <a href="Dernancourt">Dernancourt</a>, under the command of the <a href="VII%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">VII Corps</a> led by <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Walter%20Norris%20Congreve">Walter Norris Congreve</a>, which now formed the right flank of the Third Army.

The commander of the 4th Division, <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="Ewen%20Sinclair-Maclagan">Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan</a>, was ordered to support and then relieve remnants of the <a href="9th%20%28Scottish%29%20Division">9th (Scottish) Division</a>, which was holding the front line along a railway between <a href="Albert%2C%20Somme">Albert</a> and Dernancourt, west of the <a href="Ancre">Ancre</a> river. This task was given to the 12th Brigade, under the command of <a href="Brigadier%20General">Brigadier General</a> <a href="John%20Gellibrand">John Gellibrand</a>. The 13th Brigade was held in support positions between <a href="Bresle">Bresle</a> and <a href="Ribemont-sur-Ancre">Ribemont-sur-Ancre</a>. To the right of the 12th Brigade was the British <a href="35th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">35th Division</a>, positioned between Dernancourt and <a href="Buire-sur-l%27Ancre">Buire-sur-l'Ancre</a>, and commanded by Brigadier General <a href="Arthur%20Marindin">Arthur Marindin</a>. That division had been involved in a series of fighting withdrawals since being committed to battle on 25 March near <a href="Cl%C3%A9ry-sur-Somme">Cléry-sur-Somme</a>, some east of Dernancourt. The 3rd Division, commanded by Major General <a href="John%20Monash">John Monash</a>, was deployed further to the south, between the Ancre and the Somme around <a href="Morlancourt">Morlancourt</a>, with its <a href="10th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">10th Brigade</a> to the right of the 35th Division.

From before midnight on 27 March, the now tired 12th Brigade had been holding the railway line between Albert and Dernancourt, having relieved the 9th (Scottish) Division. The forward positions of the <a href="Salient%20%28military%29">salient</a> held by the 12th Brigade were along the railway line, which ran along a series of embankments and cuttings, up to but not including a railway bridge immediately northwest of Dernancourt where the Dernancourt–<a href="Lavi%C3%A9ville">Laviéville</a> road passed under the railway. Northwest of Dernancourt, a mushroom-shaped feature known as the Laviéville Heights overlooked the railway line, which curved around its foot. This was difficult ground to defend, particularly where the railway line curved and skirted the northwestern corner of Dernancourt, as the outskirts of the village were very close to the railway line at this point, and provided good concealment for approaching enemy troops. If the line there was overrun, the enemy would be able to fire into the rear of the troops deployed along the railway in both directions. Despite this, the Australian commanders considered it important to hold the railway line; if it was not garrisoned, the enemy could assemble in the dead ground behind the embankment. A further difficulty arose from the fact that if an attack occurred during daylight, it would be almost impossible to move troops down the exposed slopes to reinforce the railway line without crippling losses, and troops withdrawing from the railway line would be similarly exposed. To afford them some protection along the railway line, the forward posts dug one-man niches in the near side of the embankment, but the only way for them to fire was to climb up and lie on top of the embankment, thus exposing themselves to enemy fire.

On the left of the brigade front, with its northern flank short of the Albert–Amiens road, was the <a href="48th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">48th Battalion</a>, commanded by <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="Raymond%20Leane">Raymond Leane</a>. To its left was the British <a href="12th%20%28Eastern%29%20Division">12th (Eastern) Division</a> of <a href="V%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">V Corps</a>. The 48th Battalion was holding its sector with two <a href="company%20%28military%20unit%29">companies</a> in a series of posts along alternate cuttings and embankments of the railway line as it ran south from Albert. Close to that town the railway line was not in VII Corps hands, and the posts were thrown back along the side of a gully short of the Albert–Amiens road, in contact with the southern posts of the 12th (Eastern) Division, which extended south of the road at this point. The battalion frontage was about . The 48th Battalion support line was located about to the rear on the high ground, astride the Albert–Amiens road. Due to the curvature of the slope, the two companies in the support line were out of sight of its forward companies at the railway line.

On the right of the 48th Battalion was the <a href="47th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">47th Battalion</a>, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Alexander%20Imlay">Alexander Imlay</a>, with its two forward companies also strung out along the railway line. The total frontage of the 47th Battalion was , which meant that the 180–200 men of the forward companies were positioned in widely spaced posts. Between the forward companies was a section of embankment near a level crossing which was not garrisoned, but was covered from a shallow cutting to the south and a low embankment to the north. The 47th Battalion's support line was also located on the hill some distance to the rear. The <a href="4th%20Machine%20Gun%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">12th Machine Gun Company</a> was deployed with eight of its <a href="Vickers%20machine%20gun">Vickers machine gun</a>s in each battalion area, mainly sited along the railway line. Leane and Imlay had their headquarters co-located on the summit next to the Albert–Amiens road. Of the two remaining battalions of the 12th Brigade, the <a href="45th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">45th Battalion</a> was deployed on the slope behind the <a href="106th%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">106th Brigade</a> of the 35th Division, and the <a href="46th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">46th Battalion</a> was held in reserve near the village of <a href="Millencourt">Millencourt</a>.

On the right of the 12th Brigade were elements of the 35th Division, the first of these was the <a href="List%20of%20Northumberland%20Fusiliers%20battalions%20in%20World%20War%20I">19th (Service) Battalion (2nd Tyneside Pioneers)</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Northumberland%20Fusiliers">Northumberland Fusiliers</a> (19th NF), commanded by Lieutenant Colonel W.P.S.Foord. It was deployed near the railway arch on the northwestern outskirts of Dernancourt. The right-hand gun of the 12th Machine Gun Company was positioned with this unit, which was under the control of the 106th Brigade. To their right the 106th Brigade was deployed along the railway line as far as Buire-sur-l'Ancre, the front line there being held by the 17th (Service) Battalion, <a href="Royal%20Scots">Royal Scots</a>, and the 12th (Service) Battalion, <a href="Highland%20Light%20Infantry">Highland Light Infantry</a>. This section of the railway ran along flat ground. On its right, the <a href="104th%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">104th Brigade</a> line ran from Buire-sur-l'Ancre past <a href="Treux">Treux</a>, its forward battalions being the 18th (Service) Battalion (2nd South East Lancashire) of the <a href="Lancashire%20Fusiliers">Lancashire Fusiliers</a>, and the 19th (Service) Battalion, <a href="Durham%20Light%20Infantry">Durham Light Infantry</a>. The 104th Brigade overlapped and sheltered the left flank of the 10th Brigade of the 3rd Division, which was deployed just east of <a href="M%C3%A9ricourt-l%27Abb%C3%A9">Méricourt-l'Abbé</a>. The VII Corps positions had excellent observation of the surrounding countryside, but were tactically weak.

A significant amount of artillery support was available to the defenders. The divisional artillery of the 4th Division, consisting of the 10th and 11th <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Artillery">Australian Field Artillery</a> (AFA) Brigades, were within range, as were the British 50th and 65th <a href="Royal%20Field%20Artillery">Royal Field Artillery</a> (RFA) Brigades. The S.O.S. lines of the 10th AFA Brigade were on a copse south of Albert, ahead of the 48th Battalion and those of the 11th AFA Brigade were on the far side of Dernancourt. The Australian batteries were in the open, as pits had not yet been dug for them due to their recent arrival.

The main German attack was to be made by the <a href="50th%20Reserve%20Division%20%28German%20Empire%29">50th Reserve Division</a> of "<a href="General%20of%20the%20Infantry%20%28Germany%29">General der Infanterie</a>" <a href="Hugo%20von%20Kathen">Hugo von Kathen</a>'s <a href="XXIII%20Reserve%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">XXIII Reserve Corps</a>. The 50th Reserve Division was a <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n division that had been involved in the Spring Offensive from the outset. It had a few days' rest before the advance was delayed by the British at Albert and Dernancourt and its morale was still high. The right prong of the attack would be made by the 229th Reserve Infantry Regiment (RIR) advancing through the <a href="9th%20Reserve%20Division%20%28German%20Empire%29">9th Reserve Division</a> north of Dernancourt against the sector held by the 48th Battalion. The left prong would consist of the 230th RIR, advancing from the area of Morlancourt through Dernancourt against the 47th Battalion and 19th NF. In this sector, I Battalion of the 230th RIR (I/230 RIR) would cross the Ancre and seize Dernancourt, then III Battalion, 230 RIR (III/230 RIR) would assault the embankment. After the capture of the embankment, the assaulting troops would push northwest over the Albert–Amiens road, then advance west towards Amiens. II Battalion, 230 RIR (II/230 RIR) was to follow up the assault of III/230 RIR. Both regimental commanders considered that the plan could only succeed if the embankment was weakly held and made representations to their brigade commander, to no avail. The German artillery preparation was to last only 45 minutes.

Further west, supporting attacks were to be launched by the <a href="13th%20Division%20%28German%20Empire%29">13th Division</a>, with the 15th Infantry Regiment (IR) assaulting across the Ancre towards the front line held by the 106th Brigade between Dernancourt and Buire-sur-l'Ancre and then exploiting success by driving west towards the village of Ribemont-sur-Ancre. The 13th IR was to attack the 104th Brigade at Marrett Wood. The German artillery preparation was to start at 05:15 on 28 March, and the assault to begin at 06:00. During the night of 27/28 March, the commander of the German <a href="2nd%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">2nd Army</a> apparently came to the same conclusion as the regimental commanders of the 50th Reserve Division, as at 03:00 he ordered the attack to be delayed until noon, and later further postponed it, but the orders did not reach the divisions in time.

During the night of 27/28 March, patrols of the 47th Battalion had observed German troops on the Albert–Dernancourt road, on the open flats just across the railway line, but the night passed without obvious signs of attack. Early in the morning, the German artillery fell heavily on the support lines and rear area, but initially was very light along the railway line. In the thick mist of early dawn, the commander of a small post of the 47th Battalion, stationed behind the embankment immediately north of the level crossing, heard the sound of bayonet scabbards flapping on the thighs of marching troops. Sergeant <a href="Stanley%20McDougall">Stanley McDougall</a> woke his comrades and they ran to alert nearby elements of the battalion. McDougall, running along the top of the embankment, saw German troops of II Battalion, 229 RIR (II/229 RIR) advancing along the whole front through the mist. Returning with a handful of men, he planned to deploy them behind the unmanned bank to the south. By this time, Germans were throwing <a href="hand%20grenade">hand grenade</a>s over the embankment, and one exploded near a <a href="Lewis%20machine%20gun">Lewis machine gun</a> team in front of McDougall, badly wounding the two-man crew. McDougall, who had previously been a Lewis gunner, grabbed the gun and began to fire it from the hip as he went. First he shot down two German light machine gun teams as they tried to cross the rails, then, running along the enemy edge of the embankment, saw about 20 Germans waiting for the signal to assault. He turned the gun on them, and as they ran, followed them with its fire. By this time, several of his comrades had been killed or wounded.

Other members of the 47th Battalion had garrisoned the northern end of the previously unoccupied bank, but the southern half remained open. A group of about 50 Germans of the 6th Company of II/229 RIR, advancing earlier than planned, had overrun the Lewis gun team covering the level crossing, and began advancing southwards behind the embankment to the rear of the right forward company of the battalion. Seeing their movement, McDougall and others opened fire on them. The barrel casing of McDougall's Lewis gun had grown so hot that his left hand became blistered, but he continued to fire it with the help of another sergeant. Of the party of Germans who had penetrated about beyond the railway line, two officers and 20 men had already been killed. Australian troops converged on the remaining Germans, and they quickly surrendered. A total of one officer and 29 men were captured. For his actions that morning, McDougall was later awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, the highest award that could be received by an Australian soldier for gallantry in the face of the enemy.

By this time, the rest of the front line between Albert to beyond Dernancourt was also being heavily attacked. In the north, forward troops of the 48th Battalion were firing almost continuously from the railway line. Attacked by elements of III Battalion, 229 RIR (III/229 RIR) supported by "<a href="minenwerfer">minenwerfer</a>s" firing from a copse south of Albert, the 48th Battalion easily beat off every German assault. This was despite being caught in <a href="Enfilade%20and%20defilade">enfilade</a> by a machine gun sited on the bridge where the Albert–Amiens road crossed the railway line. Leane directed artillery onto the wood south of Albert from which the "minenwerfers" were firing. This was the same wood upon which the S.O.S. line of the 10th AFA Brigade had been laid. Just as the Germans were assembling for a renewed assault, a stray British shell exploded a munitions dump, scattering panicked troops of II/229 RIR, many of whom were then shot down by the Australians. The 48th lost only three officers and 59 men during the day's fighting. Wary of sending reinforcements from his support line down the exposed slope to the railway line, Leane only sent four men with two Lewis guns forward during the daylight hours. During the day, the right of the 48th was steadily extended to allow the 47th Battalion to move right in turn.

The 47th Battalion's sector was also being heavily attacked by II/229 RIR, and apart from the initial penetration by the 6th Company, they also held the German assault, with assistance from the Lewis guns of the 48th Battalion on their left, who caught the advancing Germans in enfilade. On one occasion a party of the left forward company of the battalion charged over the embankment, chasing the Germans back across the flats into some buildings, and then forcing them out of that cover. Exposed to heavy fire, this small force withdrew back to the railway embankment by noon. When he received reports of the German assault, Imlay sent two platoons of his right support company forward to reinforce the right flank of the battalion front line. However, the exposed slope between the two positions was swept by German machine gun fire and shell fire, and the men could only be sent forward in rushes, well spread out, so this took some time and they suffered casualties. Soon after their arrival, the right forward company inflicted heavy casualties on another German attempt to rush the embankment. Imlay later sent another platoon to reinforce the left flank, and a carrying party with a resupply of hand grenades. In the meantime, Gellibrand placed the 45th Battalion at Imlay's disposal, although they did not immediately move forward from their position behind the 106th Brigade. German engineers attempted to place <a href="pontoon%20bridge">pontoon bridge</a>s across the Ancre north of Dernancourt to allow assembling troops to cross, but the pontoons were soon riddled and many engineers killed and wounded by guns of the 12th Machine Gun Company. When Imlay became aware of this concentration of German troops, he ordered a company of the 45th Battalion to move to his support lines. During the day, the 47th Battalion suffered 75 casualties.

The German artillery bombardment was heaviest in the sector held by the right company of the 47th Battalion and the 19th NF on either side of the railway bridge northwest of Dernancourt. About 05:00, I/230 RIR began advancing down the slope from the line of the Morlancourt–Méaulte road in three waves, and was quickly met by Lewis gun fire from the 19th NF, which broke up the movement. The German battalion had barely been able to reach its jumping off point in time, and fell behind its barrage. It continued to advance through the Australian and British barrage south of Dernancourt and quickly moved through the village, part of the battalion reaching the railway embankment. About 09:30, the German shelling in the sector near the bridge lessened. The commander of the right section of the 12th Machine Gun Company, stationed near the bridge with the 19th NF, climbed up the embankment and looking over the rails, saw German bayonets sticking up on the other side. After a quick discussion with the ranking officer of the 19th NF in that area, it was decided they would attack immediately. Charging across the railway line, they pushed the German force back far enough to bring one of the Vickers guns into action. The fire from this gun drove the Germans of I/230 RIR back as far as Dernancourt. Before this <a href="counter-attack">counter-attack</a> was launched, Foord, feeling his position to be insecure, requested reinforcement. Two companies of the 18th (Service) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry, were sent forward from the 106th Brigade support line, arriving around the time of the counter-attack, although they suffered significant casualties as they moved down the exposed slope. II and III/230 RIR were unable to get through Dernancourt to reinforce I/230 RIR, due to a tremendous Australian and British bombardment that fell on the village as they approached. They sought shelter in the cellars of the village. Any troops that attempted to cross the open ground between the village and the railway were shot down.

About 10:00, a German force estimated at around two battalions in strength emerged from the village and lined out about from the embankment among the hedgerows and gardens at the edge of the village. At the same time, a German barrage fell heavily about 200 yards behind the defending troops along the railway line. As ammunition was running low, resupply parties were sent forward from the support line, and the dead and wounded were stripped of what ammunition they had left. This renewed German pressure was focussed mainly on the left forward company of the 19th NF that held the railway bridge, which managed to push a Lewis gun team forward of the embankment to enfilade the assembling Germans. The German barrage increased about 10:25, and casualties mounted among the 19th NF. One of these was Foord, who was wounded in the neck but remained at his post.

From the attack near the railway bridge it became clear that Dernancourt was in German hands, despite a previous assumption that it was still held by patrols of the 35th Division. After the heavy shelling of the village, reports were received that the Germans were withdrawing. About 12:30, the commander of the 106th Brigade requested that the artillery fire on the village stop at 14:00 so he could send patrols into the village in an attempt to secure it. He was unable to mount a proper attack due to losses. He asked Gellibrand to extend the right flank of his line to include the railway bridge to free up his troops to go forward. Imlay was ordered to do this, and to follow up any success the 19th NF achieved, but according to the author of a 47th Battalion history, Craig Deayton, this push into Dernancourt had a "ridiculously optimistic" objective, as the German strength in the village was obvious from the attacks that had been mounted from it. Imlay also directed the attached company of the 45th to move down to that sector from his support line as soon as the 19th NF went forward. In the event, the pioneers launched an attack by the remnants of two companies, totalling about 100 men. According to Deayton, once they left the cover of the embankment, they came under heavy machine gun fire from the village, suffered significant casualties and withdrew to their start line. A different version is provided by Davson, the historian of the 35th Division, who states that the 19th NF attack achieved success that was "immediate and remarkable", driving the Germans back into the village leaving many machine guns behind. The 47th did not follow up the pioneers in going forward towards Dernancourt.

The move of the company of the 45th Battalion down the exposed slope was disastrous, possibly as the company commander had not been advised of the particular difficulties involved. Moving in artillery formation, they were shelled and came under intense machine gun fire; 11 men being killed and 37 wounded. The survivors scrambled to the embankment in small groups. Although the "<a href="Official%20History%20of%20Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201914%E2%80%931918">Official History</a>" is silent on who was responsible for this debacle, in his notebooks, the official historian, <a href="Charles%20Bean">Charles Bean</a>, blamed Imlay.
About 18:00, Gellibrand optimistically ordered the 47th to push into Dernancourt, but they met massed machine gun fire from the village as soon as they began and quickly retired to the railway line. Deayton describes the two attacks on the village as "ill conceived" and the losses incurred unnecessary, as it was obvious to the troops on the railway line that the village was strongly held by the Germans.

The far left flank of the German attack fell on the 104th Brigade near the village of Treux, although with the line south of the Ancre in this area, the defenders were less subject to surprise and had good fields of fire. A post of the 18th (Service) Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers was located in a deep sunken road in the northeast corner of Marrett Wood, which was southwest of Treux itself. On the evening of 27 March, Monash had ordered the 10th Brigade to establish if the 35th Division really held the wood, and patrols of the <a href="37th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">37th Battalion</a> had located the British post in the sunken road and provided some support, consisting of a few snipers and a Lewis gun crew which was low on ammunition. About 06:00, a small German attack was launched in this sector, but it was repelled with Lewis gun fire. About 08:00, Germans were seen approaching in the distance, and the commander of the Lancashire Fusiliers post asked the 37th Battalion for greater support. Before this could arrive, several hundred Germans of II/13 IR attacked, but they were beaten off by the combined British-Australian force at Marrett Wood with the help of the British artillery. The rest of 13 IR attacked further east around the village of Ville, but were easily stopped by the main line of the 106th Brigade. In response to the Lancashire Fusiliers' request for reinforcements, a company of the <a href="38th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">38th Battalion</a> occupied Marrett Wood about 11:35, just as another unsuccessful German assault was mounted. A further unsuccessful attempt was made at 16:30. The Germans blamed lack of adequate artillery support for their failure to capture Treux and Marrett Wood.

Throughout the day, the Australian and British artillery fired on German assembly areas east and south of the railway line. About 16:00, warning was received of a possible German attack north of the Albert–Amiens road, so Gellibrand advised the 46th Battalion, then in reserve, that they might be needed to combine with a company of <a href="Medium%20Mark%20A%20Whippet">Medium Mark A Whippet</a> tanks to help repel the forecast attack. About this time, a light drizzle began to fall, and the attack never came. Half an hour after this warning, Germans of III/230 RIR supported by elements of I and II/230 RIR, were seen filtering into houses on the southern outskirts of Albert in the 48th Battalion sector. Artillery was directed into this area, which drove the Germans out again. By 17:00, German troops could be seen withdrawing east in the distance. By this time, the troops of the 12th Brigade had been "moving, marching and fighting for three days and three nights almost without sleep", and were in a state of exhaustion. Increasing rain into the evening made renewal of the German effort less likely. In all, nine attacks were mounted by the Germans on the railway line during the day, and all but the brief penetration into the 47th Battalion sector were beaten off, although the defending troops had suffered significant casualties in doing so. According to Deayton, the defensive deficiencies of the forward positions along the railway line were obvious.

The attacks of 28 March were a continuation of the rapid advances that had caused the withdrawal of the hard-pressed Fifth Army since the first days of the Spring Offensive. Prisoners of war taken by the 48th Battalion attested to the fact that this was not a set-piece assault but merely an attack off the line of march with minimal preparation. The 50th Reserve Division was in no state to renew the offensive on the following day, and 229 RIR was withdrawn from the line. It had suffered 309 casualties, and 230 RIR had lost another 240.

Despite the withdrawal of the 50th and 65th RFA Brigades on 29 March, the Australian artillery continued to batter Dernancourt, causing another 83 casualties to 230 RIR who were garrisoning the village. The German attempt to renew their advance between Albert and Buire-sur-l'Ancre on 28 March had been completely defeated. Australian casualties amounted to at least 137 killed or wounded, and from 25 to 30 March, the 35th Division suffered 1,540 casualties. The battalions of the 12th and 13th Brigades were awarded the <a href="battle%20honour">battle honour</a> "Somme 1918" in part for their participation in the battle.

The Germans made two more minor and unsuccessful assaults on the railway embankment south of Albert on 1 and 3 April, then renewed their offensive in this sector with a determined push on 5 April which was eventually defeated by the 4th Division after desperate fighting during the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Dernancourt">Second Battle of Dernancourt</a>. Elsewhere, the Australian 3rd Division fought a sharp action during the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Morlancourt">First Battle of Morlancourt</a> over the period 28–30 March, followed by heavy fighting further south around <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Villers-Bretonneux">Villers-Bretonneux</a> in early April.

Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies

Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies is a music <a href="reference%20book">reference book</a> by American music journalist and essayist <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a>. It was first published in October 1981 by <a href="Ticknor%20%26amp%3B%20Fields">Ticknor & Fields</a>.

The book compiles approximately 3,000 of Christgau's <a href="capsule%20review">capsule</a> album reviews, most of which were originally written for his "Consumer Guide" column in "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" throughout the 1970s. The entries feature annotated details about each record's release and cover a variety of genres related to <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a>. Many of the older reviews were rewritten for the guide to reflect his changed perspective and matured stylistic approach, informed by an interest in the aesthetic and political dimensions of <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a> and a desire to communicate his ideas to readers in an entertaining, provocative way.

The guide was critically well received, earning praise for its extensive <a href="discography">discography</a>, Christgau's judgment and colorful writing. Reviewers noted his opinionated tastes, analytical commentary, pithy language, and critical quips. The book appeared on several expert lists of popular music literature. A staple of <a href="Album%20era">rock-era</a> reference works, "Christgau's Record Guide" became widely popular in libraries as a source for <a href="popular%20music%20studies">popular music studies</a> and as an authoritative guide for fellow critics, record collectors, and music shops.

"Christgau's Record Guide" has been <a href="reprint">reprint</a>ed several times in book form and later on Christgau's website in its entirety. Two more "Consumer Guide" collections have been published, compiling his capsule reviews from and , respectively.

In 1969, <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> began reviewing contemporary <a href="album">album</a> releases in his "Consumer Guide" column, which was published more-or-less monthly in "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>", and for brief periods in "<a href="Newsday">Newsday</a>" and "<a href="Creem">Creem</a>" magazine during the 1970s. His method was to select about 20 albums to review in <a href="capsule%20review">capsule</a> format, averaging approximately 50 words each, and to assign each album a <a href="Grading%20in%20education">letter grade</a> rating on a scale from to . The column was a product of "The Village Voice"s deal with Christgau—allotting him one 2,500-word piece per month—and his desire to provide prospective buyers with ratings of albums, including those that did not receive significant radio <a href="airplay">airplay</a>. Some of Christgau's early columns were reprinted in his first book, "Any Old Way You Choose It", a 1973 anthology of essays previously published in the "Voice" and "Newsday".

Among the most revered and influential of the earliest <a href="rock%20criticism">rock critics</a>, Christgau wrote the "Consumer Guide" with confidence in his tastes, conviction that <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a> could be consumed intelligently, and interest in finding new understandings of the aesthetic and political dimensions in <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a>'s intersection with the <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a>. As a journalist, he wanted to convey his findings in a way that would entertain and provoke readers.

In the late 1970s, Christgau conceived of a book that would collect reviews from his columns through that decade. He began to pitch "Christgau's Record Guide" to publishers in early 1979 and received a publishing deal shortly thereafter. He soon realized that the proposed book would not adequately represent the decade unless he significantly revised and expanded his existing columns. He believed his existing body of reviews overlooked important musical artists and would likely comprise less than two-thirds of the needed material for the book. In July of that year, he took a vacation from "The Village Voice" and left New York City for Maine with his wife, fellow writer <a href="Carola%20Dibbell">Carola Dibbell</a>, to work on the book. They chartered a boathouse and brought with them a <a href="High%20fidelity">stereo system</a> and numerous <a href="LP%20record">LP record</a>s. As Christgau recalled in his memoir "<a href="Going%20Into%20the%20City">Going Into the City</a>"(2015), "I had hundreds of records to find out about, hundreds to find, hundreds to re-review, hundreds to touch up."

Christgau continued working on the book after his return to New York. He was aided significantly by access to the record library of his neighbor, fellow journalist <a href="Vince%20Aletti">Vince Aletti</a>, who owned all of <a href="James%20Brown">James Brown</a>'s scarcely catalogued <a href="Polydor%20Records">Polydor</a> LPs from the 1970s. Beginning with Brown, Christgau re-examined the discographies of major artists in a chronological manner to curtail a sense of hindsight in the writing. "When possible", he said, "I piled on the <a href="record%20changer">changer</a> artists I actually felt like hearing that day in a ploy intended to scare up the excited little feeling in the pit of my stomach without which I am loath to give any album an A." The work intensified in 1980; from the beginning of February to the end of July he spent every day preparing the book. Recounting in his memoir, he said he worked 14 hours daily while "in book mode", which "was so grueling that for most of 1980 I was barely aware of the music of the moment, the only such hiatus in what is now fifty years."

Christgau's intense immersion into preparing the book also put a strain on his marriage to Dibbell, as did their efforts to overcome <a href="infertility">infertility</a>. In his words, the guide almost ruined his personal life: "We postponed further parenthood strategization. We hardly ever went out. The apartment sank to new depths of disarray as LPs and paper migrated into the dining room. And since I was home every minute with the stereo on, my life partner could never be alone, with herself or with her work." Dibbell's admission of an affair at the time led to a brief <a href="Trial%20separation">separation</a> before she and Christgau reunited with a stronger commitment to each other, reflected in the book's <a href="Dedication%20%28publishing%29">dedication</a>: "TO CAROLA – NEVER AGAIN." As they mended their relationship, Christgau slowed down his work pace in August 1980 while allowing Dibbell to "provide the tough edits I needed". In his memoir, he paid tribute to her influence on his work: "Her aesthetic responsiveness was unending ... no one affected my writing like Carola". Christgau finished the guide in mid-September, submitting the manuscript a few weeks late of his publisher's deadline.

"Christgau's Record Guide" collects approximately 3,000 "Consumer Guide" reviews of albums through the 1970s. The reviews are arranged alphabetically by artist name and accompanied by annotations for each record. Christgau regraded some older albums to reflect his changed perspective, while omitting other records and text from the original columns in favor of new material. Much of the material was previously unpublished, as more than half of the original reviews were expanded and extensively revised by Christgau for the guide, especially those covering the decade's first half. "Much of the early CG material was rewritten for the book for a reason", Christgau explained: "I didn't evolve my current high-density stylistic approach until 1975 or so". He wanted to retain parts of the original text as much as possible, "not just to poach language but to inject what sense of the moment I could".

The book covers albums from a variety of rock-related genres including <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a>, <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a>, <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a>, <a href="funk">funk</a>, <a href="disco">disco</a>, <a href="soul%20music">soul</a>, <a href="blues">blues</a>, <a href="country%20music">country</a>, and <a href="reggae">reggae</a>. With regard to its scope, Christgau said he "tried to grade every '70s rock album worth owning". The reviews often feature analytical commentary on the aesthetic or cultural significance of the music, as well as critical <a href="one-liner%20joke">one-liner joke</a>s. For example, his review of the <a href="Leonard%20Cohen">Leonard Cohen</a> album "<a href="Live%20Songs">Live Songs</a>"(1973) states Cohen "risks turning into the <a href="Pete%20Seeger">Pete Seeger</a> of romantic existentialism", while <a href="the%20Doobie%20Brothers">the Doobie Brothers</a>' "<a href="Takin%27%20It%20to%20the%20Streets%20%28The%20Doobie%20Brothers%20album%29">Takin' It to the Streets</a>"(1976) is panned in a single sentence: "<a href="wikt%3Ayou%20can%20lead%20a%20horse%20to%20water%2C%20but%20you%20can%27t%20make%20it%20drink">You can lead a Doobie to the recording studio, but you can't make him think.</a>"

The book is appended with introductory essays by Christgau, including a historical overview of rock and an explanation of his grading system; an record is defined as "an organically conceived masterpiece that repays prolonged listening", while "E records are frequently cited as proof that there is no God." The last section of the book, titled "A Basic Record Library", lists the albums he regarded as the essential records of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, respectively.

"Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies" was first published in October 1981 by <a href="Ticknor%20%26amp%3B%20Fields">Ticknor & Fields</a> in <a href="New%20Haven%2C%20Connecticut">New Haven, Connecticut</a>. It was released at a time when bookstores saw an influx of rock music reference books as publishers competed with one another for the market. The book was published in the United Kingdom the following year through the <a href="London">London</a>-based <a href="Ebury%20Publishing">Vermilion</a> imprint, and was <a href="reprint">reprint</a>ed in 1985 by <a href="Houghton%20Mifflin">Houghton Mifflin</a> in New York.

In 1990, "Christgau's Record Guide" was reprinted by <a href="Da%20Capo%20Press">Da Capo Press</a> under the title "Rock Albums of the Seventies: A Critical Guide". In the reprint's introduction, Christgau said he had revised some of the content. It was followed by "" that same year and "" in 2000, forming a three-volume series of books compiling the capsule reviews. The contents of all three "Consumer Guide" collections were made freely available on Christgau's website when it went online in 2001.

"Christgau's Record Guide" was well received in the popular music press during the 1980s. Reviewing the book in 1982 for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Robert%20Palmer%20%28writer%29">Robert Palmer</a> found it notable among the recent slew of rock reference publications "because it is both obsessively complete and caustically outspoken". He identified qualities of maturity, intelligence, and humor in Christgau's music criticism, and recommended the book as a valuable resource for those with a serious interest in contemporary rock, even if some of the opinions may prove divisive. "It is a bit too cantankerously opinionated to deserve an ," Palmer wrote, "but it certainly repays reading and rereading." Liam Lacey of "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>" called the guide "archly entertaining", while a reviewer for "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" said Christgau "writes beautifully, and his book is a provocative capsule history of '70s pop". <a href="Herb%20Hendler">Herb Hendler</a> named it among the books and magazines "relevant to youth and the rock era" in "Year by Year in the Rock Era"(1983), a chronicle of rock music's cultural impact from 1954 to 1982.

Steve Simels, who had been inspired to pursue a journalistic career by Christgau's early 1970s writing, ended up reviewing the book for "<a href="Stereo%20Review">Stereo Review</a>" and offered qualified praise. He regarded Christgau's reviews as indisputably well-written with fair-minded critical judgment, impressive witticisms and one-liners, and a deeper interest in <a href="black%20music">black music</a> than most other white critics. But Simels expressed reservations about what he perceived to be a mawkish sense of <a href="consciousness%20raising">feminist conscience</a>, "knee-jerk" <a href="modern%20liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States">liberal politics</a>, and a predilection for "conceptual music", exemplified by "A" grades for all four Ramones albums. After laboring through the entire guide, he found himself "surprised to discover how even-handed [Christgau]'s been over the long haul", and wrote in sum that it is worth reading, even if not entirely reliable. In "<a href="High%20Fidelity%20%28magazine%29">High Fidelity</a>", <a href="David%20Browne%20%28journalist%29">David Browne</a> said some of Christgau's musings would be too complicated for newcomers to rock journalism, but concluded that "he remains one of pop's most astute critics" and the guide functions best as a way of discovering good records—such as <a href="Bill%20Withers">Bill Withers</a>'s "<a href="Still%20Bill">Still Bill</a>" (1972)—otherwise obscured by the complex discography of 1970s popular music.

Some reviewers were more critical of the book. Fellow rock journalist <a href="Dave%20Marsh">Dave Marsh</a>, who had cited the "Consumer Guide" concept as an influence on his contemporaneous "<a href="Rolling%20Stone%20Record%20Guide">Rolling Stone Record Guide</a>", gave the collection a in "<a href="Musician%20%28magazine%29">Musician</a>". He found Christgau "concise, contentious, condescending, provocative and pedagogic" with a shrewd sense of judgment and sharp insight, but complained of gratuitous, off-topic commentary and possible attempts to keep up with fashionable consensus, as there were no clear indications which reviews had been rewritten in retrospect for the book. Marsh ultimately questioned whether Christgau's tough-mindedness and ideological rigidity made him ideal for a guide book and asked what it means if "the most influential rock critic has never written a book that wasn't an anthology". A response by Christgau was published in the magazine a few months later, in which he expressed appreciation for Marsh's "kind words" about the book and referred back to its introductory essay to answer questions posed in the review: 

British music scholar Paul Taylor issued different complaints about the book in his 1985 guide to literature on popular music, "Popular Music Since 1955". He called "Christgau's Record Guide" "an odd collection" for several reasons. "Included are certainly the best albums", he observed, "but it is the way in which the bad examples are selected that is dubious, and simply mediocre records are avoided."

Beyond the popular press, the book also garnered positive notice among academic journals focusing on reference works and curation of library collections. A review in "" magazine highly recommended the guide, arguing that it functions superbly as a read for spontaneous pleasure and a reference to rock's "major and minor classics" while highlighting the last section for librarians assembling a rock record collection. "Illinois Libraries", the journal publication of the <a href="Illinois%20Library%20Association">Illinois Library Association</a>, advised <a href="Audiovisual%20education">AV librarians</a> to consult the guide for help in selecting music recordings to archive. The journal's reviewer called Christgau "a senior critic if rock music has such a thing" and suggested readers focus less on his dislikes of artists like <a href="John%20Denver">John Denver</a> and more on his "well-founded and meaningful" enthusiasm for <a href="Terry%20Garthwaite">Terry Garthwaite</a>, <a href="Brian%20Eno">Brian Eno</a>, and The Ramones.

Lee Ash, general editor of the <a href="Haworth%20Press">Haworth Press</a>'s "Special Collections" journal, reviewed it as among books recommended to library <a href="special%20collections">special collections</a>. The guide's "quality, content, scope, and evaluative notes" impressed Ash, who had a greater familiarity with discographies of early <a href="chamber%20music">chamber music</a> and only a mild enthusiasm for rock music. He concluded it is an essential guide for music collection and providing "critical material for argument". In "<a href="Library%20Journal">Library Journal</a>", P. G. Feehan regarded Christgau as a rigorous, smart critic and the book an excellent companion to "The Rolling Stone Record Guide", particularly because of his extensive coverage of albums from fringe and import record labels. Feehan's one cavil was "his <a href="Four-letter%20word">four-letter-word</a>-studded, <a href="Hip%20%28slang%29">hip</a>/smart style, which may turn oft readers from west of the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a>".

"Christgau's Record Guide" and similar review collections played a role in the rise of rock critics as tastemakers, promoters, and cultural historians in the music industry, whose standards were being reinvented by rock music. These critics constructed their own versions of what popular music academic Roy Shuker called "the traditional <a href="High%20culture">high</a>/<a href="low%20culture">low culture</a> split, usually around notions of artistic integrity, authenticity, and the nature of commercialism". As with "The Rolling Stone Record Guide", "Christgau's Record Guide" became popular with music aficionados, collectors, and both secondhand and specialty record stores, who kept copies of different volumes on hand. Christgau's guides to the 1970s and 1980s were "bibles in the field", as Shuker described, "establishing orthodoxies as to the relative value of various styles or genres and pantheons of artists". While reviewing the 1980s volume for the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" in 1990, <a href="Greg%20Kot">Greg Kot</a> said "Christgau's Record Guide" and Ira Robbins's "<a href="Trouser%20Press">Trouser Press Record Guide</a>" had been "the bibles of my existence as a rock critic". Fellow critic <a href="Rob%20Sheffield">Rob Sheffield</a> named it among his six favorite books in a list published by "<a href="The%20Week">The Week</a>", believing other "obsessive music freaks" likely own it too. "This book is the all-time rock-'n'-roll argument starter", he said, "and I'll be arguing with it for the rest of my life." It was also read by novelists <a href="Dylan%20Hicks">Dylan Hicks</a> and <a href="Jonathan%20Lethem">Jonathan Lethem</a> when they were young adults; Lethem later revealed that "for years, I calibrated my record collection against the grades ... jotting dissenting views in pencil in the margins". In retrospect, Christgau said the book "greatly enhance[d] my personal profile as well as reaching readers I'm proud are still out there."

The guide was published in an era when <a href="popular%20music%20studies">popular music studies</a> were the domain of non-academic sources such as journalists rather than <a href="music%20department">music department</a>s and classical academics. It became widely popular in library catalogues by the late 1980s, along with other anthologized works of rock journalism by critics like <a href="Ellen%20Willis">Ellen Willis</a> and <a href="Lester%20Bangs">Lester Bangs</a>. The "Consumer Guide" reviews collected in the book were cited by Weisbard as part of rock and popular music's reinvention of critical standards. The end of the 20th century saw another paradigm shift, as paid journalism declined and academic departments gradually embraced popular music studies. In 1997, the <a href="Music%20Library%20Association">Music Library Association</a> used both 1970s and 1980s volumes as references to prepare select rock recordings for "A Basic Music Library: Essential Scores and Sound Recordings", published by the <a href="American%20Library%20Association">American Library Association</a> as a guide for librarians and other specialist collectors.

Christgau believed the 1970s guide was the most "authoritative" in the "Consumer Guide" book series because the decade's smaller music market was easier to process. He characterized the first volume as "a kind of canon-defining work, making the case for <a href="Van%20Morrison">Van Morrison</a> and, say, the <a href="Kate%20%26amp%3B%20Anna%20McGarrigle">McGarrigle sisters</a>, and against <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a> and, say, <a href="Donny%20Hathaway">Donny Hathaway</a>." In comparison to "The Rolling Stone Record Guide", Christgau said "I think mine is better, but that's not worth arguing. What's undeniable is that mine was written by one person, and was therefore an act of sensibility rather than cultural fiat, with no canonizing intention albeit some canonizing effect (which was soon nullified by the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> [in 1983], a status grab far more effective than any book)." In the two decades that followed, he felt the canon had grown "far murkier, vaster, and more various", and his personal taste had become more idiosyncratic and divergent from general critical consensus. According to "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>"s Ivan Kreilkamp, the "audacious, canon-defining work" remained the critic's most impactful work. In <a href="Eric%20Weisbard">Eric Weisbard</a>'s opinion, Christgau "wasn't so much canonizing as using the endless listening party to find new wrinkles in his, and popular music's, unsummarizable aesthetic".

"Christgau's Record Guide" has been regarded as "essential rock writing" by literary academic Cornel Bonca. <a href="Chuck%20Eddy">Chuck Eddy</a> included it in his buying guide to books on rock music, while <a href="Jon%20Savage">Jon Savage</a> recommended it as a useful discography of 1970s punk rock. In 2006, all three "Consumer Guide" books were collectively ranked fifth on "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>"s list of the 17 essential books about popular music; in the opinion of the list's writers, Christgau "made a sublime art of the capsule review, packing pithy observations and heartfelt appreciation into 150-word boxes". Michaelangelo Matos, a staff writer for the website, was greatly influenced by Christgau and said the first two volumes were books he had read most frequently as an adult. He highlighted Christgau's humor, ability to extract the essence of an album in a few sentences, and punctuating of reviews with letter grades, "a cunning rhetorical device as much as simple judgment". In 2016, "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" placed the first volume at number 47 on a list of the 100 greatest music books; an accompanying blurb read: "His '70s collection offers a fantastic primer on rock and soul's most fruitful decade. Whether or not you share Christgau's passion for <a href="Al%20Green">Al Green</a>'s 'Let's Get Married' or his disdain for all things <a href="Eagles%20%28band%29">Eagles</a>, you'll love his pith and wit."

Cracker Barrel

Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. is an American chain of combined <a href="restaurant">restaurant</a> and <a href="Variety%20store">gift stores</a> with a <a href="Culture%20of%20the%20Southern%20United%20States">Southern</a> country theme. The company was founded by <a href="Dan%20Evins">Dan Evins</a> in 1969; its first store was in <a href="Lebanon%2C%20Tennessee">Lebanon, Tennessee</a>. The corporate offices are located at a different facility in the same city. The chain's stores were at first positioned near <a href="Interstate%20highway">Interstate highway</a> exits in the <a href="Southeastern%20United%20States">Southeastern</a> and <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwestern</a> United States, but has expanded across the country during the 1990s and 2000s. , the chain operates 645 stores in 44 states.

Cracker Barrel's menu is based on traditional <a href="Cuisine%20of%20the%20Southern%20United%20States">Southern cuisine</a>, with appearance and decor designed to resemble an old-fashioned <a href="general%20store">general store</a>. Each restaurant features a front <a href="porch">porch</a> lined with wooden <a href="rocking%20chair">rocking chair</a>s, a stone <a href="fireplace">fireplace</a>, and decorative artifacts from the local area. Cracker Barrel partners with <a href="country%20music">country music</a> performers. It engages in charitable activities, such as its assistance of victims of <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> and injured war veterans.
Employees there wear a choice of either white, yellow, blue or pink shirts.

During the 1990s, the company was the subject of controversy for its official stance against gay and lesbian employees and for discriminatory practices against African-American customers and female employees. In 2004, a <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Justice">U.S. Department of Justice</a> (USDOJ) investigation found that Cracker Barrel discriminated against <a href="Minority%20group">minority</a> customers; patrons complained of <a href="Racial%20segregation">racially segregated</a> seating and service quality. In an agreement with the USDOJ, Cracker Barrel implemented non-discrimination policies and pledged to focus on improving minority representation and civic involvement, particularly in the black community. Company shareholders added <a href="sexual%20orientation">sexual orientation</a> to the company's non-discrimination policy in 2002.

Cracker Barrel was founded in 1969 by <a href="Dan%20Evins">Dan Evins</a>, a sales representative for <a href="Royal%20Dutch%20Shell">Shell Oil</a>, who developed the restaurant and gift store concept initially as a plan to improve <a href="gasoline">gasoline</a> sales. Designed to resemble the traditional country store that he remembered from his childhood, with a name chosen to give it a Southern country theme, Cracker Barrel was intended to attract the interest of highway travelers. The first restaurant was built close to <a href="Interstate%2040">Interstate 40</a>, in <a href="Lebanon%2C%20Tennessee">Lebanon, Tennessee</a>. It opened in September 1969, serving Southern cuisine including <a href="Biscuit%20%28bread%29">biscuits</a>, <a href="grits">grits</a>, country ham, and <a href="Turnip%23Description">turnip greens</a>.

Evins <a href="Incorporation%20%28business%29">incorporated</a> Cracker Barrel in February 1970, and soon opened more locations. In the early 1970s, the firm leased land on gasoline station sites near interstate highways to build restaurants. These early locations all featured gas pumps on-site; during <a href="1973%20oil%20crisis">gasoline shortages</a> in the mid to late 1970s, the firm began to build restaurants without pumps. Into the early 1980s, the company reduced the number of gas stations on-site, eventually phasing them out altogether as the company focused on its restaurant and gift sales revenues. Cracker Barrel became a <a href="Public%20company">publicly traded company</a> in 1981 to raise funds for further expansion. It floated more than half a million shares, raising $4.6 million. Following the initial public offering, Cracker Barrel grew at a rate of around 20 percent per year; by 1987, the company had become a chain of more than 50 units in eight states, with annual net sales of almost $81 million.

The company grew consistently through the 1980s and 1990s, attaining a $1 billion market value by 1992. In 1993, the chain's revenue was nearly twice that of any other family restaurant.

In 1994, the chain tested a <a href="Take-out">carry-out-only</a> store, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Corner Market, in suburban residential neighborhoods. In addition, it expanded into new markets through the establishment of more traditional Cracker Barrel locations, the majority of them outside the South, and tested alterations to its menus to adapt to new regions. The chain added regional dishes to its menus, including eggs and <a href="Salsa%20%28sauce%29">salsa</a> in Texas and <a href="Reuben%20sandwich">Reuben sandwich</a>es in New York, but continued to offer its original menu items in all restaurants.

By September 1997, Cracker Barrel had 314 restaurants, and aimed to increase the number of stores by approximately 50 per year over the following five years. The firm closed its Corner Market operations in 1997 and refocused on its restaurant and gift store locations. Its then president, Ron Magruder, stated that the chain was concentrating on strengthening its core theme, offering traditional foods and retail in a country store setting, with good service and country music. The chain opened its first restaurant and gift store not located near a highway in 1998, in <a href="Dothan%2C%20Alabama">Dothan, Alabama</a>. In the 2000s, in the wake of incidents including charges of racial discrimination and controversy over its policy of firing gay employees, the firm launched a series of promotional activities including a nationwide <a href="Drive%20%28charity%29">book drive</a> and a <a href="sweepstakes">sweepstakes</a> with trips to the <a href="Country%20Music%20Association%20Awards">Country Music Association Awards</a> and rocking chairs among the prizes.

The number of combined restaurants and stores owned by Cracker Barrel increased between 1997 and 2000, to more than 420 locations. In 2000 and 2001, the company addressed staffing and infrastructure issues related to this rapid growth by implementing a more rigorous recruitment strategy and introducing new technology, including an <a href="Restaurant%20POS">order-placement system</a>. From the late 1990s to the mid-2000s, the company focused on opening new locations in residential areas to attract local residents and workers as customers. It updated its marketing in 2006 to encourage new customers, changing the design of its highway <a href="billboard">billboard advertisements</a> to include images of menu items. Previously the signs had featured only the company's logo. By 2011, Cracker Barrel had opened more than 600 restaurants in 42 states. On January 17, 2012, company founder <a href="Dan%20Evins">Dan Evins</a> died of <a href="bladder%20cancer">bladder cancer</a>.

As a <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern-themed</a> chain, Cracker Barrel serves traditional Southern <a href="comfort%20food">comfort food</a> often described as "down-home" country cooking and sells gift items including simple toys representative of the 1950s and 1960s, toy vehicles, puzzles, and woodcrafts. Also sold are country music CDs, DVDs of early classic television, cookbooks, <a href="baking%20mix">baking mix</a>es, kitchen novelty decor, and early classic brands of candy and snack foods. Breakfast is served all day, and there are two menus: one for breakfast, the other for lunch and dinner. Since the first restaurant opened, the menu has featured Southern specialties, including biscuits, fried chicken, and catfish; seasonal and regional menu items were added during the 1980s and 1990s. In 2007, Cracker Barrel announced plans to remove artificial <a href="trans%20fat">trans fat</a>s from its menu items.

For much of its early history, Cracker Barrel decided to locate its restaurants along the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a>, and the majority of its restaurants remain close to interstate and other highways. Cracker Barrel is known for the loyalty of its customers, particularly travelers who are likely to spend more at restaurants than locals.

The locations are themed around the idea of a traditional Southern U.S. <a href="general%20store">general store</a>. Items used to decorate each store are authentic artifacts, including everyday objects from the early 1900s and after. Each restaurant features a front porch lined with wooden rocking chairs, a wooden <a href="peg%20solitaire">peg solitaire</a> game on every table, and a stone fireplace with a deer head displayed above the mantel. In fact, each location has five common items: a shotgun, a cookstove, a deer head, a telephone, and a traffic light. The peg games have been present in Cracker Barrel since the opening of the first store, and continue to be produced by the same family in Lebanon, Tennessee. The decor at each location typically includes artifacts related to the local history of the area, including antique household tools, old wall calendars and advertising posters, and antique photographs; these are centrally stored in a warehouse in Tennessee, where they are cataloged and stockpiled for future use by individual store locations.

"Destinations" magazine has presented the chain with awards for best chain restaurant, and in 2010 and 2011, the <a href="Zagat">Zagat</a> survey named it the "Best Breakfast". The chain was selected by the <a href="Outdoor%20Advertising%20Association%20of%20America">Outdoor Advertising Association of America</a> as the 2011 OBIE Hall of Fame Award recipient for its long-standing use of outdoor advertising. It was also named the "Best Family Dining" restaurant by a nationwide "Choice in Chains" consumer poll in "Restaurants & Institutions" magazine for 19 consecutive years.

Cracker Barrel restaurants are aimed at the family and <a href="casual%20dining">casual dining</a> market as well as retail sales. The chain also advertises to people traveling on the interstate highways, as the majority of its locations are close to highway exits. The company has promoted its <a href="cost%20accounting">cost controls</a> to investors. The company has stated its goal to keep employee turnover low, to provide better trained staff. Since the 1980s, the firm has offered a formal training program with benefits for progressing through it to all of its employees.

The board of directors of Cracker Barrel has repeatedly been at odds with the largest shareholder, <a href="Biglari%20Holdings%20Inc.">Biglari Holdings Inc.</a> The owner of Biglari Holdings, Sardar Biglari, controls a 19.9% share of the company, just short of the 20% needed to trigger a <a href="shareholder%20rights%20plan">shareholder rights plan</a>, more commonly termed a "poison pill". The poison pill was adopted after Biglari Holdings sought approval to purchase a 49.99% share of the company and join the board of directors.

Biglari Holdings purchased shares of Cracker Barrel in 2011, and has often been critical of the transparency to shareholders, overspending on advertising, lack of customer value, capital funds mismanagement, and not maximizing shareholder value. Biglari has requested to be on the board of directors three times, and has been denied each time by a vote of shareholders. Biglari Holdings has also put forward a request for a one-time $20/share <a href="dividend">dividend</a> to address perceived overly conservative capitalization, which was also rejected by shareholders. Cracker Barrel has responded by claiming Biglari has a "hidden agenda" and a conflict of interest by holding shares in other restaurant chains such as <a href="Steak%20%27n%20Shake">Steak 'n Shake</a>.

Cracker Barrel has supported a wide range of charities through one-off donations, promotional events, and partnerships with charitable organizations. The chain has supported charities and causes in communities where its restaurants are located, including the <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">Gulf Coast</a> after <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> in 2005 and Nashville after severe flooding in 2010. In the same year, Cracker Barrel established Cracker Barrel Cares Inc., an employee-funded non-profit organization that provides support to Cracker Barrel employees. Cracker Barrel has also formed a partnership with the <a href="Wounded%20Warrior%20Project">Wounded Warrior Project</a>, a charity for injured veterans. In attempts to rebuild its image after several <a href="Race%20in%20the%20United%20States">race</a>-related controversies, the firm has provided a scholarship through the <a href="National%20Black%20MBA%20Association">National Black MBA Association</a>, and job skills programs and sponsorships with <a href="100%20Black%20Men%20of%20America">100 Black Men of America</a> and the Restaurant and Lodging Association.

Cracker Barrel sponsored the <a href="NASCAR">NASCAR</a> <a href="Atlanta%20500">Atlanta 500</a> race at <a href="Atlanta%20Motor%20Speedway">Atlanta Motor Speedway</a> from 1999 to 2001 and the <a href="Grand%20Ole%20Opry">Grand Ole Opry</a> from 2004 to 2009. The company was the first presenting sponsor of the Grand Ole Opry. This sponsorship allowed the company to make connections within the <a href="Nashville">Nashville</a> music industry, following which it entered into partnership with a number of country music performers. The chain has established partnerships with artists including <a href="Alison%20Krauss">Alison Krauss</a>, <a href="Charlie%20Daniels">Charlie Daniels</a>, <a href="Josh%20Turner">Josh Turner</a>, <a href="Kenny%20Rogers">Kenny Rogers</a>, <a href="Dolly%20Parton">Dolly Parton</a>, <a href="Alan%20Jackson">Alan Jackson</a>, and <a href="Alabama%20%28American%20band%29">Alabama</a>, to offer CD releases and merchandise.

In 1997, the company purchased the <a href="Mitchell%20House%20%28Lebanon%2C%20Tennessee%29">Mitchell House</a> in Lebanon, Tennessee. The house had been the elementary dormitory and school for <a href="Castle%20Heights%20Military%20Academy">Castle Heights Military Academy</a> which both Dan Evans and his son attended. The school had closed in 1986 and the building had sat empty since then. Cracker Barrel spent two million dollars to restore the home and used it as its corporate headquarters from 1999 to 2013.

In early 1991, an intra-company memo called for employees to be dismissed if they did not display "normal heterosexual values". According to news reports, at least 11 employees were fired under the policy on a store-by-store basis from locations in Georgia and other states. After demonstrations by <a href="LGBT%20rights%20in%20the%20United%20States">gay rights</a> groups, the company ended its policy in March 1991 and stated it would not discriminate based on sexual orientation. The company's founder, Dan Evins, subsequently described the policy as a mistake. From 1992 onward, the <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> <a href="pension%20fund">Employees Retirement System</a>, then a major shareholder, put forward proposals to add <a href="sexual%20orientation">sexual orientation</a> to the company's non-discrimination policy. An early proposal in 1993 was defeated, with 77 percent against and only 14 percent in support, along with 9 percent abstaining. It was not until 2002 that the proposals were successful; 58 percent of company shareholders voted in favor of the addition.

Cracker Barrel achieved the lowest score (15 out of 100) of all rated food and beverage companies in the <a href="Human%20Rights%20Campaign">Human Rights Campaign</a>'s 2008 <a href="Corporate%20Equality%20Index">Corporate Equality Index</a>, a measure of LGBT workplace equality. Their score for 2011 had increased to a 55. The 2011 survey noted that the firm had established a non-discrimination policy and had introduced diversity training that included training related to sexual orientation. However, the company's score for 2013 dropped to a 35 out of 100, not having obtained the points related to non-discrimination toward gender identity and health benefits for partners of LGBT employees and transgender-inclusive benefits.

On December 20, 2013, Cracker Barrel announced it would no longer sell certain "<a href="Duck%20Dynasty">Duck Dynasty</a>" products which it was "concerned might offend some of [its] guests" after <a href="Phil%20Robertson">Phil Robertson</a>, a star of the reality TV show, remarked in a "<a href="GQ">GQ</a>" interview
Robertson also made "comments likening homosexuality to terrorism and bestiality" in the interview, and expressed views about <a href="Race%20%28human%20classification%29">race</a> which attracted criticism. On December 22, less than two days after pulling the products from its shelves, Cracker Barrel reversed its position after protests from customers.

In July 1999, a discrimination lawsuit was filed against Cracker Barrel by a group of former employees, who claimed that the company had discriminated against them on the grounds of race. In December 2001, twenty-one of the restaurant's customers, represented by the same attorneys, filed a separate lawsuit, alleging racial discrimination in its treatment of guests. Regarding both accusations, Cracker Barrel officials disputed the claims and stated that the company was committed to fair treatment of its employees and customers.

In 2004, an investigation by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">U.S. Justice Department</a> found evidence that Cracker Barrel had been <a href="Racial%20segregation">segregating</a> customer seating by race; seating or serving white customers before seating or serving black customers; providing inferior service to black customers, and allowing white servers to refuse to serve black customers. The Justice Department determined that the firm had violated <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964%23Title%20II">Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>. The company was required to sign a five-year agreement to introduce "effective nondiscrimination policies and procedures." The terms included new equal opportunity training; the creation of a new system to log, investigate, and resolve complaints of discrimination; and the publicizing of its non-discrimination policies. They were required to hire an outside <a href="auditor">auditor</a> to ensure compliance with the terms of the settlement.

In 2006, Cracker Barrel paid a $2 million settlement to end a <a href="lawsuit">lawsuit</a> alleging race and <a href="sexual%20harassment">sexual harassment</a> at three <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> restaurants. Cracker Barrel stores subsequently began displaying a sign in the front foyer explaining the company's non-discrimination policy, and added to its website and menu the policy and details on how to make a complaint.

Since the early 2000s, Cracker Barrel has provided training and resources to minority employees, to improve its image on diversity. These efforts involved outreach to minority employees, along with testing a training plan to help employees whose first language is Spanish to learn English. , <a href="Racial%20minority">minorities</a> made up 23 percent of the company's employees, including over 11 percent of its management and executives.

Cracker Barrel is on the Corporate Advisory Board for the Texas Conference of the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP), and is a corporate sponsor of the NAACP Leadership 500 Summit. The company has been praised for its gender diversity, particularly on its <a href="board%20of%20directors">board of directors</a>, which includes three women out of eleven total board members. Its <a href="chief%20executive%20officer">chief executive officer</a> (CEO), Sandra Cochran, is the second woman in <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> to hold that office in a publicly traded company.

In November 2012, Cracker Barrel licensed its name to <a href="Smithfield%20Foods">Smithfield Foods</a>' John Morrell Division in a deal to create a line of meat products to be sold in supermarkets and through other retail channels. In response, <a href="Kraft%20Foods">Kraft Foods</a> filed a trademark-infringement lawsuit in February 2013. Kraft has sold cheese in retail stores under their "Cracker Barrel" <a href="brand">brand</a> since 1954. The corporation said that Cracker Barrel stores have not made significant sales of retail food products beyond their restaurant menu, and asked that the Smithfield Foods deal be nullified by the <a href="U.S.%20District%20Court">U.S. District Court</a> in the Northern District of Illinois.

On November 14, 2013, in a unanimous ruling authored by Judge <a href="Richard%20Posner">Richard Posner</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Seventh%20Circuit">Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals</a> upheld a ruling by a lower District Court judge granting an injunction against the sale of Cracker Barrel's meat products to be sold in stores. The Seventh Circuit upheld the injunction based on the combined similarity of the parties’ marks, goods, and channels of trade:  “It’s not the fact that the parties’ trade are so similar that is decisive, nor even the fact that the products are similar (low-cost packaged food items).  It is those similarities coupled with the fact that, if [Cracker Barrel] prevails in this suit, similar products with confusingly similar trade names will be sold through the same distribution channel – grocery stores, and often the same grocery stores – and advertised together.”  In Judge Posner’s estimation, these similarities – despite the differences in the parties’ respective logos and regardless of where the products are located in relation to each other in grocery stores –  might lead consumers to “think all the Kraft products bearing the 'Cracker Barrel' name were produced in association with the Defendant.” In economics this behavior is referred to as 'traditional forward confusion.'  The court further concluded the likelihood of confusion was exacerbated by the fact that both products at issue were inexpensive; thus, consumers were unlikely to scrutinize their respective labels. In response to the ruling, Kraft Foods and Cracker Barrel made an agreement regarding the use of the Cracker Barrel name. In exchange for Kraft dropping the trademark-infringement lawsuit, Cracker Barrel agreed to sell its products under the brand name "CB Old Country Store."

It Is the Law

It Is the Law is a 1924 American <a href="silent%20film">silent</a> <a href="mystery%20film">mystery film</a> directed by <a href="J.%20Gordon%20Edwards">J. Gordon Edwards</a> and starring <a href="Arthur%20Hohl">Arthur Hohl</a>, <a href="Herbert%20Heyes">Herbert Heyes</a>, and <a href="Mona%20Palma">Mona Palma</a>. It is a film adaptation of the 1922 <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> play of the same name by <a href="Elmer%20Rice">Elmer Rice</a>, itself based on a novel by <a href="Hayden%20Talbot">Hayden Talbot</a>. The film depicts the story of Ruth Allen (Palma), who marries Justin Victor (Heyes) over competing suitor Albert Woodruff (Hohl). Seeking revenge for this slight, Woodruff fakes his death by killing a drifter who resembles him, and frames Victor for the murder. Woodruff attempts to renew his courtship of Allen by using an assumed identity, but she sees through his disguise. Once Victor is freed from prison, he kills Woodruff, and goes free because a conviction would constitute <a href="double%20jeopardy">double jeopardy</a>.

This was the final film for director Edwards, who died the following year, and was one of the last produced at <a href="Fox%20Film">Fox Film</a>'s New York studio. Contemporary reviews were generally positive. Like many of Fox's early works, it was likely <a href="lost%20film">lost</a> in the <a href="1937%20Fox%20vault%20fire">1937 Fox vault fire</a>.

Albert Woodruff and Justin Victor are friends who are both in love with the same woman, Ruth Allen. Allen chooses to wed Victor, and Woodruff storms off in a jealous rage. Woodruff locates his <a href="look-alike">look-alike</a>, "Sniffer" Evans, a drifter and drug addict. On the evening following Allen and Victor's wedding, Woodruff calls Allen and threatens to blackmail her. He also convinces Evans to come to his apartment.

Victor also travels to Woodruff's apartment, intending to confront his former friend about the threatening phone call. When Woodruff sees Victor outside the apartment building, he feigns a cry for help and shoots Evans to death. Victor is blamed for the murder of the man presumed to be Woodruff, and is sentenced to <a href="life%20imprisonment">life imprisonment</a>.

Five years later, Woodruff disguises himself with a beard and monocle and assumes a new identity in an attempt to court Allen. She is able to recognize him as Woodruff because of his fear of <a href="fire%20tongs">fire tongs</a>. Because she is friends with the governor, she is able to arrange her husband's release from prison. Victor locates Woodruff in a casino and kills him. At trial, he declares that the prohibition against <a href="double%20jeopardy">double jeopardy</a> prevents his prosecution for the murder; he is set free to live happily with his wife.

Arthur Hohl reprised the role of Woodruff from an earlier production of the story as a Broadway play; in addition to Woodruff and Evans, he played a third role as the casino's proprietor. The cast also includes Dorothy Kingdon, <a href="Helena%20D%27Algy">Helena D'Algy</a>, Patricia O'Connor, and Nancy Newman as casino regulars. This was Herbert Heyes's final silent film; he returned to acting in the 1940s.

In 1922, <a href="theatrical%20agent">theatrical agent</a> Walter Jordan encouraged successful playwright <a href="Elmer%20Rice">Elmer Rice</a> to <a href="Theatrical%20adaptation">dramatize</a> "It Is the Law", an unpublished novel written by <a href="Hayden%20Talbot">Hayden Talbot</a>. At the time, Rice was best known for his 1914 <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> play "On Trial", which featured the first use of <a href="flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashback</a>, a narrative technique he adapted from film, in a Broadway production. Rice's stage adaptation of Talbot's work, also titled "It Is the Law", again featured a story told in flashback. The play ran for 125 performances at the <a href="Walter%20Kerr%20Theatre">Ritz Theatre</a>, and was a modest success.

<a href="Fox%20Film">Fox Film</a> announced production of a film adaptation of "It Is the Law" early in 1924, with <a href="J.%20Gordon%20Edwards">J. Gordon Edwards</a> set to direct. This was the only film he directed that year, as he was primarily serving as Fox Film's director-general at the time. Curtis Benton wrote the screenplay for Fox; unlike the theatrical version, Benton's work presents the story entirely in chronological order. Principal casting was completed in February, and filming took place at Fox's New York studio. Most of Fox's film production had by then moved to <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>: "It Is the Law" was one of only four films Fox made at its East Coast facility in 1924. Except for four <a href="Allan%20Dwan">Allan Dwan</a> films in 1926, they were the last Fox produced in New York. The set constructed for the courtroom climax was a duplicate of a room in <a href="The%20Tombs">The Tombs</a>.

The <a href="copyright%20registration">copyright registration</a> for "It Is the Law" stated its length as eight reels, but the released version was a shorter, seven-reel film. When <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">Twentieth Century-Fox Film</a> <a href="copyright%20renewal">renewed</a> the copyright in 1951, they again referred to the longer run time; the title was also restyled with an exclamation point, as "It Is the Law!" Fox's advertising for the film included a <a href="trailer%20%28promotion%29">trailer</a>, as well as <a href="novelty%20item">novelty item</a>s to be given away by exhibitors, such as a small key described as the "key to the mystery" of the film.

This was Edwards's final work. He retired from Fox after the film's completion, and although he expressed an interest to returning to the role, he died of pneumonia the following year.

"It Is the Law" received generally positive reviews. George T. Pardy, writing for "Exhibitors Trade Review", noted that the audience was aware of the nature of the mystery while the characters were not, a welcome departure from the conventions of most <a href="melodramas">melodramas</a>. "<a href="Motion%20Picture%20Magazine">Motion Picture Magazine</a>" called the film "tense, suspensive, ... and new in its idea." "The Film Daily" reviewer believed it would appeal to fans of the genre despite "some hokum and implausible twists". Edwards's direction was praised, including his pacing of the story, although the reviewer for "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" felt the film was unnecessarily long. Hohl, in his <a href="dual%20role">dual role</a> performance, was considered the strongest of the cast, despite some exaggerated expressions. Chicago-based "Screen Opinions" had a more mixed opinion, giving the film a 65% score; despite praising the direction and cast, its reviewer felt the film was "too unhappy to be popular".

"It Is the Law" is believed to be <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>. The <a href="1937%20Fox%20vault%20fire">1937 Fox vault fire</a> destroyed most of Fox's silent films, and the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> is not aware of any extant copies. Because little of Edwards's work survives, few of his films have drawn attention from modern authors, but film historian Larry Langman included "It Is the Law" as an example of how avenging-spouse films evolved in the 1920s to "emphasize the inner strengths of their women".

History of York City F.C. (1980–present)

<a href="York%20City%20F.C.">York City Football Club</a> is a professional <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club based in <a href="York">York</a>, North Yorkshire, England. Its history from the <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20Football%20League">1980–81</a> to the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20National%20League%23National%20League%20North">current season</a> saw fluctuating fortunes in the 1980s and 1990s, and <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegations</a> from <a href="English%20Football%20League">the Football League</a>.

York made their seventh <a href="Re-election%20%28Football%20League%29">re-election</a> bid after 1980–81, before the club won its first and only league title after finishing first in the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> in <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">1983–84</a> with 101 points. They were the first team to score this many points in a Football League season. After four seasons in the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a>, York were relegated in <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Football%20League">1987–88</a>, statistically the club's worst Football League season. They beat <a href="Crewe%20Alexandra%20F.C.">Crewe Alexandra</a> on <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalties</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> in the <a href="1993%20Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20play-off%20Final">play-off final</a> in <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">1992–93</a>, winning promotion back to the third tier of English football, now renamed as the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>. The <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Football%20League">following season</a>, York competed in the <a href="EFL%20League%20Two%20play-offs">play-off</a> semi-final, when they were beaten by <a href="Stockport%20County%20F.C.">Stockport County</a>. Later in the 1990s, they knocked <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> teams <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> and <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> out of the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> in successive seasons. After six seasons, York were relegated to the Third Division in <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Football%20League">1998–99</a>. In the following years, the club experienced financial troubles; chairman <a href="Douglas%20Craig">Douglas Craig</a> offered the club and its ground for sale in December 2001.

The club was bought by <a href="John%20Batchelor%20%28racing%29">John Batchelor</a> in March 2002, but the following December they went into <a href="Administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a>. In March 2003, York were taken over by the Supporters' Trust, and were relegated to the <a href="National%20League%20%28division%29">Conference National</a> in <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Football%20League">2003–04</a>, ending 75 years of Football League membership. The team were unsuccessful in the play-offs in the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">2006–07</a> and <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">2009–10 seasons</a>, and were beaten at the newly rebuilt <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> in the <a href="2009%20FA%20Trophy%20Final">2009 FA Trophy Final</a>. In <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">2011–12</a>, York defeated <a href="Newport%20County%20A.F.C.">Newport County</a> at Wembley Stadium in the <a href="2012%20FA%20Trophy%20Final">2012 FA Trophy Final</a>, and shortly after returned to the Football League with a 2–1 win over <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a> in the <a href="2012%20Conference%20Premier%20play-off%20Final">play-off final</a>. In their <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">second season</a> in <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">League Two</a>, the club reached the play-offs but were knocked out in the semi-final by <a href="Fleetwood%20Town%20F.C.">Fleetwood Town</a>. After four years back in the Football League, York were relegated to the <a href="National%20League%20%28division%29">National League</a> in <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">2015–16</a>. They were relegated to the <a href="National%20League%20North">National League North</a> the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20National%20League%23National%20League">following season</a>, but won the FA Trophy after beating <a href="Macclesfield%20Town%20F.C.">Macclesfield Town</a> in the <a href="2017%20FA%20Trophy%20Final">2017 final</a>.

The <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20Football%20League">1980–81 season</a> started comfortably for <a href="York%20City%20F.C.">York City</a>, and the team were 14th in the table by mid January 1981. However, three wins from the last 18 matches saw them finish in bottom place. York's seventh application for <a href="Re-election%20%28Football%20League%29">re-election</a> was successful with 46 votes. Poor form at home contributed to York occupying the bottom half of the table for most of <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20Football%20League">1981–82</a>, with a <a href="List%20of%20York%20City%20F.C.%20records%20and%20statistics">club record</a> of 12 successive home matches without a win set. <a href="Barry%20Lyons%20%28footballer%29">Barry Lyons</a> was dismissed as <a href="List%20of%20York%20City%20F.C.%20managers">manager</a> in December 1981, and the club dropped into the bottom four under the <a href="caretaker%20manager">caretaker management</a> of <a href="Kevin%20Randall">Kevin Randall</a>. Former York player and club director <a href="Barry%20Swallow">Barry Swallow</a> took over as caretaker manager in March 1982, and several convincing home wins toward the end of the season helped the team to 17th place. <a href="Denis%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201947%29">Denis Smith</a>, who had played on <a href="Loan%20%28sports%29">loan</a> from <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a> the previous season, was appointed <a href="player-manager">player-manager</a> in May 1982, with <a href="Viv%20Busby">Viv Busby</a> as his assistant player-coach. York finished <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Football%20League">1982–83</a> in seventh place; their inconsistent away form in the last half of the season led to them missing out on <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a>. The club occupied one of the top two places in <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">1983–84</a> from the second week of the season onwards, and won the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> championship with 101 points. They became the first team to achieve a three-figure points total in a <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> season. The "<a href="The%20Press%20%28York%29">Yorkshire Evening Press</a>" billed them the "Team of the Century". York set new club records for most wins (31), most away wins (13) and most goals (91). For the first time since <a href="1954%E2%80%9355%20Football%20League">1954–55</a>, York had two players score over 20 league goals in a season; these were <a href="John%20Byrne%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201961%29">John Byrne</a> and <a href="Keith%20Walwyn">Keith Walwyn</a>. A profit of almost £15,000 was posted and the club aspired to further progress and promotion.

Winning six of their first eight matches in <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Football%20League">1984–85</a>, York were top of the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> by early October 1984. After a run of two wins from 11 matches, they slipped to 11th place in mid December 1984, though they continued to occupy a top half position before finishing the season in eighth place. In January 1985, York beat <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> team <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> 1–0 at home in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> fourth round, courtesy of a late <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty</a> scored by <a href="Keith%20Houchen">Keith Houchen</a>. They reached the fifth round for the third time and drew 1–1 at home to <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a> holders <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>. They lost 7–0 in the replay at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a>—the club's record cup defeat. York started <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Football%20League">1985–86</a> well and were second in the table by late November 1985, before a poor midseason spell saw them drop into midtable. After being unbeaten in the last nine matches, they finished seventh in the table, marking the fifth consecutive season in which York's end-of-season league placing improved. They reached the FA Cup fifth round for the second consecutive season, again drawing 1–1 at home to Liverpool, before losing 3–1 after <a href="extra%20time">extra time</a> at Anfield. York made a strong start to <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Football%20League">1986–87</a>, and in late September 1986 they were in second place. They won only seven of their remaining 38 matches and needed a point from their last match to avoid the danger of relegation, which they achieved with a 1–1 draw against <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a>. York finished 1986–87 in 20th place.

Smith left to take over at <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> in May 1987, and former <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> manager <a href="Bobby%20Saxton">Bobby Saxton</a> was appointed in June. Only two players were under contract at the time of Saxton's arrival; his hastily arranged squad struggled from the start of <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Football%20League">1987–88</a>, and only won their first match in late October 1987. York were bottom of the table for most of the season, and were relegated after finishing in 23rd place. The season was statistically the club's worst in the Football League, with the fewest wins (eight), most defeats (29) and the fewest points since the <a href="three%20points%20for%20a%20win">three points for a win</a> system was introduced (33). York made a poor start to <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Football%20League">1988–89</a>, and Saxton resigned with the club bottom of the Fourth Division in mid September 1988. Swallow took over on a caretaker basis before the former <a href="Hartlepool%20United%20F.C.">Hartlepool United</a> manager <a href="John%20Bird%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201948%29">John Bird</a> was appointed in October 1988. York's away form improved in the second half of the season, and in the last week they had a slim chance of reaching the <a href="EFL%20League%20Two%20play-offs">play-offs</a>. They missed out on a play-off place and finished the season in 11th place. A record loss of £190,000 was posted for the season, but the club carried no overdraft because of interest-free loans from directors and a £100,000 share issue. York started <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20Football%20League">1989–90</a> strongly and were in third place by mid December 1989. Successive home defeats in late December 1989 marked the start of a decline that saw them finish the season 13th in the table.

In September 1990, York player <a href="David%20Longhurst">David Longhurst</a> collapsed and died after suffering heart failure during a home match against <a href="Lincoln%20City%20F.C.">Lincoln City</a>. A few months later, a newly built, covered stand at the Shipton Street End of <a href="Bootham%20Crescent">Bootham Crescent</a> was named after him. York were the Fourth Division's second lowest scorers in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Football%20League">1990–91</a>, as they finished 21st in the table. <a href="Douglas%20Craig">Douglas Craig</a>, who had been on the board since 1978, succeeded Michael Sinclair as chairman in June 1991. York had won two of 11 matches by mid October 1991; Bird was dismissed and was replaced in November by <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> assistant manager <a href="John%20Ward%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201951%29">John Ward</a>. York continued to be placed in lower midtable, and finished fourth from bottom for the second year running in <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Football%20League">1991–92</a>. They started <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">1992–93</a> with a club-record start of four wins, and led the table until late December 1992. Ward left for <a href="Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.">Bristol Rovers</a> in March 1993, shortly after a midseason slump in which York won only one of 13 matches. Ward's assistant <a href="Alan%20Little%20%28footballer%29">Alan Little</a> took over and York finished the season in fourth place. They played <a href="Bury%20F.C.">Bury</a> in the play-off semi-final, drawing the first leg 0–0 at <a href="Gigg%20Lane">Gigg Lane</a> before winning the second leg 1–0 at home with a goal from <a href="Gary%20Swann">Gary Swann</a>. In the <a href="1993%20Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20play-off%20Final">final</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>, York beat <a href="Crewe%20Alexandra%20F.C.">Crewe Alexandra</a> 5–3 on <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalties</a>, after the score had finished 1–1 after extra time. <a href="Wayne%20Hall%20%28footballer%29">Wayne Hall</a> scored the decisive penalty as York won promotion to the third tier, now named the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> after the formation of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in 1992.

York made a good start to <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Football%20League">1993–94</a>, before a series of poor results saw them slip to 17th place in late November 1993. They only lost five of their last 30 fixtures to finish the season fifth in the Second Division table—their highest league placing since 1976. They lost to <a href="Stockport%20County%20F.C.">Stockport County</a> in the <a href="EFL%20League%20One%20play-offs">play-off</a> semi-final, being beaten 1–0 in the second leg at <a href="Edgeley%20Park">Edgeley Park</a> after drawing 0–0 at home in the first leg. York were in lower midtable for the first half of <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Football%20League">1994–95</a>, but improving form saw them move up the table, before finishing in ninth place. They struggled through most of <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Football%20League">1995–96</a>, and only avoided relegation by winning their last match away to <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton & Hove Albion</a>; they finished in 20th place. This season saw York record a 4–3 aggregate victory over <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> in the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> second round. York defeated a strong United team including some younger players 3–0 at <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a> in the first leg; in the second leg, United fielded some more experienced players, and despite losing 3–1, York progressed on aggregate. United went on to win the Premier League and FA Cup double. York finished 20th in <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">1996–97</a>, only securing safety in the penultimate match with an away win over <a href="Rotherham%20United%20F.C.">Rotherham United</a>. For the second consecutive season, they eliminated Premier League opponents from the League Cup in the second round, with a 4–3 aggregate win over <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>. After drawing the first leg 1–1 at <a href="Goodison%20Park">Goodison Park</a>, York progressed after winning the second leg 3–2 at home. In mid December 1997, York were fourth in the table, but declining form after New Year saw them finish <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">1997–98</a> in 16th place.

By mid October 1998, York were placed eighth in the Second Division. They slipped to the bottom third of the table after winning one point from a possible 21. Despite improved results over Christmas, York played 11 consecutive matches without a win. In mid March 1999, the club was just above the bottom four places, when Little was dismissed and player-coach <a href="Neil%20Thompson">Neil Thompson</a> appointed caretaker manager. A flurry of transfers, including the departure of leading scorer <a href="Richard%20Cresswell">Richard Cresswell</a> to Premier League club <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a> for a club-record fee of £950,000, followed. After losing away to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> on the last day of <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Football%20League">1998–99</a>, York dropped into the bottom four for the first time that season, and were relegated in 21st place. The club's trading loss for the season was £483,096, despite a record profit of £1,274,202 from lucrative transfers. Club historian David Batters said, "the stark reality was that the club had to sell to survive". In July 1999, the club and its <a href="real%20property">real property</a> assets, including the ground, were transferred to a <a href="holding%20company">holding company</a> called Bootham Crescent Holdings (BCH) for £165,000. Thompson was dismissed in February 2000 after a run of one win from 12 matches during the middle of <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Football%20League">1999–2000</a>. Former <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a> manager <a href="Terry%20Dolan%20%28footballer%29">Terry Dolan</a> took over, and York finished the season in 20th place after conceding only five goals in the last 12 matches. Losses for the season were £667,255, and the wage bill of £1,635,736 was twice that of 1995.

By mid February 2001, York were bottom of the Third Division table, but after losing only two of their last 16 matches they finished <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Football%20League">2000–01</a> in 17th. They reached the FA Cup third round for the second time since 1986, but were beaten 3–0 by Premier League team <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> at <a href="Filbert%20Street">Filbert Street</a>. Record losses of £1,261,038 were reported in November 2001, before Craig announced in December that the club and the ground had been put up for sale for £4.5 million. Craig later said Bootham Crescent would close by June 2002, and the club would resign from the Football League if a buyer was not found. The club was taken over by motor racing driver <a href="John%20Batchelor%20%28racing%29">John Batchelor</a> in March 2002. He pledged to give the Supporters' Trust (ST) two seats on the board and announced a sponsorship deal with <a href="Persimmon%20plc">Persimmon</a> that would see an undisclosed amount split between the club and his racing team. By late March 2002, York were second from bottom, before a run of five wins from the last eight matches saw them finish <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Football%20League">2001–02</a> in 14th place. They reached the FA Cup fourth round for the first time since 1986, losing 2–0 at home to Premier League team <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>.

In May 2002, the club was rebranded York City Soccer Club as part of Batchelor's plan to market it in the United States. Persimmon, which had bought 10% of the shares in BCH, submitted <a href="Planning%20permission">planning applications</a> for 93 homes on the site of Bootham Crescent, and Batchelor spoke of building York a new stadium at Clifton Moor. The club entered a creditors' voluntary agreement in November 2002, and the "York Evening Press" said York had been "plunged into the darkest, coldest days of its history". The club went into <a href="Administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a> in December 2002, and was given five weeks to find a buyer or face <a href="Bankruptcy%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">bankruptcy</a>. The ST donated £92,000 to give the club a temporary reprieve. The ST took control over the club in March 2003 after the <a href="Inland%20Revenue">Inland Revenue</a> accepted an offer of £100,000 as payment for £160,000 owed in tax. <a href="Steve%20Beck%20%28chairman%29">Steve Beck</a> became the new chairman. Batchelor had diverted almost all of the £400,000 Persimmon sponsorship money away from York to his racing team, and his promise of having ST members on the board never materialised. He left the club with a profit of £120,000 and admitted to <a href="asset%20stripping">asset stripping</a> during his time as owner. Despite the off-field problems, York pushed for promotion in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Football%20League">2002–03</a> and were in an automatic promotion place by late March 2003. They won none of their last six matches and finished the season in 10th place.

Dolan was dismissed in May 2003, the new board citing financial reasons for his departure. At 27 years, York player <a href="Chris%20Brass">Chris Brass</a> was appointed player-manager in June 2003, which made him the youngest Football League managerial appointment since 1946. The club's lease of Bootham Crescent was extended to May 2004, and plans proceeded to develop <a href="Huntington%20Stadium">Huntington Stadium</a> ahead of a possible move, but problems bringing the ground to Football League standards were encountered. The board preferred to stay at Bootham Crescent, and they bought the site in February 2004 after six months of negotiations. The deal came after York were lent £2 million by <a href="The%20Football%20Stadia%20Improvement%20Fund">The Football Stadia Improvement Fund</a> (FSIF), with which they bought 75.89% of BCH shares and all of the 20,000 shares owned by Persimmon. Once plans for a new stadium were settled, the loan would be converted a grant to help fund the move. York equalled a club record by winning the first four matches of <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Football%20League">2003–04</a>, and by mid January 2004 were 10th in the table. They won none of their final 20 fixtures, garnering only five more points as they finished bottom of the Third Division. York were relegated to the <a href="National%20League%20%28division%29">Conference National</a> after 75 years of Football League membership. Beck renounced his title of chairman in September 2004 because he favoured a more democratic approach for a <a href="List%20of%20fan-owned%20sports%20teams">fan-owned club</a>. The board was restructured and <a href="Jason%20McGill">Jason McGill</a> became the <a href="Chief%20executive%20officer">managing director</a>.

In November 2004, Brass was dismissed after a home defeat to <a href="Forest%20Green%20Rovers%20F.C.">Forest Green Rovers</a>, which left York fourth from the bottom of the table. His assistant Viv Busby took over as caretaker manager before former <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> coach <a href="Billy%20McEwan%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201951%29">Billy McEwan</a> was appointed in February 2005. Under McEwan, York avoided relegation to the <a href="National%20League%20North">Conference North</a>, with a 17th-place finish in <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Football%20Conference">2004–05</a>. One-third into <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Football%20Conference">2005–06</a>, York were in second place but poor midseason results saw them slide down the table. They pushed for the play-offs after six consecutive wins but finished in eighth place after faltering in the run-in. With 22 goals, <a href="Andy%20Bishop">Andy Bishop</a> was the Conference National top scorer in 2005–06. Financial problems arose again; a loss of £150,000 was reported for the season, and there were problems meeting the first annual payment of £100,000 to the FSIF. McGill's company JM Packaging made a proposal to the ST to become majority shareholders, and would lend the club £650,000 to cover the current losses and meet the loan repayments for the next five years. ST members approved the proposal in June 2006, and JM Packaging became 75% shareholders, reducing the ST's previous 85% ownership to 25%. York made a good start to <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">2006–07</a>, and were never out of the top five from early November 2006. They finished the season in fourth place and played <a href="Morecambe%20F.C.">Morecambe</a> in the play-off semi-final; after drawing 0–0 at home in the first leg, they were beaten 2–1 at <a href="Christie%20Park%20%28Morecambe%29">Christie Park</a> in the second leg.

York started <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">2007–08</a> by losing seven of their first 10 matches. Despite improving form, their home results remained poor, leading to McEwan's dismissal in November 2007. He was succeeded by his assistant <a href="Colin%20Walker%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201958%29">Colin Walker</a>, after the team won five of his six matches as caretaker manager. York finished the season in 14th place, and reached the semi-final of the <a href="FA%20Trophy">FA Trophy</a>, losing 2–1 on aggregate to <a href="Torquay%20United%20F.C.">Torquay United</a>. In May 2008, <a href="City%20of%20York%20Council">City of York Council</a> announced its commitment to build a <a href="York%20Community%20Stadium">community stadium</a>, to be used by York and the city's rugby league club, <a href="York%20City%20Knights">York City Knights</a>. An agreement with the FSIF was reached in September 2008; the club would stop making loan repayments and would repay the outstanding amount once Bootham Crescent was sold. At the start of <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">2008–09</a>, York won only five of their 19 league matches, resulting in Walker's dismissal in November 2008. Under his replacement, former <a href="Port%20Vale%20F.C.">Port Vale</a> manager <a href="Martin%20Foyle">Martin Foyle</a>, the team avoided relegation in the penultimate match of the season against <a href="Weymouth%20F.C.">Weymouth</a>, and they finished 17th in the table. York participated in the <a href="2009%20FA%20Trophy%20Final">2009 FA Trophy Final</a> at the newly rebuilt <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>, where they were beaten 2–0 by <a href="Stevenage%20F.C.">Stevenage Borough</a>. After starting <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">2009–10</a> with only one win from five matches, York won eight successive matches in a bid for promotion. They finished in fifth place and faced <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a> in the play-off semi-final, winning each leg 1–0. However, they were beaten 3–1 by <a href="Oxford%20United%20F.C.">Oxford United</a> at Wembley Stadium in the <a href="2010%20Conference%20Premier%20play-off%20Final">final</a>. They reached the FA Cup third round that season, and were beaten 3–1 by Premier League team Stoke City at the <a href="bet365%20Stadium">Britannia Stadium</a>. <a href="Richard%20Brodie%20%28footballer%29">Richard Brodie</a> was the <a href="National%20League%20%28division%29">Conference Premier</a> joint top scorer in 2009–10, with 26 goals.

After winning only three of their first 10 matches of <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">2010–11</a>, Foyle resigned as manager in September 2010, and was replaced with <a href="Tamworth%20F.C.">Tamworth</a> manager <a href="Gary%20Mills%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201961%29">Gary Mills</a> the following month. Improving form saw York challenge for the play-offs, and by mid March 2011 they were sixth in the table—one place away from a play-off spot. They won only three of 10 matches in the run-in and missed out on the play-offs to finish the season in eighth place. York reached the FA Cup third round for the second consecutive year, and lost 2–0 to Premier League team <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> at the <a href="Macron%20Stadium">Reebok Stadium</a>. York won three of the opening seven matches in <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">2011–12</a> and were only once below a play-off place from early October 2011, finishing the season in fourth place. Playing a passing style of football but producing results when needed, they earned 83 points that season—the second highest in the club's history. York drew 1–1 at home to <a href="Mansfield%20Town%20F.C.">Mansfield Town</a> in the play-off semi-final first leg and won the second leg 1–0 after extra time at <a href="Field%20Mill">Field Mill</a>. They then beat <a href="Newport%20County%20A.F.C.">Newport County</a> 2–0 at Wembley Stadium in the <a href="2012%20FA%20Trophy%20Final">2012 FA Trophy Final</a>, which was the first time the club had won a national knockout competition. A week later, they returned to Wembley Stadium for the <a href="2012%20Conference%20Premier%20play-off%20Final">play-off final</a>, beating Luton Town 2–1, with goals from <a href="Ashley%20Chambers">Ashley Chambers</a> and <a href="Matty%20Blair">Matty Blair</a>. The club was promoted to <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">League Two</a>, returning to the Football League after an eight-year absence. In between the two matches, City of York Council granted planning permission for a new community stadium to be built at Monks Cross.

York started <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">2012–13</a> by winning five of 14 matches, and were ninth in the table by late October 2012. They dropped down the table in the following months, but were still in contention for a play-off place after beating <a href="Burton%20Albion%20F.C.">Burton Albion</a> 3–0 in the New Year. After this match, York failed to win 11 consecutive matches, and Mills was dismissed in March 2013 after a 2–0 home defeat to <a href="Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.">Bradford City</a>. Under his replacement, former <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Northern Ireland</a> manager <a href="Nigel%20Worthington">Nigel Worthington</a>, York avoided relegation by winning four of their last five matches. They finished their first League Two season in 17th place. York won only four of their first 23 matches of <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">2013–14</a>, and were third from the bottom of the table by late December 2013. A number of influential signings in January 2014 helped York improve their form, and from early February they were unbeaten in 17 consecutive matches, conceding no goals from open play. York finished in seventh place and played <a href="Fleetwood%20Town%20F.C.">Fleetwood Town</a> in the play-off semi-final. After losing the first leg 1–0 at home, York drew 0–0 at <a href="Highbury%20Stadium%20%28Fleetwood%29">Highbury Stadium</a> in the second leg. Worthington resigned as manager in October 2014 after York won only one of their opening 14 matches of <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">2014–15</a>. He was succeeded by former <a href="Scunthorpe%20United%20F.C.">Scunthorpe United</a> manager <a href="Russ%20Wilcox">Russ Wilcox</a>. York remained in the lower reaches of the table. They avoided relegation with a late-season run of four wins from five matches, finishing the season in 18th place.

With York 21st in the table after a nine-match run without a league win, Wilcox was dismissed in October 2015. He was succeeded in November 2015 by the former <a href="Dundee%20United%20F.C.">Dundee United</a> manager <a href="Jackie%20McNamara">Jackie McNamara</a>. York won only another five matches in <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20York%20City%20F.C.%20season">2015–16</a>, and were relegated to the <a href="National%20League%20%28division%29">National League</a> in bottom place. This heralded the end of a four-year return in the Football League, and Dave Flett of "The Press" argued that McNamara would "always be held most accountable for the second-worst campaign, points wise, in the club's 94-year history". In October 2016, Gary Mills returned as manager, shortly after his dismissal by Wrexham. York were 19th in the table, after starting <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20National%20League%23National%20League">2016–17</a> with only three wins from 15 matches. They spent much of the coming months in the relegation zone, before Mills' rebuilt squad went on a run of six wins from nine matches to be above the relegation zone with three fixtures remaining. However, York were relegated to the <a href="National%20League%20North">National League North</a> for the first time on the last day of the season, after a 2–2 home draw with Forest Green Rovers. They finished in 21st place, one point from safety. However, York won the FA Trophy for the second time in 2016–17, beating <a href="Macclesfield%20Town%20F.C.">Macclesfield Town</a> 3–2 at Wembley Stadium in the <a href="2017%20FA%20Trophy%20Final">2017 final</a>.

Following a defeat to <a href="South%20Shields%20F.C.">South Shields</a> in the FA Cup third qualifying round, Mills was dismissed as York's manager. They were seventh in the National League North, 11 points from the only automatic promotion place. His replacement was <a href="Martin%20Gray%20%28footballer%29">Martin Gray</a>, transferring from York's divisional rivals <a href="Darlington%20F.C.">Darlington</a>.

Persoonia terminalis

Persoonia terminalis, also known as the Torrington geebung, is a rare <a href="shrub">shrub</a> belonging to the family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>, and native to northern <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and southern <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> in eastern Australia. Reported as a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of "<a href="Persoonia%20nutans">Persoonia nutans</a>" in 1981, it was <a href="Species%20description">described</a> as a species by <a href="Lawrence%20Alexander%20Sidney%20Johnson">Lawrie Johnson</a> and his colleague Peter Weston in 1991.

Two subspecies"P.t.terminalis" and "P.t.recurva"are recognised; both are found on well-drained <a href="soil%20pH">acidic</a> soils in <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forests, and "P.t.terminalis" is also found on granite <a href="outcrop">outcrop</a>s. Although similar in appearance, they differ in leaf length and curvature. Both have a restricted range, with "P.t.terminalis" found in an area of under .

"P.terminalis" grows to , with an upright or spreading <a href="Habit%20%28biology%29">habit</a>, and narrow short leaves up to in length. The yellow flowers mainly appear in December and January (Australia's <a href="Temperate%20climate">temperate zone</a> summer), and are followed by purple-striped green <a href="drupe">drupe</a>s (stone fruit). The fruit of persoonias are edible, and dispersed by wild <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s.

"Persoonia terminalis" was first reported by <a href="Lawrence%20Alexander%20Sidney%20Johnson">Lawrie Johnson</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Sydney">Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney</a>, in the 1981 edition of "Flora of New South Wales". He viewed it as a distinctive subspecies of "<a href="Persoonia%20nutans">Persoonia nutans</a>", a broadly defined species that included many forms since classified as distinct. Queensland botanists Trevor Donald Stanley and Estelle M. Ross classed "P.terminalis" as part of "<a href="Persoonia%20oxycoccoides">Persoonia oxycoccoides</a>" in their 1983 work "Flora of South-eastern Queensland". They considered it more likely a species in its own right, as they believed the description of the Queensland populations did not match the "P. oxycoccoides" from central New South Wales. Upon re-examining "Persoonia nutans" and "Persoonia oxycoccoides", Johnson and Peter Weston concluded that there were in fact several distinct species, and that "Persoonia terminalis" was <a href="Species%20description">described</a> as such in 1991. The <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type</a> specimen was collected south of the <a href="Torrington%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Torrington</a> pub on the Emmaville–Torrington road by Weston and ecologist Peter Richards, and is now housed in the National Herbarium of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, which is part of the Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust Sydney and Office of Environment and Heritage. The Herbarium houses over 1.2million other specimens. The <a href="generic%20name%20%28biology%29">generic</a> name "<a href="Persoonia">Persoonia</a>" is derived from the name of South African botanist <a href="Christiaan%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christiaan Hendrik Persoon</a>. The specific name "terminalis" refers to the <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s (clusters of flowers) that are in this species at the ends of the branchlets. Its common name is the Torrington geebung.

It is classified within the genus as within the "Lanceolata" group, which consists of 58 closely related species with similar flowers but very different foliage. These species will often <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">interbreed</a> with each other in areas where two members of the group occur. "P.terminalis" has been reported to interbreed with "<a href="Persoonia%20cornifolia">Persoonia cornifolia</a>" and "<a href="Persoonia%20sericea">Persoonia sericea</a>", two other members of the group.

Two subspecies are recognised: "P.t."subsp."recurva" has shorter leaves, with margins more curved downwards, that reach a maximum of in length, while "P.t."subsp."terminalis" has longer, straighter leaves measuring a maximum of long.

"Persoonia terminalis" grows as a shrub reaching a height of , with an upright or spreading <a href="Habit%20%28biology%29">habit</a>. It has smooth bark, although new growth is covered in fine hair. The small, narrow leaves are wide and long, with a convex upper surface and margins curved downwards. New leaves can be hairless or slightly hairy; if the latter, they lose the hair with age. They are <a href="wikt%3Aconcolorous">concolorous</a>that is, both leaf surfaces are the same colour, or slightly discolorous (surfaces slightly different). The leaves are rougher than those of other persoonias.

The yellow flowers mainly appear in December and January (summer in the <a href="Temperate%20climate">temperate zone</a> of Australia), although occasional flowers have been seen as late as July. They are terminal, that is, arising at the ends of branchlets, where they appear in groups of one to five. "P.terminalis" is described as mostly anauxotelic, which means each stalk bears an individual flower that is <a href="Subtended%20angle">subtended</a> by a <a href="%3Awikt%3Ascale%20leaf">scale leaf</a> at its junction with the stem. A proportion of flowers have a <a href="%3Awikt%3Atrue%20leaf">true leaf</a> at this junction instead, and are described as auxotelic. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical <a href="Catacorolla">perianth</a> that splits into four segments or <a href="tepal">tepal</a>s, and contains both male and female parts. Within this, the central <a href="Style%20%28flower%29">style</a> is surrounded by the <a href="Stamen">anther</a>, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the <a href="Stigma%20%28botany%29">stigma</a>, which is located at the tip of the style. Flowers are followed by the development of the fleshy purple-striped green <a href="drupe">drupe</a>s. These are long by wide, with the remnant style at the end.

"Persooniat."subsp."terminalis" is found in the Torrington-<a href="Binghi%20Plateau">Binghi</a> area on the western parts of the far <a href="Northern%20Tablelands">Northern Tablelands</a> in New South Wales, roughly halfway between <a href="Glen%20Innes%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Glen Innes</a> and the Queensland border, at an altitude of between above sea level. It grows on acidic, sandy or stony <a href="granite">granite</a> soils in dry <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest. The region is dotted with granite <a href="outcrop">outcrop</a>s, where the subspecies is a component of "<a href="Kardomia%20odontocalyx">Babingtonia odontocalyx</a>'<a href="Brachyloma%20saxicola">Brachyloma saxicola</a>" shrubland and "<a href="Prostanthera%20staurophylla">Prostanthera staurophylla</a>'<a href="Kunzea%20bracteolata">Kunzea bracteolata</a>" low shrubland in the Torrington area, and "<a href="Allocasuarina%20brachystachya">Allocasuarina brachystachya</a>" shrubland in the Severn River Reserve. It is rated 2R on the <a href="ROTAP">ROTAP</a> list.

"Persooniat."subsp."recurva" has two <a href="disjunct%20distribution">disjunct</a> populations. One is found on the North Western Slopes in New South Wales, near <a href="Warialda">Warialda</a> north west of <a href="Inverell">Inverell</a>, and the other is southwest of <a href="Inglewood%2C%20Queensland">Inglewood</a> in southeastern Queensland, between above sea level. It grows on acidic <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>-based sandy soils in dry sclerophyll forest. Within the <a href="Warialda%20State%20Conservation%20Area">Warialda State Conservation Area</a>, it is found in black cypress pine ("<a href="Callitris%20endlicheri">Callitris endlicheri</a>")dirty gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20chloroclada">Eucalyptus chloroclada</a>") woodland and smooth-barked apple ("<a href="Angophora%20leiocarpa">Angophora leiocarpa</a>")black cypress pine woodland. Although "P.t.recurva" has not been recorded from <a href="Kings%20Plains%20National%20Park">Kings Plains National Park</a>, it could be expected to be found there due to the availability of suitable habitat. It is rated as 3R on the ROTAP list.

Both subspecies are commonly found near the <a href="Severn%20River%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Severn River Nature Preserve</a>, as well as in the Arakoola Nature Reserve, where they are components of a woodland ecological community dominated by smooth-barked apple and long-fruited bloodwood ("<a href="Corymbia%20dolichocarpa">Corymbia dolichocarpa</a>"), which grows on sandstone soils.

"Persoonia terminalis" grows in a <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfire</a>-prone habitat, where fire is essential for many species to regenerate. "P.t.terminalis" is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed, which lies dormant in the soil. Large numbers of "Persoonia" seedlings appear after fire. However, rocky outcrop habitat is vulnerable to fires occurring at too-frequent intervals of less than five years, which puts many species that regenerate by seed at risk of local extinction as plants are unable to mature to set seed before the next fire.

<a href="Colletidae">Colletid</a> bees of subgenus "Cladocerapis" within the genus "<a href="Leioproctus">Leioproctus</a>" exclusively forage on and <a href="Pollination">pollinate</a> flowers of many species of "Persoonia". Bees of subgenus "Filiglossa" in the same genus also specialise in feeding on "Persoonia" flowers, but do not appear to be effective pollinators. The fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates, such as <a href="kangaroo">kangaroo</a>s and <a href="Phalangeriformes">possums</a>, as well as <a href="currawong">currawong</a>s and other large birds.

Horticulturists and scientists Rodger Elliot and David L. Jones have proposed that <a href="Horticulture">cultivating</a> the plant would aid in its conservation. Cultivating the plant would most likely require good water drainage, a sunny or part-shaded position and <a href="Soil%20pH">acidic soil</a>. "P.terminalis" is <a href="Hardiness%20%28plants%29">hardy</a> to heavy <a href="frost">frost</a>s, and is expected to fare better in a temperate rather than <a href="Subtropics">subtropical</a> garden climate. <a href="plant%20propagation">Propagation</a> would theoretically be by seed or by taking cuttings of new growth, though plants of the genus "<a href="Persoonia">Persoonia</a>" as a genus are generally difficult to propagate by any means in cultivation.

Archie vs. Predator

Archie vs. Predator is a <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a> and <a href="intercompany%20crossover">intercompany crossover</a>, written by <a href="Alex%20de%20Campi">Alex de Campi</a> and drawn by Fernando Ruiz. It was originally published as a four-issue <a href="Limited%20series%20%28comics%29">limited series</a> in the United States by <a href="Dark%20Horse%20Comics">Dark Horse Comics</a> and <a href="Archie%20Comics">Archie Comics</a> in 2015. The single issues were released between April and July, and a hardcover collection went on sale in November 2015.

Following in a long tradition of all-American teenager <a href="Archie%20Andrews">Archie Andrews</a> meeting unusual celebrities and pop culture icons, this comic book shows him meeting the galaxy's deadliest hunter, the <a href="Predator%20%28alien%29">Predator</a>. The idea was first suggested in the Archie office and then proposed to Dark Horse, who holds the license to comics featuring the Predator character owned by <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a>. The companies paired de Campi, a horror writer at Dark Horse, with Ruiz, a regular "Archie" artist. When the comic book was announced, many media outlets noted in their headlines that the new title was not a joke.

In "Archie vs. Predator", a trophy-hunting alien arrives on Earth and begins stalking high school student Archie Andrews and his classmates. After a number of teenagers have been murdered, the survivors realize they are being hunted and decide to fight back.

The book received positive reviews from critics, who enjoyed the strange <a href="Crossover%20%28fiction%29">crossover</a> matchup and dark humor. The miniseries was the bestselling book for both publishers during its release and won a <a href="Ghastly%20Award">Ghastly Award</a> for Best Limited Series.

Since Archie Comics partnered with <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel Comics</a> for the 1994 <a href="One-shot%20%28comics%29">one-shot</a> comic "<a href="Archie%20Meets%20the%20Punisher">Archie Meets the Punisher</a>", the Archie characters have had a tradition of <a href="team-up">team-up</a>s with characters from other <a href="fictional%20universe">fictional universe</a>s. Following the success of "Archie meets <a href="Kiss%20%28band%29">KISS</a>" in 2012 and "Archie meets <a href="Glee%20%28TV%20series%29">Glee</a>" in 2013, the Archie Creative Summit held in March 2014 included a brainstorming session for new crossovers. <a href="Godzilla">Godzilla</a> and "<a href="Friday%20the%2013th%20%28franchise%29">Friday the 13th</a>" were considered, but the <a href="Predator%20%28alien%29">Predator</a> received the most support. Artist Fernando Ruiz was at the summit and liked the premise, but did not believe it would actually be made, or that he would be involved if it was.

Archie Comics proposed the crossover to <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a>, who owns the Predator character, and <a href="Dark%20Horse%20Comics">Dark Horse Comics</a>, who had licensed the character for comic books. Both quickly agreed. Dark Horse approached Alex de Campi to write based on her work on the horror comic book "Grindhouse" and the humorous comic book "". Dark Horse editor Brendan Wright, who was already editing the regular "Predator" comic book and had previously coordinated with Archie Comics on Dark Horse's "Archie Archives" reprints, was chosen as editor. Ruiz was the first and only artist considered to <a href="Penciller">pencil</a> the series, and <a href="inker">inker</a> Rich Koslowski was selected based on his work with Ruiz on a <a href="Thor%20%28Marvel%20Comics%29">Thor</a> parody in "Archie" #648. The project was originally titled "Archie meets Predator", but it was changed to "vs." because the people involved in production kept calling it that unintentionally, and to parody the "<a href="Alien%20vs.%20Predator">Alien vs. Predator</a>" franchise.

To prepare for the project, de Campi read over 4000 pages of Archie comic books. She drew inspiration for the story from the 1940s era of the series, when she says <a href="Archie%20Andrews">Archie Andrews</a>' girlfriends <a href="Betty%20Cooper">Betty Cooper</a> and <a href="Veronica%20Lodge">Veronica Lodge</a> had "more edge". Her scripts were subject to notes and tweaks from Archie Comics and Fox, but de Campi described both licensors as "extremely mellow, pleasant and easy to work with". Fox's primary concern was why the Predator, who is known for choosing challenging prey, would be interested in teenagers, but a suitable explanation was included in the story. She expected some of the notes, such as being told, "Alex, you can't make jokes about <a href="Child%20sexual%20abuse">child predation</a> in an Archie book". Other times, she was surprised when she did not receive notes, such as her use of <a href="emoji">emoji</a>s for the Predator's speech. She was pleased when she got to add depth to <a href="Dilton%20Doiley">Dilton Doiley</a>, a character she feels is often overlooked in regular "Archie" comics. The choice of whether Archie Andrews would survive the series or not was changed several times during scripting, and a final decision was not made until the last draft of the script.

Ruiz experimented with drawing the whole series in a more realistic manner, but from the beginning the plan was to use the traditional Archie design style for the book, which Archie veteran <a href="Dan%20DeCarlo">Dan DeCarlo</a> popularized in the classic comics since the 1960s. The editorial team felt this would make the story feel more "bizarre and unsettling". Although most modern comic art is created using digital tools and scans to accelerate the creation process, the art team for "Archie vs. Predator" chose to use traditional methods and used <a href="FedEx">FedEx</a> to get the physical copy of each page to the person who would complete the next step in the process.

Archie Comics and Dark Horse Comics jointly announced "Archie vs. Predator" and its creative team at the 2014 <a href="New%20York%20Comic%20Con">New York Comic Con</a>. Soon after, many media outlets carrying the news used a headline indicating the bizarre announcement was not a joke. Wright described it as his "most nutso project" and was continually surprised by the scale of positive reaction to it.

A promotional <a href="ashcan%20comic">ashcan comic</a> was released a couple of months before the first issue. It featured eight pages from the first issue and some of Ruiz's character designs, including some of his initial, more lifelike Predator sketches. The four issues were published monthly beginning April 15, 2015, and ending July 22, 2015. Each issue had two <a href="variant%20cover">variant cover</a>s, and the first issue had some additional <a href="Direct%20market%23Comic%20book%20specialty%20shops">store</a>-exclusive and <a href="Comic%20book%20convention">convention</a>-exclusive covers. All of the issues also included a one-page, humorous bonus strip written by de Campi featuring crossovers of other Archie and Dark Horse characters: "<a href="Sabrina%20Spellman">Sabrina</a> Meets <a href="Hellboy">Hellboy</a>" (art by <a href="Robert%20Hack">Robert Hack</a>), "Little <a href="The%20Mask">Mask</a> and his Pals" (art by <a href="Art%20Baltazar">Art Baltazar</a>), "<a href="Jughead%20Jones">Jughead</a> Meets <a href="MIND%20MGMT">MIND MGMT</a>: "S" is for Sleeper" (art by <a href="Matt%20Kindt">Matt Kindt</a>), and "<a href="Josie%20and%20the%20Pussycats%20%28comics%29">Josie and the Pussycats</a> Meet <a href="Finder%20%28comics%29">Finder</a>" (art by <a href="Carla%20Speed%20McNeil">Carla Speed McNeil</a>). A 128-page hardcover collecting the series and bonus content was released November 4, 2015.

When Archie and his friends take a <a href="spring%20break">spring break</a> trip to Los Perdidos Resort, an alien, trophy-hunting <a href="Predator%20%28alien%29">Predator</a> touches down in the nearby jungle. <a href="Betty%20Cooper">Betty</a> and <a href="Veronica%20Lodge">Veronica</a> get into a fight during a contest and attract the attention of the Predator, who follows them home to <a href="Riverdale%20%28Archie%20Comics%29">Riverdale</a>. While targeting Veronica, the Predator also kills several armed people. The creature's picture is taken by Betty, and <a href="Kevin%20Keller%20%28comics%29">Kevin Keller's</a> father, a US Military General, identifies it as a teenager from a race of nearly unstoppable alien hunters. The Kellers organize Archie's friends, and <a href="Jughead%20Jones">Jughead Jones</a> is used as bait to lure the Predator, but the trap fails and the Predator kills most of the ambush party.

Some members of the group decide to split up in hopes the Predator will continue to pursue Veronica, allowing them to escape, while Archie, Betty, Jughead and <a href="Dilton%20Doiley">Dilton Doiley</a> stay with Veronica. When the Predator attacks again, it kills Dilton and Jughead and critically wounds Archie. Betty and Veronica take refuge at Lodge Manor, where they hook Archie to an experimental healing machine. When the Predator attacks, Archie is killed and Veronica and Betty are critically wounded, which causes the Predator to show regret since it was motivated by a crush on Betty. Veronica recovers to find that Betty has used the healing machine to restore them both to full health and is now using it to transform the Predator into an Archie look-alike.

The first issue was the best-selling issue for both publishers in April 2015, and the 74th best selling comic book among other releases that month. Sales numbers fell just under 30% through the fourth issue, which was the 102nd best selling issue in July. When the hardcover was released in November, it was the 36th best-selling comics collection of the month according to <a href="Diamond%20Comic%20Distributors">Diamond Comic Distributors</a>.

The first issue garnered an average review rating of 7.9 out of 10 according to the <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Comic%20Book%20Roundup">Comic Book Roundup</a>. Writing for "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", Graeme Virtue said the "appealingly strange" series fit with Archie Comics' reputation for pushing comics forward and praised it for remaining true to both the Archie and Predator properties. The book's "deeply funny dark humor" was a selling point for Robin Parrish at "Tech Times", and <a href="IGN">IGN</a> reviewer Jeff Lake described the first issue as "pretty darn great". The use of the traditional cartoon art style to depict gruesome scenes was described as "a visual <a href="Innocence%23Loss%20of%20innocence">loss of innocence</a>" by "<a href="Paste%20%28magazine%29">Paste</a>" magazine. Comic Bastards' Dustin Cabeal called the miniseries "a hoot". The series won the 2015 <a href="Ghastly%20Award">Ghastly Award</a> for Best Limited Series.

Reger structured the text in four movements, as a <a href="choral%20symphony">choral symphony</a>. He scored it for a <a href="SATB">four-part choir</a> with often divided voices, a large <a href="symphony%20orchestra">symphony orchestra</a>, and <a href="Organ%20%28music%29">organ</a>. He requested additional brass players for the climax in the last movement when four trumpets and four trombones play the melody of Luther's <a href="chorale">chorale</a> "". Reger used both <a href="Romantic%20music">late-Romantic</a> features of <a href="Harmony%20%28music%29">harmony</a> and <a href="Dynamics%20%28music%29">dynamics</a>, and <a href="polyphony">polyphony</a> in the <a href="Baroque%20music">Baroque tradition</a>, culminating in the final movement, a <a href="double%20fugue">double fugue</a> with the added instrumental <a href="cantus%20firmus">cantus firmus</a>.

In 1922, the biographer Eugen Segnitz noted that this work, of intense expression, was unique in the sacred music of its period, with its convincing musical interpretation of the biblical text and manifold shades of emotion. <a href="Paul%20Hindemith">Paul Hindemith</a> wrote a trimmed adaption which probably helped to keep the work in the repertory, and François Callebout wrote an organ version, making the work accessible for smaller choirs. The organ version was first performed in 2003, in <a href="Wiesbaden">Wiesbaden</a> where the composer studied. The celebration of the Reger Year 2016, reflecting the <a href="centenary">centenary</a> of the composer's death, led to several performances of "Der 100. Psalm".

Born in Bavaria in 1873, Reger studied at the <a href="Wiesbaden">Wiesbaden</a> Conservatory and worked as a concert pianist and composer. <a href="Max%20Reger%20works">His work</a> focused first on chamber music, "<a href="Lied">Lied</a>", and choral music. In 1898, after he completed his studies, he returned to his parental home and focused on works for organ, continuing the tradition of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a>. Though raised as a <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a>, he was inspired by <a href="Lutheran%20hymn">Lutheran hymn</a>s, writing chorale fantasias such as <a href="Zwei%20Choralphantasien%2C%20Op.%2040">"Zwei Choralphantasien", Op.40</a>, in 1899. He moved to Munich in 1901. In 1902 he married <a href="Elsa%20Reger">Elsa vonBercken</a>, a divorced Protestant. In 1907 Reger was appointed professor at the <a href="Leipzig%20Conservatory">Royal Conservatory in Leipzig</a>. A year later he began the setting of <a href="Psalm%20100">Psalm 100</a> with the first movement.

Reger wrote the first part of the work for the 350th anniversary of <a href="Jena%20University">Jena University</a>. He based the composition on <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>'s translation of the psalm. Reger composed the first movement in Leipzig, beginning on 24April 1908 and working on it until early July. He dedicated it "" (To the High Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Jena for the 350th anniversary of the University). PartI was first performed on 31July 1908 at the ceremony marking the 350th anniversary. <a href="Fritz%20Stein">Fritz Stein</a> conducted the Akademischer Chor Jena and the "Sängerschaft zu St. Pauli", the band of the Erfurt Infantry Regiment 71, members of the Weimar court orchestra (Weimarer Hofkapelle) and organist Kurt Gorn. After the first performance, Reger received an <a href="Honorary%20degree">honorary doctorate</a> from Jena University. Reger demanded many rehearsals of the conductor and wrote to him: 
Reger completed the composition of the psalm by adding three more movements from May to August 1909. <a href="Edition%20Peters">Edition Peters</a> in Leipzig published the work, beginning in September 1909 with the vocal score, for which Reger prepared the <a href="piano%20reduction">piano reduction</a>. The full score and the <a href="Part%20%28music%29">parts</a> appeared in December that year. The complete work was premiered simultaneously on 23February 1910 in <a href="Chemnitz">Chemnitz</a> and <a href="Wroc%C5%82aw">Breslau</a>. In Chemnitz, Reger conducted at the church of St.Lukas the church choir and the municipal orchestra (Städtische Kapelle), with Georg Stolz at the organ. In Breslau, <a href="Georg%20Dohrn">Georg Dohrn</a> conducted the Sing-Akademie and the Orchester-Verein, with organist Max Ansorge. A reviewer wrote in the trade paper "Neue Musik-Zeitung": 

The text is Psalm 100, also known as the Jubilate Deo, in the translation by Martin Luther. The rather short psalm calls one to rejoice in the Lord, serve him with gladness, come before his countenance with joy, realize that he made us, and go enter his gates, because he is friendly ().

The call to rejoice leads to music that is especially suitable for festive occasions. The psalm has been set to music many times, mostly for liturgical use, for example by <a href="Giovanni%20Pierluigi%20da%20Palestrina">Palestrina</a> (1575) and <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lully">Lully</a>, who composed a <a href="motet">motet</a>, LWV77/16, in honor of the marriage of <a href="Louis%20XIV">Louis XIV</a> and peace with <a href="Spain">Spain</a> in 1660. In England, the Jubilate was traditionally combined with the <a href="Te%20Deum">Te Deum</a>, such as <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Henry Purcell</a>'s "Te Deum and Jubilate", and Handel's "<a href="Utrecht%20Te%20Deum%20and%20Jubilate">Utrecht Te Deum and Jubilate</a>". In German, Heinrich Schütz included a setting of Psalm100, along with an extended setting of Psalm119 and a <a href="Magnificat%20%28Sch%C3%BCtz%29">Magnificat</a>, in his final collection, known as "Opus ultimum" or "<a href="List%20of%20compositions%20by%20Heinrich%20Sch%C3%BCtz%23Schwanengesang">Schwanengesang</a>" (<a href="Swan%20song">Swan song</a>). A <a href="pasticcio">pasticcio</a> motet "<a href="Jauchzet%20dem%20Herrn%20alle%20Welt">Jauchzet dem Herrn alle Welt</a>" includes music by <a href="Georg%20Philipp%20Telemann">Georg Philipp Telemann</a> and J.S.Bach. The themes of the first psalm verses are paraphrased in the opening movement of Bach's 1734 "<a href="Christmas%20Oratorio">Christmas Oratorio</a>", , with a later contrasting section (Serve the Highest with splendid choirs).

<a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a>, who in 1928 had written an arrangement of the traditional tune associated with the psalm, "<a href="Old%20100th">Old 100th</a>" ("All people that on earth do dwell"), arranged it for congregation, organ, and orchestra for the coronation of <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> in 1953; it became ubiquitous at festive occasions in the Anglophone world. Reger's setting had not been intended for church use; it was written initially for a secular occasion and then for the concert hall.

Reger structured the text of the psalm in four movements as a <a href="choral%20symphony">choral symphony</a>, in the typical structure of a <a href="symphony">symphony</a>: first movement in <a href="sonata%20form">sonata form</a> ("Hauptsatz"), slow movement, scherzo, and finale. The following table is based on the choral score and shows the movement number, <a href="incipit">incipit</a>, the verse(s) of Psalm100, voices (<a href="SATB">SATB</a> chorus, at times divided further), marking, <a href="Key%20%28music%29">key</a> (beginning and ending in <a href="D%20major">D major</a>) and <a href="Time%20%28music%29">time</a>, using the symbol for <a href="Time%20signature%23Notational%20variations%20in%20simple%20time">common time</a>.

The work is scored for a four-part choir, with often divided voices, and an orchestra of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, three timpani and more percussion, organ, and strings. In the final movement, an additional brass ensemble of four trumpets and four trombones plays the <a href="cantus%20firmus">cantus firmus</a> of Luther's <a href="chorale">chorale</a> "". Reger used Lutheran hymns often in his work, in the tradition of Johann Sebastian Bach. He had already written a <a href="chorale%20fantasia">chorale fantasia</a> on the hymn, <a href="Ein%27%20feste%20Burg%20ist%20unser%20Gott%2C%20Op.%2027">"Ein' feste Burg ist unser Gott", Op.27</a> in 1898. Reger's harmonies are advanced and at times close to atonality, but he claimed that he did nothing that Bach had not done before: harmonies as the result of the <a href="Polyphony">polyphon</a> individual lines ("Stimmführung").
All movements are written in D major, but Reger often modulates. The movements follow each other without a break. A short instrumental introduction, marked , leads into the fourth movement. Reger achieves a unity of form by including material (both text and music) from the first movement in the later ones.

The first movement corresponds to the opening movement of a symphony, which is often in sonata form. The movement sets the first two verses of the psalm, which call for three actions: "" (rejoice), "" (serve), and "" (come). The three topics match two contrasting <a href="Theme%20%28music%29">theme</a>s of the exposition of the sonata form, and its <a href="Development%20%28music%29">development</a>. They are followed by a <a href="Recapitulation%20%28music%29">recapitulation</a> of the two themes.
A timpani roll on C of two measures leads to an orchestral Dmajor chord in the third measure, marked "ff" ("<a href="fortissimo">fortissimo</a>"), and a <a href="Syncope%20%28music%29">syncopated</a> entry of the choir one beat later, pronouncing in <a href="unison">unison</a> "" (Rejoice, rejoice), the first topic. The choir first sings a <a href="Motif%20%28music%29">motif</a> a <a href="Perfect%20fourth">fourth</a> downwards, while the strings add a <a href="Ornament%20%28music%29%23Turn">turn</a> motif ("") which gets repeated throughout the piece and finally opens a theme of the <a href="double%20fugue">double fugue</a> in Part4. The short motifs are treated to upward <a href="Sequence%20%28music%29">sequences</a>, then continued in upward <a href="Scale%20%28music%29">scale</a>s in <a href="Triplet%20%28music%29">triplets</a>, again in sequences, then another upward line in dotted rhythm, but no melody, rendering only the repeated word "" with different expression. Fred Kirshnit, who introduced the piece for a performance of the <a href="American%20Symphony%20Orchestra">American Symphony Orchestra</a>, regarded the treatment as an "orchestral explosion". The text is continued in measure16 by "" (to the Lord, [of] the whole world).

The following verse begins with "" (Serve), the second topic. It is quiet, marked and "pp" (<a href="pianissimo">pianissimo</a>). It has been compared to the second theme of the sonata form. From the lowest voice to the highest, the material is expanded in <a href="Imitation%20%28music%29">imitation</a>, with all voices divided. The phrase "" is first sung by the alto, and then imitated by the other voices. "" appears first in the lower voices while the sopranos expand the theme one measure later, marked and <a href="crescendo">crescendo</a>. Joyful groups of sixteenths appear, first in single voices, then in denser texture, leading to the first topic, "". In measure111 the third topic appears, "". This word is repeated many times before the phrase is continued, "" (before his face), later also "" (with shouts of joy). In measure130, a <a href="reprise">reprise</a> of the first section leads to a close of the movement in a unison "", with a <a href="fermata">fermata</a> on every syllable.

The second movement begins with a soft instrumental introduction of thirteen measures. Horns and trombones play the same note three times in unison, which is later sung with the word "" ("Realize" or Recognize"). Kirshnit writes that the movement begins "mysteriously, almost spectrally". The <a href="rhythm">rhythm</a> dominates the introduction. The choir picks up, singing it first on a unisonC, marked "ppp" (extremely soft). After several repetitions the phrase is continued in measure26: "" (that the Lord is God) with a rapid crescendo from Lord to God. The Swiss musicologist Michael Eidenbenz, writing for the <a href="Z%C3%BCrcher%20Bach%20Chor">Zürcher Bach Chor</a>, describes the section as mystical and reflective (""). In a middle section the divided voices express, mostly in <a href="homophony%20%28music%29">homophony</a>, and gradually more intensely: "" (He has made us, and not we ourselves, his people). The continuation "" (and the sheep of his pasture) is presented with expression by the lower voices, then repeated by pure <a href="Triad%20%28music%29">triad</a>s in <a href="A%20major">A major</a> and <a href="B%20major">B major</a>, first by three soprano parts, then three alto parts, and finally three male voices, with a solo violin.

As a first link to the first movements, the line "He has made us, and not we ourselves, his people" is repeated with the music used for "", connecting both the musical form and the content of being created God's people and serving him with gladness. The movement closes with a reprise of the first topic, this time ending pianissimo.

The key of <a href="F-sharp%20minor">F-sharp minor</a> and a triple meter are introduced by the orchestra. The divided female voices express in homophony and "dolcissimo": "" (Go enter his gates), with the measure most often divided in a halfnote and a quarter. The male voices answer "" (Go), and then the female voices repeat their line in a new version. The play is repeated, this time beginning with the male voices. The subsequent text appears in growing density and intensity, modulating constantly, ending in <a href="C%20major">C major</a>.

A short instrumental prelude reprises the orchestral motifs of the beginning of movement1. Simultaneously, soprano and tenor sing the two themes of a double fugue on the text "" (For the Lord is friendly). Both themes are lively, but have their fastest movement at different times. The melody of the soprano begins with the turn-motiv from the first movement, while the tenors sing mostly a rising broken Dmajor chord, with fast motion in the second measure. The alto takes the tenor melody, and the bass the soprano melody in their following entry. After an instrumental interlude from measure77, the themes appear in measure91 in bass and soprano, while the melody of Luther's "" is played by brass in unison. The work ends, slowing down majestically, with the text "" (and his truth forever and ever).

The biographer Eugen Segnitz wrote in 1922 that the work was not only unique in the composer's work, but in the sacred music of its period, with a rare intense power of expression ("intensive Ausdruckskraft") and a convincing musical <a href="exegesis">exegesis</a> of the biblical text, as well as its turns and manifold shades of emotion ("überzeugende musikalische Auslegung des biblischen Textes, wie auch seiner Wendungen und mannigfaltigen Gefühlsschattierungen").

A reviewer of a recording noted the work's "quasi-symphonic sequence" and its "balanced overall shape which brings musical satisfaction even though the choral-orchestral presentation is at times somewhat unrelenting". Eidenbenz noted that Reger achieved a direct expressivity of the smallest entities of material (""), and saw in this "atomization" and relentless modulation a modern radicality (""). He then wrote: 
Eidenbenz noted how these elements also characterize Reger's life.

In 1955, <a href="Paul%20Hindemith">Paul Hindemith</a> revised the work to achieve more clarity. According to Wolfgang Rathert, Hindemith "sought to moderate Reger's 'uncontrolled invention, while Kirshnit described Reger's original scoring as "gloriously polychromatic". Hindemith "thinned" the orchestra, especially the horns. In Reger's scoring, the organ reinforced the voices throughout the piece, resulting in a lack of clarity for the polyphonic passages. Hindemith used the organ only for climaxes. In the double fugue, he assigned one theme to a voice, but the other simultaneous theme to the orchestra. Hindemith's approach, which enables more analytical listening, seems justified by Reger's own scoring of later compositions which were more refined and focused. It is probably due to his version that "" enjoyed continuous presence in concert halls, while other works by Reger were neglected.

François Callebout wrote an organ version that was published in 2004 by <a href="Dr.%20J.%20Butz">Dr. J. Butz</a>. <a href="Gabriel%20Dessauer">Gabriel Dessauer</a> explains in the preface that Reger's work was conceived for oratorio choirs of up to 500 singers at the beginning of the 20thcentury. The organ version enables smaller choirs to perform the music. This version was premiered in 2003 by the <a href="Reger-Chor">Reger-Chor</a> in <a href="St.%20Bonifatius%2C%20Wiesbaden">St. Bonifatius, Wiesbaden</a>, the parish to which the composer belonged during his studies in Wiesbaden. The organ was played by <a href="Ignace%20Michiels">Ignace Michiels</a>, organist at the <a href="St.%20Salvator%20Cathedral">St. Salvator Cathedral</a> in Bruges.

Hanns-Friedrich Kaiser, KMD (director of church music) in <a href="Weiden%20in%20der%20Oberpfalz">Weiden</a>, where Reger grew up, wrote a version for choir and organ, which he conducted at the opening of the festival Reger-Tage at the church St. Michael on 16 September 2012, with organist Michael Schöch.

In 2016, a Reger Year reflecting the <a href="centenary">centenary</a> of Reger's death, the work was performed at the <a href="Thomaskirche">Thomaskirche</a> in Leipzig on 11May, on his day of death in the town where he died. The <a href="Thomanerchor">Thomanerchor</a>, the <a href="Leipziger%20Universit%C3%A4tschor">Leipziger Universitätschor</a> and the <a href="MDR%20Sinfonieorchester">MDR Sinfonieorchester</a> were conducted by <a href="David%20Timm">David Timm</a>. The concert was repeated on 26 May at the same location for the <a href="Katholikentag">Katholikentag</a>.

On 13 May, the <a href="Mitteldeutscher%20Rundfunk">MDR</a> aired a live concert recording from 1984 at the <a href="Kreuzkirche%2C%20Dresden">Kreuzkirche</a> in Dresden, performed by the <a href="Dresdner%20Kreuzchor">Dresdner Kreuzchor</a>, the Philharmonischer Chor Dresden, the <a href="Rundfunkchor%20Berlin">Rundfunkchor Berlin</a>, organist , and the <a href="Dresdner%20Philharmonie">Dresdner Philharmonie</a>, conducted by <a href="Martin%20Fl%C3%A4mig">Martin Flämig</a>. In June, the Kaiser conducted again his organ version in St. Michael in Weiden, with the Kantorei Weiden and organist Ute Steck. The Reger-Chor performed the organ version by Callebout in Bruges and Wiesbaden in August, again with Dessauer and Michiels.

Handel's lost Hamburg operas

In 1703, the 18-year-old composer <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">George Frideric Handel</a> took up residence in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, Germany, where he remained until 1706. During this period he composed four operas, only the first of which, "<a href="Almira">Almira</a>", has survived more or less intact. Of the other three, the music for "Nero" is lost, while only short orchestral excerpts from "<a href="Florindo">Florindo</a>" and "Daphne" survive.

Handel was born and grew up in <a href="Halle%20%28Saale%29">Halle</a>, where he received his early musical education and became an accomplished organist. In Hamburg he obtained employment as a violinist at the <a href="Oper%20am%20G%C3%A4nsemarkt">Oper am Gänsemarkt</a>, the city's famous opera house. Here, he learned the rudiments of opera composition, mainly under the influences of <a href="Reinhard%20Keiser">Reinhard Keiser</a>, the theatre's music director, and <a href="Johann%20Mattheson">Johann Mattheson</a>, its leading vocalist. The Gänsemarkt was largely dedicated to Keiser's compositions; his temporary absence in 1704 gave Handel his chance, and in quick succession he wrote "Almira" and "Nero" using librettos by <a href="Friedrich%20Christian%20Feustking">Friedrich Christian Feustking</a>. "Almira" was successful, "Nero" less so and was never performed after its initial run of three performances. Handel's final Hamburg operas, "Florindo" and "Daphne", based on librettos by Heinrich Hinsch and originally conceived as a giant single entity, were not produced at the Gänsemarkt before Handel left Hamburg for Italy in 1706.

No music that can be definitively traced to "Nero" has been identified, although Handel scholars have speculated that some of it may have been used in later works, particularly "<a href="Agrippina%20%28opera%29">Agrippina</a>" which has a related storyline and some of the same characters. Fragments of music from "Florindo" and "Daphne" have been preserved, although without the vocal parts, and some of these elements have been incorporated into an orchestral suite first recorded in 2012.

<a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">George Frideric Handel</a> was born on 23 February 1685 in the German city of <a href="Halle%20%28Saale%29">Halle</a>. It is unclear what initial musical education he received; his father, Georg Händel, was not a music lover, and did not at first appreciate or encourage his son's precocious talents. Nevertheless, by the age of ten Handel had become an accomplished organist; his playing in the royal chapel at <a href="Weissenfels">Weissenfels</a>, where his half-brother Karl was in the service of the <a href="Johann%20Adolf%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Weissenfels">Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels</a>, impressed the duke, who persuaded Händel senior that the boy should have a proper musical education. As a result, Handel began formal study under Friedrich Zachow, the organist of the Lutheran church at Halle.

Handel's biographer Jonathan Keates writes that: "From [Zachow] Handel learned not only a great deal about the line and shape of an aria, about strong, adventurous bass lines and solid choral writing, but also about those delicacies of instrumental colouring which he later perfected in his own style". Handel's musical development also benefited from an early and lasting friendship with <a href="Georg%20Philipp%20Telemann">Georg Philipp Telemann</a>, whom he met in 1700. In February 1702 Handel enrolled at the <a href="Martin%20Luther%20University%20of%20Halle-Wittenberg">University of Halle</a>, perhaps intending to study law. In March he took up the post of organist at Halle's <a href="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> cathedral (Domkirche), a prestigious appointment for one so young and indicative of his burgeoning musical reputation in the city.

At some time, possibly in late 1702 or early 1703, Handel visited Berlin, where his father had held an honorary post as physician to the <a href="Prince-elector">elector</a> who, in 1701, had become the Prussian king <a href="Frederick%20I%20of%20Prussia">Frederick I</a>. In Berlin Handel first experienced Italian opera, and may have met the Italian composers <a href="Giovanni%20Bononcini">Giovanni Bononcini</a> and <a href="Attilio%20Ariosti">Attilio Ariosti</a>, who were writing operas for Frederick's court. The king heard of Handel's abilities, and wanted him to train as a future court composer, but Handel's horizons had been broadened by his sojourn in Berlin and he was developing his own ideas for his future. He declined the king's offer, and returned to Halle to fulfil his year's contract at the Domkirche. With few career prospects available in his home city, Handel would have liked to go to Italy, but this, he realised, was not yet practicable, since he lacked both cash and contacts. Instead in mid-1703 he left Halle for <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, a thriving free city which housed the leading opera house in northern Germany.

The Hamburg Opera, known as the <a href="Oper%20am%20G%C3%A4nsemarkt">Oper am Gänsemarkt</a>, was the first public opera house to be established outside Italy. The brainchild of the exiled <a href="Christian%20Albert%2C%20Duke%20of%20Holstein-Gottorp">Duke of Schleswig-Gottorf</a> and his <a href="Kapellmeister">Kapellmeister</a>, <a href="Johann%20Theile">Johann Theile</a>, it was designed by <a href="Girolamo%20Sartorio">Girolamo Sartorio</a>, and modelled on the <a href="Teatro%20Santi%20Giovanni%20e%20Paolo">Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo</a> in <a href="Venice">Venice</a>. Its construction was opposed by the clergy and cathedral hierarchy, but enthusiastically supported by the city's municipal authorities. Built in 1677 on a lavish scale, with a reported capacity of 2,000, it boasted an exceptionally deep stage and was, according to Handel scholars <a href="Winton%20Dean">Winton Dean</a> and <a href="John%20Merrill%20Knapp">John Merrill Knapp</a>, one of the best-equipped theatres of its time.

Dean and Knapp write that the theatre's history was "enlivened and envenomed by a maelstrom of controversy, pursued in pamphlets, broadsheets, sermons and prefaces to librettos ... and by financial crises which persisted on and off throughout the sixty years of its existence". A preponderance of biblically inspired works in the earliest years was soon replaced by a range of more secular subjects, often drawn from Roman history and myth, or from recent events such as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vienna">1683 siege of Vienna</a>. Performances tended to be of considerable length, often extending to six hours. The 18-year-old Handel entered this hectic environment in mid-1703, to take up a place in the theatre's orchestra as a "ripieno" (ensemble) second violin.

Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of <a href="Reinhard%20Keiser">Reinhard Keiser</a>, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded <a href="Johann%20Kusser">Johann Kusser</a> as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under <a href="Johann%20Schelle">Johann Schelle</a> and probably <a href="Johann%20Kuhnau">Johann Kuhnau</a> at the <a href="Thomasschule%20zu%20Leipzig">Thomasschule zu Leipzig</a>. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at <a href="Braunschweig">Brunswick</a>, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which ("Mahumeth") was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.

It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer <a href="Johann%20Mattheson">Johann Mattheson</a>, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, "he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: "He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas", before, it seems, "the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions".

In 1704, Keiser, seeking refuge from his creditors, temporarily left Hamburg for <a href="Weissenfels">Weissenfels</a> in Saxony, near to his hometown Teuchern. He took with him his donkey and his most recent opera composition, "<a href="Almira">Almira</a>", a setting of a libretto by <a href="Friedrich%20Christian%20Feustking">Friedrich Christian Feustking</a>, thus denying this work to the Gänsemarkt—Keiser produced it in Weissenfels in July 1704. In these circumstances the temporary management turned to the 19-year-old Handel and requested a fresh setting of Feustking's libretto. Handel complied; his version was premiered at the Gänsemarkt on 8 January 1705, and ran for 20 performances—a marked success.

The fictional plot appears to have originated from Giuseppe Boniventi's opera, "L'Almira", with a libretto by Giulio Pancieri, performed in Venice in 1691. The relatively light-hearted story, typical of 17th-century dramatic conventions, is told in three acts and records the machinations surrounding the newly crowned queen Almira's secret love for her secretary, Fernando, in opposition to her dead father's dying wish that she marry someone from the family of her guardian Consalvo. Keates writes of the work: "The whole thing belongs very much to its Venetian baroque world ... full of intrigue interlaced with comedy and ballet." These features, even the mixture of languages between Italian and German, often recur in Handel's later work. The music, which has been preserved largely through a conducting score prepared by Telemann, reflects Handel's debt to Keiser and displays a variety of traditions: a French-style overture, German-influenced orchestration, and Italianate vocal writing. Dean and Knapp summarise the score as "very uneven in style, quality and technique, with abundant promise but intermittent fulfilment".

The success of "Almira" prompted the Gänsemarkt management to follow it almost immediately with a second Handel setting, "Die durch Blut und Mord erlangete Lieb; oder, Nero" ("The love obtained through blood and murder; or, Nero") generally known as "Nero", again based on a Feustking libretto. The libretto survives intact, but the music is entirely lost. Dean and Knapp record that a copy of Handel's manuscript score was held in the library of the Hamburg impresario J.C. Westphal until 1830, when it was sold and thereafter disappeared. The whole work incorporates 20 ensembles and 57 arias.

Feustking's libretto was written entirely in German, its probable sources being the ancient histories of <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> and <a href="Suetonius">Suetonius</a>. The text has been widely criticised for its low quality; <a href="Friedrich%20Chrysander">Friedrich Chrysander</a> wrote of it: "There is no spirit in the verse, and one feels vexation in setting such stuff to music". A later critic, Paul Henry Lang, cites the "miserable quality" of the libretto as the principal reason for the opera's failure. Dean and Knapp suggest that the main fault is that Feustking fatally over-complicates the main story by incorporating sub-plots, unnecessary extra characters, and "every stock device known to the operatic repertory". These intrusions include disguises, mistaken identities, a much-ridiculed philosopher, a comic servant and a play within the play. Many of the characters are historical, including <a href="Nero">Nero</a>, <a href="Claudia%20Octavia">Octavia</a>, <a href="Poppaea%20Sabina">Poppea</a>, Nero's mother <a href="Agrippina%20the%20Younger">Agrippina</a>, and <a href="Seneca%20the%20Younger">Seneca</a> the philosopher. Several of these appear in Handel's later (1709) opera "<a href="Agrippina%20%28opera%29">Agrippina</a>". Another real-life figure who appears in "Nero" is <a href="Anicetus%20%28pirate%29">Anicetus</a>, who historically is held to have murdered Agrippina on Nero's behalf. Described in the libretto as "des Kaysers Mignon oder Liebling" ("The emperor's little one, or darling"), Anicetus is Handel's only openly gay operatic character.

As listed and described in Burrows "et al.": "George Frideric Handel: Volume 1, 1609–1725: Collected Documents" (2011).

The main story, told over three acts, follows generally that of <a href="Giovanni%20Francesco%20Busenello">Busenello</a>'s libretto for <a href="Claudio%20Monteverdi">Monteverdi</a>'s 1642 opera "<a href="L%27incoronazione%20di%20Poppea">L'incoronazione di Poppea</a>". It recounts Nero's various schemes to replace his current queen Octavia with his mistress Poppea, against the urgings of his mother Agrippina and the philosopher Seneca. A sub-plot introduces <a href="Tiridates%20I%20of%20Armenia">Tiridates</a>, crown prince of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Armenia%20%28antiquity%29">Armenia</a>, another historical figure who, in the opera, is betrothed to the fictional Cassandra but is secretly pursuing Poppea in rivalry with the emperor. Octavia and Cassandra provide each other with mutual support in their trials, while Agrippina allies with Octavia and narrowly escapes death from a piece of falling masonry. In turn, she tries unsuccessfully to persuade Seneca to kill Nero. As a stratagem to secure Tiridates's love, Cassandra disguises herself and informs him of her death, which news temporarily deranges him. Anicetus further complicates matters by falling in love with Octavia. As these events develop, the servant Graptus provides a mocking, ironic commentary. Nero's play, "The Judgement of Paris", and a representation of the burning of Rome occupy much of Act III. After these many digressions the opera concludes with the banishment of Octavia, the incarceration of Agrippina, the return of his senses to Tiridates when he learns that Cassandra is alive, and a joyful and triumphant double coronation: Nero and Poppea, and Tiridates and Cassandra.

"Nero" opened on 25 February 1705, with Mattheson in the title role. Its staging so closely after "Almira's" run indicates that it was probably composed, in part or in whole, during 1704. There are no surviving accounts of its public reception, but it clearly proved less successful than its predecessor, running for just three performances before the theatre closed for the <a href="Lenten">Lenten</a> season. When the Gänsemarkt reopened the opera was not revived, and was never performed again.

Although there is no extant music that can be positively identified with "Nero", there is a possibility that some of it may have been used in later works. John E. Sawyer, in his analysis of "Agrippina", reveals that this work, composed five years after "Nero" with similar characters, "contains the highest proportion of borrowed material of any of the composer's major dramatic works", and Dean and Knapp speculate as to whether it also incorporates borrowings from "Nero". According to the Handel scholar Charles Cudworth, the suite of dances that follows the overture to Handel's 1707 opera <a href="Rodrigo%20%28opera%29">"Rodrigo"</a> (his first after leaving Hamburg), could very well have begun as ballet music in "Nero" or another of the lost Hamburg operas. The musicologist <a href="Bernd%20Baselt">Bernd Baselt</a> has raised the possibility that Handel's Harpsichord Suite in G Minor, HWV 453, is an arrangement of the overture to "Nero". A version of this suite, reconstructed for orchestra by <a href="Peter%20Holman">Peter Holman</a>, is included in a selection of Handel's Hamburg music, issued by <a href="Hyperion%20Records">Hyperion Records</a> in January 2012.

Following its closure at the start of the 1705 Lenten season, the Gänsemarkt did not reopen until August, by which time Keiser had returned from Weissenfels to produce his opera "<a href="Octavia%20%28opera%29">Octavia</a>". From this point, Handel's regular connection with the theatre appears to have diminished. Although he remained in Hamburg for a further year, his main source of income was from private lessons, as he saved for his long-desired visit to Italy. He nevertheless accepted a commission from the Gänsemarkt to compose a setting for a large-scale opera based on the Greek myth of <a href="Apollo%20and%20Daphne">Apollo and Daphne</a>. With its rambling plot and an assortment of dances and other set pieces—almost 100 musical numbers in all—the work was eventually divided into two separate operas, for performance on successive nights. The two sections were given the formal names "Der beglückte Florindo" ("Florindo made happy") and "Die verwandelte Daphne" ("Daphne metamorphosed"), but are generally known as "Florindo" and "Daphne". It is not known when Handel wrote the music. He may have completed it in 1705–06 while still in Hamburg, or it may have been composed in Italy after arriving there in the latter part of 1706.

The text is by Heinrich (sometimes rendered as "Hinrich") Hinsch, an established Gänsemarkt librettist whose stated intention was adapting stories to provide "a pleasurable poetic experience", to "[titillate] the senses of its audience without attempting to address their reason or understanding". In this case he took as his base material the episode of Phoebus (Apollo) and Daphne as told in Book 1 of <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>'s "<a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>", but added a plethora of new characters and incidents which move the story significantly away from the Ovidian original. The main language is German, but the presence of several ensembles and arias in Italian leads Dean and Knapp to speculate that Hinsch may have used an Italian libretto as his source. The "Florindo" and "Daphne" libretti were published in the "Händel-Jahrbuch", in 1984 and 1985 respectively, and in facsimile form in 1989 as part of a 13-volume edited by Ellen T. Harris.

The preface to the Florinda libretto explains Hinsch's choice of titles: "The first of [the two parts] presents the Pythean festival, instituted in honour of Phoebus (Apollo), and the betrothal of Florinda and Daphne which took place on the same day, so it receives the title 'Florindo made happy'. The other part represents Daphne's stubborn resistance to Phoebus's love, also the abhorrence she feels for all love, and finally her metamorphosis into a laurel tree, from which it receives the title 'Daphne metamorphosed' ".

As listed and described in Burrows "et al.": " George Frideric Handel: Volume 1, 1609–1725: Collected Documents" (2011).

"Florindo" opens with celebrations to mark Apollo's victory over the dragon Python. Apollo boasts that he is more proficient with the bow than Cupid. This offends the latter, who mischievously wounds Apollo with a drugged arrow which causes him to fall in love with Daphne. She, however, has pledged her love for Florindo, who is at the centre of a complex tangle of infatuations: he is secretly loved by Alfirena and more openly by the scheming shepherdess Lycoris, who in turn is the object of the shepherd Damon's desires. The various would-be lovers are consoled or advised by Damon's friend Thyrsis, and by the ageing nymph Galathea, who has herself not quite given up on love, though her advances to Thyrsis are rejected. Daphne and Florindo prepare to marry, but Apollo remains hopeful and continues his suit. Lycoris is prepared to await the outcome of events, but Damon, Galathea and Alfirena are in despair, as the opera ends with another spectacular celebration in honour of Apollo.

The second opera, "Daphne", begins as the wedding of Florindo and Daphne gets under way. Cupid, bent on more mischief, wounds Daphne with a special arrow, forged by the god Vulcan, that causes her to renounce all love. She abandons the wedding and announces that she will join the goddess Diana and become a huntress. This sparks a series of schemes and counter-schemes as both Apollo and Florindo continue to pursue Daphne while the other would-be lovers manoeuvre for position. Lycoris assures Apollo that Daphne's abandonment of the wedding was a signal that she favours him. Lycoris also steals Daphne's cloak and, wearing it as a disguise, makes advances to Damon, having first ensured that Florindo overhears. Florindo is enraged by what he believes is Daphne's duplicity, and denounces her. Damon confirms the story. Daphne, bewildered, pleads with her father Peneus to prove her innocence; he responds by transforming her into a laurel tree. Cupid blames Apollo's pride for the fiasco, but gives him the laurel as his "special tree". Florindo now accepts Alfirena, and Lycoris, having confessed her scheming, is united with Damon. Only the guiltless Daphne ends up losing everything.

Dean and Knapp record that in early 1707 Keiser surrendered the lease of the Gänsemarkt to Johann Heinrich Sauerbrey, who thus became responsible for the staging of the double opera. It may by this time have been in rehearsal, and the difficulties involved in such a complex and elaborate work may have necessitated several postponements. The consensus among experts is that the two parts were first performed on consecutive evenings in January 1708, as they are the first works in Mattheson's opera list for 1708. There are no surviving records of the public's reception, the length of the original run, or of any revivals. Whether Handel was present at any time during rehearsals or performance is uncertain; he may have returned from Italy, fresh from the opening of "Rodrigo" in <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, to supervise the production of "Florindo" and "Daphne" in Hamburg. Dean and Knapp suggest the works may have been directed from the harpsichord by <a href="Christoph%20Graupner">Christoph Graupner</a>, although <a href="Anthony%20Hicks">Anthony Hicks</a> in his "<a href="The%20New%20Grove%20Dictionary%20of%20Music%20and%20Musicians">Grove</a>" Handel biography, says that so unusual a project would not have been attempted without the composer's presence.

The theatre's management was clearly concerned that the public might find the double opera too heavy in undiluted form. Accordingly, a comic intermezzo in <a href="Low%20German">Low German</a> dialect ("platte-deutsch") was devised by Sauerbrey to precede the performance of "Daphne". The critic and essayist <a href="Romain%20Rolland">Romain Rolland</a>, in his life of Handel, termed this a "mutilation", carried out "for fear that the music may tire the hearers".

A few fragments of music from the twin operas survive. The <a href="Newman%20Flower">Newman Flower</a> collection at <a href="Manchester%20Central%20Library">Manchester Central Library</a> holds three arias and a chorus, in full orchestral score but with the vocal parts missing. A blank stave with a soprano clef suggests that the three arias were written for soprano voice. The chorus has been identified by Baselt with "Streue, O Braütigam", from Act 1 of "Daphne". Two of the arias are tentatively associated with "Mie speranza, andate" from Act 1 of "Florindo", and "Mostrati più crudele" from the third act of "Daphne". The third aria has not been identified.

The Royal Music Collection at the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a> houses the manuscripts of instrumental pieces, mainly dances, that belong to "Florindo" and "Daphne". A group of eight short pieces have been catalogued as two four-movement suites, HWV352 and HWV353. The British Library collection includes a further group of four movements, scored for string orchestra, which has been catalogued as HWV354.

As with "Nero", it is possible that music from "Florindo" or "Daphne" was recycled by Handel for use in later works. The overture to the opera "Rodrigo" consists of eight French-style dances, which Cudworth believes might have begun life as ballet music in one or other of the lost Hamburg operas. In 1709–10 Handel composed the cantata "<a href="Apollo%20e%20Dafne%20%28Handel%29">Apollo e Dafne</a>", which has common ground with the earlier operas. Harris makes the point that when writing the cantata, Handel would have recalled his earlier setting, and perhaps borrowed from it. Dean and Knapp provide further example of works in which the "Florinda" and "Daphne" music may have re-emerged: the oratorio "Il trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno" (1707); the opera "<a href="Radamisto%20%28Handel%29">Radamisto</a>" (1720); and the overture in B flat, HWV336, which Baselt conjectures might have been written as the overture to "Florindo". This last-named has been combined with HWV352–354 and HWV356 to form the "Suite from the operas Florindo and Daphne", which in 2012 was adapted and recorded by The Parley of Instruments under Peter Holman.

Handel's Hamburg years provided him with a composing apprenticeship, particularly although not exclusively as a writer of opera. The influence of Keiser, which began during this period, was significant throughout Handel's career. Apart from his lifelong habit of "borrowing" fragments from Keiser's operas for use in his own works, he adopted and retained many of his mentor's compositional characteristics; according to Hicks, "[Handel] never relinquished French forms for overtures and dance music, and his use of orchestral colour, particularly the occasional instrumental doubling of the voice "<a href="Glossary%20of%20musical%20terminology">colla parte</a>", was derived from German models".

The loss of much of Handel's early work was first noted by his earliest biographer, Mainwaring (1760), who refers to "a great quantity of music" from Hamburg and Italy, adding that it was not known how much of it still existed. On departing from Hamburg, Handel spent a further three years in Italy before settling in London, where he remained the dominant composer of Italianate opera for the following thirty years. After his Hamburg initiation, Handel composed more than forty operas, beginning with "Rodrigo" in 1707, and ending in 1740 with "<a href="Deidamia%20%28opera%29">Deidamia</a>". These works were quickly forgotten after Handel's death; modern revivals did not begin until the 1920s. Dean and Knapp believe that, despite the years of relative neglect, Handel's achievements as a composer of opera entitle him to rank alongside <a href="Claudio%20Monteverdi">Monteverdi</a>, <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>, <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi</a>, and <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a> as one of the supreme masters of the genre.

Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi

Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi (; A Virgilian Cento Concerning the Glory of Christ) is a Latin poem arranged by <a href="Faltonia%20Betitia%20Proba">Faltonia Betitia Proba</a> ( AD 352384) after her <a href="Christianization">conversion to Christianity</a>. A "<a href="cento%20%28poetry%29">cento</a>" is a poetic work composed of verses or passages taken from other authors and re-arranged in a new order. This poem reworks verses extracted from the work of <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a> to tell stories from the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old</a> and <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> of the Christian <a href="Bible">Bible</a>. Much of the work focuses on the <a href="Life%20of%20Jesus%20in%20the%20New%20Testament">story of Jesus Christ</a>.

While scholars have proposed a number of hypotheses to explain why the poem was written, a definitive answer to this question remains elusive. Regardless of Proba's intent, the poem would go on to be widely circulated, and it eventually was used in schools to teach the tenets of Christianity, often alongside <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a>'s "<a href="De%20doctrina%20Christiana">De doctrina Christiana</a>". But while the poem was popular, critical reception was more mixed. A pseudonymous work purportedly by <a href="Pope%20Gelasius%20I">Pope Gelasius I</a> disparaged the poem, deeming it <a href="apocryphal">apocryphal</a>, and many also believe that St. <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> wrote negatively of Proba and her poem. Other thinkers like <a href="Isidore%20of%20Seville">Isidore of Seville</a>, <a href="Petrarch">Petrarch</a>, and <a href="Giovanni%20Boccaccio">Giovanni Boccaccio</a> wrote highly of Proba, and many praised her ingenuity. During the 19th and 20th centuries the poem was criticized as being of poor quality, but recent scholars have held the work in higher regard.

The author of the poem, <a href="Faltonia%20Betitia%20Proba">Faltonia Betitia Proba</a>, was born AD 322. A member of an influential, aristocratic family, she eventually married a prefect of Rome named <a href="Clodius%20Celsinus%20Adelphius">Clodius Celsinus Adelphius</a>. Proba wrote poetry, and according to contemporary accounts, her first work was titled "Constantini bellum adversus Magnentium"; this poem, which is now <a href="Lost%20work">lost</a>, recounted the <a href="Roman%20civil%20war%20of%20350%E2%80%93353">war</a> between Roman Emperor <a href="Constantius%20II">Constantius II</a> and the <a href="Roman%20usurper">usurper</a> <a href="Magnentius">Magnentius</a> that occurred between AD 35053. At some point, Proba converted from paganism to Christianity, and "De laudibus Christi", which was probably written AD 352384, was her attempt to "turn away from battle and slayings in order to write holy things".

With the exception of the <a href="wiktionary%3Aproem">proem</a> and invocation of the poem, the entirety of "De laudibus Christi" is a <a href="cento%20%28poetry%29">cento</a> (i.e. a patchwork poem) made up of rearranged verses extracted from the works of the Roman poet <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>. Proba's choice to rework Virgil seems to have been made for two reasons: First, Virgil was an influential poet who had been commissioned by <a href="Caesar%20Augustus">Caesar Augustus</a>, the first Roman emperor, to write the mytho-historical epic "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>". Arguably the most influential Roman poet, Virgil's artistic clout was immense, being felt well into <a href="late%20antiquity">late antiquity</a>, and he was imitated by <a href="Late%20Latin">Late Latin</a> poets like <a href="Juvencus">Juvencus</a> and <a href="Prudentius">Prudentius</a>. The respect given to Virgil often manifested in the form of centos, which reached peak popularity in the fourth century AD. Second, Virgil was often seen as a pre-Christian prophet due to a popular interpretation of his <a href="Eclogue%204">fourth Eclogue</a>, which many <a href="Christian%20interpretations%20of%20Virgil%27s%20Eclogue%204">believed foretold the birth of Jesus</a>.

Hardly any names are present in "De laudibus Christi". This is because Virgil never used Hebrew names like "Jesus" and "Mary", and thus Proba was limited in terms of what she was able to work with. To compensate, Proba used vague words like "mater" ("mother"), "pater" ("father"), "deus" ("god"), and "vates" ("poet" or "priest") to refer to key Judeo-Christian figures. In places, this handicap interferes with readability (according to G. Ronald Kastner and Ann Millin, "Necessary passives and circumlocutions brought about by the ... absences in [Virgil] of appropriate terminology render the text impassable at times"). An exception to the poem's lack of names is found in a reference to <a href="Moses">Moses</a>, whom Proba refers to by invoking the name "<a href="Musaeus%20of%20Athens">Musaeus</a>". According to the <a href="classicist">classicist</a> Sigrid Schottenius Cullhed, "Proba [probably] used the name Musaeus for the Judeo-Christian prophet, since it was often believed from the Hellenistic era onward that Mousaios was the Greek name for Moses".

The cento's 694 lines are divided into a proem and invocation (lines 155), select stories from the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> books of <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Genesis</a> (lines 56318) and <a href="Book%20of%20Exodus">Exodus</a> (lines 31932), select stories from the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> <a href="Gospel">Gospel</a>s (lines 333686), and an epilogue (lines 68794). At the beginning of the poem, Proba references her earlier foray into poetry before rejecting it in the name of <a href="Jesus">Christ</a>. This section also serves as an inversion and thus rejection of the Virgilian tradition: whereas Virgil opened the "Aeneid" by proclaiming that he will "sing of weapons and a man" ("arma virumque cano"), Proba rejects warfare as a subject worthy of Christian poetry. Proba then describes herself as a prophet ("vatis Proba") and calls upon God and the <a href="Holy%20Spirit%20%28Christianity%29">Holy Spirit</a> (eschewing the traditional invocation of the <a href="Muses">Muses</a>) to aid her in her work. At the end of the invocation, Proba states her poem's main purpose: to "tell how Virgil sang the offices of Christ."

The passages focusing on the Old Testament concern the <a href="Genesis%20creation%20narrative">creation of the world</a>, the <a href="Fall%20of%20Man">Fall of Man</a>, the <a href="Genesis%20flood%20narrative">Great Flood</a>, and <a href="The%20Exodus">the Exodus from Egypt</a>. Proba's presentation of the Creationlargely based on rewordings of Virgil's "<a href="Georgics">Georgics</a>"reorganizes the Genesis narrative to better align it with contemporary Greco-Roman beliefs about the origin of the world. Cullhed argues that certain aspects of the creation story are "abbreviated ... amplified or even transposed" so that Proba can avoid repetitive passages, such as the double creation of man (Genesis 1:25–27 and Genesis 2:18–19). In the events leading to the Fall of Man, Eve's actions are largely based on the story of <a href="Dido">Dido</a> from Book IV of the "Aeneid", thereby "repeatedly foreshadowing ... the imminent disaster of the Fall". The <a href="Serpents%20in%20the%20Bible%23Eden">Serpent</a> is described with lines that detail <a href="Laoco%C3%B6n">Laocoön</a>'s death (from Book II, "Aeneid") and the snake sent by the <a href="Furies">fury</a> <a href="Alecto">Alecto</a> to enrage Amata (from Book VII, "Aeneid"). Proba relies on the first two books of the "Georgics" (specifically, the sections that discuss the <a href="Ages%20of%20Man">Iron Age of Man</a>) to describe human life after Adam and Eve eat the fruit from the <a href="tree%20of%20the%20knowledge%20of%20good%20and%20evil">tree of the knowledge of good and evil</a>; in this way, she connects the Greco-Roman concept of the Ages of Man with the Judeo-Christian concept of the Fall of Man.

After the story of Creation, Proba briefly references the Great Flood by making use of lines from the fourth book of the "Georgics" that originally discussed the death of a <a href="beehive">beehive</a> and the necessity of laws after the end of the Golden Age, respectively. According to the classicist <a href="Karla%20Pollmann">Karla Pollmann</a>, by using lines that concern destruction and the establishment of law, Proba is able to convey the traditional idea that Noah's survival represents the dawning of a "second creation and a new order" (that is, the <a href="Patriarchal%20age">Patriarchal age</a>). Proba dedicates only a few lines to Exodus before moving onto the New Testament. Cullhed reasons that this is because the Book of Exodus and the remaining Old Testament is replete with violence and warfare that is stylistically too close to the tradition of pagan epic poetrya tradition that Proba expressly rejects in the proem of "De laudibus Christi". In the transitional section between the Old and New Testaments, Proba appropriates the invocation of the Muses of war that immediately precedes the Catalogue of Italians (from Book VII, "Aeneid") and verses that originally described Aeneas's prophetic shield (from Book VIII, "Aeneid"). According to Culhed, these verses originally functioned as poetic devices, enabling Virgil to move from the "Odyssean" first half of the poem to the "Iliadic" latter half. Proba likewise has re-purposed these verses to aid in her transition from the Old Testament into the New.

The portion of "De laudibus Christi" that focuses on the New Testament recounts the <a href="Nativity%20of%20Christ">birth of Jesus</a>, his <a href="Life%20of%20Jesus%20in%20the%20New%20Testament">life and deeds</a>, his <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">crucifixion</a>, and the advent of the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>. Although Jesus and <a href="Mary%2C%20mother%20of%20Jesus">Mary</a> are featured, <a href="Saint%20Joseph">Joseph</a> is omitted. Jesus is often described by language befitting a Virgilian hero, and Mary is depicted by lines originally relating to <a href="Venus%20%28goddess%29">Venus</a> and Dido. Proba's <a href="Sermon%20on%20the%20Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a> begins by borrowing the <a href="Sibyl%20of%20Cumae">Sibyl of Cumae</a>'s description of punishment for the unrighteous (from Book VI, "Aeneid"), and some scholars contend that this portion of "De laudibus Christi" is the first description of <a href="Hell%23Christianity">hell</a> in Christian poetry. Christ's deeds are reduced to three events: <a href="Calming%20the%20storm">calming the sea</a>, <a href="Jesus%20walking%20on%20water">walking on water</a>, and the <a href="First%20disciples%20of%20Jesus">call of the disciples</a>. To describe Christ's crucifixion, Proba uses several lines that originally related to warfare, destruction, and death, such as the battle between Aeneas and the Rutuli (from Book XII, "Aeneid"), the <a href="Trojan%20War%23Sack%20of%20Troy">Sack of Troy</a> (from Book II), and the suffocation of Laocoön by giant serpents (from Book II). Notably, Christ is crucified not on a cross, but an oak tree, which Cullhed argues "synthesizes Jewish, Roman and Christian religious codes", as the species of tree was associated in the Greco-Roman world with Jupiter, and in the Judeo-Christian tradition with the <a href="Binding%20of%20Isaac">Binding of Isaac</a>. After covering Christ's death, Proba borrows lines referring to the erotic love between Dido and <a href="Aeneas">Aeneas</a> to represent the decidedly more spiritual love that Christ shares with his disciples. The end of the poem focuses on Christ describing the world to come and his <a href="Ascension%20of%20Jesus">ascension into Heaven</a>; Proba conveys the former via the prophecy made by both <a href="Celaeno">Celaeno</a> and the <a href="Delos">Oracle of Delos</a> (both from Book III, "Aeneid"), and the latter with language that originally described the god <a href="Mercury%20%28god%29">Mercury</a>.

Due to her borrowing from Virgil, Proba's Christ is very similar to the Virgilian epic hero. Parallels between the two include both seeking a goal greater than their own happiness, initiating realms "without end", and projecting auras of divinity. According to the early Christian specialist <a href="Elizabeth%20A.%20Clark">Elizabeth A. Clark</a> and the classicist Diane Hatch, Proba's purpose was to "imbue the Christ with heroic virtues" akin to the Virgilian hero. The poet does this in three major ways: First, she describes Jesus as remarkably beautiful, with "a magnificent and commanding presence" similar to that of Aeneas. Second, during the Crucifixion, Jesus does not go meekly to his death, but aggressively lashes out at his persecutors. Her reconfiguration of Jesus's crucifixion is thus in line with Aeneas' vindictive slaying of <a href="Turnus">Turnus</a> described at the very end of the "Aeneid". Finally, Proba transfers to Jesus portions of prophecies scattered throughout the "Aeneid" that detail Rome's glorious future, thus recasting pagan oracles in a Christian light.

The characterization of Mary has caused much scholarly debate. The historian Kate Cooper sees Mary as a courageous, intelligent "materfamilias". Clark and Hatch write that Proba stresses Mary's maternity by omitting Joseph and presenting Mary as Jesus's sole human parent. Conversely, the <a href="Latinist">Latinist</a> Stratis Kyriakidis argues that despite Mary's presence in the poem, she lacks feminine attributes, and is thus "impersonal". According to Kyriakidis, this is intentional on Proba's part, as it draws attention to Christ's divinityan aspect that "would be incompatible with a human, feminine mother."

Cullhed writes that the most scholarly views of Mary in the poem are inadequate, and that Proba made Mary "the twofold fulfillment and <a href="Typology%20%28theology%29">antitype</a> of both Eve and Dido." Cullhed bases this on the fact that line 563 of the fourth book of the "Aeneid" (from Mercury's speech to Aeneas, in which the god admonishes the hero for lingering with Dido in <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a>) is used in two of the sections of the cento: once, in which Adam admonishes Eve for sinning, and again, in which Mary learns that Herod wants to kill her child. According to Cullhed, the "negative characterization" of the original verse and its reuse in the Old Testament portion of the cento is transformed into a "positively charged ability" allowing Mary and Jesus to escape Herod's wrath. Because Mary can foretell the future, she is compared (through the use of Virgilian language) to Greco-Roman goddesses and prophets.

Because historical information about Proba is limited, many scholars have taken to analyzing "De laudibus Christi" to learn more about her. According to the classicist Bernice Kaczynski, "Scholars have seen traces of Proba's own character in her emphasis on the beauty of the natural world, readily apparent in her account of the creation." The cento suggests that Proba had great regard for "domestic matters, for marriage and the family, for marital devotion and [for] filial piety". While the New Testament stresses <a href="Asceticism%23Christianity">asceticism</a>, Proba seems to de-emphasize its importance, given that topics like virginity and poverty are not stressed in her poem. In regards to issues of finance, Proba reinterprets a number of the New Testament episodes in which Jesus urges his followers to eschew wealth as passages suggesting that Christians should simply share wealth with their families. These changes illustrate Proba's historical context, her socio-economic position, and the expectations of her class.

As to why Proba arranged in the poem in the first place, scholars are still divided. The Latinist R. P. H. Green argues that the work was a reaction to the Roman emperor <a href="Julian%20%28emperor%29">Julian</a>'s law forbidding Christians from teaching literature that they did not believe to be true (which is to say, classical Greek and Latin mythology). Proba's goal, Green writes, was to present Virgil "without [pagan] gods, and [thus] a [Virgil] no longer vulnerable to Christian criticism". In this way, a Christian teacher could use the text to discuss Virgil without compromising their religious and moral integrity. Clark and Hatch, on the other hand, postulate that Jesus's Virgilian nature in the cento may have been Proba's attempt to rebut the unflattering, demonizing descriptions of Jesus in Julian's "Caesares" and "<a href="Against%20the%20Galileans">Contra Galilaeos</a>". They conclude that the hypothesis is intriguing but unverifiable due to the lack of information about Proba, the date of the cento's creation, and her intentions. Finally, the classicist Aurelio Amatucci suggests that Proba composed the cento to teach her children stories from the Bible, although there is no solid evidence that the poem was ever intended to be a teaching tool.

By studying the manuscript records of <a href="Cloister">claustral</a> libraries, scholars have concluded that Proba's cento was heavily copied upon its release. It was evidently very popular in schools, and often used alongside <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a>'s "<a href="De%20doctrina%20Christiana">De doctrina Christiana</a>"; in some instances, Proba's work even eclipsed Augustine's in popularity. According to Cătălina Mărmureanu, Gianina Cernescu, and Laura Lixandru, the work was likely favored because of its accessible, Virgilian style and because Proba presented herself as a "meek" female, thus appealing to the "misogynistic views of the general public".

In the late-4th and early-5th centuries, the work began to receive a more mixed response. Many scholars hold that the <a href="Church%20Father">Church Father</a> <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> was a critic of the work; in a letter written from <a href="Bethlehem">Bethlehem</a> to <a href="Paulinus%20of%20Nola">Paulinus of Nola</a> castigating Virgilian centos, he warned against following an "old chatterbox" ("garrula anus") and those who think of calling "the Christless Maro [i.e. Virgil] a Christian" ("non" ... "Maronem sine Christo possimus dicere Christianum"). According to the historian <a href="James%20Westfall%20Thompson">James Westfall Thompson</a>, Jerome "strongly inveighed against this method of destroying the sense of a pagan author", and that "his love of the classics and his Christian piety were alike offended" by Proba's actions. Conversely, Roman Emperor <a href="Arcadius">Arcadius</a> (who reigned from AD 395–408) received a copy of the poem, and his version has a fifteen-line dedication contending that Proba's work is "Maro changed for the better in sacred meaning" ("Maronem mutatum in melius divino" ... "sensu"). The work was also presented to <a href="List%20of%20Roman%20and%20Byzantine%20Empresses">Empress</a> <a href="Aelia%20Eudocia">Aelia Eudocia</a>, the wife of <a href="List%20of%20Byzantine%20emperors">Byzantine Emperor</a> <a href="Theodosius%20II">Theodosius II</a> (who reigned from AD 408–450).

During <a href="late%20antiquity">late antiquity</a>, a <a href="wiktionary%3Apseudonymous">pseudonymous</a> document known as the "<a href="Decretum%20Gelasianum">Decretum Gelasianum</a>"which was long believed to have been issued by <a href="Pope%20Gelasius%20I">Pope Gelasius I</a> (who held the papacy from AD 492–496)declared "De laudibus Christi" to be <a href="apocryphal">apocryphal</a> and a "reprehensible work of poetry". But almost a century later, <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Seville">Archbishop</a> <a href="Isidore%20of%20Seville">Isidore of Seville</a> (AD 560–636) called Proba the "only woman to be ranked among the men of the church" ("Proba" ... "femina inter viros ecclesiasticos" ... "posita sola"). In regards to "De laudibus Christi", Isidore wrote that "it is not the work which should be admired, but [Proba's] ingenuity" in compiling the poem ("Cuius quidem non miramur studium sed laudamus ingenium").

During the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, Proba and her work were praised as examples of studiousness and scholarship. In a 1385 <a href="Epistolae%20familiares">letter</a> to <a href="Anna%20von%20Schweidnitz">Anna von Schweidnitz</a> (the wife of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> <a href="Charles%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles IV</a>), the <a href="Italian%20people">Italian</a> poet and scholar <a href="Petrarch">Petrarch</a> referenced Proba and her work while discussing female geniuses, and in 1374 the <a href="Renaissance%20humanism">humanist</a> <a href="Giovanni%20Boccaccio">Giovanni Boccaccio</a> included Proba in his biographical collection of historical and mythological women entitled "<a href="De%20mulieribus%20claris">De mulieribus claris</a>". In 1474, the poem was published by the Swiss printer <a href="Michael%20Wenssler">Michael Wenssler</a>, which likely made Proba the first female author to have had her work reproduced by a <a href="printing%20press">printing press</a>. In 1518, Proba's work was once again being used in an educational setting, this time by <a href="John%20Colet">John Colet</a> of <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20School%2C%20London">St Paul's School</a>, who believed that Proba "wrote ... wysdom with clene and chast Latin".

Scholarship in the 19th and early 20th century was more critical of "De laudibus Christi". Some classicists and <a href="philology">philologists</a> of the era cite the work as an example of late antiquity's "poverty of ideas". In 1849, <a href="William%20Smith%20%28lexicographer%29">William Smith</a>'s "<a href="Dictionary%20of%20Greek%20and%20Roman%20Biography%20and%20Mythology">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology</a>" called the poem "trash" worthy of "no praise", and in 1911, P. Lejay of "<a href="The%20Catholic%20Encyclopedia">The Catholic Encyclopedia</a>" wrote that "the action of the poem is constrained and unequal, the manner absurd, [and] the diction frequently either obscure or improper". Despite these rather negative appraisals, contemporary scholars have taken a renewed interest in the poem, and many see it as worthy of study. Cullhed, in particular, considers the work "of considerable historical and cultural importance [for] it belongs to the small number of ancient texts with a female author and stands out as one of our earliest extant Christian Latin poems." The first English-language work dedicated in its entirety to Proba and her poem was the 2015 <a href="monograph">monograph</a>, "Proba the Prophet", written by Cullhed.

The poem is traditionally attributed to Faltonia Betitia Proba largely on the assertion of Isidore, who wrote in his "<a href="Etymologiae">Etymologiae</a>" that "De laudibus Christi" was the product of a woman named Proba who was the wife of a man named Adelphus ("Proba, uxor Adelphi, centonem ex Vergilio" ... "expressit"). But the classicist and <a href="medievalist">medievalist</a> Danuta Shanzer has argued that the poem was not the work of Faltonia Betitia Proba, but rather her granddaughter, <a href="Anicia%20Faltonia%20Proba">Anicia Faltonia Proba</a>, who lived in the late-fourth and early-fifth centuries. Shanzerwho is of the opinion that Faltonia Betitia Proba likely died in AD 351bases much of her assertion on supposed date inconsistencies and <a href="anachronism">anachronism</a>s within the text. For instance, Shanzer points out that lines 13–17 of "De laudibus Christi" strongly resemble lines 20–24 of the poem "Carmen contra paganos", which was written sometime after Faltonia Betitia Proba's death. Shanzer also claims that "De laudibus Christi" alludes to a notable debate about the date of <a href="Easter">Easter</a> that took place in AD 387, thereby suggesting that the poem must date from the latter part of the fourth century. Finally, Shanzer argues that the reference to the war between Magnentius and Constantius in the work's proem precludes the possibility that Faltonia Betitia Proba arranged "De laudibus Christi", due to the fact that the war took place in the same year as her supposed death. Shanzer rounds out her hypothesis by also invoking a textual argument, noting that the author of "De laudibus Christi" is often referred to in later manuscripts by titles that only Anicia Proba would have received, such as "mother of the Anicians" or the "eminent Roman Mistress".

In her 2015 book "Proba the Prophet", Cullhed counters Shanzer's claims, first by noting that there is no definitive evidence that Faltonia Betitia Proba died in AD 351 and that such an assertion remains speculative at best. Cullhed also argues that "there are no 'grounds for determining priority of the poem's opening lines, and that the supposed reference to the AD 387 debate about Easter could have likely referred to an earlier, perhaps less famous dispute. As to the titles found in later manuscripts, Cullhed writes that it is likely that they were erroneously inserted during the Middle Ages by scribes who had understandably confused the two Probas. Cullhed also reasons that if Anicia Proba had written "De laudibus Christi", the <a href="Latin%20literature">Latin poet</a> <a href="Claudian">Claudian</a> would have almost certainly praised her poetic abilities in his AD 395 <a href="panegyric">panegyric</a> celebrating the joint consulship of her sons <a href="Anicius%20Hermogenianus%20Olybrius">Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius</a> and <a href="Anicius%20Probinus">Anicius Probinus</a>. Cullhed concludes: "The evidence for discrediting Isidore's attribution [of Faltonia Betitia Proba as the author of the cento] is not sufficient, and so, I will assume that the cento was written in the mid-fourth century by Faltonia Betitia Proba." Today, the general consensus among classicists and scholars of Latin is that "De laudibus Christi" was indeed written by Faltonia Betitia Proba.

The Boat Races 2016

The 2016 Boat Races (also known as The Cancer Research UK Boat Races for the purposes of sponsorship) took place on 27 March 2016. Held annually, <a href="The%20Boat%20Race">The Boat Race</a> is a <a href="Rowing%20%28sport%29%23Side%20by%20side">side-by-side rowing</a> race between crews from the universities of <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a> along a tidal stretch of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> in south-west London. For the first time in the history of the event, the men's, <a href="Women%27s%20Boat%20Race">women's</a> and both reserves' races were all held on the <a href="Tideway">Tideway</a> on the same day.

Trials for the race took place on the Championship Course in December 2015, and the selected crews took part in several practice races in the build-up to the main event. The weigh-in for the men's and women's races took place on 1 March 2016 with both Cambridge's men and women the heavier crews. Pre-race betting on the men's and women's event had Cambridge's men and Oxford's women as favourites to win.

In the men's reserve race, Cambridge's <a href="Goldie%20%28Cambridge%20University%20Boat%20Club%29">Goldie</a> were beaten by Oxford's Isis by two lengths, their sixth consecutive defeat. In the women's reserve race, Cambridge's Blondie defeated Oxford's Osiris by three lengths, their first victory since the <a href="Women%27s%20Boat%20Race%202011">2011 race</a>. In the women's race, Oxford won easily as Cambridge nearly sank in rough conditions. It was Oxford's fourth consecutive win, and their eighth in nine races. The men's race was won by Cambridge by three lengths, their first victory since the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%202012">2012 race</a>, taking the overall record in the event to 82–79 in their favour.

<a href="The%20Boat%20Race">The Boat Race</a> is a <a href="Rowing%20%28sport%29%23Side%20by%20side">side-by-side rowing</a> competition between the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a> (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues") and the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues"). First held in 1829, the race takes place on the <a href="The%20Championship%20Course">Championship Course</a>, between <a href="Putney">Putney</a> and <a href="Mortlake">Mortlake</a> on the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> in south-west London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide. Oxford went into the 2016 race as champions, having won the <a href="The%20Boat%20Races%202015">2015 race</a> by a margin of six lengths, but Cambridge led overall with 81 victories to Oxford's 79 (excluding the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201877">1877 race</a>, officially a dead heat though claimed as a victory by the Oxford crew).

It was the first time in the history of The Boat Race that all four senior races – the men's, women's, men's reserves' and women's reserves' – were held on the same day and on the same course along the <a href="Tideway">Tideway</a>. Prior to 2015, the women's race, which <a href="Women%27s%20Boat%20Race%201927">first took place in 1927</a>, was usually held at the <a href="Henley%20Boat%20Races">Henley Boat Races</a> along the course; on at least two occasions in the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>, the women competed on the Thames between <a href="Chiswick">Chiswick</a> and <a href="Kew">Kew</a>. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the <a href="The%20Boat%20Races%202015%23Main%20races">2015 race</a> by six and a half lengths, with Cambridge leading 41–29 overall. For the fourth year, the men's race was sponsored by <a href="The%20Bank%20of%20New%20York%20Mellon">BNY Mellon</a> while the women's race was sponsored by BNY Mellon's subsidiary, Newton Investment Management. In January 2016, it was announced that the sponsors would donate the title sponsorship to <a href="Cancer%20Research%20UK">Cancer Research UK</a> and that the event was to be retitled "The Cancer Research UK Boat Races". There is no monetary award for winning the race, as the journalist <a href="Roger%20Alton">Roger Alton</a> notes: "It's the last great amateur event: seven months of pain for no prize money".

On Sunday 27 March, the women's race started at 3:10 p.m. <a href="British%20Summer%20Time">British Summer Time</a>, the women's reserve race (between Oxford's Osiris and Cambridge's Blondie) at 3:25 p.m., the men's reserves' race (between Oxford's Isis and Cambridge's <a href="Goldie%20%28Cambridge%20University%20Boat%20Club%29">Goldie</a>) fifteen minutes later and the men's race a further half-hour after that at 4:10 pm. The men's race was umpired for the fifth time by Simon Harris, who had overseen the inaugural Tideway running of the Women's Boat Race in 2015. He rowed for Cambridge in the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201982">1982</a> and <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201983">1983 races</a> and was most recently umpire for the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%202010">men's race in 2010</a>. Rob Clegg, umpire for the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%202011">2011 race</a> and three-time Oxford Blue, took charge of the women's race. The men's and women's reserves' races were umpired by <a href="Sarah%20Winckless">Sarah Winckless</a> and Judith Packer respectively, Winckless becoming the first ever female official of a men's race.

Although around 250,000 spectators were expected to line the banks of the river, engineering works and poor weather reduced the attendance. The event was broadcast live in the United Kingdom on the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>. Numerous broadcasters worldwide also showed the main races, including <a href="SuperSport%20%28South%20African%20TV%20channel%29">SuperSport</a> across Africa, the <a href="European%20Broadcasting%20Union">EBU</a> across Europe, <a href="SKY%20M%C3%A9xico">SKY México</a> across Central America, <a href="The%20Sports%20Network">TSN</a> in Canada and <a href="Fox%20Sports%20%28Australia%29">Fox Sports</a> in Australia. It was also streamed live on <a href="BBC%20Online">BBC Online</a>.

The Cambridge men's crew coaching team was led by their Chief Coach <a href="Steve%20Trapmore">Steve Trapmore</a>. Trapmore, a gold medal-winning member of the <a href="Rowing%20at%20the%202000%20Summer%20Olympics%23Men%27s%20events">men's eight</a> at the <a href="2000%20Summer%20Olympics">2000 Summer Olympics</a>, was appointed to the post in 2010. He was assisted by Ed Green, the former head coach at <a href="University%20College%20Cork">University College Cork</a> and development coach at <a href="Molesey%20Boat%20Club">Molesey Boat Club</a>. Donald Legget, who rowed for the Light Blues in the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201963">1963</a> and <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201964">1964 races</a> acted as a supporting coach, along with coxing coach Henry Fieldman (who steered Cambridge in the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%202013">2013 race</a>) and the medical officer Simon Owens. Sean Bowden was Chief Coach for Oxford, having been responsible for the senior men's crew since 1997, winning 11 from 16 races. He was a former Great Britain Olympic coach and coached the Light Blues in the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201993">1993</a> and <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201994">1994 Boat Races</a>. His assistant coach was Andy Nelder who has coached the senior boat since 2006.

OUWBC's head coach was Christine Wilson who had been appointed in 2012. She was advised by former Dark Blue Neil Chugani, winning cox in the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201991">1991 race</a>. Cambridge's women were coached by former Goldie coach Rob Baker who was assisted by Paddy Ryan and Nick Acock, along with guest coach Jonathan Conder.

Dates for the trials, where crews are able to simulate the race proper on the Championship Course, were announced in November 2015.
The women's trials took place on The Championship Course on 10 December 2015. The race between the Oxford boats, "Scylla" and "Charybdis" was umpired by Rob Clegg and was described as "phenomenal". After an even start, "Scylla" held a one-length lead by <a href="Craven%20Cottage">Craven Cottage</a>, extending it to two lengths by <a href="Hammersmith%20Bridge">Hammersmith Bridge</a>. A strong head wind caused rough water, and conditions worsened past <a href="Chiswick%20Eyot">Chiswick Eyot</a>. "Charybdis", stroked by OUWBC president Maddy Badcott, began to close the gap and took the lead around the second of the Surrey bends, to win the encounter by three lengths.

CUWBC's trial, "Twickenham" racing against "Tideway", took place in rough water and windy conditions. The race was also umpired by Rob Clegg with both boats getting away together. "Twickenham" took an early lead, and following a steering error in which "Tideway" struck a buoy before Hammersmith Bridge, "Twickenham" were two-and-a-half lengths ahead by Chiswick Eyot and pulled away to win by four lengths.

The men's trials were conducted three days after the women's, on 13 December, also along The Championship Course. The Dark Blues, rowing in "Business" and "Pleasure", were umpired by Simon Harris. "Pleasure" drew away to hold half a length's lead by the top of Putney Embankment, extending it to three-quarters of a length as the crews passed <a href="Harrods%20Furniture%20Depository">Harrods Furniture Depository</a>. Although "Business" made a push to close the gap, "Pleasure" held their lead below <a href="Barnes%20Railway%20Bridge">Barnes Bridge</a> but began to tire. "Business" started to reduce the deficit but too late, as "Pleasure" passed the finishing post half-a-length ahead.

Cambridge's trial boats were named "Fuerte" and "Listo" ("strong" and "clever" in Spanish) with the club's president <a href="Henry%20Hoffstot">Henry Hoffstot</a> occupying the latter's number seven seat. "Fuerte" made the better start but by <a href="Barn%20Elms">Barn Elms</a>, the crews were level. With the umpire having to warn both crews for encroaching into each other's water at Fulham, "Fuerte"s Luke Juckett <a href="catch%20a%20crab">caught a crab</a>, allowing "Listo" to take a small lead. "Fuerte" regained the advantage under Hammersmith Bridge and were a length ahead by Chiswick Eyot. Taking advantage of the clear water, "Fuerte" moved across in front of "Listo", and rowed on to win by four lengths.

Cambridge were considered the favourites by bookmakers to win for the first time since the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%202012">2012 race</a>. Bookmakers considered Oxford's women to be favourites to retain their title for the fifth consecutive year.
CUWBC competed against <a href="Oxford%20Brookes%20University%20Boat%20Club">Oxford Brookes University Boat Club</a> along the Tideway on 31 January in a two-segment race. In inclement weather, Cambridge started from the Surrey side of the river for the first segment, and were quickly behind. By Craven Cottage, Oxford Brookes were one third of a length ahead, but CUWBC drew level by Harrods, and led under Hammersmith Bridge by a length to take victory. Oxford Brookes took Surrey for the second piece, starting at Chiswick Eyot. A close start saw the umpire <a href="John%20Garrett%20%28rower%29">John Garrett</a> warning the crews for encroaching into each other's water, ultimately culminating in a clash under Barnes Bridge as Cambridge were pulling away. A "boat-stopping crab" put pay to any chance of Oxford Brookes recovering the deficit and CUWBC won the second segment by three lengths.

CUWBC took on Molesey Boat Club on 22 February in a race from the Chiswick Steps to the Start post. A good start from the Light Blues saw them almost a length ahead by Chiswick Eyot, and move into a clear water advantage by <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20School%2C%20London">St Paul's School</a>. A further length's advantage was taken by Hammersmith Bridge which was soon extended to two by Harrods and three by the Mile Post. Despite encountering a strong headwind, CUWBC continued to pull away from Molesey and passed the Start line six lengths clear. Six days later, OUWBC competed against Molesey in a three-piece set on the Championship Course. Aggressive steering from the Dark Blues earned them several warnings from the umpire during the first race, and although it was initially close, OUWBC pulled away to hold a length's lead by the Mile Post before passing under Hammersmith Bridge two lengths ahead. The second segment from the Mile Post to Chiswick Eyot featured further clashes between the crews, but Oxford dominated, leading by three lengths at St Paul's boathouses and winning by four lengths. In the third race, Molesey took an early lead but OUWBC recovered before the crews shot Barnes Bridge, finishing the piece two lengths ahead.

The Light Blues faced Oxford Brookes on the Tideway on 30 January, in a two-piece race. Cambridge selected Surrey and were a length down by the Town Buoy. At the first bend in the river by Craven Cottage, Oxford Brookes held a lead of nearly two lengths, but CUBC began to reduce the deficit. By Hammersmith Bridge, the crews were nearly level and despite warnings from the umpire, Cambridge held their aggressive line to pass the finish line at Chiswick Eyot two lengths ahead. In the second race, the crews rowed back from Chiswick Eyot to the Finish Post. Although Oxford Brookes took a narrow lead, the Light Blues were ahead by Chiswick Pier and took clear water advantage to win by more than three lengths. Goldie had lost both races against an alternate Oxford Brookes crew earlier.

On 22 February, it was OUBC's turn to race against Oxford Brookes, in two segments over the Championship Course. After an even start to the first contest, the Dark Blues held a slight advantage heading into the first bend. Oxford Brookes recovered, and were two-thirds of a length ahead as the crews passed below Hammersmith Bridge. OUBC took advantage of a caught blade to move back into contention but the race was ended prematurely as a sailing boat intervened on the course. The Dark Blues took an early lead in the second race, but despite being a length up, failed to take a clear water advantage. Oxford Brookes drew back and by Barnes Bridge held a small lead, one which they capitalised on in the rough water to finally pass the Finish Post two lengths clear of OUBC.

Umpired by <a href="Matthew%20Pinsent">Matthew Pinsent</a>, Oxford raced against <a href="Leander%20Club">Leander</a> on 12 March from Putney Bridge to Chiswick Eyot. Although Leander made the better start, the Dark Blues remained in touch, finishing two seats down. CUBC faced a German under-23 crew in a two-segment race on 15 March, with the Light Blues winning both.

On 24 March, CUBC announced their boat name "Kevin" after Kevin Whyman, cox of the successful <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201996">1996</a> and <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201997">1997 crews</a> who was killed in a solo aircraft display crash at <a href="CarFest">CarFest North</a> in August 2015. OUBC announced their boat name "Daniel" after their former coach <a href="Daniel%20Topolski">Daniel Topolski</a>, who died in February 2015.

The official weigh-in for the crews took place at the <a href="Methodist%20Central%20Hall%20Westminster">Methodist Central Hall Westminster</a> on 1 March 2016.
The Cambridge crew weighed an average of , per rower more than their opponents. Both women's boat club presidents were British. Oxford's 2015 number seven Maddy Badcott was the president of OUWBC for the 2016 race. Her counterpart, Hannah Roberts, rowed in Blondie in 2014 and 2015. The CUWBC crew featured three returning Blues in Daphne Martschenko, Ashton Brown and cox Rosemary Ostfeld. Oxford's crew also contained three participants with Boat Race experience in former Boat Club president Anastasia Chitty, Maddy Badcott and Lauren Kedar. Cambridge's number two, Fiona Macklin, was following her grandfather <a href="David%20Macklin%20%28rower%29">David Macklin</a> who had represented the Light Blues in the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201951">1951 race</a> which required a re-row after Oxford sank.
The Cambridge crew weighed an average of , per rower more than their opponents. Oxford's number four, Joshua Bugajski, was the heaviest man in the race, weighing . It was the first time in the history of the race that both boat club presidents were American. Cambridge's Henry Hoffstot hailed from New York while Oxford's Morgan Gerlak was born in Baltimore. The Dark Blue crew contained a single rower with Boat Race experience in Jamie Cook, a member of the victorious 2015 crew. Four members of the 2015 crew returned for the Light Blues, including cox <a href="Ian%20Middleton">Ian Middleton</a> and president Henry Hoffstot who were earning their third Blues.
In the women's reserves' race, Cambridge's Blondie defeated Oxford's Osiris by three lengths to take their first victory in five years, taking the overall record (since 1968) to 22–20 in their favour. Oxford's Isis beat Goldie in the men's reserves' race by two lengths in a time of 18 minutes 55 seconds. It was their sixth consecutive victory and eighth in nine years, and reduced Cambridge's overall lead in the competition to 29–23.
The women's race was the 71st contest between OUWBC and CUWBC, and started at 3:10 p.m. on 27 March 2016. The overall record in the event before the race stood at 41–29 in Cambridge's favour. Weather conditions were poor, described in "The Daily Telegraph" an hour before the race as "terrible ... hail, thunder, lightning, the works". Although conditions improved by the start time, it was still windy and the river was rough. Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey side of the river. Cambridge made the better start and held a slight lead, but after passing the Mile Post level, OUWBC made a push to hold a half-length lead after five minutes, and were almost clear by Harrods Furniture Depository. Cambridge, two seconds down as the crews passed below Hammersmith Bridge, were forced to take evasive action but kept in touch despite multiple warnings from the umpire. The Light Blues made for the shelter of the shore as the conditions worsened and both boats took on water, while Oxford remained in the rough water, losing some of their advantage. Oxford were eight seconds ahead by Chiswick Steps and tucked into the Middlesex bank while Cambridge remained in the more traditional racing line, taking on a substantial amount of water. At Barnes Bridge, Cambridge began to sink and received advice to pull to the side. The Cambridge cox indicated that she wanted to continue to complete the course and was allowed to do so. Oxford passed the finishing post in 21 minutes 49 seconds, 24 lengths ahead of the Light Blues, taking the overall record to 41–30 in Cambridge's favour.
Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey side of the river. The men's race was the 162nd contest between OUBC and CUBC, and was held at 4:10 p.m on 27 March 2016. Prior to the race, the overall record in the event stood at 81–79 in Cambridge's favour, with one dead heat. Oxford were late for the start and were awarded a "false start", meaning that one more false start from the Dark Blues would result in disqualification. Cambridge edged ahead from the start and were a canopy's length ahead after a minute. After warnings to both crews from the umpire, Cambridge moved away from the Dark Blues and were half a length ahead by the Mile Post and almost clear as the crews passed the Harrods Furniture Depository. Oxford pushed on under Hammersmith Bridge to remain in contention, one second behind. Cambridge moved just clear as the crews hit rough water in Chiswick Reach just below Chiswick Eyot. By the time they passed Chiswick Steps, the Light Blues were over a length clear and five seconds ahead of Oxford. Both crews moved towards the Middlesex side of the river to reduce their exposure to the rough conditions and as they passed under Barnes Bridge, the Light Blues held a nine-second lead. Oxford pushed on to keep in touch, but Cambridge passed the finishing post in 18 minutes 38 seconds, two and a half lengths ahead of Oxford. It was the Light Blues' first victory in four years, ending a run of six wins from eight races for Oxford, and took the overall record in the event to 82–79 in Cambridge's favour.
Cambridge's women's coach Rob Baker said "Our cox did exceptionally well and nearly got us back into the race. Then we sunk." Speaking of Oxford's cox Morgan Baynham-Williams, OUWBC president Badcott noted "we're so lucky to have Morgan – she smashed it today." Badcott went on to describe the conditions as "probably the worst I have experienced on the Tideway". OUBC's coach Sean Bowden said the conditions were "the worst I have ever seen" while Matthew Pinsent referred to them as "absolutely biblical". Hoffstot said he was "humbled" by the victory, his first in three attempts, while his opposite number Gerlak acknowledged that Cambridge had "managed the conditions better."

Olympic medallists <a href="Helen%20Glover%20%28rower%29">Helen Glover</a> and <a href="Heather%20Stanning">Heather Stanning</a> were amongst the presentation committee.

Death of Ms Dhu

Julieka Ivanna Dhu (commonly referred to as Ms Dhu; her first name was generally not used in media reports out of respect for <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20avoidance%20practices%23Avoidance%20of%20naming%20the%20dead">Aboriginal naming customs</a>) was a 22-year-old <a href="Aboriginal%20Australians">Australian Aboriginal</a> woman who died in police custody in <a href="South%20Hedland">South Hedland</a>, <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, in 2014. On 2 August that year, police responded to a report that Dhu's partner had violated an <a href="Injunction%23Australian%20apprehended%20violence%20orders">apprehended violence order</a>. Upon arriving at their address, the officers arrested both Dhu and her partner after realising there was also an outstanding arrest warrant for unpaid fines against Dhu. She was detained in police custody in South Hedland and was ordered to serve four days in custody to clear part of her debt.

While in custody, Dhu complained of pain and was taken to the Hedland Health Campus hospital twice. Medical staff believed her complaints were exaggerated and suspected drug withdrawal. On 4 August, Dhu reported that she could no longer stand. Police officers, who accused her of faking her condition, handcuffed her, carried her to the back of their van and returned her to the hospital; she was pronounced dead shortly after arrival. The official cause of death was an infection due to her partner's breaking of her ribs three months earlier.

An internal police investigation found that 11 officers had either failed to comply with regulations or were otherwise guilty of misconduct. They were given written and verbal warnings. A <a href="coroner">coronial</a> inquest found that she had suffered "unprofessional and inhumane" handling by police and "deficient" treatment from hospital staff. It also established that police and hospital staff had been influenced by preconceived ideas about Aboriginal people. The inquest recommended that the justice system should stop imprisoning people for unpaid fines and introduce a <a href="Custody%20Notification%20Scheme">Custody Notification Scheme</a> (CNS). , a CNS is expected to be operational in the first half of 2019, and <a href="Attorney-General%20of%20Western%20Australia">Attorney-General of Western Australia</a> <a href="John%20Quigley%20%28politician%29">John Quigley</a> has stated he will introduce legislative amendments to cease jailing people for unpaid fines in 2019.

Julieka Ivanna Dhu was born on 26 December 1991 in <a href="Port%20Hedland">Port Hedland</a>, <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> (WA). She was <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Aboriginal</a> and of the <a href="Yamatji">Yamatji</a> people. She lived with her parents until they separated when she was three, after which she was mostly raised by her grandmother in <a href="Geraldton">Geraldton</a>, though her parents remained in regular contact with her. She was described as a "cheerful" child whose only health issue was mild <a href="asthma">asthma</a>. Dhu completed <a href="Year%20Eleven">Year Eleven</a>; according to her family, after leaving school, she seemed to associate "with a bad crowd" and was a "wild child".

In November 2009, when she was 17, police found Dhu sleeping near <a href="Cable%20Beach">Cable Beach</a>; when they woke her she appeared to be intoxicated, swore at them and said "I don't remember anything after taking that <a href="MDMA">eccy</a>". Police arrested her for disorderly conduct and failing to give her name and address, and she was detained in police custody overnight. She was released on bail the next day but failed to appear at her hearing at the Children's Court and was fined $200. The following year, Dhu was involved in two more minor incidents involving police after she moved back to Port Hedland. On one of the occasions, she kicked a female police officer while being arrested for disorderly conduct and was later also charged with obstructing and assaulting police. Dhu was again fined by the courts.

In 2013, at age 21, Dhu began a relationship with a 42-year-old man, Dion Ruffin, who had several children by previous partners and—unknown to Dhu—had criminal convictions for <a href="domestic%20violence">domestic violence</a>. By late December that year, Dhu's mother said her daughter had become withdrawn and had lost weight. Dhu told her mother that she and Ruffin were using <a href="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</a>s and their fortnightly <a href="Centrelink">Centrelink</a> payments were always spent on the drug in a day or two. Around the Easter holidays in 2014, Dhu told her grandmother Ruffin had physically assaulted her. Her grandmother helped Dhu leave Ruffin and paid for the bus journey from Geraldton to <a href="Karratha%2C%20Western%20Australia">Karratha</a>, where they had relatives. Ruffin discovered where Dhu had sought refuge and after several weeks persuaded her to return to him. They lived together in a rented house in <a href="South%20Hedland%2C%20Western%20Australia">South Hedland</a>. In July 2014, Dhu told her father Ruffin had broken her ribs. Ruffin subsequently admitted to the assault, saying he struck her after she had stabbed him in the leg with a pair of scissors.

In 1991, the <a href="Royal%20Commission%20into%20Aboriginal%20Deaths%20in%20Custody">Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody</a> report was released. One of its 339 recommendations was an end to issuing arrest warrants for unpaid fines, and another was the implementation of <a href="Custody%20Notification%20Scheme">Custody Notification Scheme</a>s (CNS) in all Australian states and territories. At the time of Dhu's death, <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> (NSW) and the <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Australian Capital Territory</a> (ACT) were the only state and territory to have implemented a CNS. The CNS consists of a 24-hour legal advice and support telephone hotline for any Aboriginal person taken into custody, connecting them with lawyers from the <a href="Aboriginal%20Legal%20Service">Aboriginal Legal Service</a>. , no Aboriginal person had died in custody in NSW or the ACT since the scheme was implemented.

Western Australia has the highest rate of incarceration for unpaid fines of any Australian state. Every year between 2010 and 2014, more than 1,000 people were sent to prison in WA for unpaid fines, and one third of imprisoned women were there for that reason. , one sixth of imprisoned Aboriginal people were there for unpaid fines; the number increased from 33 to 223 between 2008 and 2013. In 2015, then <a href="Premier%20of%20Western%20Australia">Premier of Western Australia</a> <a href="Colin%20Barnett">Colin Barnett</a> acknowledged that the actual number of people incarcerated for unpaid fines is unknown but higher than official records show, as government statistics only count people being sent to prisons, and not those sent to police lockup cells for shorter periods. Between mid-2006 and mid-2016, 73% of female fine defaulters in Western Australia were unemployed, and 64% were Indigenous. WA is the only Australian state that still imprisons people for unpaid fines; NSW was the first state to abandon the practice following a death in custody in 1987. Being jailed for unpaid fines in WA will result in a criminal record, whereas in all other Australian states and territories it is considered a civil matter. WA police do not have the discretion to ignore arrest warrants for unpaid fines under any circumstances.

On 2 August 2014, police received a telephone call informing them Ruffin had violated the terms of an <a href="Injunction%23Australian%20apprehended%20violence%20orders">apprehended violence order</a>; at the later inquest into her death, nobody gave evidence about the caller's identity. Three months earlier, a warrant for her arrest for the unpaid fines relating to her three arrests when she was a teenager had been issued. When police arrived at their home and spoke to the pair, they discovered the outstanding arrest warrant for Dhu. Both were arrested and placed in adjoining cells in the <a href="South%20Hedland">South Hedland</a> police station. Dhu's fines totaled $3,622, and she was ordered to serve four days in custody to repay part of the debt at the standard rate of $250 per day. , Ruffin was in prison for violating the apprehended violence order, burglary, assault and criminal damage. The Western Australia Prisoners' Review Board revoked his bail, saying he was "a lethal threat to the community".

Dhu complained of pain soon after her arrest. When police asked Dhu why she was in pain, she was vague with her answers; Ruffin was sitting nearby when she was questioned. Police officers gave her two <a href="paracetemol">paracetemol</a> tablets and took her to the Hedland Health Campus at 8 pm that night. After a brief examination, she was given a <a href="triage">triage</a> score of four; the second-lowest level of urgency. Dr. Annie Lang, who assessed Dhu, later told the inquest she believed Dhu's pain was genuine but that she was exaggerating her condition. She gave Dhu <a href="endone">endone</a> and <a href="diazepam">diazepam</a>, and declared her well enough to return to police custody. Dhu was returned to her cell shortly thereafter.

Over the next 20 hours, witnesses saw Dhu crying, calling for help, vomiting and asking to return to the hospital. <a href="Closed-circuit%20television">CCTV</a> footage shows Dhu being asked to rate her pain out of ten and replying "ten". When Sergeant Rick Bond went on duty as the senior officer on 3 August, he was told of Dhu's condition and telephoned her father to ask him whether he could pay Dhu's fines so she could be released. Dhu's father told Bond he did not have that much money and also told him Dhu was a user of methamphetamine. Bond later told the inquest he formed the opinion that Dhu was faking her condition so she would be removed from her cell; he informed other officers of his opinion. Late that afternoon, police took Dhu, who was handcuffed, back to the Health Campus. Medical staff notes said Dhu was "Crying in pain ... <a href="Tachycardia">tachycardic</a>, grunting, dehydrated and had a pulse rate of 126 beats a minute". They did not take her temperature because they had a shortage of thermometers. Triage nurse Alyce Heatherington told police "this could be withdrawal from drugs". Dr. Vafa Naderi, who had witnessed Dhu attending the Health Campus the previous night, performed an ultrasound examination on her chest then discharged her with a paracetamol tablet and declared her well enough to return to police custody. His notes from that night say "behavioural issues" and "drugs?". CCTV footage taken when police returned Dhu to the station showed a police officer saying, "Paracetamol? Paracetamol, after all that?". CCTV footage also showed Bond took another person held in police custody to Dhu's cell, told them to look at Dhu and said "This is what happens, you end up like this woman here. It's a good deterrent not to take drugs."

Dhu asked to go to the hospital again on the morning of 4 August, telling officers she was no longer able to stand. Officer Shelly Burgess, who had just arrived on shift, stated that Sgt. Bond told her Dhu was a "junkie" that was "full of shit" and "faking" her illness. Burgess said she accepted his assertion as "his word was law" and he had a reputation for "verbally attacking" people who questioned him. She testified that Bond whispered in Dhu's ear, "You're a fucking junkie and you've been to hospital twice before and this is not fucking on". Bond said he had not told Dhu she was a junkie, though said he may have used the term when talking about her to other officers. He said he had told her, "This is the last fucking time you're going to hospital" after agreeing for her to be returned there. CCTV footage showed Burgess forcing Dhu into a sitting position from the floor. After letting go of her arm, Dhu slumped back down and hit her head on the concrete. Burgess told the inquest that Dhu had slipped. At 12:30 pm, Bond sent Dhu to the hospital for the third time. Burgess and Constable Christopher Matier handcuffed Dhu and carried her to the back of a police van; CCTV footage captured her moaning in pain and Matier saying "Oh shut up". Upon arrival at the Health Campus, Matier told a nurse "She's just putting it on; she's faking it"; nursing staff responded by saying she had actually had a heart attack. A team of medical staff attempted to resuscitate Dhu; Matier continued to inform them that she was faking her condition while they were making their resuscitation attempt. Fifty-three minutes after arriving at the hospital, Dhu was declared dead. Her death marked roughly 340 Aboriginal deaths in custody since the conclusion of the 1991 <a href="Royal%20Commission%20into%20Aboriginal%20Deaths%20in%20Custody">Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody</a>.

In October 2014, after more details of her time in custody had been made public, Dhu's family asked for a coroner's inquest into her death. They also called for the end of imprisonment for unpaid fines, the introduction of a CNS, 24-hour medical coverage and independent oversight at all police stations, "and justice reinvestment into communities, not prisons". These calls were supported by <a href="Greens%20Western%20Australia">Greens party</a> MP <a href="Robin%20Chapple">Robin Chapple</a>. At that time, the <a href="government%20of%20Western%20Australia">government of Western Australia</a> and WA police were still said to be investigating the matter; a report was being prepared for the coroner. Premier Barnett expressed his sympathy for Dhu's family at a Perth rally in late 2014, and promised to make sure that "the full truth will come out", but insisted the inquest they were calling for would not be necessary. In February 2016, an anonymous activist group called 'allies of Ms Dhu' began projecting images of Dhu and her family on buildings in Perth to raise awareness over her death and the upcoming inquest. On the first anniversary of her death, multiple protests were held around Australia demanding an investigation. Dhu's death and her family's activism attracted national media attention, something that is rare for <a href="Indigenous%20deaths%20in%20custody">Indigenous deaths in custody</a>.

The inquest began in November 2015. Members of the public were warned that anyone wearing a T-shirt bearing the words "Justice for Julieka" would be denied entry. Two women wearing shirts that read "Indigenous Rights Defender" were not allowed to enter. On the first day, the inquest heard that Dhu's cause of death was <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and <a href="sepsis">sepsis</a> resulting from broken ribs caused by Ruffin three months prior. CCTV footage of Dhu in police custody was also shown. Members of Dhu's family, medical staff involved in her treatments and 10 police officers were interviewed as part of the inquest. Dhu's mother testified that she twice telephoned the police station asking to speak to Dhu while she was in custody, but was refused permission. Human rights lawyer <a href="George%20Newhouse">George Newhouse</a> represented the <a href="Deaths%20In%20Custody%20Watch%20Committee%20%28WA%29%20Inc">Deaths In Custody Watch Committee (WA) Inc</a> (DICWC WA) at the inquest. In the days after the inquest began, Dhu's family were subjected to a "flood" of online comments, suggesting that Dhu got what she deserved as she was a criminal.

Police and medical staff consistently testified they thought Dhu had been faking her illness; Burgess said she thought Dhu had pretended to faint to get quicker treatment. The inquest heard that 11 police officers had received disciplinary notices for failing to follow correct procedure and that an internal police investigation found four of them had "engaged in unprofessional conduct" and their handling of the situation was "without any sense of urgency ... [they] failed to comprehend and respond to the seriousness of the situation". Burgess received the severest disciplinary action of the eleven; a warning notice from the assistant commissioner for the "lack of urgency" she displayed after Dhu hit her head on the concrete. Three other officers were given written warnings and seven received verbal warnings. None of the warnings resulted in immediate disciplinary action; they only affected the officers' chance of promotion. Most of the police officers told the inquest that at the time they did not understand the notices or the reasons they had been given them. Two of the officers who received warnings had since been promoted; Sgt. Bond had quit the police force, telling the inquest he had done so for "family reasons". When asked if he treated Dhu inhumanely, Bond responded, "I wouldn't say inhumane. I would say unprofessional." A medical expert testified that if Dhu's condition had been correctly diagnosed on her second visit to hospital, her life could have been saved. Sandra Thompson, Professor of Rural Health at the <a href="University%20of%20Western%20Australia">University of Western Australia</a>, told the inquest that if Dhu had been a white middle-class person, "there would have been much more effort made to understand what was going on with that person's pain. So that's what institutional racism represents." Senior medical officer Ganesan Sakarapani said the Hedland Health Campus did not have a culture of <a href="institutionalised%20racism">institutionalised racism</a> and rejected a suggestion that if Dhu had been white, she would have been treated differently.

The findings of the inquest by State Coroner <a href="Rosalinda%20Fogliani">Rosalinda Fogliani</a> were delivered on 16 December 2016. Fogliani found that police had subjected Dhu to "unprofessional and inhumane" treatment that was "well below the standards that should ordinarily be expected". She stated Dhu's treatment at her second hospital visit was "deficient", that both police and hospital staff had been influenced by preconceived ideas about Aboriginals, and that the decision to handcuff Dhu when she was nearly unconscious was "shameful". While the inquest was still open, Fogliani declined requests to release the footage of Dhu in custody, saying that Dhu's privacy outweighed the public interest. The refusal resulted in a backlash from Dhu's family and Aboriginal rights groups, who argued the refusal amounted to a "cover up" of racism. A social media campaign, using the <a href="Hashtag%20activism">hashtag</a> #releasethecctv, called for the footage to be released. Upon delivering the inquest's findings, Fogliani ordered that the footage be made public, with the exception of her third hospital visit. Fogliani did not recommend any criminal prosecutions against police or hospital staff, though did recommend the cessation of the practice of jailing people for unpaid fines and the introduction of a mandatory CNS.

Dhu's family were unhappy with the result as the inquest did not hold any person accountable for her death, and told media they intended to pursue further legal action. WA Police Commissioner <a href="Karl%20O%27Callaghan">Karl O'Callaghan</a> said he accepted that the police force had failed to provide for Dhu's safety, welfare and dignity. Dennis Eggington, the chief executive of the <a href="Aboriginal%20Legal%20Service%20of%20Western%20Australia">Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia</a> (ALSWA), said the coroner's recommendations were "fine" but they had come too late. Upon receiving a copy of the inquest, Premier Barnett indicated that he would not be implementing either of its recommendations.

Shortly after the release of the inquest, singer <a href="Felix%20Riebl">Felix Riebl</a> composed a tribute song titled "Ms Dhu", and released an accompanying music video criticising the police and the government over her death. Images of Dhu and footage of her treatment by police has circulated online in association with the <a href="Black%20Lives%20Matter">Black Lives Matter</a>, <a href="SayHerName">SayHerName</a> and <a href="Idle%20No%20More">Idle No More</a> movements, which was credited with creating solidarity between Aboriginal campaigns for justice and North American and global movements.

An article in the journal "<a href="Social%20%26amp%3B%20Legal%20Studies">Social & Legal Studies</a>" argued that Dhu's death was inherently linked to "gendered, institutional and structural racism" endemic to Australia, and that the coroner showed little consideration for this and instead attributed the death to a series of "individual failures". The article noted the inquest's finding that the only person who treated Dhu with dignity was the most inexperienced officer involved, and argued that this was because that officer had had the least amount of exposure to the culture of the WA police force. An article in the journal "<a href="Settler%20Colonial%20Studies">Settler Colonial Studies</a>" reached similar conclusions, arguing that the inquest was "a performative attempt in the maintenance of [Australia's colonial] conquest", which was "incapable of addressing the foundations of Ms. Dhu's suffering: colonial patriarchy and dispossession, in the form of the settler carceral state".

In June 2015, in direct response to Dhu's death, the WA state government announced that police detention would be made safer and that efforts would be made to keep some low-level offenders and youth offenders out of custody. It did not clarify whether this would include people who had unpaid fines. ALSWA welcomed the announcement but said it needed to be backed up with action. Dhu's grandmother said the proposed changes did not address all of her concerns, though they were a good start. <a href="Joe%20Francis%20%28politician%29">Joe Francis</a>, then <a href="Minister%20for%20Corrective%20Services%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Minister for Corrective Services</a>, opposed any plans to end jailing people for unpaid fines; earlier that year he had called for even harsher penalties for fine defaulters, including longer prison sentences. Marc Newhouse, chairman of the DICWC WA, said Francis' proposal made government promises to reduce the incarceration rate for Aboriginals "look like a lie", and University of Western Australia criminologist Dr Hilde Tubex said such a proposal would negatively impact on indigenous people, women and those affected by poverty.

In May 2016, a report by Neil Morgan, Inspector of Custodial Services, recommended that WA stop jailing people for unpaid fines. His report mentioned the Dhu case. In October 2016 <a href="Nigel%20Scullion">Nigel Scullion</a>, the federal <a href="Minister%20for%20Indigenous%20Affairs%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Indigenous Affairs</a>, offered to fund the first three years of implementation for any state that legislated a CNS. The WA state government rejected the offer. In March 2017, just prior to <a href="Western%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%202017">the 2017 state election</a>, Dhu's family criticised both of the major political parties in WA for not supporting such a scheme. The incumbent <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia%20%28Western%20Australian%20Division%29">Liberal Party</a> voiced their opposition to the program while the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20%28Western%20Australian%20Branch%29">Labor Party</a> said they would consider the scheme but made no commitments. The Labor Party voiced its support for the end of the jailing of people for unpaid fines.

In September 2017, Dhu's family were awarded $1.1 million <a href="ex%20gratia">ex gratia</a> and received a formal apology from the WA state government. The payment does not prevent Dhu's family from taking further legal action, and was separate from a civil suit lodged in the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Western%20Australia">Supreme Court of Western Australia</a> in July 2017 by them. Dhu's grandmother said she was surprised by the payment and apology, though she would have rather seen people held accountable for Dhu's death. <a href="Attorney-General%20of%20Western%20Australia">Attorney-General of Western Australia</a> <a href="John%20Quigley%20%28politician%29">John Quigley</a>, who announced the payment, also reaffirmed his intention to implement a mandatory CNS. In October 2017, the <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">Australian federal government</a> was reported to be urging the other states and territories to implement a CNS. John Quigley supported such a program, saying "I think it [is] life-saving legislation. I'm sure if they took the late Ms Dhu into custody ... if the Aboriginal Legal Service [had] been contacted on day one it would have been a very different outcome". An online petition calling for the scheme was signed by almost 20,000 people in less than one week.

On 7 May 2018, Dhu's cousin Alira Kelly-Ryder was informed a warrant for her arrest for unpaid fines totaling $3,744 had been issued. Kelly-Ryder had been making regular repayments on the fines but was unable to continue doing so after she became unemployed when her work contract as a <a href="liaison%20officer">liaison officer</a> at <a href="Banksia%20Hill%20Juvenile%20Detention%20Centre">Banksia Hill Juvenile Detention Centre</a> was not renewed. After her story was aired on <a href="National%20Indigenous%20Television">National Indigenous Television</a>, a <a href="crowdsourcing">crowdsourcing</a> campaign raised the money to pay the fines. Kelly-Ryder telephoned the Western Australian Fines Enforcement Agency later that week and offered to pay the debt, and was informed the warrant had been withdrawn. Kelly-Ryder believed the publicity surrounding her case caused the withdrawal, though she asked "what about everybody else in my position; are you going to withdraw their [arrest warrants]?". At the time, a reform proposal to end jailing people for unpaid fines was expected to be introduced in the WA state parliament later in 2018. In October 2018, John Quigley said he would introduce legislative amendments regarding unpaid fines in 2019.

On 21 May, it was announced that the WA state government had reconsidered the offer from the federal government to fund a CNS, and that the service would be operational by the end of 2018. ALSWA will operate the service. In late August, it was reported the service could not be enacted as ALSWA did not have adequate funding to operate it. Negotiations for funding were ongoing, with John Quigley saying he hoped the service would be operational soon. In November 2018, it was announced the service would be operational in the first half of 2019. The service will cost $952,000 per year, with the Federal Government and State Government contributing $750,000 and $202,000 respectively. ALSWA will employ five lawyers and two support staff to run the service.

Arch of Remembrance

The Arch of Remembrance is a <a href="World%20War%20I%20memorials">First World War memorial</a> designed by <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a> and located in <a href="Victoria%20Park%2C%20Leicester">Victoria Park</a>, <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a>, in the East Midlands of England. Leicester's industry contributed significantly to the British war effort. A temporary war memorial was erected in 1917 and a committee was formed in 1919 to propose a permanent memorial. The committee resolved to appoint Lutyens as architect and to site the memorial in Victoria Park. Lutyens' first proposal was accepted by the committee but was scaled back and eventually cancelled due to a shortage of funds. The committee then asked Lutyens to design a <a href="memorial%20arch">memorial arch</a>, which he presented to a public meeting in 1923.

The memorial is a single <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a> arch with four legs (a <a href="tetrapylon">tetrapylon</a> or qadrifrons), 69 feet, 4¼ inches (approximately 21 metres) tall. The legs form four arched openings, two large ( tall) on the main axis, oriented north-west to south-east, and two small ( tall) on the sides. At the top of the structure is a large dome, set back from the edge. The main arches are aligned so that the sun shines through them at sunrise on 11 November (<a href="Armistice%20Day">Armistice Day</a>). The inside of the arch has a decorative <a href="coffer">coffer</a>ed ceiling and the legs support painted stone flags which represent each of the British armed forces and the <a href="Merchant%20Navy%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Merchant Navy</a>. The arch is surrounded by decorative iron railings and complemented by the later addition of a set of gates at the University Road entrance to the park and a pair of gates and lodges at the London Road entrance—the war memorial is at the intersection of the paths leading from the two entrances.

With a large budget devoted entirely to the structure, the result is one of Lutyens' largest and most imposing war memorials. It dominates Victoria Park and the surrounding area and can be seen from the main southward routes out of the city (though building work in the intervening years has reduced the area from which it is visible). The memorial was unveiled on 4 July 1925 by two local widows in front of a large crowd, including Lutyens. It cost £27,000, though the committee was left with a funding shortfall of £5,500 which several members of the committee made up from their own pockets; the committee was sharply criticised in the local press for their handling of the campaign. The arch is a grade I <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> and, since 2015, has been part of a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials.

In the aftermath of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>, described by <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> as "the leading English architect of his generation". Lutyens established his reputation designing <a href="country%20house">country house</a>s for wealthy clients, but the war had a profound effect on him; following it, he devoted much of his time to memorialising its casualties. He became renowned for his commemorative works through his design for <a href="the%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">the Cenotaph</a> on <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a>, which became Britain's national war memorial. This, along with his work for the <a href="Imperial%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Imperial War Graves Commission</a> (IWGC), led to commissions for war memorials across Britain and the empire.

<a href="Victoria%20Park%2C%20Leicester">Victoria Park</a> is a area of open land to the south-east of <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a> city centre. Formerly a racetrack, it was laid out as a public park in the late 19th century. At the beginning of the First World War, five part-time <a href="Territorial%20Force">Territorial Force</a> units were based in Leicester, along with elements of the regular <a href="Leicestershire%20Regiment">Leicestershire Regiment</a>. The special reserve battalion of the Leicestershire Regiment was sent to man coastal defences near <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>, while all five territorial units were sent to the front. Among them was the city's former <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> (MP), <a href="Eliot%20Crawshay-Williams">Eliot Crawshay-Williams</a>, who served in the Middle East with the 1st Leicestershire <a href="Royal%20Horse%20Artillery">Royal Horse Artillery</a>. Recruitment to the army was lower in Leicester than in other English industrial towns, partly because of low unemployment in the area—the town's major industries were textile and footwear manufacturing, both of which were necessary for the war effort. Later in the war, many of the town's factories were given over to munitions production; Leicester produced the first batch of <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a> shells by a British company which was not making ammunition before the war. The local authorities held recruiting rallies as the war progressed, aided by <a href="William%20Buckingham">William Buckingham</a>, a local soldier who won the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Neuve%20Chapelle">Battle of Neuve Chapelle</a> in 1915.

Leicester was granted <a href="city%20status%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">city status</a> by King <a href="George%20V">George V</a> in 1919, in recognition of its industries' contribution to the British war effort. The king and <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a> visited Leicester that summer, during which they called at several businesses in the city. In <a href="De%20Montfort%20Hall">De Montfort Hall</a>, the king presented gallantry medals to several servicemen who had yet to receive them, and the lord mayor was knighted, after which the king was honoured with a march past by local soldiers and demobilised veterans in the adjacent Victoria Park. As well as members of the public, the parade was viewed by thousands of disabled veterans, <a href="Voluntary%20Aid%20Detachment">Voluntary Aid Detachment</a> nurses, and war widows and orphans. Such was the size of the force on parade, it took 45 minutes to proceed past the royal pavilion.

A temporary war memorial was placed outside <a href="Leicester%20Town%20Hall">Leicester Town Hall</a> in 1917. A public meeting was held in Leicester on 14 May 1919 (the fighting having ceased with the <a href="armistice%20of%2011%20November%201918">armistice of 11 November 1918</a>), leading to the creation of a War Memorial Committee of 23 members to propose a suitable permanent memorial. The committee was chaired by <a href="Henry%20Manners%2C%208th%20Duke%20of%20Rutland">Henry Manners, 8th Duke of Rutland</a> with Sir Jonathan North (the <a href="lord%20mayor%20of%20Leicester">lord mayor of Leicester</a>) as vice-chair. Two sub-committees were established, one to look after finance and the other to supervise the design. The Duke of Rutland suggested siting the permanent memorial outside the town hall but this was rejected unanimously by <a href="Leicester%20City%20Council">the city council</a> and the committee examined potential sites at <a href="Leicester%20Castle">Leicester Castle</a> and Victoria Park.

A suggestion from a member of the public was examined by the design sub-committee, but in October 1919 the full committee resolved to appoint Lutyens as architect and to build the memorial in Victoria Park, which had been in the ownership of the city council since the 1860s and was laid out as a public park in 1883. Lutyens visited on 20 October 1919 and was accompanied by the duke and other committee members on an inspection of the chosen site. The original plan involved crossing avenues of <a href="lime%20tree">lime tree</a>s to create a <a href="tree%20cathedral">tree cathedral</a>, with a <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a> (identical to the one in London) at the western end, and a <a href="Stone%20of%20Remembrance">Stone of Remembrance</a> at the crossing, within a circular walled enclosure, which would be inscribed with the names of the dead. The paths along the plan of the cathedral would be paved to accentuate the purpose of the structure. This proposal was accepted, and a model was made and displayed in the city museum. By March 1922, the project had been scaled back due to a shortage of funds and lack of public enthusiasm for the project—the costs were estimated at £23,000, of which only around £4,300 had been raised. At a public meeting on 29 March, the committee agreed to abandon the scheme and that "a memorial worthy of the city be erected on the ground near the main entrance gates".

Two days later, the committee asked Lutyens to design a <a href="memorial%20arch">memorial arch</a>. Lutyens advised that such an arch would cost in the region of £25,000; he suggested they consider alternatives, such as an obelisk (which he estimated would be around half the cost) but the committee decided to proceed with the arch despite the cost. They presented the new design to another public meeting in May 1923. Lutyens told the meeting that the arch represented the city's triumphal spirit, and he announced the name "Arch of Remembrance". The name was chosen to avoid the impression that the memorial would be a <a href="triumphal%20arch">triumphal arch</a>, something the committee felt was incompatible with the mood of mourning for the dead.

The new proposal was approved, and construction started on the revised memorial in 1923 and work was completed by 1925. The structure was begun by Nine Elms Stone and Masonry Works, and completed by <a href="Holloway%20Brothers%20%28London%29">Holloway Brothers</a> (who built several other memorials for Lutyens, including <a href="the%20Cenotaph%2C%20Southampton">Southampton Cenotaph</a>). Due to a continuing shortfall of funding, the War Memorial Committee took out a bank loan to pay for the works to be completed. Five committee members served as guarantors.

The memorial, in <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a>, is a square-plan arch with four legs (<a href="pier%20%28architecture%29">pier</a>s; a <a href="tetrapylon">tetrapylon</a> or qadrifrons) which dominates the surrounding level ground. It is 69 feet, 4¼ inches (approximately 21 metres) tall, with large arched openings on the main axis (north-west to south-east), and smaller, lower arches on the north-east and south-west sides. The width, heights and depths of the arches are in simple 2:4:1 proportions: the larger arches are wide, tall and deep; and the smaller arches are wide, tall and deep. Stone wreaths are carved in <a href="relief">relief</a> on the legs at the front (north-west side, facing University Road) and rear of the largest arch; inside these are carved the dates of the First World War: (1914) on the left side, and (1919) on the right. The structure is topped with a dome (attic), stepped back and concave at the front and rear. The city's coat of arms is carved in relief on the rear, surrounded by large <a href="festoon">swags</a>.

The larger arches on the main axis form a <a href="coffer">coffer</a>ed, <a href="barrel%20vault">barrel vault</a> ceiling, crossed by the lower arches to either side. The main axis is aligned so that the sun would have been at its centre at sunrise on <a href="Armistice%20Day">Armistice Day</a>, 11 November (trees and buildings to the south have lowered the apparent horizon since the memorial was built, meaning the sun appears to be slightly off-centre). Four painted stone flags are set inside the archway, raised on <a href="corbel">corbel</a>s on the inside of the legs: the <a href="Union%20Flag">Union Flag</a> (representing the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>) and the flag of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> (the <a href="White%20Ensign">White Ensign</a>) at the front, and the flags of the <a href="Merchant%20Navy%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Merchant Navy</a> (the <a href="Red%20Ensign">Red Ensign</a>), and <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force%20Ensign">Royal Air Force Ensign</a>) at the rear. Painted stone flags are a recurring feature in Lutyens' war memorial designs; he first proposed them for the Cenotaph, where they were rejected in favour of fabric, though they feature on several of his other designs besides Leicester (other examples include <a href="Northampton%20War%20Memorial">Northampton War Memorial</a> and <a href="Rochdale%20Cenotaph">Rochdale Cenotaph</a>).
Above the front arch (facing University Road) is the inscription and on the opposite side (facing the park), from the hymn "<a href="O%20Valiant%20Hearts">O Valiant Hearts</a>". Inscriptions lower down, facing into the park, were added later to display the dates of the Second World War: (1939) and (1945). The side arches also have inscriptions. The north-east arch (left, when viewed from the direction of University Road) reads ; the right (south-west) arch contains an excerpt from <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a>'s poem "<a href="And%20did%20those%20feet%20in%20ancient%20time">And did those feet in ancient time</a>": .

The memorial is encircled by iron railings, which are pierced by four pairs of stone piers supporting gates opposite each arch (the arch was not intended to be passed through and the gates are kept closed). The piers are decorated with <a href="Meander%20%28art%29">meanders</a> (Greek key patterns) and swags and topped by stone urns, similar to the one on Lutyens' <a href="Royal%20Berkshire%20Regiment%20War%20Memorial">Royal Berkshire Regiment War Memorial</a> in <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a>.

Arches are a relatively uncommon form of memorial, particularly for the First World War. Leicester's is one of three by Lutyens and the only one in Britain, the other two being the <a href="Thiepval%20Memorial">Thiepval Memorial</a> on the Somme in France (unveiled in 1932) and the <a href="India%20Gate">India Gate</a> (originally named the All India War Memorial, unveiled in 1931) in <a href="New%20Delhi">New Delhi</a>. The India Gate in particular bears a close resemblance to the Arch of Remembrance, though it is nearly twice its height; Thiepval is a much more complex structure, using multiple interlocking arches to form one, much larger, arch. Lutyens proposed an arch with a dome similar to Leicester's for an IWGC memorial at <a href="Saint-Quentin%2C%20Aisne">Saint-Quentin</a> in France in 1924, though this was later abandoned in favour of the Thiepval Memorial. The three arches that were built and the abandoned proposal all share a strong visual resemblance.

The arch is situated on the highest point of Victoria Park, dominating its surroundings. It is visible for a considerable distance down Lancaster Road (which leads to the park from the city centre), and from London Road (the <a href="A6%20road%20%28England%29">A6</a>) and Welford Road, the two main routes out of Leicester to the south. At the time of the memorial's construction, the area was much more open and the arch would have visible from a greater distance, including from the railway to the south-west. Development in the area through the 20th century, including the buildings of the <a href="University%20of%20Leicester">University of Leicester</a>, now partially obscure the view.

The setting was enhanced when, following the death of his wife in the 1930s, North commissioned Lutyens to design two processional entrances to Victoria Park, leading to the war memorial, as a gift to the city. Lutyens produced a pair of lodges and gates at the Granville Road entrance to Victoria Park, to the north-east of the memorial, and a set of gates and gate piers to the north-west, leading out onto University Road. The lodges are single-storey rectangular <a href="pavilions">pavilions</a> which flank the gates. The external walls are <a href="stucco">stucco</a>ed, giving the effect of <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a>, with <a href="quoin">quoin</a>s at the angles and large <a href="sash%20window">sash window</a>s. Both have <a href="architrave">architrave</a>s above the doorways and a <a href="pulvinated%20frieze">pulvinated frieze</a> below the pyramidal slate roofs and large chimney stacks. The four gate piers are made of ashlar, matching the lodges. They support ornate iron gates which feature an <a href="Overthrow%20%28structure%29">overthrow</a> incorporating Leicester's coat of arms. The gate piers at the University Road entrance are in Portland stone, matching the memorial, decorated with <a href="Tuscan%20order">Tuscan</a> <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>s and topped with an <a href="entablature">entablature</a> and tall <a href="urn">urn</a>s. They support two smaller pedestrian gates, one each side of a central pair. Above the central gates is an overthrow, again featuring the city's coat of arms. A processional way leads from both entrances to the war memorial, where the two paths meet. The long path from the memorial to the University Road gates is known as the Peace Walk (formerly War Memorial Approach) and is lined by shrub borders and formal flower beds.

The Peace Walk was laid out in 2016 as a ceremonial approach to the war memorial from the University Road entrance to Victoria Park.

The arch was unveiled on 4 July 1925 by two local widows, Mrs Elizabeth Butler and Mrs Annie Glover, in front of 30,000 people, including Lutyens and local dignitaries. Eight of Butler's sons served in the army during the war, of whom four were killed in action; Glover lost three sons, along with two nephews and two brothers-in-law. The memorial was dedicated by <a href="Cyril%20Bardsley">Cyril Bardsley</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Peterborough">Bishop of Peterborough</a>, to the 12,000 men from Leicester and Leicestershire killed during the First World War. The total cost of the memorial was £27,000, of which £1,635 was Lutyens' fee and expenses. At the time of the unveiling, only £16,000 had been raised and by the end of 1925, the committee still had a shortfall of £5,500, which the five guarantors repaid to the bank out of their own pockets. The sum spent was similar to that raised for Rochdale Cenotaph, but the committee in Leicester decided to spend the entire sum on a monument (rather than a fund for wounded servicemen or war widows as in Rochdale), with the result that Leicester's is Lutyens' largest war memorial in Britain. It is described by <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> as "the most imposing of Lutyens' English war memorials" and by Lutyens' biographer <a href="Christopher%20Hussey">Christopher Hussey</a> as one of Lutyens' "most spectacular" memorials, "in appearance and setting". Another biographer, Tim Skelton, laments that the memorial could have been yet more impressive had the commissioning process been smoother.

Reporting on the unveiling, the local newspaper, the "Leicester Advertiser" praised the design but stridently criticised the war memorial committee, describing it as a "disgrace" that nearly seven years after the cessation of hostilities we should be touting around to get money to pay for what should have been bought and paid for at least five years ago. It could have been obtained then quite easily, but dilatoriness on the part of those who had control and a lack of tact in dealing with the public caused the whole thing to fall flat. The paper went on to compare the scheme with <a href="Loughborough%20Carillon">the carillon</a> erected as a war memorial in the nearby town of <a href="Loughborough">Loughborough</a>, noting that "Leicester, though some eight times as big as Loughborough, has had a struggle to raise as much money as Loughborough has already spent".

A ceremony is held at the memorial every year on <a href="Remembrance%20Sunday">Remembrance Sunday</a>. In 2017, the memorial was twinned with the India Gate in New Delhi to honour members of the Indian Labour Corps who served in the First World War. As part of the ceremonies, India's <a href="High%20commissioner%20%28Commonwealth%29">high commissioner</a> to Britain laid a wreath at the Arch of Remembrance and Britain's high commissioner to India laid one at the India Gate. In 2018, Leicester City Council commissioned photography of the arch using a drone to reach parts of the memorial that cannot be viewed from the ground.

The arch was designated a grade II* <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> in 1955 and upgraded to grade I in 1996. The gates and gate piers leading to University Road are separately listed at grade II*. Victoria Park itself is listed at grade II on the <a href="Register%20of%20Historic%20Parks%20and%20Gardens">Register of Historic Parks and Gardens</a>. Listed status provides legal protection from demolition or modification; grade II* is applied to "particularly important buildings of more than special interest" and applies to about 5.5% of listed buildings. Grade I is reserved for buildings of "exceptional interest" and applied to only 2.5% of listings. The Arch of Remembrance was one of 44 works included in a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials, designated by <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> in November 2015 as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War.

William McKinley 1896 presidential campaign

<a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201896">In 1896</a>, <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> was elected <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>. McKinley, a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> and former <a href="Governor%20of%20Ohio">Governor of Ohio</a>, defeated the joint <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> and <a href="People%27s%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Populist</a> nominee, <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>, as well as minor-party candidates. McKinley's decisive victory in what is sometimes seen as a <a href="realigning%20election">realigning election</a> ended <a href="Third%20Party%20System">a period</a> of close presidential contests, and ushered in <a href="Fourth%20Party%20System">an era</a> of dominance for the Republican Party.

McKinley was born in 1843 in <a href="Niles%2C%20Ohio">Niles, Ohio</a>. After service as an Army officer in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, he became a lawyer and settled in <a href="Canton%2C%20Ohio">Canton, Ohio</a>. In 1876 he was elected to Congress, and he remained there most of the time until 1890, when he was defeated for re-election in a <a href="gerrymander">gerrymander</a>ed district. By this time he was considered a likely presidential candidate, especially after being elected governor in 1891 and 1893. McKinley had incautiously co-signed the loans of a friend, and demands for repayment were made on him when his friend went bankrupt in the <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a>. Personal insolvency would have removed McKinley as a factor in the 1896 campaign, but he was rescued from this by businessmen who supported him, led by his friend and political manager, <a href="Mark%20Hanna">Mark Hanna</a>. With that obstacle removed, Hanna built McKinley's campaign organization through 1895 and 1896. McKinley refused to deal with the eastern <a href="political%20boss">bosses</a> such as <a href="Thomas%20C.%20Platt">Thomas Platt</a> and <a href="Matthew%20Quay">Matthew Quay</a>, and they tried to block his nomination by encouraging state <a href="favorite%20son">favorite son</a> candidates to run and prevent McKinley from getting a majority of delegate votes at the <a href="1896%20Republican%20National%20Convention">Republican National Convention</a>, which might force him to make deals on <a href="spoils%20system">political patronage</a>. Their efforts were in vain, as the large, efficient McKinley organization swept him to a first ballot victory at the convention, with New Jersey's <a href="Garret%20Hobart">Garret Hobart</a> as his <a href="running%20mate">running mate</a>.

McKinley was a noted <a href="protectionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">protectionist</a>, and was confident of winning an election fought on that question. But it was <a href="free%20silver">free silver</a> that became the issue of the day, with Bryan capturing the Democratic nomination as a foe of the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a>. Hanna raised millions for a campaign of education with trainloads of pamphlets to convince the voters that free silver would be harmful, and once that had its effect, even more were printed on protectionism. McKinley stayed at home in Canton, running a <a href="front%20porch%20campaign">front porch campaign</a> and reaching millions through newspaper coverage of the speeches he gave to organized groups of people. This contrasted with Bryan, who toured the nation by rail in <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201896">his campaign</a>. Supported by the well-to-do, urban dwellers, and prosperous farmers, McKinley won a majority of the popular vote and an easy victory in the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral College</a>. McKinley's systemized approach to gaining the presidency laid the groundwork for modern campaigns, and he forged an electoral coalition that would keep the Republicans in power most of the time until 1932.

<a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> was born in <a href="Niles%2C%20Ohio">Niles, Ohio</a> in 1843. He left college to work as a teacher, and enlisted in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> when the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> broke out in 1861. He served throughout the war, ending it as a <a href="Brevet%20%28military%29%23United%20States">brevet</a> major. Afterwards, he attended <a href="Albany%20Law%20School">Albany Law School</a> in New York state, and was admitted to the bar in Ohio. He settled in <a href="Canton%2C%20Ohio">Canton, Ohio</a>; after practicing law there, he was elected to Congress in <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201876">1876</a>, and except for short periods served there until 1891. In <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201890">1890</a> he was defeated for re-election, but he was <a href="Ohio%20gubernatorial%20elections">elected governor</a> the following year, serving two two-year terms.

In the latter part of the 19th century, Ohio was deemed a crucial battleground state; taking its electoral votes was thought essential for a Republican to win the White House. One way of, hopefully, assuring victory there was to nominate a son of Ohio. Between 1865 and 1929, every Republican president who first gained his office by election (that is, rather than succeeding on the death of his predecessor) was born in Ohio. Deadlocked Republican conventions in 1876, 1880, and 1888 turned to men born in Ohio, and in each case the nominee won the presidency. Thus, any successful Ohio Republican was a plausible president. One of McKinley's rivals among the Ohio contenders was Governor <a href="Joseph%20B.%20Foraker">Joseph B. Foraker</a>, but Foraker's light dimmed when he was defeated for a third two-year term in 1889.

There were strong factional conflicts inside within the Ohio Republican party; one source of bitterness was the <a href="1888%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1888 Republican National Convention</a>. Ohio Republicans had endorsed the state's senior senator, <a href="John%20Sherman">John Sherman</a>, for president. This was Sherman's third attempt at the Republican nomination; among his supporters were Cleveland industrialist <a href="Mark%20Hanna">Mark Hanna</a>, and Governor Foraker, whom Hanna had to that point strongly supported. After repeated balloting, Sherman did not get close to the number of delegate votes needed to nominate, and when rumors swept the convention that the party's 1884 nominee, former Maine senator <a href="James%20G.%20Blaine">James G. Blaine</a>, might enter the race, Foraker expressed willingness to support Blaine. This dealt a serious blow to Sherman's candidacy by showing division in his home state, and the nomination went to former Indiana senator <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a>, who was Ohio-born and went on to be elected. McKinley had received some delegate votes, and his action in refusing to consider a candidacy while pledged to support Sherman impressed Mark Hanna. The industrialist was outraged at Foraker and abandoned him. McKinley and Hanna shared similar political views, including support for a <a href="tariff">tariff</a> to protect and encourage American industry, and in the years following 1888, Hanna became a strong supporter of McKinley.
Revenue from tariffs was then a major source of income for the federal government. There was no federal income tax, and tariff debates were passionate; the 1888 presidential election had them as a major issue. Many Democrats supported a tariff for revenue only—that is, the purpose of tariffs should be to finance government, not to encourage American manufacturers. McKinley disagreed with that and sponsored the <a href="McKinley%20Tariff">McKinley Tariff</a> of 1890. This act, passed by the Republican-dominated Congress, raised rates on imports to protect American industry. McKinley's tariff proved unpopular among many people who had to pay the increased prices, and was seen as a reason not only for his defeat for re-election to Congress in 1890, but also for the Republicans losing control of both House and Senate in that year's midterm elections. Nevertheless, McKinley's defeat did not, in the end, damage his political prospects, as the Democrats were blamed for <a href="gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a> him out of his seat.

Sometime between 1888 and 1890, McKinley decided to run for president, but to have a realistic chance of attaining that goal, he needed to regain office. Foraker's ambition then was the Senate—he planned to challenge Sherman in the legislative election to be held in January 1892—and he agreed to nominate McKinley for governor at the state convention in Columbus. McKinley was elected, and Sherman narrowly turned back Foraker's challenge with considerable help from Hanna.

Harrison had proven unpopular even in his own party, and by the start of 1892, McKinley was talked about as a potential presidential candidate. McKinley's name was not offered in nomination at the <a href="1892%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1892 Republican National Convention</a>, where he served as permanent chairman, but some delegates voted for him anyway, and he finished third behind Harrison (who won a first ballot victory) and Blaine. Hanna had sought support from delegates, but his and McKinley's strategy is uncertain, due to lack of surviving documents. According to Hanna biographer William T. Horner, "McKinley's behavior at the convention supports the idea that he liked the attention but was not ready for a campaign". According to McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan, many delegates "saw in [McKinley] their nominee for 1896".

Harrison was defeated in the November 1892 election by former president <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>, a Democrat, who returned to the White House in March 1893. President Harrison left office proclaiming the nation's prosperity, but in May, amid economic uncertainty that caused many people to convert assets into gold, the stock market crashed, and many firms went bankrupt. The depression that ensued became known as the <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a>. Among those who became insolvent in 1893 was a McKinley friend, Robert Walker. McKinley had co-signed <a href="promissory%20note">promissory note</a>s for Walker, and thought the total to be $17,000. Walker had deceived McKinley, telling the governor that fresh loans were renewals of old ones, and the total indebtedness, for which McKinley had made himself liable, was over $130,000. That sum was beyond McKinley's means, and he planned to resign and earn the money as a lawyer. He was rescued by Hanna and other wealthy supporters, who raised the money to pay the loans. According to McKinley biographer <a href="Kevin%20Phillips%20%28political%20commentator%29">Kevin Phillips</a>, the governor's backers "paid off the cosigned notes so that McKinley—by now, the probable next president—did not need to go back to practicing law".

The public sympathized with McKinley for his financial trouble, and he was easily re-elected as governor in late 1893. At that time, the United States, for all practical purposes, was on the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a>. Many Democrats, and some Republicans, felt that the gold standard limited economic growth, and supported <a href="bimetallism">bimetallism</a>, making silver legal tender, as it had been until the passage of the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Coinage Act of 1873</a>. Doing so would likely be inflationary, permitting holders of silver to deposit bullion at the mints, and receive payment for about twice the silver's 1896 market value. Many farmers, faced with the long decline in agricultural prices that persisted through the first half of the 1890s, felt that bimetallism would expand the <a href="money%20supply">money supply</a> and make it easier to pay their debts. Cleveland was a firm supporter of the gold standard, and believed the massive amounts of silver-backed currency issued pursuant to the <a href="Sherman%20Silver%20Purchase%20Act">Sherman Silver Purchase Act</a> of 1890 had helped crash the economy. In 1893 he forced through the act's repeal, outraging western Democrats such as Nebraska Congressman <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>. The <a href="53rd%20United%20States%20Congress">Democratic Congress</a> in 1894 passed the <a href="Wilson%E2%80%93Gorman%20Tariff%20Act">Wilson–Gorman Tariff</a>, significantly lowering many rates from the McKinley Tariff of 1890. The economy did not improve in 1894, and other Cleveland actions, such as federal intervention to halt the <a href="Pullman%20strike">Pullman strike</a>, further split his party,

The 1894 election campaign saw the Democrats divided, and the electorate further split by the new <a href="People%27s%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">People's Party</a> (or Populists), which had emerged from the agricultural discontent. There were more demands for McKinley to speak than he could possibly fulfill. Campaigning throughout the eastern half of the country on behalf of Republican candidates, and venturing even to New Orleans in the Democratic <a href="Solid%20South">Solid South</a>, McKinley spoke to large, enthusiastic crowds as often as 23 times in a day. According to his biographer Margaret Leech, "McKinley's fervor was irresistible to his audiences. He was better than a spellbinder. He was a vote-getter. The whirlwind campaign of the Governor of Ohio was a sensation of the autumn." The 1894 elections saw the Democrats suffer the greatest losses by a majority party in congressional history, as the Republicans again <a href="United%20States%20elections%2C%201894">took control</a> of both houses.

The outcome of the 1894 elections made it increasingly likely that a Republican would be the next president. At the time, the presidential nominating process started much later than it subsequently would, and McKinley, in quietly organizing his campaign with Hanna's aid in the early months of 1895, was alone among the candidates in acting so early. Other potential Republican candidates were former president Harrison, incoming <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> <a href="Thomas%20Brackett%20Reed">Thomas Brackett Reed</a> of Maine, Iowa Senator <a href="William%20B.%20Allison">William B. Allison</a>, and several state <a href="favorite%20son">favorite son</a>s, such as Illinois Senator <a href="Shelby%20Cullom">Shelby Cullom</a>. If former president Harrison entered the race, he would immediately become a major contender, and uncertainty over his status hung over the race in 1895. At the time, unless there was an incumbent elected Republican president, the nomination was generally not decided until the convention, with state <a href="political%20boss">political boss</a>es and delegates exacting a price for their support. A candidate's efforts to gain the nomination did not begin until shortly before the state delegate conventions in the spring of the election year, where fights over the makeup of the delegation often focused on who would be on it, rather than who delegates would support. McKinley and Hanna decided on a systematic nationwide effort to gain the nomination, employing what onetime presidential adviser <a href="Karl%20Rove">Karl Rove</a>—author of a 2015 book on the 1896 race—called "the first modern primary campaign".

To devote himself full-time to McKinley's presidential campaign, Hanna in 1895 turned over management of his companies to his brother Leonard, and rented a house in <a href="Thomasville%2C%20Georgia">Thomasville, Georgia</a>, expressing a dislike for Cleveland's winters. He was joined there by William and <a href="Ida%20McKinley">Ida McKinley</a> in early 1895. The location was a plausibly nonpolitical vacation spot for McKinley, and also permitted him to meet many southern Republicans, including blacks. Although southern Republicans rarely had local electoral success, they elected a substantial number of delegates to the national convention. McKinley and Hanna hosted many southern Republican leaders in Thomasville, subsidizing those who did not have the money to come, and made many converts. The governor also traveled in the South; in Savannah at the end of March 1895, he became the first presidential hopeful in American history to address an audience of blacks when he spoke at an African American church. By the time he left Thomasville, he had gained the support of the majority of likely southern delegates; Platt wrote mournfully in his autobiography that Hanna "had the South practically solid before some of us awakened".

In giving attention to national affairs, McKinley neglected his home front in Ohio, and when the Republican state convention met in <a href="Zanesville%2C%20Ohio">Zanesville</a> in May 1895, it proved to be controlled by the resurgent Foraker, who sought the Senate seat to be filled by the <a href="Ohio%20General%20Assembly">Ohio General Assembly</a> in January 1896. That convention endorsed McKinley for president and Foraker for Senate, and nominated Foraker supporters for state and party offices, including <a href="Asa%20S.%20Bushnell%20%28Governor%29">Asa Bushnell</a> to succeed McKinley as governor. McKinley realized that it would be risky to have a faction hostile to the presidential candidate within his home state, and sought an alliance, campaigning for Bushnell and for a Republican legislature that would send Foraker to Washington. The voters chose Bushnell and gave the state Republicans a large majority in the legislature. In January 1896, Foraker was overwhelmingly elected (to take office in March 1897), and McKinley gained Foraker's agreement to support him for president, assuring party political peace at home.
During 1895, Hanna journeyed east to meet with the political bosses there, including Pennsylvania Senator <a href="Matthew%20Quay">Matthew Quay</a> and <a href="Thomas%20C.%20Platt">Thomas C. Platt</a> of New York. He returned to report that the bosses were willing to assure McKinley's nomination in exchange for a pledge to give them control over patronage in their states and a promise in writing that Platt would be Treasury Secretary. McKinley was unwilling to deal, seeking a nomination without strings, and Hanna, though noting that this made his task much harder, undertook to get it. McKinley decided on a theme for his nomination campaign, "The People Against the Bosses". With Hanna's aid, McKinley found talented men to run the state organizations, who would in turn find locals to ensure McKinley triumphed at the series of conventions that would elect delegates to the June 1896 Republican convention in St. Louis. Notable among these appointments was <a href="Charles%20G.%20Dawes">Charles G. Dawes</a> in Illinois, a young banker and entrepreneur who had recently moved to Chicago from Nebraska, where he had known Congressman Bryan. In trying to organize Illinois for McKinley, Dawes faced the enmity of the local Republican bosses, who preferred to take a delegation to St. Louis that would support Senator Cullom until the bosses made the right deal.

McKinley left office as governor in January 1896. In February, Harrison made it clear that he would not seek a third nomination. Hanna's operatives immediately organized Harrison's home state of Indiana for McKinley with a haste that the former president privately found unseemly. By early 1896, the Reed and Allison campaigns were beginning to form themselves, but they had little luck in Indiana. McKinley challenged his rivals everywhere except in states, such as Iowa, that he deemed had serious candidates like Senator Allison. The favorite son candidacies of Minnesota Senator <a href="Cushman%20K.%20Davis">Cushman K. Davis</a> and former Nebraska senator <a href="Charles%20F.%20Manderson">Charles F. Manderson</a> fell victim to the McKinley forces, well-financed by Hanna, who took their states away from them. McKinley was disliked by the <a href="American%20Protective%20Association">American Protective Association</a>, an <a href="Anti-Catholicism%20in%20the%20United%20States">anti-Catholic</a> group angered that as governor he had appointed to office members of that faith. Their wide pamphleting caused Hanna to act against falsehoods that his candidate was a Catholic.

According to historian Stanley Jones in his account of the 1896 campaign, "another feature common to the Reed and Allison campaigns was their failure to make headway against the tide which was running toward McKinley. In fact, both campaigns from the moment they were launched were in retreat." In March and April 1896, state conventions in Ohio, Michigan, California, Indiana, and other states elected delegates to the national convention, instructed to vote for McKinley. In New England, McKinley made inroads into Reed's regional support, as New Hampshire proclaimed no preference between the Speaker and McKinley, and the Vermont convention expressed support for McKinley. The Ohioan was not successful everywhere; Iowa remained loyally behind Allison, Morton won a majority of the New York delegation, and the bosses were successful in denying McKinley in <a href="New%20Mexico%20Territory">New Mexico Territory</a> and <a href="Oklahoma%20Territory">Oklahoma Territory</a>. The contest was still undetermined going into the April 29 Illinois state convention, with the McKinley forces led by Dawes against the local bosses. McKinley gained most of Illinois' delegates, giving him a sizable lead, and influencing remaining state conventions to jump on his <a href="bandwagon%20effect">bandwagon</a>.

McKinley remained well ahead when the state conventions concluded, leaving his opponents' only hope the <a href="Republican%20National%20Committee">Republican National Committee</a> (RNC), which would make initial rulings on which delegates would be seated; there were contested seats or rival delegations in several states, and rulings against McKinley could still deprive him of a first-ballot majority. When the RNC met in mid-June, just prior to the convention, McKinley was easily victorious in almost all cases.

The <a href="1896%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1896 Republican National Convention</a> convened at the Wigwam, a temporary structure in St. Louis, on June 16. With most credentials battles settled in McKinley's favor, the roll of delegates drawn up by the RNC heavily favored the Ohioan, though Reed, Allison, Morton and Quay remained in the race. The credentials report served as a test vote, which the McKinley forces won easily. Hanna, who was a delegate from Ohio, was in full control of the convention.
Many westerners, including Republicans, were supporters of free silver. McKinley's advisors had anticipated there would be strong feelings about the currency question, and pressed the candidate for a decision on what the party platform should say on the subject. McKinley had hoped to avoid this issue; his surrogates had presented him as firmly for the gold standard in the East, where support for that policy was strong. Western supporters, who often favored silver, were told he was sympathetic to the bimetallic cause. In the following years, several McKinley associates, including publisher <a href="H.%20H.%20Kohlsaat">H. H. Kohlsaat</a> and Wisconsin's <a href="Henry%20C.%20Payne">Henry C. Payne</a>, took credit for including an explicit mention of the gold standard in the platform's currency plank (for they deemed it vital to the Republican victory in November), but it was not inserted in the draft until Hanna consulted with McKinley by telephone. The silver Republicans from the West were led by Colorado Senator <a href="Henry%20M.%20Teller">Henry M. Teller</a>, who drafted a plank promoting free silver, only to see it voted down in the drafting committee, and in the full Platform Committee. Teller was determined to have the full convention vote on his language, although it was certain he would lose as most Republican delegates favored the gold standard. The debate was held on June 18. After Teller's minority report was voted down and the gold plank adopted by an overwhelming majority, 23 delegates, including Teller and his Senate colleagues <a href="Frank%20J.%20Cannon">Frank Cannon</a> of Utah and <a href="Fred%20Dubois">Fred Dubois</a> of Idaho, walked out of the convention and thus left the Republican Party. Amid a tumultuous scene, an angry Hanna was seen standing on a chair, shouting at the departing men, "Go! Go! Go!"

Although Platt desired a recess, Hanna refused, wanting the convention to complete its work that day, and the delegates proceeded to the presidential nomination. McKinley had insisted that Foraker nominate him to demonstrate the unity of the Ohio Republican Party, and after some reluctance by the senator-elect, who feared blame if anything went wrong, Foraker agreed. McKinley was waiting with family and friends at his house in Canton, being kept up to date by telegraph and telephone. He was able to listen to part of Foraker's speech, and the tremendous reception that met it, over the phone line. McKinley was easily nominated on the first ballot, with Reed his nearest competitor. Canton erupted in celebration, with McKinley making speech after speech to the townsfolk and to those who poured in that day by rail from across Ohio, even from his birthplace of Niles.
This left the question of the vice presidential candidate. McKinley had offered the second place on the ticket to Reed, who had refused it. Platt wanted Morton, who had been vice president under Harrison; the New York governor did not want it, and McKinley did not want him. It was usual at that time for major-party tickets to have one candidate from Ohio or Indiana, and the other from New York, but with that state having supported Morton for the nomination, putting a New Yorker on the ticket would be an unmerited reward. RNC vice chairman <a href="Garret%20Hobart">Garret Hobart</a> was from <a href="Paterson%2C%20New%20Jersey">Paterson, New Jersey</a>, near to New York City. He was a businessman, lawyer, and former state legislator, and was acceptable to Hanna and other Republican backers while being popular among party activists. Several days before the convention, McKinley chose him as running mate, though no announcement was made. At the convention, Hobart expressed surprise in a letter to <a href="Jennie%20Tuttle%20Hobart">his wife</a>, but his selection had been strongly rumored and buttons with his name and McKinley's seen in St. Louis. Delegates ratified the selection of Hobart, nominating him on the first ballot.

In the days after the Republican convention, McKinley remained in Canton. Hanna had been elected chairman of the RNC during the convention; he established campaign headquarters in Chicago, in the electorally-crucial Midwest, appointed an executive committee and began to organize the campaign, which as chairman was his responsibility. McKinley oversaw the activities of Hanna and other key managers, and addressed delegations of workers who came to visit him. He met with Hobart, who came to Canton on a brief visit on June 30, 1896, and who joined his running mate in speaking to a crowd of visitors. In his speeches, McKinley concentrated on tariffs, which he expected to dominate the campaign, and gave short shrift to the currency question. As McKinley awaited his opponent, he privately commented on the nationwide debate over silver, stating to his Canton crony, Judge <a href="William%20R.%20Day">William R. Day</a>, "This money matter is unduly prominent. In thirty days you won't hear anything about it." The future Secretary of State and <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> justice responded: "In my opinion in thirty days you won't hear of anything else."

At the time McKinley was nominated, it was not clear who his Democratic rival would be. Cleveland's opponents within his party had mobilized into an organized effort to take over the Democratic Party and pass a platform supporting free silver. The platform was deemed of highest priority, and only once that fight was won was a candidate for president to be considered. Despite this resolution, several Democrats sought the nomination, with the foremost being former Missouri representative <a href="Richard%20P.%20Bland">Richard P. Bland</a> and former Iowa governor <a href="Horace%20Boies">Horace Boies</a>. Others either seeking or spoken of for the nomination included South Carolina Senator <a href="Benjamin%20Tillman">Benjamin Tillman</a>, Senator <a href="Joseph%20C.%20Blackburn">Joseph C. Blackburn</a> of Kentucky, and former Nebraska representative <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>.
Dawes had known Bryan in Nebraska, and predicted that if the former congressman got to address the convention, he would use his skills as a speaker to stampede it to a nomination. McKinley and Hanna mocked Dawes, telling him that Bland would be the Democratic choice. The <a href="1896%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1896 Democratic National Convention</a> opened in Chicago on July 7, with the silverites in full control; they drafted a platform supporting free silver. The final speaker during the debate on the platform was former congressman Bryan, who with Dawes in the gallery delivered a speech decrying the gold standard that to Democrats, according to Phillips, was "messianic—a call to arms". Dawes deemed his friend's <a href="Cross%20of%20Gold%20speech">Cross of Gold speech</a> magnificent, though with "pitiably weak" logic, but it won Bryan the presidential nomination, and Phillips noted that the address "unnerved Midwestern Republicans, mindful of their own distrust of the East, and threw a weighty stone into the quiet pool of June <a href="Grand%20Old%20Party">GOP</a> electoral assumptions".

When journalist <a href="Murat%20Halstead">Murat Halstead</a> telephoned McKinley from Chicago to inform him that Bryan would be nominated, he responded dismissively and hung up the phone. Bryan's nomination briefly gratified the Republicans, believing that his selection would lead to an easy victory for McKinley. In those days when the presidential campaign did not begin in earnest until September, Hanna had planned a vacation while McKinley anticipated a quiet summer. The Republicans were caught by surprise by the wave of enthusiasm that Bryan's speech and nomination caused, and scuttled these plans; as Hanna wrote to McKinley on July 16, "the Chicago convention has changed everything".

Hanna quickly realized that the currency issue struck an emotional chord in many Americans, and decided on a campaign to persuade the voter that "sound money", the gold standard unless modified by international agreement, was much preferable to bimetallism. Such propaganda would not be cheap, as before the age of television and radio, the most effective way of reaching the electorate was through the written word, and through public speakers who would address meetings on behalf of the candidate. This would take money, and Hanna undertook to secure it from his corporate connections. As Hanna began his fundraising efforts in late July, the Populists met in St. Louis. Faced with splitting the silver vote, they chose to endorse Bryan, beginning their dissolution as a party.

Large sums had to be spent quickly, and Hanna energetically built a businesslike campaign. Bryan's surge contributed to a sense of crisis that enabled Hanna to make peace in his party, eventually uniting all behind McKinley with the exception of some Silver Republicans. But as the campaign began operations, and began them on a huge scale, money was short. Hanna initially spent much of his time in New York, where many financiers were based. He faced resistance at first, both because he was not yet widely known on the national scene, and because some moneymen, although appalled at the Democratic position on the currency issue, felt Bryan was so extreme that McKinley was sure to win. Others were disappointed New York Governor Morton was not the presidential nominee, but their support became warmer as they came to know McKinley and Hanna. Reports of Bryan support in the crucial Midwest, and intervention by Hanna's old schoolmate, <a href="John%20D.%20Rockefeller">John D. Rockefeller</a> (his <a href="Standard%20Oil">Standard Oil</a> gave $250,000), made executives more willing to listen. After a gloomy August for the campaign's fundraising, in September, corporate moguls "opened their purse strings to Hanna". <a href="J.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BP.%20Morgan">J. P. Morgan</a> gave $250,000. Dawes recorded an official figure for fundraising of $3,570,397.13, twice what the Republicans had raised in 1892, and as much as ten times what Bryan may have had to spend. Dawes' figure did not include fundraising by state and local committees, nor in-kind donations such as railroad fare discounts, which were heavily subsidized for Republican political travelers, including the delegations going to see McKinley. Estimates of what Republicans may have raised in total have ranged as high as $16.5 million.

From his house on North Market Street in Canton, McKinley ran his campaign, with telephone and telegraph at his disposal. Hanna was busy meeting with executives to extract funds, and delegated much of the day-to-day policymaking to others, most prominently Dawes, who was a member of the campaign executive committee and was responsible for distributing much of the money that Hanna raised. Payne was nominally in charge of the Chicago office, but Dawes, a member of the McKinley inner circle, had more influence. Pamphlets were sent from Chicago in carload lots across the country. The campaign spent almost $500,000 on printing alone, which Stanley Jones, in his account of the 1896 campaign, estimated paid for hundreds of millions of pamphlets. The campaign paid for hundreds of speakers to stump on McKinley's behalf. Efforts were made to keep expenses down; Dawes insisted on competitive bidding, and most of his top-level hires were business associates, not political operatives. Others prominent in the Chicago office included <a href="Charles%20Dick">Charles Dick</a>, the secretary of the organization and later a senator.

From the moment he was nominated, McKinley was beset by supporters coming to Canton to hail him, hoping to hear him give a political speech. McKinley remained in Canton, available to the public every day but Sunday, continuously from his June nomination until Election Day in November, excepting one trip in July to give previously arranged nonpolitical speeches in Cleveland and at <a href="Mount%20Union%20College">Mount Union College</a>. He also took one weekend of rest in late August. The need to greet and speak to supporters made it difficult for McKinley to get campaign work done; one political club interrupted his conference with Hobart in late June. McKinley complained that his time was not being well managed.

Bryan's announcement, after gaining the Democratic nomination, that he would undertake a nationwide tour by rail, something then unusual for presidential candidates, put pressure on McKinley to match him. Hanna especially urged his candidate to hit the road. McKinley decided against this, feeling that he could not outdo Bryan, who was a brilliant <a href="stump%20speech%20%28politics%29">stump speaker</a>, and that he would be foolish to try. "I might as well put up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete against some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. I have to "think" when I speak." Furthermore, no matter how McKinley traveled, Bryan would upstage him by choosing a less comfortable manner. McKinley was unwilling to compete with Bryan on the Democrat's terms, and sought to find his own way to reach the people.
The <a href="front%20porch%20campaign">front porch campaign</a> that McKinley decided on was a natural extension of the pilgrimages to Canton by McKinley devotees that were already occurring. After a few initial stumbles, things settled into routine by mid-September. While any group could visit McKinley by writing in advance, his campaign arranged for many of them, and they came from towns small and large. If possible, the group's leader was brought to Canton in advance to confer with McKinley on what each would say; if not, the group would be met at the Canton railroad station by a McKinley representative, who would discuss what would be said with the group's leader. There were parades every day in Canton that campaign season, as the groups marched through the <a href="bunting%20%28textile%29">bunting</a>-draped streets, escorted by a mounted troop known as the McKinley Home Guards, who saw to it that groups arrived at the McKinley residence on a prearranged schedule. There, the group leader would deliver his remarks, and McKinley would deliver a reply often prepared in advance. Afterwards, there might be refreshments or the opportunity to shake hands with McKinley, before the delegation was escorted off for their return journey to the railroad station. If it rained, the meetings took place in one of several indoor venues.

Bicycling was the latest craze in the United States in 1896, and among those who came to salute McKinley was a brigade of bicyclists, who pulled images of McKinley and Hobart behind their vehicles, and performed tricks as they went to see their presidential candidate. The people of Canton joined in enthusiastically, and restaurants and souvenir venders expanded their operations. A popular source of keepsakes was the wood of McKinley's front porch or fence, whittled as supporters listened, and the blades of his lawn, when not trampled underfoot, made later appearances in scrapbooks. In between delegations, McKinley entertained visitors; future Secretary of State <a href="John%20Hay">John Hay</a>, a major backer, came to Canton reluctantly, not relishing the crowds, but wrote "he met me at the [railroad] station, gave me meat & took me upstairs and talked for two hours as calmly & serenely as if we were summer boarders in Bethlehem, at a loss for means to kill time. I was more struck than ever with his mask. It is a genuine Italian ecclesiastical face of the XVth Century."

With <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201896">his campaign</a> ill-financed, Bryan was his own greatest asset, and traveled to 27 of the 45 states, logging , and in his estimated 600 speeches reached some 5,000,000 listeners. McKinley did not match those numbers, speaking 300 times to 750,000 visitors, but in remaining at home, he avoided the fatigue of Bryan's exhausting tour. The Republican was better able to provide fresh material for the next day's newspapers without making gaffes; Bryan made several. According to R. Hal Williams in his book on the 1896 campaign, "The Front Porch Campaign was a remarkable success."

Bryan's nomination caused defections and divisions in the Republican party; many farmers in the Midwest, even in McKinley's Ohio, found the inflation it was expected free silver would cause to be attractive, as it would make it easier to repay debts. Polls in battleground midwestern states, and word from activists there, showed that Bryan had made deep inroads into Republican support. One survey in August showed that of the midwestern states, only Wisconsin was safe for the Republicans.
By early in August, the McKinley campaign had decided upon a strategy: appeal to labor and established farmers. McKinley, on the urgent advice of his advisers, by the middle of that month had decided that the currency question must be addressed immediately, and the campaign machine began the process of generating millions of publications and sending hundreds of speakers into the field. The pamphlets contained quotes or articles from McKinley, members of Congress, and financial experts on why a bimetallic standard would be ruinous to the country. <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, then a member of the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Police%20Commissioner">New York City Police Commission</a>, recalled seeing boxcars full of paper being dispatched when he visited the Chicago headquarters in August. For the benefit of those who did not read English, there were pamphlets in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Yiddish, German, Polish, Norwegian, Italian, Danish, and Dutch. Pre-written articles were sent to periodicals, and the campaign paid for friendly newspapers to be sent to thousands of citizens across the country for the duration. Five million families received McKinley campaign materials on a weekly basis. Among the surrogates sent out on McKinley's behalf was newspaper editor <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a>, paid to make speeches across Ohio. The future president made a positive impression and three years later was elected to the <a href="Ohio%20State%20Senate">Ohio State Senate</a>, beginning his political rise.

On his front porch, McKinley urged sound money, though he never ceased to promote protectionism to support American industry. Horner noted, "the campaign effectively linked both gold and protectionism with patriotism." McKinley felt that he could not campaign entirely on the money issue, as many midwestern Republicans who supported silver considered protection the major issue of the campaign, and would stay with the party if it promoted tariffs. These issues were given different emphases sectionally: in the East and South, the money issue was stressed most strongly, while tariffs were given more attention in the Midwest. McKinley had little support in the mining-dominated Rocky Mountain states, where even most Republicans were for silver and Bryan. On the Pacific coast, where there was strong silver sentiment, but where McKinley had some hope of winning, the tariff was made the major issue.

McKinley soothed ruffled feathers of party bigwigs by mail and in person. Though former president Harrison refused to tour, he gave a speech in New York where he railed against free silver, stating, "the first dirty errand that a dirty dollar does is to cheat the workingman". The public was closely following the campaign, and the Republican efforts had their effect. In September, polls showed the midwestern states leaning Republican, though silver-supporting Iowa was still close. McKinley's running mate, Hobart, continued to look after his law practice and business interests, and was apparently a major contributor to the Republican campaign. He helped to run the New York office, gave some speeches from his own front porch in Paterson, and in October went on a short campaign tour of New Jersey, though he was a reluctant public speaker. Hobart was much stronger for the gold standard than was McKinley, and made clear his views in his speeches.
<a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>'s "<a href="New%20York%20Journal">New York Journal</a>" was hostile to McKinley throughout the campaign; prior to the Republican convention, <a href="Alfred%20Henry%20Lewis">Alfred Henry Lewis</a> accused Hanna of acting on behalf of a syndicate, controlling McKinley. During the general election campaign, the Democratic newspapers, especially the papers owned by Hearst, attacked Hanna for his supposed role as McKinley's political master. These articles and cartoons have contributed to a lasting popular belief that McKinley was not his own man, but that he was effectively owned by the corporations, through Hanna. <a href="Homer%20Davenport">Homer Davenport</a>'s cartoons for the Hearst papers were especially effective in molding public opinion about Hanna, who was often depicted as "Dollar Mark", in a suit decorated with dollar signs (a term for which "dollar mark" was a common alternative). McKinley's 1893 personal financial crisis allowed him to be convincingly depicted as a child, helpless in the hands of businessmen and their mere tool in the 1896 campaign. Hearst and the "Journal" gave $41,000 to Bryan's campaign, one of the largest the Democrats received, but that amount was dwarfed by the sums raised by Hanna.

September saw Maine and Vermont go heavily Republican in their state elections, meaning the Northeast was likely safe for McKinley. Early in that month, dissident Democrats, who favored the gold standard and President Cleveland's policies, formed the <a href="National%20Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">National Democratic Party</a>, or Gold Democrats, meeting in Indianapolis. The nomination of Illinois Senator <a href="John%20M.%20Palmer%20%28politician%29">John M. Palmer</a> for president and former Kentucky governor <a href="Simon%20Bolivar%20Buckner">Simon Bolivar Buckner</a> for vice president meant Bryan would have to overcome an electoral split in his party. Hanna applauded the selection, and predicted it would get large numbers of votes. There was no chance Palmer would win the election, and Hanna saw to it that the Gold Democrats were aided with quietly-provided funds.

The Midwest was the crucial battleground, and both parties poured in their resources, with Bryan spending most of his time there, as did Hanna. McKinley and Hanna began to sense that the flood of materials and speakers on the silver question had had their effect in the Midwest. Dawes began to slow the flow of pamphlets against silver, and set loose a flood of material favoring McKinley's tariff policies. Events favored the Republicans: wheat prices rose considerably in the final weeks of the campaign, lessening the enthusiasm of farmers for free silver. The Democrats alleged that Republicans were coercing workers into voting for McKinley on threat of losing their jobs; Hanna denied it, and offered a reward for evidence, that was not claimed. To Bryan's outrage, Hanna called for a "Flag Day" for the final Saturday, October 31, as the campaign again sought to link support for McKinley to patriotism, a theme echoed by the candidate as he addressed his final delegations. Hundreds of thousands marched through the streets of the nation's cities in honor of the flag; New York City saw its largest parade since 1865. Election day was November 3; on its eve Hanna and Dawes predicted overwhelming victory.

Stanley Jones wrote of the 1896 campaign:

Voters cast their ballots on November 3, and that evening gathered in cities and around telegraph offices. In places like New York, the results were projected by <a href="stereopticon">stereopticon</a> onto the sides of newspaper buildings. The election was considered by many to be the most crucial <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201860">since 1860</a>, and large numbers of voters followed the returns all night. McKinley cast his ballot early, going with his brother Abner to the polling place, and met Hanna for lunch. That evening, McKinley sat in his library as the returns came in by telegraph. It was quickly apparent that McKinley was leading, and by midnight he had pencilled the figure "241" on a pad, the number of electoral votes of states that were certain, enough for victory. Hanna wired from Cleveland to Canton, "The feeling here beggars description ... I will not attempt bulletins. You are elected to the highest office of the land by a people who always loved and trusted you."
McKinley won the entire Northeast and Midwest, and broke into the <a href="border%20states%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">border states</a> to win Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and West Virginia. He won North Dakota, and came close in South Dakota, Kansas, and in Bryan's Nebraska. McKinley was also successful in California and Oregon. McKinley won with 7.1 million votes to Bryan's 6.5 million, 51% to 47%. The electoral vote was not as close: 271 for McKinley to 176 for Bryan. McKinley increased the Republican vote by 2,000,000 from Harrison's defeat in 1892, though Bryan also increased the Democratic total.

Bryan had hoped to sweep the rural vote and make inroads on urban labor, but he was not successful. McKinley became the first Republican candidate to win in New York City, and won in its rival city of <a href="History%20of%20Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> as well. He lost only one city with a population of over 45,000 in the Midwest, and won many rural counties in crucial states. Although Bryan won all states south of Kentucky and from Texas east, McKinley won most urban centers there.
Irish immigrants generally remained loyal to the Democratic Party, but McKinley's promises of sound money attracted German-Americans who were appalled by Bryan's inflationary proposals. German-Americans had long been Democratic; efforts by that party to rebut McKinley, including circulating a statement by <a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Bismarck</a> in support of bimetallism, were ineffective. Many Catholics and recent immigrants favored McKinley because of the dislike the American Protective Association had for him.

Karl Rove saw several reasons for McKinley's triumph. McKinley campaigned on big issues, the tariff and sound money. The candidate went after Bryan's strongest issue, silver, arguing that bimetallism would harm Americans and hit the working class hardest. McKinley's theme was that it was morally wrong to debase the currency; he linked his stand for sound money with the tariff and with patriotism, appealing to crucial voter blocs who gave McKinley the biggest victory in a presidential election since <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Grant</a> <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201872">in 1872</a>. He reached out to immigrants and urban factory workers, recognizing their importance in a changing America. And to implement these strategies, McKinley, with Hanna's aid, created a larger, more organized campaign structure than had previously been seen in presidential campaigns.

Jones noted, "The Republican Party, under the skillful leadership of McKinley and Hanna, produced a combination of votes which gave it the victory in 1896 and which promised Republican ascendency for many years in the future." The 1896 presidential race is often considered a <a href="realigning%20election">realigning election</a>, when there is a major shift in voting patterns, upsetting the political balance. McKinley was supported by middle-class and wealthy voters, urban laborers, and prosperous farmers; this coalition would keep the Republicans mostly in power until the 1930s. McKinley's wooing of the Midwest would pay ample dividends in the years to come, as it remained solidly Republican in most years until 1932.

Williams suggested that McKinley's campaign of education of the voter through speakers and literature brought him victory, but with a cost to the close identification between voters and the political parties that was typical in the 19th century. Voter turnout was almost 80 percent in 1896, about average for presidential elections in the late 19th century, but then dropped substantially and remained at lower levels as voters, who once participated in rallies and torchlight processions for candidates, were distracted by radio and by professional sports. Nevertheless, later campaigns tried to recapture the magic of 1896; <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> conducted his own front porch campaign in 1920, even borrowing the flagpole from McKinley's old front yard.

William D. Harpine, studying McKinley's rhetoric during the front porch campaign, argued that McKinley's campaign was in some ways ahead of its time, "even in the age of broadcasting, most candidates for nationwide office embark on a campaign tour. In 1896, long before the advent of broadcasting, McKinley accomplished the same purpose as a modem candidate, and did so without making a campaign tour." The visits of the delegations to the McKinley home in Canton constituted a series of <a href="media%20event">media event</a>s that McKinley used to get his speeches into the newspapers. In speaking from his front porch, McKinley was not principally addressing the delegations, but the many Americans who would not visit Canton, and who would read the speeches in newspapers. Williams agreed, "the remarkable Front Porch Campaign used modern technology to bring 750,000 visitors to his small hometown and dispatched his message nationwide."

Rove, while an advisor to Texas Governor <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> during the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202000">2000 election campaign</a>, often spoke of the parallels he saw between McKinley and his 1896 campaign, and the 2000 election, going so far as to fax copies of books on McKinley. The media took the parallels further than Rove intended, making comparisons between him and Hanna, hinting that Rove controlled Bush like it was said Hanna controlled McKinley. Williams also saw the lasting effect of McKinley's 1896 campaign, "a new approach to campaigning, the educational or merchandising style, continues to mold campaigns today, as does McKinley's focus on message, Hanna's use of money, and Dawes's reliance on efficiency and education ... more than a century later, Americans and their political leaders can still learn from the events of the 1890s, whose lessons echo down the years today."

Harpine saw McKinley's personal touch as key to his successful race:

 "Includes 222,583 votes as the People's nominee."<br>

Van Diemen's Land v Port Phillip, 1851

On 11 and 12 February 1851, teams from <a href="Van%20Diemen%27s%20Land">Van Diemen's Land</a> (now <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>) and <a href="Port%20Phillip%20District">Port Phillip District</a> (now <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>) played the first cricket match between two Australian colonies, recognised in later years as the initial <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> match in Australia. It took place at the Launceston Racecourse, known now as the <a href="NTCA%20Ground">NTCA Ground</a>, in Tasmania. The match was incorporated into celebrations marking the separation of the Port Phillip District from New South Wales in 1851 as the colony of Victoria.

The team representing Port Phillip, generally named "Victoria" in the press, was drawn from the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a>. The Van Diemen's Land team, designated "Tasmania" in newspapers, consisted of players from both <a href="Launceston%2C%20Tasmania">Launceston</a> and <a href="Hobart">Hobart</a>. The visiting team was expected to have an advantage through the use of fast <a href="Roundarm%20bowling">overarm bowling</a>. Cricket in Victoria was also considerably more advanced than in Tasmania, whose bowlers operated <a href="underarm%20bowling">underarm</a>. The match, intended to be played to a finish with no limits on time, took place on a pitch that made batting difficult. As was usual practice at the time, <a href="Over%20%28cricket%29">overs</a> comprised four <a href="Delivery%20%28cricket%29">deliveries</a> and there was no set <a href="Boundary%20%28cricket%29">boundary</a>.

<a href="John%20Marshall%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201796%29">John Marshall</a> was the <a href="Captain%20%28cricket%29">captain</a> of the Van Diemen's Land team and <a href="William%20Philpott">William Philpott</a> led the Port Phillip team, which batted first. The Victorian team found the home bowling difficult to face, on account of its unusually slow pace; in their first innings, they scored 82. Van Diemen's Land replied with 104, assisted by a large number of <a href="Extra%20%28cricket%29">extras</a>. The batsmen coped better than expected with the overarm bowling, although <a href="Thomas%20Antill">Thomas Antill</a> took three wickets in four balls in returning figures of seven wickets for 33 runs. Batting again, the Victorian team scored 57, leaving the Tasmanian team needing 36 to win. When the first day's play ended due to <a href="Playing%20time%20%28cricket%29%23External%20links">bad light</a>, Van Diemen's Land had scored 15 runs and lost six wickets. The next morning, the home team scored the required runs for the loss of one more wicket, recording <a href="Result%20%28cricket%29">a three-wicket victory</a>. The match, which had been keenly anticipated, was a great attraction and was followed closely in the press in Melbourne. Additionally, there were many social events for the visiting team.

Following this match, <a href="Intercolonial%20cricket%20in%20Australia">intercolonial cricket</a> became increasingly widespread; cricket in Australia became more popular and was given a boost when teams of English cricketers began to tour the country, leading to a rapid increase in the playing skill of Australian cricketers.

It is uncertain precisely when and how cricket began to be played in Australia. It may have arrived along with the <a href="First%20Fleet">First Fleet</a> from England but no records document this. Nevertheless, the game grew relatively quickly. The first recorded match in Australia took place in Sydney in 1803 between the military and civilians; according to the journalists <a href="Jim%20Kilburn">Jim Kilburn</a> and Mike Coward, in a review of Australian cricket, the New South Wales governor ordered that equipment for the game should be made in government workshops. Similar early games between the military and civilians took place in Tasmania and Victoria. The vast distances between the colonies initially prevented intercolonial cricket, but clubs quickly came into existence in the population centres and an element of competition soon arose. A combination of the presence of the British military, the attraction of English pastimes that did not require sophisticated venues or practices, and a desire to develop a society similar to that of Britain made cricket an attractive outlet for Australians. By 1832, the "<a href="Sydney%20Gazette">Sydney Gazette</a>" was able to state that "cricket was now the prevailing amusement of the colony and that no gentleman could expect to 'dangle at a lady's apron strings' unless he could boast of his cricket prowess." Matches began to be covered by newspapers, and the sport's popularity spread with the population.

One of the most prestigious clubs in Australia was the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a> (MCC), which was formed in 1838, only three years after the founding of <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. The MCC dominated cricket in Australia for the rest of the century. Although club membership was intended for the social elite, similar to that of leading English clubs at the time, its ability to secure the best cricketers in its teams made it enormously popular with spectators; the intention of the MCC seems to have been to spread cricket's popularity in a similar way to the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a>'s efforts in England.

Cricket was less well-established in <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, then known as <a href="Van%20Diemen%27s%20Land">Van Diemen's Land</a>. Although cricket was probably played soon after the island was settled in 1803, and was reasonably popular by the mid-1810s, the first recorded matches took place only in 1825. There was little organisation or competition; there were few clubs, and none in <a href="Hobart">Hobart</a>, in the south of Tasmania, until 1832, or in <a href="Launceston%2C%20Tasmania">Launceston</a>, in the north, until 1841. Partly, this may have been due to an insistence among Tasmanian clubs that only the social elite could play cricket. The cricket historian <a href="Jack%20Pollard">Jack Pollard</a> suggests that Tasmanian cricket failed to thrive in its early years because of "the strange reluctance of the strong, prestigious clubs in Hobart and Launceston to hire professional players to coach and strengthen their teams". With these main cities apart, it was difficult to establish competitive games; despite an abandoned attempt in 1841, the first match between North and South Tasmania did not take place until 1850. These difficulties prompted Launceston cricketers to seek opponents from the Australian mainland rather than from Hobart.

On 12 January 1850, <a href="William%20Philpott">William Philpott</a>—who was born in England and emigrated to Australia in 1844 before establishing himself as a leading figure at the MCC—proposed at a special MCC meeting that a cricketing challenge be sent to Launceston for a match between teams representing Port Phillip and Van Diemen's Land.

An invitation was sent to the Launceston Cricket Club in February with a view to playing that March. The invitation was accepted but the match was delayed when the acceptance letter was not posted in time to reach the steamer transporting mail. The MCC repeated their invitation later in 1850. While the match was being arranged, legislation passed in the United Kingdom to separate the Port Phillip District, which was to be renamed as Victoria, from the colony of New South Wales. When news of this much anticipated decision reached the colony late in 1850, two weeks of celebrations were arranged in Melbourne to mark independence. The delayed cricket match, now scheduled for February 1851, became part of the general festivities, although formal independence did not come about until later in 1851. Furthermore, the fixture was to be the first Australian intercolonial match and was later considered the first first-class cricket match in Australia.

The Melbourne Club decided that the team should wear red, white and blue colours on their clothing for the game. Although they had a long time to prepare, the MCC had some difficulty in assembling enough men to represent Port Phillip; many potential players were unable to spare the time to travel to Van Diemen's Land. Even as the team prepared to depart, only ten people had been found, and the eleventh, <a href="Duncan%20Cooper%20%28cricketer%29">Duncan Cooper</a>, only joined as they left on the steamer "Shamrock". The eleven Victorian players, accompanied by many acquaintances, both men and women, arrived in Launceston on 9 February. On the evening of their arrival, they attended a dinner at the Cornwall Hotel with 100 paying guests. The following day, the team won a match against Bishopthorpe College. There was little time to practise before the intercolonial game.

The Port Phillip team were favourites before the game began. This was partly owing to their bowlers' use of <a href="Roundarm%20bowling">overarm bowling</a> at pace; by contrast, bowlers in Tasmania preferred <a href="underarm%20bowling">underarm bowling</a> at a time when <a href="roundarm%20bowling">roundarm bowling</a> was permitted in the rest of the world. The match was played at the <a href="NTCA%20Ground">Launceston Racecourse ground</a>, but the state of the ground was such that the umpires were unsure of the best place to pitch the wickets. The Victorian team were dismayed by the state of the pitch, which looked extremely difficult to bat on, and later received an apology from the government of Tasmania.

The team for Van Diemen's Land was drawn from across the island: three players came from Hobart, five from Launceston and three players from other individual clubs.

The match began on 11 February 1851 and was scheduled to be played to a finish irrespective of time. It was well attended, and booths were set up to accommodate spectators. According to Ray Webster in his analysis of all Australian first-class matches, spectators were not charged for admission; the attendance was approximately 1,000 on the first day and 1,500 on the second. In common with all cricket games at the time, each <a href="Over%20%28cricket%29">over</a> consisted of four <a href="Delivery%20%28cricket%29">deliveries</a>. Similarly, there were no boundaries to the pitch, so <a href="Run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> could be scored only by <a href="Scoring%20runs%20in%20cricket">running between wickets</a>, and not by hitting a <a href="Boundary%20%28cricket%29%23Scoring%20runs">boundary</a>. Although the colonies were officially called Van Diemen's Land and Port Phillip at this point, press reports generally referred to the teams as "Tasmania" and "Victoria". The match was closely followed in Melbourne.

<a href="John%20Marshall%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201796%29">John Marshall</a> captained the Tasmanian team, and William Philpott captained the Victorian team. The <a href="toss%20%28cricket%29">toss</a> was won by Marshall, who sent in Victoria to bat. The match started at 11 am.

The Tasmanians, bowling first, used their underarm style; the two bowlers, <a href="William%20Henty">William Henty</a> and <a href="Robert%20McDowall">Robert McDowall</a>, had an unusually slow pace. The Port Phillip <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Opening%20batsmen">opening batsmen</a>, <a href="Duncan%20Cooper%20%28cricketer%29">Duncan Cooper</a> and William Philpott, added 14 runs in 22 minutes before Cooper was <a href="bowled">bowled</a>. A syndicated Tasmanian press report of the match described Philpott as batting "in fine style" before he was caught at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">mid-off</a>. <a href="Thomas%20Ferrier%20Hamilton">Thomas Hamilton</a> and <a href="Charles%20Lister">Charles Lister</a> batted steadily before the former was bowled in the first hour, after which the score was 34 runs for the loss of three wickets. Hamilton was bowled and Lister run out; <a href="Alfred%20Thomson%20%28cricketer%29">Alfred Thomson</a>, who scored one run, was soon bowled to leave the score 42 for five. <a href="Richard%20Philpott">Richard Philpott</a>, the elder brother of Victorian captain William Philpott, made 12 runs to bring the score up to 54, before he too was bowled, and <a href="Thomas%20Antill">Thomas Antill</a> was dismissed for a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a>. <a href="James%20Brodie%20%28Australian%20cricketer%29">James Brodie</a> hit out to score 17 runs, equalling William Philpott as the highest scorer of the innings. He was caught at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">slip</a>. The last two wickets fell cheaply; <a href="Frederick%20Marsden">Frederick Marsden</a> and <a href="Matthew%20Hervey">Matthew Hervey</a> were both bowled, and <a href="Melmoth%20Hall">Melmoth Hall</a> remained <a href="not%20out">not out</a> on six. The Victorian team scored 82 in 26 four-ball overs in 125 minutes. Henty (four wickets at a cost of 52 runs) and McDowall (five for 27) bowled unchanged throughout the innings.

For Tasmania, <a href="Gervase%20Du%20Croz">Gervase Du Croz</a> and Marshall opened the batting to the fast roundarm bowling of Lister and Hamilton. They batted for an hour—described in the press as displaying "brilliant steady batting"—without being dismissed, at which point, with the score at 25, a lunch break was taken. After the interval, they maintained their partnership for another 30 minutes before Antill, who had replaced Hamilton in the bowling attack, bowled Du Croz; he had scored 27 in 93 minutes and the partnership was worth 40 runs. <a href="William%20Field%20%28cricketer%29">William Field</a>, who replaced Du Croz, was bowled by the first ball he faced. The new man, <a href="George%20Maddox%20%28cricketer%29">George Maddox</a>, scored a single from his first ball; Marshall was then caught at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">point</a>, having batted 105 minutes for 13 runs. Antill had taken three wickets in four balls. Maddox was bowled by Antill after scoring one, then Hamilton bowled <a href="George%20Gibson%20%28Tasmania%20cricketer%29">George Gibson</a> for eight. <a href="Walter%20Westbrook">Walter Westbrook</a>, the next man in, survived for forty minutes but struggled to score, only managing three scoring shots in that time before Antill bowled him. Wickets fell steadily: <a href="Charles%20Arthur">Charles Arthur</a>, bowled by Antill, scored one; <a href="John%20Tabart">John Tabart</a>, bowled by Hamilton, scored two, and Henty was bowled by Antill for a duck. The last batsman, McDowall, batted effectively to score eleven runs before he was caught by Antill at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">mid-on</a> off Hamilton's bowling. <a href="Vincent%20Giblin">Vincent Giblin</a> remained <a href="not%20out">not out</a>, having batted for a half-hour for seven runs. The Van Diemen's Land innings ended for 104, a lead of 22 over Port Phillip, after 160 minutes and 32 overs. Antill had taken seven wickets for 33 runs while Hamilton took three for 24. Before the match, the Tasmanians had been expected to struggle against the overarm attack of the Victorians, and Antill had performed effectively; yet the Tasmanians were helped by a large total of 24 <a href="Extra%20%28cricket%29">extras</a> (which included 11 <a href="Bye%20%28cricket%29">byes</a> and eight <a href="no-ball">no-ball</a>s).

Brodie and Hall opened the Port Phillip second innings; they added 12 in ten minutes before Brodie was caught at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">long off</a> by Tabart and was replaced by Hamilton. Hall was dismissed <a href="leg%20before%20wicket">leg before wicket</a> from the bowling of McDowall shortly afterwards for six. Lister was caught off the bowling of Field for three and Henty bowled Thomas for a duck. William Philpott was run out by Tabart for three and Cooper was bowled by Henty for a duck, the fifth man out with the score on 28. Wickets continued to fall, although Hamilton was batting well at the other end. Richard Philpott, who scored just a single, was caught by Westbrook off Henty; Marsden was bowled by McDowall for two and Hervey bowled by Henty for one. Meanwhile, Hamilton had batted for an hour to score 35 runs, the highest individual score of the match; he was last man out, leg before wicket to McDowall to end the innings for 57 runs. The innings had lasted 17 overs and taken 80 minutes. The other batsmen had contributed 21 runs (one bye was scored) between them. Henty took five for 26 and McDowall returned figures of three for 21. Van Diemen's Land required 36 runs to win.

Although it was getting late, both teams were enthusiastic to finish the match that evening and the home team began their second innings at half past five. Giblin and Du Croz opened the batting to Brodie and Antill. By the time play ended for the day, Van Diemen's Land had lost six wickets for 15 runs. Giblin and Du Croz were bowled by Antill, who then had Westbrook caught by Cooper. Field was caught by Thomson off Brodie, Gibson was bowled by Antill and Marshall caught and bowled by the same bowler. Tabart and Arthur batted until the end of the day, when the umpires called off play due to bad light. The "<a href="The%20Examiner%20%28Tasmania%29">Launceston Examiner</a>" stated in its match report: "The excitement was now very great, and neither side confident of victory."

Play resumed at 11 a.m the next day, and Tabart was <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23drop">dropped</a> on his second ball when he mis-hit the ball high into the air. Antill took his fifth wicket of the innings when Hervey caught Arthur without adding to his overnight score. Tabart made several big hits and Van Diemen's Land reached their target without further loss, winning by three wickets. The innings lasted 74 minutes and 13 overs. Antill took six wickets giving away 19 runs, and had match figures of thirteen for 52. The syndicated press report stated that the match was "one of the most exciting contests ever seen", and praised the level of fielding throughout the match. The Tasmanians Marshall, Westbrook and Tabart were specifically praised for their fielding, which drew the crowd's appreciation. The spectators displayed high levels of <a href="sportsmanship">sportsmanship</a> throughout the match; they did not cheer the fall of Port Phillip wickets or celebrate scoring shots from their own team.

Notes

Following the conclusion of the match, the Port Phillip cricketers won further matches at Bishopthorpe College and may have played further games in Tasmania. Social events continued during and after the game; one journalist, <a href="Edmund%20Finn">Edmund Finn</a>, wrote: "From the time of landing to the time of embarking the same spirit continued—dinners, balls, musical parties, picnics and every description of entertainment was got up to give a hearty welcome to the strangers from Port Phillip." On the evening of the first day's play, there was a dinner and ball at the Cornwall Hotel; the day after the match, a public ball organised by the Tasmanian hosts took place at the Cornwall Hotel, where the visiting cricketers were staying. The event—attended by more than 350 people, including the Victorians, many of the supporters that had accompanied them, and many of the leading figures in Launceston society—continued into the very early morning. The Tasmanian and Victorian players, accompanied by the Launceston Brass Band, walked together to the wharf from where the visiting players were to depart. The Port Phillip team returned on the "Shamrock" and reported upon their return that they were "well entertained and well beaten". The Tasmanian bowling—described by the Victorians as "slow and peculiar in character"—was their main explanation for the defeat. One of the umpires from the game, C. J. Weedon, retained a ball used in the match. His family later donated it to the Launceston museum.

Over the following years, the Tasmanian and Victorian teams played several matches. A return match was arranged almost at once. In February 1852, nine Tasmanians travelled to Melbourne and, reinforced by three men from Launceston who were resident in Melbourne, were defeated by the Victoria team by 61 runs at the Melbourne Cricket Club ground. A "deciding game", played two years later at Launceston, was won by Tasmania, but the Victorians only brought eight players and had to use local players to both make up the numbers and to act as the <a href="Scoring%20%28cricket%29">team scorer</a>. The Tasmanians were captained for the final time in first-class cricket by John Marshall, who was 58 years old by this time and had appeared as captain in all three games between the colonies. In early 1858, a Victorian team returned to Tasmania and played two matches, both of which were later recognised as first-class. In one, they defeated a team from Launceston, reinforced by four cricketers from southern Tasmania; they then beat a team from Hobart, composed only of southern Tasmanians. Although both defeats were heavy, the popularity of these games in Tasmania directly led to the formation of a new club, which later became the Southern Tasmanian Cricket Association; it began to organise and develop cricket in Tasmania. Nevertheless, the Victorians were unimpressed by the cricket of the Tasmanians, and their inability to cope with roundarm fast bowling; the teams did not compete against each other regularly for 30 years. Tasmanian cricket remained less developed than that in the rest of Australia until at least the 1880s and failed to keep pace with changes in the game.

Intercolonial cricket gradually spread over the next 20 years. The Victorian team began playing other colonies; their match against New South Wales in Melbourne in 1856 was the first between two mainland colonies. In 1864, a representative Queensland team played New South Wales, although the match was not first-class—Queensland did not play a first-class game until 1893. In 1871, Norwood Cricket Club in Adelaide arranged matches against Melbourne.

The biggest stimulus to the growth of Australian cricket came from England. In 1861–62 and 1863–64, teams of English professional cricketers toured Australia; the latter tour was organised by the Melbourne Club. Neither of the teams played any first-class cricket and all the matches were played "against the odds"—the touring team contained eleven men but played against sides with 22 players. Even so, the games, and the two English teams, were enormously popular despite their superiority, even against the odds—the first team played 12 games, winning 6 and losing 2 with the remainder drawn, and the second team played 16 games, winning 10 and drawing 6. Kilburn and Coward suggest that "the performances of the hardy band of professionals opened Australian eyes and stirred Australian ambitions". Several English players remained in Australia to coach; their influence and the Australian desire to match the English cricketers led to a rapid improvement in the standard of cricket. By 1877, an Australian team was able to defeat an English team with equal odds in what was later recognised as the first <a href="Test%20cricket">Test match</a>.

Now, the match is recognised as the initial first-class match to be played in Australia. At the time, it is likely that the players realised that the game was the first to take place between two Australian colonies, and was therefore a historic occasion. Although there were attempts in Australia to identify first-class matches, no formal definition was applied in Australia until 1947. A meeting of the <a href="International%20Cricket%20Council">International Cricket Conference</a> in 1981 agreed that all intercolonial and interstate matches played in Australia before 1947, including the 1851 match, should retrospectively be considered first-class.

Oxenfree

Oxenfree is a <a href="Supernatural%20fiction">supernatural</a> <a href="Mystery%20fiction">mystery</a> <a href="Graphic%20adventure%20game">graphic adventure</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed and published by <a href="Night%20School%20Studio">Night School Studio</a>. The game was released for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href="OS%20X">OS X</a> and <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> in January 2016. <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="Linux">Linux</a> versions were released later in 2016, followed by <a href="iOS">iOS</a>, <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a>, and <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> versions in 2017. In "Oxenfree", players assume the role of teenage girl Alex on a weekend trip to a local island. After seemingly supernatural events occur, Alex and her friends must unravel the secrets of the island.

The game is Night School Studio's first. Influenced by classic <a href="teen%20film">teen film</a>s and <a href="Coming-of-age%20story">coming-of-age</a> shows, the developers wanted to create a story-driven game without <a href="cutscenes">cutscenes</a>, allowing players to freely roam the environment. "Oxenfree"s visual presentation marries dark, organic, and analog elements with bright, geometric, and digital ones. Musician <a href="scntfc">scntfc</a> composed the game's soundtrack, which features digital music production techniques alongside the use of vintage analog tape recorders and receivers.

"Oxenfree"s release was accompanied by development documentaries, an <a href="alternate%20reality%20game">alternate reality game</a>, and a collector's edition. The game received generally positive reviews on release. Critics praised the presentation and characters, although some reviewers were left wanting more. The game was nominated for multiple awards including "Best Narrative" at <a href="The%20Game%20Awards%202016">The Game Awards 2016</a>.

"Oxenfree" is a graphic adventure played from a <a href="2.5D%232.5D%20platform%20games">2.5D</a> perspective, with three-dimensional characters navigating two-dimensional environments. The player controls Alex, a teenager visiting a local island with a group of friends. After accidentally unleashing a paranormal force on the island, Alex and company must figure out what the force is and how to stop it.

Gameplay is built around the "<a href="walk%20and%20talk">walk and talk</a>" mechanic: instead of dialogue occurring during cutscenes, <a href="speech%20bubbles">speech bubbles</a> appear over Alex's head, giving the player a choice between two or three dialogue options. At the same time, Alex remains free to move around and navigate the game world. Players can select dialogue options at any time during conversations, choosing to wait for other characters to finish, to interrupt, or to remain silent. Certain dialogue options cause a thought bubble with Alex inside it to appear over characters' heads, suggesting that the player's choice had an effect on the characters' relationship.

Objects that can be interacted with in the game world display a small circle next to them. Puzzles in the game are solved by finding the correct frequency on Alex's handheld radio, which can perform actions such as unlocking doors or communicating with ghosts, or by winding up tape recorders at the correct speed. "Oxenfree" does not have any "<a href="game%20over">game over</a>" loss conditions; the player's choices and relationships with the characters determine which of several possible endings the player receives.
Alex (<a href="Erin%20Yvette">Erin Yvette</a>), a teenager, is on the last ferry heading to the fictional Edwards Island for a weekend party. She is accompanied by Ren (Aaron Kuban), her <a href="Cannabis%20culture">stoner</a> friend, and Jonas (Gavin Hammon), her new stepbrother. On the island, Alex and company meet Clarissa (Avital Ash), ex-girlfriend of Alex's deceased brother Michael, and Nona (Brittani Johnson), Clarissa's best friend and Ren's love interest. Ren explains the island was once a military base and that the island's only permanent resident, Maggie Adler, has recently died. After camping on the beach, Alex, Ren, and Jonas explore the nearby caves, where it is rumored certain radio frequencies cause supernatural events. In a small cavern, Alex tunes her radio and unexpectedly forms a <a href="dimensional%20rift">dimensional rift</a>. A voice answers and the teens experience visions before passing out. Jonas and Alex awake in front of a communications tower elsewhere on the island. Ren calls, having passed out in the woods, while Clarissa calls from the decommissioned military fort on the island.

In the woods, Jonas and Alex encounter supernatural events, including Alex's reflection in the water communicating with her, objects moving on their own, and <a href="time%20loop">time loop</a>ing repeatedly. Time corrects when Alex plays a <a href="Reel-to-reel%20audio%20tape%20recording">reel-to-reel tape</a>. They spot Nona, who claims she saw an alternate Jonas and Alex. Alex and Jonas find Ren, but after another time loop, they find him <a href="Spirit%20possession">possessed</a> by a "ghost". Using the radio, Alex creates another rift which returns Ren to normal. Ren and Nona return to the tower.

At the military fort, Alex's reflection appears in a mirror, giving Alex advice. A ghost questions them and possesses Jonas, revealing that the ghosts are the passengers of the submarine USS "Kanaloa", thought lost at sea. Alex creates another rift that revives Jonas. They find Clarissa, but time loops to her jumping to her death before disappearing. Nona, Alex, Jonas, and Ren regroup at Harden Tower. Unable to send a radio transmission off the island, Ren suggests finding the key to Maggie Adler's estate, where she kept a boat. At Adler's estate, a possessed Clarissa talks with Ren; her conversations and scattered letters left behind by Maggie Adler reveal that Adler mistakenly interpreted scrambled messages from "Kanaloa" as an enemy transmission, and the submarine was sunk by friendly fire. The crew was not killed, but transported to another dimension due to the sub's experimental nuclear reactor. Adler and her friend Anna attempted to communicate with the "Kanaloa" crew via a radio, but Anna was absorbed through the rift. The "Kanaloa" crew intend on using Alex and her friends' bodies to escape the dimension, keeping them on the island long enough for their possession attempts to be successful.

Alex and the group discover Maggie Adler's plan to fix the rifts—crossing to the other side of them and tuning the radio within. Alex repeatedly loops back to the past, mainly to times she talked with Michael. A ghost possesses Jonas and attempts to bargain with Alex, offering to spare her and the rest of her friends if they leave Clarissa behind. Returning to the caves, Alex tunes into a rift that sends her into a void. Encountering the possessed Clarissa, the ghosts warn Alex that she will die if the rift is closed, and Clarissa will be kept by the ghosts if Alex leaves through the rift. Alex can choose to leave, erasing Clarissa from existence; close the rift herself, trapping her with the ghosts; or, if she has found enough letters from Maggie Adler, Alex can appeal to the crew members directly, convincing them to let Clarissa and her go. The reflection of Alex giving her advice is revealed to be Alex from the future. She loops back to a conversation with Michael, who admits that he and Clarissa are planning to move away from town and asks for Alex's advice. Time then corrects.

Alex wakes up with the others on the ferry back home; Jonas informs her that whatever she did fixed the rift and that everything is normal. Everyone reveals that, for a limited period, they revisited past memories. They then swear to not tell anyone about their experiences. Nona takes a final group picture.

In an epilogue, Alex reveals the fate of the characters, with Nona's picture of the group shown and the outcomes dependent on actions made during the game:
Alex also describes her own plans; she may go to college, either in or out of her hometown or take time off. Thereafter, the screen flickers and Alex tells the player she is going to Edward's Island and is meeting Jonas for the first time, revealing that time is still looping.

If the player starts another game with the same save file (<a href="New%20Game%20Plus">New Game Plus</a>), Alex has the chance to send herself a message from the island. After the epilogue, a new scene plays of Alex, Jonas, and Ren at a supermarket waiting to buy alcohol before getting on the ferry. Tuning her radio, Alex receives the message her future self sent from the island. Depending on the message sent and how the player responds, Alex, Jonas, and Ren can decide not to go to Edwards Island at all, preventing the loop.

Cousins Sean Krankel and Adam Hines founded <a href="Night%20School%20Studio">Night School Studio</a> in 2014, having long wanted to collaborate on a video game together. Hines had worked on <a href="Telltale%20Games">Telltale Games</a>'s story-focused games like "<a href="Wolf%20Among%20Us">Wolf Among Us</a>", while Krankel had previously met or worked with many future Night School members at <a href="Disney">Disney</a>. Hines and Krankel were interested in creating a game that told its story in a unique way.

Krankel and Hines looked at other story-focused games, and felt that they either were linear stories driven by <a href="set%20piece">set piece</a>s, or branching, player choice-influenced stories told through <a href="cut%20scene">cut scene</a>s. "We thought, why not let you move freely while communicating, interacting, and exploring a branching narrative?" Krankel recalled. They wanted to make communication a key mechanic of the game, but allow more freedom than previous story-focused games. "At its core, we wanted to never have a cut scene in the game, where you could walk and move freely and communicate with your friends, and even communicate with other beings and other kind of strange things." Rather than developing the gameplay and attaching a story to it, Night School focused on developing gameplay that would support the story they wanted to tell. Because Night School was a small team, Hines and Krankel had to outline a scope for the game that would be manageable. This meant making sure branching <a href="dialogue%20tree">dialogue tree</a>s of possible conversation options never became too sprawling.

In developing the story, Krankel and Hines first looked at influences and other media that inspired them. They wanted the story to have scary and supernatural elements, without verging on horror. Krankel said, "We wanted to do something a little bit more ... <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Spielberg-ian</a>, and sort of give it a sense of wonder and have it, for awhile, just be actually interacting with these supernatural creatures where it's almost a little bit fun, and hopefully, gives you butterflies in your stomach before it gets pretty crazy." The developers were influenced by other coming-of-age stories such as the film "<a href="Stand%20by%20Me%20%28film%29">Stand By Me</a>" when developing the characters and story; Krankel cited the character of <a href="List%20of%20Freaks%20and%20Geeks%20characters%23Lindsay%20Weir">Lindsay Weir</a> from the television series "<a href="Freaks%20and%20Geeks">Freaks and Geeks</a>" as the biggest outside influence on the character of Alex.

Night School set up a <a href="Casting%20%28performing%20arts%29">casting call</a> for voice actors on the magazine "<a href="Backstage%20%28magazine%29">Backstage</a>". The team produced placeholder subtitles in the game prior to casting actors and recording lines. Lead engineer Bryant Cannon recalled that without the voices, he was unsure whether the game would be fun to play; after the voices were added, he could see the characters as believable people having conversations. Hines directed recording sessions, allowing him to change dialogue immediately if he felt material did not work when voiced by the actors. All of the actors voiced their lines separately and out of order, their conversations in-game being stitched together in post-production.

"Oxenfree" was developed primarily using the <a href="Unity%20%28game%20engine%29">Unity</a> game engine, <a href="Adobe%20Photoshop">Adobe Photoshop</a>, and <a href="Autodesk%20Maya">Autodesk Maya</a>. The game's artwork was made by Heather Gross. The team wanted to show multiple characters, dialogue bubbles, and places to explore in the environment on the screen simultaneously. This directly influenced the game's two-dimensional look and distance from the player characters on screen. Working with these requirements, Gross created <a href="Parallax%20scrolling">parallaxing</a>, painterly backgrounds. The dark, organic elements of the setting were designed in contrast to the supernatural elements, which are bright and geometric. The animation, art, and effects required for the game's major plot developments ended up taking more time than Hines and Krankel expected, but they found that it helped organize their story in the process.

American music composer and sound designer Andrew Rohrmann, known under his alias <a href="scntfc">scntfc</a>, created "Oxenfree"s audio. Krankel knew Rohrmann through a friend of a friend and had not known of his game music pedigree. Initially, Night School Studio was unsure about what they wanted the game's music to sound like. Hines mentioned that they gave Rohrmann "random" suggestions for the sound, including "<a href="John%20Carpenter">John Carpenter</a> meets <a href="Boards%20of%20Canada">Boards of Canada</a>", but were impressed with the music they got in response.

Krankel said the goal was for the music to feel simultaneously analog and digital, "so that it's nostalgic without being set in a specific time in the past". Rohrmann combined digital recording techniques and plugins with analog ones, running some sounds through old cassette decks and <a href="Reel-to-reel%20audio%20tape%20recording">reel-to-reel tape</a>. The shortwave radio Alex uses in the game was created by recording sounds through a <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>-era radio set. Much of the music was not scored to specific scenes, but for certain moods; Rohrmann estimated 90% of the songs in the completed game were identical to his original demo recordings. The soundtrack was released on January 15, 2016, to accompany the game, with a limited edition <a href="Gramophone%20record">vinyl</a> shipping later.
Night School posted a <a href="Teaser%20campaign">teaser</a> for the game on March 1, 2015. The game was announced four days later at the <a href="Game%20Developers%20Conference">Game Developers Conference</a>. In October 2015, it was announced that the game would be released in January 2016; this announcement coincided with a second teaser from the game. After release, <a href="Skybound%20Entertainment">Skybound Entertainment</a> approached Night School to help develop additional media for the game. In January 2016, Skybound released multiple episodes as part of their Creator Series about the creation of "Oxenfree", detailing the story, art, mechanics, and voice acting. In 2016, writer <a href="Robert%20Kirkman">Robert Kirkman</a> was reported to be planning to help adapt "Oxenfree" into a film via Skybound. Night School partnered with <a href="iam8bit">iam8bit</a> to create a collector's edition of the game, which featured items such as a cassette tape demo of Ren's band in the game, a map of the island, poster, and code for the game.

The <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> (PS4) version of the game was announced on April 27 and released May 31. The PS4 version of the game added the New Game+ mode as well as platform-specific tweaks, like using the <a href="DualShock%204">DualShock 4</a> controller to adjust the game's radio. An iOS version of the game was released on the <a href="Apple%20App%20Store">Apple App Store</a> on March 16, 2017.

The game also has an <a href="alternate%20reality%20game">alternate reality game</a> (ARG) counterpart. Within the game are radio frequencies that provide hints to a real phone number. This phone number led players to the Twitter account <a href="https%3A//twitter.com/xray9169363733">@xray9169363733.</a> The account posted various cryptic, coded messages, all of which seemed to point to a real world location. On May 7, 2016, <a href="Youtuber">Youtuber</a> <a href="Jesse%20Cox%20%28entertainer%29">Jesse Cox</a> posted a video similar to the PS4 "Oxenfree" trailer, but with several letters highlighted in red. This led players to <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20170420213853/http%3A//edwardsisland.com/">edwardsisland.com.</a> Several messages were found, but most important was "MILNER IS WARD", confirming that a special object would be hidden at <a href="Fort%20Ward%20%28Washington%29">Fort Ward, Washington</a>. On June 11, 2016, fans playing the ARG discovered the object was a box with letters by Alex from all the possible timelines from the game, and a manually operated tape player with two paper music tapes of songs from the game soundtrack.

"Oxenfree" was positively reviewed by critics, each version of the game receiving "generally favorable" reviews according to <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>" wrote that ""Oxenfree" shows some smart thinking about the relationship between games and players", and that as Night School's first game, it was an "auspicious debut". "<a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a>" praised the game for taking inspiration from old movies but still being "anything but generic", writing: "It dials into its own style and mood, tapping into something very heartfelt and special. It might just be the best 'horror' game I've played in years", they wrote. "<a href="Polygon%20%28website%29">Polygon</a>"s reviewer offered a less enthusiastic take, writing that despite offering many promising attributes, "I finished "Oxenfree" with my mouth agape, feeling wholly unsatisfied."

The game's audiovisual presentation was commonly considered a strength of the game. "Destruction" called the game's watercolor art style "gorgeous". "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" favorably contrasted "Oxenfree"s traditional media style with the much more common <a href="Retro%20style">retro</a> pixel styling of indie games. The magazine and others also favorably highlighted the contrast between the watercolor look of the environment and the sharp, digital effects of the paranormal; "Electronic Gaming Monthly" called it a "massive success" while "Destructoid" noted the usual softness of the visuals made the intrusion of digital elements feel more unnerving.

Reviewers felt that the naturalistic dialogue of "Oxenfree" was a strength, "Polygon" crediting "Oxenfree" for not relying on lazy or cliched speech and "GameSpot" highlighting the interplay between characters that deepened as the game progressed. "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>" in contrast felt that characters such as Ren had grating or stilted dialogue. "<a href="GamesTM">GamesTM</a>" and "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" credited the game with delivering organic dialogue options that lacked any clear good or bad associations. Reviewers such as VideoGamer.com's Tom Orry felt the script sometimes failed to convey realistic panic or distress of the characters in their exceptional circumstances. IGN's reviewer noted that despite her efforts, some dialogue choices unavoidably hurt relationships in the game. "It's an important reminder that you can't "win" social situations, and that kept Oxenfree's supernatural plot points grounded in reality", she wrote. "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" considered the opaque results of choices an occasional hindrance, with the opposite reactions of expected actions feeling "wrong". In contrast, "<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>" appreciated that some consequences of dialogue choices did not become clear until much later in the game, encouraging repeat playthroughs to try different approaches.

<doc id="49131332" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49131332" title="Oran fatwa">
Oran fatwa

The Oran fatwa was a "<a href="responsa">responsum</a>" <a href="fatwa">fatwa</a>, or an Islamic legal opinion, issued in 1504 to address the crisis that occurred when <a href="Islam%20in%20Spain">Muslims</a> in the <a href="Crown%20of%20Castile">Crown of Castile</a> (in Spain) were <a href="Forced%20conversions%20of%20Muslims%20in%20Spain">forced to convert</a> to Christianity in 15001502. The fatwa sets out detailed relaxations of the <a href="sharia">sharia</a> (Islamic law) requirements, allowing the Muslims to conform outwardly to Christianity and perform acts that are ordinarily forbidden in Islamic law, when necessary to survive. It includes relaxed instructions for fulfilling the <a href="salat">ritual prayers</a>, the <a href="zakat">ritual charity</a>, and the <a href="wudu">ritual ablution</a>, and recommendations when obliged to violate Islamic law, such as worshipping as Christians, committing <a href="Islam%20and%20blasphemy">blasphemy</a>, and consuming pork and wine.

The fatwa enjoyed wide currency among Muslims and <a href="Morisco">Morisco</a>s (Muslims nominally converted to Christianity and their descendants) in <a href="History%20of%20Spain%23Early%20Modern%20Spain">Spain</a>, and one of the surviving <a href="aljamiado">aljamiado</a> translations was dated at 1564, 60years after the original fatwa. The fatwa has been described as the "key <a href="Kalam">theological</a> document" to understand the practice of Spanish Muslims following the <a href="Reconquista">Reconquista</a> up to the <a href="expulsion%20of%20the%20Moriscos">expulsion of the Moriscos</a>. The author of the fatwa ("mufti") was <a href="Ahmad%20ibn%20Abi%20Jum%27ah">Ahmad ibn Abi Jum'ah</a>, a North African scholar of Islamic law of the <a href="Maliki">Maliki</a> school. The fatwa was termed the "<a href="Oran">Oran</a> fatwa" by modern scholars, due to the word "Al-Wahrani" ("of Oran") that appears in the text as part of the author's name.

The influence of the fatwa was limited to Spain. Outside the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, the predominant opinion upheld the requirements of Islamic law and required Muslims to emigrate, or even choose <a href="martyrdom%20in%20Islam">martyrdom</a>, when the orthodox observance of the religion became impossible.

Islam has been present in Spain since the <a href="Umayyad%20conquest%20of%20Hispania">Umayyad conquest of Hispania</a> in the eighth century. At the beginning of the twelfth century, the Muslim population in the Iberian Peninsula — called "<a href="Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a>" by the Muslims — was estimated to number up to 5.5 million, among whom were <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a>, <a href="Berbers">Berbers</a> and indigenous converts. In the next few centuries, as the Christians pushed from the north in a process called "<a href="reconquista">reconquista</a>", the Muslim population declined. At the end of the fifteenth century, the "reconquista" culminated in the <a href="Granada%20War">fall of Granada</a>, and the total number of Muslims in Spain was estimated to be between 500,000 and 600,000 out of the total Spanish population of 7 to 8 million. Approximately half of the Muslims lived in the former <a href="Emirate%20of%20Granada">Emirate of Granada</a>, the last independent Muslim state in Spain, which had been annexed to the <a href="Crown%20of%20Castile">Crown of Castile</a>. About 20,000 Muslims lived in other territories of Castile, and most of the remainder lived in the territories of the <a href="Crown%20of%20Aragon">Crown of Aragon</a>.

Prior to the completion of the "reconquista", the defeated Muslims were generally given <a href="freedom%20of%20religion">freedom of religion</a> as terms of their surrender. For example, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Granada">Treaty of Granada</a>, which governed the surrender of the emirate, guaranteed a set of rights to the conquered Muslims, including religious tolerance and fair treatment, in return for their capitulation. The increasing occurrences of forced conversion triggered <a href="Rebellion%20of%20the%20Alpujarras%20%281499%E2%80%931501%29">a series of Muslim rebellions</a> in Granada (1499–1501). The rebellions were suppressed, and afterwards the Muslims in Granada were no longer given the rights that had been provided to them by the Treaty of Granada. They were given the choice to remain and accept <a href="baptism">baptism</a>, to reject baptism and be enslaved or killed, or to be exiled. The option of exile was often not feasible in practice because of the difficulty in uprooting one's family and making the journey to Muslim lands in North Africa, the inability to pay the fee required by the authorities for safe passage, and the general tendency by the authorities to discourage and hinder such an exodus.

Some Muslims, especially those living near the <a href="Andalusia">southern coast</a>, took the option of exile, but for most, publicly converting to Christianity while secretly continuing to believe and practise Islam was the only available option for surviving as Muslims. The population converted "en masse", and by 1501 the entire Muslim population of Granada was nominally converted to Christianity. The apparent success of Granada's forced conversions triggered a series of edicts and proclamations in 1501 and 1502 which effectively put the Muslims elsewhere in Castile to the same fate. These new converts, along with their descendants, were known by Spanish sources as the <a href="Morisco">Morisco</a>s. As well as having to accept Christianity and abandon the Islamic faith and rituals, they were also pressured to conform to Christian ways, including by attending church, sending their children to be instructed in the Christian doctrine, and partaking of food and beverages <a href="Islamic%20dietary%20laws">forbidden</a> by Islamic law.

Prior to the Oran fatwa, the predominant position of Islamic scholars had been that a Muslim could not stay in a country where rulers made proper religious observance impossible. Therefore, a Muslim's obligation was to leave, when they were able to do so. Even before the systematic forcible conversion, religious leaders had argued that Muslims in Christian territory would be subject to direct and indirect pressure, and preached emigration as a way to protect the religion from erosion. Notably, the contemporary North African scholar <a href="Ahmad%20al-Wansharisi">Ahmad al-Wansharisi</a>, who was considered the leading authority on the subject of Muslims in Spain, wrote in 1491 that emigrating from Christian to Muslim lands was compulsory in almost all circumstances. Further, Al-Wansharisi urged severe punishment for the Muslims who remained and predicted that they would temporarily dwell in <a href="Jahannam">hell in the afterlife</a>.

The surviving translations of the fatwa give the name of the author in various slightly different forms. All of them are thought to be derived from the <a href="Arabic%20name">Arabic name</a> Ahmad ibn Abi Jum'ah al-Maghrawi al-Wahrani, with some adding the name 'Ubaydallah, which might be a pious formula meaning "the little servant of God". The author's <a href="Nisba%20%28onomastics%29">nisba</a> — the part of his name that indicates place of origin — "al-Wahrani" ("of Oran") refers to the city of <a href="Oran">Oran</a> (,"Wahran") in modern-day <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>, then part of the <a href="Zayyanid%20dynasty">Zayyanid</a> <a href="kingdom%20of%20Tlemcen">kingdom of Tlemcen</a>. Thus, the author is often referred to as "the "Mufti" of Oran" and the document is called "the Oran fatwa", even though there appeared to be no indication that the fatwa was issued in Oran or that the author resided or had an official authority in Oran. <a href="Devin%20J.%20Stewart">Devin Stewart</a>, an academic specialist in <a href="Islamic%20studies">Islamic studies</a>, identified the author as <a href="Ahmad%20ibn%20Abi%20Jum%27ah">Abu al-Abbas Ahmad ibn Abi Jum'ah al-Maghrawi al-Wahrani</a> (b.unknownd.1511 in <a href="Fez">Fez</a>), a <a href="Maliki">Maliki</a> jurist who had studied in Oran and <a href="Tlemcen">Tlemcen</a> and probably issued the fatwa in <a href="Fez%2C%20Morocco">Fez</a> while a professor of Islamic law there.

Al-Wahrani drafted the fatwa in response to a request of legal opinion, in other words, as a "<a href="responsa">responsum</a>", to Muslim petitioners who wished to learn if they could continue to live in Christian Spain. The recipient of the fatwa is not named. The commonly accepted date of the composition of the fatwa is 1<a href="Rajab">Rajab</a> 910AH, as this was the date that appears in most of the surviving manuscripts. This day in the <a href="Islamic%20calendar">Islamic calendar</a> corresponds to around 8December 1504. One manuscript added "3May 1563" in addition to 1Rajab 910, which would have been a date conversion error, but both Stewart and the historian <a href="L.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BP.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BHarvey">L. P. Harvey</a> have suggested that the 1563 date might have been the time of the translation. One other manuscript gives "Rajab909", which was probably a copying error.

The opening of the fatwa displayed sympathy to the Muslims of Spain, who kept their religious faith despite the suffering and risk that this posed them. The "mufti" (author of the fatwa) exhorted that they continue to adhere to the religion of Islam and instruct it to their children when the latter reached maturity.

The fatwa reaffirmed the obligation of Spanish Muslims to perform the <a href="salat">ritual prayers</a> ("salat"), the <a href="zakat">ritual charity</a> ("zakat"), and the ritual ablution ("<a href="ghusl">ghusl</a>"), even if they could not be performed in the correct form. It described the obligation of the ritual prayersnormally performed by standing, bowing, <a href="prostration">prostrating</a>, and sitting in a prescribed sequenceeven if done only by making slight movements. The fatwa also allowed the omission of the prayersnormally performed an obligatory five times a day at prescribed timeswhen they were prevented from doing so, and instructed them to make up the missed prayers at night instead. It also provided instructions for performing the <a href="tayammum">ritual dry ablution</a> ("tayammum") when ritually pure water was not available, to replace the <a href="wudu">ritual ablution</a> ("wudu") that is ordinarily required before performing the "salat". When "tayammum" was not possible, even making slight pointing motions with hands or face toward clean earth, stone, or tree was acceptable.

The fatwa also maintained the Islamic obligation to give the ritual charity ("zakat")normally calculated and distributed in a specific manner prescribed by the <a href="sharia">sharia</a> (Islamic law)even if this could only be done by showing generosity to a beggar. It affirmed the obligation of the ritual ablution ("ghusl"), "even though by plunging into the sea".

The fatwa permitted Muslims outwardly to participate in Christian rituals and worship, so long as they inwardly considered them to be forbidden. When the Muslims had to prostrate to Christian "idols", they were to internally desire to perform the Islamic prayer, even if not actually <a href="Qibla">facing Mecca</a>, and when they bowed down to the "idols", they were to focus their attention toward <a href="God%20in%20Islam">Allah</a>. When obliged to commit <a href="Islam%20and%20blasphemy">blasphemy</a>, such as cursing <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, or accepting <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> as the <a href="God%20the%20Son">son of God</a> or <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Mary</a> as <a href="Veneration%20of%20Mary%20in%20the%20Catholic%20Church">God's wife</a> ["<a href="sic">sic</a>"], the fatwa instructed them to do so, and to employ "whatever stratagems" they could to negate their meaning whenever possible. For example, the fatwa suggested mispronouncing the name of Muhammad, or intending to curse someone else with a similar name, when being required to curse the prophet.

The fatwa also allowed Spain's Muslims to consume <a href="alcohol%20in%20Islam">wine</a>, <a href="Religious%20restrictions%20on%20the%20consumption%20of%20pork">pork</a>, and other things normally forbidden by the sharia, as long as the Muslims did not intend to take advantage of them and rejected them in their hearts. The fatwa reaffirmed the permissibility of a Muslim man <a href="Interfaith%20marriage%20in%20Islam">marrying a Christian woman</a>, under the reasoning that both Muslims and Christians were <a href="People%20of%20the%20Book">People of the Book</a>. Marriage between a Muslim woman and a Christian man was to be avoided unless under duress, and while doing so the Muslims should "cleave firmly to the belief that that is forbidden".

At the end of the fatwa, the author encouraged the Muslims to write to the "mufti" about anything else that presented difficulty to them, so that he could give further legal opinions. The fatwa discreetly did not name any specific recipient, and instead designated the persons it was addressed to by ""al-guraba"" (those living abroad) yet near to Allah".

The fatwa appeared to enjoy wide currency within the Muslim and Morisco community in various kingdoms of Spain, for it was translated and copied as late as 1563 and 1609. The full geographical reach of the text is unknown, but it appeared to be originally addressed to the Muslims (or Moriscos) of Castile as a response to their forced conversions in 1500–1502. After the forced conversion was extended to the Crown of Aragon in the 1520s, the fatwa likely circulated there, too.

The opinion formed the basis of the Moriscos' Islamic status and practices for more than a century, until <a href="Expulsion%20of%20the%20Moriscos">their expulsion</a> in 1609–1614. This led to a non-traditional form of Islam, in which one's internal intention ("<a href="niyya">niyya</a>"), rather than external observation of rituals and laws, was the defining characteristic of one's Islam. Generations of Moriscos were born and died within this religious climate. Hybrid or undefined religious practice featured in many Morisco texts. For example, the works of the Morisco writer known as "the <a href="Young%20Man%20of%20Ar%C3%A9valo">Young Man of Arévalo</a>", written c.1530s described <a href="crypto-Muslim">crypto-Muslim</a>s using Christian worship as replacement for regular Islamic rituals, as recommended in the fatwa.

The influence of the fatwa was limited to Spain. Outside the Iberian Peninsula, the predominant opinion continued to uphold the unbending requirements of Islamic law and required Muslims to leave any country, or even choose <a href="martyrdom%20in%20Islam">martyrdom</a>, where approved observance of the religion became impossible.

Modern scholars of Spanish Islamic history stressed the historical importance of the fatwa. Harvey called it "the key theological document" for the study of Spanish Islam following the forced conversions, a description which Stewart repeated. Mercedes García-Arenal and Fernando Rodríguez Mediano, historians of Spain and Western Muslims, described the fatwa as "famous" and called it "one of the most important theological texts of later Spanish Islam". Spanish literature scholar María del Mar Rosa-Rodríguez considered the fatwa important because it officially documented "the existence of religiosities that do not depend on traditional ritual practice".

Harvey and Stewart said that the fatwa was a departure from the previous legal opinions among Islamic scholars, which typically emphasised the obligation to emigrate from any country where proper religious observance was not possible. Notably, the Maliki scholar <a href="al-Wansharisi">al-Wansharisi</a>, the leading living authority on the issue, was among the proponents of this view. Stewart contended that, while the fatwa's text did not mention any opponent, it was intended as a rebuke against the views of al-Wansharisi. Recipients of this fatwa would be able to stay put, outwardly conforming to Christianity and not see themselves as abandoning their faith. The fatwa addressed the recipient as ""al-guraba"", a word that means "outsiders" or "those living abroad", but this word also appears in several <a href="hadith">hadith</a>s (sayings of <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>) and evokes a spiritual meaning of heroic Muslims loyal to their faith in spite of great suffering. The sympathy shown by the author, as well as his acknowledgement of the Muslims' loyalty and suffering, is in contrast with the predominant opinion such as al-Wansharisi's which saw them unfavourably.

Harvey did not consider the fatwa as a permanent and universal relaxation of the sharia; instead, the sender and the recipients of the fatwa must have seen its provisions as temporary expedients under extraordinary circumstances intended to help the Muslims of Spain through the crisis. The fatwa began by affirming in orthodox terms the obligations of all Muslims, and ended by expressing hopes that Islam may again be practised openly without ordeals, tribulations and fear. The "mufti" and many Moriscos expected or hoped that the crisis to end at some not-too-distant time. Rosa-Rodriguez noted that the fatwa stated a hope that the "Noble Turks" would soon intervene and end the religious persecution in Spain, a reference to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>'s growing power in the Mediterranean at the time. This hope did not materialise, and the religious persecution in Spain continued, causing the fatwa's recommendations to become the normal way of practicing Islam for generations.

Harvey also noted that the fatwa covered a wide range of Islamic religious duties, while usually a "responsum" fatwa only addresses a specific enquiry on a difficult point of detail. The fatwa also went into specific practical challenges faced by Muslims in Spain, such as the pressure to curse Muhammad, eat pork, drink wine, and intermarry with the Christians. This suggests that the author had some knowledge of what life under Christian rule was like.

<a href="Amin%20Maalouf">Amin Maalouf</a>'s 1986 novel "<a href="Leo%20Africanus%20%28novel%29">Leo Africanus</a>" features a fictionalised version of the fatwa. In the novel, Muslim exiles from Granada and the local <a href="ulama">ulama</a> (Islamic scholars) held meetings in Fez to provide counsel to the Muslims in Granada, who sent letters describing their persecution and their dilemma. Amid the meetings, the protagonist of the novel witnessed the "man from Oran" delivering a speech similar in content to the Oran fatwa.

As of 2006, there are four known surviving manuscripts containing the fatwa. One of them is an Arabic copy, discovered by <a href="Muhammad%20Abdullah%20%27Inan">Muhammad Abdullah 'Inan</a> in <a href="Vatican%20City">the Vatican</a> in 1951 and kept in the Borgiano collection of the <a href="Vatican%20Library">Vatican Library</a>. The other three were translations to <a href="aljamiado">Spanish written in the Arabic script</a> ("aljamiado"). One of them was kept in <a href="Aix-en-Provence">Aix-en-Provence</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, and one in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>, Spain. The third "aljamiado" translation used to be in Madrid, but its location is currently unknown.

Since the discovery, the texts have been transcribed or translated into modern <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, <a href="English%20language">English</a> and <a href="German%20language">German</a>. Historian L. P. Harvey provides a near-complete English translation in his book "Muslims in Spain, 1500 to 1615".

Devon County War Memorial

The Devon County War Memorial is a <a href="First%20World%20War%20memorial">First World War memorial</a>, designed by <a href="Sir%20Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a> and situated on Cathedral Green in <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>, the <a href="county%20town">county town</a> of <a href="Devon">Devon</a>, in the south west of England. It is one of fifteen War Crosses designed by Lutyens with similar characteristics, and one of two to serve as a civic memorial in a city. The first proposal for the county's war memorial was to complete the construction of a <a href="cloister">cloister</a> at <a href="Exeter%20Cathedral">Exeter Cathedral</a> to be dedicated to Devon's war dead, but this scheme was abandoned due to lack of funds. After considering multiple proposals, the Devon County War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead. The committee chose to site the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral after scouting several locations. A war memorial for Exeter itself was being considered concurrently, but the committees for the two projects failed to work together, resulting in two separate memorials—the county memorial by the cathedral and <a href="Exeter%20City%20War%20Memorial">Exeter City War Memorial</a> in <a href="Northernhay%20Gardens">Northernhay Gardens</a>.

The memorial takes the form of a simple cross. Hewn from a single block of granite quarried from <a href="Haytor">Haytor</a> on <a href="Dartmoor">Dartmoor</a>, it stands just to the west of the cathedral, in alignment with the altar. The cross stands on a granite plinth, which itself sits on three steps. It was unveiled by the <a href="Edward%20VIII">Prince of Wales</a> on 16 May 1921. After archaeological excavations took place in the 1970s, the area was remodelled to create a processional way between the memorial and the cathedral. The memorial is a grade II* <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>, part of a "national collection" of Lutyens' war memorials. Since 2015, all of Lutyens' memorials in England have been protected by listed building status.

During the aftermath of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect <a href="Sir%20Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>, described by <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> as "the leading English architect of his generation". Prior to the First World War, Lutyens established his reputation designing country houses for wealthy patrons, including <a href="Castle%20Drogo">Castle Drogo</a> to the west of Exeter. Following the war he devoted much of his time to memorialising the casualties. He served as one of the three principal architects to the <a href="Imperial%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Imperial War Graves Commission</a> (IWGC) and designed numerous war memorials for towns and villages across Britain, as well as several elsewhere in the Commonwealth. His most famous design was <a href="The%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">the Cenotaph</a> on <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a> in London, which became the focus for the national <a href="Remembrance%20Sunday">Remembrance Sunday</a> commemorations.

The Devon County memorial is one of fifteen War Crosses designed by Lutyens to a similar specification between 1920 and 1925. Most of Lutyens' War Crosses were commissioned for small villages, but the Devon County memorial is one of two commissioned as a civic memorial in a city—the other being the <a href="York%20City%20War%20Memorial">York City War Memorial</a>.

The first proposal to commemorate Devon's war dead came from the Dean of Exeter in December 1918, a month after the signing of the armistice. The Dean suggested that a <a href="cloister">cloister</a> could be built at <a href="Exeter%20Cathedral">Exeter Cathedral</a>, possibly containing a monument, to serve as a war memorial but the idea was abandoned early in 1919 due to a lack of funds. Another proposal which attracted attention in the local media was for the construction of a new wing at the <a href="Royal%20Devon%20and%20Exeter%20Hospital">Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital</a>. The idea of building a war memorial at all proved controversial—the chairman of the local branch of the <a href="National%20Federation%20of%20Discharged%20and%20Demobilized%20Sailors%20and%20Soldiers">National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers</a> felt that the funds would be better spent caring for surviving veterans and condemned the idea of a memorial as a "useless waste of money". <a href="Devon%20County%20Council">Devon County Council</a> formed the County War Memorial Committee, chaired by <a href="Hugh%20Fortescue%2C%204th%20Earl%20Fortescue">Hugh Fortescue, 4th Earl Fortescue</a>, to consider 23 proposals including several submitted by the public. 

The committee was reliant on public donations and realised that it was unlikely to raise a large sum of money as communities across Devon would be focusing on their own commemorations and commissioning individual war memorials. Despite this, the committee was determined to erect some sort of memorial to the county's war dead, and as a compromise sought a simple but elegant monument. They commissioned Lutyens in 1920 and opted for his War Cross design. The committee considered several potential sites, including Cawsand Beacon on <a href="Dartmoor">Dartmoor</a> and the <a href="Haldon%20Hills">Haldon Hills</a> in south Devon, but the committee's preferred location was the <a href="Cathedral%20Close%2C%20Exeter">cathedral close</a> of Exeter, Devon's <a href="county%20town">county town</a>. The specific site was chosen so that the memorial would be visible from the High Street and Broadgate. With its remaining funds, the Devon County War Memorial Committee supported the construction of a battlefield memorial at <a href="La%20Ville-aux-Bois-l%C3%A8s-Pontavert">La Ville-aux-Bois-lès-Pontavert</a> in France to honour the 2nd Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment, who endured particularly heavy fighting at <a href="Bois%20des%20Buttes%20%28Battle%20honour%29">Bois des Buttes</a> during the <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20the%20Aisne">Third Battle of the Aisne</a>.

The memorial is one of two major war memorials in Exeter, the other being the <a href="Exeter%20City%20War%20Memorial">Exeter City War Memorial</a> in <a href="Northernhay%20Gardens">Northernhay Gardens</a> (the former grounds of <a href="Rougemont%20Castle">Rougemont Castle</a>). Exeter Cathedral also contains memorials to the <a href="Devonshire%20Regiment">Devonshire Regiment</a> and the Wessex Field Ambulance. The city war memorial was the responsibility of a separate committee under the authority of <a href="Exeter%20City%20Council">Exeter City Council</a>. The city and county memorial committees conspicuously failed to co-operate. According to Sir James Owen, chairman of the city committee, the city offered a joint committee but the county "slammed the door in our face", while Lord Fortescue accused the city of proceeding with its own project without any discussion with the county. Both committees wanted to design the principal memorial for Devon with the other simply contributing funds, but neither was willing to relinquish control. The result was that two very different memorials were constructed in Exeter—the city's memorial takes the form of a figure of Victory on a large pedestal surrounded by further sculptures to form a cross.

The project proceeded simply once the design was agreed. The memorial was built on the Cathedral Green, just to the west of the cathedral itself, in alignment with the <a href="altar">altar</a>—according to historian Hazel Harvey, "it faces east, standing on a hypothetical line drawn from the high altar through the nave of the cathedral". It lies to the northwest of a metal cross, the steeple finial from the <a href="church%20of%20St%20Mary%20Major%2C%20Exeter">church of St Mary Major, Exeter</a>, marking the former location of that building which was demolished in 1971.

The memorial takes the form of a granite cross, quarried from <a href="Haytor">Haytor</a> on Dartmoor, and hewn from a single stone—the largest Lutyens was able to acquire. The cross is formed of a tapering flattened hexagonal shaft to which <a href="chamfer">chamfer</a>ed arms, no wider than the base, are moulded close to the top. It stands on a three-tiered base and a rectangular plinth, which itself sits on three stone steps as is customary for Lutyens' war memorials. The central tier of the base bears the inscription "THE COUNTY OF DEVON TO HER GLORIOUS DEAD / 1914–1919 / <a href="Te%20deum">TE DEUM LAUDAMUS</a> / 1939–1945". Upon its completion, Lutyens said of the monument, "it is very simple and a monolith and its subtlety in line means labour, care and thought. [...] It should endure forever".

The memorial was unveiled on <a href="Whit%20Monday">Whit Monday</a>, 16 May 1921, by the Prince of Wales (later King <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward VIII</a>), with Lutyens in attendance. At the unveiling ceremony, Lord Fortescue gave a speech in which he estimated that 11,600 men and women from Devon had been killed while serving in the war. He later stated that some 63,700 (8,000 regulars, 36,700 volunteers, and 19,000 conscripts) had served in the armed forces. The names of the fallen were recorded on a roll of honour, of which three copies were made: one for Exeter Cathedral, one to be held by the county council, and one which the Prince of Wales placed in a hollow in the base of the war memorial. The prince's visit generated considerable excitement in the area. Thousands of people lined the street to greet his motorcade and shops on the High Street hung out banners with welcoming messages. After the unveiling, Edward spent ten days touring the local area.

Archaeological excavations in the western part of the Cathedral Green in 1971 uncovered the remains of several Roman buildings including baths. The ruins were re-buried due to a lack of funds for preservation work, but were <a href="Scheduled%20monument">scheduled</a> as an ancient monument. In 1974, a processional way between the war memorial and the cathedral was commissioned from <a href="Sir%20Geoffrey%20Jellicoe">Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe</a>. His design—which was implemented after further excavations took place in 1976—consisted of a square forecourt at the west front of the cathedral from which a set of wide, shallow steps lead up to a platform at the memorial, emphasising its alignment with the altar and strengthening its visual connection with the cathedral. An inscription was added in 1979 giving the dates of the Second World War. A set of metal railings—described by author Tim Skelton as "an unfortunate addition"—was erected around the foot of the memorial in 2006 in response to problems with vandalism and anti-social behaviour. 

On 16 April 2009, the memorial—including the processional way—was designated a grade II* <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> for its special architectural or historic interest, a status which provides legal protection from unauthorised demolition or modification. In November 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a "national collection". All 44 of his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their <a href="National%20Heritage%20List%20for%20England">National Heritage List for England</a> list entries updated and expanded.

The film's theme is a person's right to dream and change their lives, irrespective of social status.

Released in India on 22 April 2016, "<a href="Nil%20Battey%20Sannata">Nil Battey Sannata</a>" was distributed by <a href="Eros%20International">Eros International</a> and garnered critical and audience acclaim.

At the <a href="62nd%20Filmfare%20Awards">62nd Filmfare Awards</a>, Iyer won the <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Debut%20Director">Filmfare Award for Best Debut Director</a>, while Bhaskar and Shukla won the <a href="Screen%20Awards">Screen Awards</a> for Best Actress (Critics) and Best Child Artist respectively. The film did well at the box-office, collecting a total of around during its entire theatrical run. The same year, the film was remade in <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a> as "<a href="Amma%20Kanakku">Amma Kanakku</a>", with Iyer returning to direct. The following year, it was remade in <a href="Malayalam">Malayalam</a> as "<a href="Udaharanam%20Sujatha">Udaharanam Sujatha</a>".

Apeksha "Apu" Shivlal Sahay (Shukla) is an unmotivated student who has managed to reach her <a href="Secondary%20School%20Certificate">SSC</a> year in school despite her lack of interest in studying further. She struggles in mathematics alongside her friends, Sweety (Neha Prajapati) and Pintu (Prashant Tiwari). Her single mother Chanda (Bhaskar), a high-school drop-out, works four different menial jobs, which include working as a maid for Dr. Diwan (Pathak).

Troubled by her daughter's indifferent attitude, Chanda narrates her dilemma to Dr. Diwan, who suggests that she hire a math tutor for Apu. Chanda is told that Apu must pass her <a href="Board%20examination">pre-board</a> math exams to receive a considerable discount for the tuition. Hearing this, Apu replies that she is destined to work as a maid, as Chanda cannot provide financially for any higher education. With the encouragement of Dr. Diwan, Chanda enrolls in Apu's school so that she can learn math and tutor Apu herself. This embarrasses Apu, and she continuously ridicules her mother. No one, except for the school's principal Mr. Srivastava (Tripathi), is aware of Chanda's relationship to Apu; she manages to befriend Apu's classmates, including Sweety and Pintu, and impresses her teachers with her steady progress. Chanda enlists the help of her shy classmate Amar (Vishal Nath) to understand math and makes use of <a href="mind%20map">mind map</a>s on his advice.

Apu is angered by her mother's success in math, as she herself continues to fail to understand it. Chanda challenges Apu to achieve grades higher than hers in math; if she is successful, Chanda promises to drop out of school. With Amar's help and constant studying, Apu manages to complete the challenge. Her mother is overjoyed, but is heartbroken when Apu informs her that she performed well in school with the sole purpose of ensuring her mother's absence at school. In her anger, Chanda breaks her promise and returns to school, performing even better than before, much to Apu's chagrin. After allotting more time to school, Chanda loses one of her four jobs and begins to work at a restaurant because Amar recommends the job.

One night, she is dropped off at home by one of her male colleagues; Apu witnesses this and assumes that Chanda has been <a href="Solicitation%23England%20and%20Wales">soliciting</a>. She steals the money that Chanda has been collecting to pay for the math tuition and spends it all on food and new clothes. This devastates Chanda, who becomes depressed when Apu tells her that the money was not hard-earned. Chanda stops attending school and continues to work with the hope that Apu will join the <a href="Indian%20Administrative%20Service">Indian Administrative Service</a>, after she is inspired by a kind <a href="District%20Collector%20%28India%29">District Magistrate and Collector</a> (<a href="Sanjay%20Suri">Sanjay Suri</a>). In the meantime, Amar helps Apu realise her mistake by making her witness Chanda working at the restaurant. Apu rekindles her interest in school and begins to treat her mother with respect, having realised that she can perform well if she possesses the will. She brings her mother back to school and the duo finish their SSC year together.

With a scenic view of the <a href="Taj%20Mahal">Taj Mahal</a>, Chanda motivates Apu to always follow her dreams, as they are dependent on efforts and not circumstances. A few years later, Apu attends her <a href="Union%20Public%20Service%20Commission">Union Public Service Commission</a> <a href="Civil%20Services%20Examination%20%28India%29">Civil Service Examination</a> interview, having passed her examinations successfully. After being asked what inspired her to apply for the <a href="Indian%20Administrative%20Service">IAS</a>, she answers that she is inspired by her mother, who now tutors struggling math students for free.

The cast is listed below:

"Nil Battey Sannata" was directed by <a href="Ashwiny%20Iyer%20Tiwari">Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari</a> in her directorial debut. She conceived the idea for the film while working with <a href="Leo%20Burnett%20Worldwide">Leo Burnett Worldwide</a>, a <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>-based advertising company, for a "<a href="Kaun%20Banega%20Crorepati">Kaun Banega Crorepati</a>" promotional video. The screenplay was written by Iyer, Neeraj Singh, Pranjal Choudhary and <a href="Nitesh%20Tiwari">Nitesh Tiwari</a>. In an interview with "<a href="The%20Indian%20Express">The Indian Express</a>", Iyer said that "the story of "Nil Battey Sannata" is relevant as well as inspiring". The film's title translates to "Zero Divided by Zero Equals Nothing", and is a slang for "Good For Nothing".

After going through the script, <a href="JAR%20Pictures">JAR Pictures</a>' Ajay G. Rai decided to produce the film, and insisted on Iyer to direct it as well. Although initially reluctant, Iyer agreed to direct and learnt the major aspects of cinematography as a part of her preparation. Gavemic U Ary worked as the cinematographer for the film, and Kunal Sharma headed the sound department. The visual effects were provided by <a href="Prasad%20Studios">Prasad Film Labs</a>, a motion picture post-production studio based in <a href="Hyderabad">Hyderabad</a>, and the costumes were designed by Sachin Lovalekar.

<a href="Mukesh%20Chhabra">Mukesh Chhabra</a> was the film's casting director. Swara Bhaskar was the first to be cast in the role of Chanda Sahay, a single mother of a 15-year-old girl. Initially sceptical about playing a mother on screen early in her career, she changed her mind after reading the script. To understand the role better, Bhaskar stayed with professional domestic helpers from <a href="Agra">Agra</a>, <a href="Uttar%20Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a>, where the film is set. She bought such props as a handbag, a comb, a pocket mirror, and rubber "<a href="Flip-flops%23etymology">chappals</a>". She also drew guidance from her mother's experiences of handling a teenage daughter. After the film's release, Bhaskar said in an interview with "<a href="Daily%20News%20and%20Analysis">Daily News and Analysis</a>" that her friends in the Hindi film industry advised her not to take up the role as they felt it would be a "career suicide" for her. She agreed to participate in the project because "the story stayed in [her] mind". The next role to be cast was that of the 15-year-old daughter of the protagonist. Ria Shukla was selected for the role after auditions in <a href="Lucknow">Lucknow</a>. Ratna Pathak and Pankaj Tripathi play supporting roles in the film. A group of around 25 local children played the students at the school.

Principal photography for "Nil Battey Sannata" commenced in May 2014 at Agra, and was completed by the end of November. At several locations in Agra, the crew found it difficult to manage an "over-enthusiastic crowd". The <a href="Film%20editing">editing process</a> began immediately after, and was supervised by Chandrashekhar Prajapati of the Pixon Studios. The <a href="editor%27s%20cut">editor's cut</a> was submitted for the Work-in-Progress Lab at the <a href="National%20Film%20Development%20Corporation%20of%20India">NFDC</a> Film Bazaar. Distributed by <a href="Eros%20International">Eros International</a> in India, "Nil Battey Sannata"s <a href="Final%20cut%20%28film%20editing%29">final cut</a> ran for a total of 104 minutes.

The music for "Nil Battey Sannata" was composed by newcomers Rohan and Vinayak, with Manoj Yadav, Nitesh Tiwari and Shreyas Jain as lyricists for the soundtrack. Joginder Tuteja's mixed review for <a href="Bollywood%20Hungama">Bollywood Hungama</a> was largely appreciative of the songs "Murabba" and "Maths Mein Dabba Gul", also acknowledging the soundtrack's "rural flavor". He deemed the overall album to be "strictly situational". "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>" critic Mohar Basu gave the soundtrack a 3 out 5 star rating, saying that the "album wins you over with its innocence". Praising the pleasant "Murabba" and the catchy "Maths Mein Dabba", he asserted that the film "has music that will touch your heart".

The film had its world premiere in the last week of September 2015 at the Silk Road Film Festival, <a href="Fuzhou">Fuzhou</a>, <a href="China">China</a>. It was released under the title of "The New Classmate", as it was at such international film festivals like the <a href="Marrakech%20International%20Film%20Festival">Marrakech International Film Festival</a> and the <a href="Cleveland%20International%20Film%20Festival">Cleveland International Film Festival</a>. The film then went on to be screened at the <a href="BFI%20London%20Film%20Festival">BFI London Film Festival</a> (LFF) on 23 October 2015, and was lauded at the event. The release of the first look of the film coincided with the <a href="International%20Women%27s%20Day">International Women's Day</a>, 8 March. In the poster of the film, a smiling Swara Bhaskar is seen taking a leap with Ria Shukla in a red <a href="sari">sari</a> and a blue <a href="Shalwar%20kameez">salwar kameez</a> respectively. The poster was unveiled by the actress <a href="Sonam%20Kapoor">Sonam Kapoor</a>, a close friend of Bhaskar. The official trailer was released by Eros productions on 22 March 2016. The launch took place at a media session in a classroom set-up with Bhaskar, Shukla and Pankaj Tripathi. At the event, the film's producer <a href="Anand%20L%20Rai">Anand L Rai</a> said, "I associated with "Nil Battey Sannata" straight from my heart and I'm feeling very proud of the film." The trailer was well received by both critics and audiences. A reviewer for "Daily News and Analysis" thought of it as "heartwarming". The film had its theatrical release in India on 22 April 2016.

"Nil Battey Sannata" released in India on fewer than 300 screens and had an average opening at the box-office. It collected on its opening, but the figure grew on the second day as a result of positive <a href="word%20of%20mouth">word of mouth</a> reviews. The film collected on Saturday and on Sunday bringing the opening weekend collections to . The film faced competition from other small-budget Hindi film releases "<a href="Laal%20Rang">Laal Rang</a>" and "<a href="Santa%20Banta%20Pvt%20Ltd">Santa Banta Pvt Ltd</a>" in its opening weekend at the box-office, but was expected to do well because of the positive reviews and good word of mouth. The film collected in its opening week. It was declared tax free in the states of Uttar Pradesh and <a href="New%20Delhi">New Delhi</a> by their respective state governments. The film became a commercial success, and continued through the second week, increasing in rural areas of the country. It had an impressive six-week run at the box office and its lifetime collections were around .

"Nil Battey Sannata" opened to critical acclaim, and was positively received by the audiences as well. It received overwhelming praise, chiefly for the direction, and for Bhaskar, Shukla and Tripathi. Kunal Guha of the "<a href="Mumbai%20Mirror">Mumbai Mirror</a>" wrote, "It's rare to come across films that force you to keep aside your yardsticks of what a good film is and dive into the experience". Namrata Thakur of <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff.com</a> gave the film the highest praise and deemed it "an absolute gem", saying "there is hardly a dull moment in the film". She considered it the feel-good film of the year, comparing it to 2015's "<a href="Dum%20Laga%20Ke%20Haisha">Dum Laga Ke Haisha</a>". "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>" journalist and film critic <a href="Namrata%20Joshi">Namrata Joshi</a> included "Nil Battey Sannata" in her year-end list of "Hindi films that made a mark in 2016". She thought of it "a warm, feel-good film which offers hope and the promise".

The realism in the portrayal of the characters, and the universal theme of the film was widely lauded by critics. Gautaman Bhaskaran of "<a href="Hindustan%20Times">Hindustan Times</a>" gave it 4 stars out of 5 and remarked that the film "is a powerful and honest work", and Shubhra Gupta of "The Indian Express" noted that "the film relies on keeping things real". Mohar Basu in his review at "The Times of India" described the movie as "unpretentious", saying that "the movie wins you over with its innocence and simplicity". Saibal Chatterjee of <a href="NDTV">NDTV</a> said the film resonated as "a disarmingly simple and heart-warming film". Suparna Sharma of "<a href="Deccan%20Chronicle">Deccan Chronicle</a>" called it a "real film in a real setting about real people that delivers several empowering, powerful messages".

The performances of the lead cast were chiefly praised by critics. Joshi, who was particularly impressed with the performances of Tripathi and Shukla, ascribed the film's appeal to its well-etched characters and their relationships which were "brought alive by a nicely put together ensemble cast". The view was shared by Rachit Gupta of "<a href="Filmfare">Filmfare</a>", who noted that "the actors make this film so memorable". He gave Bhaskar the highest praise, saying that she delivered the "performance of a lifetime", while also praising Shukla's "super", Pathak's "phenomenal" and Tripathi's "masterclass" performances. In his review, <a href="CNN-News18">CNN-News18</a> film critic <a href="Rajeev%20Masand">Rajeev Masand</a> deemed Bhaskar to be "the heart of the film" noting that with "not one note out of place, she grabs your attention". Udita Jhunjhunwala of "<a href="Firstpost">Firstpost</a>" praised Bhaskar, stating that "This is one of her most nuanced performances and a welcome change", and highlighted Tripathi, calling him the "scene-stealer as the zealous school principal".

In November 2015, Iyer agreed terms to direct a remake of the film in Tamil, for producers <a href="Dhanush">Dhanush</a> and Anand L Rai. Dhanush had been shown a preview of the film by Rai, during a visit to Mumbai in September 2015 and the duo chose to co-produce the film, with Iyer retained as director. The roles played by Bhaskar, Shukla, Pathak, and Tripathi were essayed by <a href="Amala%20Paul">Amala Paul</a>, Yuvasri, <a href="Revathi">Revathi</a>, and <a href="Samuthirakani">Samuthirakani</a> respectively in the remake, titled "<a href="Amma%20Kanakku">Amma Kanakku</a>", which released on 24 June 2016.

Planet Nine

Planet Nine is a <a href="List%20of%20hypothetical%20Solar%20System%20objects">hypothetical</a> <a href="planet">planet</a> in the <a href="Solar%20System%23Trans-Neptunian%20region">outer region of the Solar System</a>. Its <a href="gravity">gravitational</a> effects could explain the unlikely clustering of <a href="orbit">orbit</a>s for a group of <a href="Extreme%20trans-Neptunian%20object">extreme trans-Neptunian objects</a> (eTNOs), bodies beyond <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a> that orbit the Sun at distances averaging more than 250 times that of the Earth. These eTNOs tend to make their closest approaches to the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> in one sector, and their orbits are similarly tilted. These improbable alignments suggest that an undiscovered planet may be shepherding the orbits of the most distant known <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> objects.

This undiscovered <a href="super-Earth">super-Earth</a>-sized planet would have a predicted mass of five to ten times the <a href="Earth">Earth</a>, and an <a href="Orbital%20eccentricity">elongated orbit</a> 400 to 800 times as far from the Sun as the Earth. <a href="Konstantin%20Batygin">Konstantin Batygin</a> and <a href="Michael%20E.%20Brown">Michael E. Brown</a> suggest that Planet Nine could be the <a href="Planetary%20core">core</a> of a <a href="giant%20planet">giant planet</a> that was ejected from its original orbit by <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> during the <a href="Nebular%20hypothesis">genesis</a> of the Solar System. Others propose that the planet was captured from another <a href="star">star</a>, was once a <a href="rogue%20planet">rogue planet</a>, or that it formed on a distant orbit and was pulled into an eccentric orbit by a passing star. 

As of 2018, no observation of Planet Nine had been announced. While sky surveys such as <a href="Wide-field%20Infrared%20Survey%20Explorer">Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer</a> (WISE) and <a href="Pan-STARRS">Pan-STARRS</a> did not detect Planet Nine, they have not ruled out the existence of a Neptune-diameter object in the outer Solar System. The ability of these past sky surveys to detect Planet Nine were dependent on its location and characteristics. Further surveys of the remaining regions are ongoing using <a href="NEOWISE">NEOWISE</a> and the 8-meter <a href="Subaru%20Telescope">Subaru Telescope</a>. Until Planet Nine is observed, it remains a hypothetical object. Several alternative theories have been proposed to explain the observed clustering of TNOs.

Following the <a href="discovery%20of%20Neptune">discovery of Neptune</a> in 1846, there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit. The best known of these theories predicted the existence of a distant planet that was influencing the orbits of <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a> and Neptune. After extensive calculations <a href="Percival%20Lowell">Percival Lowell</a> predicted the possible orbit and location of the hypothetical trans-Neptunian planet and began an extensive search for it in 1906. He called the hypothetical object "<a href="Planets%20beyond%20Neptune%23Planet%20X">Planet X</a>", a name previously used by Gabriel Dallet. After <a href="Voyager%202">Voyager 2</a>'s flyby of Neptune in 1989 the difference between Uranus' predicted and observed orbit was determined to have been due to the use of a previously inaccurate mass of Neptune.

Attempts to detect <a href="planets%20beyond%20Neptune">planets beyond Neptune</a> by indirect means such as orbital perturbation date back to before the <a href="discovery%20of%20Pluto">discovery of Pluto</a>. <a href="George%20Forbes%20%28scientist%29">George Forbes</a> was the first to postulate the existence of trans-Neptunian planets in 1880, and his work is considered similar to more recent Planet Nine theories. George Forbes proposed that there were two distant planets. One would have an average distance from the Sun, or <a href="Semi-major%20and%20semi-minor%20axes">semi-major axis</a>, of 100 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s (AU), 100 times that of the Earth. The second would have a semimajor axis of 300 AU. His proposed planets would be responsible for a clustering of the <a href="Perihelion%20and%20aphelion">aphelion</a> distances of periodic <a href="comets">comets</a> similar to that of the <a href="Comet%23Short%20period">Jupiter-family comets</a>. 

The discovery of <a href="90377%20Sedna">Sedna's</a> peculiar orbit in 2004 led to speculation that it had encountered a massive body other than one of the eight known planets. Sedna's <a href="perihelion">perihelion</a> distance of 76 AU is too large to be due to gravitational interactions with Neptune. Several authors proposed that Sedna entered this orbit after encountering an unknown planet on a distant orbit, a member of the <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> that formed with the Sun, or another star that later passed near the Solar System. The announcement in March 2014 of the discovery of a second <a href="sednoid%23Known%20members">sednoid</a> with a perihelion distance of 80 AU, , in a similar orbit led to renewed speculation that an unknown super-Earth remained in the distant Solar System.

At a conference in 2012 Rodney Gomes proposed that an undetected planet was responsible for the orbits of some eTNOs with <a href="Detached%20object%23Orbits">detached orbits</a> and the large semi-major axis <a href="Centaur%20%28minor%20planet%29">Centaurs</a>, <a href="small%20Solar%20System%20bodies">small Solar System bodies</a> that cross the orbits of the giant planets. The proposed Neptune-massed planet would be in a distant (1500 AU), eccentric (<a href="orbital%20eccentricity">eccentricity</a> 0.4), and inclined (<a href="Orbital%20inclination">inclination</a> °) orbit. Like Planet Nine it would cause the perihelia of objects with semi-major axes greater than 300 AU to oscillate, delivering some into planet-crossing orbits and others into detached orbits like that of Sedna. In 2015 an article by Gomes, Soares, and Brasser was published detailing their arguments.

In 2014 astronomers <a href="Chad%20Trujillo">Chad Trujillo</a> and <a href="Scott%20S.%20Sheppard">Scott S. Sheppard</a> noted the similarities in the orbits of Sedna and and several other eTNOs. They proposed that an unknown planet in a circular orbit between 200 and 300 AU was perturbing their orbits. Later, in 2015, Raúl and Carlos de la Fuente Marco argued that two massive planets in <a href="orbital%20resonance">orbital resonance</a> were necessary to produce the similarities of so many orbits.

In early 2016, <a href="California%20Institute%20of%20Technology">California Institute of Technology</a>'s Batygin and Brown described how the similar orbits of six eTNOs could be explained by Planet Nine and proposed a possible orbit for the planet. This hypothesis could also explain eTNOs with orbits <a href="perpendicular">perpendicular</a> to the <a href="Solar%20System%23Inner%20planets">inner planets</a> and others with extreme inclinations, and had been offered as an explanation of the <a href="axial%20tilt">tilt</a> of the Sun's <a href="Rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis">axis</a>.

Planet Nine is hypothesized to follow an <a href="elliptical%20orbit">elliptical orbit</a> around the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> with an eccentricity of to . The planet's <a href="semi-major%20axis">semi-major axis</a> is estimated to be to , roughly 13 to 26 times the distance from Neptune to the Sun. Its inclination to the <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a>, the plane of the Earth's orbit, is projected to be to . The aphelion, or farthest point from the Sun, would be in the general direction of the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> of <a href="Taurus%20%28constellation%29">Taurus</a>, whereas the perihelion, the nearest point to the Sun, would be in the general direction of the southerly areas of <a href="Serpens">Serpens</a> (Caput), <a href="Ophiuchus">Ophiuchus</a>, and <a href="Libra%20%28constellation%29">Libra</a>. Brown thinks that if Planet Nine is confirmed to exist, a <a href="space%20probe">probe</a> could reach it in as little as 20 years by using a <a href="Oberth%20effect">powered slingshot</a> <a href="trajectory">trajectory</a> around the Sun.

The planet is estimated to have 5 to 10 times the mass of Earth. Brown thinks that if Planet Nine exists, its mass is sufficient to <a href="clearing%20the%20neighbourhood">clear its orbit</a> of large bodies in 4.6 billion years, the age of the Solar System, and that its gravity dominates the outer edge of the Solar System, which is sufficient to make it a <a href="Definition%20of%20planet%23IAU%20definition">planet by current definitions</a>. Astronomer <a href="Jean-Luc%20Margot">Jean-Luc Margot</a> has also stated that Planet Nine satisfies his criteria and would qualify as a planet if and when it is detected.

Several possible origins for Planet Nine have been examined including its ejection from the neighborhood of the known giant planets, capture from another star, and "<a href="in%20situ">in situ</a>" formation. In their initial article, Batygin and Brown proposed that Planet Nine formed closer to the Sun and was ejected into a distant eccentric orbit following a close encounter with Jupiter or <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a> during the nebular epoch. The gravity of a nearby star, or drag from the gaseous remnants of the <a href="Solar%20nebula">Solar nebula</a>, then reduced the eccentricity of its orbit. This raised its perihelion, leaving it in a very wide but stable orbit beyond the influence of the other planets. Had it not been flung into the Solar System's farthest reaches, Planet Nine could have accreted more mass from the <a href="proto-planetary%20disk">proto-planetary disk</a> and developed into the core of a <a href="gas%20giant">gas giant</a>. Instead, its growth was halted early, leaving it with a lower mass than Uranus or Neptune.

<a href="Dynamical%20friction">Dynamical friction</a> from a massive belt of <a href="planetesimal">planetesimal</a>s could also enable Planet Nine's capture in a stable orbit. Recent models propose that a 60–130 Earth mass disk of planetesimals could have formed as the gas was cleared from the outer parts of the proto-planetary disk. As Planet Nine passed through this disk its gravity would alter the paths of the individual objects in a way that reduced Planet Nine's velocity relative to it. This would lower the eccentricity of Planet Nine and stabilize its orbit. If this disk had a distant inner edge, 100–200 AU, a planet encountering Neptune would have a 20% chance of being captured in an orbit similar to that proposed for Planet Nine, with the observed clustering more likely if the inner edge is at 200 AU. Unlike the gas nebula, the planetesimal disk is likely to have been long lived, potentially allowing a later capture.

Planet Nine could have been captured from outside the Solar System during a close encounter between the Sun and another star. If a planet was in a distant orbit around this star, <a href="Euler%27s%20three-body%20problem">three-body</a> interactions during the encounter could alter the planet's path, leaving it in a stable orbit around the Sun. A planet originating in a system without Jupiter-massed planets could remain in a distant eccentric orbit for a longer time, increasing its chances of capture. The wider range of possible orbits would reduce the odds of its capture in a relatively low inclination orbit to 1–2 percent. This process could also occur with rogue planets, but the likelihood of their capture is much smaller, with only 0.05% - 0.10% being captured in orbits similar to that proposed for Planet Nine.

An encounter with another star could also alter the orbit of a distant planet, shifting it from a circular to an eccentric orbit. The "in situ" formation of a planet at this distance would require a very massive and extensive disk, or the outward drift of solids in a dissipating disk forming a narrow ring from which the planet accreted over a billion years. If a planet formed at such a great distance while the Sun was in its original cluster, the probability of it remaining bound to the Sun in a highly eccentric orbit is roughly 10%. A previous article reported that if the massive disk extended beyond 80 AU some objects scattered outward by Jupiter and Saturn would have been left in high inclination (inc > 50°), low eccentricity orbits which have not been observed.

The gravitational influence of Planet Nine would explain four peculiarities of the Solar System:

Planet Nine was initially proposed to explain the clustering of orbits, via a mechanism that would also explain the high perihelia of objects like Sedna. Of Planet Nine's other effects, one was unexpected, the perpendicular orbits, and the other two were found after further analysis. Although other mechanisms have been offered for many of these peculiarities, the gravitational influence of Planet Nine is the only one that explains all four. However, the gravity of Planet Nine would also increase the inclinations of other objects that cross its orbit, leaving the <a href="Comet%23Short%20period">short-period comets</a> with a broader inclination distribution than is observed. Previously Planet Nine was hypothesized to be responsible for the 6 degree tilt of the Sun's axis relative to the orbits of the planets. Recent updates to its predicted orbit and mass limit this shift to ~1 degree.

The clustering of the orbits of TNOs with large semi-major axes was first described by Trujillo and Sheppard, who noted similarities between the orbits of Sedna and . Without the presence of Planet Nine, these orbits should be distributed randomly, without preference for any direction. Upon further analysis, Trujillo and Sheppard observed that the <a href="argument%20of%20perihelion">arguments of perihelion</a> of 12 TNOs with perihelia greater than and semi-major axes greater than were clustered near zero degrees, meaning that they rise through the ecliptic when they are closest to the sun. Trujillo and Sheppard proposed that this alignment was caused by a massive unknown planet beyond Neptune via the <a href="Kozai%20mechanism">Kozai mechanism</a>. For objects with similar semi-major axes the Kozai mechanism would confine their arguments of perihelion to near 0 or 180 degrees. This confinement allows objects with eccentric and inclined orbits to avoid close approaches to the planet because they would cross the plane of the planet's orbit at their closest and farthest points from the Sun, and cross the planet's orbit when they are well above or below its orbit. Trujillo and Sheppard's hypothesis about how the objects would be aligned by the Kozai mechanism has been supplanted by further analysis and evidence.

Batygin and Brown, looking to refute the mechanism proposed by Trujillo and Sheppard, also examined the orbits of the TNOs with large semi-major axes. After eliminating the objects in Trujillo and Sheppard's original analysis that were unstable due to close approaches to Neptune or were affected by Neptune's <a href="mean-motion%20resonance">mean-motion resonance</a>s, Batygin and Brown determined that the arguments of perihelion for the remaining six objects (Sedna, , , , , and ) were clustered around . This finding did not agree with how the Kozai mechanism would tend to align orbits with arguments of perihelion at 0° or 180°.

Batygin and Brown also found that the orbits of the six eTNOs with semi-major axes greater than 250 AU and perihelia beyond 30 AU (Sedna, , , , , and ) were aligned in space with their perihelia in roughly the same direction, resulting in a clustering of their <a href="longitude%20of%20perihelion">longitudes of perihelion</a>, the location where they make their closest approaches to the Sun. The orbits of the six objects were also tilted with respect to that of the <a href="Ecliptic%23Plane%20of%20the%20Solar%20System">ecliptic</a> and approximately <a href="coplanarity">coplanar</a>, producing a clustering of their <a href="longitude%20of%20ascending%20node">longitudes of ascending nodes</a>, the directions where they each rise through the ecliptic. They determined that there was only a 0.007% likelihood that this combination of alignments was due to chance. These six objects had been discovered by six different surveys on six different telescopes. That made it less likely that the clumping might be due to an observation bias such as pointing a telescope at a particular part of the sky. The observed clustering should be smeared out in a few hundred million years due to the locations of the perihelia and the ascending nodes changing, or <a href="Precession%23Astronomy">precessing</a>, at differing rates due to their varied semi-major axes and eccentricities. \frac{1}{(1-e^2)^2}\sum_{k=5}^8 \frac{m_k a_k^2}{M a^2}cos^2(i)</math>
where formula_1 are the masses and semi-major axes of the planets Jupiter through Neptune.}} This indicates that the clustering could not be due to an event in the distant past, such as a passing star, and is most likely maintained by the gravitational field of an object orbiting the Sun.

Two of the six objects ( and ) also have very similar orbits and spectra. This has led to the suggestion that they were a <a href="binary%20asteroid">binary object</a> disrupted near aphelion during an encounter with a distant object. The disruption of a binary would require a relatively close encounter, which becomes less likely at large distances from the Sun.

In a later article Trujillo and Sheppard noted a correlation between the longitude of perihelion and the argument of perihelion of the TNOs with semi-major axes greater than 150 AU. Those with a longitude of perihelion of 0–120° have arguments of perihelion between 280–360°, and those with longitude of perihelion between ° and ° have arguments of perihelion between ° and °. The statistical significance of this correlation was 99.99%. They suggested that the correlation is due to the orbits of these objects avoiding close approaches to a massive planet by passing above or below its orbit.

A 2017 article by Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos noted that distribution of the distances to the ascending nodes of the eTNOs, and those of centaurs and comets with large semi-major axes, may be <a href="bimodal">bimodal</a>. They suggest it is due to the eTNOs avoiding close approaches to a planet with a semi-major axis of 300–400 AU. 

The clustering of the orbits of eTNOs and raising of their perihelia is reproduced in simulations that include Planet Nine. In simulations conducted by Batygin and Brown, swarms of objects with large semi-major axes that began with random orientations were sculpted into roughly <a href="collinear">collinear</a> and coplanar groups of spatially confined orbits by a massive distant planet in a highly eccentric orbit. The objects perihelia tended to point in the same direction and the objects orbits tended to align in the same plane. Many of these objects entered high perihelion orbits like Sedna and, unexpectedly, some entered perpendicular orbits that Batygin and Brown later noticed had been previously observed.

In their original analysis Batygin and Brown found that the distribution of the orbits of the first six eTNOs was best reproduced in simulations using a 10 Earth mass planet in the following orbit:

These parameters for Planet Nine produce different simulated effects on TNOs. Objects with semi-major axis greater than 250 AU are strongly anti-aligned with Planet Nine, with perihelia opposite Planet Nine's perihelion. Objects with semi-major axes between 150 AU and 250 AU are weakly aligned with Planet Nine, with perihelia in the same direction as Planet Nine's perihelion. Little effect is found on objects with semi-major axes less than 150 AU. The simulations also revealed that objects with semimajor axis greater than could have stable, aligned orbits if they had lower eccentricities. These objects have yet to be observed.

Other possible orbits for Planet Nine were also examined, with semi-major axes between and , eccentricites up to 0.8, and a wide range of inclinations. These orbits yield varied results. Batygin and Brown found that orbits of the eTNOs were more likely have similar tilts if Planet Nine had a higher inclination, but anti-alignment also decreased. Simulations by Becker et al. showed that their orbits were more stable if Planet Nine had a smaller eccentricity, but that anti-alignment was more likely at higher eccentricities. Lawler et al. found that the population captured in orbital resonances with Planet Nine was smaller if it had a circular orbit, and that fewer objects reached high inclination orbits. Investigations by Cáceres et al. showed that the orbits of the eTNOs were better aligned if Planet Nine had a lower perihelion orbit, but its perihelion would need to be higher than 90 AU. Later investigations by Batygin et al. found that higher eccentricity orbits reduced the average tilts of the eTNOs orbits. While there are many possible combinations of orbital parameters and masses for Planet Nine, none of the alternative simulations have been better at predicting the observed alignment of objects in the Solar System. The discovery of additional distant Solar System objects would allow astronomers to make more accurate predictions about the orbit of the hypothesized planet. These may also provide further support for, or refutation of, the Planet Nine hypothesis.

Planet Nine modifies the orbits of eTNOs via a combination of effects. On very long timescales Planet Nine exerts a <a href="torque">torque</a> on the orbits of the eTNOs that varies with the alignment of their orbits with Planet Nine's. The resulting exchanges of <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momentum</a> cause the perihelia to rise, placing them in Sedna-like orbits, and later fall, returning them to their original orbits after several hundred million years. The motion of their directions of perihelion also reverses when their eccentricities are small, keeping the objects anti-aligned, see blue curves on diagram, or aligned, red curves. On shorter timescales mean-motion resonances with Planet Nine provides phase protection, which stabilizes their orbits by slightly altering the objects' semi-major axes, keeping their orbits synchronized with Planet Nine's and preventing close approaches. The gravity of Neptune and the other giant planets, and the inclination of Planet Nine's orbit, weaken this protection. This results in a <a href="Chaos%20theory">chaotic</a> variation of semi-major axes as objects hop between resonances, including high order resonances such as 27:17, on million-year timescales. The mean-motion resonances may not be necessary for the survival of eTNOs if they and Planet Nine are both on inclined orbits. The orbital poles of the objects precess around, or circle, the pole of the Solar System's <a href="Laplace%20plane">Laplace plane</a>. At large semi-major axes the Laplace plane is warped toward the plane of Planet Nine's orbit. This causes orbital poles of the eTNOs on average to be tilted toward one side and their longitudes of ascending nodes to be clustered.

Planet Nine can deliver eTNOs into orbits roughly perpendicular to the ecliptic. Several objects with high inclinations, greater than 50°, and large semi-major axes, above 250 AU, have been observed. These orbits are produced when some low inclination eTNOs enter a <a href="secular%20resonance">secular resonance</a> with Planet Nine upon reaching low eccentricity orbits. The resonance causes their eccentricities and inclinations to increase, delivering the eTNOs into perpendicular orbits with low perihelia where they are more readily observed. The eTNOs then evolve into <a href="Retrograde%20and%20prograde%20motion">retrograde</a> orbits with lower eccentricities, after which they pass through a second phase of high eccentricity perpendicular orbits, before returning to low eccentricity and inclination orbits. The secular resonance with Planet Nine involves a <a href="linear%20combination">linear combination</a> of the orbit's arguments and longitudes of perihelion: Δϖ - 2ω. Unlike the Kozai mechanism this resonance causes objects to reach their maximum eccentricities when in nearly perpendicular orbits. In simulations conducted by Batygin and Morbidelli this evolution was relatively common, with 38% of stable objects undergoing it at least once. The arguments of perihelion of these objects are clustered near or opposite Planet Nine's and their longitudes of ascending node are clustered around 90° in either direction from Planet Nine's when they reach low perihelia. This is in rough agreement with observations with the differences attributed to distant encounters with the known giant planets.

A population of high inclination TNOs with semi-major axes less than 100 AU may be generated by the combined effects of Planet Nine and the other giant planets. The eTNOs that enter perpendicular orbits have perihelia low enough for their orbits to intersect those of Neptune or the other giant planets. An encounter with one of these planets can lower an eTNO's semi-major axis to below 100 AU, where the object's orbits is no longer controlled by Planet Nine, leaving it on orbits like . The predicted orbital distribution of the longest lived of these objects is nonuniform. Most would have orbits with perihelia ranging from 5 AU to 35 AU and inclinations below 110 degree; beyond a gap with few objects are would be others with inclinations near 150 degrees and perihelia near 10 AU. Previously it was proposed that these objects originated in the <a href="Oort%20Cloud">Oort Cloud</a>, a theoretical cloud of icy planetesimals surrounding the Sun at distances of 2,000 to 200,000 AU.

Planet Nine would alter the source regions and the inclination distribution of comets. In simulations of the migration of the giant planets described by the <a href="Nice%20model">Nice model</a> fewer objects are captured in the <a href="Oort%20cloud">Oort cloud</a> when Planet Nine is included. Other objects would be captured in a cloud of objects dynamically controlled by Planet Nine. This Planet Nine cloud, made up of the eTNOs and the perpendicular objects, would extend from semimajor axes of 200 AU to 3000 AU and contain roughly 0.3—0.4 Earth masses. When the perihelia of objects in the Planet Nine cloud drop low enough for them to encounter the other planets some would be scattered into orbits the enter the inner Solar System where they could be observed as comets. If Planet Nine exists these would make up roughly one third of the <a href="Comet%23Short%20period">Halley-type comets</a>. Planet Nine would also alter the orbits of the <a href="scattered%20disc">scattering disk objects</a>, those with semi-major axes greater than 50 AU and perihelia near Neptune's orbit, that cross its orbit, increasing their inclinations. This would increase the inclinations of the <a href="Comet%23Short%20period">Jupiter-family comets</a> derived from that population leaving them with a broader inclination distribution than is observed.

Batygin was cautious in interpreting the results of the simulation developed for his and Brown's research article, saying, "Until Planet Nine is caught on camera it does not count as being real. All we have now is an echo." Brown put the odds for the existence of Planet Nine at about 90%. <a href="Gregory%20P.%20Laughlin">Greg Laughlin</a>, one of the few researchers who knew in advance about this article, gives an estimate of 68.3%. Other skeptical scientists demand more data in terms of additional KBOs to be analyzed or final evidence through photographic confirmation. Brown, though conceding the skeptics' point, still thinks that there is enough data to mount a search for a new planet.

The Planet Nine hypothesis is supported by several astronomers and academics. <a href="James%20L.%20Green">Jim Green</a>, director of NASA's <a href="Science%20Mission%20Directorate">Science Mission Directorate</a>, said, "the evidence is stronger now than it's been before". But Green also cautioned about the possibility of other explanations for the observed motion of distant eTNOs and, quoting <a href="Carl%20Sagan">Carl Sagan</a>, he said, "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence." <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> Professor <a href="Thomas%20Levenson">Tom Levenson</a> concluded that, for now, Planet Nine seems the only satisfactory explanation for everything now known about the outer regions of the Solar System. Astronomer <a href="Alessandro%20Morbidelli%20%28astronomer%29">Alessandro Morbidelli</a>, who reviewed the research article for "<a href="The%20Astronomical%20Journal">The Astronomical Journal</a>", concurred, saying, "I don't see any alternative explanation to that offered by Batygin and Brown."

Astronomer <a href="Renu%20Malhotra">Renu Malhotra</a> remains agnostic about Planet Nine, but noted that she and her colleagues have found that the orbits of eTNOs seem tilted in a way that is difficult to otherwise explain. "The amount of warp we see is just crazy," she said. "To me, it's the most intriguing evidence for Planet Nine I've run across so far."

Other authorities have varying degrees of skepticism. American astrophysicist <a href="Ethan%20Siegel">Ethan Siegel</a>, who previously speculated that planets may have been ejected from the Solar System during an early dynamical instability, is skeptical of the existence of an undiscovered planet in the Solar System. In a recent article discussing a survey that did not find evidence of clustering of the ETNO's orbits he suggests the previously observed clustering could have been the result of observing bias and claims most scientists think Planet Nine does not exist. Planetary scientist <a href="Harold%20F.%20Levison">Hal Levison</a> thinks that the chance of an ejected object ending up in the inner Oort cloud is only about 2%, and speculates that many objects must have been thrown past the Oort cloud if one has entered a stable orbit.

The results of the Outer Solar System Survey (OSSOS) suggest that the observed clustering is the result of a combination of observing bias and small number statistics. OSSOS, a well-characterized survey of the outer Solar System with known biases, observed eight objects with semi-major axis > 150 AU with orbits oriented on a wide range of directions. After accounting for the observational biases of the survey, no evidence for the arguments of perihelion (ω) clustering identified by Trujillo and Sheppard was seen, and the orientation of the orbits of the objects with the largest semi-major axis was statistically consistent with random. This result differed from an analysis of discovery biases in the previously observed eTNOs by Mike Brown. He found that after observing biases were accounted for the clustering of longitudes of perihelion of 10 known eTNOs would be observed only 1.2% of the time if their actual distribution was uniform. When combined with the odds of the observed clustering of the arguments of perihelion the probability was 0.025%. A later analysis of the discovery biases of 14 eTNOs by Brown and Batygin found a probability of the observed clustering of the longitudes of perihelion and the orbital pole locations of 0.2%.

Simulations of 15 known objects evolving under the influence of Planet Nine also revealed differences with observations. Cory Shankman and his colleagues included Planet Nine in a simulation of many clones (objects with similar orbits) of 15 objects with semi-major axis > 150 AU and perihelion > 30 AU. While they observed alignment of the orbits opposite that of Planet Nine's for the objects with semi-major axis greater than 250 AU, clustering of the arguments of perihelion was not seen. Their simulations also showed that the perihelia of the eTNOs rose and fell smoothly, leaving many with perihelion distances between 50 AU and 70 AU where none had been observed, and predicted that there would be many other unobserved objects. These included a large reservoir of high-inclination objects that would have been missed due to most observations being at small inclinations, and a large population of objects with perihelia so distant that they would be too faint to observe. Many of the objects were also ejected from the Solar System after encountering the other giant planets. The large unobserved populations and the loss of many objects led Shankman et al. to estimate that the mass of the original population was tens of Earth masses, requiring that a much larger mass had been ejected during the early Solar System. Shankman et al. concluded that the existence of Planet Nine is unlikely and that the currently observed alignment of the existing eTNOs is a temporary phenomenon that will disappear as more objects are detected.

Ann-Marie Madigan and Michael McCourt postulate that an <a href="inclination%20instability">inclination instability</a> in a distant massive belt is responsible for the alignment of the arguments of perihelion of the eTNOs. An inclination instability could occur in a disk of particles with high eccentricity orbits (e>0.6) around a central body, such as the Sun. The self-gravity of this disk would cause its spontaneous organization, increasing the inclinations of the objects and aligning the arguments of perihelion, forming it into a cone above or below the original plane. This process would require an extended time and significant mass of the disk, on the order of a billion years for a 1–10 Earth-mass disk. While an inclination instability could align the arguments of perihelion and raise perihelia, producing detached objects, it would not align the longitudes of perihelion. Mike Brown considers Planet Nine a more probable explanation, noting that current surveys have not revealed a large enough scattered-disk to produce an "inclination instability". In Nice model simulations of the Solar System that included the self-gravity of the planetesimal disk an inclination instability did not occur. Instead, the simulation produced a rapid precession of the objects' orbits and most of the objects were ejected on too short of a timescale for an inclination instability to occur.

Antranik Sefilian and Jihad Touma propose that a massive disk of moderately eccentric TNOs is responsible for the clustering of the longitudes of perihelion of the eTNOs. Their predicted 10 Earth-mass disk would contain TNOs with aligned orbits and eccentricities that increased with their semimajor axes ranging from zero to 0.165. The gravitational effects of this disk would offset the forward precession driven by the giant planets so that the orbital orientations of its individual objects are maintained. The orbits of objects with high eccentricities, such as the observed eTNOs, would be stable and have roughly fixed orientations, or longitudes of perihelion, if their orbits were anti-aligned with this disk. Although Brown thinks the proposed disk could explain the observed clustering of the eTNOs he finds it implausible that the disk could survive over the age of the Solar System. Batygin thinks that there is insufficient mass in the Kuiper belt to explain the formation of the disk and asks "why would the protoplanetary disk end near 30 AU and restart beyond 100 AU."

The Planet Nine hypothesis includes a set of predictions about the mass and orbit of the planet. An alternative theory predicts a planet with different orbital parameters. Malhotra, Kathryn Volk, and Xianyu Wang have proposed that the four detached objects with the longest orbital periods, those with perihelia beyond and semi-major axes greater than , are in "n":1 or "n":2 mean-motion resonances with a hypothetical planet. Two other objects with semi-major axes greater than are also potentially in resonance with this planet. Their proposed planet could be on a lower eccentricity, low inclination orbit, with eccentricity "e" < 0.18 and inclination "i" ≈ 11°. The eccentricity is limited in this case by the requirement that close approaches of to the planet are avoided. If the eTNOs are in periodic orbits of the third kind, with their stability enhanced by the libration of their arguments of perihelion, the planet could be in a higher inclination orbit, with "i" ≈ 48°. Unlike Batygin and Brown, Malhotra, Volk and Wang do not specify that most of the distant detached objects would have orbits anti-aligned with the massive planet.

Trujillo and Sheppard argued in 2014 that a massive planet in a circular orbit with an average distance between and was responsible for the clustering of the arguments of perihelion of twelve TNOs with large semi-major axes. Trujillo and Sheppard identified a clustering near zero degrees of the arguments of perihelion of the orbits of twelve TNOs with perihelia greater than and semi-major axes greater than . After numerical simulations showed that the arguments of perihelion should circulate at varying rates, leaving them randomized after billions of years, they suggested that a massive planet in a circular orbit at a few hundred astronomical units was responsible for this clustering. This massive planet would cause the arguments of perihelion of the TNOs to librate about 0° or 180° via the Kozai mechanism so that their orbits crossed the plane of the planet's orbit near perihelion and aphelion, the closest and farthest points from the planet. In numerical simulations including a 2–15 Earth mass body in a circular low-inclination orbit between and the arguments of perihelia of Sedna and librated around 0° for billions of years (although the lower perihelion objects did not) and underwent periods of libration with a Neptune mass object in a high inclination orbit at 1,500 AU. Another process such as a passing star would be required to account for the absence of objects with arguments of perihelion near 180°.

These simulations showed the basic idea of how a single large planet can shepherd the smaller TNOs into similar types of orbits. They were basic proof of concept simulations that did not obtain a unique orbit for the planet as they state there are many possible orbital configurations the planet could have. Thus they did not fully formulate a model that successfully incorporated all the clustering of the eTNOs with an orbit for the planet. But they were the first to notice there was a clustering in the orbits of TNOs and that the most likely reason was from an unknown massive distant planet. Their work is very similar to how <a href="Alexis%20Bouvard">Alexis Bouvard</a> noticed Uranus' motion was peculiar and suggested that it was likely gravitational forces from an unknown 8th planet, which led to the discovery of Neptune.

Raúl and Carlos de la Fuente Marcos proposed a similar model but with two distant planets in resonance. An analysis by Carlos and Raúl de la Fuente Marcos with <a href="Sverre%20Aarseth">Sverre J. Aarseth</a> confirmed that the observed alignment of the arguments of perihelion could not be due to observational bias. They speculated that instead it was caused by an object with a mass between that of Mars and Saturn that orbited at some from the Sun. Like Trujillo and Sheppard they theorized that the TNOs are kept bunched together by a Kozai mechanism and compared their behavior to that of <a href="96P/Machholz">Comet 96P/Machholz</a> under the influence of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. They also struggled to explain the orbital alignment using a model with only one unknown planet, and therefore suggested that this planet is itself in resonance with a more-massive world about from the Sun. In their article, Brown and Batygin noted that alignment of arguments of perihelion near 0° or 180° via the Kozai mechanism requires a ratio of the semi-major axes nearly equal to one, indicating that multiple planets with orbits tuned to the data set would be required, making this explanation too unwieldy.

Due to its extreme distance from the Sun, Planet Nine would reflect little sunlight, potentially evading telescope sightings. It is expected to have an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> fainter than 22, making it at least 600 times fainter than <a href="Pluto">Pluto</a>. If Planet Nine exists and is close to perihelion, astronomers could identify it based on existing images. At aphelion, the largest telescopes would be required, but if the planet is currently located in between, many <a href="observatory">observatories</a> could spot Planet Nine. Statistically, the planet is more likely to be closer to its aphelion at a distance greater than 600 AU. This is because objects move more slowly when near their aphelion, in accordance with <a href="Kepler%27s%20second%20law">Kepler's second law</a>.

The search of <a href="Star%20catalogue">databases of stellar objects</a> by Batygin and Brown has already excluded much of the sky along Planet Nine's predicted orbit. The remaining regions include the direction of its aphelion, where it would be too faint to be spotted by these surveys, and near the plane of the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>, where it would be difficult to distinguish from the numerous stars. This search included the archival data from the <a href="Catalina%20Sky%20Survey">Catalina Sky Survey</a> to magnitude c. 19, <a href="Pan-STARRS">Pan-STARRS</a> to magnitude 21.5, and infrared data from the <a href="Wide-field%20Infrared%20Survey%20Explorer">Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer</a> (WISE) satellite.

Other researchers have been conducting searches of existing data. David Gerdes, who helped develop the camera used in the <a href="Dark%20Energy%20Survey">Dark Energy Survey</a>, claims that software designed to identify distant Solar System objects such as could find Planet Nine if it was imaged as part of that survey, which covered a quarter of the southern sky. Michael Medford and Danny Goldstein, graduate students at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>, are also examining archived data using a technique that combines images taken at different times. Using a <a href="supercomputer">supercomputer</a> they will offset the images to account for the calculated motion of Planet Nine, allowing many faint images of a faint moving object to be combined to produce a brighter image. A search combining multiple images collected by WISE and NEOWISE data has also been conducted without detecting Planet Nine. This search covered regions of the sky away from the galactic plane at the "W1" wavelength (the 3.4 μm wavelength used by WISE) and is estimated to be able to detect a 10-Earth mass object out to 800–900 AU.

Because the planet is predicted to be visible in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, the primary search is expected to be carried out using the <a href="Subaru%20Telescope">Subaru Telescope</a>, which has both an <a href="Objective%20%28optics%29">aperture</a> large enough to see faint objects and a wide field of view to shorten the search. Two teams of astronomers—Batygin and Brown, as well as Trujillo and Sheppard—are undertaking this search together, and both teams expect the search to take up to five years. Brown and Batygin initially narrowed the search for Planet Nine down to roughly 2,000 <a href="square%20degree">square degree</a>s of sky near <a href="Orion%20%28constellation%29">Orion</a>, a swath of space that Batygin thinks could be covered in about 20 nights by the Subaru Telescope. Subsequent refinements by Batygin and Brown have reduced the search space to 600–800 square degrees of sky. In December 2018, they spent 4 half–nights and 3 full nights observing with the Subaru Telescope.

Although a distant planet such as Planet Nine would reflect little light, it would still be radiating the heat from its formation as it cools due to its large mass. At its estimated temperature of the peak of its emissions would be at <a href="infrared">infrared</a> wavelengths. This radiation signature could be detected by Earth-based <a href="submillimeter%20telescope">submillimeter telescope</a>s, such as <a href="Atacama%20Large%20Millimeter%20Array">ALMA</a>, and a search could be conducted by <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background">cosmic microwave background</a> experiments operating at <a href="Microwave%23Radio_astronomy">mm wavelengths</a>. Jim Green of NASA's Science Mission Directorate is optimistic that it could be observed by the "<a href="James%20Webb%20Space%20Telescope%23Infrared%20astronomy">James Webb Space Telescope</a>", the successor to the "<a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a>", that is expected to be launched in 2021.

The Zooniverse project, started in February 2017, is using archival data from the WISE spacecraft to search for Planet Nine. The project will also search for substellar objects like <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a>s in the neighborhood of the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>. 32,000 animations of four images each, which constitute 3 per cent of the WISE data, have been uploaded to the Backyard Worlds website. By looking for moving objects in the animations, citizen scientists might find Planet Nine.
In April 2017, using data from the <a href="SkyMapper">SkyMapper</a> telescope at <a href="Siding%20Spring%20Observatory">Siding Spring Observatory</a>, <a href="citizen%20scientist">citizen scientist</a>s on the <a href="Zooniverse">Zooniverse</a> platform reported four candidates for Planet Nine. These candidates will be followed up on by astronomers to determine their viability. The project, which started on 28 March 2017, completed their goals in less than three days with around five million classifications by more than 60,000 individuals.

Precise observations of Saturn's orbit using data from <a href="Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens">"Cassini"</a> suggest that Planet Nine could not be in certain sections of its proposed orbit because its gravity would cause a noticeable effect on Saturn's position. This data neither proves nor disproves that Planet Nine exists.

An initial analysis by Fienga, Laskar, Manche, and Gastineau using Cassini data to search for Saturn's orbital residuals, small differences with its predicted orbit due to the Sun and the known planets, was inconsistent with Planet Nine being located with a <a href="true%20anomaly">true anomaly</a>, the location along its orbit relative to perihelion, of −130° to −110° or −65° to 85°. The analysis, using Batygin and Brown's orbital parameters for Planet Nine, suggests that the lack of perturbations to Saturn's orbit is best explained if Planet Nine is located at a true anomaly of . At this location, Planet Nine would be approximately from the Sun, with <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> close to 2 and <a href="declination">declination</a> close to −20°, in Cetus. In contrast, if the putative planet is near aphelion it would be located near right ascension 3.0 to 5.5 and declination −1° to 6°.

An later analysis of "Cassini" data by astrophysicists Matthew Holman and Matthew Payne tightened the constraints on possible locations of Planet Nine. Holman and Payne developed a more efficient model that allowed them to explore a broader range of parameters than the previous analysis. The parameters identified using this technique to analyze the Cassini data was then intersected with Batygin and Brown's dynamical constraints on Planet Nine's orbit. Holman and Payne concluded that Planet Nine is most likely to be located within 20° of RA = 40°, Dec = −15°, in an area of the sky near the constellation Cetus.

William Folkner, a planetary scientist at <a href="Jet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) has stated that the "Cassini" spacecraft is not experiencing unexplained deviations in its orbit around Saturn. An undiscovered planet would affect the orbit of Saturn, not "Cassini". This could produce a signature in the measurements of "Cassini", but JPL has seen no unexplained signatures in "Cassini" data.

An analysis in 2016 of Pluto's orbit by Holman and Payne found perturbations much larger than predicted by Batygin and Brown's proposed orbit for Planet Nine. Holman and Payne suggested three possible explanations: systematic errors in the measurements of Pluto's orbit; an unmodeled mass in the Solar System, such as a small planet in the range of 60– (potentially explaining the <a href="Kuiper%20cliff">Kuiper cliff</a>); or a planet more massive or closer to the Sun instead of the planet predicted by Batygin and Brown.

An analysis of the orbits of comets with nearly <a href="parabolic%20orbit">parabolic orbit</a>s identifies five new comets with <a href="hyperbolic%20orbit">hyperbolic orbit</a>s that approach the nominal orbit of Planet Nine described in Batygin and Brown's initial article. If these orbits are hyperbolic due to close encounters with Planet Nine the analysis estimates that Planet Nine is currently near aphelion with a right ascension of 83–90° and a declination of 8–10°. Scott Sheppard, who is skeptical of this analysis, notes that many different forces influence the orbits of comets.

An analysis by Sarah Millholland and Gregory Laughlin identified a pattern of <a href="Commensurability%20%28astronomy%29">commensurabilities</a> (ratios between orbital periods of pairs of objects consistent with both being in resonance with another object) of the eTNOs. They identify five objects that would be near resonances with Planet Nine if had a semi-major axis of 654 AU: Sedna (3:2), (3:1), (4:1), (5:1), and (5:1). They identify this planet as Planet Nine but propose a different orbit with an eccentricity "e" ≈ 0.5, inclination "i" ≈ 30°, argument of perihelion ω ≈ 150°, and longitude of ascending node Ω ≈ 50° (the last differs from Brown and Batygin's value of 90°).

Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos also note commensurabilities among the known eTNOs similar to that of the Kuiper belt, where accidental commensurabilities occur due to objects in resonances with Neptune. They find that some of these objects would be in 5:3 and 3:1 resonances with a planet that had a semi-major axis of ≈700 AU.

Three objects with smaller semi-major axes near 172 AU (2013 UH15 2016 QV89 and 2016 QU89) have also been proposed to be in resonance with Planet Nine. These objects would be in resonance and anti-aligned with Planet Nine if it had a semi-major axis of 315 AU, below the range proposed by Batygin and Brown. Alternatively, they could be in resonance with Planet Nine, but have orbital orientations that circulate instead of being confined by Planet Nine if it had a semi-major axis of 505 AU. 

A later analysis by Elizabeth Bailey, Michael Brown and Konstantin Batygin found that if Planet Nine is in an eccentric and inclined orbit the capture of many of the eTNOs in higher order resonances and their chaotic transfer between resonances prevent the identification of Planet Nine's semi-major axis using current observations. They also determined that the odds of the first six objects observed being in N/1 or N/2 period ratios with Planet Nine are less than 5% if it has an eccentric orbit.

Planet Nine does not have an official name and will not receive one unless its existence is confirmed via imaging. Only two planets, Uranus and Neptune, have been discovered in recorded history. However, a great many <a href="minor%20planets">minor planets</a>, including <a href="dwarf%20planets">dwarf planets</a>, and <a href="asteroids">asteroids</a>, and comets have been discovered and named. Consequently, there is a well-established process for naming newly discovered solar system objects. If Planet Nine is observed, the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> will certify a name, with priority usually given to a name proposed by its discoverers. It is likely to be a name chosen from <a href="Roman%20mythology">Roman</a> or <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>.

In their original article, Batygin and Brown simply referred to the object as "perturber", and only in later press releases did they use "Planet Nine". They have also used the names "<a href="Jehoshaphat">Jehoshaphat</a>" and "George" for Planet Nine. Brown has stated: "We actually call it <a href="wikt%3Aphattie">Phattie</a> when we're just talking to each other."

In 2018, planetary scientist <a href="Alan%20Stern">Alan Stern</a> objected to the name "Planet Nine", saying, "It is an effort to erase <a href="Clyde%20Tombaugh">Clyde Tombaugh</a>'s legacy [the discovery of Pluto] and it's frankly insulting", suggesting the name Planet X until its discovery. A statement was signed by 35 scientists saying, "We further believe the use of this term [Planet Nine] should be discontinued in favor of culturally and <a href="Taxonomy%20%28general%29">taxonomically</a> neutral terms for such planets, such as Planet X, Planet Next, or Giant Planet Five." According to Brown, Planet X' is not a generic reference to some unknown planet, but a specific prediction of Lowell's which led to the (accidental) discovery of Pluto. Our prediction is not related to this prediction."

Spalding War Memorial

Spalding War Memorial is a <a href="First%20World%20War%20memorial">First World War memorial</a> in the gardens of <a href="Ayscoughfee%20Hall">Ayscoughfee Hall</a> (pronounced ) in <a href="Spalding%2C%20Lincolnshire">Spalding</a>, <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>, in eastern England. It was designed by the architect <a href="Sir%20Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>. The proposal for a memorial to Spalding's war dead originated in January 1918 with <a href="Barbara%20McLaren">Barbara McLaren</a>, whose husband and the town's Member of Parliament, <a href="Francis%20McLaren">Francis McLaren</a>, was killed in a flying accident during the war. She engaged Lutyens via a family connection and the architect produced a plan for a grand memorial <a href="cloister">cloister</a> surrounding a circular pond, in the middle of which would be a cross. The memorial was to be built in the formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local district council. When McLaren approached the council with her proposal, it generated considerable debate within the community and several alternative schemes were suggested. After a public meeting and a vote in 1919, a reduced-scale version of McLaren's proposal emerged as the preferred option, in conjunction with a clock on the town's corn exchange building.

The total cost of the memorial was £3,500, of which McLaren and her father-in-law contributed £1,000 each; her brother-in-law donated a pair of painted stone flags and the remainder was raised from voluntary subscription, which took until 1922. The memorial consists of a brick pavilion at the south end of the garden and a <a href="Stone%20of%20Remembrance">Stone of Remembrance</a>, both at the head of a long <a href="reflecting%20pool">reflecting pool</a>, which incorporates the remains of an 18th-century canal. It was unveiled at a ceremony on 9 June 1922. Lutyens went on to use the style of the pavilion for shelter buildings in several war cemeteries on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, though none of his other war memorials follow the design and the memorial became relatively obscure. Spalding War Memorial is today a grade I <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>, having been upgraded when Lutyens' war memorials were declared a "national collection" and all were granted listed building status or had their listing renewed.

War memorials became a common sight in British towns and cities following the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> (1914–1918). Almost one million men from Britain were killed in the conflict, and monuments were erected in virtually every settlement in the country. The memorial raised in <a href="Spalding%2C%20Lincolnshire">Spalding</a>, a town in southern <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a> in eastern England, was designed by the architect Sir <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Edwin Lutyens</a>, who had previously established his reputation designing <a href="country%20house">country house</a>s for wealthy clients. From 1917 onwards, Lutyens dedicated much of his time to the memorialisation of the war dead, first advising the <a href="Imperial%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Imperial War Graves Commission</a> (IWGC) and later designing war memorials both for the commission and through his own practice. Spalding was one of his first war memorial commissions.

The proposal for the Spalding war memorial originated with <a href="Barbara%20McLaren">Barbara McLaren</a> (née Jekyll). Barbara was the widow of <a href="Francis%20McLaren">Francis McLaren</a>—Spalding's Member of Parliament and a <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> officer, who was killed in a flying accident near <a href="RAF%20Montrose">RAF Montrose</a> in 1917—and the niece of garden designer <a href="Gertrude%20Jekyll">Gertrude Jekyll</a>, with whom Lutyens had collaborated on multiple previous projects. Lutyens designed the McLarens' London house on Cowley Street in Westminster in 1911 and shortly after Francis' death in 1917 designed the headstone for his grave in <a href="Busbridge">Busbridge</a> in <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>. He was later responsible for <a href="Busbridge%20War%20Memorial">the war memorial</a> in the same village.

Barbara McLaren engaged Lutyens to design a memorial for the gardens of <a href="Ayscoughfee%20Hall">Ayscoughfee Hall</a>, which Spalding Urban District Council had purchased in 1897 to celebrate the <a href="Diamond%20Jubilee%20of%20Queen%20Victoria">Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria</a>. Lutyens proposed a U-shaped cloister sheltering a Stone of Remembrance standing in front of a circular lily pool, in the centre of which would be a cross. McLaren hoped to include space for the families of those commemorated to add their own <a href="epitaph">epitaph</a>s but this proved impractical due to the amount of space that would have been required; she insisted that her husband not receive any special commemoration beyond that afforded to the other casualties.
McLaren approached the council with her proposal in January 1918. When it became public after the end of the war, the proposed scheme proved controversial, prompting debate within the community and on the letters pages of the local newspaper. Multiple alternative proposals were submitted, including both purely commemorative schemes such as a clock on the town's corn exchange building and functional schemes such as the conversion of Ayscoughfee Hall into a youth centre. The youth centre and Lutyens' proposal emerged as the leaders, and details of both were published in the local newspaper. The district council called a public meeting to debate the proposals, which was held on 1 August 1919. Around 300 people attended the meeting, at which the proponents of the two leading options plus a third proposal—the clock on the corn exchange—were allowed fifteen minutes each to outline their scheme. During the meeting, several other proposals were put forward, including a <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a> or an obelisk in the market place. The meeting was closed with the decision to hold a public vote, which was held on 23 August. The ballot paper included seven options, with each voter selecting a single choice:
The modified McLaren–Lutyens proposal emerged the clear winner, receiving 459 votes. The unmodified scheme was the second most popular option with 286 votes; the proposal for an obelisk and clock was the only other option to garner more than 200 votes.

In September 1919, the Spalding War and Victory Memorials Committee was formed to oversee fundraising and construction of the memorial, the total cost of which was £3,500. McLaren and her father-in-law <a href="Charles%20McLaren%2C%201st%20Baron%20Aberconway">Charles McLaren, 1st Baron Aberconway</a> contributed £1,000 each, Sir Herbert and Dame <a href="Agnes%20Jekyll">Agnes Jekyll</a> donated £100, <a href="Henry%20McLaren%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Aberconway">Henry McLaren</a> (Barbara's brother-in-law) donated the stone flags, and the remainder was raised by public subscription, which took until 1922.
The clock and <a href="carillon">carillon</a> (bell tower) of 23 bells was erected in 1922, the same year as Lutyens' memorial, on the corn exchange in the town centre. Three of the bells were inscribed with names of casualties from the war, chosen to represent all of Spalding's war dead, while others were inscribed with names of those involved in the commemorations. The corn exchange was demolished in 1972 and replaced with the South Holland Centre, an arts venue, with the clock and carillon re-housed in a tower on the roof. After refurbishment of the South Holland Centre in 1998, a new glass tower was built to house the clock and carillon after the bells were cleaned. On <a href="Armistice%20Day">Armistice Day</a> (11 November) 1998, the <a href="Western%20Front%20Association">Western Front Association</a> unveiled a plaque on the South Holland Centre to explain the significance of the clock tower.

Lutyens' memorial in Ayscoughfee Hall gardens was constructed by Hodson Limited of Nottingham, at the south end of the formal gardens, replacing an earlier castellated tower—a 19th-century folly known as the "Owl Tower". The unveiling took place at a ceremony on 9 June 1922, presided over by General <a href="Ian%20Standish%20Monteith%20Hamilton">Sir Ian Hamilton</a> and dedicated by Reverend <a href="Alfred%20Jarvis">Alfred Jarvis</a>, Assistant Chaplain-General to <a href="Northern%20Command%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Northern Command</a>. Barbara McLaren attended the ceremony along with several other members of the Jekyll and McLaren families. Several dignitaries gave speeches at the ceremony, including Jarvis, who spoke of the dead among the poppies on the Western Front, a "symbol of oblivion". Hamilton spoke of the results of the carnage of the war; referring to the idea that the First World War was <a href="the%20war%20to%20end%20war">the war to end war</a>, he told the assembled: "The result has been so different. Europe is a seething cauldron of racial hatred; Ireland [...] is linked in our minds with the idea of murder; Mesopotamia [modern-day Iraq], India, and Egypt are straining at the leash of civilisation." The general concluded: "If you want to end war, you must end hatred" and that "In that way, I believe we shall be working towards peace, and in that way we will be doing in our own small way our best each of us—and Spalding minds united are a great force—and in that way we shall perpetuate the memories of those whose untimely deaths we have come here to commemorate". At the conclusion of the speeches a lone bugler played the "<a href="Last%20Post">Last Post</a>" and the crowd sang <a href="God%20Save%20the%20Queen">the national anthem</a>, after which the dignitaries—including McLaren and her sons—laid floral tributes around the Stone of Remembrance.

The names of a further 24 casualties from the First World War were added to the central panel of the memorial prior to Remembrance Sunday 2014. The additions were the result of research by a member of the local branch of <a href="the%20Royal%20British%20Legion">the Royal British Legion</a> (RBL), which produced a list of 50 names, though the remaining casualties' connections to Spalding were deemed too tenuous for their names to be included. As a result of local government reorganisations, the memorial is now the responsibility of <a href="South%20Holland%2C%20Lincolnshire">South Holland</a> District Council, which is based in Spalding.

Spalding's war memorial comprises a brick-built pavilion structure with <a href="hipped%20roof">hipped roof</a> of red <a href="pantile">pantile</a>s and floored with red bricks in a <a href="herringbone%20pattern">herringbone pattern</a>. The side of the pavilion facing the pool has three <a href="Tuscan%20order">Tuscan</a> stone arches, with another Tuscan arch opening on each sidewall. The solid rear wall bears two painted stone flags—the <a href="Union%20Flag">Union Flag</a> to the left and the <a href="White%20Ensign">White Ensign</a> to the right—and three panels on which are inscribed the names of over 200 servicemen from Spalding who died in the First World War. The central panel bears the dedication: "IN LOVE AND HONOUR OF THOSE WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR COUNTRY IN THE YEARS OF WAR MCMXIV – MCMXIX / THIS MEMORIAL IS RAISED IN THEIR HOME BY THE MEN AND WOMEN OF SPALDING". The <a href="frieze">frieze</a> inside the pavilion contains a further inscription: "ETERNAL REST GRANT TO THEM O LORD AND LET LIGHT PERPETUAL SHINE UPON THEM". A separate stone is dedicated to Francis McLaren and inscribed "THIS STONE COMMEMORATES FRANCIS WALTER STAFFORD McLAREN MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR THE SPALDING DIVISION 1910–1917 WHEN HE FELL IN THE SERVICE OF HIS COUNTRY AT THE AGE OF 31".

A Stone of Remembrance is sited on a platform of three steps in front of the pavilion, inscribed with the phrase "THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE" and the dates of the two world wars (the dates of the Second World War were added at a later date, though the names of the casualties from that conflict were not). The stone is carved from a single piece of rock, with very slight curvature (<a href="entasis">entasis</a>) barely visible to the naked eye. It is long and devoid of any decoration besides the inscription. A long pool leads away from the structures—originally a canal from the garden first recorded in 1732, which Lutyens remodelled to form a <a href="reflecting%20pool">reflecting pool</a> in the style of an Italian formal garden; three low fountains were added at a later date. The pavilion and the pool are surrounded by yew hedges, which on the east side are broken at regular intervals by iron gates which lead to a peace garden, added in 1994. The view of the pavilion at the head of the reflecting pool is reminiscent of <a href="Bodnant%20Garden">Bodnant Garden</a> at Lord Aberconway's home in Wales, Francis McLaren's childhood home.

By the time the memorial at Spalding was unveiled in 1922, Lutyens had already been engaged in work on First World War memorials in Britain and abroad for several years. He had designed <a href="The%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">the Cenotaph</a> on <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a> in London (the permanent version of which was unveiled in 1920), which became the focus for the national <a href="Remembrance%20Sunday">Remembrance Sunday</a> commemorations. His work from 1917 for the Imperial War Graves Commission (eventually as one of the Principal Architects for France and Belgium) included the <a href="Stone%20of%20Remembrance">Stone of Remembrance</a> (used in the first cemeteries from 1920) and the <a href="Thiepval%20Memorial%20to%20the%20Missing">Thiepval Memorial to the Missing</a> (unveiled in 1932)—the largest British war memorial anywhere in the world. The Cenotaph and Lutyens' connections from his pre-war work designing <a href="country%20house">country house</a>s led to commissions for dozens of war memorials across Britain and elsewhere in the Commonwealth. His initial design for Spalding was one of several of Lutyens' early post-war commissions featured in a war memorials exhibition hosted by the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a> at the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> in London in 1919. Historic England described Spalding as "an exceptional departure" from the usual style of Lutyens' war memorials. The design is not used elsewhere in his war memorials, but the pavilion had a significant influence on Lutyens' later designs for buildings in Imperial War Graves Commission cemeteries on the Western Front. The resemblance is said to be "striking" at Anneux British Cemetery, Cambrai, and the Tuscan loggia motif recurs at several other cemeteries as well.

Spalding's memorial became relatively obscure, and was not covered extensively in any publication about Lutyens' works until the publication of Tim Skelton's "Lutyens and the Great War" in 2008. Barbara McLaren later married <a href="Bernard%20Freyberg%2C%201st%20Baron%20Freyberg">Bernard Freyberg</a>, an officer in the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Division%20War%20Memorial">Royal Naval Division War Memorial</a>, which Skelton speculates may have led to Lutyens' commission for the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Division%20Memorial">Royal Naval Division Memorial</a> on <a href="Horse%20Guards%20Parade">Horse Guards Parade</a> in London.

The memorial was designated a grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> in November 1975. In November 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a "national collection" and all 44 of his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their <a href="National%20Heritage%20List%20for%20England">National Heritage List for England</a> list entries updated and expanded. As part of this process, Spalding War Memorial was upgraded to grade I. Ayscoughfee Hall itself is also listed at grade I, while the gardens are listed at grade II on the <a href="Register%20of%20Historic%20Parks%20and%20Gardens%20of%20special%20historic%20interest%20in%20England">Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England</a>.

Emerson "Bud" Dunn (May 15, 1918 – January 11, 2001) was a <a href="Tennessee%20Walking%20Horse">Tennessee Walking Horse</a> <a href="horse%20trainer">trainer</a> from Kentucky who spent most of his career in northern Alabama. He <a href="horse%20training">trained horses</a> for over forty years and won his first Tennessee Walking Horse <a href="List%20of%20World%20Grand%20Champion%20Tennessee%20Walking%20Horses">World Grand Championship</a> at age 74 with <a href="Dark%20Spirit%27s%20Rebel">Dark Spirit's Rebel</a>; at the time, he was the oldest rider to win the honor. He was inducted into the Tennessee Walking Horse Hall of Fame in 1987 and named trainer of the year in 1980 and 1991. In 1999 at age 81, Dunn surpassed his own record for the oldest winning rider by winning his second World Grand Championship, riding <a href="RPM%20%28horse%29">RPM</a>. He died of a heart attack in January 2001.

Dunn was born on May 15, 1918 in <a href="Scott%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Scott County, Kentucky</a>, near <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington</a>, the second child and only son of Lucius and Sadie Burgess Dunn. He was named Emerson but was generally known as "Bud". Horses played a large part in his early life, and he later said that he "came into the world around them". Dunn began training horses in his teens, and in 1951 he began to specialize in training Tennessee Walking Horses, a <a href="gaited%20horse">gaited breed</a> often ridden in <a href="saddle%20seat">saddle seat</a> competition, noted for its unique "<a href="ambling%20gait%23running%20walk">running walk</a>".

Dunn's training facility, Bud Dunn Stables, (later Bud Dunn and Son Stables) was in <a href="Florence%2C%20Alabama">Florence, Alabama</a>, on a ten-acre property. Dunn moved to north Alabama from Georgia in the 1950s, and bought out another trainer who was quitting the horse business. By the mid-1980s, Dunn had over 50 horses in training at a time, and had several full-time employees. He also judged Tennessee Walking Horse shows, including the Spring Celebration, an annual Tennessee Walking Horse show in <a href="Shelbyville%2C%20Tennessee">Shelbyville, Tennessee</a> that is traditionally popular with trainers who hope to enter horses in the National Celebration later in the year.

Dunn trained and showed Tennessee Walking Horses for 50 years, and during his career won two World Grand Championships and 20 World Championships with various horses, competing in 125 to 150 <a href="horse%20show">horse show</a>s a year. Dunn participated in the breed's major annual horse show, the <a href="Tennessee%20Walking%20Horse%20National%20Celebration">Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration</a>, nearly every year from 1950. By 1993 he was so popular that he often signed autographs for several hours before a performance. In total, Dunn personally showed 108 horses at the Celebration, and several hundred others which he trained were shown by other riders. Among them was Sundust Royal Flush, a stallion who, at the 1970 Celebration, won both the Preliminary Stallion class and the Three-Year-Old World Championship. Among other winning horses were Stock Exchange, who won the Junior Stallion Championship at the Dixie Jubilee in <a href="Baton%20Rouge%2C%20Louisiana">Baton Rouge, Louisiana</a> in 1984, and Yankee Delight, who won the Grand Championship at the same show. Dunn rode both horses to their wins. Among horses that were trained by Dunn but ridden by amateur riders, Delight Puff and Stuff was Amateur Champion, and Aces Executive was Ladies' Champion, also in 1984.

Despite Dunn's success, he did not ride a winning horse to the World Grand Championship until 1992; fellow trainers felt that he was blackballed because he did not live in the Shelbyville area, where the Celebration is held. With his eventual success, he twice became the oldest rider ever to win the World Grand Championship, the first time at age 74. 

Dunn was given the Trainer of the Year award by the Professional Walking Horse Trainers Organization for the first time in 1980. In 1987, he was inducted into the Tennessee Walking Horse Hall of Fame. In 1991 Dunn was named the Tennessee Walking Horse Professional Trainer of the Year by his fellow trainers for consistently showing and training top-quality horses. After his death, Dunn was inducted into the <a href="Lauderdale%20County%2C%20Alabama">Lauderdale County</a> Sports Hall of Fame in 2003.

Dunn had three children: Billie Ann by his first wife; David and Steven by his second wife Charlotte Blythe Dunn, and no children with his third wife Elaine (née Lewis). Steve Dunn also became a successful horse trainer, winning two <a href="Tennessee%20Walking%20Horse%20National%20Celebration%23World%20Grand%20Championship">World Grand Championships</a>, the first before his father won one. Steve Dunn's winning horses were Motown Magic in 1989, and <a href="Out%20On%20Parole%20%28horse%29">Out On Parole</a> in 2002. Bud and Steve Dunn were at the time of Bud Dunn's death the only father and son to win World Grand Championships within the Tennessee Walking Horse industry. When Bud won his first World Grand Championship in 1992, three years after his son's first, Steve said, "I think him winning meant more to me than when I won it." Bud Dunn said of his partnership with Steve, "I always wanted him to work out here. But ain't many fathers and sons ever got along that long."

Bud Dunn died on January 11, 2001 at the age of 82, following two <a href="heart%20attack">heart attack</a>s brought about by complications from <a href="knee%20replacement">knee replacement</a> surgery. He was buried in Oakwood Cemetery, in <a href="Sheffield%2C%20Alabama">Sheffield, Alabama</a>, United States.

Dunn trained and rode his first World Grand Championship on the <a href="bay%20%28horse%29">bay</a> <a href="stallion">stallion</a> <a href="Dark%20Spirit%27s%20Rebel">Dark Spirit's Rebel</a>. In 1991, the horse placed third in the competition. In 1992, the horse and rider pair won at most of the shows they had entered, including the World Grand Championship at that year's Celebration. Dunn had been training for 42 years at the time, and was 74 years old, making him the oldest trainer ever to win the class. The competition was held in front of a record crowd of 28,000. "Rebel" was the favorite horse going into the competition, out of a field of 13, and the team of Dunn and the stallion was described by the Florence "<a href="TimesDaily">TimesDaily</a>" as the "most popular team in Celebration history". Dunn said after the win, "I've been coming to the Celebration since 1950 and I've never seen anything like it. That made it twice as good. It's nice to know that I've got that many friends and supporters." The following year, Dark Spirit's Rebel was retired from competition in a formal ceremony at the Celebration. Dunn's riding number, 1865, was also retired.

Dunn's second World Grand Champion was <a href="RPM%20%28horse%29">RPM</a>, a son of Dark Spirit's Rebel. Dunn showed RPM to a Three-Year-Old World Championship in 1997. In 1998, RPM and Dunn won the Four-Year-Old World Championship and then placed second in the World Grand Championship; the latter achievement made them the Reserve World Grand Champions. Dunn had hopes of winning first the next year. In May 1999 the horse was sold to L R & N Partners, LLC for $1.25 million. The new owners moved RPM to trainer Sammy Day's stable in Shelbyville, with the intention of entering him in the Celebration. Shortly before the Celebration, Day was convicted of bribing a judge, fined, and put on a five-year suspension. Dunn was given the task of riding RPM in the show, and won the World Grand Championship. Dunn was 81, again making him the oldest rider ever to win the class, breaking his earlier record. At the same show, Steve Dunn rode Out On Parole to a Two-Year-Old World Championship, and another Dunn-trained horse, Broken Promises, won the Four-Year-Old World Championship.

Portrait of Maria Portinari

Portrait of Maria Portinari is a small c. 1470–72 painting by <a href="Hans%20Memling">Hans Memling</a> in <a href="tempera">tempera</a> and <a href="oil%20painting">oil</a> on <a href="panel%20painting">oak panel</a>. It portrays Maria Maddalena Baroncelli, about whom very little is known. She is about 14 years old, and depicted shortly before her wedding to the Italian banker <a href="Tommaso%20Portinari">Tommaso Portinari</a>. Maria is dressed in the height of late <a href="1400%E2%80%931500%20in%20European%20fashion">fifteenth-century fashion</a>, with a long black <a href="hennin">hennin</a> with a transparent veil and an elaborate jewel-studded necklace. Her headdress is similar and necklace identical to those in her depiction in <a href="Hugo%20van%20der%20Goes">Hugo van der Goes</a>'s later "<a href="Portinari%20Altarpiece">Portinari Altarpiece</a>" (c. 1475), a painting that may have been partly based on Memling's portrait.

The panel is the right <a href="Donor%20portrait">wing</a> of a devotional and hinged <a href="triptych">triptych</a>; the lost center panel is recorded in sixteenth-century inventories as a "<a href="Madonna%20%28art%29">Virgin and Child</a>", and the left panel depicts Tommaso. The panels were commissioned by Tommaso, a member of a prominent <a href="Florence">Florentine</a> family. Tommaso was a confidant of <a href="Charles%20the%20Bold">Charles the Bold</a> and an ambitious manager of the <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a> branch of a bank controlled by <a href="Lorenzo%20de%27%20Medici">Lorenzo de' Medici</a>, and a well known and active patron of <a href="Flemish%20art">Flemish art</a>. Tommaso eventually lost his position due to a series of large and risky unsecured loans given to Charles.

Maria and Tommaso's portraits hang alongside each other at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> in New York. The central panel is lost; some art historians suggest it may have been his "Virgin and Child" in the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a>, London.

The portrait was commissioned by the art-loving Tommaso as the right-hand wing of a <a href="triptych">triptych</a>. She was placed opposite her husband, with a now lost central Madonna and Child. Their small size and intimacy suggests that the portraits were commissioned for private prayer; some art historians believe, given that Tommaso's cultural acumen and preoccupation with his social standing, they were partially accessible to the public. The triptych may have been intended for the <a href="Portinari%20Chapel">Portinari Chapel</a>, located behind the <a href="apse">apse</a> of the <a href="Basilica%20of%20Sant%27Eustorgio">Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio</a>, Milan, and constructed between 1462 and 1468.

Maria would have been around 14 years old at the time the portrait was commissioned, either the year of her marriage in 1470 or shortly after. Tommaso represented the <a href="Medici%20bank">Medici bank</a> in Bruges, but after a promising early career he gave a number of risky and unsecured loans to <a href="Charles%20the%20Bold">Charles the Bold</a> which were left unpaid and eventually led to the branch's insolvency. He died young, and when the portrait was first mentioned as part of his collection in 1501, he was no longer alive. Maria is recorded as being alive at the time; she was executor to her husband's will but her fate thereafter is uncertain. The 1501 inventory places both portraits as wings, with a central "Virgin and Child" panel; "a small, valuable panel painting, with an image of Our Lady in the middle and on the sides painted Tommaso and mona Maria his wife" ("una tavoletta dipinta preg[i]ata cum nel mezo una immagine di Nostra Donna e delle bande si è Tommaso e mona Maria sua donna dipinti in deta tavoletta").

The half-length portrait shows Maria Portinari (born Maria Maddalena Baroncelli in 1456) in a three-quarter view turned to the left. She has somewhat Nordic features, and is dressed in the high fashion then found at the apex of Flemish and Italian high society. She is placed against a flat, opaque, dark background, with her hands clasped in prayer. In Memling's early portraits the backgrounds tend to be plain, as was invariably the case in the work of <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a> and <a href="Roger%20van%20der%20Weyden">Roger van der Weyden</a>, and favored within Burgundian court circles. In contrast, Memling's later portraits are set within rich interiors or against landscapes framed by columns, such as in his "", a fact that has assisted in dating his work.

Maria's face is idealised and conforms to contemporary ideals of beauty, especially in the raised eyebrows and elongated nose. The art historian <a href="Lorne%20Campbell%20%28art%20historian%29">Lorne Campbell</a> has noted her facial similarity to the Virgin in Memling's panel at the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Ancient%20Art">National Museum of Ancient Art</a>, Lisbon. In this work, Maria's frame is slightly undersized compared to her head, a common characteristic of contemporary northern portraiture, also found in similar works by <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a> and <a href="Petrus%20Christus">Petrus Christus</a>. Her elbows rest on an unseen <a href="parapet">parapet</a> that coincides with the lower edge of the painted stone frame, acting as a <a href="trompe-l%27%C5%93il">trompe-l'œil</a> which situates her both in the same reality and in closer proximity to the viewer. Maria wears a relatively modest wedding band lined with <a href="ruby">rubies</a> and <a href="sapphire">sapphire</a>. Her necklace is colored with mostly red and blue jewels, similar to <a href="Hugo%20van%20der%20Goes">Hugo van der Goes</a>'s portrait of her in the "<a href="Portinari%20Altarpiece">Portinari Altarpiece</a>".

The black <a href="hennin">hennin</a> is long, truncated and relatively plain with a transparent veil which falls around the back of her neck, resting briefly on her shoulder. Probably it was kept relatively unadorned so as not to distract from the necklace. Her costume is mostly black or brown, with a wide but high neckline and white fur lined hems on the sleeves. Portinari has dark eyes, a strong nose, full lips and a pointed chin. Her visible hand, folded in prayer but unrealistically off center, wears what looks like a jeweled ring. The dark sleeves of her dress contain red or rouge velvet-like cloth tightened by a white belt. Her hair is shaved back to achieve the high forehead and sculptural look fashionable at the time.
Maria's necklace is gilded and studded with <a href="pearl">pearl</a>s, rubies and sapphires. It contains three open flowers; one white with a ruby jewel, another red with a sapphire, and one gray-blue with a pearl. The upper line contains a row of <a href="onyx">onyx</a> beads, from which hang, according to the art historian Sophie McConnell "small teardrops" gold and bluish-grey enameled wire. The necklace is very similar to that worn by <a href="Margaret%20of%20York">Margaret of York</a> at her wedding to <a href="Charles%20the%20Bold">Charles the Bold</a> in 1468, an occasion the Portinaris attended. A depiction of Charles in a double Portrait with <a href="Isabella%20of%20Bourbon">Isabella of Bourbon</a>, now in Ghent, closely resembles that of Thomas in facial features, while Isabella and Maria look very similar. Dirk de Vos believes van der Goes may have seen Memling's panel when he stayed with Tommaso in Bruges c. 1497, and incorporated elements for his own depiction.

The panel is in very good condition and among the best preserved of Memling's work. Technical examination using <a href="Radiography">x-radiography</a> shows that the hennin originally contained pearls which formed the letters "T" and "M", standing for Tommaso and Maria. Similar pearl monograms, which would have been intended as a sign of marital connection, can be found in van der Goes's portraits of the couple. <a href="Maryan%20Ainsworth">Maryan Ainsworth</a> concludes that they were removed from the final composition as they may have been "deemed too conspicuous a show of opulence in the presence of the Virgin and Child, most likely the now lost object of Maria's veneration." Maria's ear was at one stage exposed, but was later covered by the wide frontlet of the hennin, a change of mind also found in the very similar portrait of the female donor in Memling's c. 1470s to early 1480 <a href="Donne%20Triptych">Donne Triptych</a>.

The panel has at various times been attributed to van der Goes and van Eyck, but was recognized as by Memling as early as the time of the seminal 1902 exhibition "<a href="Exposition%20des%20primitifs%20flamands%20%C3%A0%20Bruges">Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges</a>" in Bruges, when it was lent by <a href="Goldschmidt%20family">Léopold Goldschmidt</a> of Paris. In 1916 <a href="Max%20J.%20Friedl%C3%A4nder">Max J. Friedländer</a> described it as "without doubt" by Memling, and c. 1475. The art historian Catheline Périer-d'Ieteren, while noting that Memling's portrait faces were rarely underdrawn, wrote that this panel contains "thin yet confident incised lines" which may be preliminary drawings for Maria's face, perhaps made from life.
The triptych was recorded in an inventory of Tommaso's holdings upon his death. The New York panels passed through Tommaso's son Francesco. The central panel was described in his 1544 will as "a small tabernacle with three movable wings, in which is depicted the glorious Virgin Mary and the father and mother of the donor" ("unum tabernaculettum que clauditur con tribus sportellis, in qua est depicta imago Gloriossime virginis Marie et patris et matris dicti testatoris"). Francesco bequeathed the triptych to the convent of the <a href="hospital%20of%20Santa%20Maria%20Nuova">hospital of Santa Maria Nuova</a> in Florence. Records indicate a small intact winged altarpiece which stayed in the hospital's possession until around the time of the Napoleonic occupation, when it was probably broken up.

Maria's panel was sold as a <a href="Dieric%20Bouts">Dieric Bouts</a> for 6,000 francs in 1870. It later passed through several private collections before arriving in the possession of of Rome, who briefly returned it to Florence. Thereafter the panels were in London from 1901, from where they were sold to Villeroy Goldschmidt of Paris by for $426,500 in 1910. They were purchased, also in 1910, by the collector <a href="Benjamin%20Altman">Benjamin Altman</a> of New York on the advice of Max Friedländer, along with works by <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a>, <a href="Gerard%20David">Gerard David</a> and <a href="Hans%20Holbein%20the%20Younger">Hans Holbein the Younger</a> – paintings whose "grave austerity seems to have been most in tune with his own taste". Altman bequeathed his holdings to the Metropolitan on his death in 1913.

Northampton War Memorial

Northampton War Memorial, officially the Town and County War Memorial, is a <a href="First%20World%20War%20memorial">First World War memorial</a> on Wood Hill in the centre of <a href="Northampton">Northampton</a>, the <a href="county%20town">county town</a> of <a href="Northamptonshire">Northamptonshire</a>, in central <a href="England">England</a>. Designed by architect <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>, it is a <a href="Stone%20of%20Remembrance">Stone of Remembrance</a> flanked by twin <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a>s draped with painted stone flags standing in a small garden in what was once part of the churchyard of <a href="All%20Saints%27%20Church%2C%20Northampton">All Saints' Church</a>. 

Discussion of a war memorial for Northampton began shortly after the armistice in 1918, and from July 1919 a temporary wooden cenotaph stood on Abington Street in the town centre. The Northamptonshire War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a permanent memorial. The monument's design was completed and approved quickly, but its installation was delayed by six years until the site could be purchased from the Church of England, which required a <a href="faculty%20%28instrument%29">faculty</a> from the local diocese. The memorial was finally unveiled on 11 November 1926 after a service and a parade including local schoolchildren and civic leaders. 

Northampton's memorial is one of the more elaborate town memorials in England. It uses three features characteristic of Lutyens' war memorials: a pair of obelisks, the Stone of Remembrance (which Lutyens designed for the <a href="Imperial%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Imperial War Graves Commission</a>), and painted stone flags on the obelisks, which were rejected for his <a href="the%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">Cenotaph</a> in London but feature on several of his other memorials. Today it is a Grade I <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>; it was upgraded from Grade II in 2015 when Lutyens' war memorials were declared a "national collection" and all were granted listed building status or had their listing renewed.

The <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> produced casualties on an unprecedented scale; men from every town and village in Northamptonshire died in the war, with the exception of two <a href="thankful%20villages">thankful villages</a> (<a href="East%20Carlton">East Carlton</a> in the north of the county and <a href="Woodend%2C%20Northamptonshire">Woodend</a> in the south). In the war's aftermath, thousands of memorials were built across Britain. 

Among the most prominent designers of war memorials was architect <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>, described by <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> as "the leading English architect of his generation". Prior to the First World War, Lutyens established his reputation designing country houses for wealthy patrons; in the war's aftermath, he devoted much of his time to memorialising the casualties. He served as one of the three principal architects to the <a href="Imperial%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Imperial War Graves Commission</a> (IWGC; later the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, CWGC) and designed numerous war memorials for towns and villages across Britain, as well as several elsewhere in the Commonwealth. He was responsible for <a href="The%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">the Cenotaph</a> on <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a> in London, which became the focal point of the national <a href="Remembrance%20Sunday">Remembrance Sunday</a> commemorations; the <a href="Thiepval%20Memorial%20to%20the%20Missing">Thiepval Memorial to the Missing</a>, the largest British war memorial anywhere in the world; and the <a href="Stone%20of%20Remembrance">Stone of Remembrance</a> (also known as the Great War Stone), which appears in all large <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Commonwealth War Graves Commission</a> cemeteries and forms part of several of his civic memorials, including Northampton's.

Northampton's first war memorial was a temporary <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a> built from wood and plaster which stood in Abington Street from July 1919 as a placeholder until a more permanent memorial could be erected; the temporary cenotaph was the focal point for remembrance services until the installation of the permanent memorial. As in several towns and cities, there were discussions within the town as to whether its war memorial should serve a purely monumental purpose or some sort of community function. Suggestions included renovating civic buildings, a new 2,000-seat concert hall, and a classical-style arch on Guildhall road. The Northamptonshire War Memorial Committee, chaired by local landowner <a href="John%20Powys%2C%205th%20Baron%20Lilford">John Powys, 5th Baron Lilford</a>, eventually commissioned Lutyens to design a purely commemorative monument, and selected a site in part of the churchyard of <a href="All%20Saints%27%20Church%2C%20Northampton">All Saints' Church</a>. The memorial was funded by public donations, including a donation of £50 from Lord Lilford.

Lutyens' designs were complete by 1920 and approved in November of that year, but as the chosen site was part of the churchyard, and several graves would have to be relocated to accommodate the memorial, the war memorial committee had to seek a <a href="Faculty%20%28instrument%29">faculty</a> from the <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Peterborough">Diocese of Peterborough</a> (the diocese in whose jurisdiction Northampton falls), which delayed the installation. The Reverend Geoffrey Warden, vicar of All Saints' Church, submitted the application in 1922, supported by two church wardens and two parishioners. Construction work commenced only in 1926, six years after the completion of the designs. By July 1926, the "Northampton Independent" reported that the obelisks had been carved and were waiting for the flags to be painted before they could be erected.

Northampton's is a comparatively elaborate war memorial, especially for a town rather than a city. It consists of a <a href="Stone%20of%20Remembrance">Stone of Remembrance</a> flanked by tall twin <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a>s, each adorned with a pair of painted stone flags. Its use of obelisks, a <a href="Stone%20of%20Remembrance">Stone of Remembrance</a>, and painted flags—all features characteristic of Lutyens' war memorials—make it particularly significant among his works.

Each obelisk sits on a tall, four-tiered rectangular column which itself stands on a wider, undercut square plinth. The obelisks and their supporting columns are ornately decorated. A narrow cross is set into the obelisks while the town's coat of arms is moulded onto the columns; the columns contain deep decorative <a href="Niche%20%28architecture%29">niches</a>, forming an arch shape beneath the obelisks. Obelisks feature in several of Lutyens' war memorials, though only Northampton's and <a href="Manchester%20Cenotaph">Manchester's</a> use a pair of flanking obelisks (in Manchester's case, the obelisks flank a cenotaph, rather than a stone); both are particularly fine designs in which Lutyens uses the obelisks with "dignity and simple dramatic effect", according to historian Richard Barnes. The obelisks are inscribed with the dates of the First and Second World Wars in Roman numerals (the inscriptions relating to the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> were added at a later date).
Two stone flags—painted in the form of the <a href="Union%20Flag">Union Flag</a> and the flags of the Royal Navy (the <a href="White%20Ensign">White Ensign</a>), Merchant Navy (the <a href="Red%20Ensign">Red Ensign</a>), and Royal Air Force (the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force%20Ensign">RAF Ensign</a>)—appear to hang from each obelisk, draping around the <a href="cornice">cornice</a>s; each flag is surmounted by gold wreaths. Lutyens first proposed stone flags for use on the Cenotaph on Whitehall, but the proposal was rejected in favour of fabric flags (though they were used on several other memorials, including <a href="Rochdale%20Cenotaph">Rochdale Cenotaph</a> and the <a href="Arch%20of%20Remembrance">Arch of Remembrance</a> in <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a>). The stone is a <a href="monolith">monolith</a> (carved from a single piece of rock), curved so slightly as to barely be visible to the naked eye, long and devoid of any decoration beyond the inscriptions. Unusually, the Stone of Remembrance is inscribed on both faces. The east face bears the inscription Lutyens chose for all his Stones of Remembrance: "THEIR NAME LIVETH / FOR EVERMORE", as suggested by <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>, truncated from a verse in the <a href="Book%20of%20Ecclesiastes">Book of Ecclesiastes</a>; the west face is inscribed "THE SOULS OF THE RIGHTEOUS / ARE IN THE HANDS OF GOD", from <a href="The%20Wisdom%20of%20Solomon">The Wisdom of Solomon</a>.

The whole memorial is raised on a stone platform that forms a narrow path between the stone and the obelisks. The Stone of Remembrance is further raised on three stone steps. The memorial stands in a small garden now just outside the All Saints churchyard, defined by a low stone wall to the front and a yew hedge to the rear with ornamental gateways to either side. The gates are of cast iron and supported by large stone piers with urn <a href="finial">finial</a>s. The wall is inscribed: "TO THE MEMORY OF ALL THOSE OF THIS TOWN AND COUNTY WHO SERVED AND DIED IN THE GREAT WAR".

The memorial was eventually unveiled on 11 November (<a href="Armistice%20Day">Armistice Day</a>) 1926, as part of a large <a href="wikt%3Aecumenical">ecumenical</a> service, which included 5,000 local schoolchildren. The crowd was large enough that the service could not be accommodated in the church and was instead held in the market square. At the conclusion of the service, the crowd proceeded to the new memorial; the parade was led by veterans from the Battle of Mons and included other military representatives, nurses from <a href="Northampton%20General%20Hospital">Northampton General Hospital</a>, and the town's civic leaders. Once in the square, the unveiling was performed by General <a href="Henry%20Horne%2C%201st%20Baron%20Horne">Henry Horne, 1st Baron Horne</a> and the memorial was dedicated by the Reverend <a href="Norman%20Lang%20%28bishop%29">Norman Lang</a>, <a href="Suffragan%20Bishop%20of%20Leicester">Suffragan Bishop of Leicester</a>. Horne committed the memorial to the care of the town's mayor and <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Council">Northamptonshire County Council</a>, and in his speech referred to Northampton's role as the <a href="county%20town">county town</a>; he observed that communities across Northamptonshire would be erecting their own memorials, but felt that it was "right and fitting that there should stand in the county town some visible monument, some tangible memorial appealing to the heart through the eye, of the bravery, devotion to duty, and self-sacrifice of the men of Northamptonshire". The <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a> laid a wreath during a ceremony on 7 July 1927, the year after the unveiling. 

The Town and County War Memorial does not contain a list of casualties. The local branch of <a href="the%20Royal%20British%20Legion">the Royal British Legion</a> launched a campaign for a memorial dedicated to the town and containing a list of names. A garden of remembrance was built in Abington Square, the location of the original temporary cenotaph, and unveiled by Major General Sir John Brown in 1937; the names of the fallen were inscribed on the garden walls. The memorial to <a href="Edgar%20Mobbs">Edgar Mobbs</a>—a professional rugby player from Northampton who was killed in the First World War in 1917—was moved into the garden.

The memorial was designated a Grade II* <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> on 22 January 1976. In November 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a "national collection". All 44 of his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their <a href="National%20Heritage%20List%20for%20England">National Heritage List for England</a> list entries updated and expanded. As part of this process, Northampton War Memorial was upgraded to Grade I.
