Cortinarius violaceus

Cortinarius violaceus, <a href="common%20name">commonly known</a> as the violet webcap or violet cort, is a <a href="fungus">fungus</a> in the webcap genus "<a href="Cortinarius">Cortinarius</a>" native across the Northern Hemisphere. The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> are dark purple <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>s with <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a> up to across, sporting <a href="lamellae%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> underneath. The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stalk</a> measures by , sometimes with a thicker base. The dark <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> has a smell reminiscent of <a href="cedar%20wood">cedar wood</a>. Forming <a href="Symbiosis">symbiotic</a> (<a href="Ectomycorrhiza">mycorrhizal</a>) relationships with the roots of various plant species, "C. violaceus" is found predominantly in <a href="conifer%20forest">conifer forest</a>s in North America and <a href="deciduous%20forest">deciduous forest</a>s in Europe.

Though they are <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>, the appearance of these mushrooms is more distinctive than their taste. The species was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in 1753, and has undergone several name changes. It is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus "Cortinarius", but is readily distinguished from other species in the genus by its dark colouration and distinct <a href="Cystidium">cystidia</a>. There are some populations that seem to prefer <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> trees and others that prefer <a href="pine">pine</a>s, but no <a href="genetic%20divergence">genetic divergence</a> between the two has been found. When identified as <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomically</a> separate from the deciduous-preferring populations, the pine-preferring populations have been referred to either as a separate species, "C. hercynicus", or as a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, "C. violaceus" ssp. "hercynicus". Other populations once identified as "C. violaceus" or close to that species have now been described as new and separate species, such as "<a href="Cortinarius%20palatinus">C. palatinus</a>", "<a href="Cortinarius%20neotropicus">C. neotropicus</a>", "<a href="Cortinarius%20altissimus">C. altissimus</a>", "<a href="Cortinarius%20kioloensis">C. kioloensis</a>" and "<a href="Cortinarius%20hallowellensis">C. hallowellensis</a>".

"Agaricus violaceus" was one of the few fungal species named by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in his 1753 work "<a href="Species%20Plantarum">Species Plantarum</a>". The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "violaceus" refers to the deep violet colour of its cap. In English, it is <a href="common%20name">commonly known</a> as the violet webcap, or violet cort. French naturalist <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lamarck">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</a> viewed it as a <a href="variety%20%28taxonomy%29">variety</a> ("violaceus") of a variable species he described as "Amanita araneosa" in 1783, and <a href="Christiaan%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christiaan Hendrik Persoon</a> placed it in the <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">Section</a> "Cortinaria" of "Agaricus" in his 1801 work "Synopsis Methodica Fungorum". "Cortinarius" was established as a genus by English botanist <a href="Samuel%20Frederick%20Gray">Samuel Frederick Gray</a> in the first volume of his 1821 work "A Natural Arrangement of British Plants", where the species was recorded as "Cortinaria violacea", "the violet curtain-stool".

The starting date of fungal <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> had been set as 1 January 1821, to coincide with the date of the works of the "father of mycology", the Swedish naturalist <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a>, which meant the name "Cortinarius violaceus" required <a href="sanctioned%20name">sanction</a> by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid. Thus the species was written as "Cortinarius violaceus" (L.: Fr.) Gray. However, a 1987 revision of the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Botanical%20Nomenclature">International Code of Botanical Nomenclature</a> set the starting date at 1 May 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus's "Species Plantarum". Hence, the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries's authority, and is thus written as "Cortinarius violaceus" (L.) Gray.

German botanist <a href="Friedrich%20Otto%20W%C3%BCnsche">Friedrich Otto Wünsche</a> described the species as "Inoloma violaceum" in 1877. In 1891, his countryman <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> published "<a href="Revisio%20Generum%20Plantarum">Revisio Generum Plantarum</a>", his response to what he perceived as poor method in existing nomenclatural practice. He called the violet webcap "Gomphos violaceus" in 1898. However, Kuntze's revisionary programme was not accepted by the majority of biologists.

"Cortinarius violaceus" was designated as the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> for the genus "Cortinarius" by <a href="Frederic%20Clements">Frederic Clements</a> and <a href="Cornelius%20Lott%20Shear">Cornelius Lott Shear</a> in their 1931 work "The Genera of Fungi". <a href="Mycologist">Mycologist</a> <a href="David%20Arora">David Arora</a> considers this odd, due to the mushroom's unusual colour and <a href="Cystidium">cystidia</a>. Because of this designation, if "C. violaceus" were to be split from the rest of the current genus, then, according to the rules of the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Botanical%20Nomenclature">International Code of Botanical Nomenclature</a>, it would retain the name "Cortinarius", while the other species would have to be reclassified. The species was one of only two placed in the "Cortinarius" subgenus "Cortinarius" by the Austrian mycologist <a href="Meinhard%20Michael%20Moser">Meinhard Moser</a>. <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">Molecular</a> investigation of webcaps worldwide has increased this number to at least twelve.

A 2015 genetic study by evolutionary biologist Emma Harrower and colleagues of "C. violaceus" and its closest relatives suggests that the group (section "Cortinarius") originated in Australasia and began <a href="Genetic%20divergence">diverging</a> from a common ancestor around 12 million years ago in the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>, with "C. violaceus" itself diverging from its closest relative around 3.9 million years ago. The fact that these species diverged relatively recently indicates that some form of dispersal must have taken place across large bodies of water. The original plant hosts were flowering plants (<a href="angiosperm">angiosperm</a>s), and "C. violaceus"—or its direct ancestor—developed a <a href="Symbiosis">symbiotic</a> relationship with pines, as well as multiple flowering plants; this may have facilitated its expansion across the Northern Hemisphere.

Some mycologists classify "C. violaceus" as two distinct species—"Cortinarius violaceus" and "Cortinarius hercynicus", with "hercynicus" relating to the <a href="Hercynian%20Forest">Hercynian Forest</a> region of southern Germany. These species are differentiated <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphologically</a> by the latter population's rounder <a href="basidiospore">spores</a>. Persoon had described "C. hercynicus" as a separate species in 1794, though Fries regarded it as conspecific with "C. violaceus". Moser separated them once again as species in 1967, and Norwegian biologist Tor Erik Brandrud classified "C. hercynicus" as a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of "C. violaceus" in 1983. However, Harrower and colleagues, on limited molecular testing, found no genetic or ecological difference between the two <a href="taxon">taxa</a>.

Some fungal populations around the world that have been classified as "C. violaceus" have been found to belong to separate <a href="Lineage%20%28evolution%29">lineages</a> and hence reclassified as new species within section "Cortinarius". Two separate lineages discovered in populations from Costa Rica have been renamed "<a href="Cortinarius%20palatinus">Cortinarius palatinus</a>" and "<a href="Cortinarius%20neotropicus">C. neotropicus</a>", one from Guyana—described as <a href="sp.%20aff.">sp. aff.</a> "violaceus"—has become "<a href="Cortinarius%20altissimus">C. altissimus</a>", and another from Western Australia and <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> described as both "C. violaceus" and sp. aff. "violaceus" has become "<a href="Cortinarius%20hallowellensis">C. hallowellensis</a>". Yet another from Eastern Australia has been named "<a href="Cortinarius%20kioloensis">C. kioloensis</a>". The poorly known species "<a href="Cortinarius%20subcalyptrosporus">Cortinarius subcalyptrosporus</a>" and "<a href="Cortinarius%20atroviolaceus">Cortinarius atroviolaceus</a>" from <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a> are almost indistinguishable from "C. violaceus" outside of hard-to-observe spore detail—the former has smaller spores with a detached perisporium (outer layer) and the latter has smaller spores and fruiting bodies. Another population, known from <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>, <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> and New Zealand, was ascribed to "C. violaceus" by Moser. It was noted as very similar to the original species concept of "C. violaceus", and awaits description as a new species after a phylogenetic study revealed it to represent a distinct taxon.

"Cortinarius violaceus" has a convex (becoming broadly convex, <a href="Umbo%20%28mycology%29">umbonate</a> or flat) <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> of 3.5–15 cm (–6 in) across with an incurved margin. In colour, it is a dark violet to blue-black, and is covered in fine, downy scales. This layer on the cap is known as the <a href="pileipellis">pileipellis</a>, which is either classified as a trichoderm—parallel <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e running perpendicular to the surface and forming a layer 6–22 <a href="%C2%B5m">µm</a> wide—or rarely an ixocutis, a layer of gelatinized hyphae 2–11 µm wide. The cap surface, unlike that of many other "Cortinarius" species, is neither sticky nor slimy, though it is occasionally greasy. The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>, or stalk, is tall, and thick. Due to its swollen, bulbous nature, the base of the stipe can sometimes be as wide as . The stipe is a similar colour to the cap, and covered in <a href="wool">wool</a>-like <a href="fibril">fibril</a>s; purple <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a> can be present at the base. Younger specimens feature a <a href="Partial%20veil">veil</a>, but this vanishes quickly. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is violet, but darker below the pileipellis and in the stipe. The flesh has a mild taste, indistinctly reminiscent of <a href="cedar%20wood">cedar wood</a>, with a slight, pleasant smell, also reminiscent of cedar wood. The <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> are dark violet, changing to a purplish-brown with age. They have an <a href="Lamella%20%28mycology%29%23Classification">adnate</a> connection to the stipe, and can be very dark in older specimens. The mushroom stains red when in contact with <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a> (KOH). Fruit bodies identified as "C. v. hercynicus" are less robust than those of the nominate subspecies.

The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is rust-coloured, while the spores themselves measure 12 to 15 µm by 7 to 8.5 µm. They are rough, from elliptical to almond-shaped, and covered in medium-sized warts. The spores are wider in "C. v. hercynicus". The species is the only one in the genus to have <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> on both the faces and the edges of the gills. A large number of cystidia are present, and, individually, they measure between 60 and 100 µm by between 12 and 25 µm. They are flask-shaped, with somewhat purple contents.

Although there are many "Cortinarius" species with some degree of violet colour, "C. violaceus" and its close relatives are easily distinguished by their much darker purple colour. "<a href="Cortinarius%20iodes">Cortinarius iodes</a>" of the southeastern United States has a slimy purple cap and paler violet stipe. The other species in the section "Cortinarius" are dark purple and superficially similar, but can be differentiated based on host and geography as they do not occur in the same locations as "C. violaceus". Certain "<a href="Leptonia">Leptonia</a>" species in northwestern North America, including "<a href="Leptonia%20carnea">L. carnea</a>" and "<a href="Leptonia%20nigroviolacea">L. nigroviolacea</a>", have a similar color, but are easily differentiated due to their pink spore print.

"Cortinarius violaceus" is found across North America, Europe and Asia. Although widespread, it is not common anywhere in Europe, and it is listed as endangered in the British Isles. "Cortinarius violaceus" is a rare component of <a href="Subarctic%20climate">subarctic</a> areas of western Greenland. It has not been recorded from Iceland.

In Europe, it grows in <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> woodland during autumn, especially among <a href="oak">oak</a>, <a href="birch">birch</a> and <a href="beech">beech</a>, but is also found on occasion with <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s. It is also occasionally known from treeless <a href="heathland">heathland</a>, where it is associated with <a href="bracken">bracken</a>. The species favours <a href="soil%20acidity">acidic soil</a>. "Cortinarius violaceus" forms <a href="Ectomycorrhiza">mycorrhizal</a> associations with several species of tree. In this symbiotic relationship, the fungus gains carbon from the plant and supplies it with beneficial minerals. In Nordic countries, its hosts include white birch ("<a href="Betula%20pubescens">Betula pubescens</a>"), silver birch ("<a href="Betula%20pendula">B. pendula</a>"), European aspen ("<a href="Populus%20tremula">Populus tremula</a>") and rarely European beech ("<a href="Fagus%20sylvatica">Fagus sylvatica</a>"). No records of association with oak ("<a href="Quercus">Quercus</a>") are known from this region. Brandrud reported that what he described as spp. "hercynicus" grew with "<a href="Picea%20abies">Picea abies</a>", generally in more alkaline soils and along with mosses of the genera "<a href="Hylocomium">Hylocomium</a>" and "<a href="Pleurozium">Pleurozium</a>", and, in moister areas, big shaggy-moss ("<a href="Rhytidiadelphus%20triquetrus">Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus</a>"), as well as the <a href="Ranunculaceae">buttercup-family</a> shrub "<a href="Hepatica%20nobilis">Hepatica nobilis</a>". The species grows with "Betula pubescens" in Greenland, and is also associated with hazelnut ("<a href="Corylus%20avellana">Corylus avellana</a>") in Central and Southern Europe.

In North America, "C. violaceus" favours conifers, and, though rare over much of the continent, is relatively common in certain areas, including <a href="Mount%20Rainier%20National%20Park">Mount Rainier National Park</a> and <a href="Olympic%20National%20Park">Olympic National Park</a>. It is more common in old growth forest in the Pacific Northwest, though has sprung up in regrowth areas populated with fir, pine, aspen and alder in the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> region. Fruit bodies occur singly or in small groups, often near rotting wood, and can grow in <a href="fairy%20ring">fairy ring</a>s. Closely related species that look like "C. violaceus" can be found in Central and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Malaysia.

"Cortinarius violaceus" mushrooms are considered edible, but they are not choice; instead, the primary appeal of the species to <a href="mushroom%20hunters">mushroom hunters</a>, according to Arora, is its beauty. Its similarity to some other (inedible or toxic) webcaps renders it risky to eat. The taste after cooking is reportedly bitter.

The colour of "C. violaceus" cannot be converted to a <a href="dye">dye</a>, unlike that of some other "Cortinarius" species, such as "<a href="Cortinarius%20sanguineus">C. sanguineus</a>" and "<a href="Cortinarius%20semisanguineus">C. semisanguineus</a>". The colour is caused by an elusive pigment that has been difficult to isolate; its identity was not known until 1998. It is an iron (III) complex of (R)-3′,4′-dihydroxy-β-phenylalanine [(R)-β-dopa]. It dissolves in water, turning the liquid dark purple before fading to blackish-grey. "C. violaceus" fruiting bodies contain around 100 times more iron than those of most other fungi. "Cortinarius violaceus" <a href="extract">extract</a> demonstrates an inhibitory activity against <a href="cysteine%20protease">cysteine protease</a>.

Harriet Bosse

Harriet Sofie Bosse (19 February 1878 – 2 November 1961) was a Swedish–Norwegian actress. A celebrity in her own day, Bosse is today most commonly remembered as the third wife of the playwright <a href="August%20Strindberg">August Strindberg</a>. Bosse began her career in a minor company run by her forceful older sister Alma Fahlstrøm in Kristiania (now <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>, the capital of Norway). Having secured an engagement at the <a href="Royal%20Dramatic%20Theatre">Royal Dramatic Theatre</a> ("Dramaten"), the main drama venue of Sweden's capital <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, Bosse caught the attention of Strindberg with her intelligent acting and exotic "oriental" appearance.

After a whirlwind courtship, which unfolds in detail in Strindberg's letters and diary, Strindberg and Bosse were married in 1901, when he was 52 and she 23. Strindberg wrote a number of major roles for Bosse during their short and stormy relationship, especially in 1900–01, a period of great creativity and productivity for him. Like his previous two marriages, the relationship failed as a result of Strindberg's jealousy, which some biographers have characterized as <a href="paranoia">paranoid</a>. The spectrum of Strindberg's feelings about Bosse, ranging from worship to rage, is reflected in the roles he wrote for her to play, or as portraits of her. Despite her real-life role as <a href="muse">muse</a> to Strindberg, she remained an independent artist.

Bosse married Swedish actor in 1908, and Swedish screen actor, director, and matinee idol <a href="Edvin%20Adolphson">Edvin Adolphson</a> in 1927. All three of her marriages ended in divorce after a few years, leaving her with a daughter by Strindberg and a son by Wingård. On retiring after a high-profile acting career based in Stockholm, she returned to her roots in Oslo.

Bosse was born in Norway's capital Kristiania, today called <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>, as the thirteenth of fourteen children of Anne-Marie and Johann Heinrich Bosse. Her German father was a publisher and bookseller, and his business led to the family's alternating residence in Kristiania and Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. Bosse was to experience some confusion of national identity throughout her life, and to take the rail trip between the cities many times. A bold, independent child, she first made the journey alone when she was only six years old.

Two of Bosse's older sisters, <a href="Alma%20Fahlstr%C3%B8m">Alma</a> (1863–1947) and <a href="Dagmar%20M%C3%B6ller">Dagmar</a> (1866–1954), were already successful performers when Harriet was a small child. Inspired by these role models, Harriet began her acting career in a Norwegian touring company run by her sister Alma and Alma's husband <a href="Johan%20Fahlstr%C3%B8m">Johan Fahlstrøm</a> (1867–1938). Invited to play Juliet in "<a href="Romeo%20and%20Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a>", the eighteen-year-old Harriet reported in a letter to her sister Inez that she had been paralysed by stage-fright before the premiere, but had then taken delight in the performance, the curtain-calls, and the way people stared at her in the street the next day. Alma was Harriet's first and only—rather authoritarian—acting teacher. Their harmonious and sisterly teacher–pupil relationship became strained when Alma discovered that her husband Johan and Harriet were having an affair. Both Bosse parents were now dead, and Harriet, ordered by Alma to leave, used a modest legacy from her father to finance studies in Stockholm, <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, and Paris.

The Paris stage—at that time in dynamic conflict between traditional and experimental production styles—was inspirational for Bosse and convinced her that the low-key realistic acting style in which she was training herself was the right choice. Returning to <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, she was hesitant as to whether she should carve out a career in Stockholm, with its greater opportunities, or in Kristiania, to which she had closer emotional ties. In spite of the disadvantage of speaking Swedish with a Norwegian accent, Bosse let herself be persuaded by her opera-singer sister Dagmar to try her luck in Stockholm. She applied for a place at the <a href="Royal%20Dramatic%20Theatre">Royal Dramatic Theatre</a> ("Dramaten"), the main drama venue of Stockholm, governed by the conservative tastes of <a href="King%20Oscar%20II">King Oscar II</a> and his personal advisors. After working hard at <a href="elocution">elocution</a> lessons to improve her Swedish, which was Dramaten's condition for employing her, Bosse was eventually to become famous on the Swedish stage for her beautiful speaking voice and precise articulation. Having trained her Swedish to a high level, she was engaged by Dramaten in 1899, where the sensation of the day was the innovative play "<a href="Gustaf%20Vasa%20%28play%29">Gustaf Vasa</a>" by August Strindberg.

Although Bosse was a successful professional, she is chiefly remembered as the third wife of Swedish dramatist <a href="August%20Strindberg">August Strindberg</a> (1849–1912). Strindberg, an important influence on the development of modern drama, had become nationally known in the 1870s as an angry young socialist <a href="muckraker">muckraker</a> and had risen to fame with his satire on the Swedish <a href="The%20Establishment">establishment</a>, "<a href="The%20Red%20Room%20%28Strindberg%29">The Red Room</a>" (1879). In the 1890s, he had suffered a long and miserable psychotic interlude, known as the "<a href="Inferno%20%28Strindberg%29">"Inferno"</a> Crisis", and, emerging from this ordeal, he remained marked by it. He turned from <a href="naturalism%20%28literature%29">naturalism</a> to <a href="symbolism%20%28arts%29">symbolism</a> in his prolific literary output, and his convictions and interests at the turn of the twentieth century focused less on politics and more on <a href="Theosophy%20%28Blavatskian%29">theosophy</a>, <a href="mysticism">mysticism</a>, and the <a href="occult">occult</a>. When Bosse met him in 1899–1900, he was, at age 51, at the height of his creative powers, his name "red-hot" on the stage.

Strindberg had the reputation of a <a href="misogyny">misogynist</a>, something which all of his wives stoutly denied. Bosse wrote in an unpublished statement which she left to her daughter with Strindberg, Anne-Marie: "During the years I knew and was married to Strindberg I saw only a completely natural, kind, honorable, faithful man—a 'gentleman'". However, all of Strindberg's marriages were blighted by his jealousy and a sensitivity which has sometimes been considered <a href="paranoia">paranoid</a> and <a href="delusional">delusional</a>.

 Bosse later published Strindberg's letters from their courtship and marriage. Incidents narrated in those letters and in Bosse's own interspersed comments have been analysed at length by biographers and psychiatrists, and have become part of the "Strindberg legend". Even before their first meeting, Bosse had been inspired by the newness and freshness of Strindberg's pioneering plays; an <a href="iconoclasm">iconoclast</a> and <a href="Far-left%20politics">radical</a> with two turbulent marriages already behind him presented an intriguing and irresistible mix to her.

Strindberg was susceptible to strong, independent career women, as well as to dainty, delicate-looking young girls; like his first and second wives—<a href="Siri%20von%20Essen">Siri von Essen</a> and <a href="Frida%20Uhl">Frida Uhl</a>—Bosse combined these qualities. He was entranced when he saw the dark, exotic-looking, petite twenty-two-year-old Bosse (who was often cast in <a href="sprite%20%28creature%29">sprite</a> roles or what were conceptualized as "Oriental" roles) play her first major part, an impish <a href="Puck%20%28Shakespeare%29">Puck</a> in "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>". He immediately picked her out as a suitable actress for the part of The Lady in his coming play "<a href="To%20Damascus">To Damascus</a>", and invited her to his bachelor establishment to discuss the role. At this famous first meeting, Strindberg, according to Bosse's narrative of the event, met her at the door all smiles and charm. Offering her wine, flowers, and beautifully arranged fruit, he shared with her his fascination with <a href="alchemy">alchemy</a>, showing her a golden brown mixture he told her was gold he had made. When she got up to leave, Bosse claims Strindberg asked for the feather in her hat to use for writing his plays. Bosse gave it to him, and he used this feather, with a steel nib insert, to write all his dramas during their marriage. It is now in the <a href="Strindberg%20Museum">Strindberg Museum</a> in Stockholm.

Strindberg wooed Bosse by sending her books about theosophy and the occult, by attempting to mould her mind, and by furthering her career. Throwing himself into writing plays with central parts he considered suitable for her, he tried to persuade her to act them, and the Dramaten management to cast her in them. Bosse asserts in her edition of the "Letters" that she tended to hang back, as did the management, being in agreement that she lacked the experience for major and complex roles. Strindberg, a power in the theatre, nevertheless often prevailed. The role of Eleonora in "Easter" (1901), which intimidated Bosse by its sensitivity and delicacy, but which she finally undertook to play, turned out to be Bosse's most successful and beloved role, and a turning-point in Bosse's and Strindberg's relationship. They became engaged in March 1901, during the rehearsals of "Easter", in what in Bosse's narrative may be the best-known incident of the Strindberg legend. Bosse relates how she went to see Strindberg to ask him to give the part to a more experienced actress, but he assured her she would be perfect for it. "Then he placed his hands on my shoulders, looked at me long and ardently, and asked: 'Would you like to have a little child with me, Miss Bosse?' I made a curtsey and answered, as though hypnotized: 'Yes, thank you!'—and we were engaged."

Bosse and Strindberg were married on 6 May 1901. Strindberg insisted that Bosse bring none of her possessions to the home he had furnished for her, creating a "setting in which to nurture and dominate her". In this setting, his taste in interior decoration was revealed to be <a href="King%20Oscar%20II">Oscarian</a> and old-fashioned, with pedestals, aspidistras, and dining-room furniture in hideous imitation of German renaissance, to Bosse's modern judgment.
Striving towards the life beyond, Strindberg explained, he could permit nothing in the apartment that would lead the thoughts towards the earthly and material. In her comments in the "Letters", Bosse described with loyalty and affection Strindberg's protectiveness and his efforts to bring his young wife with him along his own spiritual paths; nevertheless, she chafed under these efforts, pointing out that she herself, at 22, was not even remotely finished with this world. Increasingly <a href="agoraphobia">agoraphobic</a>, Strindberg attempted to overcome his anxieties and allow his young wife the summer excursions she longed for. He planned sunny drives in hired <a href="victoria%20%28carriage%29">victorias</a>, but often the mystical "Powers" which governed him intervened. A crisis came as early as June 1901, when Strindberg arranged, and then at the last moment called off, a honeymoon trip to Germany and Switzerland. Bosse wrote in the "Letters" that she had nothing to do but stay at home and choke down the tears while Strindberg attempted consolation by giving her a <a href="Baedeker">Baedeker</a> "to read a trip in".
The cancelled journey was the beginning of the end. A crying, defiant Bosse went off by herself to the seaside resort <a href="Hornb%C3%A6k">Hornbæk</a> in <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, a much shorter trip, but to her senses, a delightfully refreshing one. There, she was soon followed by Strindberg's letters, full of agonized remorse at having given her pain, and then by Strindberg himself, steeling himself to bear the social life Bosse relished. However, the relationship quickly foundered on jealousy and suspicion, as when Strindberg struck a photographer over the head with his stick, unable to endure any attention to Bosse. In August, when Bosse discovered that she was pregnant, even Strindberg's delight (he was a fond parent of the four children of his previous marriages) could not save a marriage full of distrust and accusation. This was illustrated in Strindberg's increasingly frantic letters to Bosse When their daughter Anne-Marie was born on 25 March 1902, they were already living apart. "For the sake of us both it is best that I do not return", wrote Bosse in a letter to Strindberg. "A continuation of life together with suspicion of every word, every act of mine, would be the end of me." At her insistence, Strindberg began divorce proceedings.

The relationship of Strindberg and Bosse was highly dramatic. Strindberg would lurch back and forth from adoration of Bosse as the regenerator of his creativity ("lovely, amiable, and kind") to a wild jealousy (calling her "a small, nasty woman", "evil", "stupid", "black", "arrogant", "venomous", and "whore"). His letters show that Bosse inspired several important characters in his plays, especially during the course of 1901, and that he manipulated her by promising to pull strings so that she could play them. During the brief, intense, creative 1901 period, the roles Strindberg wrote as artistic vehicles for Bosse, or that were based on their relationship, reflect this combination of adoration and "suspicion of every word, every act". Carla Waal counts eight minor and six major roles written for Bosse to act, or as portraits of her, several of them classics of Western theatre history. The major roles enumerated by Waal are The Lady in "<a href="To%20Damascus">To Damascus</a>" (1900; mainly already written when Bosse and Strindberg met, but used between them to enhance their intimacy); Eleonora in "Easter" (1901; modelled on Strindberg's sister Elisabeth, but intended for Bosse to star in); Henriette in "Crimes and Crimes" (1901); Swan White in "Swan White" (1901); Christina in "Queen Christina" (1901); and Indra's daughter in "<a href="A%20Dream%20Play">A Dream Play</a>" (1902). The years refer to dates of publication; Bosse never played in "Swan White", even though Strindberg kept proposing it, and though she was many years later to describe this play as Strindberg's wedding present to her.
Strindberg claimed that "Queen Christina" was an "explanation" of Bosse's character as being that of an actress in real life, flirtatious and deceitful. In his influential Strindberg biography, Lagercrantz describes this play as a synopsis of the entire course of the Bosse–Strindberg marriage. He sees the courtiers as representing various stages of Strindberg's own emotions: Tott, in the first glow of love; de la Gardie, betrayed but loyal; Oxenstierna, who has rejected her. Each of the three men has words to speak which Strindberg himself had spoken to Bosse.

"A Dream Play" is positioned at the <a href="median">median</a> of Strindberg's series of portrayals of his own marriage, the Bosse role imbued with both light and darkness. With its associative dream structure, this play is a milestone of <a href="modernist">modernist</a> drama, described by Strindberg as a lawless reflection of The Dreamer's (Strindberg's) consciousness, limited only by his imagination which "spins and weaves new patterns… on an insignificant basis of reality". Agnes, played by and representing Bosse, is the daughter of the <a href="Historical%20Vedic%20religion">Vedic</a> god <a href="Indra">Indra</a>, descending to earth to observe human life and bring its disappointments to the attention of her divine father. The "Oriental" aspect of the play is based on Bosse's dark, exotic looks. Yet she is also drawn into mere humanity and into a claustrophobic marriage to The Lawyer, one of the versions of The Dreamer and, thereby, of Strindberg. Shut up indoors by a possessive husband, Agnes can not breathe; she despondently watches the servant working to exclude light and air from the house by pasting insulating strips of paper along the windows' edges. Recognizably, the "insignificant basis of reality" of Agnes' marriage to The Lawyer is the frustration of the newly married Bosse, yearning for fresh air, sunshine, and travel but fobbed off with a Baedeker.

Both before and after the divorce from Strindberg, Bosse was a <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> celebrity in her own right. Her independence and self-supporting status gained her a reputation for being strong-willed and opinionated, insisting on, and receiving, high pay and significant roles. She left Dramaten with its conventional repertoire and began working at <a href="Albert%20Ranft">Albert Ranft</a>'s <a href="Swedish%20Theatre%20%28Stockholm%29">Swedish Theatre</a>, where she and the skillful but more modest actor (Anders) Gunnar Wingård (1878–1912) formed a popular co-star team. She travelled frequently, particularly for guest performances in <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>, leaving little Anne-Marie with Strindberg, a competent and affectionate father. In 1907, Bosse made theatrical history as Indra's daughter in Strindberg's epoch-making "Dream Play". She and Strindberg met weekly for dinner at his house, and remained lovers until she severed connections in preparation for her marriage with Gunnar Wingård in 1908. In 1909 the Wingårds had a son, Bo. This marriage was also brief, ending in divorce in 1912. According to rumour, the cause of the divorce was Wingård's infidelity. However, Strindberg also heard gossip that Wingård's large debts threatened Bosse's finances.

In 1911, a divorced woman with two children to care for and support, Bosse returned to <a href="Dramaten">Dramaten</a>. Strindberg was at that time fatally ill with cancer; he died on 14 May 1912. 1912 was altogether a year of death and disaster for the Bosse and Strindberg families: Alma Fahlstrøm's son Arne went down with the "<a href="RMS%20Titanic">Titanic</a>" on 15 April; Strindberg's first wife Siri von Essen died later the same month; von Essen's and Strindberg's daughter Greta, a promising young actress, was killed in a train crash in June; and Bosse's divorced husband Gunnar Wingård shot himself on 7 October. Strindberg's funeral was a national event. Gunnar Wingård, a popular and charming actor, was also the subject of public grief. Throughout these shattering events, which left both her children fatherless, Bosse kept up her busy schedule, apart from a few days off, distraught and grief-stricken, after Wingård's suicide. For months after it, she received anonymous letters and threatening phone-calls, blaming her for Wingård's depression and death.

Bosse's third marriage, 1927–32, was to <a href="Edvin%20Adolphson">Edvin Adolphson</a> (1893–1979), fifteen years her junior. Adolphson had abandoned his stage career in order to become instead a film director and one of the best-known Swedish film actors, a ruggedly handsome matinée idol whose screen persona Nils Beyer referred to as a combination of "<a href="apache%20%28gang%29">apache</a>, <a href="gangster">gangster</a> and <a href="male%20prostitution">gigolo</a>".

Bosse made two films, ambitiously shot and directed and based on novels by well-known writers. The artistic achievement of "<a href="Sons%20of%20Ingmar">Sons of Ingmar</a>" (1919) has been highly praised. Directed by and co-starring <a href="Victor%20Sj%C3%B6str%C3%B6m">Victor Sjöström</a>, it was based on a novel by Swedish <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize</a> winner <a href="Selma%20Lagerl%C3%B6f">Selma Lagerlöf</a>; many years later, <a href="Ingmar%20Bergman">Ingmar Bergman</a> referred to "Sons of Ingmar" as a "magnificent, remarkable film" and acknowledged his own debt to Sjöström. Bosse, who played the female lead Brita, called "Sons of Ingmar" "the only worthwhile Swedish film I was involved in." However, the film failed to give her career the kind of fresh start that the Swedish film industry had given Edvin Adolphson, and it was seventeen years before she made another film. This was "Bombi Bitt and I" (1936), her only <a href="talkie">talkie</a>, based on <a href="Fritiof%20Nilsson%20Piraten">Fritiof Nilsson Piraten</a>'s popular first novel with the same title and directed by Gösta Rodin. "Bombi Bitt" was a successful, though more lightweight, production with a smaller Bosse role ("Franskan").

After many years of ambitious and successful free-lance acting, Bosse found her options narrowing in the 1930s. The <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> brought her economic hardship, and, even though she looked younger than her age, most important women's roles were out of her age range. Her technique was still often praised, but also sometimes perceived as old-fashioned and mannered, in comparison with the more ensemble-oriented style of the times. Finding herself unneeded by any Swedish repertory theatre, she only managed to return as a member of Dramaten by means of skillful persuasion and pointed reminders of her long history there. A humble employee at a humble salary, she played only fifteen roles, all minor, during her last ten years at Dramaten, 1933–43.

Retiring from the stage during World War II, Bosse considered moving back to Norway's capital Oslo, the home of her childhood and youth. Both her children had settled there. The move was delayed for ten years, during which she travelled whenever possible, and when it took place in 1955, she perceived it to be a mistake. Her brother <a href="Ewald%20Bosse">Ewald</a>'s death in 1956 left her the only survivor of the fourteen children of Anne-Marie and Johann Heinrich Bosse. "How I long desperately for Stockholm", she wrote to a friend in 1958. "My whole life is there." She became chronically melancholy, enduring failing health and bitter memories of the final phase of her career at Dramaten. She died on 2 November 1961 in Oslo.

Bosse always guarded her privacy, so much so that the memoir she wrote of her life with Strindberg was deemed to be too uninterestingly discreet to be publishable.

Irish Thoroughbred

Irish Thoroughbred is American author <a href="Nora%20Roberts">Nora Roberts</a>'s <a href="debut%20novel">debut novel</a>, originally published by Silhouette in January 1981 as a <a href="category%20romance">category romance</a>. Like other category romances, the novel was less than 200 pages and was intended to be on sale for only one month. It proved so popular that it was repackaged as a stand-alone romance and reprinted multiple times. Roberts wrote two sequels, "Irish Rebel" and "Irish Rose".

Roberts drew on her Irish heritage to create an Irish heroine, Adelia "Dee" Cunnane. In the novel, Dee moves to the United States, where her sick uncle arranges for her to marry his employer, wealthy American horsebreeder Travis Grant. Although the early part of their relationship is marked by frequent arguments and misunderstanding, by the end of the story Travis and Dee reconcile. According to critic <a href="Mary%20Ellen%20Snodgrass">Mary Ellen Snodgrass</a>, the couple's transformation from adversaries to a loving married couple is one of many formulaic elements in the book. Although the protagonists adhered to many stereotypes common to romance novels of the 1980s, Roberts's heroine is more independent and feisty than most heroines of the time. This book's popularity helped pave the way for other romance authors to experiment with heroes and heroines who had greater economic and emotional parity.

In 1979, <a href="Nora%20Roberts">Nora Roberts</a> was a stay-at-home mother with two small children. Stranded during a blizzard with nothing to read, Roberts amused herself by writing down one of the stories in her head. After developing her idea into a novel-length contemporary <a href="romance%20novel">romance</a>, she continued writing and soon finished six more manuscripts. Roberts submitted her work to <a href="Harlequin%20Enterprises">Harlequin Enterprises</a>, a Canadian company considered the foremost publisher of romance novels in North America. Harlequin typically published works by British authors set in the <a href="British%20Commonwealth">British Commonwealth</a>, but in 1975 Harlequin relaxed its criteria slightly and purchased several novels from American <a href="Janet%20Dailey">Janet Dailey</a>. Unconvinced that the market would appreciate novels such as Dailey's – all featuring American protagonists and set in the United States – Harlequin was unwilling to further expose itself to risk. As a result, the company quickly rejected Roberts's work; one editor explained that "they already had their American writer."

In an effort to take advantage of the untapped talent of American writers, in 1980 <a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster">Simon & Schuster</a> created a new imprint, Silhouette Books, to serve as a counterpart to Harlequin. Roberts sent her seventh manuscript, "Irish Thoroughbred", unsolicited to the new company. Nancy Jackson, the acquiring editor at Silhouette, pulled the manuscript from the <a href="slush%20pile">slush pile</a> and was impressed. She offered Roberts a contract, leaving the writer "awestruck".

The novel follows the relationship between Irishwoman Adelia "Dee" Cunnane and American Travis Grant. As the story begins, the young and penniless Dee emigrates to the United States to live with her uncle, Paddy, who works on a large horse farm. Dee's love for animals is evident, and she is given a job working alongside her uncle. Dee has a fiery temper and often argues with Travis, the wealthy farm owner; many of their arguments lead to passionate embraces. Travis later rescues Dee from an attempted rape.

When Paddy suffers a heart attack, he becomes very concerned about his mortality and Dee's future. He becomes overwrought and insists that Travis take care of Dee. After privately agreeing to a temporary <a href="marriage%20of%20convenience">marriage of convenience</a>, Travis and Dee exchange vows in Paddy's hospital room. As the story progresses, the protagonists become increasingly unhappy, with neither willing to admit their love for the other.

Although still unwilling to vocalize their feelings, Dee and Travis appear more confident in their relationship after they finally <a href="Consummation">consummate</a> their marriage. Soon, however, Dee's insecurities are exploited by Travis's sophisticated former girlfriend, Margot, who has returned to the area to win him back. Dee runs away. Travis follows, and the two confess their love and resolve to make their marriage work.

"Irish Thoroughbred" was initially published as a category <a href="romance%20novel">romance novel</a>. Books in this genre are short – usually between 175 and 200 pages, or about 55,000 words – and are published in clearly delineated lines, or categories. Although each category romance novel is unique, it is required to conform to the general parameters that define its line. The small number of books published in each line every month are numbered sequentially within the line. "Irish Thoroughbred" was number 81 in the Silhouette Romance line. Novels in this line espouse more traditional family values and place greater emphasis on the characters' emotions rather than their physical needs. Although these novels often describe sexual tension between the main characters, sexual intercourse is only described within the bounds of marriage.

Category romances are generally only available for a limited time, remaining on a bookseller's shelves until they are sold out or until the next month's titles are released. Popular category romances can be repacked as stand-alone romance novels; "Irish Thoroughbred" received five printings by 1984. In 2000, the book was paired with its sequel, "Irish Rose", and republished as "Irish Hearts", with an initial <a href="print%20run">print run</a> of one million copies. This coincided with the release of a second sequel, "Irish Rebel", which focused on Travis and Dee's daughter.

Silhouette editors were originally concerned that the novel was too ethnic. Like many of her early novels, Roberts's debut featured characters who shared the Irish culture in which Roberts had been raised. The opening pages, alluding to the introductory scene of <a href="Daphne%20du%20Maurier">Daphne du Maurier</a>'s "<a href="Rebecca%20%28novel%29">Rebecca</a>", detailed the heroine's awed reaction to the extravagance of an American estate. This plotline of an impoverished Irishwoman's surprise at the wealth of America essentially reframed the <a href="Irish%20American">Irish emigration to the United States</a> of the 19th century. 

According to literary critic <a href="Mary%20Ellen%20Snodgrass">Mary Ellen Snodgrass</a>, "Irish Thoroughbred" is not as polished as later Roberts works. Snodgrass cites many predictable elements, including the core "confrontation between an overconfident male and an assertive girl-woman". Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, romance novel heroines were generally "trembling virgins", of an inferior class and power level than the hero. The hero often was very rich and powerful, while the heroine worked in traditional, subordinate, female roles, such as governess or secretary. The heroine of "Irish Thoroughbred" conformed to this pattern in part, by being sexually inexperienced, immature, and poor, but Roberts deliberately deviated from the rest of the stereotype by providing her with a hot-tempered and independent personality. Her later books have continued in the same vein. As Roberts explains, "My heroine may have problems, she may be vulnerable, but she has to be strong, she has to be intelligent. She has to be independent and so does he, or I'm not interested in telling their stories." The popularity of this book and Roberts's subsequent novels helped transform the genre, making authors more willing to give heroes and heroines economic and emotional parity.

Despite the greater independence that Roberts allotted her heroine, Dee is trapped within a patriarchal culture in which her uncle and prospective husband arrange her future. The arranged marriage and ensuing events, including the misunderstanding and her running away, were common plot elements for romance novels at that time. Dee's reactions, however, veered from the formulaic. Her retorts brought to mind the "quippy one-upmanship of feminist literature". When a man attempts to rape her, Dee responds with a series of sharp comments, calling him, among other things, "a filthy pig of a man", before succumbing to the traditional feminine response of fainting in horror.

Roberts also includes the motif of jealousy. Dee is given a rival for Travis's affections – an over-sophisticated woman who is essentially Dee's antithesis. Roberts reused this plot point in other novels, including "Song of the West".

Super Meat Boy

Super Meat Boy is an <a href="indie%20game">independent</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> designed by <a href="Edmund%20McMillen">Edmund McMillen</a> and <a href="Tommy%20Refenes">Tommy Refenes</a>, and developed by "Team Meat". It is the successor to "Meat Boy", McMillen and Jonathan McEntee's 2008 <a href="Adobe%20Flash">flash game</a>. The game was released on the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> through <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Arcade">Xbox Live Arcade</a> in October 2010, on <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> in November 2010, on <a href="OS%20X">OS X</a> a year later in November 2011, on <a href="Linux">Linux</a> in December 2011 as a part of the <a href="Humble%20Indie%20Bundle%23Humble%20Indie%20Bundle%234">Humble Indie Bundle #4</a> (in May 2012 as a part of the <a href="Humble%20Indie%20Bundle%20V">Humble Indie Bundle #5</a>), on <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a> in October 2015, on <a href="Wii%20U">Wii U</a> in May 2016, and for the <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> in January 2018.

In the game, the player controls Meat Boy, a red, cube-shaped character, as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend, Bandage Girl, from the game's antagonist Dr. <a href="Fetus">Fetus</a>. The gameplay is characterized by fine control and split-second timing, as the player runs and jumps through over 300 hazardous <a href="Level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a> while avoiding obstacles. Additional player-created levels are available for free download.

Development of the game began in January 2009. McMillen worked on level design and artwork, while Refenes <a href="Computer%20coding">coded</a> the game; it was <a href="Game%20testing">tested</a> primarily by the pair and their families. Initially intended for release in early 2010 for <a href="Personal%20computers">personal computers</a> and the <a href="WiiWare">WiiWare</a> download service, the <a href="Release%20date">release date</a> was pushed back as the design was changed to include more levels, yet exclude <a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer modes</a>. The WiiWare version was canceled due to the service's technical limitations, and instead the first release was on the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>. The music for the game was created by <a href="Danny%20Baranowsky">Danny Baranowsky</a>, who had also composed the music for the original "Meat Boy". The soundtrack was released as an album, and music from "Super Meat Boy" was released as <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> for "<a href="Rock%20Band%203">Rock Band 3</a>".

The game was critically acclaimed; in 2010, it received awards for "Most Challenging Game" from <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, and for "Best Downloadable Game" from <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> and <a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a>. Critics lauded the game's precise controls, <a href="Retro%20style">retro artwork</a>, and soundtrack. Reviewers generally praised the game's challenge, although some warned that not all players would appreciate the high level of difficulty (possibly a throwback to games of yore). The game was a commercial and economic success, and sold more than one million copies by January 2012.

A sequel to the game, "<a href="Super%20Meat%20Boy%20Forever">Super Meat Boy Forever</a>", is in development, for release in April 2019.

"Super Meat Boy" is a <a href="platform%20game">platform game</a> in which players control a small, dark red, cube-shaped character named Meat Boy, who must save his cube-shaped, heavily bandaged girlfriend Bandage Girl from the evil scientist Dr. Fetus. The game is divided into chapters, which together contain over 300 <a href="Level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a>. Players attempt to reach the end of each level, represented by Bandage Girl, while avoiding crumbling blocks, saw blades, and various other fatal obstacles. The player can jump and run on platforms, and can jump off or slide down walls. The core gameplay requires fine control and split-second timing, and was compared to, regarding both gameplay and level of difficulty, traditional platform games such as "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Bros.">Super Mario Bros.</a>" and "<a href="Ghosts%20%27n%20Goblins">Ghosts 'n Goblins</a>".

Levels in each chapter can be played in any order, but a certain number of levels need to be completed to access the <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss</a> stage, which unlocks the next chapter if cleared. The player has an unlimited number of attempts to complete each level. If Meat Boy is killed, he immediately restarts the level, though the ornamental red meat juice left behind on surfaces that the player has touched remains. A replay function, which may be accessed after a level is completed, simultaneously shows all the player's attempts to complete the level. Completing a level within a certain time earns an "A+" grade, which unlocks a harder alternate version of the level in the "dark world", an optional set of especially difficult levels. Hidden stages called warp zones are accessed by finding portals in specific levels. These warp zones feature bonus levels that have either the art style of older video games and a limit of three lives, or are patterned after another indie video game such as "<a href="Castle%20Crashers">Castle Crashers</a>" or "<a href="Braid%20%28video%20game%29">Braid</a>". The player may control characters other than Meat Boy, many of whom first appeared in other independent video games. Each character has different attributes, such as <a href="Commander%20Video">Commander Video</a>'s ability to momentarily float in midair. These characters can be unlocked by collecting <a href="item%20%28gaming%29">bandage items</a> placed throughout the game's levels or completing certain warp zones. Some bandages can only be collected by using certain characters. Some levels, such as warp zones and boss levels, can only be played with specific characters. The available characters vary depending on the version of the game played.

The <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Arcade">Xbox Live Arcade</a> (XBLA) version features an unlockable mode called "Teh Internets", which is updated with new, free, officially curated levels. The PC version has a "Super Meat World" section, which allows users to play and rate additional levels that players have created with a level editor. This editor was released in May 2011. Players can also access an unsupported developer mode inside the game to edit their own levels using the "rough" tools that Team Meat used to create the game.

The original "Meat Boy" is an <a href="Adobe%20Flash">Adobe Flash game</a> created by <a href="Edmund%20McMillen">Edmund McMillen</a> and programmed by Jonathan McEntee. The game was developed over a three-week period, and was released on <a href="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> on October 5, 2008. By April 2009, it had garnered over 840,000 views at Newgrounds, and 8 million overall. A map pack for the Flash version was released on December 8, 2008. McMillen began development of "Super Meat Boy" after <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> and <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> requested that he make a game for their download services, <a href="WiiWare">WiiWare</a> and Xbox Live Arcade, as they were impressed by the success of his Flash games "<a href="Aether%20%28video%20game%29">Aether</a>" and "Meat Boy". At the time, he was working with <a href="Tommy%20Refenes">Tommy Refenes</a> on a Flash game titled "Grey Matter". Although McMillen initially pitched the companies a sequel to "<a href="Gish%20%28video%20game%29">Gish</a>" or "Aether", the pair decided to form Team Meat and work on an expanded version of "Meat Boy" instead. Team Meat also includes soundtrack composer <a href="Danny%20Baranowsky">Danny Baranowsky</a> and sound effects designer Jordan Fehr. According to the developers, "Super Meat Boy" is "a big throwback to a lot of super hardcore <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">NES</a> classics like "Ghosts'n Goblins", "<a href="Mega%20Man%20%28video%20game%29">Mega Man</a>", and the Japanese version of """, with the plot written as "a mash-up of every videogame story from the early 90s". The game was explicitly designed by the team to be reminiscent of "Super Mario Bros.", and McMillen considered it a tribute to <a href="Shigeru%20Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, the developer of "Super Mario Bros."

Development of "Super Meat Boy" began in January 2009. Initially announced for WiiWare and PC, the game was set to be released in the first quarter of 2010. The release date was pushed back to the fourth quarter because the developers wanted more time to create extra levels, such as the dark worlds. A picture released on Team Meat's <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> page on February 22, 2010, revealed that the game would also be released for XBLA. The next day, they announced that, while all versions would be released in the same month, the game would be released for XBLA first due to "contractual obligations". In August 2010, the developers were contacted by Microsoft with the prospect of inclusion in Microsoft's 2010 Fall GameFeast XBLA promotion two months later. As they were almost out of money, they did not believe that they could financially support themselves until the Spring event, but felt they had four months' worth of work left to complete on the game. For the final two months of development they worked daily, slept five hours a night, and frequently forgot to eat—a process that McMillen said he "would never voluntarily go through" again. According to McMillen, due to Microsoft's low expectations for the game, "Super Meat Boy" was lightly promoted. The level of promotion was not increased during the GameFeast, though the game greatly outsold the rest of the games in the event. The team described the effort required to finish the game for the promotion as "by far the biggest mistake [they] made during SMB's development". Their development struggle is depicted in the documentary "". The game was released on XBLA in October 2010 and on PCs via <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> and <a href="Direct2Drive">Direct2Drive</a> a month later. McMillen noted that the PC release was more heavily promoted than the XBLA version. A version for <a href="Mac%20OS%20X">Mac OS X</a> was released in November 2011, while another version for <a href="Linux">Linux</a> <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>s was released in December 2011 as part of the <a href="Humble%20Indie%20Bundle%23Humble%20Indie%20Bundle%234">Humble Indie Bundle #4</a> game pack.

Due to Sony's initial lack of interest in the game, Team Meat entered into contractual obligations that prohibited "Super Meat Boy" from ever being released on the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>. Despite this a version for the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a> was eventually announced The WiiWare version was canceled because the game's file size had been expanded beyond the limits imposed by Nintendo. Team Meat looked into releasing it as a retail <a href="Wii">Wii</a> game, but were told by all third-party publishers they approached that a budget title would not be profitable so late into the Wii's lifecycle. However, after Team Meat hinted it in October 2015, "Super Meat Boy" has been confirmed for the <a href="Wii%20U">Wii U</a> <a href="Nintendo%20eShop">eShop</a> via a release reel shown on the European <a href="List%20of%20Nintendo%20Direct%20presentations">Nintendo Direct</a> of March 2016. The Wii U port is handled by <a href="BlitWorks">BlitWorks</a>, a separate indie developer, and was released in 2016. Team Meat announced a <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> port in August 2017, and it is releasing on January 11, 2018. The Switch version included a platform-exclusive "Race Mode", allowing two players on the Switch's split-screen and using separate Joy-Con to race through sets of levels. This mode was added to the Windows version in October 2018.

A limited edition retail version of the PC game was released in April 2011. It included bonuses such as behind-the-scenes videos, a sample disc of the game's music, and a "Super Meat Boy" <a href="comic%20book">comic</a>. In 2012 Team Meat began prototyping an <a href="iOS">iOS</a> and <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> version of the game. The game is intended to be a different take on the "Super Meat Boy" concept that is more adapted to touch-screen controls than a direct port would be. This game was later confirmed to be titled "<a href="Super%20Meat%20Boy%20Forever">Super Meat Boy: Forever</a>", which is slated for a 2018 release. Later Team Meat released two images of the new game one with the new graphics and other with the new chapter named The Green Hills.

Team Meat released several pieces of merchandise related to "Super Meat Boy". These include "Super Meat Boy Handheld", an <a href="iOS">iOS</a> app released on April 3, 2010 and styled on a <a href="Tiger%20Electronics">Tiger Electronics handheld</a>. It was released as a joke after Refenes' game "Zits & Giggles" was removed from the <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a> following a statement by Refenes that likened the <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a> to a Tiger handheld. McMillen has released a "Super Meat Boy" microgame for "<a href="WarioWare%20D.I.Y.">WarioWare D.I.Y.</a>" Team Meat sells charms, plush toys, and posters related to the game, as well as T-shirts, stickers, <a href="stress%20ball">stress ball</a>s, and a limited edition "Super Meat Boy" comic. In 2011, Voxelous released a set of four "Super Meat Boy" figures of Meat Boy, Bandage Girl, Brownie, and Tofu Boy, later making figures of Commander Video, Jill, Ogmo, and Dr. Fetus.

"Super Meat Boy"s soundtrack was composed by <a href="Danny%20Baranowsky">Danny Baranowsky</a>, who previously composed the soundtracks for the indie video games "<a href="Canabalt">Canabalt</a>", "<a href="Cortex%20Command">Cortex Command</a>", and "Gravity Hook". He also composed the music for the original "Meat Boy". McMillen knew of Baranowsky's other work, and approached him late in "Meat Boy"s development, asking him to supply whatever tracks he had on hand. For the soundtrack of "Super Meat Boy", Baranowsky incorporated the music he had provided for "Meat Boy" into an expanded soundtrack. He tried to ensure that the music would accompany the action on the screen without overpowering the sound effects. Baranowsky was given complete freedom for the game's music, and retained all of the rights to it; McMillen believed that being more invested in the game would let Baranowsky express the part of him that was "manic, obsessive, complex, and full of life". McMillen feels that the soundtrack "gets your heart rate up, complements every aspect of its gameplay, and stays with you for days".

On October 26, 2010, the game's soundtrack was released as a <a href="online%20distribution">download-only</a> album via the online <a href="Bandcamp">Bandcamp</a> store titled "Super Meat Boy! Soundtrack". This release features 34 tracks and a 100-minute runtime, and includes several remixes of tracks from the game. On January 11, 2011, Baranowsky and Team Meat released a special edition soundtrack on Bandcamp as both a downloadable and physical album. This edition includes a second disc of songs not included in the original release, as well as additional remixes. The album, titled "Nice to Meat You", has a total of 73 tracks, is 2 hours 25 minutes long, and features album artwork by McMillen. Three music tracks from the game were released as downloadable content for "<a href="Rock%20Band%203">Rock Band 3</a>" in June 2011.

Baranowsky's music was not used for the PlayStation 4, Nintendo Wii U, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation Vita versions, as he "no longer [had] a working relationship with Team Meat" and they could not agree on licensing terms. Instead, those versions of the game feature a soundtrack composed by Ridiculon (Matthias Bossi and Jon Evans), David "Scattle" Scatliffe, and <a href="Laura%20Shigihara">Laura Shigihara</a>, who have previously worked on games such as "", "<a href="Hotline%20Miami">Hotline Miami</a>", and "<a href="Plants%20vs.%20Zombies">Plants vs. Zombies</a>" respectively. A soundtrack album for the new music, titled "Songs in the Key of Meat: Music from SMB 5th Anniversary", was released on Bandcamp on October 6, 2015. On April 13, 2017, Tommy Refenes introduced the alternative soundtrack on the PC port.

"Nice to Meat You" track list

"Super Meat Boy" received critical acclaim. After being showcased at the <a href="Penny%20Arcade%20Expo">Penny Arcade Expo</a> 2010, "Super Meat Boy" was declared Game of the Show by <a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a> and nominated for the same award by <a href="Machinima.com">Machinima.com</a>. The game received nominations for the Grand Prize and Excellence in Audio awards at the 2010 <a href="Independent%20Games%20Festival">Independent Games Festival</a>. It won the award for Most Challenging Game in <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Best of 2010 awards, and received nominations for Best Soundtrack and Best Retro Design. It was voted <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Best Downloadable Console Game of 2010, and won the Best Downloadable Game award from <a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a>. Sales were strong, with nearly 140,000 units of the Xbox 360 version sold by the end of 2010. The Steam and Xbox 360 versions had sold over 600,000 copies combined by April 2011; 400,000 of these sales were through Steam. On January 3, 2012, Team Meat announced on Twitter that the game had surpassed 1,000,000 sales.

Critics praised "Super Meat Boy"s platforming elements, and often commented on the game's difficulty. "<a href="X-Play">X-Play</a>" reviewer Alexandra Hall said the game had "riveting platforming action", and added that ""Super Meat Boy"s designers are masters of their craft." Henry Gilbert of <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> felt the platforming was "perfect". He wrote that "while it's always tough and demanding, it never feels cheap, or like the game is cheating you." A reviewer from GameTrailers stated that "the difficulty rides the perfect line between driving you utterly bonkers when you fail and making you feel like a platform pro when you succeed". <a href="Joystiq">Joystiq</a>'s Richard Mitchell echoed other reviewers' comments: ""Super Meat Boy" is tough, as tough as the toughest nails in the toughest universe." Gilbert cited the level of difficulty, which he believed made the game inaccessible to some players, as his reason for not awarding the game a perfect score. Tom McShea of GameSpot praised the game's "precise control", "excellent level design", and "smooth difficulty curve". Reviewer Tom Bramwell of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> warned that "Super Meat Boy" is "a hard game. It should make you want to throw the pad across the room".

Critics gave high marks to the game's retro art direction and presentation. <a href="Official%20Xbox%20Magazine">"Official Xbox Magazine" (UK)</a>s Mike Channel appreciated the variety found in each set of levels. He stated that "while the graphics may look crude, the presentation is exceptional. Each level has a distinct visual style." Daemon Hatfield, a reviewer for IGN, noted the uniqueness of the game's visual presentation. He commented that the warp zone levels pay tribute to classic <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28third%20generation%29">8-bit</a> games, and lauded the game's soundtrack: "The rocking chiptune soundtrack is the best I've heard since "Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game"". Joe Leonard of <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> noted that the game's humor and over-the-top gameplay help to calm frustrations regarding the difficulty: ""Super Meat Boy"s greatest strength has to be how it never takes itself too seriously—as maddening as some of the levels got, I could never stay angry at the game for too long", said Leonard. <a href="MTV">MTV Multiplayer</a> reviewer Russ Frushtick praised the game's visual design. He appreciated the game's <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s, which he noted are "hand-drawn animated [shorts] which [bear] more than a passing resemblance to a classic video game intro".

While the game received high praise overall, certain publications voiced complaints. Hatfield noted that the cutscenes had low production values, stating that "they don't have the polish of the rest of the game". The reviewer for "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" mentioned "a few minor, yet-to-be-patched bugs". Eduardo Reboucas of <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a> said that "a lot of the levels in "Super Meat Boy" depend a little too much on twitch reflexes and trial-and-error memorization". He also stated that "there are some bits of toilet humor here and there that are duds", and that the game's high level of difficulty "will make most casual players shy away". Mitchell Dyer of "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" agreed, saying that certain "absurdly difficult" levels broke the flow of the game, especially in the boss levels and the later chapters.

Meat Boy has made cameo appearances in the video games "<a href="Bit.Trip%20Runner">Bit.Trip Runner</a>", "<a href="Bit.Trip%20Fate">Bit.Trip Fate</a>", and "", as well as in "<a href="Spelunky">Spelunky</a>", "", "<a href="Ori%20and%20the%20Blind%20Forest">Ori and the Blind Forest</a>", "<a href="Retro%20City%20Rampage">Retro City Rampage</a>", and "<a href="ilomilo">ilomilo</a>". A parody Flash game, "<a href="PETA%20satirical%20browser%20games">Super Tofu Boy</a>", was released by <a href="People%20for%20the%20Ethical%20Treatment%20of%20Animals">People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</a> (PETA) on December 1, 2010, to protest the game and promote <a href="veganism">veganism</a>. In response, Team Meat added its own interpretation of Tofu Boy to the PC version of the actual "Super Meat Boy" on December 2, 2010. The game's success spurred the development of the 1930s-style animated indie video game "<a href="Cuphead">Cuphead</a>".

On August 29, 2014, Team Meat announced that a sequel, "<a href="Super%20Meat%20Boy%20Forever">Super Meat Boy: Forever</a>", was in development for smartphones, tablets, and Steam. "Forever" is styled as an endless runner, though the player has additional abilities, such as combat controls, to complete levels. Levels themselves are dynamically built based on the difficulty level, and get progressively more difficult as the player completes them. The game was confirmed for release in 2018 on Microsoft Windows, <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a>, <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a>, <a href="iOS">iOS</a> and <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> systems in August 2017.

Take Ichi convoy

The was a <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Japanese</a> <a href="convoy">convoy</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The convoy left <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> on 17 April 1944, carrying two <a href="infantry">infantry</a> <a href="Division%20%28military%29">divisions</a> to reinforce Japan's defensive positions in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> and western <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>. <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> (USN) <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s attacked the convoy on 26 April and 6 May, sinking four transports and killing more than 4,000 soldiers. These losses caused the convoy to be diverted to <a href="Halmahera">Halmahera</a>, where the surviving soldiers and their equipment were unloaded.

The "Take Ichi" convoy's losses had important strategic results. The failure to bring the two divisions to their destination without loss contributed to the Japanese <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a>' decision to move Japan's defensive perimeter back by . The divisions' combat power was also blunted by their losses, and while they both saw action against <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> forces, they contributed little to Japan's attempt to defend its empire.

In September 1943, the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN) and <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> (IJA) agreed to establish defensive positions along what was termed Japan's "absolute zone of national defense". The zone's perimeter reached from the <a href="Marianas%20Islands">Marianas Islands</a> and <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Caroline Islands</a> to western <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> and the <a href="Banda%20Sea">Banda</a> and <a href="Flores%20Sea">Flores Sea</a>s. At this time there were few Army units in the area, and it was decided to move combat units from <a href="China">China</a> and <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a> to protect the air bases which formed the basis of Japan's defensive plans. The movement of these troops was delayed by shipping shortages, however. Efforts to reinforce the Marianas and Caroline islands were assigned the highest priority, and the units selected for western New Guinea remained in China until April 1944, when ships became available to transport them.

By early 1944, <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> submarines <a href="Allied%20submarines%20in%20the%20Pacific%20War">were sinking large numbers</a> of Japanese ships. Their activities were frequently guided by '<a href="Ultra">Ultra</a>' <a href="Intelligence%20%28information%20gathering%29">intelligence</a> relating to ship movements which was collected by <a href="Signals%20intelligence">intercepting</a> and <a href="Cryptanalysis">decrypting</a> <a href="Code%20%28cryptography%29">encoded</a> radio transmissions. The IJN routinely broadcast the location and intended route of convoys under its protection, and decrypting these messages allowed Allied naval commanders to alert submarines in the vicinity of convoys. The submarine commanders were free to plan their interception and attack where conditions were most favorable.
The IJN's faulty <a href="Anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine</a> doctrine also contributed to Japan's shipping losses. The Navy had placed a low priority on protecting merchant shipping from submarine attack before and during the early years of the war and convoys were not routinely assembled until 1943. The Grand Escort Headquarters was formed in late 1943 to coordinate convoys and implement a standard doctrine. The Escort-of-Convoy headquarters was also established in April 1944 to provide a pool of senior commanders who were available to command convoys, though none had any experience with convoy operations or anti-submarine warfare.

Attacks on merchant shipping during February 1944 led the Japanese to change the composition of their convoys. During this month, over ten percent of the Japanese merchant marine was sunk by submarines and air attack. These losses included several transport ships carrying reinforcements to the Marianas and Carolines. In response, the Grand Escort Fleet Headquarters increased the average size of Japanese convoys from five ships to "large" convoys of 10-20 vessels. This change allowed the IJN to allocate more escort ships to each convoy and it was hoped that conducting fewer convoys would also reduce the number of targets available to submarines. While Japanese officers attributed a drop in sinkings during March to the changed tactics, this was actually due to the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">U.S. Pacific Fleet</a>'s submarines being diverted to support raids conducted by the <a href="Fast%20Carrier%20Task%20Force">Fast Carrier Task Force</a> that month.

The "Take Ichi" convoy was assembled at Shanghai in April 1944. Its task was to carry the <a href="32nd%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">32nd Division</a> to <a href="Mindanao">Mindanao</a> and the main body of the <a href="35th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">35th Division</a> to western New Guinea. Both divisions had been formed in 1939 and were veterans of fighting in China during the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a>. One of the 35th Division's three infantry <a href="regiment">regiment</a>s was detached from the division in early April and sent to the <a href="Palau">Palau islands</a>, arriving there later that month without loss.

The two divisions embarked on large transport ships protected by an unusually strong escort force. <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Sadamichi%20Kajioka">Sadamichi Kajioka</a>—who was a veteran of several previous operations, including the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wake%20Island">Battle of Wake Island</a>—was appointed to command the convoy. The escort force was the newly established 6th Escort Convoy Command and included Kajioka's flagship, the coal burning <a href="minelayer">minelayer</a> , as well as <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s , and , <a href="frigate">frigate</a> , ocean escort ships ('<a href="kaibokan">kaibokan</a>') "CD-20" and "CD-22", minesweeper "W-2", <a href="subchaser">subchaser</a>s "CH-37" and "CH-38" and <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a>s "Uji", "Ataka" and "Tama Maru No. 7".

The "Take Ichi" convoy sailed from Shanghai bound for <a href="Manila">Manila</a> on 17 April, and initially comprised 15 transports and the 6th Escort Convoy Command. Seven of the transports were traveling to Manila only and the 32nd and 35th Divisions were each carried by four vessels. Allied code breakers decrypted radio signals relating to the convoy's departure and subsequent intercepts allowed <a href="Traffic%20analysis">radio traffic analysts</a> to follow its progress south.

Intelligence from the intercepted radio signals was used to guide the submarine toward the convoy, and she made contact with it off the northwest coast of <a href="Luzon">Luzon</a> on the morning of 26 April. The submarine's captain—<a href="Commander%20%28United%20States%29">Commander</a> Tommy Dykers—attempted to maneuver into a position to attack the convoy but lost contact when he was forced to evade a Japanese submarine. An aircraft sighted and attacked "Jack" a few minutes later, but the convoy did not change course. Dykers regained contact at midday after sighting "Shirataka"'s heavy smoke exhaust and surfaced an hour before sunset to get into an attack position. He was forced to submerge, however, when another aircraft attacked the submarine.

"Jack" surfaced again after dark, and successfully attacked after the moon set. Dykers found that the Japanese escorts were alert, and was unable to penetrate the convoy. As a result, he attacked three times by firing a total of 19 <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es from long range into the mass of ships at the center of the convoy. These attacks sank the 5,425-<a href="Gross%20Register%20Tonnage">ton</a> freighter "<a href="SS%20Yoshida%20Maru%20No.%201">SS Yoshida Maru No. 1</a>", which was carrying an entire regiment of the 32nd Division. All 3,000 soldiers onboard drowned when the ship sank quickly. The remaining Japanese ships continued to Manila, arriving there on 29 April.

The 32nd Division's destination changed during the voyage from Shanghai to Manila. Imperial General Headquarters was concerned that the increasing difficulty of shipping units towards the front line meant that it would not be possible to complete the planned reinforcement of the "absolute zone of national defense" before Allied forces reached the area. As a result, it was decided to use the division to reinforce the <a href="Japanese%20Second%20Army">Second Army</a> in western New Guinea and the eastern <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Netherlands East Indies</a> (NEI)—which were under direct threat of attack—rather than send it to Mindanao.
The "Take Ichi" convoy resumed its journey to New Guinea on 1 May. Its composition was now eight transports (one of the Manila-bound transports having replaced "Yoshida Maru") under the protection of "Shirataka", "Asakaze", "Shiratsuyu", minesweeper "W-22", "CH-37" and "CH-38". The convoy took a special route planned by the Third Southern Expeditionary Fleet to reduce the risk of submarine attack.

U.S. signals intelligence operators again detected the convoy's departure. On 2 May, analysts estimated its size as nine transports and seven escorts carrying 12,784 troops of the 32nd Division and an unknown number of men from the 35th Division. Decoded Japanese Army Water Transport Code messages also provided the Allies with the convoy's route, speed, daily noon positions and destination. This "extraordinary intelligence coup" was passed to the relevant commands on 2 May and the USN positioned submarines to ambush the Japanese ships.

The "Take Ichi" convoy suffered a devastating submarine attack on 6 May. On that day, intercepted the Japanese ships in the <a href="Celebes%20Sea">Celebes Sea</a> near the northeastern tip of <a href="Sulawesi">Celebes</a>. "Gurnard"s captain—Commander Herb Andrews—submerged his boat and made a cautious approach to avoid detection by aircraft. He reached a firing position four hours later and fired six torpedoes at two transports. Only one of these torpedoes struck its mark, and a second salvo missed its intended targets but hit another transport. Andrews then turned his boat and fired further torpedoes from "Gurnard"'s stern <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s which hit a third transport. One of the Japanese destroyers counterattacked "Gurnard" and forced Andrews to break off his attack. The destroyer was traveling at too great a speed for its detection gear to function, however, and did not damage the submarine, despite dropping approximately 100 <a href="depth%20charge">depth charge</a>s.

"Gurnard" rose to <a href="periscope%20depth">periscope depth</a> two hours later and found that a major effort to rescue troops and equipment from the torpedoed transports was under way. That night, the submarine torpedoed one of the crippled transports which was still afloat. "Gurnard"'s attack sank transports "Aden Maru" (5,825 tons) and "Taijima Maru" (6,995 tons) as well as the cargo ship "Tenshinzan Marau" (6,886 tons). While the rescue effort was relatively successful, 1,290 troops were killed and much of their equipment was lost.

Due to its heavy losses, the "Take Ichi" convoy was ordered to dock at Halmahera in the eastern NEI rather than continue to New Guinea. The surviving ships arrived there on 9 May. Both divisions and their equipment were unloaded and the convoy sailed for Manila on 13 May, arriving on 20 May without further loss.

The attacks on the "Take Ichi" convoy blunted the 32nd and 35th Divisions' fighting power. The 32nd Division's combat elements were reduced from nine to five infantry <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s and from four to one and a half <a href="artillery">artillery</a> battalions. Only four of the six 35th Division infantry battalions which sailed in the convoy reached Halmahera and much of the division's artillery was lost.

The destruction of the Take Ichi convoy also forced the Japanese leadership to acknowledge that it was no longer possible to reinforce or defend most of western New Guinea. While the <a href="Japanese%20Second%20Area%20Army">Second Area Army</a>'s commander <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Korechika%20Anami">Korechika Anami</a> requested that the surviving ships attempt to carry the 35th Division to New Guinea, this was rejected by Imperial General Headquarters. The losses inflicted on the convoy also contributed to the Imperial General Headquarters' decision to move the perimeter of the "absolute zone of national defense" back to a line extending from <a href="Sorong%20%28city%29">Sorong</a> to Halmahera. This represented a strategic withdrawal from the perimeter which had been planned in March.

Japanese naval staff officers gathered in Manila in June to analyze the "Take Ichi" convoy. The officers believed that Japan's communication codes were secure and discussed alternative explanations for the convoy's detection. These explanations included the increase in radio signals at the time the convoy sailed being detected by Allied radio traffic analysts, a Japanese officer in Manila accidentally divulging information and Allied spies working on the Manila waterfront radioing messages about the convoy's composition and departure. The meeting concluded that Allied spies were responsible for the convoy's detection, and the Japanese military's codes were not changed.

Some of the surviving elements of the 32nd and 35th divisions later saw action against American forces. The 35th Division was moved forward from Halmahera to Sorong in small ships during May. The regiment which had been sent to the Palaus in April was also successfully transferred to New Guinea. Elements of the 35th Division subsequently fought in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Biak">Battles of Biak</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Sansapor">Sansapor</a>, but most of the division was stationed on the <a href="Vogelkop%20Peninsula">Vogelkop Peninsula</a> where it was isolated from September 1944. The 32nd Division was retained at Halmahera to garrison the island. Much of the division later saw action on the neighboring island of <a href="Morotai">Morotai</a>, where it <a href="Battle%20of%20Morotai">suffered heavy losses</a> while trying to counterattack an Allied force which had established a base there during September and October 1944.

Nikolai Kulikovsky

Nikolai Alexandrovich Kulikovsky (5 November 1881 – 11 August 1958) was the second husband of <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Olga%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia</a>, the sister of <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Tsar Nicholas II</a> and daughter of <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Russia">Tsar Alexander III</a>.

He was born into a military landowning family from the south of the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, and followed the family tradition by entering the army. In 1903, he was noticed by Grand Duchess Olga during a military review, and they became close friends. Olga wanted to divorce her first husband, <a href="Duke%20Peter%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Oldenburg">Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg</a>, and marry Kulikovsky, but neither her husband nor her brother, the Tsar, would allow it.

During World War I, Olga eventually obtained a divorce and married Kulikovsky. They had two sons. Her brother was deposed in the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>, and Kulikovsky was dismissed from the army by the revolutionary government. The Kulikovskys were forced into exile, and he became a farmer and businessman in Denmark, where they lived until after World War II. In 1948, they emigrated to Canada as agricultural immigrants, but within four years of their arrival they had sold their farm and moved into a small suburban house. He became increasingly disabled by back pain, and died in 1958 aged 76.

Nikolai Kulikovsky was born into a military family from the <a href="Voronezh%20Oblast">Voronezh province</a> of Russia. His grandfather was a general during the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, and his family owned two large estates in <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. He rode from an early age, became an expert horseman, and was educated at Petrograd Real College of Gurevich, followed by the Nikolai Cavalry College, from where he graduated with a degree.

He joined the Blue <a href="Cuirassier">Cuirassier</a> regiment of the <a href="imperial%20Russia">imperial Russia</a>n cavalry shortly before 1903. <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Michael%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Michael</a>, the younger brother of <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Tsar Nicholas II</a>, was the regiment's honorary colonel. In April 1903, during a military parade at the <a href="Pavlovsk%20Palace">Pavlovsk Palace</a>, Grand Duchess Olga, the youngest sister of Nicholas and Michael, saw Kulikovsky and begged Michael to arrange the seating at a casual luncheon so that she and Kulikovsky were adjacent. The Grand Duchess was already married to <a href="Duke%20Peter%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Oldenburg">Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg</a>, who was covertly believed by his friends and family to be homosexual. A few days after her brief meeting with Kulikovsky, Olga asked Oldenburg for a divorce, which he refused with the qualification that he would reconsider his decision after seven years.

Kulikovsky was appointed as captain in the Blue Cuirassiers and posted to the provinces. By 1906, he and Olga were corresponding regularly, when Olga's husband Duke Peter appointed Kulikovsky as his <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a>. With Peter's permission, Kulikovsky moved into the 200-room residence in Sergievskaya Street, <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>, that Peter shared with Olga. According to a fellow officer, gossip about a possible romance between Kulikovsky and the Grand Duchess, based on little more than their holding hands in public, spread through high society.

Though Olga repeatedly asked <a href="Tsar%20Nicholas%20II">Tsar Nicholas II</a> to allow her to divorce, her brother refused on religious and dynastic grounds; he believed marriage was for life and that royalty should marry within royalty. When their brother, Grand Duke Michael, eloped with his mistress, <a href="Natalia%20Brassova">Natasha Wulfert</a>, the Tsar and Olga were scandalized along with the rest of society. Natasha was a commoner who had been divorced twice, and one of her former husbands was an officer in the same regiment as Kulikovsky. Michael was banished from Russia, and the likelihood of the Tsar ever granting Olga's divorce, or permitting her to marry a commoner, looked remote.

At the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Kulikovsky was sent to the front with his regiment. Michael was recalled from abroad, and Olga went to work in a military hospital as a nurse. Olga continued to press the Tsar to allow her divorce. In a letter she wrote, "...finish with the divorce now during the war while all eyes and minds are occupied elsewhere—and such a small thing would be lost in all the greater things". The war went badly for the Russian imperial forces, and the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a>, led by Germany, advanced into Russia. Fearful for Kulikovsky's safety, Olga pleaded with the Tsar to transfer him to the relative safety of <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>, where she was stationed at a hospital. In 1916, after visiting her in Kiev, the Tsar officially annulled her marriage to Duke Peter, and she married Kulikovsky on 16 November 1916, in the Kievo-Vasilievskaya Church on Triokhsviatitelskaya (Three Saints Street) in Kiev. Only the officiating priest, Olga's mother the <a href="Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%29">Dowager Empress Marie</a>, Olga's brother-in-law <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Alexander%20Mikhailovich%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Alexander</a>, two fellow nurses from the hospital in Kiev and four officers of the Akhtyrsky regiment, of which Olga was honorary colonel, attended. Their two-week honeymoon was spent in a farmhouse in Podgorny that had belonged to family friends of the Kulikovskys. After visiting Kulikovsky's parents and grandmother in <a href="Kharkov">Kharkov</a>, Olga and Kulikovsky returned to Kiev.

During the war, internal tensions and economic deprivation in Russia continued to mount and revolutionary sympathies grew. After Nicholas II was deposed in early 1917, many members of the Romanov dynasty, including Nicholas and his immediate family, were held under house arrest. The new government retired Kulikovsky from the army with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Dowager Empress Marie, Grand Duke Alexander, Grand Duchess Olga, and Kulikovsky managed to escape to the <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a> where they lived for a time before they too were placed under house arrest at one of the imperial estates. As a commoner, Kulikovsky was permitted more freedom of movement than the Romanovs, and was occasionally able to leave the estate in a pony-cart, which allowed him to run errands, obtain food, and seek news of the outside. On 12 August 1917, Olga and Kulikovsky's first child and son, Tikhon, was born in the Crimea. He was named after one of the Grand Duchess's favorite saints, <a href="Tikhon%20of%20Zadonsk">Tikhon of Zadonsk</a>. Although the grandson of an emperor and the nephew of another, Tikhon received no titles because his father was a commoner.

As newspapers were banned and letters infrequent, the Romanovs under house arrest knew little of the fate of Tsar Nicholas and his family. Nicholas, <a href="Alexandra%20Feodorovna%20%28Alix%20of%20Hesse%29">his wife</a>, and their children, were originally held at their official residence, the <a href="Alexander%20Palace">Alexander Palace</a> at <a href="Tsarskoye%20Selo">Tsarskoye Selo</a>, but the provisional government under <a href="Alexander%20Kerensky">Alexander Kerensky</a> relocated them to <a href="Tobolsk">Tobolsk</a>, <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>. Eventually, in July 1918, after being transferred to <a href="Yekaterinburg">Yekaterinburg</a>, Nicholas and his family were killed by their <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> guards. In the Crimea, the Grand Duchess's family were condemned to death by the <a href="Yalta">Yalta</a> revolutionary council but the executions were stayed by the <a href="Sevastopol">Sevastopol</a> council, who refused to act without orders from Moscow. In March 1918, German forces advanced on the Crimea, and the revolutionary guards were replaced by German ones.

When Germany surrendered to the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allies of World War I</a> in November 1918, the German troops evacuated, allowing the surviving members of the imperial family time to escape abroad. The British warship <a href="HMS%20Marlborough%20%281912%29">HMS "Marlborough"</a> rescued the Dowager Empress Marie and some of her family from the Crimea but Grand Duchess Olga and Kulikovsky decided to stay in Russia and travelled to the Caucasus region, where the Bolsheviks had been pushed back by the <a href="White%20Army">White Army</a>. During the journey, a coupling on the train carriage in which they were travelling developed a fault, possibly from sabotage, and Kulikovsky crawled over the carriage roofs to reach the driver and stop the train. In the Caucasus, Kulikovsky took a job working on a farm as he was unable to secure a military posting in the White Army because the commanding general, <a href="Anton%20Denikin">Anton Denikin</a>, wished to avoid association with the Romanovs. In a rented farmhouse at the large <a href="Cossack">Cossack</a> village of Novominskaya Olga and Kulikovsky's second son, Guri, was born on 23 April 1919. He was named after Guri Panaev, who had been killed serving in Olga's Akhtyrsky regiment. As the White Army was pushed back and the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> approached, the family set out on what would be their last journey through Russia; they travelled to <a href="Rostov-on-Don">Rostov-on-Don</a>, and from there took refuge at <a href="Novorossiysk">Novorossiysk</a> in the residence of the Danish consul, Thomas Schytte, who informed them of Dowager Empress Marie's safe arrival in <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>.

After a brief stay with the Danish consul, the family were shipped to a refugee camp on the island of <a href="B%C3%BCy%C3%BCkada">Büyükada</a> in the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> Strait near <a href="Istanbul%2C%20Turkey">Istanbul, Turkey</a>, where the Kulikovsky family shared three rooms with eleven other adults. After two weeks, they were evacuated to <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a> in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a>. The Yugoslav Regent Alexander Karageorgevich, later to become King <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Yugoslavia">Alexander I</a>, offered them a permanent home there, but Dowager Empress Marie summoned her daughter to Denmark. The Grand Duchess complied, and the family arrived in Copenhagen on Good Friday 1920. They lived with Kulikovsky's mother-in-law, Dowager Empress Marie, at first at the <a href="Amalienborg%20Palace">Amalienborg Palace</a> and then at the royal estate of <a href="Hvid%C3%B8re%20%28building%29">Hvidøre</a>. Kulikovsky and Marie did not get along; he was resentful of his wife acting as Marie's secretary and companion, and Marie was distant toward him.

Without a role or rank, Kulikovsky brooded in Denmark, becoming moody and listless. A spinal injury sustained during the war, for which he had to wear a corset, remained unhealed. In 1925, Kulikovsky accompanied his wife to a Berlin nursing home to meet <a href="Anna%20Anderson">Anna Anderson</a>, who claimed to be Olga's niece, <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Anastasia%20Nikolaevna%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia</a>. According to <a href="Harriet%20von%20Rathlef">Harriet von Rathlef</a>, who witnessed the meeting, while Olga and Anderson conversed, he sat in a corner and sulked. Although Olga felt sympathy for Anderson, if only because she was ill, she eventually denounced her as an impostor. Possibly, she was pressured to do so by Kulikovsky and Dowager Empress Marie.

Marie died on 13 October 1928, and the Kulikovskys moved out of Hvidøre. After a brief stay in the Amalienborg Palace, the Kulikovskys moved to <a href="Holte">Holte</a>, near <a href="Klampenborg">Klampenborg</a>, where a Danish millionaire, Gorm Rasmussen, engaged Kulikovsky to manage his stables. Hvidøre and some of Marie's jewellery were sold. With Olga's inheritance, Kulikovsky and his family were able to purchase "Knudsminde" Farm, several miles outside of <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>. Kulikovsky was appointed to the board of a Russian insurance company based in Copenhagen, and oversaw the running of the farm. The farm-estate became a center for the Russian monarchist and anti-Bolshevik community in Denmark.

On 2 February 1935, he and Olga attended and acted as godparents, to the baptizing of Aleksander Schalburg, the son of <a href="Christian%20Frederik%20von%20Schalburg">Christian Frederik von Schalburg</a>.

On 9 April 1940, neutral Denmark was invaded by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and was occupied for the rest of World War II. As Olga's sons, Tikhon and Guri, served as officers in the <a href="Danish%20Army">Danish Army</a>, they were interned as prisoners of war, but their imprisonment in a Copenhagen hotel lasted less than two months. Other Russian émigrés, keen to fight against the Soviets, enlisted in the German forces. Despite her sons' internment and her mother's Danish origins, Olga was implicated in her compatriots' collusion with German forces, as she continued to meet and extend help to Russian émigrés fighting against communism. After the surrender of Germany in 1945, the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> wrote to the Danish government accusing the Grand Duchess of conspiracy against the Soviet authorities. With the end of the war, Soviet troops <a href="Bornholm%23Soviet%20Occupation%201945%E2%80%931946">occupied the easternmost part of Denmark</a>, and Olga grew fearful of an assassination or kidnap attempt. She decided to move her family across the Atlantic to the relative safety of rural Canada, a decision with which Kulikovsky complied.

In May 1948, the Kulikovskys travelled to London by Danish troopship. They were housed in a <a href="grace-and-favour">grace-and-favour</a> apartment at <a href="Hampton%20Court%20Palace">Hampton Court Palace</a> while arrangements were made for their journey to Canada as agricultural immigrants. On 2 June 1948, Kulikovsky, Olga, Tikhon and his Danish-born wife Agnete, Guri and his Danish-born wife Ruth, Guri and Ruth's two children, Xenia and Leonid, and Olga's companion and former maid Emilia Tenso ("Mimka") departed <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> on board the "<a href="RMS%20Empress%20of%20Canada%20%281928%29">Empress of Canada</a>". After a rough crossing, the ship docked at <a href="City%20of%20Halifax">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>. The family proceeded to <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, where they lived until they purchased a 200-acre (0.8 km) farm in <a href="Halton%20County%2C%20Ontario">Halton County, Ontario</a>, near <a href="Campbellville%2C%20Ontario">Campbellville</a>. Kulikovsky was relieved to move out of Toronto, and escape media attention.

By 1952, the farm had become a burden to the elderly couple. Their sons had moved away; labour was hard to come by; Kulikovsky suffered increasing back pain and disability, and some of Olga's remaining jewellery was stolen. The farm was sold, and Kulikovsky, Olga, and Mimka, moved to a smaller 5-room house at 2130 Camilla Road, <a href="Cooksville%2C%20Ontario">Cooksville, Ontario</a>, a suburb of Toronto (now amalgamated into the city of <a href="Mississauga">Mississauga</a>). Mimka suffered a stroke that left her an invalid, and Olga nursed her until Mimka's death in 1954. Neighbours and visitors to the region, including foreign and royal dignitaries, took interest in Olga as the "last Romanov", and visited their small home, which was also a magnet for <a href="Romanov%20impostors">Romanov impostors</a> whom both Kulikovsky and Olga considered a menace. Welcome visitors included <a href="Princess%20Marina%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Kent">Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent</a>, the daughter of her first cousin <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Elena%20Vladimirovna%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia</a>, in 1954.

By 1952, Kulikovsky had shrunk more than 4 inches (10 cm) from his peak height of 6 ft 2 inches (188 cm). He distrusted conventional medicine and tried homeopathy instead. By 1958, he was virtually paralyzed, and had difficulty sleeping. At the end of his life he was sleeping on the sofa in the living room of the couple's Cooksville house, to avoid waking his wife. He died there on the night of 11 August 1958. His estate was valued at 12,123.47 Canadian dollars, about 98,000 Canadian dollars as of 2012. The Grand Duchess died two years later, and was interred next to her husband in <a href="York%20Cemetery%2C%20Toronto">York Cemetery, Toronto</a>.

Verpa bohemica

Verpa bohemica is a species of <a href="fungus">fungus</a> in the family <a href="Morchellaceae">Morchellaceae</a>. Commonly known as the early morel (or early false morel) or the wrinkled thimble-cap, it is one of several species known informally as a "<a href="false%20morel">false morel</a>". The <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a> has a pale yellow or brown thimble-shaped <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a>— in diameter by long—that has a surface wrinkled and ribbed with brain-like convolutions. The cap hangs from the top of a lighter-colored, brittle <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> that measures up to long by thick. Microscopically, the mushroom is distinguished by its large <a href="spore">spore</a>s, typically 60–80 by 15–18 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>, and the presence of only two spores per <a href="ascus">ascus</a>.

In the field, the mushroom is reliably distinguished from the <a href="morel">true morel</a>s on the basis of cap attachment: "V. bohemica" has a cap that hangs completely free from the stem. Although widely considered <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>, consumption of the mushroom is generally not advised due to reports of <a href="mushroom%20poisoning">poisoning</a> in susceptible individuals. Poisoning symptoms include <a href="wikt%3Agastrointestinal">gastrointestinal</a> upset and lack of muscular coordination. "V. bohemica" is found in northern North America, Europe, and Asia. It fruits in early spring, growing on the ground in woods following the snowmelt, before the appearance of "true morels" (genus "<a href="Morchella">Morchella</a>"). The <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonym</a> "Ptychoverpa bohemica" is often used by European mycologists.

The species was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> in the scientific literature by the Czech physician and mycologist <a href="Julius%20Vincenz%20von%20Krombholz">Julius Vincenz von Krombholz</a> in 1828, under the name "Morchella bohemica". The German naturalist <a href="Joseph%20Schr%C3%B6ter">Joseph Schröter</a> transferred it to the genus "<a href="Verpa">Verpa</a>" in 1893. "Ptychoverpa bohemica" is a <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> that was published by Frenchman <a href="Jean%20Louis%20%C3%89mile%20Boudier">Jean Louis Émile Boudier</a> in his 1907 treatise on the <a href="Discomycetes">Discomycetes</a> of Europe; the name is still occasionally used, especially in European publications. Boudier believed that the large, curved <a href="ascospore">ascospore</a>s and the rare and short <a href="paraphyses">paraphyses</a> were sufficiently distinct to warrant a new genus to contain the single species. "Ptychoverpa" has also been <a href="biological%20classification">classified</a> as a <a href="section%20%28botany%29">section</a> of "Verpa". The section is characterized by the presence of thick longitudinal ridges on the cap that can be simple or forked. The species was first discovered in Canada by Alfred Brooker Klugh shortly before 1910 where it was referred to by another synonym, Morchella bispora.

The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "bohemica" refers to <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a> (now a part of the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>), where Krombholz originally collected the species. The mushroom is <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the "early morel", "early false morel", or the "wrinkled thimble-cap". "Ptychoverpa" is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "ptyx" (<a href="genitive%20case">genitive</a> form "ptychos"), meaning "fold", layer", or "plate".

The <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> of this fungus (known technically as an <a href="apothecium">apothecium</a>) is in diameter by long, with a conical or bell shape. It is folded into longitudinal ridges that often fuse together ("<a href="anastomose">anastomose</a>") in a vein-like network. The cap is attached to the stem at the top only—hanging from the top of the <a href="Stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>, with the lobed edge free from the stem—and varies in color from yellowish brown to reddish brown; the underside of the cap is pale. The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> is long by thick, cream-white in color, and tapers upward so that the stem is thicker at the base than at the top. Although the stem is initially loosely stuffed with cottony <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e, it eventually becomes hollow in maturity; overall, the mushroom is rather fragile. The <a href="spore%20print">spore deposit</a> is yellow, and the <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is white.

Relative to other typical mushroom species, the <a href="spores">spores</a> of "V. bohemica" are huge, typically measuring 60–80 by 15–18 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>. They are elliptical, smooth, sometimes curved, and appear <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent) to yellowish. The spores, which number two (more rarely three) per <a href="ascus">ascus</a> are characteristic for this species. The smooth, elliptical asci measure 275–350 µm long by 16–23 µm wide. The British-Canadian mycologist <a href="Arthur%20Henry%20Reginald%20Buller">Arthur Henry Reginald Buller</a> determined that the asci are <a href="heliotropic">heliotropic</a>—they bend toward light. As he noted, "I cut transverse sections though their pilei, examined these sections under the microscope, and at once perceived that in all the hymenial grooves and depressions the asci were curved outwards so that their opercula must have faced the strongest rays of light to which the ends of the asci has been subjected in the places where the fruit-bodies developed." This response to the stimulus of light is significant because it permits a fruit body to point and later discharge its asci towards open spaces, thus increasing the chances that the spores will be dispersed by wind. The <a href="paraphyses">paraphyses</a> are thick and club-shaped, with diameters of 7–8 µm at their tips.

The <a href="edible%20mushroom">edibility</a> of this species is questionable; although "Verpa bohemica" is eaten by many, consumption of large amounts in a single sitting, or on successive days, has been reported to cause poisoning in susceptible individuals. Symptoms include gastrointestinal upset and lack of muscular coordination, similar to the effects reported by some individuals after consuming the false morel species "<a href="Gyromitra%20esculenta">Gyromitra esculenta</a>". The responsible toxin in "G. esculenta" is <a href="gyromitrin">gyromitrin</a>; it was suspected that "V. bohemica" may be able to synthesize low levels of the toxin, however, no experiments on "V. bohemica" have concluded that it contains any level of gyromitrin. Over-consumption of the mushroom has been reported to have induced a coma. Those who do wish to eat this species are often advised to <a href="parboil">parboil</a> with copious quantities of water (discarding the water before consumption), to dry the specimens before eating, or, if eating for the first time, to restrict consumption to small portions to test their tolerance. Some advocate only eating the caps and discarding the stems. Opinions on the flavor of the mushrooms vary, ranging from "strong but not on a par with true morels", to "pleasant", to "not distinctive".

The closely related species "<a href="Verpa%20conica">Verpa conica</a>" typically has a smooth cap, although specimens with wrinkled caps are known. "V. conica" may be distinguished microscopically by its eight-spored asci. Its North American range extends much further south than "V. bohemica". Another similar group of species are the "half-free" morels, "<a href="Morchella%20semilibera">Morchella semilibera</a>" and others, which have a honeycombed cap that is attached to the stalk for about half of its length, and with ridges that are darker than the pits. Additionally, a cross-sectioned stem of a specimen of "M. semilibera" is hollow, while "V. bohemica" usually has cottony wisps in the stem, and "M. semilibera" usually has vertical perforations near the base, while "V. bohemica" lacks them. "Verpa bohemica" may be reliably distinguished from all similar species by its much larger spores.

The fruit bodies of "V. bohemica" grow singly or scattered on the ground in woods in early spring, often before the appearance of the <a href="morel">morel</a>, and throughout the morel season. It is often found along riverbanks, near <a href="Populus%20sect.%20Aegiros">cottonwood</a>s, <a href="willow">willow</a>s and <a href="aspen">aspen</a>s, often buried in plant litter. The fungus prefers to fruit in moist areas with ample sunlight. Its minimum growth temperature is , with an optimum of , and a maximum of about . A study of <a href="carbon%2013">carbon</a> and <a href="nitrogen%2015">nitrogen</a> <a href="isotope%20analysis">isotope ratios</a> indicated that "Verpa bohemica" is <a href="saprobic">saprobic</a>, that is, obtaining nutrients from decomposing <a href="organic%20matter">organic matter</a>. It has been suggested, however, that the fungus is <a href="mycorrhizal">mycorrhizal</a> for at least part of its <a href="biological%20life%20cycle">life cycle</a>. The fungus has a wide distribution throughout northern North America; its range extends south to the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> in the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwestern United States</a>, and south to northern <a href="California">California</a> on the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a>. In Europe, the fungus is widely distributed, and has been collected from Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the Ukraine. In Asia, it has been recorded from India and Turkey.

A 10-year study of the distribution, time of fruiting and habitats of morel and false morel population in <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a> showed that early false morels are the first morels to fruit in the spring, appearing shortly after leaves begin to form on <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> trees. Narrow-head morels ("<a href="Morchella%20angusticeps">Morchella angusticeps</a>") fruit next, followed by the yellow or white morels ("<a href="Morchella%20esculenta">Morchella esculenta</a>"), then lastly "<a href="Morchella%20crassipes">Morchella crassipes</a>". The fruit bodies serve as a habitat for breeding <a href="dipteran">dipteran</a>s (flies), including "<a href="Porricondyla%20media">Porricondyla media</a>", "<a href="Pegomya%20geniculata">Pegomya geniculata</a>", and "<a href="Trichocera%20annulata">Trichocera annulata</a>".

Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)

<a href="Air%20Vice%20Marshal">Air Vice Marshal</a> Adrian Lindley Trevor Cole, <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a>, <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">DSO</a>, <a href="Military%20Cross">MC</a>, <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">DFC</a> (19 June 1895 – 14 February 1966) was a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). Joining the <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">army</a> at the outbreak of World War I, he transferred to the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> in 1916 and flew with <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron</a> in the <a href="Middle%20Eastern%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20I">Middle East</a> and <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadron</a> on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. He became an <a href="Flying%20ace">ace</a>, credited with victories over ten enemy aircraft, and earned the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> and the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a>. In 1921, he was a founding member of the RAAF.

"King" Cole rose to the position of Air Member for Supply in 1933 and gained promotion to <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> in 1935. The following year he was appointed the first commanding officer of <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">Headquarters RAAF Station Richmond</a>. During World War II, he led <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western Area Command</a> in <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Northern Territory, and held a series of overseas posts in North Africa, England, Northern Ireland, and Ceylon. As Forward Air Controller during the <a href="Dieppe%20Raid">Dieppe Raid</a> in 1942, he was wounded in action and awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>. Cole served on corporate <a href="boards%20of%20directors">boards of directors</a> following his retirement from the RAAF in 1946. He died in 1966 at the age of seventy.

Adrian Cole was born in <a href="Glen%20Iris%2C%20Victoria">Glen Iris</a>, a suburb of <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, to <a href="barrister">barrister</a> and doctor Robert Cole and his wife Helen (née Hake). He was educated at <a href="Geelong%20Grammar%20School">Geelong Grammar School</a> and <a href="Melbourne%20Grammar%20School">Melbourne Grammar School</a>, where he was a member of the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Cadets">cadet corps</a>. When World War I broke out in August 1914, Cole gained a <a href="Commissioned%20officer">commission</a> in the <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">Australian Military Forces</a>, serving with the 55th (Collingwood) Infantry Regiment. He resigned his commission to join the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> on 28 January 1916, intending to become a pilot in the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a>.

Posted to <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron</a> (also known until 1918 as No. 67 Squadron, <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a>), Cole departed Melbourne aboard HMAT A67 "Orsova" on 16 March 1916, bound for Egypt. He was commissioned a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in June and began his pilot training in August. By the beginning of 1917, he was flying reconnaissance and <a href="Scout%20%28aircraft%29">scouting</a> missions in <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">Sinai and Palestine</a>. He took part in an early example of Allied air-sea cooperation on 25 February, directing French naval fire against the coastal town of <a href="Jaffa">Jaffa</a> by radio from his <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20B.E.2">B.E.2 biplane</a>. On 20 April, Cole and fellow squadron member Lieutenant <a href="Peter%20Roy%20Maxwell%20Drummond">Roy Maxwell Drummond</a> attacked six enemy aircraft that were threatening to bomb Allied cavalry, scattering their formation and chasing them back to their own lines. Both airmen were awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> for their actions; Cole's citation was published in a supplement to the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 16 August 1917:

The day after the action that earned him the Military Cross, Cole was flying a <a href="Martinsyde%20G.100">Martinsyde G.100 "Elephant"</a> over Tel el Sheria when he was hit by ground fire and forced to crash land behind enemy lines; after setting his aircraft alight he was picked up and rescued by Captain <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a>. On 26 June, following an eight-plane raid on Turkish Fourth Army headquarters in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, Cole and another pilot suffered engine seizures while undertaking a similar rescue of a downed comrade; all three airmen were forced to walk through <a href="no%20man%27s%20land">no man's land</a> before being picked up by an <a href="Australian%20Light%20Horse">Australian Light Horse</a> patrol.

Promoted to captain in August 1917, Cole was posted to France as a <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight commander</a> with <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadron AFC</a> (also known until 1918 as No. 68 Squadron RFC). Flying <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20S.E.5">S.E.5</a> <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a> on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, he was credited with destroying or sending out of control ten enemy aircraft between July and October 1918, making him an <a href="Flying%20ace">ace</a>. In a single <a href="sortie">sortie</a> over the <a href="Leie%20River">Lys Valley</a> on 19 August, Cole shot down two German fighters and narrowly avoided being shot down himself immediately afterwards, when he was attacked by five <a href="Fokker%20Dr.I">Fokker Triplane</a>s that were being pursued by Allied <a href="Bristol%20F.2%20Fighter">Bristol Fighters</a>. On 24 September, he led into battle a patrol of fifteen S.E.5s that destroyed or damaged eight German fighters over <a href="Haubourdin">Haubourdin</a> and <a href="P%C3%A9renchies">Pérenchies</a>, claiming one <a href="Pfalz%20D.III">Pfalz D.III</a> for himself.

Cole was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> for his actions on 7 October 1918, when he led No. 2 Squadron through "a tornado of anti-aircraft fire" in a major assault on transport infrastructure in <a href="Lille">Lille</a>. During the raid he successfully bombed a goods engine and a troop train, and put several anti-aircraft batteries out of action, before leading his formation back to base at low level. The announcement and accompanying citation for his decoration was <a href="London%20Gazette">gazetted</a> on 8 February 1919:

Returning to Australia in February 1919, Cole briefly spent time as a civilian before accepting a commission in the <a href="Australian%20Air%20Corps">Australian Air Corps</a>, the short-lived successor to the Australian Flying Corps, in January 1920. On 17 June, accompanied by Captain <a href="Hippolyte%20De%20La%20Rue">Hippolyte De La Rue</a>, he flew a <a href="Airco%20DH.9">DH.9</a> to a height of , setting an Australian altitude record that stood for more than ten years. He transferred to the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> as a <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> in March 1921, becoming one of its original twenty-one officers. On 30 November, he married his cousin Katherine Cole in St Peter's Chapel at Melbourne Grammar School; the couple would have two sons and two daughters. <a href="Squadron%20Leader">Squadron Leader</a> Cole was posted to England in 1923–24 to attend <a href="RAF%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">RAF Staff College, Andover</a>, returning to Australia in 1925 to become Director of Personnel and Training. Promoted to <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a>, he was in charge of <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Flying Training School</a> (No. 1 FTS) at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">RAAF Station Point Cook</a>, Victoria, from 1926 to 1929. The first Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' course took place during Cole's tenure at No. 1 FTS; although twenty-four accidents occurred, injuries were minor, leading him to remark at the graduation ceremony that the students were either made of <a href="Natural%20rubber">India rubber</a> or had learned how to crash "moderately safely".

Cole held command of <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Station Laverton</a> from 1929 until his appointment as Air Member for Supply (AMS) in January 1933. The AMS occupied a seat on the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Air Board</a>, which was chaired by the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> and was collectively responsible for control and administration of the RAAF. In March 1932, Cole accepted an invitation from the <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20Melbourne">Lord Mayor of Melbourne</a> to serve as Deputy Chairman of the 1934 <a href="MacRobertson%20Air%20Race">MacRobertson Air Race</a> from England to Australia, to celebrate <a href="1934%20Centenary%20of%20Melbourne">Melbourne's Centenary</a>. Provision of the RAAF's radio facilities and technicians was considered a boon for contestants, though Cole later recorded that his role involved "twenty months' hard work, without pay ... with loads of scurrilous and other criticism". Promoted to <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> in January 1935, he became the inaugural <a href="commanding%20officer">commanding officer</a> (CO) of <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">Headquarters RAAF Station Richmond</a>, New South Wales, on 20 April 1936. The new headquarters, which had been formed from elements of two of the base's lodger units, <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a> and <a href="No.%202%20Aircraft%20Depot%20RAAF">No. 2 Aircraft Depot</a>, supplanted an earlier arrangement where the CO of No. 3 Squadron had doubled as the station commander. Cole was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20British%20Monarch">Coronation Honours</a> of 11 May 1937, and attended the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College</a> in London the following year. He returned to RAAF Station Laverton as CO in February 1939, taking over from Group Captain <a href="Henry%20Wrigley">Henry Wrigley</a>.
As part of the RAAF's reorganisation following the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, No. 2 Group was formed in Sydney on 20 November, with Cole in command. The group controlled Air Force units in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. Cole was raised to temporary <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a> in December, and took charge of <a href="Central%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Central Area Command</a>, which supplanted No. 2 Group, when it was established in the new year. In September 1941, he was sent to <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North Africa</a> as <a href="Officer%20Commanding">Officer Commanding</a> No. 235 Wing RAF of the <a href="Desert%20Air%20Force">Desert Air Force</a>, where he helped establish a new <a href="anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine warfare</a> unit, <a href="No.%20459%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 459 Squadron RAAF</a>. Posted to England with <a href="No.%2011%20Group%20RAF">Headquarters No. 11 Group</a> in May 1942, he served as Forward Air Controller of the <a href="Dieppe%20Raid">Dieppe Raid</a> on 19 August, responsible for co-ordinating Allied air cover off the French coast aboard <a href="HMS%20Calpe%20%28L71%29">HMS "Calpe"</a>. In doing so, he was seriously wounded in the jaw and upper body when German fighters strafed the ship; he required plastic surgery and spent several weeks recuperating. His gallantry during the action earned him the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>, the announcement being published in a supplement to the "London Gazette" on 2 October 1942. The same month, he was made <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) RAF Northern Ireland, with the acting rank of <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a>, though the command was described in the <a href="Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201939%E2%80%931945">official history of Australia in the war</a> as a "backwater".
In May 1943, Cole returned to Australia, taking over as AOC <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western Area Command</a> from Air Commodore <a href="Frank%20Bladin">Frank Bladin</a> in July. Based in <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Northern Territory, he was responsible for regional air defence, reconnaissance, protection of Allied shipping and, later, offensive operations in the <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>. Cole found the command in "good shape" but considered its air defence capability inadequate, recommending augmentation by long-range fighters such as the <a href="P-38%20Lightning">P-38 Lightning</a>. He nevertheless had to make do with the three squadrons of <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfires</a> already on his strength, and the possibility of calling on the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">USAAF's</a> <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a> for reinforcements as necessary. During August and September, he reduced regular reconnaissance missions to "increase bombing activity to the limit", following a request from General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> to provide all available support for Allied assaults on <a href="Landing%20at%20Lae">Lae</a>–<a href="Landing%20at%20Nadzab">Nadzab</a>. North-Western Area <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberators</a>, <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Hudsons</a>, <a href="Bristol%20Beaufighter">Beaufighters</a> and <a href="Consolidated%20PBY%20Catalina">Catalinas</a> carried out raids to destroy Japanese bases and aircraft, and divert enemy forces from Allied columns. Through March and April 1944, Cole had thirteen squadrons under his control, and was supporting <a href="amphibious%20warfare">amphibious operations</a> against <a href="Operations%20Reckless%20and%20Persecution">Hollandia and Aitape</a>. In May, he directed bombing from North-Western Area on <a href="Surabaya">Surabaya</a> as part of <a href="Operation%20Transom">Operation Transom</a>.

Cole handed over North-Western Area to Air Commodore <a href="Alan%20Charlesworth">Alan Charlesworth</a> in September 1944. He took up an appointment as <a href="Air%20Member%20for%20Personnel%20%28Australia%29">Air Member for Personnel</a> (AMP) in October, but was removed soon afterwards following an incident at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, received an anonymous letter alleging that Cole had become drunk and lost control at a mess meeting on 8 November. Investigating the matter, Jones was unable to establish whether or not Cole had been drunk but was satisfied that he had not behaved appropriately, and issued him a warning without charging or otherwise disciplining him. Under pressure from the Federal government, Jones dismissed Cole from the position of AMP and posted him to Ceylon in January 1945 as RAAF Liaison Officer to <a href="South%20East%20Asia%20Command">South East Asia Command</a>. Cole served in this role until the end of the war, taking part in negotiations for the Japanese capitulation and acting as Australia's senior representative at the formal surrender ceremony in Singapore on 12 September 1945.

Cole was summarily retired from the RAAF in 1946, along with several other senior commanders and veterans of World War I, primarily to make way for the advancement of younger and equally capable officers. In an earlier minute to the Minister for Air, <a href="Arthur%20Drakeford">Arthur Drakeford</a>, regarding post-war command prospects, Air Vice Marshal Jones had assessed Cole as having failed to display "certain of those qualities expected to be possessed by senior officers of such rank". In any case, his role overseas was redundant. Cole, for his part, later wrote to the Melbourne "<a href="The%20Herald%20%28Melbourne%29">Herald</a>" that he considered the RAAF's administration during World War II to be "weak", and that as a consequence he felt "a lot happier to serve most of the War with the Royal Air Force".

Ranked substantive air commodore and honorary air vice marshal, Cole was officially discharged from the RAAF on 17 April 1946. He resented being forcibly retired, and stood for election as the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal Party</a> candidate for Drakeford's seat, the Victorian <a href="Division%20of%20Maribyrnong">Division of Maribyrnong</a>, in the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201946">federal election</a> that year. Cole stated that his candidacy was "an endeavour to bring some sense and stability to Government administration" but was unsuccessful, and Drakeford retained the seat. Cole subsequently served as a <a href="company%20director">director</a> with Pacific Insurance and <a href="Airlines%20of%20South%20Australia">Guinea Airways</a>. He died in Melbourne of chronic <a href="respiratory%20disease">respiratory disease</a> on 14 February 1966. Survived by his wife and four children, he was buried in Camperdown Cemetery, Victoria, following a funeral at RAAF Base Laverton.

Cole Street and the Cole Street Conservation Precinct at Point Cook Base, <a href="RAAF%20Williams">RAAF Williams</a>, are named for Adrian Cole. His decorations were held by the Naval and Military Club, Melbourne, where he had been a long-standing member. In July 2009, following the club's dissolution, the medals were to be auctioned along with other memorabilia. This action was challenged by Cole's family, who argued that his decorations were only on loan to the club, and should be donated to the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> (AWM). As the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Victoria">Supreme Court of Victoria</a> deliberated on the case, the parties involved negotiated a settlement whereby Cole's medals would be transferred to the AWM.

Fragment of a Crucifixion

Fragment of a Crucifixion is an unfinished 1950 painting by the Irish-born <a href="Figurative%20art">figurative</a> painter <a href="Francis%20Bacon%20%28artist%29">Francis Bacon</a>. It shows two animals engaged in an existential struggle; the upper figure, which may be a dog or a cat, crouches over a <a href="chimera%20%28mythology%29">chimera</a> and is at the <a href="Predation">point of kill</a>. It stoops on the horizontal beam of a T-shaped structure, which may signify <a href="Christian%20cross">Christ's cross</a>. The painting contains thinly sketched passer-by figures, who appear as if oblivious to the central drama.

Typical of Bacon's work, the painting is drawn from a wide variety of sources, including the screaming mouth of the nurse in <a href="Sergei%20Eisenstein">Sergei Eisenstein</a>'s 1925 film "<a href="Battleship%20Potemkin">Battleship Potemkin</a>" and <a href="iconography">iconography</a> from both the <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">Crucifixion of Jesus</a> and the <a href="descent%20from%20the%20cross">descent from the cross</a>. The chimera's despair forms the centrepiece of the work; its agony can be compared to Bacon's later works focusing on the <a href="Motif%20%28visual%20arts%29">motif</a> of an open mouth.

Although the title has religious connotations, Bacon's personal outlook was bleak; as an <a href="atheist">atheist</a>, he did not believe in either divine intervention nor an afterlife. As such, the work seems to represent a <a href="nihilistic">nihilistic</a> and hopeless view of the human condition. He later dismissed the painting, considering it too literal and explicit. He abandoned the theme of the crucifixion for the following 12 years, not returning to it until the more loosely based, but equally bleak, triptych "<a href="Three%20Studies%20for%20a%20Crucifixion">Three Studies for a Crucifixion</a>". The painting is housed in the <a href="Stedelijk%20Van%20Abbemuseum">Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum</a> in <a href="Eindhoven">Eindhoven</a>, Netherlands.

The upper creature may be a dog or a cat. Blood pours out of its mouth onto the head and body of its prey, a chimera rendered as owl-like with human facial characteristics. The prey unsuccessfully struggles to flee from its captor. The lower figure's human aspect is most notable in the details of its mouth and genitalia. Both figures are positioned in the centre foreground of the canvas, and are each mutilated and covered in blood, their physical discomfort contrasted against the flat, neutral background typical of Bacon's paintings. The figures exhibit many elements found in his early work, noticeably the expressive broad strokes set against the tightness of the flat, nondescript background. The link with the biblical Crucifixion is made through the raised arms of the lower creature, and the T-shaped cross.

The canvas is almost entirely stripped of colour. The T-shaped cross is dark blue; the two figures are painted in a mixture of white and black hues, the white tones dominating. Over half of the work is unpainted, essentially bare canvas. According to the theologian and curator Friedhelm Mennekes, the viewer's attention is thus solely focused "on the figure in agony on the cross, or more precisely: on the mouth, gaping and distorted in its cry". The body of the chimera, or hybrid bird, is rendered with light paint, and from it hang narrow red streams of paint, indicating the drips and spatter of blood. Bacon uses <a href="pentimenti">pentimenti</a> to emphasise the hopelessness of the animal's death throes.

The painting contains the same white angular rails as the mid-grounds of his 1949 "<a href="Head%20II">Head II</a>", "<a href="Head%20VI">Head VI</a>", and "Study for Portrait" of the same year. In this panel, the rails are positioned just below the area where the horizontal and vertical bars of the cross intersect. The rail begins with a diagonal line which intersects the chimera at what appears to be the creature's shoulder. The horizontal angular geometrical shape is sketched in white and grey in the mid-ground, and represents an early form of a spatial device Bacon was to develop and perfect during the 1950s, when it effectively became a cage used to frame the anguished figures portrayed in Bacon's foregrounds. In the mid-ground, the artist has sketched a street scene, which features walking stick figures and cars. The pedestrians appear oblivious to the slaughter before them.

The bleakness of the painting is informed by the artist's harsh nihilism and <a href="existentialist">existentialist</a> view of life. Bacon was raised as a Christian, but according to his friend and biographer <a href="Michael%20Peppiatt">Michael Peppiatt</a>, when he found he could no longer believe he was "extremely disappointed and furious, and anybody with a scrap of religious belief ... he would go for them". Peppiatt makes the observation of Bacon that "if somebody has that intensity, it's almost a faith in and of itself".

The painting has been linked both thematically and in its formal construction to Bacon's 1956 work "<a href="Owls%20%28Francis%20Bacon%29">Owls</a>", and to preparatory sketches only brought to the art market in the late 1990s. The art critic <a href="Armin%20Zweite">Armin Zweite</a> traces the origin of the lower figure to a photograph of an owl that Bacon found in a book on birds in motion; Bacon has replaced the bird's beak with a wide open human mouth.

Screaming mouths appear in many of Bacon's works from the late 1940s to the early 1950s. The motif was developed from sources including medical textbooks, and images of the nurse in the <a href="Potemkin%20Stairs">Odessa Steps</a> sequence in <a href="Sergei%20Eisenstein">Sergei Eisenstein</a>'s 1925 silent film "<a href="Battleship%20Potemkin">Battleship Potemkin</a>". Bacon kept a close-up still of the screaming nurse, at the moment when she has been shot in the eye. He referred to the still in paintings throughout his career.

Bacon tended to draw images in series, and the Odessa nurse become an obsessive motif for him. According to Peppiatt, "it would be no exaggeration to say that, if one could really explain the origins and implications of this scream, one would be far closer to understanding the whole art of Francis Bacon". <a href="Gilles%20Deleuze">Gilles Deleuze</a> wrote that, in Bacon's screams, "the entire body escapes through the mouth".

The panel is one of a number of Bacon's treatments of the biblical crucifixion scene. He also incorporates Greek legend, notably the tale of <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a> and the <a href="Erinyes">Eumenides</a>—or Furies—found in the "<a href="Oresteia">Oresteia</a>", suggested by the broad wings of the chimera. Bacon's imagery became less extreme and more imbued with <a href="pathos">pathos</a> as he got older, and fewer of his canvases contain the sensational imagery that made him famous in the mid-1940s. He admitted that, "When I was younger, I needed extreme subject-matter. Now I don't." According to <a href="John%20Russell%20%28art%20critic%29">John Russell</a>, Bacon found it more effective to reflect violence in his brush strokes and colourisation, rather than "in the thing portrayed".

The title refers to Christian <a href="iconography">iconography</a> of the <a href="Passion%20of%20Jesus">Passion of Jesus</a>. Crucifixion scenes appear from Bacon's earliest works, and appeared frequently throughout his career. Russell writes that, to Bacon, the crucifixion was a "generic name for an environment in which bodily harm is done to one or more persons and one or more other persons gather to watch".

The painting was commissioned by Eric Hall, Bacon's patron and, later, his lover, who in 1933 commissioned three crucifixion paintings. Bacon drew influence from the old masters Grünewald, <a href="Diego%20Vel%C3%A1zquez">Diego Velázquez</a> and <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>, as well as <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Picasso</a>'s late 1920s and early 1930s <a href="Biomorphism">biomorphs</a>. Bacon said that he thought of the crucifixion as a "magnificent <a href="Armature%20%28sculpture%29">armature</a> on which you can hang all types of feeling and sensation".

Elements of the canvas refer to Grünewald's c. 1512–16 "<a href="Isenheim%20Altarpiece">Isenheim Altarpiece</a>" and <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Peter Paul Rubens</a>'s c. 1612–14 "<a href="The%20Descent%20from%20the%20Cross%20%28Rubens%29">Descent from the Cross</a>". According to the art critic Hugh Davies, the open mouth of the victim and the predator leaning over the cross link the painting to Rubens' "Descent". The mouth in Rubens' painting is loosely opened, but in Bacon's it is taut. The main figure's legs are folded out of view and the figure's left arm is passive in Rubens' painting, but in the Bacon's painting the chimera's legs and arms are in violent motion, seemingly wildly flailing up and down.

Horizontal frames often featured in Bacon's 1950s and 1960s paintings. The motif may have been borrowed from the sculptor <a href="Alberto%20Giacometti">Alberto Giacometti</a>, who Bacon greatly admired and often corresponded with. Giacometti had employed the device in "The Nose" (1947) and "The Cage" (1950). Bacon's use of frames has suggested imprisonment to many commentators. Writing on their use in "Fragment", Zweite mentions that the diagonal lines transform the cross into a <a href="guillotine">guillotine</a>.

The religious imagery belies Bacon's atheist and nihilistic outlook. The painting contains no hope for redemption. Friedhelm Mennekes writes that in the victim's scream, "there is not even a lament of being forsaken by God. A god does not emerge for the figure jerking in mortal anguish in the painting". Sharpe identifies the tiny oblivious stick-figure passersby as the element that mostly removes the work from "a straightforward recapitulation of ancient religious iconography and into <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20%281945%E2%80%93present%29">postwar</a> modernity".

Bacon was self-critical, and often destroyed or disowned his own work, including pieces held in high regard by critics and buyers. He came to dislike "Fragment of a Crucifixion", viewing it as too simplistic and explicit, in the words of Russell, "too near the conventions of narrative-painting". This was an issue with which Bacon struggled throughout his career: he aimed to create imagery that would be instantly recognisable, immediate and directly involving for the viewer, while also staying loyal to his creed of producing "non-illustrative painting".

Bacon returned to the crucifixion theme in his 1962 "<a href="Three%20Studies%20for%20a%20Crucifixion">Three Studies for a Crucifixion</a>". That depiction is a more oblique and less literal utilisation of the iconography of the biblical scene, but a more direct invocation of imagery of the slaughterhouse and slabs of meat.

Battle of Warsaw (1705)

The Battle of Warsaw (also known as the Battle of Rakowitz or Rakowiec) was fought on 31July 1705 (<a href="Gregorian%20calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>) near Warsaw, Poland, during the <a href="Great%20Northern%20War">Great Northern War</a>. The battle was part of a power struggle for the <a href="List%20of%20Polish%20monarchs%23Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth%2C%201569%E2%80%931795">Polish–Lithuanian throne</a>. It was fought between <a href="Augustus%20II%20the%20Strong">Augustus II the Strong</a> and <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Leszczy%C5%84ski">Stanisław Leszczyński</a> and their allies. Augustus II entered the Northern war as elector of <a href="Electorate%20of%20Saxony">Saxony</a> and king of the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>, and had formed an alliance with <a href="Denmark%E2%80%93Norway">Denmark–Norway</a> and <a href="Tsardom%20of%20Russia">Russia</a>. Stanisław Leszczyński had seized the Polish throne in 1704, with the support of the <a href="Swedish%20army">Swedish army</a> of <a href="Charles%20XII%20of%20Sweden">Charles XII of Sweden</a>. The struggle for the throne forced the <a href="Polish%20nobility">Polish nobility</a> to pick sides; the <a href="Warsaw%20Confederation%20%281704%29">Warsaw Confederation</a> supported Leszczyński and <a href="Swedish%20Empire">Sweden</a>, and the <a href="Sandomierz%20Confederation">Sandomierz Confederation</a> supported Augustus II and his allies. The conflict resulted in the <a href="Civil%20war%20in%20Poland%20%281704%E2%80%9306%29">Polish civil war of 1704–1706</a>.

In 1705 two events were planned to take place in Warsaw: a session of the <a href="Sejm%20of%20the%20Polish-Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish parliament</a> to formally negotiate peace between Poland and Sweden; and the coronation of Stanisław Leszczyński as the new Polish king. Meanwhile Augustus II and his allies developed a <a href="Campaign%20of%20Grodno">grand strategy</a> that envisioned a combined assault to crush the Swedish forces and restore Augustus II to the Polish throne. Accordingly, an allied army of up to 10,000 cavalry under the command of <a href="Otto%20Arnold%20von%20Paykull">Otto Arnold von Paykull</a> was sent towards Warsaw to interrupt the Polish parliament. The Swedes sent a 2,000-strong cavalry contingent of their own, under the command of <a href="Carl%20Nieroth">Carl Nieroth</a>, to protect it. Encouraged by the fact that he heavily outnumbered the Swedes, Paykull took the initiative and attacked. He managed to cross the <a href="Vistula">Vistula River</a> with his army on 30 July, after a stubborn defence by a few Swedish <a href="Squadron%20%28army%29">squadrons</a>, and reached the plains next to <a href="Rakowiec%2C%20Warsaw">Rakowiec</a>, directly west of Warsaw, on 31 July, where the two forces engaged in an <a href="Battle">open battle</a>.

Augustus II's allied left wing quickly collapsed; after a short but fierce fight, so did the right and centre. Paykull managed to rally some of his troops a few kilometres away, at the village of Odolany, where the fight was renewed. The Swedes again gained the upper hand and, this time, won the battle. They captured Paykull along with letters and other documents which informed the Swedes of the strategic intentions of Augustus II's allies. The coronation of Stanisław Leszczyński occurred in early October. Peace between Poland and Sweden in November 1705 allowed the Swedish king to focus his attention on the Russian threat near <a href="Grodno">Grodno</a>. The subsequent campaign resulted in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Altranst%C3%A4dt%20%281706%29">Treaty of Altranstädt (1706)</a>, by which Augustus II renounced both his claim to the Polish throne and his <a href="Treaty%20of%20Narva">alliance</a> with <a href="Peter%20the%20Great">Peter I of Russia</a>.

After defeating the <a href="Landing%20at%20Humleb%C3%A6k">Danes at Humlebæk</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Narva%20%281700%29">Russians at Narva</a> in 1700, <a href="Charles%20XII%20of%20Sweden">Charles XII of Sweden</a> turned his attention towards his third enemy, <a href="Augustus%20II%20the%20Strong">Augustus II</a> of Poland and <a href="Electorate%20of%20Saxony">Saxony</a>, defeating him in a fierce battle at the <a href="Crossing%20of%20the%20D%C3%BCna">Crossing of the Düna</a> in 1701. The same year, he <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Swedish%20War%20%281701%E2%80%931706%29">launched an invasion</a> of the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> to dethrone Augustus II and install a candidate acceptable to Sweden. After the Swedes' seizure of <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a> and <a href="Sandomierz">Sandomierz</a> and another defeat for Augustus II at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Klisz%C3%B3w">Battle of Kliszów</a>, a growing number of <a href="Polish-Lithuanian%20magnates">Polish-Lithuanian magnates</a> switched sides, in favour of Charles XII.

After further success in the engagements at <a href="battle%20of%20Pultusk%20%281703%29">Pultusk</a> and <a href="Siege%20of%20Thorn%20%281703%29">Toruń</a>, the Swedes proclaimed <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Leszczy%C5%84ski">Stanisław Leszczyński</a> king with the support of the <a href="Warsaw%20Confederation%20%281704%29">Warsaw Confederation</a> of <a href="szlachta">Polish nobles</a>. To oppose him, the <a href="Sandomierz%20Confederation">Sandomierz Confederation</a> was created by other nobles, in support of Augustus II, thus starting the <a href="Civil%20war%20in%20Poland%20%281704%E2%80%9306%29">Polish civil war of 1704–1706</a>. Some smaller engagements at <a href="Battle%20of%20Pozna%C5%84%20%281704%29">Poznań</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Lw%C3%B3w%20%281704%29">Lwów</a>, <a href="Siege%20of%20Warsaw%20%281704%29">Warsaw</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Poniec">Poniec</a> followed in 1704 as a consequence of Augustus II's attempts to restore the situation to his favour.

In 1705 Stanisław Leszczyński was due to be crowned in Warsaw, after which peace negotiations between Sweden and Poland could take place. The Swedes were eager to increase support for Leszczyński to strengthen their position in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The <a href="Great%20Northern%20War%23Allied%20camp">coalition forces</a>, under <a href="Peter%20the%20Great">Peter I of Russia</a> and Augustus II, would not sit idle, and planned a <a href="Campaign%20of%20Grodno%23Plan%20of%20attack">grand strategy</a> of their own, mainly based upon the ideas of <a href="Johann%20Patkul">Johann Patkul</a> and <a href="Otto%20Arnold%20von%20Paykull">Otto Arnold von Paykull</a>; they would gather all available forces and crush the <a href="Swedish%20Army">Swedish Army</a> in Poland–Lithuania by a joint offensive.

The Swedes reconquered Kraków in early 1705, with 4,000 men under Swedish lieutenant <a href="Niels%20Jonsson%20Stromberg%20af%20Clastorp">Nils Stromberg</a>, forcing between 3,000 and 4,000 Saxons to evacuate the city and retreat towards <a href="Lublin">Lublin</a>. This led the nobles of Kraków and Sandomierz to renounce their support for Augustus II in favour of Stanisław Leszczyński; they started to gather in Warsaw for the session of parliament. Further support from the <a href="Ruthenian%20Voivodeship">Ruthenian Voivodeship</a> (duchy) appeared from <a href="Lviv">Lviv</a>, along with <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Potocki">Józef Potocki</a> and his 7,000 troops. These movements were observed by the Saxons, who withdrew from the left bank of the <a href="Vistula">Vistula</a> River completely, along with all Polish troops, and marched towards <a href="Brest%2C%20Belarus">Brest</a> to better coordinate with the Russian army in Lithuania. This meant that the coronation of Stanisław Leszczyński in Warsaw as well as negotiations for peace between Poland and Sweden could safely go ahead. The parliamentary session was scheduled to start on 11 July.

Receiving news of this event, Charles XII of Sweden, headquartered in <a href="Rawicz">Rawicz</a> at the time, sent a contingent of troops from <a href="Gniezno">Gniezno</a> on 6 July consisting of 2,000 cavalry under <a href="Carl%20Nieroth">Carl Nieroth</a> to protect Warsaw. Another 2,000 infantry under Johan Valentin von Daldorff of the <a href="Dalarna%20Regiment">Dala</a> and <a href="Uppland%20Regiment">Uppland Regiment</a>s were also ordered to depart on 29 July from <a href="Kaliszkowice%20O%C5%82obockie">Kaliszkowice Ołobockie</a> as reinforcements, and to form an escort for Stanisław Leszczyński; but they would not arrive at the Polish capital until 11 August, more than a week after the battle.

Nieroth arrived at Warsaw just before 11 July and opened the parliamentary session according to schedule. He established camp just south of the city next to the Vistula River. Meanwhile the Saxons who had been forced out of Krakow and back to Brest departed for Warsaw in early July. They united <a href="banner">banner</a>s with between 5,000 and 6,000 Poles and Lithuanians, led by <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Chom%C4%99towski">Stanisław Chomętowski</a> and <a href="Janusz%20Antoni%20Wi%C5%9Bniowiecki">Janusz Antoni Wiśniowiecki</a>. The overall command of the force was assigned to Otto Arnold von Paykull whose orders from Augustus II were to disrupt the parliamentary session. Paykull's vanguard, under the command of <a href="Adam%20%C5%9Amigielski%20%28d.%201716%29">Adam Śmigielski</a>, soon arrived in the vicinity of <a href="Praga">Praga</a>, on the opposite side of the Vistula from Warsaw, and attempted to cross the river on several occasions.

On 16 July, some 1,000 Poles crossed the river at <a href="Karczew">Karczew</a> and attacked a Swedish guard-post consisting of 20 men. After defending themselves for some time, the Swedes were reinforced by 150 cavalrymen who forced the Poles to retire, leaving behind 30 dead. A further 200 men drowned as they went back over the Vistula River and four men ended up in captivity. Five days later, the Polish commander Stanisław Chomętowski arrived at Praga with 67 banners of Polish–Lithuanian cavalry and 400 Saxons. He attempted to cross the Vistula to Warsaw in boats and ferries. He was repulsed, but the repeated attempts caused the nobility in Warsaw to scatter. Paykull appeared with his full army by the end of the month and immediately overwhelmed two small Swedish reconnaissance units sent by Nieroth to operate on that side of the river. Here some important intelligence was gained, informing Paykull of the exact strength of the enemy, hardly 2,000 men, as well as the condition of the river.

Paykull held a council of war, and planned a joint strike on Nieroth's vulnerable cavalry before the arrival of further Swedish reinforcements. Nieroth, being informed of their intentions on 28 July, split off two small units, with 186 men in each, under the commands of <a href="Jon%20St%C3%A5lhammar">Jon Stålhammar</a> and <a href="Claes%20Bonde">Claes Bonde</a>, to scout for the enemy in the vicinity of the Vistula river. As the river proved to be shallower than usual for July, the Swedish command had trouble predicting where Paykull could and would commit.

The scouting party under Stålhammar was ordered to search south-southeast towards <a href="G%C3%B3ra%20Kalwaria">Góra Kalwaria</a> while Bonde scouted as far as <a href="Kazu%C5%84%20Nowy">Kazuń Nowy</a>, north-west of Warsaw. Thus more than 70 kilometres of the Vistula River were patrolled. On 29 July, Paykull committed to an attack with his Saxons, Poles and Lithuanians. He intended to cross the river some north-west of Warsaw, near <a href="Zakroczym">Zakroczym</a>, which Bonde received intelligence of during the night of 29–30 July, while in Kazuń Nowy. With a mere 26 men he rapidly marched to investigate before the arrival of his remaining 160 troops.

He arrived there in the morning and soon found the <a href="vanguard">vanguard</a> of Paykull's army, consisting of 500 men who had just completed the crossing in advance of the bulk of their army. Despite being massively outnumbered, Bonde followed his instructions to prevent any attempt made by the coalition to cross the river. Almost immediately the small party attacked their enemies, but after a desperate fight, they were cut down to the last man. The remaining 160 Swedes arrived at the scene, followed the example of their leader, and attacked. By this time about half of the coalition forces, approximately 5,000 men, were across. The Swedes were encircled, and after a sharp battle, repulsed, with a loss of about 100 men killed or captured. Only one of the initial three squadrons of some 80 men managed to retreat back to Warsaw and notify Nieroth of the action.

The seemingly foolish act at the beaches near Zakroczym caused the coalition troops under Paykull to suffer some lost momentum which allowed Nieroth more time to organise his troops for the forthcoming battle. The Polish military commander <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Poniatowski%20%281676%E2%80%931762%29">Stanisław Poniatowski</a>, a supporter of Stanisław Leszczyński, wrote afterwards: "The bravery and fearlessness which the Swedish officer [Bonde] had displayed, caused some terror to be struck into our enemies". Von Paykull remained confident, and sent a courier to Augustus II, informing him that the Swedes were on the run and the parliament in Warsaw scattered. He added, "I hope to deliver the furious and wild Swedish lad to your Majesty within 14 days, dead or alive".

When Nieroth was informed of Paykull's crossing on the afternoon of 30 July, he decided that he was not properly equipped to withstand a siege. Instead he marched his army past Warsaw to about north-west of the city to receive the coalition forces there, in an open battle. As it was already far into the evening by the time he arrived, and with no sign of the enemy, he chose to go back and position his troops between Warsaw and <a href="Rakowiec%2C%20Warsaw">Rakowiec</a>, just west of the initial Swedish camp. At sunrise, around 04:00 in the morning, on 31 July, he received intelligence that Paykull was marching towards him along the road from <a href="B%C5%82onie">Błonie</a>, west of Warsaw. Soon afterwards, Nieroth drew his army up in battle order and marched towards <a href="Wola">Wola</a> to face the advancing enemy.

The Swedish force under the command of Nieroth consisted of between 1,800 and 2,000 men in three <a href="regiment">regiment</a>s, divided into 24 <a href="Squadron%20%28army%29">squadrons</a> (eight squadrons in each regiment) with one <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> of infantry. The Swedish regiments were positioned, from left to right: 800 men from the <a href="%C3%96sterg%C3%B6tland%20Cavalry%20Regiment">Östergötland Cavalry Regiment</a>; 400 men from the Upplands tremännings Cavalry Regiment (also known as Kruse's Cavalry Regiment); and 740 men from the Småland Cavalry Regiment under the commands of <a href="Jacob%20Burensk%C3%B6ld">Jacob Burensköld</a>, Carl Nieroth and <a href="Carl%20Gustaf%20Kruse">Carl Gustaf Kruse</a>, respectively. A company of 60 infantry from the <a href="Skaraborg%20Regiment%20%28infantry%29">Skaraborg Infantry Regiment</a> under captain <a href="Sven%20Kafle">Sven Kafle</a> had also arrived the day before and took position on the far right.

The Saxons and Polish–Lithuanians were between 8,000 and 10,000 men strong under the overall command of Otto Arnold von Paykull. The Saxons were positioned in the centre with the Lithuanians to their left and the Poles to their right. The Saxon force included some 3,500 men in 12 different regiments, totaling 43 squadrons.

The first Saxon line, under the personal command of Paykull with the generals <a href="Daniel%20Bodo%20von%20der%20Schulenburg">Daniel Schulenburg</a> and Saint Paul assisting, included, in order from left to right: the Life Guard (Leib) <a href="Dragoon">Dragoon</a> Regiment; the Milkau Dragoon Regiment; the Gersdorff <a href="Cuirassier">Cuirassier</a> Regiment; the Steinau Cuirassier Regiment; and the Life Guard (Leib) Cuirassier Regiment. Each regiment had 250 men divided into three squadrons. Furthest to the right was the <a href="Garde%20du%20Corps">Garde du Corps</a> Cavalry Regiment with 500 men in four squadrons.

The second Saxon line included, in order from left to right: the Schulenburg Dragoon Regiment; the Goltz Dragoon Regiment; the Flemming's Cuirassiers; the Crown Prince (Kurprinz) Cuirassier Regiment; the Queen's (Königin) Cuirassier Regiment; and the Brause Dragoon Regiment, each with 240 men in three squadrons.

The Saxon reserve line consisted of a group of handpicked cuirassiers to the left, with 200 men in three squadrons, and the Eichstadt Cuirassier Regiment to the right, with 225 men in three squadrons.

The Poles and Lithuanians fielded between 5,000 and 6,000 men. The Poles, with around 2,600 men, were positioned on the right wing with 40 banners (each banner was about 65 men) and were commanded by Stanisław Chomętowski, <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Ernest%20Denhoff">Stanisław Ernest Denhoff</a> and <a href="Felicjan%20Czermi%C5%84ski">Felicjan Czermiński</a>. The Lithuanians on the left wing consisted of some 2,300 to 3,300 men in 35 to 50 banners (each banner with about 65 men), and were commanded by <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Mateusz%20Rzewuski">Stanisław Mateusz Rzewuski</a> and Janusz Antoni Wiśniowiecki.

Both armies had some difficulties as they marched towards each other, as high grain covered much of the field. Furthermore, the unusually hot and dry summer contributed to large dust clouds being raised, which were swept by strong westerly winds to obscure vision. The Swedes in particular struggled, with the wind in their faces. After they had marched , the armies sighted each other and advanced to battle. Both armies soon confirmed the great disparity in numbers between them. The Saxon and Polish–Lithuanian force (even with two lines, three men deep, and a reserve line behind) was double the width of the Swedish force (with one line, no more than two men deep, and no reserve).

Paykull took advantage of the situation and quickly ordered his wings to stretch out further before impact, in an attempt to completely encircle the Swedes. The commanders of each Swedish regiment drew further out to the sides themselves, to somewhat match the width of their opponents lines. This action caused the Swedish line to split in two and left an opening in the centre between the Östgöta and Uppland regiments. Soon afterwards the general of the Östgöta Regiment on the left wing, Burensköld, sent Nieroth an urgent plea for reinforcements, as his regiment alone was about to face more than half, around 5,000, of the enemy force. Nieroth, who was with the Uppland and Småland regiments further to the right, and heavily outnumbered himself, had no choice but to decline the request.

At around 08:00 in the morning, just north of the village of Rakowiec, west of Warsaw, the two sides collided. After enduring a volley from their enemies the Swedes charged, sword in hand, along the whole front in their typical <a href="Caroleans%23Cavalry%20G%C3%A5%E2%80%93P%C3%A5">Carolean formations</a>. As the Swedes charged, Paykull, who had acknowledged the split in the Swedish centre, quickly ordered six squadrons of the Life Guard Dragoons, Milkau Dragoons and Gersdorff Cuirassiers to exploit the opening. They struck the Uppland Regiment in their left flank, as they were committing to the <a href="frontal%20assault">frontal assault</a>. This caused confusion among the four squadrons furthest to the left of the regiment, which fell into disorder and lost three <a href="Military%20colours%2C%20standards%20and%20guidons">standards</a>.

Simultaneously, the Saxon squadrons furthest to the left, along with the Lithuanian cavalry, almost immediately collapsed and <a href="rout">rout</a>ed at the impact of the charge. They were briskly pursued by the Småland Regiment and the other half of the Uppland Regiment, under Nieroth, that had not been hit in the flank. Some Lithuanians at the end of the wing, whose banners extended further than the width of the Swedish line, had initially proceeded with the flanking manoeuvre; they were soon driven off as some squadrons of the Småland Regiment turned their attention towards them, pursuing and harassing them for in a northerly direction.

As the Uppland and Småland regiments collided with their enemies on the Swedish right wing, the left wing under Burensköld and his Östgöta Regiment simultaneously charged home into the Saxons opposing them. After a short but fierce fight, the first Saxon line was forced to quit, dragging the second line with them in the retreat. The Poles, being furthest out on the wing where the Swedish line did not extend, had managed to partially encircle the Swedes, and started to attack their flank and rear as they pursued the Saxons. This gave the Saxons enough breathing room to rally some of their troops and counterattack. The Swedish Östgöta Regiment was then forced to split their squadrons in two by leaving a few to halt the Poles in the rear, the others facing the counter-attacking Saxons to their front.

The four Swedish squadrons of the Uppland Regiment under <a href="Carl%20Philip%20Sack">Carl Philip Sack</a> had during this time managed to rally their banners and in turn push back the six Saxon squadrons that had hit them in the flank in the early stage of the engagement. They then rushed to the aid of the vulnerable Östgöta Regiment along with the Skaraborg Regiment under Sven Kafle, causing the Poles and Saxons to retreat once more, unable to handle the pressure. This would end the fighting near Rakowiec.

As the Swedes of the Östgöta Regiment reached the village of Wola in their pursuit of the Saxons, they discovered that Paykull had reorganised his forces at the nearby village of Odolany. Some time was spent resting the exhausted horses and regrouping the available squadrons before recommencing the attack. Soon the other four squadrons of the Uppland Regiment arrived, although very depleted after the fighting at Rakowiec.

Paykull had positioned his Saxon troops very advantageously, with the left flank protected by a hedge towards Odolany, and on the right a large force of Poles, with two hidden Saxon squadrons of the Garde du Corps, ready to fall upon the rear of the Swedes. All of his Saxon squadrons were present, except for the six that he had committed to attack the centre of the Swedish army in the previous fight. He was further encouraged by the fact that his troops outnumbered the Swedes four to one, even without reckoning the Poles on the right. So he envisioned that he would be able to crush the few Swedes in front of him and then turn against the rest of the Swedish force, who were for the time being occupied with chasing the Lithuanians.

Having disposed his troops, with the Uppland Regiment on the left, Burensköld commenced his attack. As the Swedes charged forward, the two hidden Saxon squadrons fell onto the rear of their left flank, causing some disorder. The Saxon left wing, where Paykull remained, collapsed even before impact, and ran. Two Swedish squadrons were then sent to assist in the ongoing fight, as the rest pursued the fleeing enemy. Order was restored on the left wing after some fierce fighting, when the 60 infantrymen from the Skaraborg Regiment arrived in time to give a strong volley from their muskets to end the struggle.

Paykull was captured as the Swedes pursued the fleeing enemy for about . He had fallen into a ditch and was about to be killed by two Swedish cavalrymen before a third, Magnus Rydberg, intervened. The Swedes under Burensköld called off the pursuit, being unaware of the course of the rest of the battle, and returned towards Warsaw.

The Swedes started to move their forces towards Warsaw in the afternoon, after having pursued their enemies for many kilometres in different directions. Some Poles, who had crossed the Vistula from Praga during the battle to loot, were chased back over the river by the Småland Regiment, where 300 to 500 of them drowned. The battle had lasted for six hours, from 8:00 in the morning to 2:00 in the afternoon.

123 Saxons and 17 Poles had been captured, including Paykull. Some 300 to 500 Saxons had been killed and almost as many Poles and Lithuanians. In total, they had suffered between 1,000 and 2,000 men dead, wounded and captured in the battle. The Swedes had sustained 144 men killed, 143 wounded and five men captured. Many horses were also lost. In just the Östgöta Regiment, 178 horses were dead and 70 wounded. After the battle the regiment could field only about 550 men, down from 800; the rest were dead, wounded, without horses or scattered.

It is clear that Paykull had not received orders from Augustus II that encouraged him to give battle to the Swedes; he was only to interrupt the coronation of Stanisław Leszczyński. In this he initially succeeded, as many of the noblemen in Warsaw fled at his presence by the Vistula River, and would have remained scattered as long as he posed a threat with his army. Historians have concluded that the size of his army, at least 8,000 men, compared with the smaller Swedish force that awaited reinforcements, made him eager to seek battle with them while they were heavily outnumbered.

The scattered Polish noblemen, receiving notice of the victory, eventually returned and proceeded with the coronation of Stanisław Leszczyński and the declaration of peace between Sweden and Poland. Meanwhile, Augustus II's allies obtained reinforcements of about 1,000 Russians and once again threatened to disrupt the parliament, until the two Swedish infantry regiments under Johan Valentin von Daldorff finally arrived, on 11 August, with Stanisław Leszczyński and the Swedish ambassadors. This put a temporary end to the ambitions of Augustus II's allies, forcing them to withdraw towards Lithuania and unite with the <a href="Russian%20Army">Russian Army</a> stationed there.

The main Swedish army at Rawicz, under Charles XII, struck camp at 8 August and marched towards <a href="Krotoszyn">Krotoszyn</a>, where the captured Otto Arnold von Paykull was taken under strict military surveillance, for an audience with the king. Some letters and documents Paykull had carried with him during the battle, which he had tried to discard before his imminent capture, had been brought with him to Krotoszyn. The documents informed Charles XII of the greater allied plan, under which the <a href="Tsar">Tsar</a>, Peter I of Russia, intended to march into Warsaw on 30 August at the head of 40,000 men and put an end to the parliament. This would, they thought, provoke Charles XII to take action and march with the Swedish army to Warsaw, where he would find himself surrounded by <a href="Johann%20Matthias%20von%20der%20Schulenburg">Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg</a> and his 20,000 men, who were assembling in Saxony, to move into Poland and attack the Swedes in the rear. Charles XII, who had long sought a decisive battle with the coalition forces, indicated no sign of panic at this, but simply stated to his ministers: "I wish the enemy may keep their word". On 10 August, he once again struck camp and commenced a rapid march with his army towards Błonie, close to Warsaw, arriving on 17 August. He had left General <a href="Carl%20Gustaf%20Rehnski%C3%B6ld">Carl Gustaf Rehnskiöld</a> with 10,000 men near <a href="Pozna%C5%84">Poznań</a> to guard against the main Saxon army under Schulenburg which threatened to enter Poland.

The Russian Tsar abandoned his plans after seeing how two of his and Augustus II's armies had already suffered defeat at the hands of the Swedes: the one under <a href="Boris%20Sheremetev">Boris Sheremetev</a> that faced <a href="Adam%20Ludwig%20Lewenhaupt">Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt</a> in <a href="Courland">Courland</a>, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gemauerthof">Battle of Gemauerthof</a>, and now at the Battle of Warsaw, between Paykull and Nieroth. As he no longer dared to fully commit in Poland, he decided to instead let his main army under <a href="Georg%20Benedict%20Ogilvy">Georg Benedict Ogilvy</a> await the Swedes behind the strongly fortified defences of <a href="Grodno">Grodno</a>, in Lithuania. He would attempt to lure Charles XII there, while the Saxon army under Schulenburg would enter Poland from the west, and attack him in the rear. These developments would result in the <a href="Campaign%20of%20Grodno">Campaign of Grodno</a>.
Stanisław Leszczyński's coronation, as Stanisław I of Poland, was completed on 4 October, with no further interference from Augustus II's allies. After some smaller skirmishes outside, or near, Warsaw, among them an <a href="Battle%20of%20Praga%20%281705%29">attempt made</a> to destroy the recently Swedish-constructed bridge connecting Warsaw and Praga, <a href="Treaty%20of%20Warsaw%20%281705%29">peace between Sweden and Poland</a> was finally established on 28 November. These developments allowed Charles XII to break camp on 9 January 1706 with his 20,000 men, and march towards the <a href="Battle%20of%20Grodno%20%281706%29">Russians at Grodno</a>, where he partly encircled the city and starved them out. Meanwhile, the Saxon army under Schulenburg was defeated by Rehnskiöld at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fraustadt">Battle of Fraustadt</a>. This would result in a <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Swedish%20War%20%281701%E2%80%931706%29%23War%20in%20Saxony">Swedish invasion of Saxony</a> and the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Altranst%C3%A4dt%20%281706%29">Treaty of Altranstädt (1706)</a>, by which Augustus II renounced all his claims to the Polish throne.

Paykull, the captured allied general, had been born in <a href="Swedish%20Livonia">Swedish Livonia</a>, and was legally considered a Swedish subject; he was thus considered a traitor to the nation for having taken up arms against it. He was shipped to Sweden and put on trial in Stockholm, sentenced to death by <a href="decapitation">decapitation</a>, and executed on 14 February 1707.

Parkinson's disease

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a long-term <a href="neurodegeneration">degenerative disorder</a> of the <a href="central%20nervous%20system">central nervous system</a> that mainly affects the <a href="motor%20system">motor system</a>. As the disease worsens, non-motor symptoms become increasingly common. The symptoms generally come on slowly over time. Early in the disease, the most obvious are <a href="tremor">shaking</a>, <a href="Spasticity">rigidity</a>, <a href="Hypokinesia%23Bradykinesia">slowness of movement</a>, and <a href="gait%20abnormality">difficulty with walking</a>. <a href="Cognition">Thinking</a> and behavioral problems may also occur. <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease%20dementia">Dementia</a> becomes common in the advanced stages of the disease. <a href="major%20depressive%20disorder">Depression</a> and anxiety are also common, occurring in more than a third of people with PD. Other symptoms include sensory, <a href="Sleep%20disorder">sleep</a>, and <a href="emotion">emotion</a>al problems. The main motor symptoms are collectively called "<a href="parkinsonism">parkinsonism</a>", or a "parkinsonian syndrome".
The cause of Parkinson's disease is generally <a href="idiopathy">unknown</a>, but believed to involve both <a href="Heredity">genetic</a> and environmental factors. Those with a family member affected are more likely to get the disease themselves. There is also an increased risk in people exposed to certain <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s and among those who have had prior <a href="Head%20injury">head injuries</a>, while there is a reduced risk in <a href="Tobacco%20smoking">tobacco smokers</a> and those who drink <a href="coffee">coffee</a> or <a href="tea">tea</a>. The motor symptoms of the disease result from the death of cells in the <a href="substantia%20nigra">substantia nigra</a>, a region of the <a href="midbrain">midbrain</a>. This results in not enough <a href="dopamine">dopamine</a> in these areas. The reason for this <a href="cell%20death">cell death</a> is poorly understood, but involves the build-up of <a href="protein">protein</a>s into <a href="Lewy%20body">Lewy bodies</a> in the <a href="neuron">neuron</a>s. Diagnosis of typical cases is mainly based on symptoms, with tests such as <a href="neuroimaging">neuroimaging</a> being used to rule out other diseases.
There is no <a href="cure">cure</a> for Parkinson's disease, with treatment directed at improving symptoms. Initial treatment is typically with the <a href="antiparkinson%20medication">antiparkinson medication</a> <a href="L-DOPA">levodopa</a> (L-DOPA), with <a href="dopamine%20agonist">dopamine agonist</a>s being used once levodopa becomes less effective. As the disease progresses and neurons continue to be lost, these medications become less effective while at the same time they produce a <a href="side%20effect">complication</a> marked by <a href="dyskinesia">involuntary writhing movements</a>. Diet and some forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at improving symptoms. <a href="Neurosurgery">Surgery</a> to place <a href="microelectrode">microelectrode</a>s for <a href="deep%20brain%20stimulation">deep brain stimulation</a> has been used to reduce motor symptoms in severe cases where drugs are ineffective. Evidence for treatments for the non-movement-related symptoms of PD, such as sleep disturbances and emotional problems, is less strong.
In 2015, PD affected 6.2 million people and resulted in about 117,400 deaths globally. Parkinson's disease typically occurs in people over the age of 60, of which about one percent are affected. Males are more often affected than females at a ratio of around 3:2. When it is seen in people before the age of 50, it is called early-onset PD. The average <a href="life%20expectancy">life expectancy</a> following diagnosis is between 7 and 14 years. The disease is named after the English doctor <a href="James%20Parkinson">James Parkinson</a>, who published the first detailed description in "An Essay on the Shaking Palsy", in 1817. Public awareness campaigns include World Parkinson's Day (on the birthday of James Parkinson, 11 April) and the use of a red <a href="tulip">tulip</a> as the symbol of the disease. People with Parkinson's who have increased the public's awareness of the condition include actor <a href="Michael%20J.%20Fox">Michael J. Fox</a>, Olympic cyclist <a href="Davis%20Phinney">Davis Phinney</a>, and professional boxer <a href="Muhammad%20Ali">Muhammad Ali</a>.
The movement difficulties found in PD are called <a href="parkinsonism">parkinsonism</a> and a number of different disorders feature parkinsonism. "Parkinsonism" is defined as <a href="bradykinesia">bradykinesia</a> (slowness in initiating voluntary movements, with progressive reduction in speed and range of repetitive actions such as voluntary finger-tapping) in combination with one of three other physical signs: muscular (<a href="lead-pipe%20rigidity">lead-pipe</a> or <a href="cogwheel%20rigidity">cogwheel</a>) rigidity, <a href="tremor">tremor</a> at rest, and <a href="Balance%20disorder">postural instability</a>.

Parkinson's disease is the most common form of parkinsonism and is sometimes called "idiopathic parkinsonism", meaning parkinsonism with no identifiable cause. Identifiable causes of parkinsonism include toxins, infections, side effects of drugs, metabolic derangement, and brain lesions such as strokes. Several neurodegenerative disorders also may present with parkinsonism and are sometimes referred to as "atypical parkinsonism" or <a href="Parkinson%20plus%20syndrome">"Parkinson plus"</a> syndromes (illnesses with parkinsonism plus some other features distinguishing them from PD). They include <a href="multiple%20system%20atrophy">multiple system atrophy</a>, <a href="progressive%20supranuclear%20palsy">progressive supranuclear palsy</a>, <a href="corticobasal%20degeneration">corticobasal degeneration</a>, and <a href="dementia%20with%20Lewy%20bodies">dementia with Lewy bodies</a> (DLB).

Scientists sometimes refer to Parkinson’s disease as a <a href="synucleinopathy">synucleinopathy</a> (due to an abnormal accumulation of <a href="alpha-synuclein">alpha-synuclein</a> protein in the brain) to distinguish it from other neurodegenerative diseases, such as <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a> where the brain accumulates <a href="tau%20protein">tau protein</a>. Considerable clinical and pathological overlap exists between <a href="tauopathy">tauopathies</a> and synucleinopathies. In contrast to Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease presents most commonly with memory loss, and the cardinal signs of Parkinson's disease (slowness, tremor, stiffness, and postural instability) are not normal features of Alzheimer's.

Dementia with Lewy bodies is another synucleinopathy and it has close pathological similarities with PD, especially with the subset of PD cases with <a href="dementia">dementia</a> known as <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease%20dementia">Parkinson's disease dementia</a>. The relationship between PD and DLB is complex and incompletely understood. They may represent parts of a continuum with variable distinguishing clinical and pathological features or they may prove to be separate diseases.

The most recognizable symptoms in Parkinson's disease are movement ("motor") related. Non-motor symptoms, which include <a href="autonomic%20nervous%20system">autonomic</a> dysfunction, <a href="neuropsychiatry">neuropsychiatric</a> problems (mood, cognition, behavior or thought alterations), and sensory (especially altered sense of smell) and sleep difficulties, are also common. Some of these non-motor symptoms may be present at the time of diagnosis.

Four motor symptoms are considered <a href="Cardinal%20sign%20%28pathology%29">cardinal</a> in PD: tremor, slowness of movement (bradykinesia), rigidity, and postural instability.

The most common presenting sign is a coarse slow <a href="tremor">tremor</a> of the hand at rest which disappears during voluntary movement of the affected arm and in the deeper stages of sleep. It typically appears in only one hand, eventually affecting both hands as the disease progresses. Frequency of PD tremor is between 4 and 6 <a href="hertz">hertz</a> (cycles per second). A feature of tremor is "pill-rolling", the tendency of the index finger and thumb to touch and perform together a circular movement. The term derives from the similarity between the movement of people with PD and the early pharmaceutical technique of manually making pills.

<a href="Bradykinesia">Bradykinesia</a> (slowness of movement) is found in every case of PD, and is due to disturbances in <a href="motor%20planning">motor planning</a> of movement initiation, and associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation to execution of a movement. Performance of sequential and simultaneous movement is impaired. Bradykinesia is the most handicapping symptom of Parkinson’s disease leading to difficulties with everyday tasks such as dressing, feeding, and bathing. It leads to particular difficulty in carrying out two independent motor activities at the same time and can be made worse by emotional stress or concurrent illnesses. Paradoxically patients with Parkinson's disease can often ride a bicycle or climb stairs more easily than walk on a level. While most physicians may readily notice bradykinesia, formal assessment requires a patient to do repetitive movements with their fingers and feet.

<a href="Hypokinesia">Rigidity</a> is stiffness and resistance to limb movement caused by increased <a href="muscle%20tone">muscle tone</a>, an excessive and continuous contraction of muscles. In parkinsonism the rigidity can be uniform ("<a href="lead-pipe%20rigidity">lead-pipe rigidity</a>") or ratchety ("<a href="cogwheel%20rigidity">cogwheel rigidity</a>"). The combination of tremor and increased tone is considered to be at the origin of cogwheel rigidity. Rigidity may be associated with joint pain; such pain being a frequent initial manifestation of the disease. In early stages of Parkinson's disease, rigidity is often asymmetrical and it tends to affect the neck and shoulder muscles prior to the muscles of the face and extremities. With the progression of the disease, rigidity typically affects the whole body and reduces the ability to move.

<a href="Balance%20disorder">Postural instability</a> is typical in the later stages of the disease, leading to impaired balance and frequent falls, and secondarily to <a href="bone%20fracture">bone fracture</a>s, loss of confidence, and reduced mobility. Instability is often absent in the initial stages, especially in younger people, especially prior to the development of bilateral symptoms. Up to 40% of people diagnosed with PD may experience falls and around 10% may have falls weekly, with the number of falls being related to the severity of PD.

Other recognized motor signs and symptoms include gait and posture disturbances such as <a href="Parkinsonian%20gait">festination</a> (rapid shuffling steps and a <a href="camptocormia">forward-flexed posture</a> when walking with no flexed arm swing). Freezing of gait (brief arrests when the feet seem to get stuck to the floor, especially on turning or changing direction), a slurred monotonous quiet voice, mask-like facial expression, and handwriting that gets smaller and smaller are other common signs.

Parkinson's disease can cause <a href="Neuropsychiatry">neuropsychiatric</a> disturbances, which can range from mild to severe. This includes disorders of cognition, mood, behavior, and thought.

Cognitive disturbances can occur in the early stages of the disease and sometimes prior to diagnosis, and increase in prevalence with duration of the disease. The most common cognitive deficit in PD is <a href="executive%20dysfunction">executive dysfunction</a>, which can include problems with planning, <a href="cognitive%20flexibility">cognitive flexibility</a>, abstract thinking, rule acquisition, <a href="Inhibitory%20control">inhibiting inappropriate actions</a>, initiating appropriate actions, <a href="working%20memory">working memory</a>, and <a href="Attentional%20control">control of attention</a>. Other cognitive difficulties include <a href="bradyphrenia">slowed cognitive processing speed</a>, impaired <a href="Recall%20%28memory%29">recall</a> and impaired perception and estimation of time. Nevertheless, improvement appears when recall is aided by cues. Visuospatial difficulties are also part of the disease, seen for example when the individual is asked to perform tests of facial recognition and perception of the orientation of drawn lines.

A person with PD has two to six times the risk of dementia compared to the general population. Up to 78% of people with PD have Parkinson's disease dementia. The prevalence of dementia increases with age and, to a lesser degree, duration of the disease. Dementia is associated with a reduced <a href="quality%20of%20life">quality of life</a> in people with PD and their <a href="caregiver">caregiver</a>s, increased mortality, and a higher probability of needing <a href="nursing%20home%20care">nursing home care</a>.

Impulse control disorders including pathological gambling, compulsive sexual behavior, binge eating, compulsive shopping and reckless generosity can be caused by medication, particularly orally active dopamine agonists. The <a href="dopamine%20dysregulation%20syndrome">dopamine dysregulation syndrome</a> – with wanting of medication leading to overusage – is a rare complication of levodopa use.

Behavior and mood alterations are more common in PD without cognitive impairment than in the general population, and are usually present in PD with dementia. The most frequent mood difficulties are <a href="Depression%20%28mood%29">depression</a>, <a href="apathy">apathy</a>, and <a href="anxiety">anxiety</a>. Establishing the diagnosis of depression is complicated by the fact that the body language of depression may masquerade as PD including a sad expressionless anxious face, a hang dog appearance, slow movement, and monotonous speech. Up to 30% of people with PD may experience symptoms of anxiety, ranging from a <a href="generalized%20anxiety%20disorder">generalized anxiety disorder</a> to <a href="social%20phobia">social phobia</a>, <a href="panic%20disorder">panic disorder</a>s and <a href="obsessive%20compulsive%20disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</a>s. They contribute to impaired quality of life and increased severity of motor symptoms such as on/off fluctuations or freezing episodes.

<a href="Punding">Punding</a> in which complicated repetitive aimless <a href="Stereotypy">stereotyped behaviors</a> occur for many hours is another disturbance caused by anti-Parkinson medication.

<a href="Hallucination">Hallucination</a>s or <a href="delusion">delusion</a>s occur in approximately 50% of people with PD over the course of the illness, and may herald the emergence of dementia. These range from minor hallucinations – "sense of passage" (something quickly passing beside the person) or "sense of presence" (the perception of something/someone standing just to the side or behind the person) – to full blown vivid, <a href="Positive%20visual%20phenomena%23Hallucinations">formed visual hallucinations</a> and <a href="paranoid">paranoid</a> ideation. Auditory hallucinations are uncommon in PD, and are rarely described as voices. It is now believed that psychosis is an integral part of the disease. A psychosis with delusions and associated <a href="delirium">delirium</a> is a recognized complication of anti-Parkinson drug treatment and may also be caused by urinary tract infections (as frequently occurs in the fragile elderly), but drugs and infection are not the only factors, and underlying brain pathology or changes in neurotransmitters or their receptors (e.g., acetylcholine, serotonin) are also thought to play a role in psychosis in PD.

In addition to neuropsychiatric and motor symptoms, PD can impair other functions.

<a href="Sleep%20disorder">Sleep disorders</a> are a feature of the disease and can be worsened by medications. Symptoms can manifest as daytime <a href="somnolence">drowsiness</a> (including sudden sleep attacks resembling <a href="narcolepsy">narcolepsy</a>), disturbances in <a href="Rapid%20eye%20movement%20sleep">REM</a> sleep, or <a href="insomnia">insomnia</a>. <a href="Rapid%20eye%20movement%20sleep%20behavior%20disorder">REM behavior disorder</a> (RBD), in which patients act out dreams, sometimes injuring themselves or their bed partner, may begin many years before the development of motor or cognitive features of PD or <a href="dementia%20with%20Lewy%20bodies">DLB</a>.

Alterations in the <a href="autonomic%20nervous%20system">autonomic nervous system</a> can lead to <a href="orthostatic%20hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</a> (low blood pressure upon standing), <a href="Seborrhea">oily skin</a> and excessive sweating, <a href="urinary%20incontinence">urinary incontinence</a>, and altered sexual function. <a href="Constipation">Constipation</a> and <a href="Intestinal%20pseudoobstruction">impaired stomach emptying (gastric dysmotility)</a> can be severe enough to cause discomfort and even endanger health. Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell, disturbed vision, pain, and <a href="paresthesia">paresthesia</a> (tingling and numbness). All of these symptoms can occur years before diagnosis of the disease.

Exposure to <a href="pesticides">pesticides</a> and a history of head injury have each been linked with Parkinson disease (PD), but the risks are modest. Never having smoked cigarettes, and never drinking caffeinated beverages, are also associated with small increases in risk of developing PD.

Low concentrations of <a href="Uric%20acid">urate</a> in the blood <a href="Serous%20fluid">serum</a> is associated with an increased risk of PD.

Research indicates that PD is the product of a complex interaction of genetic and <a href="environmental%20factor">environmental factor</a>s. Around 15% of individuals with PD have a <a href="First-degree%20relatives">first-degree relative</a> who has the disease, and 5–10% of people with PD are known to have forms of the disease that occur because of a <a href="mutation">mutation</a> in one of several specific genes. Harboring one of these gene mutations may not lead to the disease; susceptibility factors put the individual at an increased risk, often in combination with other risk factors, which also affect age of onset, severity and progression.

Genes implicated in the development of PD include <a href="Alpha-synuclein">SNCA</a>, <a href="LRRK2">LRRK2</a>, <a href="Glucocerebrosidase">GBA</a>, <a href="Parkin%20%28ligase%29">PRKN</a>, <a href="PINK1">PINK1</a>, <a href="PARK7">PARK7</a>, <a href="VPS35">VPS35</a>, <a href="EIF4G1">EIF4G1</a>, <a href="DNAJC13">DNAJC13</a> and <a href="CHCHD2">CHCHD2</a>.

About 5% of people with PD have mutations in the <a href="GBA1">GBA1</a> gene. These muations are present in < 1% of the unaffected population. The risk of developing PD is increased 20-30 fold if these muations are present. PD associated with these mutations has the same clinical features but an earlier age of onset and a more rapid cognitive and motor decline. 

SNCA gene mutations are important in PD because the protein which this gene encodes, <a href="alpha-synuclein">alpha-synuclein</a>, is the main component of the <a href="Lewy%20body">Lewy bodies</a> that accumulate in the brains of people with PD. Mutations in some genes, including SNCA, LRRK2 and GBA, have been found to be risk factors for "sporadic" (non-familial) PD. Mutations in the gene LRRK2 are the most common known cause of familial and sporadic PD, accounting for approximately 5% of individuals with a family history of the disease and 3% of sporadic cases. A mutation in GBA presents the greatest genetic risk of developing Parkinsons disease.

Several Parkinson-related genes are involved in the function of <a href="lysosome">lysosome</a>s, organelles that digest cellular waste products. It has been suggested that some cases of PD may be caused by <a href="Lysosomal%20storage%20disease">lysosomal disorders</a> that reduce the ability of cells to break down alpha-synuclein.

The main <a href="Pathology">pathological</a> characteristics of PD are cell death in the brain's <a href="basal%20ganglia">basal ganglia</a> (affecting up to 70% of the <a href="dopaminergic">dopamine secreting</a> neurons in the <a href="substantia%20nigra">substantia nigra</a> <a href="pars%20compacta">pars compacta</a> by the end of life) and the presence of <a href="Lewy%20body">Lewy bodies</a> (accumulations of the protein <a href="alpha-synuclein">alpha-synuclein</a>) in many of the remaining neurons. This loss of neurons is accompanied by the death of <a href="astrocyte">astrocyte</a>s (star-shaped <a href="neuroglia">glial</a> cells) and a significant increase in the number of <a href="microglia">microglia</a> (another type of glial cell) in the substantia nigra.

There are five major pathways in the brain connecting other brain areas with the basal ganglia. These are known as the <a href="Motor%20cortex">motor</a>, <a href="Frontal%20eye%20fields">oculo-motor</a>, <a href="Cerebral%20cortex%23Association%20areas">associative</a>, <a href="Limbic%20system">limbic</a> and <a href="Orbitofrontal%20cortex">orbitofrontal</a> circuits, with names indicating the main projection area of each circuit. All of them are affected in PD, and their disruption explains many of the symptoms of the disease, since these circuits are involved in a wide variety of functions, including movement, attention and learning. Scientifically, the motor circuit has been examined the most intensively.

A particular conceptual model of the motor circuit and its alteration with PD has been of great influence since 1980, although some limitations have been pointed out which have led to modifications. In this model, the basal ganglia normally exert a constant inhibitory influence on a wide range of motor systems, preventing them from becoming active at inappropriate times. When a decision is made to perform a particular action, <a href="Inhibitory%20postsynaptic%20potential">inhibition</a> is reduced for the required motor system, thereby releasing it for activation. Dopamine acts to facilitate this release of inhibition, so high levels of dopamine function tend to promote motor activity, while low levels of dopamine function, such as occur in PD, demand greater exertions of effort for any given movement. Thus, the net effect of dopamine depletion is to produce <a href="hypokinesia">hypokinesia</a>, an overall reduction in motor output. Drugs that are used to treat PD, conversely, may produce excessive dopamine activity, allowing motor systems to be activated at inappropriate times and thereby producing <a href="dyskinesia">dyskinesia</a>s.

There is speculation of several mechanisms by which the brain cells could be lost. One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein <a href="alpha-synuclein">alpha-synuclein</a> bound to <a href="ubiquitin">ubiquitin</a> in the damaged cells. This insoluble <a href="protein">protein</a> accumulates inside neurones forming inclusions called Lewy bodies. According to the <a href="Braak%20staging">Braak staging</a>, a classification of the disease based on pathological findings proposed by <a href="Heiko%20Braak">Heiko Braak</a>, Lewy bodies first appear in the <a href="olfactory%20bulb">olfactory bulb</a>, <a href="medulla%20oblongata">medulla oblongata</a> and <a href="pontine%20tegmentum">pontine tegmentum</a>; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or may have early non-motor symptoms (such as loss of sense of smell, or some sleep or automatic dysfunction). As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the <a href="midbrain">midbrain</a> and basal <a href="forebrain">forebrain</a> and, finally, the <a href="neocortex">neocortex</a>. These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD; however, Lewy bodies may not cause cell death and they may be protective (with the abnormal protein sequestered or walled off). Other forms of alpha-synuclein (e.g., <a href="oligomer">oligomer</a>s) that are not aggregated in Lewy bodies and <a href="Lewy%20body">Lewy neurites</a> may actually be the toxic forms of the protein. In people with dementia, a generalized presence of Lewy bodies is common in cortical areas. <a href="Neurofibrillary%20tangle">Neurofibrillary tangle</a>s and <a href="senile%20plaques">senile plaques</a>, characteristic of <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>, are not common unless the person is demented.

Other cell-death mechanisms include <a href="Proteasome">proteasomal</a> and <a href="Lysosome">lysosomal</a> system dysfunction and reduced <a href="Mitochondrion">mitochondrial</a> activity. Iron accumulation in the substantia nigra is typically observed in conjunction with the protein inclusions. It may be related to <a href="oxidative%20stress">oxidative stress</a>, <a href="protein%20aggregation">protein aggregation</a> and neuronal death, but the mechanisms are not fully understood.

A physician will initially assess for Parkinson's disease with a careful <a href="medical%20history">medical history</a> and <a href="neurological%20examination">neurological examination</a>. People may be given levodopa, with any resulting improvement in motor impairment helping to confirm the PD diagnosis. The finding of Lewy bodies in the midbrain on <a href="autopsy">autopsy</a> is usually considered final proof that the person had PD. The clinical course of the illness over time may reveal it is not Parkinson's disease, requiring that the clinical presentation be periodically reviewed to confirm accuracy of the diagnosis.

Other causes that can secondarily produce parkinsonism are <a href="stroke">stroke</a> and drugs. <a href="Parkinson%20plus%20syndrome">Parkinson plus syndrome</a>s such as <a href="progressive%20supranuclear%20palsy">progressive supranuclear palsy</a> and <a href="multiple%20system%20atrophy">multiple system atrophy</a> must be <a href="Differential%20diagnosis">ruled out</a>. Anti-Parkinson's medications are typically less effective at controlling symptoms in Parkinson plus syndromes. Faster progression rates, early cognitive dysfunction or postural instability, minimal tremor or symmetry at onset may indicate a Parkinson plus disease rather than PD itself. Genetic forms with an autosomal <a href="Dominance%20%28genetics%29">dominant</a> or <a href="Dominance%20%28genetics%29">recessive</a> pattern of inheritance are sometimes referred to as familial Parkinson's disease or familial parkinsonism.

Medical organizations have created <a href="Medical%20diagnosis%23Diagnostic%20criteria">diagnostic criteria</a> to ease and standardize the diagnostic process, especially in the early stages of the disease. The most widely known criteria come from the UK Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Disorders and the U.S. <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Neurological%20Disorders%20and%20Stroke">National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</a>. The Queen Square Brain Bank criteria require slowness of movement (bradykinesia) plus either rigidity, resting tremor, or postural instability. Other possible causes of these symptoms need to be ruled out. Finally, three or more of the following supportive features are required during onset or evolution: unilateral onset, tremor at rest, progression in time, asymmetry of motor symptoms, response to levodopa for at least five years, clinical course of at least ten years and appearance of <a href="dyskinesia">dyskinesia</a>s induced by the intake of excessive levodopa.

When PD diagnoses are checked by autopsy, movement disorders experts are found on average to be 79.6% accurate at initial assessment and 83.9% accurate after they have refined their diagnosis at a follow-up examination. When clinical diagnoses performed mainly by nonexperts are checked by autopsy, average accuracy is 73.8%. Overall, 80.6% of PD diagnoses are accurate, and 82.7% of diagnoses using the Brain Bank criteria are accurate.

A task force of the <a href="The%20Movement%20Disorder%20Society">International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society</a> (MDS) has proposed diagnostic criteria for Parkinson’s disease as well as research criteria for the diagnosis of <a href="Prodrome">prodromal</a> disease, but these will require validation against the more established criteria.

<a href="CT%20scan">Computed tomography</a> (CT) scans of people with PD usually appear normal. <a href="Magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">MRI</a> has become more accurate in diagnosis of the disease over time, specifically through iron-sensitive <a href="Relaxation%20%28NMR%29%23T2%2A%20and%20magnetic%20field%20inhomogeneity">T2*</a> and <a href="susceptibility%20weighted%20imaging">SWI</a> sequences at a magnetic field strength of at least 3T, both of which can demonstrate absence of the characteristic 'swallow tail' imaging pattern in the <a href="dorsolateral">dorsolateral</a> <a href="substantia%20nigra">substantia nigra</a>. In a meta-analysis, absence of this pattern was highly <a href="Sensitivity%20and%20specificity%23Sensitivity">sensitive</a> and <a href="Sensitivity%20and%20specificity%23Specificity">specific</a> for the disease. <a href="Diffusion%20MRI">Diffusion MRI</a> has shown potential in distinguishing between PD and Parkinson plus syndromes, though its diagnostic value is still under investigation. CT and MRI are also used to rule out other diseases that can be secondary causes of parkinsonism, most commonly <a href="encephalitis">encephalitis</a> and <a href="stroke">chronic ischemic insults</a>, as well as less frequent entities such as basal ganglia <a href="Neoplasm">tumors</a> and <a href="hydrocephalus">hydrocephalus</a>.

Dopamine-related activity in the basal ganglia can be directly measured with <a href="Positron%20emission%20tomography">PET</a> and <a href="Single-photon%20emission%20computed%20tomography">SPECT</a> scans, the proprietary name of which is commonly referred to as a <a href="DaTSCAN">DaTSCAN</a>. These studies have shown high agreement with clinical diagnoses of Parkinson's. Reduced dopamine-related activity in the basal ganglia can help exclude drug-induced Parkinsonism. This finding is not entirely specific, however, as reduced dopamine-related activity at the basal ganglia is seen in both PD and the Parkinson-plus disorders.

Other conditions that can have similar presentations to PD include:

Exercise in middle age may reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease later in life. <a href="Caffeine">Caffeine</a> also appears protective with a greater decrease in risk occurring with a larger intake of caffeinated beverages such as coffee. People who smoke cigarettes or use <a href="smokeless%20tobacco">smokeless tobacco</a> are less likely than non-smokers to develop PD, and the more they have used tobacco, the less likely they are to develop PD. It is not known what underlies this effect. Tobacco use may actually protect against PD, or it may be that an unknown factor both increases the risk of PD and causes an aversion to tobacco or makes it easier to quit using tobacco.

<a href="Antioxidant">Antioxidant</a>s, such as <a href="Vitamin%20C">vitamins C</a> and <a href="Vitamin%20E">E</a>, have been proposed to protect against the disease, but results of studies have been contradictory and no positive effect has been proven. The results regarding fat and <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s have been contradictory, with various studies reporting protective effects, risk-increasing effects or no effects. There have been preliminary indications that the use of <a href="Nonsteroidal%20anti-inflammatory%20drug">anti-inflammatory</a> drugs and <a href="calcium%20channel%20blocker">calcium channel blocker</a>s may be protective. A 2010 <a href="meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a> found that <a href="nonsteroidal%20anti-inflammatory%20drug">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</a>s (apart from <a href="aspirin">aspirin</a>), have been associated with at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction of incidence of the development of Parkinson's disease.

There is no cure for Parkinson's disease, but medications, surgery, and <a href="Physical%20therapy">physical treatment</a> can provide relief and are much more effective than treatments available for other neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s disease, <a href="motor%20neuron%20disease">motor neuron disease</a>, and <a href="Parkinson%20plus%20syndrome">Parkinson plus syndrome</a>s. The main families of drugs useful for treating motor symptoms are <a href="L-DOPA">levodopa</a> (always combined with a <a href="Aromatic%20L-amino%20acid%20decarboxylase%20inhibitor">dopa decarboxylase inhibitor</a> and sometimes also with a <a href="COMT%20inhibitor">COMT inhibitor</a>), <a href="dopamine%20agonist">dopamine agonist</a>s and <a href="Monoamine%20oxidase%20inhibitor">MAO-B inhibitors</a>. The stage of the disease and the age at disease onset determine which group is most useful.

<a href="Braak%20staging">Braak staging</a> of Parkinson's disease gives six stages, that can be used to identify early stages, later stages, and late stages. The initial stage in which some disability has already developed and requires pharmacological treatment is followed by later stages associated with the development of complications related to levodopa usage, and a third stage when symptoms unrelated to dopamine deficiency or levodopa treatment may predominate.

Treatment in the first stage aims for an optimal <a href="trade-off">trade-off</a> between symptom control and treatment side-effects. The start of levodopa treatment may be postponed by initially using other medications such as MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists instead, in the hope of delaying the onset of complications due to levodopa use. However, levodopa is still the most effective treatment for the motor symptoms of PD and should not be delayed in patients when their quality of life is impaired. Levodopa-related dyskinesias correlate more strongly with duration and severity of the disease than duration of levodopa treatment, so delaying this therapy may not provide much longer dyskinesia-free time than early use.

In later stages the aim is to reduce PD symptoms while controlling fluctuations in the effect of the medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or its overuse have to be managed. When oral medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery, <a href="deep%20brain%20stimulation">deep brain stimulation</a>, subcutaneous waking day <a href="apomorphine">apomorphine</a> infusion and <a href="enteral%20administration">enteral</a> dopa pumps can be of use.Late stage PD presents many challenges requiring a variety of treatments including those for psychiatric symptoms particularly <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a>, <a href="orthostatic%20hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</a>, bladder dysfunction and <a href="erectile%20dysfunction">erectile dysfunction</a>. In the final stages of the disease, <a href="palliative%20care">palliative care</a> is provided to improve quality of life.

The motor symptoms of PD are the result of reduced dopamine production in the brain's basal ganglia. Dopamine does not cross the <a href="blood-brain%20barrier">blood-brain barrier</a>, so it cannot be taken as a medicine to boost the brain's depleted levels of dopamine. However a <a href="Precursor%20%28chemistry%29">precursor</a> of dopamine, levodopa, can pass through to the brain where it is readily converted to dopamine, and administration of levodopa temporarily diminishes the motor symptoms of PD. Levodopa has been the most widely used PD treatment for over 40 years.

Only 5–10% of levodopa crosses the blood–brain barrier. Much of the remainder is metabolized to dopamine elsewhere in the body, causing a variety of side effects including <a href="nausea">nausea</a>, vomiting and <a href="orthostatic%20hypotension">orthostatic hypotension</a>. <a href="Carbidopa">Carbidopa</a> and <a href="benserazide">benserazide</a> are <a href="Aromatic%20L-amino%20acid%20decarboxylase%20inhibitor">dopa decarboxylase inhibitors</a> which do not cross the blood-brain barrier and inhibit the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, reducing side effects and improving the availability of levodopa for passage into the brain. One of these drugs is usually taken along with levodopa, often combined with levodopa in the same pill.

Levodopa-use leads in the long term to the development of complications: involuntary movements called <a href="dyskinesia">dyskinesia</a>s, and fluctuations in the effectiveness of the medication. When fluctuations occur, a person can cycle through phases with good response to medication and reduced PD symptoms ("on" state), and phases with poor response to medication and significant PD symptoms ("off" state). Using lower doses of levodopa may reduce the risk and severity of these levodopa-induced complications. A former strategy to reduce levodopa-related dyskinesia and fluctuations was to withdraw levodopa medication for some time. This is now discouraged since it can bring on dangerous side effects such as <a href="neuroleptic%20malignant%20syndrome">neuroleptic malignant syndrome</a>. Most people with PD will eventually need levodopa and will later develop levodopa-induced fluctuations and dyskinesias.

There are <a href="Modified-release%20dosage%20%28medicine%29">controlled-release</a> versions of levodopa. Older controlled-release levodopa preparations have poor and unreliable <a href="Absorption%20%28pharmacokinetics%29">absorption</a> and <a href="bioavailability">bioavailability</a> and have not demonstrated improved control of PD motor symptoms or a reduction in levodopa-related complications when compared to immediate release preparations. A newer extended-release levodopa preparation does seem to be more effective in reducing fluctuations but in many patients problems persist. Intestinal infusions of levodopa (Duodopa) can result in striking improvements in fluctuations compared to oral levodopa when the fluctuations are due to insufficient uptake caused by <a href="gastroparesis">gastroparesis</a>. Other oral, longer acting formulations are under study and other modes of delivery (inhaled, transdermal) are being developed.

<a href="Tolcapone">Tolcapone</a> inhibits the activity <a href="Catechol-O-methyl%20transferase">COMT</a>, an enzyme which degrades dopamine. It has been used to complement levodopa; however, its usefulness is limited by possible complications such as liver damage. A similarly effective drug, <a href="entacapone">entacapone</a>, has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function. Licensed preparations of entacapone contain entacapone alone or in combination with carbidopa and levodopa.

Several <a href="dopamine%20agonist">dopamine agonist</a>s that bind to dopamine receptors in the brain have similar effects to levodopa. These were initially used as a complementary therapy to levodopa for individuals experiencing levodopa complications (on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias); they are now mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD with the aim of delaying the initiation of levodopa therapy and so delaying the onset of levodopa's complications. Dopamine agonists include <a href="bromocriptine">bromocriptine</a>, <a href="pergolide">pergolide</a>, <a href="pramipexole">pramipexole</a>, <a href="ropinirole">ropinirole</a>, <a href="piribedil">piribedil</a>, <a href="cabergoline">cabergoline</a>, <a href="apomorphine">apomorphine</a> and <a href="lisuride">lisuride</a>.

Though dopamine agonists are less effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms, they are usually effective enough to manage these symptoms in the first years of treatment. Dyskinesias due to dopamine agonists are rare in younger people who have PD but, along with other complications, become more common with older age at onset. Thus dopamine agonists are the preferred initial treatment for younger onset PD, and levodopa is preferred for older onset PD.

Dopamine agonists produce significant, although usually mild, side effects including <a href="somnolence">drowsiness</a>, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear even at a minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician to search for a different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. They tend to be more expensive than levodopa.

<a href="Apomorphine">Apomorphine</a>, a non-orally administered dopamine agonist, may be used to reduce off periods and dyskinesia in late PD. It is administered by intermittent injections or continuous <a href="Hypodermoclysis">subcutaneous infusions</a>. Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are common, individuals receiving apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored. Two dopamine agonists that are administered through skin patches (<a href="lisuride">lisuride</a> and <a href="rotigotine">rotigotine</a>) and are useful for people in the initial stages and possibly to control off states in those in the advanced state.

<a href="Monoamine%20oxidase%20inhibitor">MAO-B inhibitors</a> (<a href="safinamide">safinamide</a>, <a href="selegiline">selegiline</a> and <a href="rasagiline">rasagiline</a>) increase the amount of dopamine in the basal ganglia by inhibiting the activity of <a href="monoamine%20oxidase%20B">monoamine oxidase B</a> (MAO-B), an enzyme which breaks down dopamine. Like dopamine agonists, their use may delay the commencement of levodopa therapy in early disease, but MAO-B inhibitors produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms. There are few studies of their effectiveness in the advanced stage, although results suggest that they are useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods. An initial study indicated that selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, but this was later disproven.

Other drugs such as <a href="amantadine">amantadine</a> and <a href="anticholinergic">anticholinergic</a>s may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms. However, the evidence supporting them lacks quality, so they are not first choice treatments. In addition to motor symptoms, PD is accompanied by a diverse range of symptoms. A number of drugs have been used to treat some of these problems. Examples are the use of <a href="quetiapine">quetiapine</a> for psychosis, <a href="Acetylcholinesterase%20inhibitor">cholinesterase inhibitors</a> for dementia, and <a href="modafinil">modafinil</a> for <a href="excessive%20daytime%20sleepiness">daytime sleepiness</a>. In 2016 <a href="pimavanserin">pimavanserin</a> was approved for the management of Parkinson's disease psychosis.

Doxepin and rasagline may reduce physical fatigue in PD.

Treating motor symptoms with surgery was once a common practice, but since the discovery of levodopa, the number of operations has declined. Studies in the past few decades have led to great improvements in surgical techniques, so that surgery is again being used in people with advanced PD for whom drug therapy is no longer sufficient. Surgery for PD can be divided in two main groups: lesional and <a href="deep%20brain%20stimulation">deep brain stimulation</a> (DBS). Target areas for DBS or lesions include the <a href="thalamus">thalamus</a>, the <a href="globus%20pallidus">globus pallidus</a> or the <a href="subthalamic%20nucleus">subthalamic nucleus</a>. Deep brain stimulation is the most commonly used surgical treatment, developed in the 1980s by <a href="Alim%20Louis%20Benabid">Alim Louis Benabid</a> and others. It involves the implantation of a medical device called a <a href="Neurostimulation">neurostimulator</a>, which sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain. DBS is recommended for people who have PD with motor fluctuations and tremor inadequately controlled by medication, or to those who are intolerant to medication, as long as they do not have severe <a href="wikt%3Aneuropsychiatric">neuropsychiatric</a> problems. Other, less common, surgical therapies involve intentional formation of lesions to suppress overactivity of specific <a href="wikt%3Asubcortical">subcortical</a> areas. For example, <a href="pallidotomy">pallidotomy</a> involves surgical destruction of the globus pallidus to control dyskinesia.

Fours areas of the brain have been treated with neural stimulators in PD. These are the <a href="globus%20pallidus%20interna">globus pallidus interna</a>, <a href="thalamus">thalamus</a>, <a href="subthalamic%20nucleus">subthalamic nucleus</a> and the <a href="pedunculopontine%20nucleus">pedunculopontine nucleus</a>. DBS of the globus pallidus interna improves motor function while DBS of the thalamic DBS improves tremor but has little effect on bradykinesia or rigidity. DBS of the subthalamic nucleus is usually avoided if a history of depression or neurocognitive impairment is present. DBS of the subthalamic nucleus is associated with reduction in medication. Pedunculopontine nucleus DBS remains experimental at present. Generally DBS is associated with 30–60% improvement in motor score evaluations.

Exercise programs are recommended in people with Parkinson's disease. There is some evidence that speech or mobility problems can improve with rehabilitation, although studies are scarce and of low quality. Regular <a href="physical%20exercise">physical exercise</a> with or without <a href="physical%20therapy">physical therapy</a> can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility, flexibility, strength, gait speed, and quality of life. When an exercise program is performed under the supervision of a physiotherapist, there are more improvements in motor symptoms, mental and emotional functions, daily living activities, and quality of life compared to a self-supervised exercise program at home. In terms of improving flexibility and range of motion for people experiencing <a href="Hypokinesia">rigidity</a>, generalized relaxation techniques such as gentle rocking have been found to decrease excessive muscle tension. Other effective techniques to promote relaxation include slow rotational movements of the extremities and trunk, rhythmic initiation, <a href="diaphragmatic%20breathing">diaphragmatic breathing</a>, and <a href="meditation">meditation</a> techniques. As for gait and addressing the challenges associated with the disease such as <a href="hypokinesia">hypokinesia</a> (slowness of movement), shuffling and decreased arm swing; physiotherapists have a variety of strategies to improve functional mobility and safety. Areas of interest with respect to gait during rehabilitation programs focus on, but are not limited to improving gait speed, the base of support, stride length, trunk and arm swing movement. Strategies include utilizing assistive equipment (pole walking and treadmill walking), verbal cueing (manual, visual and auditory), exercises (marching and PNF patterns) and altering environments (surfaces, inputs, open vs. closed). Strengthening exercises have shown improvements in strength and motor function for people with primary muscular weakness and weakness related to inactivity with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease. However, reports show a significant interaction between strength and the time the medications was taken. Therefore, it is recommended that people with PD should perform exercises 45 minutes to one hour after medications when they are at their best. Also, due to the forward flexed posture, and respiratory dysfunctions in advanced Parkinson's disease, deep diaphragmatic breathing exercises are beneficial in improving chest wall mobility and vital capacity. Exercise may improve constipation. It is unclear if exercise reduces physical fatigue in PD.

One of the most widely practiced <a href="Speech%20therapy">treatments for speech</a> disorders associated with Parkinson's disease is the <a href="Lee%20Silverman%20voice%20treatment">Lee Silverman voice treatment</a> (LSVT). Speech therapy and specifically LSVT may improve speech. <a href="Occupational%20therapy">Occupational therapy</a> (OT) aims to promote health and quality of life by helping people with the disease to participate in as many of their <a href="Daily%20living%20skills">daily living activities</a> as possible. There have been few studies on the effectiveness of OT and their quality is poor, although there is some indication that it may improve motor skills and quality of life for the duration of the therapy.

<a href="Palliative%20care">Palliative care</a> is specialized medical care for people with serious illnesses, including Parkinson's. The goal of this speciality is to improve quality of life for both the person with Parkinson's and the family by providing relief from the symptoms, pain, and stress of illnesses. As Parkinson's is not a curable disease, all treatments are focused on slowing decline and improving quality of life, and are therefore palliative in nature.

Palliative care should be involved earlier, rather than later in the disease course. Palliative care specialists can help with physical symptoms, emotional factors such as loss of function and jobs, depression, fear, and existential concerns.

Along with offering emotional support to both the patient and family, palliative care serves an important role in addressing goals of care. People with Parkinson's may have many difficult decisions to make as the disease progresses such as wishes for <a href="feeding%20tube">feeding tube</a>, <a href="non-invasive%20ventilation">non-invasive ventilator</a>, and <a href="Tracheotomy">tracheostomy</a>; wishes for or against <a href="cardiopulmonary%20resuscitation">cardiopulmonary resuscitation</a>; and when to use <a href="hospice">hospice</a> care. Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make the best decision based on their own values.

Muscles and nerves that control the digestive process may be affected by PD, resulting in <a href="constipation">constipation</a> and <a href="gastroparesis">gastroparesis</a> (food remaining in the stomach for a longer period than normal). A balanced diet, based on periodical nutritional assessments, is recommended and should be designed to avoid weight loss or gain and minimize consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction. As the disease advances, swallowing difficulties (<a href="dysphagia">dysphagia</a>) may appear. In such cases it may be helpful to use <a href="thickening%20agent">thickening agent</a>s for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating, both measures reducing the risk of choking. <a href="Gastrostomy">Gastrostomy</a> to deliver food directly into the stomach is possible in severe cases.

Levodopa and <a href="protein">protein</a>s use the same transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, thereby competing for access. When they are taken together, this results in a reduced effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive <a href="Protein%20%28nutrient%29">protein consumption</a> is discouraged and well balanced <a href="Mediterranean%20diet">Mediterranean diet</a> is recommended. In advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons. To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa should be taken 30 minutes before meals. At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch, allowing protein intake in the evening.

PD invariably progresses with time. A severity rating method known as the <a href="Unified%20Parkinson%27s%20disease%20rating%20scale">Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale</a> (UPDRS) is the most commonly used metric for clinical study. A modified version known as the MDS-UPDRS is also sometimes used. An older scaling method known as the <a href="Hoehn%20and%20Yahr%20scale">Hoehn and Yahr scale</a> (originally published in 1967), and a similar scale known as the Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale, have also been commonly used. The Hoehn and Yahr scale defines five basic stages of progression.

Motor symptoms, if not treated, advance aggressively in the early stages of the disease and more slowly later. Untreated, individuals are expected to lose independent <a href="ambulation">ambulation</a> after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten years. However, it is uncommon to find untreated people nowadays. Medication has improved the prognosis of motor symptoms, while at the same time it is a new source of disability, because of the undesired effects of levodopa after years of use. In people taking levodopa, the progression time of symptoms to a stage of high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years. However, it is hard to predict what course the disease will take for a given individual. Age is the best predictor of disease progression. The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis, while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset.

Since current therapies improve motor symptoms, disability at present is mainly related to non-motor features of the disease. Nevertheless, the relationship between disease progression and disability is not linear. Disability is initially related to motor symptoms. As the disease advances, disability is more related to motor symptoms that do not respond adequately to medication, such as swallowing/speech difficulties, and gait/balance problems; and also to levodopa-induced complications, which appear in up to 50% of individuals after 5 years of levodopa usage. Finally, after ten years most people with the disease have autonomic disturbances, sleep problems, mood alterations and cognitive decline. All of these symptoms, especially cognitive decline, greatly increase disability.

The <a href="life%20expectancy">life expectancy</a> of people with PD is reduced. <a href="Standardized%20mortality%20ratio">Mortality ratios</a> are around twice those of unaffected people. Cognitive decline and dementia, old age at onset, a more advanced disease state and presence of swallowing problems are all mortality <a href="risk%20factor">risk factor</a>s. On the other hand, a disease pattern mainly characterized by tremor as opposed to rigidity predicts an improved survival. Death from <a href="aspiration%20pneumonia">aspiration pneumonia</a> is twice as common in individuals with PD as in the healthy population.

In 2013 PD resulted in about 103,000 deaths globally, up from 44,000 deaths in 1990. The death rate increased from an average of 1.5 to 1.8 per 100,000 during that time.

PD is the second most common <a href="neurodegeneration">neurodegenerative disorder</a> after <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a> and affects approximately seven million people globally and one million people in the United States. The <a href="prevalence">proportion in a population at a given time</a> is about 0.3% in industrialized countries. PD is more common in the elderly and rates rise from 1% in those over 60 years of age to 4% of the population over 80. The mean age of onset is around 60 years, although 5–10% of cases, classified as young onset PD, begin between the ages of 20 and 50. Males are more often affected than females at a ratio of around 3:2. PD may be less prevalent in those of African and Asian ancestry, although this finding is disputed. Some studies have proposed that it is more common in men than women, but others failed to detect any differences between the two sexes. The <a href="incidence%20%28epidemiology%29">number of new cases per year</a> of PD is between 8 and 18 per 100,000 person–years.

Many risk factors and protective factors have been proposed, sometimes in relation to theories concerning possible mechanisms of the disease, however, none have been conclusively related to PD by empirical evidence. When epidemiological studies have been carried out in order to test the relationship between a given factor and PD, they have often been flawed and their results have in some cases been contradictory. The most frequently replicated relationships are an increased risk of PD in those exposed to pesticides, and a reduced risk in smokers. There is a possible link between PD and "<a href="Helicobacter%20pylori">H. pylori</a>" infection that can prevent the absorption of some drugs including levodopa.

Several early sources, including an <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian</a> <a href="papyrus">papyrus</a>, an <a href="ayurveda">Ayurvedic</a> medical treatise, the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>, and <a href="Galen">Galen</a>'s writings, describe symptoms resembling those of PD. After Galen there are no references unambiguously related to PD until the 17th century. In the 17th and 18th centuries, several authors wrote about elements of the disease, including <a href="Franciscus%20Sylvius">Sylvius</a>, <a href="Hieronymus%20David%20Gaubius">Gaubius</a>, <a href="John%20Hunter%20%28surgeon%29">Hunter</a> and <a href="Auguste%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Chomel">Chomel</a>.

In 1817 an English doctor, <a href="James%20Parkinson">James Parkinson</a>, published his essay reporting six cases of paralysis agitans. "An Essay on the Shaking Palsy" described the characteristic resting tremor, abnormal posture and gait, paralysis and diminished muscle strength, and the way that the disease progresses over time. Early neurologists who made further additions to the knowledge of the disease include <a href="Armand%20Trousseau">Trousseau</a>, <a href="William%20Gowers%20%28neurologist%29">Gowers</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Alexander%20Kinnier%20Wilson">Kinnier Wilson</a> and <a href="Wilhelm%20Heinrich%20Erb">Erb</a>, and most notably <a href="Jean-Martin%20Charcot">Jean-Martin Charcot</a>, whose studies between 1868 and 1881 were a landmark in the understanding of the disease. Among other advances, he made the distinction between rigidity, weakness and bradykinesia. He also championed the renaming of the disease in honor of James Parkinson.

In 1912 <a href="Frederic%20Lewy">Frederic Lewy</a> described microscopic particles in affected brains, later named "<a href="Lewy%20body">Lewy bodies</a>". In 1919 <a href="Konstantin%20Tretiakoff">Konstantin Tretiakoff</a> reported that the substantia nigra was the main cerebral structure affected, but this finding was not widely accepted until it was confirmed by further studies published by <a href="Rolf%20Hassler">Rolf Hassler</a> in 1938. The underlying <a href="biochemical">biochemical</a> changes in the <a href="brain">brain</a> were identified in the 1950s, due largely to the work of <a href="Arvid%20Carlsson">Arvid Carlsson</a> on the neurotransmitter dopamine and <a href="Oleh%20Hornykiewicz">Oleh Hornykiewicz</a> on its role on PD. In 1997, alpha-synuclein was found to be the main component of Lewy bodies by <a href="Maria%20Grazia%20Spillantini">Spillantini</a>, <a href="John%20Q.%20Trojanowski">Trojanowski</a>, <a href="Michel%20Goedert">Goedert</a> and others.

Anticholinergics and surgery (lesioning of the <a href="corticospinal%20pathway">corticospinal pathway</a> or some of the basal ganglia structures) were the only treatments until the arrival of levodopa, which reduced their use dramatically. <a href="Levodopa">Levodopa</a> was first synthesized in 1911 by <a href="Casimir%20Funk">Casimir Funk</a>, but it received little attention until the mid 20th century. It entered clinical practice in 1967 and brought about a revolution in the management of PD. By the late 1980s <a href="deep%20brain%20stimulation">deep brain stimulation</a> introduced by <a href="Alim%20Louis%20Benabid">Alim Louis Benabid</a> and colleagues at <a href="Grenoble">Grenoble</a>, France, emerged as a possible treatment.

The costs of PD to society are high, but precise calculations are difficult due to methodological issues in research and differences between countries. The annual cost in the UK is estimated to be between £49 million and £3.3 billion, while the cost per patient per year in the U.S. is probably around $10,000 and the total burden around $23 billion. The largest share of direct cost comes from <a href="inpatient%20care">inpatient care</a> and nursing homes, while the share coming from medication is substantially lower. Indirect costs are high, due to reduced productivity and the burden on caregivers. In addition to economic costs, PD reduces <a href="quality%20of%20life">quality of life</a> of those with the disease and their caregivers.

11 April, the birthday of James Parkinson, has been designated as World Parkinson's Day. A red tulip was chosen by international organizations as the symbol of the disease in 2005: it represents the James Parkinson Tulip <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>, registered in 1981 by a Dutch horticulturalist. Advocacy organizations include the <a href="National%20Parkinson%20Foundation">National Parkinson Foundation</a>, which has provided more than $180 million in care, research and support services since 1982, <a href="Parkinson%27s%20Disease%20Foundation">Parkinson's Disease Foundation</a>, which has distributed more than $115 million for research and nearly $50 million for education and advocacy programs since its founding in 1957 by William Black; the <a href="American%20Parkinson%20Disease%20Association">American Parkinson Disease Association</a>, founded in 1961; and the <a href="European%20Parkinson%27s%20Disease%20Association">European Parkinson's Disease Association</a>, founded in 1992.

Actor <a href="Michael%20J.%20Fox">Michael J. Fox</a> has PD and has greatly increased the public awareness of the disease. After diagnosis, Fox embraced his Parkinson's in television roles, sometimes acting without medication, in order to further illustrate the effects of the condition. He has written two autobiographies in which his fight against the disease plays a major role, and appeared before the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> without medication to illustrate the effects of the disease. <a href="The%20Michael%20J.%20Fox%20Foundation">The Michael J. Fox Foundation</a> aims to develop a cure for Parkinson's disease. Fox received an <a href="Honorary%20degree">honorary doctorate</a> in medicine from <a href="Karolinska%20Institutet">Karolinska Institutet</a> for his contributions to research in Parkinson's disease.

Professional cyclist and Olympic medalist <a href="Davis%20Phinney">Davis Phinney</a>, who was diagnosed with young onset Parkinson's at age 40, started the <a href="Davis%20Phinney%20Foundation">Davis Phinney Foundation</a> in 2004 to support Parkinson's research, focusing on quality of life for people with the disease.

Boxer <a href="Muhammad%20Ali">Muhammad Ali</a> showed signs of Parkinson's when he was 38, but was not diagnosed until he was 42, and has been called the "world's most famous Parkinson's patient". Whether he had PD or <a href="Dementia%20pugilistica">parkinsonism related to boxing</a> is unresolved.

There is little prospect of significant new PD treatments in the near future. Currently active research directions include the search for new <a href="animal%20model">animal model</a>s of the disease and studies of the potential usefulness of <a href="gene%20therapy">gene therapy</a>, <a href="stem%20cell">stem cell</a> transplants and <a href="neuroprotective">neuroprotective</a> agents.

PD is not known to occur naturally in any species other than humans, although animal models which show some features of the disease are used in research. The appearance of parkinsonism in a group of drug addicts in the early 1980s who consumed a contaminated batch of the synthetic <a href="opiate">opiate</a> <a href="Desmethylprodine">MPPP</a> led to the discovery of the chemical <a href="MPTP">MPTP</a> as an agent that causes parkinsonism in non-human primates as well as in humans. Other predominant toxin-based models employ the insecticide <a href="rotenone">rotenone</a>, the herbicide paraquat and the fungicide <a href="maneb">maneb</a>. Models based on toxins are most commonly used in <a href="primate">primate</a>s. <a href="Transgene">Transgenic</a> rodent models that replicate various aspects of PD have been developed. The use of <a href="neurotoxin">neurotoxin</a> <a href="oxidopamine">6-hydroxydopamine</a>, creates a model of Parkinson's disease in rats by targeting and destroying dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway when injected into the substantia nigra.

Gene therapy typically involves the use of a non-infectious <a href="virus">virus</a> (i.e., a <a href="viral%20vector">viral vector</a> such as the <a href="adeno-associated%20virus">adeno-associated virus</a>) to shuttle genetic material into a part of the brain. The gene used leads to the production of an <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> that helps to manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from further damage. In 2010 there were four clinical trials using gene therapy in PD. There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of gene therapy is still unknown. One of these reported positive results in 2011, but the company filed for bankruptcy in March 2012.

Investigations on <a href="neuroprotection">neuroprotection</a> are at the forefront of PD research. Several molecules have been proposed as potential treatments. However, none of them have been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration. Agents currently under investigation include, <a href="Glutamic%20acid">antiglutamatergics</a>, <a href="monoamine%20oxidase">monoamine oxidase</a> inhibitors (<a href="selegiline">selegiline</a>, <a href="rasagiline">rasagiline</a>), <a href="Mitochondrion">promitochondrials</a> (<a href="coenzyme%20Q10">coenzyme Q10</a>, <a href="creatine">creatine</a>), <a href="calcium%20channel%20blocker">calcium channel blocker</a>s (<a href="isradipine">isradipine</a>) and <a href="growth%20factor">growth factor</a>s (<a href="Glial%20cell%20line-derived%20neurotrophic%20factor">GDNF</a>). Preclinical research also targets <a href="alpha-synuclein">alpha-synuclein</a>. A <a href="vaccine">vaccine</a> that primes the human immune system to destroy <a href="alpha-synuclein">alpha-synuclein</a>, PD01A (developed by Austrian company, Affiris), has entered clinical trials in humans. In 2018 another vaccine, PRX002/RG7935, has passed stage I trials and has been supported for stage II trials.

Since early in the 1980s, <a href="fetus">fetal</a>, <a href="pig">porcine</a>, <a href="Common%20carotid%20artery">carotid</a> or <a href="retina">retina</a>l tissues have been used in <a href="Cell-based%20therapies%20for%20Parkinson%27s%20disease">cell transplants</a>, in which dissociated cells are injected into the substantia nigra in the hope that they will incorporate themselves into the brain in a way that replaces the dopamine-producing cells that have been lost. Although there was initial evidence of <a href="Mesencephalon">mesencephalic</a> dopamine-producing cell transplants being beneficial, <a href="Double-blind%23Double-blind%20trials">double-blind trials</a> to date indicate that cell transplants produce no long-term benefit. An additional significant problem was the excess release of dopamine by the transplanted tissue, leading to <a href="dystonia">dystonia</a>s. <a href="Stem%20cell">Stem cell</a> transplants are a recent research target, because stem cells are easy to manipulate and stem cells transplanted into the brains of rodents and monkeys have been found to survive and reduce behavioral abnormalities. Nevertheless, use of fetal stem cells is <a href="Stem%20cell%20controversy">controversial</a>. It has been proposed that effective treatments may be developed in a less controversial way by use of <a href="induced%20pluripotent%20stem%20cell">induced pluripotent stem cell</a>s taken from adults.

<a href="Repetitive%20transcranial%20magnetic%20stimulation">Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation</a> temporarily improves levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Its usefulness in PD is an open research topic. Several <a href="nutrient">nutrient</a>s have been proposed as possible treatments; however there is no evidence that <a href="vitamin">vitamin</a>s or <a href="food%20additive">food additive</a>s improve symptoms. There is no evidence to substantiate that <a href="acupuncture">acupuncture</a> and practice of <a href="Qigong">Qigong</a>, or <a href="T%27ai%20chi%20ch%27uan">T'ai chi</a>, have any effect on the course of the disease or symptoms. <a href="Fava%20bean">Fava bean</a>s and <a href="Mucuna%20pruriens">velvet beans</a> are natural sources of levodopa and are eaten by many people with PD; their intake is not free of risks as life-threatening adverse reactions have been described, such as the <a href="neuroleptic%20malignant%20syndrome">neuroleptic malignant syndrome</a>.

The role of the <a href="gut%E2%80%93brain%20axis">gut–brain axis</a> and the <a href="gut%20flora">gut flora</a> in Parkinsons became a topic of study in the 2010s, starting with work in germ-free transgenic mice, in which <a href="fecal%20transplant">fecal transplant</a>s from people with PD had worse outcomes. Some studies in humans have shown a correlation between patterns of <a href="dysbiosis">dysbiosis</a> in the gut flora in the people with PD, and these patterns, along with a measure of severity of constipation, could diagnose PD with a 90% specificity but only a 67% sensitivity. As of 2017 some scientists hypothesized that changes in the gut flora might be an early site of PD pathology, or might be part of the pathology.

Aleeta curvicosta

Aleeta curvicosta (commonly known as the floury baker or floury miller, known until 2003 as Abricta curvicosta) is a species of <a href="cicada">cicada</a>, one of Australia's most familiar insects. Native to the continent's eastern coastline, it was described in 1834 by <a href="Ernst%20Friedrich%20Germar">Ernst Friedrich Germar</a>. the floury baker is the only <a href="Species%20description">described</a> species in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Aleeta".

The floury baker's distinctive appearance and loud call make it popular with children. Both the <a href="common%20name">common</a> and genus name are derived from the white, flour-like filaments covering the adult body. Its body and eyes are generally brown with pale patterns including a light-coloured line along the midline of the <a href="Prothorax">pronotum</a>. Its forewings have distinctive dark brown patches at the base of two of their <a href="Glossary%20of%20entomology%20terms%23apex">apical cells</a>. The female is larger than the male, although species size overall varies geographically, with larger animals associated with regions of higher rainfall. The male has distinctive genitalia and a loud and complex call generated by the frequent buckling of ribbed <a href="tymbal">tymbal</a>s and amplified by abdominal air sacs.

The floury baker is solitary and occurs in low densities. Individuals typically emerge from the soil through a three-month period from late November to late February, and can be encountered until May. The floury baker is found on a wide variety of trees, with some preference for species of paperbark ("<a href="Melaleuca">Melaleuca</a>"). It is a relatively poor flier, preyed upon by <a href="Exeirus">cicada killer wasps</a> and a wide variety of birds, and can succumb to a cicada-specific fungal disease.

German naturalist <a href="Ernst%20Friedrich%20Germar">Ernst Friedrich Germar</a> <a href="Species%20description">described</a> the floury baker in 1834 as "Cicada curvicosta". Germar based the description on two specimens now in the <a href="Hope%20Entomological%20Collections">Hope Entomological Collections</a>, Oxford, but did not designate a <a href="Type%20%28biology%29">type</a> specimen and their exact locations were not recorded. In 2003, one of the original specimens was designated the <a href="Type%20%28biology%29%23Lectotype">lectotype</a> and the other the <a href="Type%20%28biology%29%23Paralectotype">paralectotype</a>.

Prominent Swedish entomologist <a href="Carl%20St%C3%A5l">Carl Stål</a> named the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Abricta">Abricta</a>" in 1866, and it was either treated as a <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> of the genus "<a href="Tibicen">Tibicen</a>" or a genus in its own right. Thus it became known as "Tibicen curvicostus", and "Abricta curvicosta" from 1906. French entomologist <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Boisduval">Jean Baptiste Boisduval</a> described two specimens collected from <a href="Port%20Jackson">Port Jackson</a> as "Cicada tephrogaster" (later "Tibicen tephrogaster") in 1835; this has long been considered a <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29%23Zoology">junior synonym</a>. However, a review of the genus in 2003 showed "Abricta" to be a disparate group of species, and the Australian members were moved to other genera. <a href="Maxwell%20Sydney%20Moulds">Max Moulds</a> conducted a <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> analysis of the genus and found the cicadas split naturally into <a href="clade">clade</a>s according to <a href="Biogeographical%20region">biogeographical</a> region. Of the 15 Australian species, the floury baker was the earliest offshoot. Unpublished data confirmed it was quite <a href="Genetic%20distance">genetically distant</a> from the other 14 species, and so it was classified in a new <a href="Monotypic%20taxon">monotypic</a> genus "Aleeta", while most of the others were placed in the genus "<a href="Tryella">Tryella</a>". The morphological distinction between "Aleeta" and "Tryella" is based on two factors: "A. curvicosta" has a larger forewing size – rarely less than 3.2 cm (1.3 in) and usually over 4 cm (1.6 in), whereas "Tryella" is never above 3.2 cm (1.3 in); the <a href="uncal%20lobe">uncal lobe</a>s of "Aleeta"'s distinctive male genitalia are downturned at their distal ends, whereas those of "Tryella" are upturned. The name "Aleeta" is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> "aleton" meaning flour or meal.

The floury baker gains its <a href="common%20name">common name</a> from the appearance of having been dusted with flour, and both the vernacular terms baker and miller were in use by 1860. The name is sometimes corrupted as "flowery baker". As of 1905 the same name "floury baker" was also in use for another species of Australian cicada ("Altria perulata", now "<a href="Arunta%20perulata">Arunta perulata</a>"), which has white "sacks" as sounding boxes. That species is now commonly referred to as the "white drummer".

With a body length of , forewings between 3 and 5.1 cm (1.4–2 in) long, a wingspan of 9–10 cm (3.5–4 in) and weighing around , the floury baker is a medium-sized cicada. Individuals markedly vary in size by region depending on local rainfall. Areas with an average annual rainfall of over 1000 mm (40 in) – mostly coastal – have much larger individuals, with average forewing lengths about 1 cm (0.4 in) longer than those in low-rainfall areas.

The adult is brown with a white dusted appearance; white downy filaments cover much of the body, legs and some wing veins, but this silver body fur is easily rubbed off, and so is often substantially diminished in older adults and museum specimens. Individuals have a variety of body markings, but all have a pale midline on their <a href="Prothorax">pronotum</a>. Their legs are brown, sometimes yellowish, but with no distinct markings. Their dry mass is on average 36.2% of their total bodymass, higher than most Australian cicadas, which suggests strong <a href="exoskeleton">exoskeletal</a> armour. Their eyes are dark brown. They have yellowish <a href="operculum%20%28animal%29">opercula</a> that extend laterally well beyond the body. The female is slightly larger than the male, She has generally similar colour and markings, though can be slightly paler in some areas. Her ninth abdominal segment is long and dark reddish-brown, sometimes partly tending toward black. Her <a href="ovipositor">ovipositor</a> is long, with a downward tilt, and the ovipositor sheath is black or dark reddish brown.

The <a href="Insect%20wing">wings</a> are transparent with black or brown veins and a brown-black patch at the base of <a href="Apex%20%28entomology%29%23apex">apical cells</a> 2 and 3. These patches are sometimes fused into a continuous zigzag of dark brown to black discolouration. The basal cell is often opaque and amber-coloured. As on many insects, the wing membranes are coated on either side by a repeating pattern of <a href="Arthropod%20cuticle">cuticular</a> nanostructures, about 200 <a href="Nanometre">nm</a> in height, separated by about 180 nm. These are thought to aid in <a href="anti-reflective%20coating">anti-reflective</a> camouflage, <a href="Wetting%23Non-ideal%20rough%20solid%20surfaces">anti-wetting</a> and <a href="Lotus%20effect">self-cleaning</a>.

The male call can be heard at any time of day and consists of an unusual hissing-type sound, starting as a series of one-second sibilant bursts about a second apart repeated more rapidly until they become a constant hiss lasting 7–10 s. Described as "rp, rp, rp, rp, rrrrrp", the sound is produced when single muscular contractions click the <a href="tymbal">tymbal</a> inward, buckling 7–9 of the tymbal ribs, each of which produces a pulse. This occurs alternately on the two tymbals and is rapidly repeated at a frequency of about 143 <a href="Hertz%20%28unit%29">Hz</a> (in groups of four except when the cicada is in distress – when they are ungrouped and at a lower frequency), giving a pulse repetition frequency of around 1050 per second, with a relatively broad sound frequency range of 7.5–10.5 kHz, that has a dominant frequency (at which the peak energy is observed) of 9.5–9.6 kHz.

The abdominal <a href="Invertebrate%20trachea">tracheal</a> air sacs surround the sound muscles and extend into the abdomen, acting as <a href="Resonator">resonant chambers</a> to amplify sound. The floury baker rapidly extends or raises its abdomen, thus <a href="Modulation">modulating</a> the influence of the air sacs on the sound to change its volume, pitch or tune during the introduction to the free song. This can be heard when a cicada is undisturbed in its natural environment, while male cicadas use these calls to attract females. The species is one of Australia's loudest cicadas and has been termed "the best musician of them all".

The floury baker is distinguished from a similar undescribed species "A." sp. nr "curvicosta" (the little floury baker) by the structure of the male genitalia and an audibly distinct call. Members of "Aleeta" and "Tryella" are easily distinguished from other Australian cicadas as they lack tymbal covers, while the <a href="costal%20margin%20%28entomology%29">costal margin</a> of their forewings gets larger toward the point where the wing is attached to the body. In these genera it is clearly wider than the <a href="costal%20vein">costal vein</a>.

Eggs are laid in a series of slits usually cut by the mother's ovipositor in live branches or twigs of their food plants. On average about sixteen eggs, among a total batch of a few hundred, are laid in each slit. The batch all hatch around 70 days later – usually within a day or two of one another – but take longer in cold or dry conditions. Oviposition has been observed on a wide range of native and <a href="Introduced%20species">introduced</a> plant species and can weaken the branches of young orchard trees such that they cannot sustain the load of their fruit.

After hatching, the nymphs fall from the branches to seek a crack in the soil where they can burrow, often to a depth of 10–40 cm (4–16 in), by digging with their large forelegs. Larger species of cicada like "A. curvicosta" are thought to spend 2–8 years underground, during which time they grow and feed through their <a href="Rostrum%20%28anatomy%29">rostrum</a> on the sap from tree roots. They <a href="Moulting%23Arthropods">moult</a> five times before emerging from the ground to shed their final shell. Although consistently taking place at night, the emergence of the population is diffusely spread over the season in comparison to the more high-density Australian species. The sex ratio is about 1.15 males to every female, consistent throughout the emergence. The <a href="Basal%20metabolic%20rate">metabolic rate</a> over a period of about 6.5 hours during emergence of "A. curvicosta" is about 1.8 times the resting metabolic rate of the adult. A <a href="South%20East%20Queensland">South East Queensland</a> study reported nymphs would emerge on most tree species but avoid Norfolk pine ("<a href="Araucaria%20heterophylla">Araucaria heterophylla</a>") and broad-leaved paperbark ("<a href="Melaleuca%20quinquenervia">Melaleuca quinquenervia</a>"). The adults are usually found between November and May but are sometimes observed as early as September and until as late as June. They were recorded as appearing every year, mainly in December and January in western <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, with a similar 92-day emergence period from late November until late February recorded in South East Queensland. This makes it one of the last Australian cicadas to emerge each season. The nymph grips onto the tree bark with all of its legs, swallows air and redistributes <a href="haemolymph">haemolymph</a> to split the cast down the center of its back. It then extracts its head and <a href="Clypeus%20%28arthropod%20anatomy%29">clypeus</a> by hunching its body, and when these have emerged, arches back to draw the legs out of their casing. It then slowly unfolds its wings, finally bending forward and gripping onto the front of the shell to free its abdomen. Once free it hangs for hours more as the wings harden.

Once they reach adulthood most adult cicada species live for around another two to four weeks. During this time they feed on flowing sap from tree branches, and mating and egg laying occurs.

The floury baker is found from the <a href="Daintree%20River">Daintree River</a> in North Queensland to <a href="Bendalong%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bendalong</a> in southern New South Wales. It is a highland species in the northern part of its range, restricted to the <a href="Atherton%20Tableland">Atherton Tableland</a> and <a href="Eungella%20National%20Park">Eungella National Park</a> to the west of <a href="Mackay%2C%20Queensland">Mackay</a>, but more a lowland species in the remainder of its range. It may be found in varied habitats, from rainforest margins to suburbs, even in the centre of Sydney.

Individuals are usually solitary, with a South-East Queensland study estimating densities of only 50 per hectare (compared to some other Australian species nearly two orders of magnitude more dense). The adult floury baker normally perches facing downwards and on branches of trees rather than trunks. It is found on a wide variety of plants, most commonly on species in the family <a href="Myrtaceae">Myrtaceae</a>, more specifically various species of "<a href="Melaleuca">Melaleuca</a>" and "<a href="Callistemon">Callistemon</a>" plants, as well as brown hazelwood ("<a href="Lysicarpus">Lysicarpus angustifolius</a>") and pegunny ("<a href="Bauhinia%20hookeri">Bauhinia hookeri</a>"). These are expected to also be nymphal food plants. The species was associated with white feather honeymyrtle ("<a href="Melaleuca%20decora">Melaleuca decora</a>") in a study at three sites in western Sydney. The broad-leaved paperbark has been confirmed as a nymphal food plant.

Floury bakers are not proficient fliers compared with other Australian cicadas. They are slow, with a typical speed of , which rises to around (14 km/hr) when they are pursued or provoked. They are only able to generate low aerodynamic power and their flights are relatively short, lasting around 3.4 s, with an average of 3.3 changes in direction. Nor are they adept at landing. The distance at which they react to an approaching observer is moderate, both when stationary and when in flight.

Bird predation of the adult cicada is common, with <a href="Maluridae">wrens</a> and <a href="grey%20fantail">grey fantail</a>s, <a href="noisy%20miner">noisy miner</a>s, <a href="blue-faced%20honeyeater">blue-faced honeyeater</a>s, <a href="little%20wattlebird">little wattlebird</a>s, <a href="grey%20butcherbird">grey</a> and <a href="pied%20butcherbird">pied butcherbird</a>s, <a href="magpie-lark">magpie-lark</a>s, <a href="Torresian%20crow">Torresian crow</a>s, <a href="white-faced%20heron">white-faced heron</a>s and even the nocturnal <a href="tawny%20frogmouth">tawny frogmouth</a>, all reported as significant predators. The frogmouths and <a href="bearded%20dragon">bearded dragon</a>s have been observed feeding on emerging nymphs, however total nymphal mortality is estimated at under 10%.

The adults of some Australian cicada are subject to a cicada-specific fungus from the genus "<a href="Massospora">Massospora</a>", which grows on their genitalia and abdominal cavity, eventually causing the tail end to drop off. Australian cicadas are further preyed on by the <a href="Exeirus">cicada killer wasp</a> ("Exeirus lateritius"), which stings and paralyses cicadas high in the trees. Their victims drop to the ground where the cicada-hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with its hind legs, sometimes over a distance of 100 m (330 ft). They are then shoved into the hunter's burrow, where the helpless cicada is placed on a shelf in an often extensive 'catacomb', to form food-stock for the wasp grub growing from the eggs deposited within.

The shells shed by the nymph, as with those of other cicada species, are often collected by children and sometimes attached to their clothing. Schoolchildren have been known to bring live adults into classrooms to startle the class with their "strident shrieking", typically to the observable displeasure of teachers. Children often climb trees to collect them, and keep them temporarily as pets in shoeboxes. They cannot easily be kept for longer than a day or two, given that they need flowing sap for food. A poem dedicated to the floury baker appeared in the "<a href="Catholic%20Press">Catholic Press</a>" in 1930, describing its life cycle to children.

The surrounding area accommodates 15,511 jobs, constituting one of the Seattle region's major employment centers, as well as 488 residents in <a href="Montlake%2C%20Seattle">Montlake</a> to the south. The station is connected to the Montlake neighborhood by the <a href="Montlake%20Bridge">Montlake Bridge</a>, which carries Montlake Boulevard towards a junction with <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20520">State Route 520</a>, a major east–west freeway connecting Seattle to the <a href="Eastside%20%28King%20County%2C%20Washington%29">Eastside</a> suburbs. The station is south of the <a href="University%20Village%2C%20Seattle">University Village</a> shopping center and southwest of <a href="Seattle%20Children%27s%20Hospital">Seattle Children's Hospital</a>. The University of Washington has long-term plans to redevelop its parking lots along Montlake Boulevard into additional office and classroom space, forming the new "East Campus" area.

The University of Washington moved from its <a href="Metropolitan%20Tract%20%28Seattle%29">downtown campus</a> to the north side of <a href="Portage%20Bay">Portage Bay</a> in 1895, later expanding during the <a href="Alaska%E2%80%93Yukon%E2%80%93Pacific%20Exposition">Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition</a> of 1909 that was hosted at the site. In 1911, urban planner <a href="Virgil%20Bogue">Virgil Bogue</a>'s rejected <a href="comprehensive%20plan">comprehensive plan</a> for Seattle envisioned a citywide <a href="rapid%20transit">subway</a> system, including a line serving the east side of the university campus and connected to <a href="Ravenna%2C%20Seattle">Ravenna</a> and eastern <a href="Capitol%20Hill%2C%20Seattle">Capitol Hill</a>. The <a href="Forward%20Thrust">Forward Thrust</a> Committee's planned regional rapid transit system, which was rejected by voters in 1968 and 1970, included a subway station at the University Hospital near Husky Stadium, from where trains would continue south through Capitol Hill to <a href="Downtown%20Seattle">Downtown Seattle</a>. A 1986 regional transit plan from the <a href="Puget%20Sound%20Council%20of%20Governments">Puget Sound Council of Governments</a> proposed a light rail line through the University District, including a station at the University Hospital, continuing through <a href="Eastlake%2C%20Seattle">Eastlake</a> to Downtown Seattle.

In the 1990s, a regional transit authority—later <a href="Sound%20Transit">Sound Transit</a>—was formed to build a light rail system for the Seattle metropolitan area. The University District was named as a major destination for the system and given two stations at NE Pacific Street and NE 45th Street on the western side of the university campus, which would be connected to Downtown Seattle via a tunnel under Capitol Hill. The $6.7 billion proposal, including a light rail line continuing north from the University District to <a href="Northgate%2C%20Seattle">Northgate</a> and <a href="Lynnwood%2C%20Washington">Lynnwood</a>, was rejected by voters in 1995 and replaced with a smaller plan. In November 1996, voters approved a condensed $3.9-billion regional transit plan that included a shorter light rail line from the University District to Downtown Seattle and <a href="SeaTac%2C%20Washington">SeaTac</a>. A surface alignment through Eastlake was also proposed in the event boring a tunnel through Capitol Hill and under Portage Bay would be too expensive. Sound Transit finalized its preferred alignment for the light rail project, which included stations at NE Pacific Street and NE 45th Street, in 1999.

Sound Transit suspended planning for the Portage Bay tunnel in 2000 after it received construction bids that were $171 million higher than expected, blamed on a competitive labor market and soil testing that indicated that a deeper tunnel was needed. Faced with budget issues and further schedule delays, Sound Transit deferred construction of the segment between Downtown Seattle and the University District in 2001 while re-evaluating alignment options. The alternatives were narrowed to two options in early 2002: a tunnel under the Ship Canal at <a href="University%20Bridge%20%28Seattle%29">University Bridge</a> with a single station at Northeast 45th Street; and a tunnel under the <a href="Montlake%20Cut">Montlake Cut</a> and stations near Husky Stadium and at Northeast 45th Street. A Sound Transit study determined the Montlake route was the most cost-effective, and the University of Washington endorsed it as the least disruptive to its research buildings. In 2004, the Sound Transit Board confirmed this route, including an underground station at Husky Stadium with a subterranean pedestrian connection to the campus, as the new preferred alignment for the Link light rail project. The $1.9 billion "University Link" project, with the Husky Stadium station as the northern terminus, received final approval from Sound Transit and the <a href="Federal%20Transit%20Administration">Federal Transit Administration</a> (FTA) in 2006.

Under the plan approved in 2006, the Husky Stadium station would have three entrances connected via underground walkways or overpasses; on the east side of Montlake Boulevard adjacent to the stadium; on the north side of Pacific Place on the Burke-Gilman Trail; and on the west side of Montlake Boulevard near the University of Washington Medical Center. In 2007, the Seattle Design Commission recommended an overpass to cross Montlake Boulevard in lieu of the underground walkway, and Sound Transit updated the station's design plan accordingly, adding a bridge on the north side of the Montlake Triangle across from Rainier Vista. The University of Washington unveiled its plans to redevelop the Montlake Triangle into a landscaped park with a land bridge over Pacific Place, and requested Sound Transit to connect the station through a mid-block crosswalk instead of the bridge. The FTA rejected the mid-block crosswalk and a compromise pedestrian overpass connecting to the center of the Montlake Triangle from Rainier Vista was adopted in 2011.

The station was named "University of Washington" in 2012, leading to confusion with the existing <a href="University%20Street%20station">University Street station</a> in Downtown Seattle and the future <a href="U%20District%20station">U District station</a> to the west of the campus, scheduled to open in 2021. Other suggested names included "Montlake", "Husky Stadium", and "UW Medical Center".

The University Link project received a $813 million grant from the federal government in January 2009, allowing it to move towards final design and construction. A <a href="groundbreaking">groundbreaking</a> ceremony was held at the future University of Washington station on March 6, 2009, marking the start of construction. Utility relocation and site preparation at the station, consisting of the demolition and replacement of facilities at Husky Stadium—including two ticket offices, a concessions kitchen, and restrooms—had begun in February and continued until August. A new access road around Husky Stadium was built and part of the stadium's parking lot was closed and fenced off in early 2010.

Excavation of the <a href="station%20box">station box</a>, along with <a href="shoring">shoring</a> installation and <a href="jet%20grouting">jet grouting</a> of the soil, began in June 2010. The platform level, at a depth of , was reached in late February 2011, allowing concrete pouring to commence. The project's two <a href="tunnel%20boring%20machine">tunnel boring machine</a>s arrived at University of Washington station for assembly in April 2011, and were dedicated by local and state politicians on May 16. The tunnel boring machines were launched in June and July towards <a href="Capitol%20Hill%20station">Capitol Hill station</a>, arriving in spring 2012. Station box excavation was completed in June 2012, and contractors <a href="Hoffman%20Construction%20Company">Hoffman Construction Company</a> moved on to steel erection and pouring of the station's upper levels.

Station construction reached street level in late 2012, and structural elements of the <a href="headhouse">headhouse</a> and Montlake Boulevard overpass were installed. The station's basic structure was finished in early 2014, and landscaping and road access around the entrance was restored while finishing work continued underground. The station and overpass were declared substantially complete in November 2014, while work above ground continued. The University of Washington completed work on the Montlake Triangle in July 2015, and the Montlake Boulevard overpass opened to the public later that month.

Capitol Hill and University of Washington stations opened on March 19, 2016, during a community celebration that attracted 67,000 people; the two stations opened six months ahead of schedule. The following week, several bus routes in Northeast Seattle were redirected to <a href="feeder%20line%20%28network%29">feed</a> the new station as part of a major restructuring of service brought on by the cancellation of downtown express routes from the University District. By the end of the year, the station was averaging 9,300 daily boardings, placing it second among Link stations for ridership behind Westlake.

The station has had long-term escalator outages that began soon after it was opened, blamed on components failing prematurely. In one incident on March 16, 2018, both of the station's down escalators were broken for three hours, forcing passengers to queue for the elevators. The incident prompted Sound Transit to change their escalator protocol in April, allowing passengers to temporarily use the shut-off escalators as stairs and opening emergency stairways. The downward escalators failed again for an hour on April 27, during which the new escalator protocol was used to allow access to the emergency stairways. In October 2018, Sound Transit approved a $20 million contract to replace the station's 13 escalators, open one set of stairs to the public, and build a connection between the two sub-mezzanines above the platform.

Buses from the Eastside area using State Route 520 are planned to be redirected to the station beginning in 2019, as part of a restructure of downtown bus service before the <a href="Downtown%20Seattle%20Transit%20Tunnel">downtown transit tunnel</a> is closed. A new set of bus stops and bus lanes on the east side of Montlake Boulevard are planned to serve them. University of Washington station will serve as the northern terminus of Central Link until 2021, when an <a href="Northgate%20Link%20extension">extension</a> to <a href="Northgate%20Transit%20Center">Northgate Transit Center</a> is planned to open. Tunnel boring from U District station, located northwest of the university campus, was completed in September 2016.

University of Washington station consists of a single, <a href="island%20platform">island platform</a> located below street level. The station has a stated platform capacity of 1,600 people; it was designed to accommodate large crowds attending Husky Stadium events. The station has a large, open <a href="mezzanine">mezzanine</a> level that is split between two stories and requires a change of escalators. The upper mezzanine contains <a href="ticket%20vending%20machine">ticket vending machine</a>s and passenger information, and is decorated with ceramic tiles and fixtures with green and yellow accents. The colors of the walls drew criticism from fans of the <a href="Washington%20Huskies%20football">Huskies football team</a> because they were similar to the neon yellow that was later adopted by the <a href="Oregon%20Ducks%20football">Oregon Ducks</a>, a rival football team. The entrance is contained in a two-story glass building, the upper level of which leads to a bridge over Montlake Boulevard; the bridge is also connected via a ramp and stairway to street level adjacent to the station. The surface plaza around the station includes 130 bicycle racks under the bridge's ramp, as well as pay parking in nearby lots owned by the university. The station's elevators lead directly from the platform to the surface entrance and pedestrian overpass levels.

The non-public areas of the station include a track <a href="crossover%20%28rail%29">crossover</a>, maintenance spaces, and a smoke ventilation system assisted by two surface vents to the north and south of the complex. University of Washington station was designed by <a href="LMN%20Architects">LMN Architects</a>, a Seattle-based firm that also worked on thirteen other light rail stations on the future <a href="East%20Link%20Extension%20%28Sound%20Transit%29">East Link</a> and <a href="Lynnwood%20Link">Lynnwood Link</a> projects. LMN received several design awards for their work on the station, including an <a href="American%20Institute%20of%20Architects">American Institute of Architects</a> Honor Award for Interior Architecture in 2018, an <a href="International%20Architecture%20Awards">International Architecture Award</a> from the <a href="Chicago%20Athenaeum">Chicago Athenaeum</a>, an Award of Merit from the Seattle chapter of the American Institute of Architects, and an Honorable Mention in the <a href="Fast%20Company%20%28magazine%29">Fast Co.Design</a> Innovation By Design Awards.

One major component of the station's architecture is the chamber-like mezzanine, which contains the station's sole piece of public art; "Subterraneum" by Leo Saul Berk, funded by Sound Transit's system-wide public art program. "Subterraneum" consists of 6,000 backlit LED panels lining the walls of the chamber. Berk took inspiration from the <a href="geologic%20map">geologic map</a>s for the project and symbols representing the <a href="stratum">strata</a> of layers near the station, while adding some original creations. The installation was praised for its scale and evocative staging by <a href="Gary%20Faigin">Gary Faigin</a> of "<a href="The%20Seattle%20Times">The Seattle Times</a>", and dubbed an "underground planetarium" by the "<a href="Huffington%20Post">Huffington Post</a>". The station is represented on maps and signage by a <a href="pictogram">pictogram</a> of a <a href="graduation%20cap">graduation cap</a> with the University of Washington logo. During construction of the station from 2010 to 2014, a temporary piece of art known as the "Great Wall of Us" was installed on the fence surrounding the work site. The wall featured 800 photographs of 1,500 people taken at university events and at <a href="Tukwila%20International%20Boulevard%20station">Tukwila International Boulevard station</a>, interspersed with viewing windows into the work site and explanatory text.

University of Washington station is the northern terminus of Sound Transit's Central Link line, which runs south to Downtown Seattle, the <a href="Rainier%20Valley%2C%20Seattle">Rainier Valley</a>, and <a href="Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma%20International%20Airport">Seattle–Tacoma International Airport</a> toward <a href="Angle%20Lake%20station">Angle Lake station</a>. The station is situated north of Capitol Hill station and connected to downtown by the <a href="University%20Link%20Tunnel">University Link Tunnel</a>. Central Link trains serve University of Washington station twenty hours a day on weekdays and Saturdays, from 5:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m.; and eighteen hours on Sundays, from 6:00 a.m. to midnight. During regular weekday service, trains operate roughly every six to ten minutes during <a href="rush%20hour">rush hour</a> and midday operation, respectively, with longer headways of fifteen minutes in the early morning and twenty minutes at night. During weekends, Central Link trains arrive at University of Washington station every ten minutes during midday hours and every fifteen minutes during mornings and evenings. The station is approximately forty-four minutes from <a href="SeaTac/Airport%20station">SeaTac/Airport station</a> and six minutes from <a href="Westlake%20station%20%28Sound%20Transit%29">Westlake station</a> in Downtown Seattle. In 2017, an average of 9,691 passengers boarded Link trains at University of Washington stations on weekdays; the station is the second busiest on the line, after Westlake.

University of Washington station is also a major bus station, with six bus stops around the Montlake Triangle and nearby streets serving bus routes from Northeast Seattle and the Eastside. <a href="King%20County%20Metro">King County Metro</a> operates eighteen routes that stop at the station, traveling to the University District, <a href="Ballard%2C%20Seattle">Ballard</a>, <a href="Roosevelt%2C%20Seattle">Roosevelt</a>, Northgate, <a href="Green%20Lake%2C%20Seattle">Green Lake</a>, <a href="Lake%20City%2C%20Seattle">Lake City</a>, <a href="Sand%20Point%2C%20Seattle">Sand Point</a>, <a href="Kenmore%2C%20Washington">Kenmore</a>, <a href="Kirkland%2C%20Washington">Kirkland</a>, <a href="Bellevue%2C%20Washington">Bellevue</a>, and <a href="Issaquah%2C%20Washington">Issaquah</a>.

M249 light machine gun

The M249 light machine gun (LMG), formerly designated the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) and formally written as Light Machine Gun, 5.56 mm, M249, is the American adaptation of the Belgian <a href="FN%20Minimi">FN Minimi</a>, a <a href="light%20machine%20gun">light machine gun</a> manufactured by the Belgian company <a href="FN%20Herstal">FN Herstal</a> (FN). The M249 is manufactured in the United States by the local subsidiary FN Manufacturing LLC in <a href="Columbia%2C%20South%20Carolina">Columbia, South Carolina</a> and is widely used in the <a href="United%20States%20Armed%20Forces">U.S. Armed Forces</a>. The weapon was introduced in 1984 after being judged the most effective of a number of candidate weapons to address the lack of <a href="Automatic%20firearm">automatic</a> <a href="firepower">firepower</a> in small units. The M249 provides infantry <a href="squad">squad</a>s with the high <a href="rate%20of%20fire">rate of fire</a> of a <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a> combined with accuracy and portability approaching that of a rifle.

The M249 is <a href="Gas%20operated%20reloading">gas operated</a> and air-cooled. It has a quick-change barrel, allowing the gunner to rapidly replace an overheated or jammed barrel. A folding <a href="bipod">bipod</a> is attached near the front of the gun, though an <a href="M192%20Lightweight%20Ground%20Mount">M192 LGM</a> <a href="tripod%20%28weapon%29">tripod</a> is available. It can be fed from both <a href="Belt%20%28firearm%29">linked ammunition</a> and <a href="STANAG%20magazine">STANAG magazine</a>s, like those used in the <a href="M16%20rifle">M16</a> and <a href="M4%20carbine">M4</a>. This allows the <a href="Squad%20automatic%20weapon">SAW</a> gunner to use rifle magazines as an emergency source of ammunition in the event that he or she runs out of linked rounds.

M249s have seen action in every major conflict involving the United States since the <a href="United%20States%20invasion%20of%20Panama">U.S. invasion of Panama</a> in 1989. Due to the weight and age of the weapon, the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> is fielding the <a href="M27%20Infantry%20Automatic%20Rifle">M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle</a> with plans to partially replace the M249 in Marine Corps service.

The M249 is often referred to as a "Squad Assault Weapon".

In 1965, the <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> and U.S. Marine Corps' primary machine guns were the <a href="M2%20Browning%20machine%20gun">M2 Browning</a> and <a href="M60%20machine%20gun">M60</a>. The M2 was a large-caliber <a href="heavy%20machine%20gun">heavy machine gun</a>, usually mounted on vehicles or in fixed emplacements. The M60 was a more mobile <a href="medium%20machine%20gun">medium machine gun</a> intended to be carried with the troops to provide heavy automatic fire. Both were very heavy weapons and usually required a crew of at least two to operate efficiently. The <a href="M1918%20Browning%20Automatic%20Rifle">Browning automatic rifle</a>, the army's main individual machine gun since its introduction in World War I, was phased out in 1957 with the introduction of the <a href="M14%20rifle">M14 rifle</a>, which had a fully automatic mode. "Designated riflemen" in every squad were ordered to use their weapons on the fully automatic setting, while other troops were required to use their rifle's semi-automatic mode on most occasions to increase accuracy and conserve ammunition. Because the M14 and <a href="M16%20rifle">M16</a> rifles had not been designed with sustained automatic fire in mind, they often overheated or jammed. The 20-round and 30-round magazines of these weapons limited their sustained automatic effectiveness when compared to belt-fed weapons.

The Army decided that an individual machine gun, lighter than the M60, but with more firepower than the M16, would be advantageous; troops would no longer have to rely on rifles for automatic fire. Through the 1960s, the introduction of a machine gun into the infantry squad was examined in various studies. While there was a brief flirtation with the concept of a <a href="flechette">flechette</a>- or dart-firing Universal Machine Gun during one study, most light machine gun experiments concentrated on the <a href="Stoner%2063">Stoner 63</a> light machine gun, a modular weapon that could be easily modified for different purposes. The Stoner 63 LMG saw combat for a brief period in Vietnam with the Marine Corps, and later on a wider scale with the <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20SEALs">U.S. Navy SEALs</a>.

In 1968, the Army Small Arms Program developed plans for a new 5.56 mm caliber LMG, though no funds were allocated (5.56 mm ammunition was viewed as underpowered by many in the armed forces). Studies of improved 5.56 mm ammunition, with better performance characteristics, began. The earliest reference to studies of other caliber cartridges for the LMG did not appear until 1969. In July 1970, the U.S. Army finally approved development of an LMG, with no specified caliber. At this time, the nomenclature "Squad Automatic Weapon" (SAW) was introduced. Actual design of alternative cartridges for the LMG did not begin until July 1971. A month later, <a href="Frankford%20Arsenal">Frankford Arsenal</a> decided on two cartridge designs for the new LMG: a <a href="6%20mm%20SAW">6 mm cartridge</a> and a new 5.56 mm cartridge with a much larger case. Neither design was finalized by March 1972, when the Army published the specifications document for the planned SAW. The 6 mm cartridge design was eventually approved in May that year. Prior to July 1972, SAW development contracts were awarded to Maremont, <a href="Philco%20Ford">Philco Ford</a>, and the Rodman Laboratory at <a href="Rock%20Island%20Arsenal">Rock Island Arsenal</a>. These companies produced designs with Army designations XM233, XM234 and <a href="Rodman%20Laboratories%20XM235">XM235</a> respectively—X denoting "experimental". Designs were required to have a weight of less than 9.07 kg (20 lb) including 200 rounds of ammunition, and a range of at least 800 meters (2,600 ft).

When the time came for developmental and operational testing of the SAW candidates, three 5.56 mm candidate weapons were included with the 6 mm candidates: the <a href="Colt%20Automatic%20Rifle">M16 HBAR</a>, a heavy-barrel variant of the M16 designed for prolonged firing; the <a href="Fabrique%20Nationale%20de%20Herstal">Fabrique Nationale de Herstal</a> (FN) <a href="FN%20Minimi">Minimi</a>; and the <a href="Heckler%20%26amp%3B%20Koch%20HK23">HK 23A1</a>. The initial round of tests ended in December 1974. In February 1976, the Minimi and Rodman XM235 SAW were selected for further development. At this time, opinions of the 6 mm cartridge were beginning to sour due to the logistical implications of providing yet another ammunition type to the infantry. In June, it was requested that the SAW specifications document be revised to emphasize standard 5.56 mm ammunition. In October, the requested revisions were approved, and bids were solicited for the conversion of the Rodman XM235 to 5.56 mm. Production of the converted XM235 was awarded to <a href="Ford%20Aerospace">Ford Aerospace</a>, and its designation was changed to XM248. A new M16 HBAR variant, the XM106, was developed in 1978, and soon after, <a href="Heckler%20%26amp%3B%20Koch">Heckler & Koch</a> lobbied to include a 5.56 mm conversion of its <a href="Heckler%20%26amp%3B%20Koch%20HK23%23HK21A1">HK 21A1</a> (instead of the standard 7.62 mm NATO ammunition it was built for) in future SAW testing. The latter model was designated the XM262. At this time, the Minimi received the designation XM249. Testing of the four candidates resumed in April 1979.

In May 1980, the FN XM249 was selected as the best choice for future development on the grounds of performance and cost, while the HK XM262 reportedly came a close second. In September, FN was awarded a "maturity phase" contract for further development of the XM249, and testing of the new weapon began in June 1981. The official adoption took place in February 1982.

The new gun entered U.S. Army service as the M249 squad automatic weapon in 1984, and was adopted by the U.S. Marine Corps a year later. The U.S. production model has a different butt from that of the regular Minimi. It is manufactured in the FN factory in <a href="Columbia%2C%20South%20Carolina">Columbia, South Carolina</a>.

Although found to be reliable and accurate, the M249 was considered to present unacceptable hazards in the form of an exposed hot barrel and sharp edges. There were complaints that the front sight required special adjustment tools. On August 23, 1985, then-<a href="United%20States%20Under%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Army">U.S. Under Secretary of the Army</a> <a href="James%20R.%20Ambrose">James R. Ambrose</a> suspended M249 production pending the development of the product improvement program (PIP) intended to fix these problems. Congress deleted funds for the M249 from the Fiscal Year 1986 defense budget, then retroactively set aside the program's prior year's funds from the M249 program for other purposes, including retirement and pay raises. Over 1,100 M249s already issued were to remain in use, but be retrofitted with the PIP kit when it became available. Over 7,000 remaining M249s were to stay in storage at depots until corrective changes could be made. The PIP kit was eventually developed and implemented, and production of the M249 resumed. In 1994 the M249 squad automatic weapon was re-designated the M249 light machine gun.

The M249 is a belt-fed light machine gun. It fires the <a href="5.56%C3%9745mm%20NATO">5.56×45mm NATO</a> cartridge, usually a combination of one M856 <a href="Tracer%20ammunition%23Types">tracer</a> and four M855 ball cartridges fed from <a href="M27%20link">M27 linked belts</a>. Belts are typically held in a hard plastic or soft canvas box attached to the underside of the weapon.

It fires from an <a href="open%20bolt">open bolt</a> and is <a href="gas%20operated">gas operated</a>. When the trigger is pulled, the bolt and bolt carrier move forward under the power of the recoil spring. A cartridge is stripped from the belt, chambered, and discharged, sending a bullet down the bore. Expanding propellant gases are diverted through a hole in the barrel into a chamber. This pressure moves a piston providing the energy to extract and eject the spent casing as well as advance the belt and compress the recoil spring, thus preparing for subsequent shots. At long and in weight ( including a 200-round belt and plastic ammo box), the M249 is a cumbersome weapon.

The barrel has a rifling twist rate of one turn in . Because firing heats up the bore, the air-cooled barrel is equipped with a mechanism to remove and replace the barrel assembly with a spare. A folding bipod with adjustable legs is attached near the front of the weapon, though there are provisions for hard-mounting to a <a href="M192%20Lightweight%20Ground%20Mount">M192 Lightweight Ground Mount</a> <a href="tripod%20%28weapon%29">tripod</a> or vehicle mount. The M249 provides accuracy approaching that of a rifle, combined with the sustained volume of fire of a machine gun. Its original gas regulator offered two different gas port sizes, allowing cyclic rates of fire of 725-rounds per minute (r/min) or 1,000 r/min. The latter setting was intended for adverse conditions, such as an excessively dirty firearm or cold weather. The two-position gas regulator was discarded as part of a product improvement program. The sustained <a href="rate%20of%20fire">rate of fire</a>, the rate at which the gunner can fire continuously without overheating, is listed as 50 r/min. It has a cyclic, or maximum, rate of fire of between 650 and 850 r/min.

The M249 LMG entered service in 1984 as the M249 SAW. Initial reactions to the gun were mixed: it fulfilled the light machine gun role well when fired from the ground, but was not as effective when fired from the shoulder or hip. It was praised for its extreme durability and massive firepower, though a number of areas for improvement were highlighted: the blank firing attachment fitted poorly, the bipod was very weak and broke easily, the sling attachment was awkward, and there were many slots and gaps that accumulated dirt. Some claimed that the heavy-barrelled version of the M16 rifle was a more effective light machine gun.

The M249 SAW was not used heavily before the 1991 <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>, though it has been used in every major U.S. conflict since. American personnel in <a href="Unified%20Task%20Force">Somalia</a> in 1993, <a href="Bosnian%20War">Bosnia</a> in 1994, <a href="Kosovo%20War">Kosovo</a> in 1999, <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">Afghanistan</a> in 2001 and <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq</a> since 2003 have been issued M249s. Surplus weapons were donated to <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a> and <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>.

Tactically, SAWs are either carried with a maneuvering unit and fired while handheld, or positioned to remain stationary and provide covering fire for other units. Upon introduction, the basic load of ammunition was 600 rounds, carried in three 200-round boxes. These boxes were carried in soft pouches named "Case, Small Arms, Ammunition, 200-Round Magazine". The modern load of ammunition carried for the weapon is 1,000 rounds in five 200-round belts, although up to 500 extra rounds generally gets loaded into 100-round soft pouches.

A supply of 929 M249 SAWs was issued to personnel from the U.S. Army and Marine Corps during the Persian Gulf War. Although exposure to combat was scarce, M249 gunners who were involved in fighting mainly used their weapons to provide cover fire for friendly maneuvering troops from fixed positions, rather than maneuvering with them. There were many complaints about the weapons clogging up with sand after prolonged use in the desert environment.

The standard squad automatic weapon in Afghanistan is the M249 with PIP kit, which serves alongside its heavier counterpart, the <a href="M240%20machine%20gun">M240 machine gun</a>. Most M249s were given a collapsible buttstock immediately prior to the invasion to reduce its length and make the weapons more practical for parachuting and close-quarters combat. Special Operations troops typically favor the shorter Para version of the weapon, which weighs much less.

A report entitled "Lessons Learned in Afghanistan" was released by Lieutenant Colonel Charlie Dean and SFC Sam Newland of the U.S. Army <a href="Natick%20Soldier%20Center">Natick Soldier Center</a> in 2002. They found that 54% of SAW gunners had problems maintaining their weapons, and 30% reported that the gun rusted easily. Soldiers reported ammunition boxes rattling and falling off. 80% percent of soldiers surveyed were pleased with the weapon's accuracy and lethality, yet only 64% claimed they were "confident in their weapon". Weapons clogging up with sand in the desert seems to be the main complaint.

The PIP and Para versions of the M249 have been used in the Iraq war since the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">invasion</a>. By 2004, many M249s had been in service for almost 20 years and were becoming increasingly unreliable. Soldiers were requesting replacements and new features, and there are reports of soldiers holding their weapons together with duct tape. The lethality of the 5.56 mm ammunition has been called into question by reports of enemy soldiers still firing after being hit multiple times. As in previous conflicts, the sandy environment causes the M249s and other weapons to clog up and jam if they are not cleaned frequently.

"Operation Iraqi Freedom PEO Soldier Lessons Learned", a report on the performance of weapons in the Iraq War, was published by Lieutenant Colonel Jim Smith of the U.S. Army on May 15, 2003. Smith spoke positively of the M249, claiming that it "provided the requisite firepower at the squad level as intended". He praised the SPW variant, noting that its "short barrel and forward pistol grip allowed for very effective use of the SAW in urban terrain". At the <a href="National%20Defense%20Industrial%20Association">National Defense Industrial Association</a> in 2007, LTC Al Kelly of the <a href="17th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">1st Battalion, 17th Infantry</a> gave a presentation describing the M249 as having "good range, excellent reliability" and an "excellent tracer". He said that a cloth pouch was preferred over the plastic box for holding linked ammunition, and that "knock-down power is poor but is compensated by rate of fire".

In December 2006, the <a href="Center%20for%20Naval%20Analyses">Center for Naval Analyses</a> released a report on U.S. small arms in combat. The CNA conducted surveys on 2,608 troops returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 12 months. Only troops who fired their weapons at enemy targets were allowed to participate. 341 troops were armed with M249 SAWs, making up 13 percent of the survey. 71 percent of M249 users (242 troops) reported that they were satisfied with the weapon. 40 percent of users preferred feeding the SAW with the soft 100-round pouch, while 21 percent chose the soft and hard 200-round pouches each. 60 percent (205 troops) were satisfied with handling qualities, such as handguards, size, and weight - of those dissatisfied, just under half thought that it was too heavy. M249 users had the lowest levels of satisfaction with weapon maintainability at 70 percent (239 troops), most due to the difficulty in removing and receiving small components and poor corrosion resistance. The SAW had the highest levels of stoppages at 30 percent (102 troops), and 41 percent of those that experienced a stoppage said it had a large impact on their ability to clear the stoppage and re-engage their target. 65 percent (222 troops) did not need their machine guns repaired while in theater. 65 percent (222 troops) were confident in the M249's reliability, defined as level of soldier confidence their weapon will fire without malfunction, and 64 percent (218 troops) were confident in its durability, defined as level of soldier confidence their weapon will not break or need repair. Both factors were attributed to high levels of soldiers performing their own maintenance. 60 percent of M249 users offered recommendations for improvements. 17 percent of requests were for making the weapon lighter, and another 17 percent were for more durable belt links and drums, as well as other modifications, such as a collapsible stock.

An extensive maintenance program intended to extend the service lives of M249s has been carried out to refurbish rifles, especially units that suffered from wear due to heavy use. In particular the warping of the receiver rails on the early-models was a defect that occurred in heavily used first-generation M249s. This defect however has been completely eliminated on later models and is no longer present on the current-issue M249, which has reinforced rails and full-length welding rather than <a href="spot%20welding">spot welding</a>. Also being worked on is replacement of the M249's buttstock with a redesigned adjustable stock.

The U.S. Marine Corps tested the <a href="M27%20Infantry%20Automatic%20Rifle">M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle</a>, a lighter, magazine-fed rifle to supplement and partially replace the M249. With plans to buy up to 4,100 IARs to complement and partially replace its 10,000 M249s (of which 8,000 will remain in service) held at <a href="platoon">platoon</a> level, it acquired 450 of the <a href="Heckler%20%26amp%3B%20Koch%20HK416">Heckler & Koch HK416</a>–based weapons for testing. The Marines started fielding the M27 in 2010, but kept both weapons in the inventory due to the M249's greater ammunition capacity and higher sustained fire rate; rifle companies are typically issued 27 IARs and six SAWs. The U.S. Army does not plan to introduce the IAR. Colonel Robert Radcliffe of the U.S. Army Infantry Research and Development Center stated that an automatic rifle with a magazine would lower the effectiveness and firepower of a squad. While the Marine Corps has 13-man squads, the Army organizes its soldiers into squads of nine and needs considerably more firepower from the squad machine gunners to make up the difference. The U.S. Army does, however, want to replace aging M249s with newer weapons.

In early 2017, the U.S. Army posted a notice soliciting bids for the Next Generation Squad Weapon-Automatic Rifle (NGSW-AR or NGSAR) to replace the M249. In July 2018, the Army awarded contracts to six companies including Textron, head of the preceding LSAT program where they made development leaps with cased telescoped (CT) ammunition, for NGSW-AR and ammunition prototypes. These first prototypes will be delivered to the Army for evaluation in June 2019. The stated requirements include:

Simon Hatley

Simon Hatley (27 March 1685after 1723) was an English sailor involved in two hazardous <a href="privateer">privateer</a>ing voyages to the <a href="South%20Pacific%20Ocean">South Pacific Ocean</a>. On the second voyage, with his ship beset by storms south of <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a>, Hatley shot an <a href="albatross">albatross</a>, an incident immortalised by <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a> in his poem, "<a href="The%20Rime%20of%20the%20Ancient%20Mariner">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a>."

Born in 1685 in <a href="Woodstock%2C%20Oxfordshire">Woodstock, Oxfordshire</a>, Hatley went to sea in 1708 as part of <a href="Woodes%20Rogers">Woodes Rogers</a>'s expedition against the Spanish. Although Rogers circumnavigated the world, Hatley was captured on the coast of present-day Ecuador and imprisoned in Lima, where he was tortured by the <a href="Inquisition">Inquisition</a>. He was released in 1713 and returned to Britain the same year.

Hatley's second voyage, under <a href="George%20Shelvocke">George Shelvocke</a>, was the source of the albatross incident, and also ended with his capture by the Spanish. As Hatley had, at Shelvocke's direction, looted a Portuguese vessel on the coast of Brazil, the Spanish this time held him as a pirate, though ultimately they released him again, deciding that Shelvocke was the more culpable party. Hatley returned to Britain in 1723, though he hastily sailed to Jamaica lest he risk trial for piracy. His fate thereafter is unknown. 

In 1797, <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a>, having read Shelvocke's account of that voyage, suggested Hatley's shooting of an albatross as the basis of a contemplated joint work with Coleridge. Wordsworth dropped out of the project soon after, but Coleridge continued, and the poem was published in "<a href="Lyrical%20Ballads">Lyrical Ballads</a>" (1798), containing poems by both men, and assuring Hatley a place in literary history.

The oldest child in a family of <a href="hatter">hatter</a>s, Simon Hatley was born on 27 March 1685 in <a href="Woodstock%2C%20Oxfordshire">Woodstock</a>, <a href="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>, England. His parents were Symon and Mary Hatley. Simon Hatley's mother's name at birth was Mary Herbert and, her son later stated while imprisoned by the Spanish, she was a Catholic. Her faith and name at birth possibly meant she was related to the <a href="Earl%20of%20Pembroke">Earls of Pembroke</a>, for they were also Catholic with the family name Herbert. The Hatley family was a prosperous one, owning a large house and three other rental properties on the High Street. The residence was pulled down and rebuilt in 1704, after Simon had left home. According to Simon Hatley's sole biographer, Robert Fowke, in 2010, "fittingly for the family of a son with piratical leanings, it was said to have been built with stone pilfered from the nearby construction site for <a href="Blenheim%20Palace">Blenheim Palace</a>."

Literate in <a href="Latin">Latin</a> as well as English, he would have attended the Woodstock Grammar School located up the road from where he lived. Although as the oldest son of a prosperous merchant, he probably could have followed in his father's trade, some time around 1699 he was apprenticed as a <a href="maritime%20pilot">pilot</a>, completing his formal training in <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>, by 1706 at the latest. In this era, the accounts of maritime explorations were widely published and read, and Hatley may have gained a love of adventure from them.

Much of what is known about Hatley's subsequent life is in connection with the two <a href="privateer">privateer</a>ing voyages that he made to the Pacific coast of South America. Privateers were men who sailed in armed merchant ships carrying <a href="letters%20of%20marque">letters of marque</a> from their government authorising them to plunder foreign enemies, keeping any profits for themselves and their ships' owners. The first such voyage made by Hatley was under the command of Captain <a href="Woodes%20Rogers">Woodes Rogers</a>, during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, which found Britain and Spain on opposing sides. In 1708, at the age of twenty-three, he signed on as <a href="third%20mate">third mate</a> (a junior officer position) of the "Duchess", the smaller of Rogers's two ships, the other being the "Duke". 

Rogers's vessels were then being readied in Bristol for a long and difficult journey to the Pacific coast of South America. The purpose of the Rogers expedition was to go around <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a> into the South Pacific, to damage Spanish settlements and interests along the South American Pacific coast, and to capture booty for their own profit, including the large <a href="Manila%20galleon">treasure galleons</a> that sailed from Manila to Mexico. The two ships were to be crammed with men, supplies to maintain them, and with guns and powder, for the success of the expedition depended on being able to outfight those vessels they sought to capture and plunder.

With a war on, finding qualified sailors was difficult, and in July 1708, Hatley was sent to Dublin, in Ireland, to fill out the ships' crews, with the aid of an assistant and a Dubliner, Humphry French. The "Duke" and the "Duchess" sailed from Bristol on 1 August 1708, and Hatley joined the "Duchess" when the vessels called at <a href="Cobh">Cork</a> three days later. Many of Hatley's recruits were not sailors, but at the time government regulations limited to one-half the proportion of professional seamen that private vessels such as Rogers's could have in their crews, lest none be available for ships of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. A total of 150 men joined at Cork, where the ships remained until the end of August, making good losses of 40 by desertion. When the ships sailed on 1 September, there were 183 in the "Duke" and 151 in the "Duchess".

On 8 September, the ships captured a Swedish vessel bound for <a href="Cadiz">Cadiz</a>, but as Britain was not at war with Sweden and searchers could find no contraband aboard, Rogers had to let her go. This provoked a near-mutiny on board the "Duke", as the sailors felt they had been cheated of plunder they were entitled to. Hatley and the "Duchess" were not directly involved, but he could not have avoided awareness of the problems, as there were tensions aboard the smaller vessel as well. The expedition captured a small Spanish ship off <a href="Tenerife">Tenerife</a>, but released her in exchange for supplies. Items taken from that ship were auctioned off among the sailors, and Hatley purchased a pair of silk hose. 

After <a href="Tacking_%28sailing%29%23Beating">beating</a> their way around Cape Horn, the two vessels stopped at the <a href="Juan%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20Islands">Juan Fernández Islands</a>, off the coast of Chile for resupply. The islands were believed to be uninhabited, but as the ships approached on 31 January 1709, sailors saw a fire on shore. The landing party were surprised to be met by one <a href="Alexander%20Selkirk">Alexander Selkirk</a>, a Scottish sailor who had been <a href="marooning">marooned</a> there by his <a href="captain%20%28nautical%29">captain</a> more than four years before and who was overjoyed at being rescued. The "Duke" pilot, <a href="William%20Dampier">William Dampier</a>, had also been on that earlier, <a href="Cinque%20Ports%20%281703%20ship%29">ill-fated cruise</a> with Selkirk, though in a different ship. Rogers made Selkirk <a href="second%20mate">second mate</a> of the "Duke". The ships lay in <a href="Cumberland%20Bay">Cumberland Bay</a> for almost two weeks, allowing for repair, resupply and some time ashore.

Having resupplied and otherwise prepared, the expedition began to raid Spanish commerce. To assure fairness, the committee of expedition members that advised Rogers decided that the officers and men of each ship would each appoint two agents, one to remain on the vessel, the other to transfer to the other ship. This meant a partisan would be able to monitor what plunder was captured by the other ship. Hatley was elected an agent for "Duchess"'s officers, and transferred to the "Duke". Thus, for a time, Hatley, who would inspire <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>'s <a href="albatross">albatross</a>-shooting <a href="Ancient%20Mariner">Ancient Mariner</a>, Selkirk, probably the original for <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a>'s <a href="Robinson%20Crusoe">Robinson Crusoe</a> and Dampier, possibly the inspiration for <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Jonathan Swift</a>'s <a href="Lemuel%20Gulliver">Lemuel Gulliver</a> (of "<a href="Gulliver%27s%20Travels">Gulliver's Travels</a>"), shared the same vessel. 

Opportunities for plundering were soon found; they captured several vessels, while negotiating the ransom of the town of <a href="Guayaquil">Guayaquil</a> in present-day Ecuador by threatening to burn it. Hatley played his part in these exploits, being in the "Duchess"'s <a href="pinnace%20%28ship%27s%20boat%29">pinnace</a> as part of a planned boarding party, when the expedition's two ships fought and captured a Spanish vessel known as the "Havre de Grace" in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Guayaquil">Gulf of Guayaquil</a> on 15 April, a sea battle that killed Rogers's brother John. When the main part of the expedition moved to capture Guayaquil on 18 April, Hatley was among those left behind on captured ships to guard the Spanish prisoners. With water becoming short, Hatley and another officer were detailed to command two of the captured ships (Hatley's was a <a href="barque">barque</a>) and go to <a href="Puna%20Island">Puna Island</a> to collect water and seek news of the expediion. There they met Rogers and learned that the attack on Guayaquil had been successful, although not as profitable as hoped. 

Rogers's expedition would ultimately <a href="circumnavigate">circumnavigate</a> the globe, but Hatley did not make it that far. He remained in command of his barque as the Rogers expedition re-entered the Pacific Ocean proper. Hatley had perhaps six sailors under him, and as well as about the same number of prisoners. With water short and many sailors ill from a disease contracted in Guayaquil, the search for fresh water became increasingly desperate. But Hatley's ship went astray, and despite Rogers's efforts to search for her, was not seen again. Lanterns were hung and guns fired, in the hopes he would perceive them, but to no avail. It was thought that the prisoners had murdered Hatley and his crew. Wrote Rogers in his account of the expedition, "we all bewailed Mr Hatley and were afraid he was lost."

With food short—one of the prisoners died—Hatley's crew forced him to make for the coast of what is now Ecuador. There, in late May 1709, a native spotted the ship, and Hatley and his crew were captured. The natives abused them, but a priest intervened, probably saving their lives. Hatley and his men were transported south to Lima, now in Peru, where they were confined in the prison on the <a href="Plaza%20de%20Armas">Plaza Real</a>. There, he was tortured by the <a href="Inquisition">Inquisition</a>, once being taken to a gallows with one of his fellows and half-strangled before being cut down. He smuggled several letters out, but only one survives, dated 6 November 1709, and addressed to the sponsors of the Rogers voyage, in Bristol. This one reached Britain, and may have been the first news to reach Bristol about the fate of the Rogers expedition. Under the persuasion of the Inquisition, Hatley accepted conversion to Catholicism in 1710, and was freed, though required to remain in Peru, in December of that year. The merchant sponsors of the Rogers expedition petitioned the British Government, and, in 1711, <a href="William%20Legge%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Dartmouth">Lord Dartmouth</a> instructed the new governor of Jamaica to do what he could for British prisoners in the hands of the Spanish. In 1713, with peace between Spain and Britain restored, Hatley was allowed to leave, and returned to his native land, having learned Spanish. The Rogers expedition had returned in 1711, and the sale of the goods was still ongoing, as was litigation. Hatley was paid £180 10s 2d in August 1713 and later that year an additional forty pounds for his role in the taking of the "Havre de Grace".

Symon Hatley had died in 1712, leaving real estate in Woodstock to his son Simon, though with a <a href="life%20estate">life estate</a> to his widow, giving her the income from the rental properties for her lifetime. In 1718, mother and son sold those properties for £140.

When the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Quadruple%20Alliance">War of the Quadruple Alliance</a> (1717–1720) brought a renewal of hostilities between Britain and Spain, Hatley joined another privateering expedition as second captain of the "Speedwell", under <a href="George%20Shelvocke">George Shelvocke</a>, the expedition leader. As Hatley was already familiar with their South Pacific destination, his knowledge and experience made him a desirable hire for the voyage. The "Speedwell" was the smaller of the two ships that went on the expedition; the larger was named "Success".

Delayed by difficulties over their privateering commissions and a lack of favourable winds, the expedition left <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> on 13 February 1719. The ships became separated and sailed independently after that; Shelvocke's conduct in doing so was subsequently the cause of litigation. On 4 June, at <a href="Cape%20Frio">Cape Frio</a>, in Brazil, the "Speedwell" encountered a Portuguese ship. In spite of the fact that the Portuguese were allies of Britain, Shelvocke sent Hatley across with an armed crew. They left with gold and other valuables. Then, the ship anchored at the present-day site of <a href="Florianopolis">Florianopolis</a>, Brazil on 20 June, and would not finally leave until mid-August. During that time, the crew repaired the vessel and gathered supplies in preparation for the Cape Horn passage. At the end of July, Shelvocke recorded, the crew demanded new terms for division of the expedition's plunder, stating that Rogers's crew had never received the full measure of what was due them. Shelvocke blamed Hatley for this episode, though whether it was a mutiny or done with the leader's connivance is uncertain, as the result left Shelvocke in control of how winnings would be divided and with a greater share of the treasure. Hatley also got into trouble with the locals, insulting one of their leaders, and Shelvocke, in his journal, accused Hatley of abusing the women.

In his journal entry for 1 October 1719 (see adjacent quotation), Shelvocke recorded the incident, the shooting of the albatross, for which Hatley joined his former shipmate Selkirk in being immortalised in literature. This took place about south of Cape Horn. According to Shelvocke's account, Hatley shot the bird believing it portended ill-luck, and in the hope of fairer winds. Fowke noted that at that time there was no taboo against killing albatrosses, and this was something invented by Coleridge when he wrote of the incident. Sailors sometimes baited them with food, though their oily taste was not greatly liked. A biographer of Rogers, Bryan Little, suggested that the harsh treatment of Hatley by the Spanish in Lima may have contributed to the "melancholy fits" in the midst of which he shot the albatross. In spite of Hatley's attempt, the winds did not calm, but the ship was able to round Cape Horn, battling northward along the coast of Chile, through stormy weather.

Once clear of the weather, the "Speedwell" began raiding along the coast, capturing several small vessels, one of which, renamed "Mercury", Hatley was placed in command of. At Hatley's suggestion, since he knew the coast, Shelvocke had him operate independently to capture small vessels near the coast of Peru and Ecuador. On 9 March 1720, the "Mercury"'s crew saw a ship that they initially assumed to be the "Speedwell". It was too late to run when they realised it was a Spanish warship, the "Brilliant". Hatley sent those sailors who were obviously British in appearance below, trying to make it appear his ship was still under Spanish control. The stratagem failed when three sailors, British by their dress, suddenly emerged from below decks, and the "Brilliant" fired, slightly wounding Hatley. Captured, the British sailors, including Hatley, were landed at <a href="Paita">Paita</a> and transported to Lima.

By this time Britain and Spain were again at peace, and all the prisoners but Hatley were soon released; he was kept chained and in solitary confinement. They accused him of piracy because of the looting of the Portuguese ship at Cape Frio; a purse had been found among his possessions with 96 <a href="moidore">moidore</a>s, and he faced hanging or hard labor in the mines. There was uncertainty as to whether the Lima authorities could try him for a crime against the Portuguese, and with Shelvocke's reputation poor even among the British (he was arrested and briefly imprisoned for the incident upon his return, though acquitted due to lack of witnesses), they decided that the expedition commander was probably the responsible party. Hatley was released in 1723.

What became of Hatley after 1723 is uncertain. He faced the possibility of a piracy prosecution in England because of the Cape Frio incident. Immediately upon his return, he sailed for Jamaica, then a den of pirates, without presenting himself to the owners of the Shelvocke expedition. Nothing is known of him thereafter; Fowke speculated he continued as a sailor.

According to <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a>, the poem "<a href="The%20Rime%20of%20the%20Ancient%20Mariner">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a>" was conceived while he and Coleridge were walking together in the <a href="Quantock%20Hills">Quantock Hills</a> of <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a> in November 1797. The two were considering the fate of <a href="Cain">Cain</a>, condemned to wander the earth for killing his brother <a href="Abel">Abel</a>, for a contemplated joint poetic work. The discussion turned to a book that Wordsworth was reading, Shelvocke's "A Voyage Round the World by Way of the Great South Sea", in which the incident of Hatley shooting the albatross is told. "Much the greatest part of the story was Coleridge's invention", Wordsworth later wrote, though it was Wordsworth's idea that the main <a href="plot%20device">plot device</a> of the narrative should involve the killing of an albatross in the South Sea, for which "the tutelary spirits of these regions take upon them to avenge the crime." Wordsworth soon found their poetic styles incompatible and withdrew from the project, but Coleridge continued. "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" was published in their joint work, "<a href="Lyrical%20Ballads">Lyrical Ballads</a>", in 1798.
Tim Beattie, in his book on the privateering voyages of the early 18th century, deemed Shelvocke an unreliable witness, placing in doubt whether the albatross incident actually occurred, but considered Coleridge's use of it a testimonial to the enduring appeal of the books recounting the sea voyages. Hatley's shooting of an albatross differs in some regards from the Ancient Mariner's. Hatley shot the bird in the hopes of fairer winds; no motive is given for the Mariner's deed. The shooting by the Mariner is followed by retribution, the hanging of the albatross around the Mariner's neck, followed by other torments. Hatley, although he underwent trials and tribulations after shooting the albatross, these were at the hands of the Spanish and were not directly connected to the killing of the albatross. The Mariner is subsequently <a href="wikt%3Ashrive%23Verb">shriven</a> by the Hermit. According to Fowke, there was "no forgiveness for Hatley and clearly there were things to forgive. He took ship for Jamaica fearing a second trial."

He was found not guilty but was dismissed from the police service for gross misconduct. Following subsequent civil proceedings, the Metropolitan Police paid Tomlinson's family an undisclosed sum and acknowledged that Harwood's actions had caused Tomlinson's death.

The first <a href="autopsy">post-mortem</a> concluded that Tomlinson had suffered a heart attack, but a week later "The Guardian" published video of Harwood, a constable with London's <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police Service</a>, striking Tomlinson on the leg with a baton, then pushing him to the ground. Tomlinson was not a protester, and at the time he was struck was trying to make his way home through the police cordons. He walked away after the incident, but collapsed and died minutes later.

After the <a href="Independent%20Police%20Complaints%20Commission">Independent Police Complaints Commission</a> (IPCC) began a criminal inquiry, further autopsies indicated that Tomlinson had died from internal bleeding caused by blunt force trauma to the abdomen, in association with <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a> of the liver. The <a href="Crown%20Prosecution%20Service">Crown Prosecution Service</a> (CPS) decided not to charge Harwood, because the disagreement between the first and later pathologists meant they could not show a causal link between the death and alleged assault. That position changed in 2011; after the verdict of unlawful killing, the CPS charged Harwood with manslaughter. He was acquitted in 2012 and dismissed from the service a few months later.

Tomlinson's death sparked a debate in the UK about the relationship between the police, media and public, and the independence of the IPCC. In response to the concerns, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, <a href="Denis%20O%27Connor%20%28police%20officer%29">Denis O'Connor</a>, published a 150-page report in November 2009 that aimed to restore Britain's consent-based model of policing.

Tomlinson was born to Jim and Ann Tomlinson in Matlock, Derbyshire. He moved to London when he was 17 to work as a scaffolder. At the time of his death, at the age of 47, he was working casually as a vendor for the "Evening Standard", London's evening newspaper. Married twice with nine children, including stepchildren, Tomlinson had a history of alcoholism, as a result of which he had been living apart from his second wife, Julia, for 13 years, and had experienced long periods of homelessness. He had been staying since 2008 in the Lindsey Hotel, a shelter for the homeless on Lindsey Street, <a href="Smithfield%2C%20London">Smithfield</a>, <a href="EC%20postcode%20area">EC1</a>. At the time of his death, he was walking across London's financial district in an effort to reach the Lindsey Hotel, his way hampered at several points by police lines. The route he took was his usual way home from a newspaper stand on <a href="Monument%20to%20the%20Great%20Fire%20of%20London">Fish Street Hill</a> outside <a href="Bank%E2%80%93Monument%20station">Monument tube station</a>, where he worked with a friend, Barry Smith.

With over 31,000 officers, the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police Service</a> (the Met) is the largest police force in the United Kingdom, responsible for policing Greater London, except for the financial district, the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>. The latter has its own force, the <a href="City%20of%20London%20Police">City of London Police</a>. The Met's <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Police%20of%20the%20Metropolis">commissioner</a> at the time was Sir <a href="Paul%20Stephenson%20%28police%20officer%29">Paul Stephenson</a>; the City of London Police commissioner was <a href="Mike%20Bowron">Mike Bowron</a>. Responsibility for supervising the Met falls to the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Authority">Metropolitan Police Authority</a>, chaired by the Mayor of London, at the time <a href="Boris%20Johnson">Boris Johnson</a>.

The officer seen pushing Tomlinson was a constable with the Met's <a href="Territorial%20Support%20Group">Territorial Support Group</a> (TSG), identified by the "U" on their shoulder numbers. The TSG specializes in public-order policing, wearing military-style helmets, flame-retardant overalls, <a href="stab%20vest">stab vest</a>s and balaclavas. Their operational commander at the time was Chief Superintendent Mick Johnson.

The <a href="Independent%20Police%20Complaints%20Commission">Independent Police Complaints Commission</a> (IPCC) began to operate in 2004; its chair when Tomlinson died was <a href="Nick%20Hardwick%20%28chairman%29">Nick Hardwick</a>. Created by the Police Reform Act 2002, the commission replaced the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) following public dissatisfaction with the latter's relationship with the police. Unlike the PCA, the IPCC operates independently of the <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a>, which is the Government department responsible for criminal justice and policing in England and Wales.

The G20 security operation, codenamed "Operation Glencoe", was a "Benbow operation", which meant the Met, City of London Police and the <a href="British%20Transport%20Police">British Transport Police</a> worked under one <a href="Gold%20Silver%20Bronze%20command%20structure">Gold commander</a>, in this case <a href="Bob%20Broadhurst">Bob Broadhurst</a> of the Met.

There were six protests on 1 April 2009: a security operation at <a href="ExCeL%20London">ExCeL London</a>, a <a href="Stop%20the%20War%20Coalition">Stop the War</a> march, a <a href="Tibetan%20independence%20movement">Free Tibet</a> protest outside the Chinese Embassy, a <a href="People%20%26amp%3B%20Planet">People & Planet</a> protest, a <a href="2009%20G-20%20London%20summit%20protests%23Climate%20Camp">Climate Camp</a> protest, and a protest outside the <a href="Bank%20of%20England">Bank of England</a>. Over 4,000 protesters were at the Climate Camp and the same number at the Bank of England. On 1 April over 5,500 police officers were deployed and the following day 2,800, at a cost of £7.2 million. Officers worked 14-hour shifts. They ended at midnight, slept on the floor of police stations, were not given a chance to eat, and were back on duty at 7 am. This was viewed as having contributed to the difficulties they faced.

The Bank of England protesters were held in place from 12.30 pm until 7.00 pm using a process police called "containment" and the media called "<a href="kettling">kettling</a>"—corralling protesters into small spaces until the police dispersed them. At 7 pm senior officers decided that "reasonable force" could be used to disperse the protesters around the bank. Between 7:10 and 7:40 pm the crowd surged toward the police, missiles were thrown, and the police pushed back with their shields. Scuffles broke out and arrests were made. This was the situation Tomlinson wandered into as he tried to make his way home.

Several newspapers published images of Tomlinson's first encounter with police that evening. According to Barry Smith, Tomlinson left the newspaper stand outside Monument <a href="London%20Underground">Tube</a> Station at around 7 pm. The "Daily Mail" published an image showing Tomlinson smoking a cigarette in front of a police van in <a href="Lombard%20Street%2C%20London">Lombard Street</a>. An eyewitness, IT worker Ross Hardy, said Tomlinson was drunk and refusing to move; a police van tried to nudge him out of the way, and when that didn't work he was moved by four police officers wearing personal protective equipment ("PPE"). The newspaper published a second image of him apparently being pushed by the police. On 16 April "The Guardian" published three images of Tomlinson taken at the same time.

Tomlinson stayed on Lombard Street for another half hour, then made his way to <a href="King%20William%20Street%2C%20London">King William Street</a>, toward two lines of police cordons, where police had "kettled" thousands of protesters near the Bank of England. At 7:10 pm he doubled back on himself, walking up and down Change Alley where he encountered more cordons, and five minutes later was on Lombard Street again, crossed it, walked down Birchin Lane, and reached <a href="Cornhill%2C%20London">Cornhill</a> at 7:10–7:15 pm.

A few minutes later he was at the northern end of a pedestrian precinct, Royal Exchange Passage (formally called Royal Exchange Buildings), near the junction with <a href="Threadneedle%20Street">Threadneedle Street</a>, where a further police cordon stopped him from proceeding. He turned to walk south along Royal Exchange Passage instead, where, minutes before he arrived, officers had clashed with up to 25 protesters. Riot police from the Met's TSG, accompanied by City of London police dog handlers, had arrived there from the cordon in Threadneedle Street to help their colleagues.

Police officers followed Tomlinson as he walked along the street. He headed towards Threadneedle Street, but again ran into police cordons and doubled back on himself towards Cornhill. According to a CPS report, he was bitten on the leg by a police dog at 7:15 pm, when a dog handler tried to move him out of the way, but he appeared not to react to it.

The same group of officers approached Tomlinson outside a Montblanc store at the southern end of Royal Exchange Passage, near the junction with Cornhill. He was walking slowly with his hands in his pockets; according to an eyewitness, he was saying that he was trying to get home.

The first "Guardian" video shows one officer lunge at Tomlinson from behind, strike him across the legs with a baton and push his back, causing him to fall. On 8 April Channel 4 News released their own footage, which showed the officer's arm swing back to head height before bringing it down to hit Tomlinson on the legs with the baton. Another video obtained by "The Guardian" on 21 April shows Tomlinson standing by a bicycle rack, hands in his pockets, when the police approach him. After he is hit, he can be seen scraping along the ground on the right side of his forehead; eyewitnesses spoke of hearing a noise as his head hit the ground.

Tomlinson can be seen briefly remonstrating with police as he sits on the ground. None of the officers offered assistance. After being helped to his feet by a protester, Tomlinson walked along Cornhill, where he collapsed at around 7:22 pm outside 77 Cornhill. Witnesses say he appeared dazed, eyes rolling, skin grey. They also said he smelled of alcohol. An ITV News photographer tried to give medical aid, but was forced away by police, as was a medical student. Police medics attended to Tomlinson, who was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital.

Simon Harwood, the officer who struck Tomlinson, was a police constable with the <a href="Territorial%20Support%20Group">Territorial Support Group</a> (TSG) at Larkhall Lane police station in Lambeth, South London. Harwood had faced 10 complaints in 12 years, nine of which had been dismissed or unproven. The complaint that was upheld involved unlawful access to the <a href="Police%20National%20Computer">Police National Computer</a>. The complaints included a road-rage incident in or around 1998 while he was on sick leave, during which he reportedly tried to arrest the other driver, who alleged that Harwood had used unnecessary force. On Friday, 14 September 2001, before the case was heard by a discipline board, Harwood retired on medical grounds. Three days later, on Monday, 17 September, he rejoined the Met as a civilian computer worker.

In May 2003 Harwood joined the Surrey Police as a constable. Surrey Police said he was frank about his history. In January 2004 he was alleged to have assaulted a man during a raid on a home. In November 2004, on his request, Harwood was transferred back to the Met. There were three more complaints after that, before the incident with Tomlinson.

Harwood was involved in several confrontations on the day of Tomlinson's death. He had been on duty since 5 am, assigned as a driver, and had spent most of the day in his vehicle. While parked on Cornhill in the evening, he saw a man write "all cops are bastards" on the side of another police van, and left his vehicle to arrest him. The suspect's head struck a van door, triggering a response from the crowd that made Harwood believe it was unsafe to return to his vehicle. He told the inquest that he had been hit on the head, had fallen over, lost his baton, had been attacked by the crowd and feared for his life, but later acknowledged this had not happened.

Shortly after his attempted arrest of the graffiti man, Harwood swung a coat at a protester, pulled a BBC cameraman to the ground, used a palm strike against one man, and at 7:19 pm pushed another man to the ground for allegedly threatening a police dog handler. It was seconds after this that he saw Tomlinson standing with his hands in his pockets beside a bicycle rack, being told by police to move away. Harwood told the inquest he made a "split-second decision" that there was justification for engagement, then struck Tomlinson on the thigh with his baton and pushed him to the ground. He said it was a "very poor push" and he had been shocked when Tomlinson fell. Harwood made no mention of the incident in his notebook; he told the inquest he had forgotten about it.

Newspapers did not release Harwood's name until July 2010. On the day of the incident, he appeared to have removed his shoulder number and covered the bottom of his face with his balaclava. The "Daily Mail" published an image showing his shoulder ID missing. Simon Israel of Channel 4 News reported a detailed description of the officer on 22 April 2009; the IPCC sought but failed to obtain an injunction to prevent Channel 4 broadcasting the description, alleging that it might prejudice their inquiry. Fifteen months later, when announcing in July 2010 that no charges would be brought against Harwood, the Crown Prosecution Service still referred to him as "PC A." It was only on that day that newspapers decided to name him.

Harwood said he first realized on 8 April, when he saw the "Guardian" video, that Tomlinson had died. He reportedly collapsed at home and had to be taken to hospital by ambulance. Harwood and three colleagues made themselves known to the IPCC that day.

The Met issued its first statement on 1 April at 11:36 pm, four hours after Tomlinson died, a statement approved by the IPCC's regional director for London. The statement said that police had been alerted that a man had collapsed and were attacked by "a number of missiles" as they tried to save his life, an allegation that was inaccurate, according to later media reports.

According to <a href="Nick%20Davies">Nick Davies</a> in "The Guardian", the statement was the result of an intense argument in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said the statement represented the truth as they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies asked why the IPCC were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.

On 2 April the Met handed responsibility for the investigation to the City of London police; the officer in charge was Detective Superintendent Anthony Crampton. After police briefings, the "Evening Standard" reported on 2 April that "police were bombarded with bricks, bottles and planks of wood" as they tried to save Tomlinson, forced by a barrage of missiles to carry him to a safe location to give him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

Eyewitnesses said the story was inaccurate. They said protesters had provided first aid and telephoned for medical help. Others said that one or two plastic bottles had been thrown by people unaware of Tomlinson's situation, but other protesters had told them to stop. According to "The Times", an analysis of television footage and photographs showed just one bottle, probably plastic, being thrown. Video taken by eyewitness Nabeela Zahir, published by "The Guardian" on 9 April, shows one protester shouting, "There is someone hurt here. Back the fuck up." Another voice says, "There's someone hurt. Don't throw anything."

Three police constables from the Hammersmith and Fulham police station—Nicholas Jackson, Andrew Moore, and Kerry Smith—told their supervisor, Inspector Wynne Jones, on 3 April that they had witnessed the incident. They can be seen in "The Guardian" video standing next to Tomlinson. Jackson was the first to tell the inspector; officers then contacted Moore and Smith, who had been standing next to Jackson at the time.

Jackson, Moore and Smith did not recognize Simon Harwood, the officer who struck Tomlinson, and according to the newspaper assumed he was with the City of London police. This was four days before "The Guardian" published the video. The inspector passed this information at 4:15 pm on 3 April to Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, the Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death. Hall said he passed it to the City of London police before the first autopsy was conducted that day by Freddy Patel, which according to "The Guardian" began at 5 pm.

An inquest was opened on 9 April 2009 by Paul Matthews, the City of London coroner. Three post-mortems were conducted: on 3 April by Mohmed Saeed Sulema "Freddy" Patel for Paul Matthews; on 9 April by Nathaniel Cary for the IPCC and Tomlinson's family; and on 22 April jointly by Kenneth Shorrock for the Metropolitan police and Ben Swift for Simon Harwood. The coroner was criticized for reportedly having failed to allow IPCC investigators to attend the first, and for failing to tell Tomlinson's family that they had a legal right to attend or send a representative. The family also said he had not told them where and when it was taking place.

According to Detective Sergeant Chandler of the City of London police, he was not told until the first post-mortem was over, or at an advanced stage, that three police officers had seen another officer hit and push Tomlinson. Apparently neither Patel nor the IPCC were told about the three witnesses. Patel said he was told only that the case was a "suspicious death"; the police had asked that he "rule out any assault or crush injuries associated with public order."

Patel concluded that Tomlinson had died of <a href="coronary%20artery%20disease">coronary artery disease</a>. His report noted "intraabdominal fluid blood about 3l with small blood clot," which was interpreted by medical experts to mean that he had found three litres of blood in Tomlinson's abdomen. This would have been around 60 percent of Tomlinson's total blood volume, a "highly significant indicator of the cause of death," according to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). In a report for the CPS a year later, on 5 April 2010, Patel wrote that he had meant "intraabdominal fluid with blood." He did not retain samples of the fluid for testing. This issue became pivotal regarding the decision not to prosecute Harwood. The City of London police issued a statement on 4 April: "A post-mortem examination found he died of natural causes. [He] suffered a sudden heart attack while on his way home from work."

The IPCC told reporters that the post-mortem showed no bruising or scratches on Tomlinson's head and shoulders. When the family asked the City of London police, after the post-mortem, whether there had been marks on Tomlinson's body, they were told no; according to "The Guardian", Detective Superintendent Anthony Crampton, who was leading the investigation, wrote in his log that he did not tell the family about a bruise and puncture marks on Tomlinson's leg to avoid causing "unnecessary stress or alarm." On 5 April "The Observer" published the first photograph of Tomlinson lying on the ground next to riot police. After it was published, Freddy Patel was asked to return to the mortuary, where he made a note of bruising on Tomlinson's head that he had not noticed when he first examined him. On 24 April Sky News obtained an image of Tomlinson after he collapsed, which showed bruising on the right side of his forehead.

The IPCC removed the Tomlinson inquiry from the City of London police on 8 April. A second post-mortem, ordered jointly by the IPCC and Tomlinson's family, was carried out that day by Nathaniel Cary, known for his work on high-profile cases.<ref name="LewisDoddApril10/2">Paul Lewis Lewis, Vikram Dodd, <a href="https%3A//www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/10/g20-assault-investigation">"Ian Tomlinson death: G20 riot officer in footage has not been interviewed"</a>, "The Guardian", 10 April 2009.</ref> Cary found that Tomlinson had died because of internal bleeding from blunt force trauma to the abdomen, in association with cirrhosis of the liver. He concluded that Tomlinson had fallen on his elbow, which he said "impacted in the area of his liver causing an internal bleed which led to his death a few minutes later."

Because of the conflicting conclusions of the first two, a third post-mortem was conducted on 22 April by Kenneth Shorrock on behalf of the Metropolitan police, and Ben Swift on behalf of Simon Harwood. Shorrock and Swift agreed with the results of the second autopsy. The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, told the pathologists before the final post-mortem that Tomlinson had fallen to the ground in front of a police van earlier in the evening, although there was no evidence that this had happened. The IPCC ruled in May 2011 that Hall had been reckless in making this claim, but had not intended to mislead.

At the time of Tomlinson's death, Patel was on the Home Office's register of accredited <a href="forensic%20pathologist">forensic pathologist</a>s. He qualified as a doctor at the <a href="University%20of%20Zambia">University of Zambia</a> in 1974, and registered to practise in the UK in 1988. The Metropolitan Police had written to the Home Office in 2005 raising concerns about his work. At the time of Tomlinson's death he did not have a contract with the police to conduct post-mortems in cases of suspicious death.

In 1999 Patel was reprimanded by the General Medical Council (GMC) for having released medical details about <a href="Death%20of%20Roger%20Sylvester">Roger Sylvester</a>, a man who had died in police custody. In 2002 the police dropped a criminal inquiry because Patel said the victim, Sally White, had died of a heart attack with no signs of violence, although she was reportedly found naked with bruising to her body, an injury to her head and a bite mark on her thigh. <a href="Anthony%20Hardy">Anthony Hardy</a>, a mentally ill alcoholic who lived in the flat in which her body was found locked in a bedroom, later murdered two women and placed their body parts in bin bags. The police investigated Patel in relation to that autopsy, but the investigation was dropped.
In response to the criticism, Patel said the GMC reprimand was a long time ago, and that his findings in the Sally White case had not been contested.

Patel was suspended from the government's register of pathologists in July 2009, pending a GMC inquiry. The inquiry concerned 26 charges related to autopsies in four other cases. In one case Patel was accused of having failed to spot signs of abuse on the body of a five-year-old girl who had died after a fall at home, and of having failed to check with the hospital about its investigation into her injuries. The child's body was exhumed for a second postmortem, and her mother was convicted. The hearings concluded in August 2010; Patel was suspended for three months for "deficient professional performance." In May 2011 the GMC opened an investigation into his handling of the Tomlinson post-mortem. He was struck off the medical register in August 2012.

On 5 April "The Observer" (the "Guardian"'s sister paper) published the first photograph of Tomlinson lying on the ground next to riot police. Over the next few days the IPCC told reporters that Tomlinson's family were not surprised that he had had a heart attack. When journalists asked whether he had been in contact with police officers before his death, they were told the speculation would upset the family.

The first "Guardian" video was shot on a digital camera by an investment fund manager from New York who was in London on business, and who attended the protests out of curiosity. On his way to Heathrow airport, he realized that the man he had filmed being assaulted was the man who had reportedly died of a heart attack. At that point, 2 am on 7 April, he passed his footage to "The Guardian", which published it on its website that afternoon. The newspaper passed a copy to the IPCC, which opened a criminal inquiry.

A video by Ken McCallum, a cameraman for Channel 4 News, was broadcast on 8 April. Shot from a different angle, the footage shows Harwood draw his arm back to head height before bringing the baton down on Tomlinson's legs. McCallum was filming another incident at the time; the Tomlinson incident was unfolding in the background, unseen by the journalists but recorded by the camera. Half an hour later <a href="Alex%20Thomson%20%28journalist%29">Alex Thomson</a>, chief correspondent of Channel 4 News, was doing a live broadcast when the camera was damaged. It took engineers days to recover the tape, which is when they saw that Tomlinson's assault was on it.

On 9 April "The Guardian" published footage from Nabeela Zahir, a freelance journalist, showing Tomlinson after his collapse. The police can be seen moving away at least one woman who tried to help him, and a man, Daniel McPhee, who was on the phone to the ambulance services. The footage shows that the Met's initial claim that there had been a barrage of missiles from protesters while police tried to save Tomlinson was inaccurate. Protesters can be heard calling for calm; one shouts "Don't throw anything." According to "The Guardian", 56 seconds into the video, three officers can be seen with their face masks pulled halfway up their faces.

"The Guardian" obtained a four-minute video on 21 April from an anonymous bystander who had been filming on Cornhill between 7:10 and 7:30 pm. The footage shows Tomlinson standing behind a bicycle rack in Royal Exchange Passage with his hands in his pockets, and a group of advancing police officers. When a police dog approaches him, he turns his back. At that point, he is hit on the legs and pushed by the TSG constable, and can be seen scraping along the ground on the right side of his forehead. Eyewitnesses said they heard a noise as his head hit the ground. The IPCC sought an injunction against the broadcast of the video by Channel 4 News, but a judge rejected the application. An image obtained by Sky News on 24 April appears to show bruising on the right side of Tomlinson's forehead. A head injury was recorded by the second and third pathologists.

Nick Hardwick, chair of the IPCC, said on 9 April that there were no CCTV cameras in the area. On 14 April the "Evening Standard" wrote that it had found at least six CCTV cameras in the area around the assault. After photographs of the cameras were published, the IPCC reversed its position and said its investigators were looking at footage from cameras in <a href="Threadneedle%20Street">Threadneedle Street</a> near the corner of Royal Exchange Passage.

Tomlinson's death sparked a discussion about the nature of Britain's policing and the relationship between the police, public, media and IPCC. The mayor of London, <a href="Boris%20Johnson">Boris Johnson</a>, dismissed the criticism of the police as "an orgy of cop bashing." The death was compared to others that had each acted as a watershed in the public's perception of policing, including that of <a href="Blair%20Peach">Blair Peach</a> (1979), <a href="Murder%20of%20Stephen%20Lawrence">Stephen Lawrence</a> (1993) and <a href="Jean%20Charles%20de%20Menezes">Jean Charles de Menezes</a> (2005). The IPCC was criticized for having taken seven days from Tomlinson's death, and five days after hearing evidence that police may have been involved, to remove the City of London police from the investigation.

David Gilbertson, a former assistant inspector who had worked for the Home Office formulating policing policy, told "The New York Times" that the British police used to act with the sanction of the public, but that tactics had changed after a series of violent assaults on officers in the 1990s. Now dressing in military-style uniforms and equipped with anti-stab vests, extendable metal batons and clubs that turn into handcuffs, an entire generation of officers has come to regard the public as the enemy, the newspaper said.

Tomlinson's death was confirmed in a statement that accused protesters of having hampered police efforts to save his life. His family were not told he had died until nine hours after his death. The police and IPCC told journalists that his family were not surprised to hear he had had a heart attack. Journalists who asked whether police had had any contact with Tomlinson were asked not to speculate in case it upset the family. Direct contact with the family was refused. The police issued a statement on behalf of the family instead, which said the police were keeping them informed.

"The Observer" ("The Guardian"'s sister paper) published an image of Tomlinson on the ground on Sunday, 5 April. That morning Tomlinson's family attended the scene of his death, where they met <a href="Paul%20Lewis%20%28journalist%29">Paul Lewis</a>, a "Guardian" reporter who had worked on "The Observer" story. Tomlinson's wife said this meeting was the first the family had heard of police contact with Tomlinson before his death. The family's police liaison officer later approached the newspaper to say he was "extremely unhappy" that Lewis had spoken to the family, and that the newspaper had to stay away from them for 48 hours. The IPCC accused the newspaper of "doorstepping the family at a time of grief." On the same day, the IPCC briefed other journalists that there was nothing in the story that Tomlinson might have been assaulted by police. During this period, according to Tomlinson's family, they were prevented from seeing his body; they were first allowed to see him six days after his death.

On 7 April "The Guardian" published the American banker's video, and later that evening handed it to an IPCC investigator and a City of London police officer who arrived at the newspaper's offices. The officers asked that the video be removed from the website, arguing that it jeopardized their inquiry and was not helpful to the family. Nick Hardwick, chair of the IPCC, said the IPCC had asked "The Guardian" to remove the video only because it would have been better had witnesses not seen it before being questioned.

The Chief Inspector of Constabulary, <a href="Denis%20O%27Connor%20%28police%20officer%29">Denis O'Connor</a>, published a 150-page report in November 2009 that aimed to restore Britain's consent-based model of policing.

O'Connor wrote that there had been a hardening of police attitudes, with officers believing that proportionality meant <a href="Norm%20of%20reciprocity">reciprocity</a>. The deployment of officers in riot gear had become a routine response to lawful protest, largely the result of an ignorance of the law and a lack of leadership from the Home Office and police chiefs. Officers were being trained to use their riot shields as weapons. Police forces across the country differed in their training, the equipment they had access to, and their understanding of the law. The failure to understand the relevant legislation was in part due to its complexity, the report said, with 90 amendments to the Public Order Act passed since 1986.

The report made several recommendations, including the creation of a set of national principles emphasizing the minimum use of force at all times, and making the display of police ID a legal requirement. In February 2010 the Met announced that 8,000 of its officers had been issued with embroidered epaulettes, as several had complained that the numbers were falling off, rather than being removed deliberately.

In April 2010 "The Guardian" published an open letter from several public figures asking the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to proceed with a prosecution or explain its position. In July that year <a href="Keir%20Starmer">Keir Starmer</a>, director of the CPS, announced that there would be no prosecution because of the medical disagreement between the three pathologists. Starmer said there was enough evidence for an assault charge, but the six-month deadline for that had expired.

The area of conflict concerned Patel's finding during the first autopsy of "intraabdominal fluid blood about 3l with small blood clot." This was interpreted by other medical experts to mean that Patel had found three litres of blood in Tomlinson's abdomen. Starmer said this would have been around 60 percent of Tomlinson's blood volume, a "highly significant indicator of the cause of death."

In April 2010 Patel introduced an ambiguity in a second report for the CPS, saying he had found "intraabdominal fluid blood about 3l with small blood clot" [emphasis added]. The ambiguity had to be clarified, because the second and third pathologists had relied in part on Patel's original notes to form their views. Patel was interviewed twice by the CPS. According to Starmer, Patel "maintained that the total fluid was somewhat in excess of three litres but that it was mainly <a href="ascites">ascites</a> (a substance which forms in a damaged liver), which had been stained with blood. He had not retained the fluid nor had he sampled it in order to ascertain the proportion of blood because, he said, he had handled blood all his professional life and he knew that this was not blood but blood-stained ascites." Patel also said he had found no internal rupture that would have led to this degree of blood loss.

Several conclusions were drawn from discussions between Patel and the CPS, Starmer said: (a) because Patel had not retained or sampled the three litres of fluid, no firm conclusions could be drawn about the nature of it; (b) for Tomlinson's death to have resulted so quickly from blood loss, there would have to have been a significant internal rupture; (c) Patel found no such rupture; (d) the later postmortems also found no visible rupture; and (e) because Patel was the only person to have examined Tomlinson's intact body, he was in the best position to judge the nature of the fluid, and whether there was a rupture that could have caused it. This meant that Patel's evidence would significantly undermine the evidence of the second and third pathologists.

Nathaniel Cary, the second pathologist, objected to the CPS's decision. Cary told "The Guardian" that the push had caused a haemorrhage to Tomlinson's abdomen, and the haemorrhage caused him to collapse. Cary said Tomlinson was vulnerable to this because he had liver disease. The CPS had erred in dismissing a charge of <a href="actual%20bodily%20harm">actual bodily harm</a> (ABH), in his view. In a letter to Tomlinson's family, the CPS described Tomlinson's injuries as "relatively minor" and therefore insufficient to support such a charge. But Cary told "The Guardian": "The injuries were not relatively minor. He sustained quite a large area of bruising. Such injuries are consistent with a baton strike, which could amount to ABH. It's extraordinary. If that's not ABH I would like to know what is."

The inquest was opened and adjourned in April 2009. The City of London coroner, Paul Matthews, expressed concern about whether he had appropriate expertise, and <a href="Peter%20Thornton%20%28judge%29">Peter Thornton QC</a>, who specializes in protest law, took over. The inquest opened on 28 March 2011 before a jury. The court heard from Kevin Channer, a cardiologist at Royal Hallamshire Hospital, who analysed <a href="electrocardiogram">electrocardiogram</a> (ECG) data from the defibrillator paramedics had used on Tomlinson. He said the readings were inconsistent with an arrhythmic heart attack, but consistent with death from internal bleeding. Pathologist Nat Carey concurred regarding the cause of death. Graeme Alexander, a <a href="Hepatology">hepatologist</a>, said that in his opinion Tomlinson had died of internal bleeding as a result of trauma to the liver after the fall. He told the court that Tomlinson had been suffering from serious liver disease, which would have made him susceptible to collapse from internal bleeding.

Giving evidence over three days, Harwood said that Tomlinson "just looked as if he was going to stay where he was forever and was almost inviting physical confrontation in terms of being moved on." He said he had not warned Tomlinson and had acted because Tomlinson was encroaching a police line, which amounted to a breach of the peace. The court heard that Tomlinson's last words after collapsing were, "they got me, the fuckers got me"; he died moments later. On 3 May 2011 the jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing, ruling that the officer—Harwood was not named for legal reasons—had used excessive and unreasonable force in hitting Tomlinson, and had acted "illegally, recklessly and dangerously."

In May 2011 the IPCC released three reports into Tomlinson's death, written between April 2010 and May 2011. The main report contained material revealed during the inquest. The third report detailed an allegation from Tomlinson's family that the police had offered misleading information to the pathologists before the third autopsy on 22 April 2009. The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, had told the pathologists that Tomlinson had fallen to the ground in front of a police van earlier in the evening, although there was no evidence to support this. The IPCC ruled that Hall had been reckless in making this claim, but had not intended to mislead the pathologists.

Keir Starmer, director of the CPS, announced on 24 May 2011 that a summons for manslaughter had been issued against Harwood. He said the CPS had reviewed its decision not to prosecute because new medical evidence had emerged during the inquest, and because the various medical accounts, including that of the first pathologist, had been tested during questioning. The trial opened on 18 June 2012. Harwood entered a plea of not guilty, and was acquitted on 19 July.

The court was shown extensive video footage of Tomlinson and Harwood on the day. Harwood was seen trying to arrest a man who had daubed graffiti on a police van, then joining a line of officers who were clearing Royal Exchange Passage. Harwood pushed a man who blew a <a href="vuvuzela">vuvuzela</a> at him, then appeared to push a BBC cameraman who was filming the arrest of another man. The footage showed Harwood push a third man out of the way, and shortly after this (the passageway now almost empty) the officers reached Tomlinson.

Mark Dennis QC, for the prosecution, argued that Harwood's use of force against Tomlinson had been unnecessary and unreasonable, and had caused Tomlinson's death. He argued that a "clear temporal link" between the incident and Tomlinson's collapse had been provided by the "Guardian video", that Tomlinson had posed no threat, and that the use of force had been a "gratuitous act of aggression." The defence argued that Tomlinson's health was relevant. The court heard that he had liver and brain disease caused by alcohol abuse, numbness in his legs and balance problems, and that he had been treated at least 20 times between 2007 and 2009, mostly at A&E departments, related to falling while drunk. On the day he died, "The Times" reported, he had drunk a bottle of red wine, a small bottle of vodka and several cans of 9-per-cent super-strength lager.

Harwood told the court that Tomlinson had ignored orders to move along. He acknowledged that he had pushed Tomlinson firmly, but said he had not expected him to fall. He also acknowledged that he had "got it wrong," and said he had not realized Tomlinson was in such poor health. The jury found him not guilty after deliberating for four days.

Harwood was dismissed from the Metropolitan Police Service in September 2012 after a disciplinary hearing found that he had acted with "gross misconduct" in his actions towards Tomlinson. Tomlinson's family filed a lawsuit against the Metropolitan Police, which paid the family an undisclosed sum in August 2013. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Maxine de Brunner issued a formal apology for "Simon Harwood's use of excessive and unlawful force, which caused Mr Tomlinson's death, and for the suffering and distress caused to his family as a result."

John F. Bolt

John Franklin Bolt (19 May 1921 – 8 September 2004) was a <a href="naval%20aviator">naval aviator</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> and a decorated <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a> who served during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. He remains the only U.S. Marine to achieve ace status in two wars and was also the only Marine <a href="jet%20engine">jet</a> <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter</a> ace. He rose to the rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant colonel</a> during his military career.

Born to a poor family in <a href="Laurens%2C%20South%20Carolina">Laurens, South Carolina</a>, Bolt was a self-described "<a href="workaholic">workaholic</a>" and was involved in numerous groups and social activities throughout his life. After dropping out of the <a href="University%20of%20Florida">University of Florida</a> for financial reasons in 1941, he joined the US Navy and trained as a Marine Corps pilot. Sent to the <a href="Asiatic-Pacific%20Theater">Pacific Theater of Operations</a>, he flew an <a href="F4U%20Corsair">F4U Corsair</a> during the campaigns in the <a href="Marshall%20Islands%20campaign">Marshall Islands</a> and <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea</a>, claiming six victories against <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> <a href="A6M%20Zero">A6M Zero</a>s.

Bolt continued his service through the Korean War, entering combat through an exchange program with the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> (USAF) in late 1952. Over a period of several weeks in mid-1953, he led flights of <a href="F-86%20Sabre">F-86 Sabre</a>s into combat with <a href="MiG-15">MiG-15</a>s of the <a href="People%27s%20Liberation%20Army%20Air%20Force">Chinese Air Force</a>, scoring six victories during fights along the northern border of <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a>, commonly known as "<a href="MiG%20Alley">MiG Alley</a>," giving him a total of 12 victories over his career.

Bolt stayed in the Marine Corps until 1962, serving as an analyst and instructor in his later career, before retiring and earning a <a href="Juris%20Doctor">Juris Doctor</a> degree from the University of Florida. He subsequently settled down in <a href="Florida">Florida</a> and began a private <a href="real%20estate%20law">real estate law</a> practice; he continued to be active in law until 1991. He died from <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a> in 2004.

John Bolt was born on 19 May 1921 in <a href="Laurens%2C%20South%20Carolina">Laurens, South Carolina</a>, to Thomas Crews Bolt and Brucie Bolt (née Bagwell). John had a younger brother, Bruce. In 1924 the family moved to <a href="Sanford%2C%20Florida">Sanford, Florida</a>. In his youth, John Bolt gained the nickname "Jack" from his friends and family. His family was poor and he was for the most part responsible for providing his own clothes and social expenses from the time he was ten years old. He worked several part-time jobs, at one point working 30 to 40 hours a week at a local <a href="creamery">creamery</a> in addition to attending school. He also enrolled in the <a href="World%20Organization%20of%20the%20Scout%20Movement">Boy Scouts</a>, eventually attaining the rank of <a href="Star%20Scout%20%28Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%29">Star Scout</a>.

In June 1939, Bolt began attending <a href="Seminole%20High%20School%20%28Seminole%20County%2C%20Florida%29">Seminole High School</a>. Described as modest and hardworking by his high school classmates, he was elected <a href="class%20president">class president</a> in his final two years in school.

Bolt attended the <a href="University%20of%20Florida">University of Florida</a>, majoring in <a href="accounting">accounting</a> and meeting most of the costs himself using money that he had saved while working through high school. He joined <a href="Phi%20Eta%20Sigma">Phi Eta Sigma</a>, an <a href="honor%20society">honor society</a> and <a href="Professional%20fraternities%20and%20sororities">professional fraternity</a>, and <a href="Alpha%20Tau%20Omega">Alpha Tau Omega</a>, a <a href="List%20of%20social%20fraternities%20and%20sororities">social fraternity</a>. In 1941, his brother Bruce also enrolled at Florida, straining the family's expenses; John dropped out after his second year so that his brother could complete his degree. Bolt enlisted in the <a href="Marine%20Forces%20Reserve">Marine Corps Reserve</a> in April 1941 to train as a pilot, but deferred his training when the Marine Corps offered him the chance to finish college and attend <a href="law%20school">law school</a>, paying him 500 a year to do so.

Bolt left for <a href="basic%20training">basic training</a> in June 1941. Though he intended to join the <a href="US%20Marine%20Corps">US Marine Corps</a>, he signed up for the <a href="US%20Navy">US Navy</a> Flight Training Program, which would allow him to fly for the Marines. On completion of his basic training in November 1941, he was selected as a pilot, and moved to <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Atlanta">Naval Air Station Atlanta</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> in February 1942. He was placed on <a href="active%20duty">active duty</a> just before the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> and the United States' entry into <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Completing his initial pilot training and transferring to <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Jacksonville">Naval Air Station Jacksonville</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a> for the next phase, he started flight training in the <a href="T-6%20Texan">SNJ Texan</a>. He also qualified to fly in the <a href="Naval%20Aircraft%20Factory%20N3N%20Canary">N3N Canary</a> trainer aircraft. His final phase of flight lessons occurred in <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Miami">Naval Air Station Miami</a> in <a href="Miami%2C%20Florida">Miami, Florida</a>, where he flew the <a href="Grumman%20F3F">Grumman F3F</a>, a <a href="biplane">biplane</a> which was the Navy's most advanced trainer at the time. Bolt completed this training on 18 July 1942, and was <a href="commissioned%20officer">commissioned</a> as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the U.S. Marine Corps, receiving his <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Aviator">aviator wings</a> that day as well.

Around this time, Bolt began dating Dorothy E. Wiggins, whom he knew from Sanford. The two married after two years of dating, and they eventually had two children together, Robert and Barbara. Years later, during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, Bolt had the words "Darling Dottie" stencilled on the side of his <a href="North%20American%20F-86%20Sabre">North American F-86 Sabre</a> jet as a tribute to this wife.

After commissioning, Bolt was assigned as a cadet training instructor, training aviation cadets at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Jacksonville">Naval Air Station Jacksonville</a> and at Naval Auxiliary Air Station <a href="Green%20Cove%20Springs%2C%20Florida">Green Cove Springs, Florida</a>, until December 1942, when the unit was deactivated. Until May 1943 he was trained on the <a href="Grumman%20F4F%20Wildcat">F4F Wildcat</a>, a <a href="carrier-based%20aircraft">carrier-based aircraft</a>, in preparation for movement to a front-line combat unit. Over the next few months, Bolt was stationed at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Glenview">Naval Air Station Glenview</a> in <a href="Glenview%2C%20Illinois">Glenview, Illinois</a>, where he trained for 60 hours aboard the <a href="paddle%20steamer">paddlewheel</a> <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> <a href="USS%20Wolverine%20%28IX-64%29">USS "Wolverine"</a>. After qualifying to operate carrier-based aircraft, he was assigned to <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Miramar">Marine Corps Air Station Miramar</a> in <a href="San%20Diego%2C%20California">San Diego, California</a>, until June 1943, when he and his class departed for the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific Theater</a> aboard the <a href="USS%20Rochambeau%20%28AP-63%29">USS "Rochambeau"</a>.

On his way to the front lines, Bolt traveled to a number of islands as the "Rochambeau" stopped at <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a> and <a href="New%20Hebrides">New Hebrides</a> to avoid <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s. Upon arrival at <a href="Espiritu%20Santo">Espiritu Santo</a>, Bolt was placed in a pool of new officers who were intended to replace casualties in several squadrons. Casualties at this time proved to be less than expected, so the replacement pool was used to form a new <a href="squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadron</a>. The new unit was designated <a href="VMF-214">VMF-214</a>, and became known as the "Black Sheep" because its pilots had originally not been assigned to a squadron. Under the command of <a href="US%20Major">Major</a> <a href="Pappy%20Boyington">Pappy Boyington</a>, the unit was equipped with <a href="F4U%20Corsair">F4U Corsair</a>s. Moved after several months to the <a href="Russell%20Islands">Russell Islands</a>, they were ready for combat by 13 September. Bolt flew the aircraft every chance he got, and although new to the war in the Pacific, Bolt had over 700 hours flying in the F4U Corsair by September, more than many combat pilots accrued in two combat tours.

On 14 September, the squadron began flying missions to escort <a href="B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a> bombers. The Japanese had 200 aircraft at <a href="Kahili%20Airfield">Kahili Airfield</a> and <a href="Balalae%20Island">Balalae Island</a>, opposed by only 50 aircraft from the U.S. squadrons in the area. The first couple of missions that the squadron undertook were relatively quiet but, on 16 September, VMF-214 was attacked by a group of 35 Japanese <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">A6M Zeros</a>. The squadron repelled the strike, destroying 11 Japanese aircraft for the loss of only one of their own. Several costly engagements with the strong Japanese forces in the area followed. Bolt did not score any victories during this time, but was promoted to <a href="first%20lieutenant">first lieutenant</a> that month.

Bolt got his first victories of the deployment on 23 September when he was with a flight of 15 VMF-214 aircraft escorting B-24 Liberators back from a raid on Kahili. The bombers had been followed by 20 to 30 Zeros, and a <a href="dogfight">dogfight</a> quickly ensued. During the course of the engagement over <a href="Bougainville%20Strait">Bougainville</a>, Bolt scored two victories. His wingman, Ed Harper, also claimed a victory. For the next several weeks, the squadron operated out of <a href="Munda%20Airport">Munda</a> in the Solomon Islands.

A self-described "workaholic" Bolt was considered by the other pilots to be the most energetic member of the squadron. He took to collecting and sending home keepsakes from daily life on the front lines; he and two other pilots were known as the "Quartermaster Kids" because they collected so many souvenirs and shipped them home. He could often be found in the harbor near their airstrip dynamiting fish and was known to organize many of the squadron's <a href="pig%20roast">pig roast</a>s and beer parties. Bolt also took it upon himself to test out many different ammunition configurations for the .50 caliber guns on the F4U during his free time. His research was conducted by firing rounds into <a href="Drum%20%28container%29">50-gallon drums</a> partially filled with <a href="gasoline">gasoline</a> and at abandoned aircraft in the <a href="Espiritu%20Santo">Espiritu Santo</a> boneyard. He found that incendiary rounds were more effective, and convinced his squadron, and eventually most of the aircraft squadrons in the Pacific Theater, to begin firing six <a href="Incendiary%20ammunition">incendiary rounds</a> for every one <a href="Armor-piercing%20shot%20and%20shell">armor-piercing</a> or <a href="Tracer%20ammunition">tracer round</a>, rather than firing one for one.

Bolt became well known—but also drew the ire of his squadron's commanding officer—during what began as an escort mission for B-24 Liberators. The bombers were lost in the clouds and the flight ran into poor weather, forcing them to turn back. During the flight home, the U.S. pilots noticed much Japanese surface traffic but did not engage because of the weather. On their way back to Munda one of the aircraft had a mechanical problem, and a group including Bolt had to land at <a href="Barakoma%20Airfield">Barakoma Airfield</a> on <a href="Vella%20Lavella">Vella Lavella</a>. He tried to convince others to go with him to attack the ships they had seen, but they refused. He refueled and took off, against Boyington's orders, and destroyed four enemy barges and strafed several ground concentrations in the vicinity of Tonolei Harbor before returning to Munda. Disobeying a direct order drew Boyington's wrath until the next day, when a telegram was received from <a href="Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Admiral</a> <a href="Bull%20Halsey">William "Bull" Halsey</a>: "That one man war ... conducted by Lieut Bolt against Jap stuff in Tonolei, warm heart (<a href="Full%20stop%23Use%20in%20telegrams">stop</a>) Halsey."

On 17 October, during a mission over Kahili Airfield, Bolt's squadron was ambushed by Japanese fighters. Bolt downed one of the Japanese aircraft in his last mission before a scheduled <a href="R%26amp%3BR%20%28military%29">rest and recuperation</a> (R&R) in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, Australia.

When the squadron returned from its R&R, Bolt had been promoted to <a href="captain%20%28United%20States%20O-3%29">captain</a> and the squadron had been relocated to Vella Lavella. The new base was within of <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a>, which was the center of Japanese activity on <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a>, and was the squadron's next primary target. Defended by 98,000 Japanese troops, the island was of great strategic importance as it had a harbor and several airfields and was within striking distance of the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a>, defended by 400 Japanese aircraft.

On 23 December, 16 Corsairs from VMF-214 formed part of a force of 120 U.S. fighters and bombers that undertook a mission over Rabaul. The strike against the city and harbor areas was countered by a large force of Japanese aircraft. While defending the bombers, Bolt shot down two more Japanese aircraft, making him the squadron's sixth <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a>. Two days later, he took part in another mission during which his squadron mates claimed four victories, bringing VMF-214's tally of confirmed aerial victories to 76.

On 3 January 1944, VMF-214 was among 75 U.S. aircraft raiding near Rabaul when they were surprised by 300 Japanese aircraft. Boyington was shot down and parachuted into the <a href="St.%20George%27s%20Channel%20%28Papua%20New%20Guinea%29">St. George's Channel</a>. The next day, Bolt led a flight of four Corsairs from VMF-214 in search of Boyington. Despite hazy weather and the need to take an indirect route to avoid Japanese radar, Bolt managed to lead the flight to the area where the battle had taken place the day before. Although they did not spot Boyington, they discovered and engaged a flotilla of Japanese barges, destroying six of them. Bolt also claimed his sixth victory against a Japanese aircraft attempting to defend the barges.

Bolt's tour, along with the rest of VMF-214, came to an end on 8 January 1944, five days after Boyington was shot down and captured by the Japanese. VMF-214 was disbanded and its pilots assigned to other units. In his time with VMF-214, Bolt developed a reputation among his peers as a leader and an accomplished pilot. He was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> twice, and scored a total of six confirmed victories and one probable victory and two aircraft damaged in his 92 missions with the squadron.

Bolt was reassigned to <a href="VMF-211">VMF-211</a>, at an <a href="Nissan%20Island%20Airport">airfield</a> on <a href="Nissan%20Island">Nissan Island</a> in the <a href="Green%20Islands%20%28Papua%20New%20Guinea%29">Green Islands</a>, north of Bougainville and west of Rabaul. The aircraft there were primarily concerned with the destruction of convoys and ships. The missions, nicknamed "Truck Busters", were very successful, but at the cost of damaged aircraft and wounded crewmen, including Bolt's wingman. This tour lasted until May 1944 when Bolt returned to <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Santa%20Barbara">Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara</a> with his squadron.

Reassigned, Bolt flew to Hawaii, then to <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach, California</a>. He reunited with Dorothy Wiggins in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, and the two married on 23 May 1944 in <a href="Oakland%2C%20California">Oakland</a>, before going on a one-month honeymoon. His next assignment was with the newly formed <a href="VMF-471">VMF-471</a> at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20El%20Toro">Marine Corps Air Station El Toro</a>. While posted to VMF-471, he attended the Aviation Ground Officer's School at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Quantico">Marine Corps Air Station Quantico</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, from November 1944 through February 1945. He saw no combat for the rest of the war, but did manage to break the Corsair endurance record by keeping an aircraft aloft for 14 hours and 9 seconds. After briefly returning to VMF-471, Bolt was reassigned to <a href="VMF-215">VMF-215</a> in March 1945, tasked with training pilots for new carrier-based aircraft. He remained in this role until <a href="V-J%20Day">V-J Day</a>, the end of hostilities.

Following the war, Bolt served in various units around El Toro. He was at various times assigned to <a href="MASG-46">MASG-46</a>, <a href="VMF-512">VMF-512</a>, <a href="VMF-323">VMF-323</a>, <a href="VMF-312">VMF-312</a>, <a href="VMF-452">VMF-452</a>, and <a href="Marine%20Aircraft%20Group%2012">Marine Aircraft Group 12</a> (MAG-12), before transferring to Quantico again in November 1949 to attend the Aircraft Maintenance Course. Diving in Florida's Tampa Bay on leave, Bolt (then a captain) set a world <a href="spearfishing">spearfishing</a> record when he caught an <a href="Atlantic%20goliath%20grouper">Atlantic goliath grouper</a> weighing hundreds of pounds.

In May 1950, Bolt was reassigned to <a href="VMF-224">VMF-224</a> at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Cherry%20Point">Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point</a>, <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, and he remained there until May 1951. The squadron flew the <a href="F2H%20Banshee">F2H Banshee</a> and within three months of joining the unit he had flown more hours on the aircraft than any other pilot in the squadron. This was followed by a quick four-month tour on the staff at the <a href="2nd%20Marine%20Aircraft%20Wing">2nd Marine Aircraft Wing</a>. During this time, the <a href="US%20Air%20Force">US Air Force</a> was operating its first squadron of <a href="F-86%20Sabre">F-86 Sabre</a> aircraft. The Sabres were the only U.S. aircraft which performed well against the <a href="MiG-15">MiG-15</a>s operated by China and <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a> in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. Bolt used his connections to enter an exchange program with the USAF in September 1951, becoming an exchange officer with the <a href="318th%20Fighter%20Interceptor%20Squadron">318th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron</a> at <a href="McChord%20Air%20Force%20Base">McChord Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Washington%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Washington</a> flying the <a href="F-94%20Starfire">F-94 Starfire</a>. Soon after, he began piloting the F-86F Sabre which had been transferred to the squadron. He continued training with the squadron and was promoted to <a href="Major%20%28US%29">major</a> in December 1951.

In November 1952, Bolt transferred to squadron <a href="VMF-115">VMF-115</a>, an element of the <a href="1st%20Marine%20Aircraft%20Wing">1st Marine Aircraft Wing</a> flying <a href="F9F%20Panther">F9F Panther</a> <a href="fighter-bomber">fighter-bomber</a> aircraft in South Korea. He flew 94 combat missions with the squadron, all of them in bombing runs and <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a> and <a href="air%20strike">air strike</a> missions against ground targets. He did not enjoy this duty, preferring instead to fly the Sabre in air-to-air combat. As his squadron headed to Japan for R&R, he traveled to <a href="Seoul">Seoul</a> to visit the <a href="4th%20Fighter-Interceptor%20Wing">4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing</a> at <a href="Kimpo%20Airfield">Kimpo Airfield</a>.

At the 4th Wing, Bolt met with its commander, <a href="Colonel%20%28US%29">Colonel</a> <a href="Royal%20N.%20Baker">Royal N. Baker</a>, who refused his request to fly in combat units. He then went to the <a href="51st%20Fighter-Interceptor%20Wing">51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing</a> at <a href="Suwon%20Air%20Base">Suwon Air Base</a> to observe its operations, where he met with <a href="George%20I.%20Ruddell">George I. Ruddell</a>, an acquaintance from El Toro, who was commanding the <a href="39th%20Fighter-Interceptor%20Squadron">39th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron</a>. Ruddell agreed to let Bolt join his unit as part of another officer exchange. This apparently angered some of his commanders in VMF-115, and Bolt only completed a requisite six weeks of duty with the wing prior to its next R&R.

Six weeks later, Bolt again turned down his R&R and joined the 39th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, flying the F-86 Sabre. Ruddell assigned him to First Lieutenant <a href="Joseph%20C.%20McConnell">Joseph C. McConnell</a>, who would be the top ace in the war. Bolt and McConnell quickly established a close friendship in spite of Bolt's superior rank, and he attributed his success in Korea to McConnell's guidance. Ruddell sent a request to <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28US%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Glenn%20O.%20Barcus">Glenn O. Barcus</a>, commander of the <a href="Fifth%20United%20States%20Air%20Force">Fifth United States Air Force</a>, that Bolt's tour with the squadron be extended. The request was granted, and McConnell and Bolt began going on combat missions together as wingmen in MiG Alley, the area in northwestern Korea where air-to-air combat was most frequent. Bolt's Sabre, <a href="United%20States%20military%20aircraft%20serials">tail number</a> 52-2582, was named "Darling Dottie."

By May, McConnell was rotated back to the United States and Bolt was given charge of the flight; in 16 combat missions and 27 combat hours, his flight had never engaged any MiG fighters. This changed on 16 May, when the flight was attacked by a group of MiG fighters at . He was quickly tailed by one of the aircraft, but managed to avoid its fire and tail another MiG himself. With several well placed shots, Bolt forced its pilot to bail out. Six days later on 22 May, MiG aircraft attacked again, and he managed to outmaneuver a fighter which had been attacking his wingman and shoot it down at . On 24 June, he flew his 31st combat mission, during which he engaged a single MiG and shot it down after a quick battle in the vicinity of the Yalu River. A week later on 30 June, he was flying another mission in the same area when he spotted and quickly shot down another MiG. By the end of the month, he had credit for four victories and two aircraft "damaged".

On 11 July, Bolt led another flight of four fighters in a reconnaissance mission above <a href="Sinuiju">Sinuiju</a>, his 37th combat mission of the deployment. Two of the aircraft departed after their fuel tanks were depleted, leaving him with one wingman to continue the patrol. Soon after, the two pilots spotted a formation of four MiGs taking off from <a href="Dandong%20Langtou%20Airport">Antung airfield</a> on the Chinese side of the Yalu River. Despite being low on fuel, Bolt ordered an attack. He made a head-on dive toward the formation, which was attempting to gain altitude, and downed the leading airplane with four machine gun bursts. He then banked his aircraft and aimed for the second aircraft in the formation, continuing the attack and scoring hits on its fuselage. The pilot bailed out, and the remaining two MiGs fled. Within the first five minutes of the engagement, Bolt shot down two of the MiGs. This brought his tally of confirmed victories during the war to six. For these actions he became the final Marine aviator to be awarded the <a href="Navy%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Navy Cross</a> during the war. Bolt is the only non-USAF pilot to become an ace in the F-86 and the only naval aviator to become an ace in two wars. Shortly after this final mission, his tour of duty ended and he was rotated back to the United States for an extended rest and vacation, which he spent with his family.

Following his return from Korea, Bolt was assigned to the U.S. Navy <a href="Bureau%20of%20Aeronautics">Bureau of Aeronautics</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> as an aircraft design engineer. In this duty, he was detailed to <a href="The%20Pentagon">The Pentagon</a> and a board which reported on aircraft performance and tactics. A press conference was held in September 1953 to welcome him to the position, and during this he recounted stories from his service in Korea for the first time to local newspapers. Bolt's experiences in World War II and the Korean War were used to help shape air combat doctrine. He worked in this assignment for around a year, until 1954 when he was promoted to <a href="US%20Lieutenant%20Colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> and moved to the <a href="Naval%20Pilot%20Test%20Center">Naval Pilot Test Center</a> at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Patuxent%20River">Naval Air Station Patuxent River</a>, in <a href="St.%20Mary%27s%20County%2C%20Maryland">St. Mary's County, Maryland</a>. During this time, he took evening classes at the <a href="University%20of%20Maryland">University of Maryland</a>, eventually earning a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Science">Bachelor of Science</a> in <a href="Military%20History">Military History</a>.

In 1957, Bolt was ordered to Marine Corps Base Quantico to attend a one-year course at the Senior School of Amphibious Warfare as part of a program which would later be incorporated into the accredited curriculum of the <a href="Marine%20Corps%20University">Marine Corps University</a>. On 5 November, after this one-year stint, he was assigned to command VMF-214, his World War II squadron, at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Facility%20Kaneohe%20Bay">Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay</a> on the <a href="Hawaiian%20Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a>. The squadron, which was part of <a href="Marine%20Aircraft%20Group%2013">Marine Aircraft Group 13</a>, flew the <a href="FJ-4%20Fury">FJ-4 Fury</a>; Bolt remained in command of it until 14 August 1959. His final assignment as an instructor was at the Senior School of Amphibious Warfare at Quantico. He taught at this school for the final three years of his career, before retiring from the Marine Corps on 31 March 1962.

After retiring from the Marine Corps, Bolt, then 40 years old, began a new career in agriculture. He and his wife moved back to Sanford, Florida, where he worked for Chase & Co. He remained in that position for five years, until 1967. That year, he decided to follow his original career aspirations to be a lawyer. He enrolled in the <a href="Fredric%20G.%20Levin%20College%20of%20Law">College of Law</a> at the University of Florida, where his son Robert was also in attendance. The two formed an <a href="American%20handball">American handball</a> team during their spare time, and won several tournaments. Bolt's program had a three-year curriculum, but he completed the degree in 27 months, graduating with a <a href="Juris%20Doctor">Juris Doctor</a> degree in December 1969. For two years after graduation, he stayed with the university to teach, and from 1969 to 1971 he was a law professor as well as the president of the <a href="Board%20of%20Trustees">Board of Trustees</a> of Alpha Tau Omega, the fraternity he had joined while an undergraduate at the university.

After this stint as an instructor, Bolt and his wife moved to <a href="New%20Smyrna%20Beach">New Smyrna Beach</a>, a place both of them had enjoyed in their childhoods. He began a private law practice and became a local property owner. During this time he was described as a "softspoken, kind, gentle person who would go out of his way to help a friend or a stranger." He specialized in <a href="real%20estate%20law">real estate law</a> and was the attorney for the city's utilities commission for 13 years. He retired from law in 1991.

Bolt subsequently lived a quiet life and kept frequent contact with his children. Robert became a lawyer in <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa, Florida</a>, and Barbara wrote for "<a href="Reader%27s%20Digest">Reader's Digest</a>". In May 1993, Bolt attended the 50th reunion of the original "Black Sheep" or the <a href="8th%20Fighter%20Squadron">8th Fighter Squadron</a> in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, and gave the toast at the beginning of the festivities. In 2003, he was inducted into the American Combat Airman Hall of Fame at the <a href="American%20Airpower%20Heritage%20Museum">American Airpower Heritage Museum</a> in <a href="Midland%2C%20Texas">Midland, Texas</a>.

Bolt died of <a href="leukemia">acute leukemia</a> in Tampa on 8 September 2004 after fleeing the approaching <a href="Hurricane%20Frances">Hurricane Frances</a>. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving of the seven Americans to become aces in both World War II and Korea. He was survived by his wife and children, as well as two grandchildren.

Bolt scored a total of 12 confirmed aerial victories during his career, with an additional "probable" victory and two aircraft damaged. He was the only U.S. Marine Corps pilot to become an ace in the Korean War, and remains the only U.S. Marine Corps pilot to be an ace in two wars. Bolt was one of 1,297 <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20aces%20from%20the%20United%20States">World War II aces from the United States</a> with six confirmed victories during that war. He later became one of 40 <a href="List%20of%20Korean%20War%20flying%20aces">Korean War aces from the United States</a> with six more confirmed victories during that war.

Bolt is one of seven U.S. pilots who achieved ace status as both a piston-engined pilot in World War II and as a jet pilot in Korea. The others are all USAF pilots: <a href="Francis%20S.%20Gabreski">Francis S. Gabreski</a>, <a href="James%20P.%20Hagerstrom">James P. Hagerstrom</a>, <a href="William%20T.%20Whisner">William T.

Bolt was decorated during World War II and the Korean War. His military decorations and awards include:

South Park (season 13)

The thirteenth season of "<a href="South%20Park">South Park</a>", an American animated television comedy series, originally aired in the United States on <a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a> between March 11 and November 18, 2009. The season was headed by the series creators <a href="Trey%20Parker">Trey Parker</a> and <a href="Matt%20Stone">Matt Stone</a>, who served as <a href="executive%20producer">executive producer</a>s along with Anne Garefino. The season continued to focus on the exploits of protagonists <a href="Stan%20Marsh">Stan</a>, <a href="Kyle%20Broflovski">Kyle</a>, <a href="Eric%20Cartman">Cartman</a>, <a href="Kenny%20McCormick">Kenny</a> and <a href="Butters%20Stotch">Butters</a> in the fictional <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a> mountain town of South Park.

The season was the first of three new seasons Parker and Stone agreed to produce for the network under a renewal deal. It consisted of fourteen 22-minute episodes, which aired in two groups of seven episodes separated by a six-month gap. Prior to the season's premiere, all "South Park" episodes were made available for free viewing on the official series website, "South Park Studios". The 13th season was the first to be broadcast in <a href="High-definition%20television">high definition</a> and in widescreen. Continuing their practice from previous seasons, Parker and Stone wrote and produced each episode within the week before its broadcast date.

The 13th season satirized such topics as the <a href="ACORN%202009%20undercover%20videos%20controversy">ACORN scandal</a>, <a href="Japanese%20whaling">Japanese whaling</a>, <a href="piracy%20in%20Somalia">piracy in Somalia</a> and the marketing tactics of <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">The Walt Disney Company</a>. Celebrities were spoofed throughout the season, including the <a href="Jonas%20Brothers">Jonas Brothers</a>, <a href="Kanye%20West">Kanye West</a>, <a href="Carlos%20Mencia">Carlos Mencia</a>, <a href="Paul%20Watson">Paul Watson</a> and <a href="Glenn%20Beck">Glenn Beck</a>, all of whom publicly responded to their portrayals. The episode "<a href="Fishsticks%20%28South%20Park%29">Fishsticks</a>" attracted particular media attention due to rapper Kanye West's declaration that its jokes about his arrogance were funny but hurt his feelings. "<a href="The%20F%20Word%20%28South%20Park%29">The F Word</a>", in which the central characters attempt to change the definition of the word "<a href="faggot%20%28slang%29">fag</a>", was especially controversial and prompted complaints from the <a href="Gay%20%26amp%3B%20Lesbian%20Alliance%20Against%20Defamation">Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation</a>. A broadcast of "<a href="Pinewood%20Derby%20%28South%20Park%29">Pinewood Derby</a>" in Mexico was pulled, allegedly due to its depiction of President <a href="Felipe%20Calder%C3%B3n">Felipe Calderón</a>. "<a href="Fatbeard">Fatbeard</a>" was praised by the crew of the <a href="USS%20Bainbridge%20%28DDG-96%29">USS "Bainbridge"</a>, which was involved in the <a href="Maersk%20Alabama%20hijacking">2009 rescue</a> of the <a href="MV%20Maersk%20Alabama">MV "Maersk Alabama"</a> from Somali pirates.

The 13th season received mixed reviews: some critics called it one of "South Park"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s strongest seasons, while others claimed the series was starting to decline in quality. The season maintained the average <a href="Nielsen%20rating">Nielsen rating</a> viewership for the series, around 3 million viewers per episode. The episode "<a href="Margaritaville%20%28South%20Park%29">Margaritaville</a>", which satirized the <a href="Late-2000s%20recession">global recession</a> then affecting much of the industrialized world, won the 2009 <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a> for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Animated%20Program%20%28for%20Programming%20Less%20Than%20One%20Hour%29">Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)</a>.

Series creators <a href="Trey%20Parker">Trey Parker</a> and <a href="Matt%20Stone">Matt Stone</a> were the executive producers of the 13th season of "South Park", along with Anne Garefino. The season was distributed by <a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a>, where the series has aired since its inception in 1997. Frank C. Agnone II served as supervising producer, while <a href="Eric%20Stough">Eric Stough</a>, <a href="Adrien%20Beard">Adrien Beard</a>, <a href="Vernon%20Chatman">Vernon Chatman</a>, Bruce Howell and Erica Rivinoja worked as producers. Parker also served as director and writer for the thirteenth season. "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" cast member <a href="Bill%20Hader">Bill Hader</a>, who had previously worked as a consultant on the show, was credited as a producer starting in season 13. Hader said of his role with the show, "It's really Trey and Matt who kind of write everything, and you're just in the room kind of helping them. Basically, I'm friends with them and they're just nice enough to invite me into the room and let me goof around." Ryan Quincy served as director of animation during the 13th season.

"South Park" was set to expire in 2008, but in August 2007 it was announced the series would be renewed for at least three more seasons, extending it through 2011. The new seasons, 13, <a href="South%20Park%20%28season%2014%29">14</a> and <a href="South%20Park%20%28season%2015%29">15</a>, were each to consist of 14 episodes. Stone said of the announcement, "Three more years of "South Park" will give us the opportunity to offend that many more people." Parker and Stone also announced they would partner with Comedy Central to create a Los Angeles–based digital animation studio called South Park Digital Studios, which would serve as the center for all digital extensions of the "South Park" franchise and other animated projects.

Prior to the broadcast of the 13th season, Parker and Stone made every episode from the previous 12 seasons of "South Park" available for free viewing on the official series website, "South Park Studios". New episodes from the 13th season were made available for one week after the original airdate, then removed for 30 days, after which they were returned to the site permanently. The episodes were uncensored and ad-supported, so no membership fees were required to view the shows. In a statement, Parker and Stone said, "We got really sick of having to download our own show illegally all the time. So we gave ourselves a legal alternative."

Two months before the 13th season premiered, "South Park Studios" announced that it would be the first season to be broadcast in <a href="high-definition%20television">high definition</a> and presented in widescreen. Episodes from previous seasons were also converted to high definition. The season's episodes first aired in the United States on Wednesdays at 10 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern Standard Time</a> on Comedy Central, and were repeated Wednesdays at 12 a.m., Thursdays at 10 p.m. and 12 a.m., and Sundays at 11 p.m. and 2 a.m., all EST. The first seven episodes of the season aired from March 11, 2009, premiering with "<a href="The%20Ring%20%28South%20Park%29">The Ring</a>", and ended on April 22 with the mid-season finale "<a href="Fatbeard">Fatbeard</a>". The season returned with seven more episodes, resuming on October 7 with "<a href="Dead%20Celebrities">Dead Celebrities</a>", and ending on November 18 with the season finale, "<a href="Pee%20%28South%20Park%29">Pee</a>".

Continuing their practice from previous seasons, Parker and Stone wrote and produced each episode within the week before its broadcast date, although as in previous seasons, only Parker was listed as writer in the end credits. The duo conceived a list of episode ideas at the start of the season, but said they preferred to wait until the last minute to start working. Deadline pressure, they explained, energized them as if they were doing a live show. Stone said of the practice, "We kind of need that [chaos] to work. We're, like, 'We have to do something right now. It's going on the air in just a few minutes.'" For example, three days before the broadcast of the season premiere, "The Ring", the script was only half-finished and the animation was incomplete. Likewise, they did not start work on "Whale Whores" until five days before the episode aired, and the scripts for "<a href="Margaritaville%20%28South%20Park%29">Margaritaville</a>" and "Pee" were both still being finished the day before the episodes were first broadcast. Parker and Stone said "Dead Celebrities" was a particularly challenging episode to make—they were up all night working on it the day before it aired, and did not finish until 11 a.m. on its broadcast date. Some critics have said that this short turnaround process helps "South Park" stay fresh and allows the show to address current events in a timely fashion.

The 13th season introduced the characters Katie and Katherine, stars of a television show, "The Queef Sisters", that consists largely of <a href="vaginal%20flatulence">vaginal flatulence</a> jokes. They are female equivalents of long-time characters <a href="List%20of%20supporting%20characters%20on%20South%20Park%23Terrance%20and%20Phillip">Terrance and Phillip</a>, who are initially angered at the competition from Katie and Katherine, but end up romantically involved with them. Season 13 also marked the final appearance of long-time supporting character <a href="List%20of%20students%20at%20South%20Park%20Elementary%23Others">Gordon Stoltski</a>, the third grade student who read the morning announcements for South Park Elementary. In the episode "<a href="Dances%20with%20Smurfs">Dances with Smurfs</a>", Gordon is murdered while reading the announcements by a gunman who mistakes him for a truck driver who slept with his wife. Some critics found the scene disturbing and inappropriate in the light of recent school shootings in the United States.

The running gag of <a href="Kenny%20McCormick%23Deaths">killing protagonist Kenny McCormick</a> continued, though he was killed only three times during the season: in the episode "The Ring", he contracts syphilis after engaging in oral sex; in "W.T.F.", he is shot by a rocket launcher during a professional wrestling match; and in "Pee", he drowns in the urine that inundates the water park. During the final half of the season, aliens were hidden in images throughout the episodes as part of a contest offered by "South Park Studios". Viewers able to find the alien in the episode could enter a contest, with the grand winner getting an animated version of himself or herself placed in the "South Park" opening credits starting the next season. In December 2009, Matthew Klinner was announced winner of the contest.

The 13th season also continued a "South Park" tradition of lampooning celebrities and timely issues. The episode "Margaritaville" satirized the <a href="Late-2000s%20recession">global recession</a> affecting much of the industrialized world at the time of the episode's broadcast. Parker and Stone said they had long planned to do an episode about the recession, but did not want to rush it because they wanted to make sure the script was strong. "Fatbeard" was based on real-life <a href="piracy%20in%20Somalia">piracy in Somalia</a>, which began receiving increasing international media attention in 2008; the Somali pirates are portrayed in a sympathetic light in the episode. "Dances with Smurfs" parodied the political commentary of <a href="Glenn%20Beck">Glenn Beck</a>, a nationally syndicated radio show host and <a href="Fox%20News%20Channel">Fox News Channel</a> political pundit. In the episode, Cartman makes outrageous claims with no basis in fact under the guise that he is simply asking rhetorical questions and seeking further discussion, a practice for which Beck has been criticized.

The episode "<a href="Whale%20Whores">Whale Whores</a>" addressed the controversies surrounding <a href="Whaling%20in%20Japan">Japanese whaling</a>, condemning not only the whalers who engaged in the practice, but shows like "<a href="Whale%20Wars">Whale Wars</a>" and activists like television celebrity Paul Watson who profit from fighting whaling. "<a href="Butters%27%20Bottom%20Bitch">Butters' Bottom Bitch</a>" featured a scene in which <a href="Butters%20Stotch">Butters</a> visits an <a href="Association%20of%20Community%20Organizations%20for%20Reform%20Now">ACORN</a> office seeking benefits for prostitutes working for him, a reference to a similar <a href="ACORN%202009%20undercover%20videos%20controversy">2009 scandal</a>. The episode "<a href="Eat%2C%20Pray%2C%20Queef">Eat, Pray, Queef</a>" demonstrated a double standard between rights of men and women by showing the South Park men, who have no problem with farting, strongly objecting to vaginal flatulence from women. The season finale, "Pee", satirized the <a href="disaster%20film">disaster film</a> genre, especially the movie "<a href="2012%20%28film%29">2012</a>", which was released five days before the episode aired. Cartman interprets the large number of minorities at his favorite water park as a sign of the <a href="2012%20phenomenon">2012 phenomenon</a>, the prediction that cataclysmic events will occur in the year 2012, which is said to be the end of the <a href="Mesoamerican%20Long%20Count%20calendar">Mayan Long Count calendar</a>.

"The Ring" featured parodies of the pop-rock <a href="boy%20band">boy band</a> Jonas Brothers and a foul-mouthed, greedy, physically violent <a href="Mickey%20Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a>, satirizing the <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">Walt Disney Company</a>'s exploitation of family-friendly morals to disguise its profit motive. "<a href="The%20Coon">The Coon</a>" served as a parody of dark-toned comic book movies, like "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20%28film%29">The Dark Knight</a>" (2008), "<a href="The%20Spirit%20%28film%29">The Spirit</a>" (2008) and "<a href="Watchmen%20%28film%29">Watchmen</a>" (2009). "Dead Celebrities" mocked numerous recently deceased celebrities, including <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, <a href="Billy%20Mays">Billy Mays</a> and <a href="David%20Carradine">David Carradine</a>, as well as the show "<a href="Ghost%20Hunters%20%28TV%20series%29">Ghost Hunters</a>". "Dances with Smurfs" mocked the 2009 <a href="James%20Cameron">James Cameron</a> film "<a href="Avatar%20%282009%20film%29">Avatar</a>", suggesting the plot borrows heavily from the film "<a href="Dances%20with%20Wolves">Dances with Wolves</a>" and comparing Avatar's blue aliens to the cartoon <a href="The%20Smurfs">Smurfs</a>. The episode "<a href="W.T.F.%20%28South%20Park%29">W.T.F.</a>" parodied professional wrestling in general and <a href="World%20Wrestling%20Entertainment">World Wrestling Entertainment</a> in particular, highlighting the soap opera aspects of wrestling storylines and fans who believe the stories are real.

Several original songs written by Parker and Stone were featured in the 13th season. The episode "Fatbeard" features a song, "Somalian Pirates, We", in which Cartman and his crew of pirates sing in the style of the <a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Piracy">Golden Age of Piracy</a>. In response to fan requests, the full 90-second version of the song was made available for download on "South Park Studios" the week the episode aired. The season finale, "Pee", features a tune sung by Cartman, "(Too Many Minorities) Not My Water Park", in which he despairs over the large number of African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American patrons at his water park. Among other topics, Cartman expresses his anger about long lines full of minorities and park employees speaking Spanish rather than English. The episode "Eat, Pray, Queef" features "Queef Free", a charity single recorded by the men of "South Park" after they realize women should be free to queef just as men are free to fart. The song has been described as a parody of such celebrities-for-charity songs as "<a href="We%20Are%20The%20World">We Are The World</a>".

The 13th season also featured or spoofed real-life songs and bands. The episode "Fishsticks", which prominently featured rapper Kanye West, includes a two-and-a-half minute song, "Gay Fish", that parodies West's "<a href="Heartless%20%28Kanye%20West%20song%29">Heartless</a>". "Gay Fish" satirizes the rapper's tendency to rely on audio processing to correct his mistakes in <a href="Pitch%20%28music%29">pitch</a>. After "Fishsticks" aired, the full song was made available for download on "South Park Studios". Several fake Jonas Brothers songs, with lyrics about the band members' physical attractiveness, were written for "The Ring". Some songs also emphasize the band's belief in sexual abstinence, with lyrics like, "Who needs sex and drugs and partying when we can cook a meal and sit around and watch <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a>?" The strongly erotic reactions of the young girls at their concert parody the frenzied female fan reactions the Jonas Brothers tend to elicit, even though their image projects wholesomeness and chastity. In the episode "Whale Wars", Cartman plays the video game "<a href="Rock%20Band">Rock Band</a>" and performs a rendition, praised by critics, of the <a href="Lady%20Gaga">Lady Gaga</a> song "<a href="Poker%20Face%20%28Lady%20Gaga%20song%29">Poker Face</a>". On March 16, 2010, "Rock Band" developer <a href="Harmonix">Harmonix</a> released this version of the song (along with the original version) as downloadable content for the game. In "W.T.F.", during an audition for the boys' professional wrestling league, one of the participants sings a <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a>-style number—parodying the song "Nothing" from "<a href="A%20Chorus%20Line">A Chorus Line</a>"—about why he wants to be a wrestler. The episode "Fatbeard" received considerable press attention after Ike stated in a letter he would "vomit his balls out through his mouth" if he had to hear anything more about <a href="Susan%20Boyle">Susan Boyle</a>, the Scottish amateur singer who had recently gained worldwide attention for her performance of "<a href="I%20Dreamed%20a%20Dream">I Dreamed a Dream</a>" on "<a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent">Britain's Got Talent</a>".

Ramsey Isler of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> said "South Park" continued to be the "best animated comedy show on TV" during its 13th season. He said the season had some low points, particularly "Eat, Pray Queef", but that episodes like "The F Word" and "Dances with Smurfs" delivered significant social commentary. Isler described "Fishsticks" as a well-timed, hilarious episode that became a "phenomenon". Ben Flanagan of "The Tuscaloosa News" said the 13th season was one of the strongest yet for "South Park", and that the series continued its tradition of entertainingly combining gross-out comedy with social satire. He wrote, "Whether they tackle the Jonas Brothers, Somali pirates, Kanye West, "The Dark Knight", the current economic woes or just the frequent greed and foolishness of the human race, the show continues to solidify itself as not only the funniest show on TV, but the best."

Not all reviews of the season were positive. <a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">A.V. Club</a> writer Sean O'Neal called it "one of the more hit-or-miss seasons of "South Park" in the show’s history", but said he was confident the series could do better and that it had yet not entered the "staggering animal begging to be put out of its misery stage of a show's lifetime". He described the season as a "weekly exercise in "South Park" schizophrenia", with some episodes faring better than others, although he said the first half of the season was generally strong. Josh Modell, also of the A.V. Club, agreed that the season was uneven, with several episodes "you kinda shrugged your shoulders at", but others like "Butters' Bottom Bitch" that he found "pretty damn funny".

"Fishsticks" particularly attracted media attention, and some critics declared it one of the best episodes of the season. In the episode, Jimmy writes a joke that becomes a national sensation, while Cartman tries to steal the credit. A fictionalized version of rapper Kanye West fails to understand the joke. He cannot admit that he does not get it because, in reference to a perceived ego problem on the part of the real West, he considers himself a genius. On September 13, 2009, during the <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">MTV Video Music Awards</a>, West interrupted an acceptance speech by country singer <a href="Taylor%20Swift">Taylor Swift</a>, walking on stage, grabbing the microphone and praising her competitor <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9%20Knowles">Beyoncé Knowles</a>. The incident received considerable press coverage and, as a result, Comedy Central rebroadcast "Fishsticks" for two straight hours on September 15.

"The F Word" was especially controversial, even by "South Park" standards. In the episode, the South Park boys attempt to change the official definition of the word "<a href="faggot%20%28slang%29">fag</a>" from an <a href="homophobia">anti-homosexual</a> slur to a term describing loud and obnoxious <a href="Harley-Davidson">Harley</a> bikers. The uncensored word is voiced casually and very frequently throughout the episode. A.V. Club critic Genevieve Koski argued that "The F Word" advocates a philosophy that language is ever-changing and that <a href="taboo">taboo</a> words receive their stigma purely due to social circumstance. Although some <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> activists accepted that the episode had noble intentions, the <a href="Gay%20%26amp%3B%20Lesbian%20Alliance%20Against%20Defamation">Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation</a> nevertheless objected to it, claiming that it still used "fag" as a means of insulting others and could be unintentionally harmful to the gay community. Some critics praised the episode and said it addressed an important and difficult issue, whereas others felt the satire was ineffective and unfunny.

Some celebrities who were spoofed in 13th-season episodes responded to their portrayals. The day after "Fishsticks" aired, West wrote on his blog, "South Park murdered me last night and it's pretty damn funny. It hurts my feelings but what can you expect from South Park!" West thanked the "South Park" writers in his blog entry and acknowledged he has a problem with his ego, but said he was trying to change. The blog post drew substantial media attention; Daniel Kreps of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" said: "Many have tried, all have failed, but in the end it only took four animated children from Colorado to topple Kanye West's ego." <a href="Carlos%20Mencia">Carlos Mencia</a>, host of the Comedy Central show "<a href="Mind%20of%20Mencia">Mind of Mencia</a>", was also spoofed in "Fishsticks". He is portrayed as knowingly stealing credit for a joke he did not write, which is a reference to accusations other comedians have made that Mencia plagiarizes jokes from other people. After the episode aired, Mencia wrote on his <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> feed, "They just made fun of me on South Park. I thought it was hysterical. Catch the rerun."

In "The Coon", Butters suspects heavyset comedian <a href="Bruce%20Vilanch">Bruce Vilanch</a> is Cartman's superhero alter ego based on his physique. After the episode aired, Vilanch sent a card to Parker and Stone thanking them for referring to him. Shortly after "Whale Whores" aired, Paul Watson said he was not offended by his portrayal in the episode, and was glad "South Park" brought the issue of dolphin and whale slaughter, and the Japanese role in it, to a large audience. After Billy Mays appeared in "Dead Celebrities", his son Billy Mays III said he loved the episode and found its portrayal of his father tasteful and respectful. <a href="Jason%20Hawes">Jason Hawes</a> and <a href="Grant%20Wilson">Grant Wilson</a>, the stars of "<a href="Ghost%20Hunters%20%28TV%20series%29">Ghost Hunters</a>" who were also mocked in "Dead Celebrities", said they loved the parody and encouraged fans to watch the show on their Twitter accounts. The day after "Dances with Smurfs" originally aired, Glenn Beck discussed the episode on his <a href="Glenn%20Beck%20Program">radio program</a> and said he took the parody as a compliment. The Jonas Brothers' publicist specifically forbade reporters from asking the band members about their portrayal in "The Ring". Nevertheless, <a href="Nick%20Jonas">Nick Jonas</a> said, "We are always open to make fun of ourselves."

"Pinewood Derby" drew considerable media attention in Mexico when it first aired due to its depiction of Mexican President <a href="Felipe%20Calder%C3%B3n">Felipe Calderón</a>. The episode was due to air in Spanish on <a href="MTV%20Latin%20America">MTV Latin America</a> on February 8, 2010, but it was pulled a few hours before the scheduled time. Media reports indicated the decision stemmed from the episode's depiction of Calderón irritating the international community and frivolously spending alien-provided "space cash" on water parks. MTV said the "South Park" creators did not get a special permit needed to broadcast an image of Mexico's flag, but the explanation was met with skepticism by Mexican "South Park" fans, some of whom accused MTV of censorship.

"Fatbeard" included prominent references to the <a href="Maersk%20Alabama%20hijacking">April 2009 hijacking</a> of the <a href="MV%20Maersk%20Alabama">MV "Maersk Alabama"</a> by Somalian pirates. The crew of the <a href="USS%20Bainbridge%20%28DDG-96%29">USS "Bainbridge"</a>, the <a href="Arleigh%20Burke%20class%20destroyer">"Arleigh Burke"–class</a> guided-missile destroyer that participated in the rescue of <a href="Richard%20Phillips%20%28captain%29">Richard Phillips</a> from "Maersk Alabama", contacted the "South Park" creators to commend them on the episode. Ensign Jonathan Sieg, the "Bainbridge" public relations officer, wrote, "Pretty much everyone onboard our ship—from Captain to seaman—is a huge fan of "South Park", and when we heard about the episode 'Fatbeard', as you can imagine, we were thrilled and very interested to watch."

The 13th season of "South Park" generally maintained the average <a href="Nielsen%20rating">Nielsen rating</a> viewership for the series, around 3 million viewers per episode. The season premiere, "The Ring", was seen in 3.41 million households. That would prove to be the largest individual viewership for any Comedy Central show that season, outperforming even a highly anticipated and publicized episode of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Show">The Daily Show</a>" involving <a href="Jon%20Stewart%27s%202009%20criticism%20of%20CNBC">Jon Stewart's ongoing feud</a> with <a href="CNBC">CNBC</a> and pundit <a href="Jim%20Cramer">Jim Cramer</a>. The 13th season of "South Park" received its lowest viewership in the episodes "Dances with Smurfs", seen in 1.47 million households; "W.T.F.", seen in 1.37 million households; and "The F Word", seen in 1.99 million households. However, "The F Word" was the highest rated show of the season among viewers between ages 18 and 49, and outperformed "<a href="The%20Jay%20Leno%20Show">The Jay Leno Show</a>", <a href="NBC">NBC</a>'s primetime talk show. The season finale, "Pee", was seen in 2.87 million households, which made it the most watched cable show of the night. Likewise, "The Coon", seen in 3.27 million households, was the most watched cable program among ages 18 to 49 the week it aired. Several episodes from the 13th season of "South Park" were the most watched Comedy Central shows the week they aired, including "Margaritaville" (2.77 million households), "Fatbeard" (2.59 million households), "Eat, Pray, Queef" (3 million households) and "Fishsticks" (3.1 million households). The latter two episodes were watched by over 1 million more viewers than the network's second-highest-rated shows in their respective weeks.

Parker and Stone decided to submit "Margaritaville" for an <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a> because they had received a large amount of positive feedback about the episode from adult viewers. Since most Emmy voters are older, they decided "Margaritaville" stood the best chance of winning. Stone joked, "If an Emmy voter were to watch this, they might think the show was smarter than it was, so they might be fooled into voting for us." "Margaritaville" ultimately won the 2009 Emmy Award for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Animated%20Program%20%28for%20Programming%20Less%20Than%20One%20Hour%29">Outstanding Animated Program for Programming Less Than One Hour</a> against competing nominees "<a href="Robot%20Chicken">Robot Chicken</a>", "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" and "<a href="American%20Dad%21">American Dad!</a>". The victory marked the third consecutive Emmy win for "South Park", which won in the same category in 2007 for the <a href="South%20Park%20%28season%2010%29">10th season</a> episode "<a href="Make%20Love%2C%20Not%20Warcraft">Make Love, Not Warcraft</a>", and won the award for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Animated%20Program%20%28for%20Programming%20One%20Hour%20or%20More%29">Outstanding Animated Program for Programming One Hour or More</a> for the <a href="South%20Park%20%28season%2011%29">11th season</a> episode "<a href="Imaginationland%20Episode%20I">Imaginationland</a>". Parker, Stone, Agnone, Stough, Beard, Howell, Rivinoja, Chatman, Hader and Quincy were all recipients of the Emmy.

In February 2010, "Whale Whores" was nominated for a <a href="Genesis%20Awards">Genesis Award</a> in the television comedy category. The Genesis Awards honor news and entertainment media for outstanding work that raises public understanding of animal issues. "Whale Whores" ultimately lost to the "<a href="Family%20Guy">Family Guy</a>" episode "<a href="Dog%20Gone">Dog Gone</a>."

The season was released by <a href="Paramount%20Pictures%23Paramount%20Home%20Entertainment">Paramount Home Entertainment</a> in the United States on March 16, 2010, on both <a href="DVD">DVD</a> (as a three-disc set) and <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray</a> (as a two-disc set). Each set included all 14 uncensored episodes in <a href="1080p">1080p</a> video and <a href="Dolby%20TrueHD">Dolby TrueHD</a> sound, as well as brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode, seven deleted scenes, codes for unlocking a character and challenge levels in "<a href="South%20Park%20Let%27s%20Go%20Tower%20Defense%20Play%21">South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!</a>" on <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Arcade">Xbox Live Arcade</a>, and a special mini-feature, "Inside Xbox: A Behind-the-Scenes Tour of South Park Studios", describing the show's animation process.

George S. Patton slapping incidents

In early August 1943, <a href="US%20Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="George%20S.%20Patton">George S. Patton</a> slapped two <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> soldiers under his command during the <a href="Sicily%20Campaign">Sicily Campaign</a> of World War II. Patton's hard-driving personality and lack of belief in the medical condition <a href="combat%20stress%20reaction">combat stress reaction</a>, then known as "battle fatigue" or "<a href="shell%20shock">shell shock</a>", led to the soldiers becoming the subject of his ire in incidents on 3 and 10 August, when Patton struck and berated them after discovering they were patients at evacuation hospitals away from the front lines without apparent physical injuries.

Word of the incidents spread, eventually reaching Patton's superior, General <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, who ordered him to apologize to the men. Patton's actions were initially suppressed in the news until journalist <a href="Drew%20Pearson%20%28journalist%29">Drew Pearson</a> publicized them in the United States. While the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a> and the general public expressed both support and disdain for Patton's actions, Eisenhower and <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">Army Chief of Staff</a> <a href="George%20Marshall">George Marshall</a> opted not to fire Patton as a commander. He was nonetheless sidelined from combat command for almost a year.

Seizing the opportunity the predicament presented, Eisenhower used Patton as a decoy in <a href="Operation%20Fortitude">Operation Fortitude</a>, sending faulty intelligence to German agents that Patton was leading the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Europe">Invasion of Europe</a>. While Patton eventually returned to combat command in the <a href="European%20Theater">European Theater</a> in mid-1944, the slapping incidents were seen by Eisenhower, Marshall, and other leaders to be examples of Patton's brashness and impulsiveness. Patton's career was halted as former subordinates such as <a href="Omar%20Bradley">Omar Bradley</a> became his superiors.

The <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a> began on 10 July 1943, with Lieutenant General George S. Patton leading 90,000 men of the <a href="Seventh%20United%20States%20Army">Seventh United States Army</a> in a landing near <a href="Gela">Gela</a>, <a href="Scoglitti">Scoglitti</a>, and <a href="Licata">Licata</a> to support <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery">Bernard Montgomery</a>'s <a href="British%208th%20Army">British 8th Army</a> landings to the north. Initially ordered to protect the British forces' flank, Patton took <a href="Palermo">Palermo</a> after Montgomery's forces were slowed by heavy resistance from troops of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Kingdom of Italy</a>. Patton then set his sights on <a href="Messina">Messina</a>. He sought an <a href="amphibious%20assault">amphibious assault</a>, but it was delayed by lack of landing craft and his troops did not land in <a href="Santo%20Stefano%20Island">Santo Stefano</a> until 8 August, by which time the Germans and Italians had already evacuated the bulk of their troops to mainland Italy. Throughout the campaign, Patton's troops were heavily engaged by German and Italian forces as they pushed across the island.

Patton had already developed a reputation in the U.S. Army as an effective, successful, and hard-driving commander, punishing subordinates for the slightest infractions but also rewarding them when they performed well. As a way to promote an image that inspired his troops, Patton created a larger-than-life personality. He became known for his flashy dress, highly polished helmet and boots, and no-nonsense demeanor. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the commander of the Sicily operation and Patton's friend and commanding officer, had long known of Patton's colorful leadership style, and also knew that Patton was prone to impulsiveness and a lack of self-restraint.

Prior to World War I, the U.S. Army considered the symptoms of battle fatigue to be cowardice or attempts to avoid combat duty. Soldiers who reported these symptoms received harsh treatment. At the time of the incidents, the two soldiers Patton slapped were believed to be suffering from "battle fatigue," otherwise known as "<a href="shell%20shock">shell shock</a>" or "battle stress." Today, this condition is characterized as a form of <a href="post-traumatic%20stress%20disorder">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, which can result from prolonged severe exposure to death and destruction, among many other traumatic events. While the causes, symptoms, and effects of the condition were familiar to physicians by the time of the two incidents, it was generally less understood in military circles.

An important lesson from the <a href="Tunisia%20Campaign">Tunisia Campaign</a> was that <a href="neuropsychiatric">neuropsychiatric</a> casualties had to be treated as soon as possible and not evacuated from the combat zone. This was not done in the early stages of the Sicilian Campaign, and large numbers of neuropsychiatric casualties were evacuated to North Africa, with the result that treatment became complicated and only 15 percent of them were returned to duty. As the campaign wore on, the system became better organized and nearly 50 percent were restored to combat duty.

Some time before what would become known as the "slapping incident," Patton spoke with <a href="US%20Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="Clarence%20R.%20Huebner">Clarence R. Huebner</a>, the newly appointed commander of the <a href="U.S.%201st%20Infantry%20Division">U.S. 1st Infantry Division</a>, in which the soldiers both served. Patton had asked Huebner for a status report; Huebner replied: "The front lines seem to be thinning out. There seems to be a very large number of '<a href="malingerers">malingerers</a>' at the hospitals, feigning illness in order to avoid combat duty." For his part, Patton did not believe the condition was real. In a directive issued to commanders on 5 August, he forbade "battle fatigue" in the Seventh Army:

Private Charles H. Kuhl, of L Company, <a href="U.S.%2026th%20Infantry%20Regiment">U.S. 26th Infantry Regiment</a>, reported to an aid station of C Company, 1st Medical Battalion, on 2 August 1943. Kuhl, who had been in the U.S. Army for eight months, had been attached to the 1st Infantry Division since 2 June 1943. He was diagnosed with "exhaustion," a diagnosis he had been given three times since the start of the campaign. From the aid station, he was evacuated to a medical company and given <a href="sodium%20amytal">sodium amytal</a>. Notes in his medical chart indicated "<a href="psychoneurosis">psychoneurosis</a> anxiety state, moderately severe (soldier has been twice before in hospital within ten days. He can't take it at the front, evidently. He is repeatedly returned.)" Kuhl was transferred from the aid station to the 15th Evacuation Hospital near <a href="Nicosia%2C%20Sicily">Nicosia</a> for further evaluation.

Patton arrived at the hospital the same day, accompanied by a number of medical officers, as part of his tour of the <a href="U.S.%20II%20Corps">U.S. II Corps</a> troops. He spoke to some patients in the hospital, commending the physically wounded. He then approached Kuhl, who did not appear to be physically injured. Kuhl was sitting slouched on a stool midway through a tent ward filled with injured soldiers. When Patton asked Kuhl where he was hurt, Kuhl reportedly shrugged and replied that he was "nervous" rather than wounded, adding, "I guess I can't take it." Patton "immediately flared up," slapped Kuhl across the chin with his gloves, then grabbed him by the collar and dragged him to the tent entrance. He shoved him out of the tent with a kick to his backside. Yelling "Don't admit this son of a bitch," Patton demanded that Kuhl be sent back to the front, adding, "You hear me, you gutless bastard? You're going back to the front."

Corpsmen picked up Kuhl and brought him to a ward tent, where it was discovered he had a temperature of ; and was later diagnosed with <a href="malarial%20parasite">malarial parasite</a>s. Speaking later of the incident, Kuhl noted "at the time it happened, [Patton] was pretty well worn out  ... I think he was suffering a little battle fatigue himself." Kuhl wrote to his parents about the incident, but asked them to "just forget about it." That night, Patton recorded the incident in his diary: "[I met] the only errant coward I have ever seen in this Army. Companies should deal with such men, and if they shirk their duty, they should be tried for cowardice and shot."

Patton was accompanied in this visit by Major General <a href="John%20P.%20Lucas">John P. Lucas</a>, who saw nothing remarkable about the incident. After the war he wrote:

Patton was heard by a war correspondent angrily denying the reality of shell shock, claiming that the condition was "an invention of the Jews."

Private Paul G. Bennett, 21, of C Battery, <a href="U.S.%2017th%20Field%20Artillery%20Regiment">U.S. 17th Field Artillery Regiment</a>, was a four-year veteran of the U.S. Army, and had served in the division since March 1943. Records show he had no medical history until 6 August 1943, when a friend was wounded in combat. According to a report, he "could not sleep and was nervous." Bennett was brought to the 93rd Evacuation Hospital. In addition to having a fever, he exhibited symptoms of dehydration, including fatigue, confusion, and listlessness. His request to return to his unit was turned down by medical officers.

On 10 August, Patton entered the receiving tent of the hospital, speaking to the injured there. Patton approached Bennett, who was huddled and shivering, and asked what the trouble was. "It's my nerves," Bennett responded. "I can't stand the shelling anymore." Patton reportedly became enraged at him, slapping him across the face. He began yelling: "Your nerves, hell, you are just a goddamned coward. Shut up that goddamned crying. I won't have these brave men who have been shot at seeing this yellow bastard sitting here crying." Patton then reportedly slapped Bennett again, knocking his helmet liner off, and ordered the receiving officer, <a href="US%20Major">Major</a> Charles B. Etter, not to admit him. Patton then threatened Bennett, "You're going back to the front lines and you may get shot and killed, but you're going to fight. If you don't, I'll stand you up against a wall and have a firing squad kill you on purpose. In fact, I ought to shoot you myself, you goddamned whimpering coward." Upon saying this, Patton pulled out his pistol threateningly, prompting the hospital's commander, Colonel Donald E. Currier, to physically separate the two. Patton left the tent, yelling to medical officers to send Bennett back to the front lines.

As he toured the remainder of the hospital, Patton continued discussing Bennett's condition with Currier. Patton stated, "I can't help it, it makes my blood boil to think of a yellow bastard being babied," and "I won't have those cowardly bastards hanging around our hospitals. We'll probably have to shoot them some time anyway, or we'll raise a breed of morons."

The 10 August incident—particularly the sight of Patton threatening a subordinate with a pistol—upset many of the medical staff present. The II Corps surgeon, Colonel Richard T. Arnest, submitted a report on the incident to Brigadier General <a href="William%20B.%20Kean">William B. Kean</a>, chief of staff of II Corps, who submitted it to Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, commander of II Corps. Bradley, out of loyalty to Patton, did nothing more than lock the report in his safe. Arnest also sent the report through medical channels to Brigadier General Frederick A. Blesse, General Surgeon of <a href="Allied%20Force%20Headquarters">Allied Force Headquarters</a>, who then submitted it to Eisenhower, who received it on 16 August. Eisenhower ordered Blesse to proceed immediately to Patton's command to ascertain the truth of the allegations. Eisenhower also formulated a delegation to investigate the incidents from the soldiers' points of view, including Major General <a href="John%20P.%20Lucas">John P. Lucas</a>, two colonels from the <a href="Inspector%20General">Inspector General</a>'s office, and a theater medical consultant, <a href="US%20Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Perrin H. Long, to investigate the incident and interview those involved. Long interviewed medical personnel who witnessed each incident, then filed a report entitled "Mistreatment of Patients in Receiving Tents of the 15th and 93rd Evacuation Hospitals" which extensively detailed Patton's actions at both hospitals.

By 18 August, Eisenhower had ordered that Patton's Seventh Army be broken up, with a few of its units remaining garrisoned in Sicily. The majority of its combat forces would be transferred to the <a href="Fifth%20United%20States%20Army">Fifth United States Army</a> under Lieutenant General <a href="Mark%20W.%20Clark">Mark W. Clark</a>. This had already been planned by Eisenhower, who had previously told Patton that his Seventh Army would not be part of the upcoming <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Italy">Allied invasion of Italy</a>, scheduled for September. On 20 August, Patton received a cable from Eisenhower regarding the arrival of Lucas at Palermo. Eisenhower told Patton it was "highly important" that he personally meet with Lucas as soon as possible, as Lucas would be carrying an important message. Before Lucas arrived, Blesse arrived from <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a> to look into the health of the troops in Sicily. He was also ordered by Eisenhower to deliver a secret letter to Patton and investigate its allegations. In the letter, Eisenhower told Patton he had been informed of the slapping incidents. He said he would not be opening a formal investigation into the matter, but his criticism of Patton was sharp.

Eisenhower noted that no formal record of the incidents would be retained at Allied Headquarters, save in his own secret files. Still, he strongly suggested Patton apologize to all involved. On 21 August, Patton brought Bennett into his office; he apologized and the men shook hands. On 22 August, he met with Currier as well as the medical staff who had witnessed the events in each unit and expressed regret for his "impulsive actions." Patton related to the medical staff a story of a friend from World War I who had committed <a href="suicide">suicide</a> after "skulking"; he stated he sought to prevent any recurrence of such an event. On 23 August, he brought Kuhl into his office, apologized, and shook hands with him as well. After the apology, Kuhl said he thought Patton was "a great general," and that "at the time, he didn't know how sick I was." Currier later said Patton's remarks sounded like "no apology at all, an attempt to justify what he had done." Patton wrote in his diary that he loathed making the apologies, particularly when he was told by Bennett's brigade commander, Brigadier General John A. Crane, that Bennett had gone <a href="AWOL">absent without leave (AWOL)</a> and arrived at the hospital by "falsely representing his condition." Patton wrote, "It is rather a commentary on justice when an Army commander has to soft-soap a skulker to placate the timidity of those above." As word of the actions had spread informally among troops of the Seventh Army, Patton drove to each <a href="division%20%28military%29">division</a> under his command between 24 and 30 August and gave a 15-minute speech in which he praised their behavior and apologized for any instances where he had been too harsh on soldiers, making only vague reference to the two slapping incidents. In his final apology speech to the <a href="U.S.%203rd%20Infantry%20Division">U.S. 3rd Infantry Division</a>, Patton was overcome with emotion when the soldiers supportively began to chant "No, general, no, no," to prevent him from having to apologize.

In a letter to General George Marshall on 24 August, Eisenhower praised Patton's exploits as commander of the Seventh Army and his conduct of the Sicily campaign, particularly his ability to take initiative as a commander. Still, Eisenhower noted Patton continued "to exhibit some of those unfortunate traits of which you and I have always known." He informed Marshall of the two incidents and his requirement that Patton apologize. Eisenhower stated he believed Patton would cease his behavior "because fundamentally, he is so avid for recognition as a great military commander that he will ruthlessly suppress any habit of his that will tend to jeopardize it." When Eisenhower arrived in Sicily to award Montgomery the <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a> on 29 August, Patton gave him a letter expressing his remorse about the incidents.

Word of the slapping incidents spread informally among soldiers before eventually circulating to <a href="war%20correspondent">war correspondent</a>s. One of the nurses who witnessed the 10 August incident apparently told her boyfriend, a captain in the Seventh Army <a href="Public%20affairs%20%28military%29">public affairs</a> detachment. Through him, a group of four journalists covering the Sicily operation heard of the incident: Demaree Bess of the "<a href="Saturday%20Evening%20Post">Saturday Evening Post</a>", <a href="Merrill%20Mueller">Merrill Mueller</a> of <a href="NBC%20News">NBC News</a>, Al Newman of "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>", and <a href="John%20Charles%20Daly">John Charles Daly</a> of <a href="CBS%20News">CBS News</a>. The four journalists interviewed Etter and other witnesses, but decided to bring the matter to Eisenhower instead of filing the story with their editors. Bess, Mueller, and <a href="Quentin%20Reynolds">Quentin Reynolds</a> of "<a href="Collier%27s%20Magazine">Collier's Magazine</a>" flew from Sicily to Algiers, and on 19 August Bess gave a summary on the slapping incidents to Eisenhower's <a href="chief%20of%20staff">chief of staff</a>, Major General <a href="Walter%20Bedell%20Smith">Walter Bedell Smith</a>. The reporters asked Eisenhower directly about the incident, and Eisenhower requested that the story be suppressed because the war effort could not afford to lose Patton. Bess and other journalists initially complied. However, the news reporters then demanded Eisenhower fire Patton in exchange for them not reporting the story, a demand which Eisenhower refused.

The story of Kuhl's slapping broke in the U.S. when newspaper columnist <a href="Drew%20Pearson%20%28journalist%29">Drew Pearson</a> revealed it on his 21 November radio program. Pearson received details of the Kuhl incident and other material on Patton from his friend <a href="Ernest%20Cuneo">Ernest Cuneo</a>, an official with the <a href="Office%20of%20Strategic%20Services">Office of Strategic Services</a>, who obtained the information from War Department files and correspondence. Pearson's version not only conflated details of both slapping incidents but falsely reported that the private in question was visibly "out of his head," telling Patton to "duck down or the shells would hit him" and that in response "Patton struck the soldier, knocking him down." Pearson punctuated his broadcast by twice stating that Patton would never again be used in combat, despite the fact that Pearson had no factual basis for this prediction. In response, Allied Headquarters denied that Patton had received an official reprimand, but confirmed that Patton had slapped at least one soldier.

Patton's wife, Beatrice Patton, spoke to the media to defend him. She appeared in "<a href="True%20Confessions%20%28magazine%29">True Confessions</a>", a women's <a href="confession%20magazine">confession magazine</a>, where she characterized Patton as "the toughest, most hard boiled General in the U.S. Army  ... but he's quite sweet, really." She was featured in a "<a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" article on 26 November. While she did not attempt to justify Patton's action, she characterized him as a "tough perfectionist," stating that he cared deeply about the men under his command and would not ask them to do something he would not do himself:

Demands for Patton to be relieved of duty and sent home were made in Congress and in newspapers across the country. <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. Representative</a> <a href="Jed%20Johnson%20%28Oklahoma%29">Jed Johnson</a> of <a href="Oklahoma%27s%206th%20congressional%20district">Oklahoma's 6th district</a> described Patton's actions as a "despicable incident" and was "amazed and chagrined" Patton was still in command. He called for the general's immediate dismissal on the grounds that his actions rendered him no longer useful to the war effort. Representative <a href="Charles%20B.%20Hoeven">Charles B. Hoeven</a> of <a href="Iowa%27s%209th%20congressional%20district">Iowa's 9th district</a> said on the House floor that parents of soldiers need no longer worry of their children being abused by "hard boiled officers." He wondered whether the Army had "too much blood and guts." Eisenhower submitted a report to Secretary of War <a href="Henry%20L.%20Stimson">Henry L. Stimson</a>, who presented it to Senator <a href="Robert%20R.%20Reynolds">Robert R. Reynolds</a>, Chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">Senate Committee on Military Affairs</a>. The report laid out Eisenhower's response to the incident and gave details of Patton's decades of military service. Eisenhower concluded that Patton was invaluable to the war effort and that he was confident the corrective actions taken would be adequate. Investigators Eisenhower sent to Patton's command found the general remained overwhelmingly popular with his troops.

By mid-December, the government had received around 1,500 letters related to Patton, with many calling for his dismissal and others defending him or calling for his promotion. Kuhl's father, Herman F. Kuhl, wrote to his own congressman, stating that he forgave Patton for the incident and requesting that he not be disciplined. Retired generals also weighed in on the matter. Former Army Chief of Staff <a href="Charles%20P.%20Summerall">Charles P. Summerall</a> wrote to Patton that he was "indignant about the publicity given a trifling incident," adding that "whatever [Patton] did" he was sure it was "justified by the provocation. Such cowards used to be shot, now they are only encouraged." Major General <a href="Kenyon%20A.%20Joyce">Kenyon A. Joyce</a>, another combat commander and one of Patton's friends, attacked Pearson as a "sensation mongerer," stating that "niceties" should be left for "softer times of peace." In one notable dissension, Patton's friend, former mentor and <a href="General%20of%20the%20Armies">General of the Armies</a> <a href="John%20J.%20Pershing">John J. Pershing</a> publicly condemned his actions, an act that left Patton "deeply hurt" and caused him to never speak to Pershing again.

After consulting with Marshall, Stimson, and Assistant Secretary of War <a href="John%20J.%20McCloy">John J. McCloy</a>, Eisenhower retained Patton in the European theater, though his Seventh Army saw no further combat. Patton remained in Sicily for the rest of the year. Marshall and Stimson not only supported Eisenhower's decision, but defended it. In a letter to the <a href="U.S.%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a>, Stimson stated that Patton must be retained because of the need for his "aggressive, winning leadership in the bitter battles which are to come before final victory." Stimson acknowledged retaining Patton was a poor move for public relations but remained confident it was the right decision militarily.

Contrary to his statements to Patton, Eisenhower never seriously considered removing the general from duty in the European Theater. Writing of the incident before the media attention, he said, "If this thing ever gets out, they'll be howling for Patton's scalp, and that will be the end of Georgie's service in this war. I simply cannot let that happen. Patton is indispensable to the war effort – one of the guarantors of our victory." Still, following the capture of Messina in August 1943, Patton did not command a force in combat for 11 months.
Patton was passed over to lead the invasion in northern Europe. In September, Bradley—Patton's junior in both rank and experience—was selected to command the <a href="First%20United%20States%20Army">First United States Army</a> that was forming in <a href="United%20Kingdom">England</a> to prepare for <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Operation Overlord</a>. According to Eisenhower, this decision had been made months before the slapping incidents became public knowledge, but Patton felt they were the reason he was denied the command. Eisenhower had already decided on Bradley because he felt the invasion of Europe was too important to risk any uncertainty. While Eisenhower and Marshall both considered Patton to be a superb corps-level combat commander, Bradley possessed two of the traits that a <a href="theater%20%28warfare%29">theater</a>-level strategic command required, and that Patton conspicuously lacked: a calm, reasoned demeanor, and a meticulously consistent nature. The slapping incidents had only further confirmed to Eisenhower that Patton lacked the ability to exercise discipline and self-control at such a command level. Still, Eisenhower re-emphasized his confidence in Patton's skill as a ground combat commander by recommending him for promotion to <a href="four-star%20general">four-star general</a> in a private letter to Marshall on 8 September, noting his previous combat exploits and admitting that he had a "driving power" that Bradley lacked.

By mid-December, Eisenhower had been appointed <a href="Supreme%20Allied%20Commander">Supreme Allied Commander</a> in Europe and moved to England. As media attention surrounding the incident began to subside, McCloy told Patton he would indeed be eventually returning to combat command. Patton was briefly considered to lead the Seventh Army in <a href="Operation%20Dragoon">Operation Dragoon</a>, but Eisenhower felt his experience would be more useful in the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Normandy">Normandy campaign</a>. Eisenhower and Marshall privately agreed that Patton would command a follow-on <a href="field%20army">field army</a> after Bradley's army conducted the initial invasion of Normandy; Bradley would then command the resulting <a href="army%20group">army group</a>. Patton was told on 1 January 1944 only that he would be relieved of command of the Seventh Army and moved to Europe. In his diary, he wrote that he would resign if he was not given command of a field army. On 26 January 1944, formally given command of a newly arrived unit, the <a href="Third%20United%20States%20Army">Third United States Army</a>, he went to the United Kingdom to prepare the unit's inexperienced soldiers for combat. This duty occupied Patton throughout early 1944.

Exploiting Patton's situation, Eisenhower sent him on several high-profile trips throughout the Mediterranean in late 1943. He traveled to Algiers, <a href="Tunis">Tunis</a>, <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a>, <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, and <a href="Malta">Malta</a> in an effort to confuse German commanders as to where the Allied forces might next attack. By the next year, the <a href="Oberkommando%20der%20Wehrmacht">German High Command</a> still had more respect for Patton than for any other Allied commander and considered him central to any plan to invade Europe from the north. Because of this, Patton was made a central figure in <a href="Operation%20Fortitude">Operation Fortitude</a> in early 1944. The Allies fed the German intelligence organizations, through double agents, a steady stream of false intelligence that Patton had been named commander of the <a href="First%20United%20States%20Army%20Group">First United States Army Group</a> (FUSAG) and was preparing for an invasion of <a href="Pas%20de%20Calais">Pas de Calais</a>. The FUSAG command was actually an intricately constructed "phantom" army of decoys, props and radio signals based around southeast England to mislead German aircraft and to make Axis leaders believe a large force was massing there. Patton was ordered to keep a low profile to deceive the Germans into thinking he was in Dover throughout early 1944, when he was actually training the Third Army. As a result of Operation Fortitude, the <a href="15th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German 15th Army</a> remained at Pas de Calais to defend against the expected attack. The formation remained there even after the invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944. Patton and the Third Army traveled to Europe and entered combat in July.

Coprinellus micaceus

Coprinellus micaceus is a common species of <a href="fungus">fungus</a> in the family <a href="Psathyrellaceae">Psathyrellaceae</a> with a <a href="cosmopolitan%20distribution">cosmopolitan distribution</a>. The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> of the <a href="saprobe">saprobe</a> typically grow in clusters on or near rotting <a href="hardwood">hardwood</a> tree stumps or underground tree roots. Depending on their stage of development, the <a href="tawny%20%28color%29">tawny</a>-brown mushroom <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a> may range in shape from oval to bell-shaped to convex, and reach diameters up to . The caps, marked with fine radial grooves that extend nearly to the center, rest atop whitish <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stems</a> up to long. In young specimens, the entire cap surface is coated with a fine layer of reflective <a href="mica">mica</a>-like cells that provide the inspiration for both the mushroom's <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">species name</a> and the <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s mica cap, shiny cap, and glistening inky cap. Although small and with thin <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a>, the mushrooms are usually bountiful, as they typically grow in dense clusters. A few hours after collection, the <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> will begin to slowly dissolve into a black, inky, <a href="spore">spore</a>-laden liquid—an <a href="enzyme">enzymatic</a> process called "autodigestion" or "deliquescence". The fruit bodies are <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> before the gills blacken and dissolve, and cooking will stop the autodigestion process.

The microscopic characteristics and <a href="cytogenetics">cytogenetics</a> of "C. micaceus" are well known, and it has been used frequently as a <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a> to study <a href="cell%20division">cell division</a> and <a href="meiosis">meiosis</a> in <a href="Basidiomycetes">Basidiomycetes</a>. <a href="Chemical%20analysis">Chemical analysis</a> of the fruit bodies has revealed the presence of <a href="antibacterial">antibacterial</a> and <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>-inhibiting compounds. Formerly known as "Coprinus micaceus", the species was transferred to "<a href="Coprinellus">Coprinellus</a>" in 2001 as <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> analyses provided the impetus for a reorganization of the many species formerly grouped together in the genus "<a href="Coprinus">Coprinus</a>". Based on external appearance, "C. micaceus" is virtually indistinguishable from "<a href="Coprinellus%20truncorum">C. truncorum</a>", and it has been suggested that many reported collections of the former may be of the latter.

"Coprinellus micaeus" was illustrated in a <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a> by the 16th-century botanist <a href="Carolus%20Clusius">Carolus Clusius</a> in what is arguably the first published <a href="monograph">monograph</a> on fungi, the 1601 "Rariorum plantarum historia. Fungorum in Pannoniis observatorum brevis historia" (History of rare plants. Brief history of fungi observed in Pannonia [Hungary]). Clusius erroneously believed the species to be poisonous, and classified it as a genus of "Fungi perniciales" (harmful fungi). The species was first described scientifically by French botanist <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pierre%20Bulliard">Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard</a> in 1786 as "Agaricus micaceus" in his work "Herbier de la France". In 1801, <a href="Christian%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christian Hendrik Persoon</a> grouped together all of the gilled fungi that auto-digested ("deliquesced") during spore discharge into the <a href="section%20%28biology%29">section</a> "Coprinus" of the genus "Agaricus". <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a> later raised Persoon's section "Coprinus" to genus rank in his "Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici", and the species became known as "Coprinus micaceus". It was the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of subsection "Exannulati" in <a href="section%20%28biology%29">section</a> "Micacei" of the genus "Coprinus", a grouping of related <a href="taxon">taxa</a> with <a href="partial%20veil">veils</a> made of sphaerocysts (round swollen cells usually formed in clusters) exclusively or with thin-filamentous connective <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e intermixed. <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Molecular</a> studies published in the 1990s demonstrated that many of the <a href="coprinoid%20fungi">coprinoid</a> ("Coprinus"-like) mushrooms were in fact unrelated to each other. This culminated in a 2001 revision of the genus "<a href="Coprinus">Coprinus</a>", which was split into four genera; "C. micaeus" was transferred to "<a href="Coprinellus">Coprinellus</a>".

Due partly to their ready availability and the ease with which they may be grown in the laboratory, "C. micaceus" and other coprinoid mushrooms were common subjects in <a href="cell%20biology">cytological</a> studies of the 19th and 20th centuries. The German botanist <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20Friedrich%20Link">Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link</a> reported his observations of the structure of the <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a> (the fertile <a href="spore">spore</a>-bearing surface) in 1809, but misinterpreted what he had seen. Link thought that microscopic structures known today as <a href="basidia">basidia</a> were "thecae", comparable in form to the <a href="ascus">asci</a> of the <a href="Ascomycetes">Ascomycetes</a>, and that each theca contained four series of spores. His inaccurate drawings of the hymenium of "C. micaceus" were copied in subsequent <a href="mycology">mycological</a> publications by other authors, and it was not until microscopy had advanced that mycologists were able to determine the true nature of the basidia, when nearly three decades later in 1837 <a href="Joseph-Henri%20L%C3%A9veill%C3%A9">Joseph-Henri Léveillé</a> and <a href="August%20Karl%20Joseph%20Corda">August Corda</a> independently published correct descriptions of the structure of the hymenium. In 1924, <a href="A.%20H.%20Reginald%20Buller">A. H. Reginald Buller</a> published a comprehensive description and analysis of the processes of spore production and release in the third volume of his "Researches on Fungi".

The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "micaceus" is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word "mica", for "crumb, grain of salt" and the suffix -"aceus", "like, similar"; the modern application of "mica" to <a href="mica">a very different substance</a> comes from the influence of "micare", "glitter". The mushroom is <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the "shiny cap", the "mica cap" or the "glistening inky cap", all in reference to the mealy particles found on the cap that glisten like <a href="mica">mica</a>.

The <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> is initially in diameter, oval to cylindrical, but expands to become <a href="wikt%3Acampanulate">campanulate</a> (bell-shaped), sometimes with an <a href="umbo%20%28mycology%29">umbo</a> (a central nipple-like protrusion); finally it flattens somewhat, becoming convex. When expanded, the cap diameter reaches with the margin torn into rays and turned upwards slightly. The color is yellow-brown or tan often with a darker center, then pale yellow or <a href="buff%20%28color%29">buff</a> from the margin inwards. The cap margin is prominently grooved almost all the way to the center; the grooves mark the positions of the longer <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> on the underside of the cap. When young, the cap surface is covered with white or whitish shiny particles, remnants of the <a href="universal%20veil">universal veil</a> that covers immature specimens. The particles are loosely attached and easily washed away, so that older specimens are often smooth. "Coprinellus micaceus" is <a href="hygrophanous">hygrophanous</a>, meaning it assumes different colors depending on its state of hydration.

The gills are crowded together closely, and have an <a href="wikt%3Aadnexed">adnexed</a> (narrow) attachment to the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a>. Initially white, they change color to dark brown then eventually black as the spores mature. Expansion of the cap causes the gills to split open down their median planes, tearing the cap margin into rays. The process of spore discharge and autodigestion begin at the bottom of the gills before the upper parts of the gills have become completely blackened. The brittle stem is hollow, and measures long by thick and is roughly the same diameter throughout the length of the stem. It is generally white, but may discolor to pale dirty cream from the base up. The stem surface is at first velvety with a very fine whitish powder, but this eventually wears off, leaving it more or less smooth. Stems may have a rudimentary ring at the base, another universal veil remnant. The <a href="spore%20deposit">spore print</a> is dark brown or black. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is thin, fragile, white in the stem, and brownish in the cap. Its odor and taste are not distinctive. Individual fruit bodies take an average of five to seven days to fully mature.

The <a href="basidiospores">spores</a> of "C. micaceus" are reddish-brown, with dimensions of 7–10 by 4.5–6 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>. Generally, they are <a href="wikt%3Alentiform">lentiform</a> (shaped like a biconvex lens), but viewed from the side they appear more almond-shaped or spindle-shaped, while in front view they appear oval or mitriform (roughly the shape of a miter—a peaked cap). Spores have a <a href="germ%20pore">germ pore</a>, a flattened area in the center of the spore surface through which a <a href="germ%20tube">germ tube</a> may emerge. The spore-bearing cells (the <a href="basidia">basidia</a>) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 10–15 by 4–7 µm. Studies have shown that the basidia develop in four discrete generations. The first generation basidia are the most protuberant, and extend out the greatest distance from the surface of the hymenium. Subsequent generations of basidia have shorter and less protuberant bodies. When a living gill is viewed with a microscope, the four sets of basidia can be seen distinctly. <a href="Arthur%20Henry%20Reginald%20Buller">Arthur Buller</a> coined the term "<a href="wikt%3Ainaequihymeniiferous">inaequihymeniiferous</a>" to describe this mode of hymenial development. The purpose of the staggered basidia sizes is to facilitate the release of spores from the hymenium. There are four zones of spore discharge that correspond to the four sets of basidia, and basidia that have released all of their spores quickly begin to autodigest. The staggered setup minimizes the chance of spores colliding with neighboring basidia during release.

<a href="Cystidia">Cystidia</a> that are located along the edge of the cap (called cheilocystidia) are spherical, and 30–120 by 20–74 µm. The facial cystidia (called pleurocystidia) are club-shaped or elongated ellipses, up to 130–155 µm in length. The pleurocystidia protrude from the face of the gill and act as guards, preventing adjacent gills from touching each other, and also ensuring that the basidia and spores have sufficient room for development. "C. micaceus" may also have scattered caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are 60–100 by 5–10 µm, but their presence is variable and cannot reliably be used for identification. Both <a href="Heinrich%20Anton%20de%20Bary">De Bary</a> and Buller, in their investigations into the structure of the cystidia, concluded that there is a central mass of <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a> formed where numerous thin plates of cytoplasm meet at the center of the cell. De Bary believed that the plates were filamentous branching processes, but Buller thought that they were formed in a process similar to the walls of foam bubbles, and that the central mass was able to slowly change form and position by altering the relative volumes of the <a href="vacuole">vacuole</a>s enclosed by the numerous thin cytoplasmic walls. In older cells, the cytoplasm may be limited to the periphery of the cell, with one huge vacuole occupying the cell center.

The <a href="wikt%3Aglobular">globular</a> cells that make up the mica-resembling scales on the cap are colorless, smooth-walled, and range in size from about 25–65 µm, although most are between 40–50 µm. Buller explained the "glitter" of these cells as follows: "The sparkling of the meal-cells, as well as of the cystidia on the edges and faces of the gills, is simply due to light which strikes them from without and is refracted and reflected to the eye in the same manner as from the minute drops of water one so often sees at the tips of grass leaves on English lawns early in the morning after a dewy night."

In 1914, Michael Levine was the first to report successfully cultivating "C. micaceus" from spores in the laboratory. In his experiments, fruit bodies appeared roughly 40 to 60 days after initially inoculating the <a href="growth%20media">growth media</a> (<a href="agar">agar</a> supplemented with soil, horse dung, or <a href="cornmeal">cornmeal</a>) with spores. Like other coprinoid species, "C. micaceus" undergoes synchronous <a href="meiosis">meiosis</a>. The <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s are readily discernible with light microscopy, and all of the meiotic stages are well-defined. These features have made the species a useful tool in laboratory investigations of <a href="Basidiomycete">Basidiomycete</a> <a href="cytogenetics">cytogenetics</a>. The <a href="chromosome%20number">chromosome number</a> of "C. micaceus" is n=12.

"Coprinellus micaceus" is an edible species, and cooking inactivates the <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s that cause autodigestion or "deliquescence"—a process that can begin as soon as one hour after collection. It is considered ideal for omelettes, and as a flavor for sauces, although it is "a very delicate species easily spoiled by overcooking". The flavor is so delicate that it is easy to overpower and hide with almost anything. The fungus also appeals to fruit flies of the genus "<a href="Drosophila">Drosophila</a>", who frequently use the fruit bodies as hosts for <a href="larva">larva</a>e production.

A study of the <a href="dietary%20mineral">mineral</a> contents of various edible mushrooms found that "C. micaceus" contained the highest concentration of <a href="potassium">potassium</a> in the 34 species tested, close to half a gram of potassium per kilogram of mushroom. Because the species can <a href="bioaccumulation">bioaccumulate</a> detrimental <a href="heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29">heavy metals</a> like <a href="lead">lead</a> and <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a>, it has been advised to restrict consumption of specimens collected from roadsides or other collection sites that may be exposed to or contain pollutants.

The edible "<a href="Coprinellus%20bisporus">Coprinellus bisporus</a>" is nearly identical but lacks the yellowish cap granules and only has two spores per basidium. The scaly inky cap ("Coprinus variegatus" = "<a href="Coprinus%20quadrifidus">Coprinus quadrifidus</a>") has a grayish-brown cap with dull white to brownish scales; its odor is disagreeable. The trooping crumble cap ("<a href="Coprinellus%20disseminatus">Coprinellus disseminatus</a>", edible) has smaller, yellow-brown to grey-brown caps and white gills that turn black but do not dissolve away; it always grows in large clusters on rotting wood (sometimes buried wood). "<a href="Coprinus%20atramentarius">Coprinus atramentarius</a>" is a larger, gray species that grows in dense clusters on stumps or on the ground from buried wood, lacks glistening particles on the cap, and the cap and gills dissolve at maturity. "<a href="Coprinellus%20radians">Coprinellus radians</a>" develops singly or in clumps from a tufted mat of coarse yellow-orange <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a> on the wood. "<a href="Coprinellus%20truncorum">Coprinellus truncorum</a>" is also covered with glistening granules and is said to be almost indistinguishable from "C. micaceus" in the field; microscopy is needed to tell the difference, as "C. truncorum" has ellipsoid spores with a rounded germ pore, compared to the shield-shaped (mitriform) spores with truncated germ pores of "C. micaceus". One study suggests that compared to "C. truncorum", "C. micaceus" is browner in the center of the cap (rather than grayish) and has a greater tendency to grow in clusters; more <a href="molecular%20genetics">molecular</a> evidence is required to determine if the two taxa are genetically identical.

"Coprinellus micaceus" is a <a href="saprotrophic">saprotrophic</a> species, deriving nutrients from dead and decomposing <a href="organic%20matter">organic matter</a>, and grows in and around stumps or logs of broad-leaved trees or attached to buried wood. It prefers feeding on <a href="Bark%20%28botany%29">bark</a>, particularly the <a href="secondary%20phloem">secondary phloem</a>, rather than the wood. In the scheme of the <a href="ecological%20succession">succession</a> of fungal species involved in the decomposition of wood, "C. micaceus" is a "late stage colonizer", and prefers to feed on wood that has already decomposed sufficiently to have reached "a friable softened consistency". A 2010 study suggests that the fungus can also live as an <a href="endophyte">endophyte</a>, inhabiting the woody tissue of healthy trees without causing disease symptoms. The fungus is also associated with disturbed or developed ground, such as the sides of roads and paths, gardens, building sites and the edges of parking lots; it has also been noted for growing indoors on rotting wood in humid environments. In one instance it was discovered about 120 m (400 ft) underground in an abandoned coal mine, growing on wooden gangways and props used to support the roof.

Fruit bodies are commonly found growing in dense clusters, but can also be found growing singly or in small clumps, especially in forested areas. In North America, "C. micaceus" is one of the first edible mushrooms to appear in the spring, and fruits from May to September. In Europe, it fruits from May to December. Although it can grow at any time of the year, it is more prevalent during the spring and fall, coinciding with the higher humidity resulting from spring and autumn rains. A study of air quality conducted in the city of <a href="Santiago%20de%20Compostela">Santiago de Compostela</a> in the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, concluded that most ""Coprinus"" spores present in the atmosphere belonged to "C. micaceus", and that the number of spores went up with increased <a href="relative%20humidity">humidity</a> and rainfall, but decreased with greater temperatures. The species is known for reappearing with successive fruitings at the same location. In one case, a total of of fresh mushrooms were collected from one <a href="elm">elm</a> stump in 10 successive crops over a spring and summer.

"Coprinellus micaceus" has a <a href="cosmopolitan%20distribution">cosmopolitan distribution</a>, and has been collected in northern Africa, South Africa, Europe (including <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>), North America (as far north as <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>), the Hawaiian islands, South America, India, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. <a href="Phylogenetic">Phylogenetic</a> analysis of <a href="ribosomal%20DNA">rDNA</a> sequences from specimens collected in southeastern Asia and Hawaii show that the Hawaiian species form a distinct <a href="clade">clade</a> with little <a href="genetic%20diversity">genetic diversity</a> compared to Asian populations; this suggests that the Hawaiian populations have been introduced relatively recently and have not had much time to develop genetic variation. One study suggests that in South Africa, where "C. micaceus" is rare, it has been frequently confused with the similar-appearing "<a href="Coprinellus%20truncorum">C. truncorum</a>", a more common species in that region. A similar inference has been raised about North American species.

Research into the <a href="natural%20product">natural product</a> chemistry of "Coprinellus micaceus" has revealed the presence of several chemical compounds unique to the species. Micaceol is a <a href="sterol">sterol</a> with "modest" <a href="antibacterial">antibacterial</a> activity against the pathogens "<a href="Corynebacterium%20xerosis">Corynebacterium xerosis</a>" and "<a href="Staphylococcus%20aureus">Staphylococcus aureus</a>". The compound (Z,Z)-4-oxo-2,5-heptadienedioic acid has inhibitory activity against <a href="glutathione%20S-transferase">glutathione S-transferase</a>, an <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> that has been implicated in the resistance of cancer cells against <a href="Chemotherapy">chemotherapeutic</a> agents, especially <a href="Alkylation">alkylating</a> drugs. A 2003 study did not find any antibacterial activity in this species. A 1962 publication reported the presence of the biologically active <a href="indole">indole</a> compound <a href="tryptamine">tryptamine</a> in "C. micaceus", although the concentration was not determined. The fruit bodies additionally produce a variety of <a href="pigment">pigment</a> compounds known as <a href="melanin">melanin</a>s—complex chemical <a href="polymer">polymer</a>s that contribute to the formation of soil <a href="humus">humus</a> after the fruit bodies have disintegrated. "C. micaceus" has been found to be devoid of the toxin <a href="coprine">coprine</a>, the <a href="Antabuse">Antabuse</a>-mimicking chemical found in "<a href="Coprinopsis%20atramentaria">Coprinopsis atramentaria</a>" that causes illness when consumed simultaneously with alcohol.

Armillaria gallica

Armillaria gallica (<a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonymous</a> with "A. bulbosa" and "A. lutea") is a species of <a href="honey%20mushroom">honey mushroom</a> in the family <a href="Physalacriaceae">Physalacriaceae</a> of the order <a href="Agaricales">Agaricales</a>. The species is a common and ecologically important <a href="wood-decay%20fungus">wood-decay fungus</a> that can live as a <a href="saprobe">saprobe</a>, or as an opportunistic <a href="parasitism">parasite</a> in weakened tree hosts to cause <a href="root%20rot">root</a> or <a href="butt%20rot">butt rot</a>. It is found in <a href="temperateness">temperate</a> regions of Asia, North America, and Europe. The species forms <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> singly or in groups in soil or rotting wood. The fungus has been inadvertently <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> to South Africa. "Armillaria gallica" has had a confusing <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a>, due in part to historical difficulties encountered in distinguishing between similar "Armillaria" species. The fungus received international attention in the early 1990s when an individual <a href="colony%20%28biology%29">colony</a> living in a <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> forest was reported to cover an area of , weigh at least , and be 1,500 years old. This individual is popularly known as the "humungous fungus", and is a tourist attraction and inspiration for an annual mushroom-themed festival in <a href="Crystal%20Falls%2C%20Michigan">Crystal Falls</a>. Recent studies have revised the fungus's age to 2,500 years and its size to about 440 tons, four times the original estimate.

"Armillaria gallica" is a largely subterranean fungus, and it produces fruit bodies that are up to about in diameter, yellow-brown, and covered with small scales. On the underside of the <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a> are <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> that are white to creamy or pale orange. The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> may be up to long, with a white cobwebby <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a> that divides the color of the stem into pale orange to brown above, and lighter-colored below. The fungus can develop an extensive system of underground root-like structures, called <a href="rhizomorphs">rhizomorphs</a>, that help it to efficiently decompose dead wood in <a href="temperate%20broadleaf%20and%20mixed%20forests">temperate broadleaf and mixed forests</a>. It has been the subject of considerable scientific research due to its importance as a <a href="plant%20pathogen">plant pathogen</a>, its ability to <a href="bioluminescence">bioluminesce</a>, its unusual <a href="biological%20life%20cycle">life cycle</a>, and its ability to form large and long-lived <a href="clonal%20colony">colonies</a>.

Confusion has surrounded the <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">nomenclature</a> and <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> of the species now known as "Armillaria gallica", paralleling that surrounding the genus "<a href="Armillaria">Armillaria</a>". The <a href="type%20species">type species</a>, "<a href="Armillaria%20mellea">Armillaria mellea</a>", was until the 1970s believed to be a <a href="pleomorphism%20%28microbiology%29">pleiomorphic</a> species with a wide distribution, variable pathogenicity, and one of the broadest <a href="host%20%28biology%29">host</a> ranges known for the fungi. In 1973, <a href="Veikko%20Hintikka">Veikko Hintikka</a> reported a technique to distinguish between "Armillaria" species by growing them together as single <a href="spore">spore</a> isolates on <a href="petri%20dish">petri dish</a>es and observing changes in the <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> of the cultures. Using a similar technique, <a href="Kari%20Korhonen%20%28biologist%29">Kari Korhonen</a> showed in 1978 that the European "Armillaria mellea" <a href="species%20complex">species complex</a> could be separated into five reproductively isolated species, which he named "European Biological Species" (EBS) A through E. About the same time, the North American "A. mellea" was shown to be ten different species (North American Biological Species, or NABS I through X); NABS VII was demonstrated shortly after to be the same species as EBS E. Because several research groups had worked with this widely distributed species, it was assigned several different names.

The species that Korhonen called EBS B was named "A. bulbosa" by Helga Marxmüller in 1982, as it was thought to be equivalent to "Armillaria mellea" <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">var.</a> "bulbosa", first described by <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Barla">Jean Baptiste Barla</a> (Joseph Barla) in 1887, and later raised to species status by <a href="Josef%20Velenovsk%C3%BD">Josef Velenovský</a> in 1927. In 1973, the French mycologist <a href="Henri%20Romagnesi">Henri Romagnesi</a>, unaware of Velenovský's publication, published a description of the species he called "Armillariella bulbosa", based on specimens he had found near <a href="Compi%C3%A8gne">Compiègne</a> and <a href="Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte">Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte</a> in France. These specimens were later demonstrated to be the same species as the EBS E of Korhonen; EBS B was later determined to be "<a href="Armillaria%20cepistipes">A. cepistipes</a>". Therefore, the name "A. bulbosa" was a misapplied name for EBS E. In 1987 Romagnesi and Marxmüller renamed EBS E to "Armillaria gallica". Another <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a>, "A. lutea", had originally been described by <a href="Claude%20Casimir%20Gillet">Claude Casimir Gillet</a> in 1874, and proposed as a name for EBS E. Although the name had <a href="Principle%20of%20Priority">priority</a> due to its early publication date, it was rejected as a "<a href="nomen%20ambiguum">nomen ambiguum</a>" because of a lack of supporting evidence to identify the fungus, including a specimen, <a href="type%20locality%20%28biology%29">type locality</a>, and incomplete collection notes. "A. inflata" (Velenovský, 1920) may represent another synonym, but the type specimens were not preserved, so it is considered a dubious name ("<a href="nomen%20dubium">nomen dubium</a>"). As of 2010, both the <a href="Index%20Fungorum">Index Fungorum</a> and <a href="MycoBank">MycoBank</a> consider "Armillaria gallica" Marxm. & Romagn. to be the current name, with "A. bulbosa" and "A. lutea" as synonyms.

<a href="Phylogenetic">Phylogenetic</a> analysis of North American "Armillaria" species based on analysis of <a href="amplified%20fragment%20length%20polymorphism">amplified fragment length polymorphism</a> data suggests that "A. gallica" is most closely related to "A. sinapina", "A. cepistipes", and "A. calvescens". These results are similar to those reported in 1992 that compared sequences of nuclear <a href="ribosomal%20DNA">ribosomal DNA</a>.

The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "gallica" is botanical <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "French" (from "Gallia", "Gaul"), and refers to the <a href="Type%20locality%20%28biology%29%23type%20locality">type locality</a>. The prior name "bulbosa" is Latin for "bulb-bearing, bulbous" (from "bulbus" and the suffix -"osa"). "Armillaria" is derived from the Latin "armilla", or "bracelet".

The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> of "Armillaria gallica" have <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a> that are broad, and depending on their age, may range in shape from conical to convex to flattened. The caps are brownish-yellow to brown when moist, often with a darker-colored center; the color tends to fade upon drying. The cap surface is covered with slender fibers (same color as the cap) that are erect, or sloping upwards.

When the fruit bodies are young, the underside of the caps have a cottony layer of tissue stretching from the edge of the cap to the stem—a <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a>—which serves to protect the developing <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a>. As the cap grows in size the membrane is eventually pulled away from the cap to expose the gills. The gills have an adnate (squarely attached) to somewhat decurrent (extending down the length of the stem) attachment to the stem. They are initially white, but age to a creamy or pale orange covered with rust-colored spots. The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> is long and thick, and almost club-shaped with the base up to thick. Above the level of the <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a>, the stem is pale orange to brown, while below it is whitish or pale pink, becoming grayish-brown at the base. The ring is positioned about below the level of the cap, and may be covered with yellowish to pale-brownish woolly cottony <a href="mycelium">mycelia</a>. The base of the stem is attached to <a href="rhizomorph">rhizomorph</a>s, black root-like structures 1–3 mm in diameter. While the primary function of the below-ground mycelia is to absorb nutrients from the soil, the rhizomorphs serve a more exploratory function, to locate new food bases.

When the spores are seen in deposit, such as with a <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a>, they appear whitish. They have an <a href="wikt%3Aellipsoid">ellipsoid</a> or <a href="wikt%3Aoblong">oblong</a> shape, usually contain an oil droplet, and have dimensions of 7–8.5 by 5–6 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>. The spore-bearing cells, the <a href="basidium">basidia</a>, are club-shaped, four-spored (rarely two-spored), and measure 32–43 by 7–8.7 µm. Other cells present in the fertile <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a> include the cheilocystidia (<a href="cystidium">cystidia</a> present on the edge of a gill), which are club-shaped, roughly cylindrical and 15–25 by 5.0–12 µm. Cystidia are also present on the stem (called caulocystidia), and are broadly club-shaped, measuring 20–55 by 11–23 µm. The <a href="pileipellis">cap cuticle</a> is made of <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e that are irregularly interwoven and project upward to form the scales seen on the surface. The hyphae that make up the surface scales typically measure 26–88 µm long by 11–27 µm thick and can be covered with a crust of <a href="pigment">pigment</a>. <a href="Clamp%20connection">Clamp connection</a>s are present in the hyphae of most tissues.

Like all "Armillaria" species, "A. gallica" is considered <a href="edible%20mushrooms">edible</a>. Thorough cooking is usually recommended, as the raw mushroom tastes <a href="wikt%3Aacrid">acrid</a> when fresh or undercooked. One author advises to consume only a small portion initially, as some people may experience an upset stomach. The taste is described as "mild to bitter", and the odor "sweet", or reminiscent of <a href="camembert">camembert</a> cheese.

"<a href="Armillaria%20calvescens">Armillaria calvescens</a>" is rather similar in appearance, and can only be reliably distinguished from "A. gallica" by observing microscopic characteristics. "A. calvescens" has a more northern distribution, and in North America, is rarely found south of the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a>. "<a href="Armillaria%20mellea">A. mellea</a>" has a thinner stem than "A. gallica", but can be more definitively distinguished by the absence of clamps at the base of the basidia. Similarly, "A. cepistipes" and "A. gallica" are virtually identical in appearance (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, host range, and microscopic characteristics. <a href="Molecular%20biology">Molecular</a> methods have been developed to discriminate between the two species by comparing <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a>s in the <a href="gene">gene</a> coding <a href="Eukaryotic%20translation%20elongation%20factor%201%20alpha%201">translation elongation factor 1-alpha</a>.

"Armillaria gallica" can produce <a href="cyclobutane">cyclobutane</a>-containing <a href="metabolite">metabolite</a>s such as arnamiol, a <a href="natural%20product">natural product</a> that is classified as a <a href="terpenoid">sesquiterpenoid</a> <a href="aryl">aryl</a> <a href="ester">ester</a>. Although the specific function of arnamiol is not definitively known, similar chemicals present in other "Armillaria" species are thought to play a role in inhibiting the growth of antagonistic bacteria or fungi, or in killing cells of the host plant prior to infection.

The <a href="mycelia">mycelia</a> (but not the <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a>) of "Armillaria gallica" are known to be <a href="bioluminescent">bioluminescent</a>. Experiments have shown that the intensity of the luminescence is enhanced when the mycelia are disturbed during growth or when they are exposed to fluorescent light. Bioluminescence is caused by the action of <a href="luciferase">luciferase</a>s, enzymes that produce light by the <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a> of a <a href="luciferin">luciferin</a> (a <a href="pigment">pigment</a>). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions, or it may help deter <a href="heterotroph">heterotroph</a>s that might consume the fungus.

Researchers reported finding "Armillaria gallica" in the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper Peninsula of Michigan</a> in the early 1990s, during an unrelated research project to study the possible biological effects of <a href="extremely%20low%20frequency">extremely low frequency</a> radio stations, which were being investigated as a means to communicate with submerged submarines. In one particular forest stand, "Armillaria"-infected <a href="oak">oak</a> trees had been harvested, and their stumps were left to rot in the field. Later, when red pines were planted in the same location, the seedlings were killed by the fungus, identified as "A. gallica" (then known as "A. bulbosa"). Using <a href="molecular%20genetics">molecular genetics</a>, they determined that the underground <a href="mycelium">mycelia</a> of one individual fungal <a href="colony%20%28biology%29">colony</a> covered , weighing over , with an estimated age of 1,500 years. The analysis used <a href="restriction%20fragment%20length%20polymorphism">restriction fragment length polymorphism</a> (RFLP) and <a href="RAPD">random amplification of polymorphic DNA</a> (RAPD) to examine <a href="genetic%20isolate">isolates</a> collected from fruit bodies and <a href="rhizomorph">rhizomorph</a>s (underground aggregations of fungal cells that resemble plant roots) along <a href="transect">transect</a>s in the forest. The 15-hectare area yielded isolates that had identical <a href="mating%20type">mating type</a> alleles and <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> <a href="restriction%20fragment">restriction fragment</a> patterns; this degree of genetic similarity indicated that the samples were all derived from a single genetic individual, or <a href="clone%20%28cell%20biology%29">clone</a>, that had reached its size through <a href="vegetative%20reproduction">vegetative growth</a>. In their conclusion, the authors noted: "This is the first report estimating the minimum size, mass, and age of an unambiguously defined fungal individual. Although the number of observations for plants and animals is much greater, members of the fungal kingdom should now be recognized as among the oldest and largest organisms on earth." After the "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>" paper was published, major media outlets from around the world visited the site where the specimens were found; as a result of this publicity, the individual acquired the <a href="common%20name">common name</a> "humongous fungus". There was afterward some scholarly debate as to whether the fungus qualified to be considered in the same category as other <a href="largest%20organism">large organisms</a> such as the <a href="blue%20whale">blue whale</a> or the <a href="giant%20redwood">giant redwood</a>.

The fungus has since become a popular tourist attraction in Michigan, and has inspired a "Humongous Fungus Fest" held annually in August in <a href="Crystal%20Falls%2C%20Michigan">Crystal Falls</a>. The organism was the subject of a <a href="Late%20Show%20Top%20Ten%20List">Late Show Top Ten List</a> on <a href="Late%20Night%20with%20David%20Letterman">Late Night with David Letterman</a>, and an advertising campaign by the rental company <a href="U-Haul">U-Haul</a>.

The <a href="biological%20life%20cycle">life cycle</a> of "A. gallica" includes two <a href="diploid">diploid</a>ization–<a href="haploid">haploid</a>ization events. The first of these is the usual process of <a href="karyogamy">cell fusion</a> (forming a diploid) followed by <a href="meiosis">meiosis</a> during the formation of haploid <a href="basidiospore">basidiospore</a>s. The second event is more cryptic and occurs before fruit body formation. In most <a href="Basidiomycetes">basidiomycetous</a> fungi, the hyphae of compatible <a href="mating%20type">mating type</a>s will fuse to form a two-<a href="cell%20nucleus">nucleate</a>, or <a href="dikaryotic">dikaryotic</a> stage; this stage is not observed in "Armillaria" species, which have cells that are mostly monokaryotic and diploid. Genetic analyses suggest that the dikaryotic mycelia undergo an extra haploidization event prior to fruit body formation to create a <a href="genetic%20mosaic">genetic mosaic</a>. These regular and repeating haploidization events result in increased <a href="genetic%20diversity">genetic diversity</a>, which helps the fungus to adapt to unfavorable changes in environmental conditions, such as drought.

The growth rate of "A. gallica" rhizomorphs is between per year. <a href="Population%20genetics">Population genetic</a> studies of the fungus conducted in the 1990s demonstrated that genetic individuals grow <a href="mitosis">mitotically</a> from a single point of origin to eventually occupy territories that may include many adjacent root systems over large areas (several <a href="hectare">hectare</a>s) of forest floor. Based on the low <a href="mutation%20rate">mutation rate</a>s observed in large, long-lived individuals, "A. gallica" appears to have an especially stable <a href="genome">genome</a>. It has also been hypothesized that genetic stability may result from self-renewing mycelial repositories of nuclei with <a href="stem%20cell">stem cell</a>-like properties.

"Armillaria gallica" can normally be found on the ground, but sometimes on stumps and logs. Mushrooms that appear to be terrestrial are attached to plant roots underneath the surface. It is widely distributed and has been collected in North America, Europe, and Asia (China, Iran, and Japan). The species has also been found in the <a href="Western%20Cape">Western Cape</a> Province of South Africa, where it is thought to have been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> from potted plants imported from Europe during the early colonization of Cape Town. In Scandinavia, it is absent in areas with very cold climates, like Finland or Norway, but it is found in southern Sweden. It is thought to be the most prevalent low altitude species of "Armillaria" in Great Britain and France. The upper limits of its altitude vary by region. In the French <a href="Massif%20Central%20%28geology%29">Massif Central</a>, it is found up to , while in Bavaria, which has a more <a href="continental%20climate">continental climate</a>, the upper limit of distribution reaches . In <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>n forests, it is the most common "Armillaria" between elevations of . <a href="Field%20study">Field studies</a> suggest that "A. gallica" prefers sites that are low in <a href="organic%20matter">organic matter</a> and have high <a href="soil%20pH">soil pH</a>s.

In North America, it is common east of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>, but rare in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>. In California, where it is widely distributed, the fungus is found in a variety of <a href="plant%20community">plant communities</a>, including aspen, coastal oak woodland, <a href="Douglas%20Fir">Douglas Fir</a>, <a href="Klamath%20National%20Forest">Klamath mixed conifer</a>, montane hardwood, montane hardwood-conifer, montane <a href="riparian%20zone">riparian</a>, Redwood, Sierran mixed conifer, <a href="valley%20oak">valley oak</a> woodland, valley-foothill riparian, and <a href="White%20Fir">White Fir</a>. It was found to be the most common "Armillaria" species in hardwood and mixed oak forests in western <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>.

A Chinese study published in 2001 used the <a href="molecular%20biology">molecular biological</a> technique <a href="restriction%20fragment%20length%20polymorphism">restriction fragment length polymorphism</a> to analyze the differences in <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> between 23 "A. gallica" specimens collected from the Northern Hemisphere. The results suggest that based on the restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns observed, there are four global "A. gallica" subpopulations: the Chinese, European, North American–Chinese, and North American–European geographical <a href="lineage%20%28evolution%29">lineages</a>. A 2007 study on the northeastern and southwestern Chinese distribution of "Armillaria", using fruit body and pure culture morphology, concluded that there are several unnamed species (Chinese biological species C, F, H, J and L) that are similar to the common "A. gallica".

"Armillaria gallica" is a weaker <a href="plant%20pathogen">pathogen</a> than the related "A. mellea" or "<a href="Armillaria%20solidipes">A. solidipes</a>", and is considered a secondary parasite—typically initiating infection only after the host's defenses have been weakened by insect defoliation, drought, or infection by another fungus. Fungal infection can lead to <a href="root%20rot">root rot</a> or <a href="butt%20rot">butt rot</a>. As the diseased trees die, the wood dries, increasing the chance of catching fire after being struck by lightning. The resulting forest fire may, in turn, kill the species that killed the trees. Plants that are under <a href="water%20stress">water stress</a> caused by dry soils or <a href="waterlogging%20%28agriculture%29">waterlogging</a> are more susceptible to infection by "A. gallica". It has been shown to be one of several "Armillaria" species responsible for widespread mortality of <a href="oak">oak</a> trees in the Arkansas <a href="Ozark">Ozark</a>s. The fungus has also been shown to infect <a href="Daylily">Daylily</a> in <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>, <a href="Northern%20highbush%20blueberry">Northern highbush blueberry</a> ("Vaccinium corymbosum") in Italy and vineyards ("<a href="Vitis">Vitis</a>" species) of <a href="R%C3%ADas%20Baixas%20%28DO%29">Rías Baixas</a> in northwestern Spain. The latter infestation "may be related to the fact that the vineyards from which they were isolated were located on cleared forestry sites". When "A. solidipes" and "A. gallica" co-occur in the same forest, infection of root systems by "A. gallica" may reduce damage or prevent infection from "A. solidipes".
"Armillaria gallica" can develop an extensive subterranean system of rhizomorphs, which helps it to compete with other fungi for resources or to attack trees weakened by other fungi. A field study in an ancient broadleaved woodland in England showed that of five "Armillaria" species present in the woods, "A. gallica" was consistently the first to colonize tree stumps that had been <a href="coppicing">coppiced</a> the previous year. <a href="Fractal%20geometry">Fractal geometry</a> has been used to model the branching patterns of the hyphae of various "Armillaria" species. Compared to a strongly pathogenic species like "A. solidipes", "A. gallica" has a relatively sparse branching pattern that is thought to be "consistent with a foraging strategy in which acceptable food bases may be encountered at any distance, and which favours broad and divisive distribution of potential inoculum." Because the rhizomorphs form regular <a href="network%20theory">networks</a>, mathematical concepts of <a href="graph%20theory">graph theory</a> have been employed to describe fungal growth and interpret ecological strategies, suggesting that the specific patterns of network attachments allow the fungus "to respond opportunistically to spatially and temporally changing environments".

"Armillaria gallica" may itself be parasitized by other <a href="soil%20life">soil flora</a>. Several species of the fungus "<a href="Trichoderma">Trichoderma</a>", including "<a href="Trichoderma%20polysporum">Trichoderma polysporum</a>", "<a href="Trichoderma%20harzianum">T. harzianum</a>" and "<a href="Trichoderma%20viride">T. viride</a>", are able to attack and penetrate the outer tissue of "A. gallica" rhizomorphs and parasitize the internal hyphae. The infected rhizomorphs become devoid of living hyphae about one week after the initial infection. "<a href="Entoloma%20abortivum">Entoloma abortivum</a>" is another fungus that can live parasitically upon "A. gallica". The whitish-gray malformed fruit bodies that may result are due to the "E. abortivum" hyphae penetrating the mushroom and disrupting its normal development.

Mycena haematopus

Mycena haematopus, commonly known as the bleeding fairy helmet, the burgundydrop bonnet, or the bleeding Mycena, is a species of <a href="fungus">fungus</a> in the <a href="Mycenaceae">Mycenaceae</a> family, of the order <a href="Agaricales">Agaricales</a>. It is widespread and common in Europe and North America, and has also been collected in Japan and Venezuela. It is <a href="saprotrophic">saprotrophic</a>—meaning that it obtains nutrients by consuming decomposing organic matter—and the <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> appear in small groups or clusters on the decaying logs, trunks, and stumps of <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> trees, particularly <a href="beech">beech</a>. The fungus, first described scientifically in 1799, is <a href="Biological%20classification">classified</a> in the <a href="section%20%28botany%29">section</a> "Lactipedes" of the genus "<a href="Mycena">Mycena</a>", along with other species that produce a milky or colored <a href="latex">latex</a>.

The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> of "M. haematopus" have <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a> that are up to wide, whitish <a href="lamellae%20%28mycology%29">gills</a>, and a thin, fragile reddish-brown <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> with thick coarse hairs at the base. They are characterized by their reddish color, the scalloped cap edges, and the dark red latex they "bleed" when cut or broken. Both the fruit bodies and the <a href="mycelium">mycelia</a> are weakly <a href="bioluminescent">bioluminescent</a>. "M. haematopus" produces various <a href="alkaloid">alkaloid</a> <a href="pigment">pigment</a>s unique to this species. The <a href="edible%20mushroom">edibility</a> of the fruit bodies is not known definitively.

The species was initially named "Agaricus haematopus" by <a href="Christian%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christian Hendrik Persoon</a> in 1799, and later <a href="sanctioned%20name">sanctioned</a> under this name by <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a> in his 1821 "Systema Mycologicum". In the <a href="classification%20%28biology%29">classification</a> of Fries, only a few genera were named, and most <a href="agaric">agaric</a> mushrooms were grouped in "Agaricus", which was organized into a large number of <a href="tribe%20%28biology%29">tribes</a>. "Mycena haematopus" gained its current name in 1871 when the German fungal taxonomist <a href="Paul%20Kummer">Paul Kummer</a> raised many of Fries' "Agaricus" tribes to the level of genus, including "<a href="Mycena">Mycena</a>". In 1909 <a href="Franklin%20Sumner%20Earle">Franklin Sumner Earle</a> placed the species in "Galactopus", a genus that is no longer considered separate from "Mycena". "Mycena haematopus" is <a href="classification%20%28biology%29">placed</a> in the <a href="section%20%28botany%29">section</a> "Lactipedes", a grouping of Mycenas characterized by the presence of a milky or colored latex in the stem and flesh of the cap. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> is derived from <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20language">Ancient Greek</a> roots meaning "blood" (αἱματο-, "haimato-") and "foot" (πους, "pous"). It is <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the blood-foot mushroom, the bleeding fairy helmet, the burgundydrop bonnet, or the bleeding Mycena.

In 1914, <a href="Jakob%20Emanuel%20Lange">Jakob Emanuel Lange</a> described the <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> "M. haematopus" var. "marginata", characterized by the reddish color on the edge of the gills; "Mycena" specialist <a href="Rudolph%20Arnold%20Maas%20Geesteranus">Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus</a> considered the coloration of the gill edge too variable to have taxonomical significance. "Mycena haematopus" var. "cuspidata" was initially found in <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a> in 1976, and described as a new <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> by American mycologists <a href="Duane%20Mitchel">Duane Mitchel</a> and <a href="Alexander%20H.%20Smith">Alexander H. Smith</a> two years later. The fruit bodies are characterized by a "beak" on the cap that often splits or collapses as the cap matures. It was treated as "<a href="Mycena%20sanguinolenta">Mycena sanguinolenta</a>" var. "cuspidata" by Maas Geesteranus in 1988.

The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> of "Mycena haematopus" are the reproductive structures produced by cellular threads or <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e which grow in rotting wood. The shape of the <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> of the fruit body will vary depending on its maturity. Young caps, or "buttons", are <a href="wikt%3Aovoid">ovoid</a> (egg-shaped) to conical; later they are campanulate (bell-shaped), and as the fruit body matures, the margins (cap edge) lift upward so that the cap becomes somewhat flat with an <a href="umbo%20%28mycology%29">umbo</a> (a central nipple-shaped bump). The fully grown cap can reach up to in diameter. The surface of the cap initially appears dry and covered with what appears to be a very fine whitish powder, but it soon becomes polished and moist. Mature caps appear somewhat translucent, and develop radial grooves mirroring the position of the gills underneath. The color of the cap is reddish- or pinkish-brown, often tinged with violet, and paler towards the edge. The margin is wavy like the edge of a scallop, and may appear ragged because of lingering remnants of the <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a>.

The mushroom <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> can range from pale to the color of <a href="wine%20%28color%29">red wine</a> (vinaceous), and has no distinctive odor. It oozes a red latex when cut. The <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> have an <a href="adnation">adnate</a> attachment to the stem, meaning they are more or less directly attached to it. They are initially whitish or "grayish vinaceous" in color, and can develop reddish-brown stains. Between 20 and 30 gills reach from the cap edge to the stem, resulting in a gill spacing that is described as "close to subdistant"—gaps are visible between adjacent gills. There are additional gills, called lamellulae, that do not extend directly from the margin to the stem; these are arranged in two or three series (tiers) of equal length. The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> is up to tall and thick, hollow and brittle, and a dark reddish-brown color. In young fruit bodies, the upper part of the stem is densely covered with a pale cinnamon-colored powder which wears off with age. The stem has a mass of coarse hairs at the base. Like the cap, the stem also bleeds a red latex when it is cut or broken.

"Mycena haematopus" can be <a href="parasitism">parasitized</a> by "<a href="Spinellus%20fusiger">Spinellus fusiger</a>", another fungal species which gives the mushroom a strikingly hairy appearance.
The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is white. The <a href="spore">spore</a>s are elliptical, smooth, with dimensions of 8–11 by 5–7 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>. They are <a href="amyloid%20%28mycology%29">amyloid</a>, meaning they will absorb <a href="iodine">iodine</a> when stained with <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a>. The spore-bearing cells (<a href="basidia">basidia</a>) are 4-spored. Sterile cells called <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> are numerous on the edges on the gills; they measure 33–60 µm (sometimes up to 80) by 9–12 µm. Cystidia that are present on the stipe (caulocystidia) appear in clusters, and clublike to irregular in shape, measuring 20–55 by 3.5–12.5 µm. The gill tissue contains numerous lactifers, cells that produce the latex that is secreted when it is cut.

The surface <a href="mycelia">mycelium</a> of "M. haematopus" is whitish and fluffy. Swelling at the terminal tips of hyphae (diameter up to 12 µm) is present, but not very abundant, and <a href="wikt%3Amoniliform">moniliform</a> hyphae are very rare. <a href="Bioluminescence">Bioluminescence</a> is present, but weak. Extracellular <a href="oxidase">oxidase</a> enzymes are present, consistent with its ecological role as a <a href="detritivore">saprobe</a>.

Although some sources claim that "M. haematopus" is <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>, it is "hardly worth collecting because of its small size." Other sources consider the species inedible, or recommend avoiding consumption, "since most of them have not yet been tested for toxins." The taste of the mushroom is mild to slightly bitter.

Another "Mycena" that produces a reddish latex is "<a href="Mycena%20sanguinolenta">Mycena sanguinolenta</a>", the "terrestrial bleeding Mycena". It may be distinguished from "M. haematopus" in several ways: it is smaller, with cap diameters between wide; grows in groups rather than clusters; is found on leaves, dead branches, moss beds and pine needle beds rather than decaying wood; and the edges of its gills are consistently dark brownish-red. Furthermore, range of cap color in "M. sanguinolenta" is different than in "M. haematopus", varying from reddish-to orange-brown, and it lacks a band of partial veil remnants hanging from the margin.

"Mycena haematopus" obtains nutrients from decomposing organic matter (<a href="saprobic">saprobic</a>) and the fruit bodies can typically be found growing on stumps and well-decayed logs, usually in groups that are joined together by a common base. The decomposition of woody debris on the forest floor is the result of the combined activity of a community of fungal species. In the sequential <a href="ecological%20succession">succession</a> of mushrooms species, "M. haematopus" is a "late colonizer" fungus: its fruit bodies appear after the wood has first been decayed by <a href="white%20rot">white rot</a> species. The initial stage of wood decay by white rot fungi involves the breakdown of "acid-unhydrolyzable residue" and holocellulose (a mixture of <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a> and <a href="hemicellulose">hemicellulose</a>).

In North America, "Mycena haematopus" is known to be distributed from <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> southward. According to "Mycena" specialist <a href="Alexander%20H.%20Smith">Alexander H. Smith</a>, it is "the commonest and the most easily recognized one in the genus." The species is common in Europe, and it has also been collected from Japan, and <a href="M%C3%A9rida%20%28state%29">Mérida</a>, Venezuela, as the variety "M. haematopus" var. "marginata". In the Netherlands, "M. haematopus" is one of many mushrooms that can regularly be found fruiting on ancient timber <a href="wharf">wharves</a>. The fruit bodies can be found year-round in mild weather.

Both the mycelia and the fruit bodies of "M. haematopus" (both young and mature specimens) are reported to be <a href="bioluminescent">bioluminescent</a>. However, the luminescence is quite weak, and not visible to the <a href="dark%20adaptation">dark-adapted</a> eye; in one study, light emission was detectable only after 20 hours of <a href="exposure%20%28photography%29">exposure</a> to <a href="photographic%20film">X-ray film</a>. Although the biochemical basis of bioluminescence in "M. haematopus" has not been scientifically investigated, in general, bioluminescence is caused by the action of <a href="luciferase">luciferase</a>s, enzymes that produce light by the <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a> of a <a href="luciferin">luciferin</a> (a <a href="pigment">pigment</a>). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions, or it may help deter <a href="heterotroph">heterotroph</a>s that might consume the fungus.

Several unique chemicals are produced by "Mycena haematopus". The primary <a href="pigment">pigment</a> is <a href="haematopodin%20B">haematopodin B</a>, which is so chemically sensitive (breaking down upon exposure to air and light) that its more stable breakdown product, <a href="haematopodin">haematopodin</a>, was known before its eventual discovery and characterization in 2008. A <a href="organic%20synthesis">chemical synthesis</a> for haematopodin was reported in 1996. Haematopodins are the first pyrroloquinoline <a href="alkaloid">alkaloid</a>s discovered in fungi; pyrroloquinolines combine the structures of <a href="pyrrole">pyrrole</a> and <a href="quinoline">quinoline</a>, both <a href="heterocyclic">heterocyclic</a> <a href="aromatic">aromatic</a> <a href="organic%20compound">organic compound</a>s. Compounds of this type also occur in <a href="marine%20sponge">marine sponge</a>s and are attracting research interest due to various <a href="biological%20activity">biological properties</a>, such as <a href="cytotoxic">cytotoxic</a>ity against tumor <a href="cell%20culture">cell lines</a>, and both <a href="antifungal%20drug">antifungal</a> and <a href="antimicrobial">antimicrobial</a> activities. Additional alkaloid compounds in "M. haematopus" include the red pigments mycenarubins D, E and F. Prior to the discovery of these compounds, pyrroloquinoline alkaloids were considered to be rare in terrestrial sources.

The Green Child

The Green Child is the only completed novel by the English <a href="anarchism">anarchist</a> poet and critic <a href="Herbert%20Read">Herbert Read</a>. Written in 1934 and first published by <a href="Heinemann%20%28book%20publisher%29">Heinemann</a> in 1935, the story is based on the 12th-century <a href="Green%20children%20of%20Woolpit">legend of two green children</a> who mysteriously appeared in the English village of <a href="Woolpit">Woolpit</a>, speaking an apparently unknown language. Read described the legend in his "English Prose Style", published in 1931, as "the norm to which all types of fantasy should conform".

Each of the novel's three parts ends with the apparent death of the story's protagonist, President Olivero, dictator of the <a href="fictional%20country">fictional</a> South American Republic of Roncador. In each case Olivero's death is an <a href="allegory">allegory</a> for his translation to a "more profound level of existence", reflecting the book's overall theme of a search for the meaning of life. Read's interest in <a href="psychoanalytic%20theory">psychoanalytic theory</a> is evident throughout the novel, which is constructed as a "philosophic myth ... in the tradition of <a href="Plato">Plato</a>".

The story contains many autobiographical elements, and the character of Olivero owes much to Read's experiences as an officer in the British Army during the First World War. The novel was positively received, although some commentators have considered it to be "inscrutable", and one has suggested that it has been so differently and vaguely interpreted by those who have given it serious study that it may lack the form and content to justify the praise it has received.

Primarily a literary critic, poet, and an advocate for modern art, Read wrote his only novel, "The Green Child", in about eight weeks during 1934, most of it in the summer house behind his home in <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>, London. Hampstead was then a "nest of gentle artists" who included <a href="Henry%20Moore">Henry Moore</a>, <a href="Paul%20Nash%20%28artist%29">Paul Nash</a>, <a href="Ben%20Nicholson">Ben Nicholson</a>, and <a href="Barbara%20Hepworth">Barbara Hepworth</a>. Read was at that time interested in the idea of unconscious composition, and the first sixteen pages of the manuscript – written on different paper from the rest – are considered by some critics to look like the recollection of a dream. Read claimed in a letter written to psychoanalyst <a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Jung</a> that the novel was a product of <a href="automatic%20writing">automatic writing</a>. As of 2019, the original manuscript is in the possession of the University of Leeds Library; Read had been a student at the university.

Following the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20%281917%29">Russian Revolution of 1917</a> Read became a supporter of communism, believing it to offer "the social liberty of my ideals", but by the 1930s his conviction had begun to waver. Increasingly his political ideology leaned towards <a href="anarchism">anarchism</a>, but it was not until the outbreak of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> in 1936 that Read became confirmed in his anarchist beliefs and stated them explicitly. "The Green Child" was therefore written at a time when Read's political and philosophical ideas were in flux.
There have been six editions of the novel, the first from Heinemann in 1935, priced at 7 shillings and sixpence, the equivalent of about £ in 2019. Ten years later a second edition was published by Grey Walls Press, with the addition of illustrations by Felix Kelly. A third edition, for which <a href="Graham%20Greene">Graham Greene</a> wrote an introduction focusing on the novel's autobiographical elements, was published by Eyre and Spottiswoode in 1947. The first American edition was published in New York by New Directions in 1948, with an introduction by <a href="Kenneth%20Rexroth">Kenneth Rexroth</a>. <a href="Penguin%20Books">Penguin Books</a> published a fifth edition in 1979, which included the 1947 introduction by Greene. A sixth edition, published by R. Clark, appeared in 1989 and was reprinted in 1995, both containing Greene's introduction.

The first and last parts of the story are told as a <a href="Narrative%20mode%23Third-person%20view">third-person narrative</a>, but the middle part is written in the <a href="First-person%20narrative">first person</a>. The story begins in 1861 with the <a href="faked%20death">faked death</a> of President Olivero, dictator of the South American Republic of Roncador, who has staged his own assassination. He returns to his native England, to the village where he was born and raised. On the evening of his arrival Olivero notices that the stream running through the village appears to be flowing backwards, and he decides to follow the water upstream to discover the cause.

The stream's course leads Olivero to a mill, where through a lighted window he sees a woman tied to a chair, forced by the miller to drink the blood of a freshly slaughtered lamb. Instinctively, Olivero hurls himself through the open window, his "leap into the world of fantasy". The miller initially offers no resistance and allows Olivero to release the woman, whom he recognises by the colour of her skin to be Sally, one of the two green children who had mysteriously arrived in the village on the day he left, thirty years earlier; Olivero also recognises the miller as Kneeshaw, an ex-pupil at the village school where he had once taught. During a struggle between the two men Kneeshaw is accidentally drowned in the mill pond. The next morning Olivero and Sally continue on Olivero's quest to find the stream's destination, a pool in the moors high above the village. Paddling in its water, Sally begins to sink into the silvery sand covering its bed. Olivero rushes to her, and hand in hand they sink beneath the water of the pool.

The book's second part recounts the events between Oliver leaving the village as its young schoolmaster and his return as ex-President Olivero. He travels to London initially, hoping to find employment as a writer, but after three years spent working as a bookkeeper in a tailor's shop he takes passage on a ship which lands him in <a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cádiz</a>, Spain. Unable to speak the language, and in possession of a book by <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>, he is arrested as a suspected revolutionary. Held captive for two years, he learns Spanish from his fellow prisoners and determines to travel to one of the liberated American colonies he has learned of, where the possibility exists to establish a new world "free from the oppression and injustice of the old world".

Freed in an amnesty following the death of <a href="Ferdinand%20VII%20of%20Spain">King Ferdinand</a> of Spain, Oliver makes his way to <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>. There he is mistaken for a revolutionary agent and taken to meet General Santos of the Roncador Army. Together they hatch a plot to seize the country's capital city and assassinate its dictator. The plot is successful and "Don Olivero" finds himself leader of the Assembly, making him the country's new dictator, a position he holds for 25 years. Eventually he realises that his style of government is leading the country into stagnation and "moral flaccidity"; he begins to feel nostalgia for the English village where he was brought up, and resolves to escape. Wishing to avoid any suspicion that he is deserting Roncador, Olivero fakes his own assassination.

The final part of the book continues the story from when Olivero and Sally disappear under the water. A large bubble forms around them, transporting them to the centre of the pool and ascending into a large grotto, from where they proceed on foot through a series of adjoining caverns. Sally tells Olivero that this is the country she and her brother left 30 years ago. Soon they encounter her people, to whom Sally, or Siloēn as she is properly known, explains that many years ago she wandered off and became lost, but that she has now returned with one who "was lost too, and now wishes to dwell among us". Olivero and Siloēn are welcomed into the community, where life is ordered around a progression from lower to upper ledges: the first ledge teaches the pleasures of youth; on the second ledge the pleasure of manual work is learned; on the third of opinion and argument; and finally, on the upper ledge, the "highest pleasure", of solitary thought.

Olivero soon tires of the first ledge, and leaving Siloēn behind he moves to the second, where he learns to cut and polish crystals, the most sacred of objects in this subterranean world. Eventually he is allowed to move to the highest ledge of all, "the final stage of life". There he is taught the "basic principles of the universe", that there is only Order and Disorder. "Order ... [is] the space-filling Mass about them ... Disorder is empty space". Disorder is caused by the senses, which, "being confined to the body ... create the illusion of self-hood". Olivero selects a grotto in which to spend what remains of his life alone, contemplating the "natural and absolute beauty" of the crystals he accepts from the crystal-cutters. Food and water is brought regularly, and he settles to the task of preparing his body for "the perfection of death", which when it comes he meets with a "peculiar joy". Removing Olivero's body from the grotto the attendants encounter another group carrying Siloēn, who died at the same time as Olivero. The pair are laid together in a petrifying trough, to "become part of the same crystal harmony", as is customary when any of the Green people die.

Richard Wasson, professor of English, has said that "The Green Child" is "defiant of classification", complicated by its division into "three arbitrarily related sections". The first part of the novel adopts the style of a 19th-century <a href="Gothic%20fiction">Gothic</a> <a href="fairy%20tale">fairy tale</a>. The "fluid, seemingly unbroken hand" in which it is written has encouraged the notion that it was produced in a single sitting, followed by a break before the second part was begun. Part two is written as a "conventional political adventure", in which Olivero tells in flashback the story of his rise to power as the dictator of Roncador. The final part of the novel continues the narrative where the first left off, in the "fantastical, subterranean world of the Green people". So different in style is the first part from what follows that some critics regard it as an entirely separate work, or "the 'true' novel".

Olivero's quest in the underground world is written as a reversal of <a href="Plato">Plato</a>'s <a href="allegory%20of%20the%20cave">allegory of the cave</a> as described in his "<a href="The%20Republic%20%28Plato%29">Republic</a>". In Plato's allegory, prisoners confined in a cave and condemned to stare at a blank wall, with only the light from a flickering fire behind them, see just the shadows of what is real; the philosopher, on the other hand, is like someone released from the cave, able to see the true form of what is casting the shadows. Read turns the idea on its head; when Siloēn left her subterranean world she left behind the Platonic "eternal forms", and Olivero has to follow her back to her "cave" to discover the "divine essence of things".

In the last few pages of the book, in which Olivero prepares for his death and petrification, Read describes Olivero's final thoughts in a form adapted from Plato's "<a href="Phaedo">Phaedo</a>", but in an almost mirror image. <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a>, whose thoughts on the afterlife Plato was describing, argued that death was the ideal home of the soul, but Olivero longs for his body to be free from the torments of the soul, to become part of the crystalline solidity of the universe. Olivero regards life, not death, as the destroyer, "for it [life] disrupts the harmony of inorganic matter". Socrates' suggestion, towards the end of the "Phaedo", that our own world is but one of many, each a hollow in the earth connected by underground rivers, is a strikingly similar image to the subterranean land of the Green people that Read describes. Read however was "almost certainly" influenced in his depiction of the world of the Green people by 1887 utopian novel "<a href="A%20Crystal%20Age">A Crystal Age</a>", a story in which people strive to "live above their own mortality".

The novel's overarching theme is "a dialectical search for the meaning of life, a search which involves a return to life's source".
The Green people's emphasis on achieving "a literal oneness with the material universe" by petrifying the bodies of their dead, although it has "repulsed" some readers, is a vehicle that allows Read to parody the "traditional Western religious notion of the soul aspiring to rise through air to a vaporous paradise".

The manuscript was originally entitled "Inland Far", but at some point, perhaps during the gap between writing the first and subsequent parts, Read changed it to "The Green Child", which suggests that the focus of the novel changed from Olivero's quest for the source of the stream to the story of the green child herself. The original title was an allusion to <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a>'s ode "", which describes the bright landscape' of childhood that casts its spell over later life".

Read was interested in <a href="psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a>, and employed psychoanalytic theory in his work, both <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Freudian</a> and <a href="Carl%20Jung">Jungian</a>, although "more as machinery than as a key to meaning". Olivero's quest for the source of the stream has been described as "travelling allegorically across a landscape of the mind", moving him "from the boundaries of the preconscious to the center of the id". To Olivero, the miller Kneeshaw represents "the evil destructive instinct which lurks beneath the civilised conventions of society", the Freudian <a href="id%2C%20ego%2C%20and%20super-ego">id</a>, whereas Olivero represents the <a href="id%2C%20ego%2C%20and%20super-ego">ego</a>. Thirty years earlier, Olivero had taught Kneeshaw at the local school, where he had seen the boy deliberately break a locomotive from a model railway that Olivero had brought into the school, by overwinding its clockwork mechanism. Unable to comprehend such wilful destruction, and already frustrated by the lack of opportunities offered by village life, Olivero left the next day. "When that spring snapped, something snapped in my mind."

Olivero's confrontation with Kneeshaw displays a Jungian psychoanalytic symbolism, as does the character of Siloēn, "the archetype of the anima, or Jungian 'soul', particularly in its function as intermediary between conscious and unconscious." Kneeshaw represents "the shadow, the dark side of man's nature, the primitive, animal part of the personality found in the personal unconscious". Jung believed that the only way to face the shadow was to acknowledge it, not to repress it as Olivero had done 30 years earlier by leaving the village.

During the First World War Read served with the <a href="Green%20Howards">Green Howards</a>, fighting in the trenches of France. He was awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a>, promoted to the rank of lieutenant, and became "obsessively determined not to betray his own men through cowardice". The novel's development of the "clearly autobiographical hero" of Olivero owes a great deal to Read's wartime experiences and the "resolute self-possession" they instilled in him. The irony of Olivero overthrowing a dictator only to become one himself is perhaps consistent with a view Read expressed in the mid-1930s: "From certain points of view, therefore, I can welcome the notion of the totalitarian state, whether in its Fascist or Communist form. I am not afraid of the totalitarian state as an economic fact, an economic machine to facilitate the complex business of living in a community."

The son of a farmer, Read was born at Muscoates Grange, about south of the small <a href="North%20Yorkshire">North Yorkshire</a> market town of <a href="Kirkbymoorside">Kirkbymoorside</a>, to which he returned in 1949. One of his favourite walks was along the course of <a href="Hodge%20Beck">Hodge Beck</a>, the inspiration for the stream followed by Olivero. Hodge Beck led to a mill, which Read called his "spiritual hermitage".

The crystals carved by the workmen on the second ledge of the Green people's underground world, and contemplated by the sages on the highest ledge of all, symbolise Read's ideas about the relationship of art to nature. He believed physical form to be the "underlying principle of the universe ... the ultimate reality in a completely material cosmos. Therefore it is the quality of recurring forms that makes possible all beauty and value".

In the words of historian <a href="David%20Goodway">David Goodway</a>, Read's "remarkable career and formidable output have generated a surprisingly limited biographical and critical literature". Richard Wasson has commented that "The Green Child" "though judged favorably by the few critics and scholars who give it serious study ... is so vaguely and variously interpreted that it would seem to lack both the form and the content which justify such praise". The critic Richard E. Brown, writing in 1990, considered the work to be "an important attempt by one of [the 20th-century's] most influential English critics to integrate his wide-ranging thoughts into a complex interpretation of experience", but added that it divided commentators, appearing to some to be "fascinating but inscrutable". Reviewing the first American edition in 1948, Professor of English Robert Gorham Davis commented that the novel "baffled some English critics when it arrived in 1935", but that it was "beautifully imagined and beautifully written".

A review published in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" shortly after the book's publication described it as a "very charming philosophical tale", and in his paper the historian and lecturer Bob Barker praised the novel for being "remarkable for its cool yet vivid style". Critic Orville Prescott, writing in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", although admitting that the novel was "beautifully written" and "a triumph of delicate and suggestive mystification", nevertheless concluded that the story was "ridiculous" and "vexatious". He ended his review with the words: "One feels constantly that shining truths are about to be revealed; that there is something important, something significant, hidden in these pages. But it is never made clear, while the ridiculous details remain all too conspicuously in view." Prescott was just as critical of Rexroth's preface to the first American edition, describing it as a "pretentious introduction of uncommon density". Writing in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" in 1993, shortly after the 100th anniversary of Read's birth, critic <a href="Geoffrey%20Wheatcroft">Geoffrey Wheatcroft</a> commented that Read may not have been a great novelist "but "The Green Child" is the kind of book to write if you are going to leave just the one novel behind: singular, odd, completely original".

Otto Becher

<a href="Rear%20admiral%20%28Australia%29">Rear Admiral</a> Otto Humphrey Becher, & <a href="Medal%20bar">Bar</a> (13 September 1908 – 15 June 1977) was a senior officer in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> (RAN). Born in <a href="Harvey%2C%20Western%20Australia">Harvey, Western Australia</a>, Becher entered the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Naval%20College">Royal Australian Naval College</a> in 1922. After graduating in 1926, he was posted to a series of staff and training positions prior to specialising in <a href="gun">gun</a>nery.

A <a href="lieutenant%20commander">lieutenant commander</a> at the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, Becher assisted in the extraction of Allied troops from the <a href="Namsos%20Campaign">Namsos</a> region of Norway while aboard the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> , and was decorated with the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a>. Following service in the <a href="Mediterranean%2C%20Middle%20East%20and%20African%20theatres%20of%20World%20War%20II">Mediterranean theatre</a>, he returned to Australia in 1942 as officer-in-charge of the gunnery school at . He spent two years at "Cerberus" before being given command of the <a href="Q%20and%20R%20class%20destroyer">Q class destroyer</a> in March 1944. While commanding "Quickmatch" in operations against Japanese forces in the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific</a>, Becher earned a <a href="Medal%20bar">Bar</a> to his Distinguished Service Cross.

At the war's end Becher was posted to the Navy Office and later to the aircraft carrier ; in 1951 he was given command of the destroyer . "Warramunga" formed part of Australia's contribution to the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> forces engaged in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>; Becher was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">captain</a> and awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> while carrying out operations in Korean waters. On returning to Australia, he filled several staff positions and commanded the aircraft carriers and . Promoted to rear admiral in 1959, he served as <a href="Flag%20officer">Flag Officer Commanding</a> <a href="Commander%20Australian%20Fleet">Australian Fleet</a> from 1964 to 1965, before taking up the post of Flag Officer-in-Charge East Australia Area. Becher retired from the RAN in 1966, and died in 1977 at the age of 68.

Otto Becher was born in <a href="Harvey%2C%20Western%20Australia">Harvey, Western Australia</a>, on 13 September 1908, to Francis Joseph Becher, an <a href="orchardist">orchardist</a>, and Antonia Amalie (née Vetter). On 1 January 1922, at the age of thirteen, he enrolled in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Naval%20College">Royal Australian Naval College</a> at <a href="Jervis%20Bay%20Territory">Jervis Bay</a>, where he performed well both academically and at sport, receiving <a href="Sporting%20colours">colours</a> for <a href="field%20hockey">hockey</a> and <a href="tennis">tennis</a>. Graduating in 1926, he served as a <a href="Midshipman%23Royal%20Australian%20Navy">midshipman</a> aboard and later , before being posted to the United Kingdom in September of that year for further sea-training and professional development with the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>.

Becher was promoted to acting <a href="sub-lieutenant">sub-lieutenant</a> in September 1928; the rank was made substantive the following March. He returned to Australia in January 1930 and was raised to <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a>, gaining further seafaring experience over the next two years on and . Deciding to specialise in gunnery, he attended an advanced course at the Royal Navy's gunnery school at in England from September 1932 until April 1934. Returning to Australia in May 1934, Becher was posted to the gunnery school at the shore establishment HMAS "Cerberus" in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> until June 1935.

On 7 January 1935, Becher married Valerie Chisholm Baird at St Michael's Anglican Church in <a href="Vaucluse%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Vaucluse</a>, New South Wales; the couple would have three sons. From June 1935 to March 1937, he served aboard HMAS "Canberra" as <a href="intelligence%20officer">intelligence officer</a>, after which he was transferred to for <a href="flotilla">flotilla</a> duties. Promoted to lieutenant commander on 16 June 1938, Becher briefly returned to "Cerberus" before embarking for the United Kingdom on exchange with the Royal Navy in January 1939.

Becher was serving as squadron gunnery officer aboard the Royal Navy <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> when the Second World War broke out. In May 1940, "Devonshire" was dispatched to the <a href="Namsos%20Campaign">Namsos</a> region of Norway to assist in the extraction of <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> troops. Commended for his "daring, resource and devotion" during the operation, Becher was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a>. The notification for the decoration was published in a supplement to the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 19 July 1940, and the investiture ceremony was held by <a href="George%20VI%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George VI</a> at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> on 11 March 1941.

In late November 1940, Becher transferred to the recently launched destroyer as part of the ship's commissioning crew. While completing working-up exercises, "Napier" was tasked with transferring <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British Prime Minister</a> <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> and his wife from <a href="Thurso">Thurso</a> in Scotland to the battleship , and later returning them to the mainland. With her working-up complete, "Napier" was initially posted to convoy duties in the <a href="North%20Atlantic">North Atlantic</a>, before setting sail in April 1941 with for the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Mediterranean">Mediterranean Sea</a>. Arriving in May, she formed up as part of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Mediterranean Fleet</a>.

"Napier" assisted in the evacuation of British and <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> troops from the island of Crete in late May, following the successful <a href="Battle%20of%20Crete">Axis invasion</a>. On one such occasion the vessel embarked 296 soldiers, three women, one Greek and one Chinese civilian, ten sailors, two children and a dog. Returning to <a href="Alexandria%2C%20Egypt">Alexandria</a>, the destroyer came under attack but arrived unscathed. Two days later "Napier" was less fortunate; having taken 705 soldiers on board, she was targeted on her return journey by a formation of twelve <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2088">German dive-bombers</a>. The ship was struck twice by bombs and suffered damage to the <a href="stern">stern</a>, the engine room and boiler room. One of the aircraft was shot down and a further three damaged. Although no allied casualties were sustained and the destroyer arrived safely in Alexandria, she spent the next two-and-a-half months in <a href="Port%20Said">Port Said</a> under repair.

Becher returned to Australia in early 1942, and from 17 May was appointed officer-in-charge of the gunnery school at HMAS "Cerberus". He remained at this post for almost two years until, on 12 March 1944, he was given command of the destroyer —formed up as part of the <a href="Eastern%20Fleet">Eastern Fleet</a>. On 22 July, "Quickmatch" was among a 23-vessel strong task force that set out from <a href="Trincomalee">Trincomalee</a> to assault the Japanese naval base off northern <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> at <a href="Sabang%2C%20Indonesia">Sabang Island</a>. The formation approached Sabang on the night of 24/25 July, launching fighter strikes on airfields in the area at first light. At 06:55, the fleet bombarded the harbour installations, coastal defence batteries and the military barracks. As the formation's two battleships maintained their fire, "Quickmatch" joined three other ships that entered the harbour to carry out close-range bombardment. After completing their task, "Quickmatch" and her fellows withdrew under the cover of fire from two cruisers. Praised for his "outstanding courage and skill" in pressing home the assault, Becher was awarded a <a href="Medal%20bar">Bar</a> to his Distinguished Service Cross, announced in a supplement to the "London Gazette" on 31 October 1944.

In October 1944, "Quickmatch" was transferred to Australian waters and underwent her annual refit at Sydney from November to December. Once the refit was completed she operated mainly off the Australian coast. During the early hours of 25 December 1944, the Navy Office in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> received an <a href="SOS">SOS</a> from the SS "Robert J. Walker", reporting that she had been torpedoed by a submarine while travelling from <a href="Fremantle%2C%20Western%20Australia">Fremantle, Western Australia</a>, to Sydney. Aircraft were dispatched to provide aerial cover, and HMA Ships "Quickmatch", "Kiama" and "Yandra" were directed to "Robert J. Walker"s position. "Quickmatch" and "Yandra" were to operate against the submarine, while "Kiama" was to take the "Robert J. Walker" under tow. Arriving at the reported location at approximately 23:30 that evening, "Quickmatch", under the command of Becher, and "Kiama" patrolled the vicinity in search of the submarine and "Robert J. Walker"s crew. Sixty-seven men were discovered in <a href="Lifeboat%20%28shipboard%29">lifeboats</a> at 05:45 the following morning and were taken aboard "Quickmatch"; "Robert J. Walker" had sunk two hours earlier with the loss of two crew.

Becher was promoted to <a href="Commander%23Australia">commander</a> on 31 December 1944, and the following month "Quickmatch" was transferred to the recently established <a href="British%20Pacific%20Fleet">British Pacific Fleet</a>. On 28 February, the British Pacific Fleet, including "Quickmatch", sailed from <a href="Sydney%20Harbour">Sydney Harbour</a> for <a href="Manus%20Island">Manus Island</a> to prepare for its role in support of the planned United States <a href="Battle%20of%20Okinawa">invasion of Okinawa</a>. The fleet engaged in eleven days of exercises at Manus before departing for <a href="Ulithi">Ulithi</a>, and on 23 March was attached to the <a href="United%20States%20Fifth%20Fleet">United States Fifth Fleet</a> with the designation "Task Force 57". Setting sail for Okinawa two days later, the fleet launched air strikes against airfield targets in the <a href="Sakishima%20Islands">Sakishima Islands</a> on 26 and 27 March. During these operations "Quickmatch" formed part of the escort for the fleet's aircraft carriers. Becher later stated: "These two days' operations were successful, the enemy airstrips being neutralised and a number of aircraft being destroyed on the ground." Task Force 57 continued operations around the Sakishima Islands for the following two months to cover the United States' left flank, with "Quickmatch" forming part of the carrier force's escort throughout this period.

On 25 June 1945, Becher relinquished command of the "Quickmatch" and returned to Australia, where he was attached to the shore base . For his "distinguished service ... in the Pacific" he received a <a href="Mention%20in%20Despatches">Mention in Despatches</a>. In August, he transferred to HMAS "Cerberus" for duties with the Navy Office.

Becher remained with the Navy Office until November 1947, when he was posted to the United Kingdom to join the aircraft carrier 's commissioning crew. Embarking from Melbourne during February 1948, he was temporarily attached to <a href="HMNB%20Devonport">HMS "Drake"</a> and later until "Sydney"s commissioning on 16 December. His service aboard the aircraft carrier lasted for two years, and was followed on 23 January 1950 by an appointment as Commanding Officer to the shore establishment . However, Becher's time at "Watson" was cut short when, on 28 July, he relieved Captain <a href="Alan%20McNicoll">Alan McNicoll</a> as commander of the destroyer HMAS "Warramunga", which had been selected for service in the Korean War. "Warramunga" was to be attached to a force of five Royal Navy destroyers led by a captain, making it expedient to have the Australian ship commanded by an officer of lower rank.

"Warramunga" arrived in Korean waters in late August 1950. After some initial escort work, the destroyer joined as part of the carrier 's protective screen while the latter contributed air cover to the Allied <a href="Battle%20of%20Inchon">landing at Inchon</a> on 15 September. For the next three months, "Warramunga" engaged in patrol and screening duties, in addition to transporting food for famine relief.

On 4 December, "Warramunga" and "Bataan" supported the emergency withdrawal of Allied troops from <a href="Nampho">Chinnampo</a>. Becher decided to sail up a channel of the <a href="Taedong%20River">Taedong River</a> known as Short Cut, which according to his charts should have allowed him five to ten feet of clearance. The chart proved inaccurate, and "Warramunga" ran aground at 23:15; Becher's only option was to wait for the rising tide to float the destroyer off. "Warramunga" came free at 23:50 without having sustained damage, and was able to resume her mission, escorting troop transports south. Later, Becher brought "Warramunga" alongside "Bataan" and entreated the latter's commander, via megaphone, to keep quiet about the incident. With Becher's promotion to captain due, he was concerned that if the Naval Board became aware of the grounding his promotion would be delayed until an investigation had taken place. His "well-earned" rise in rank came through as scheduled on 31 December. On the journey south, "Warramunga"s crew developed a new way of signalling between ships that was considerably quicker than using international code flags. Known to the crew as the "Murphy Method", it involved wrapping messages around potatoes and throwing them from one ship to the other.

"Warramunga" participated in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Wonsan">Siege of Wonsan</a> during late February 1951, where she engaged and partially destroyed North Korean shore batteries, as well as shelling buildings and transport infrastructure. Despite coming under fire the destroyer sustained no damage. For the remainder of her tour in Korea, "Warramunga" took part in patrols and shore bombardments, earning special praise from Vice Admiral <a href="C.%20Turner%20Joy">C. Turner Joy</a>, Commander US Naval Forces Far East, for the accuracy of her gunnery.

On 17 July 1951, it was announced that Becher had been appointed as an honorary <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a> to the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General of Australia</a> for a period of three years. Following "Warramunga"s departure from Korean waters on 1 August, Rear Admiral <a href="Alan%20Scott-Moncrieff">Alan Scott-Moncrieff</a>, Commander West Coast Blockade Force, commented: "She has been a tower of strength and done an incredible amount of steaming with no troubles at all. I cannot speak too highly of Captain O. H. Becher and his men ..." Together with "Bataan", "Warramunga" had borne the brunt of Australia's naval contribution to the Korean War. Noting his "courage, skill and determination", a recommendation for Becher to be awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> was approved by the <a href="Australian%20Government">Australian Government</a> on 17 August 1951, and announced in the "London Gazette" the following month. For his "meritorious service ... as C.O. of HMAS "Warramunga"", Becher was also decorated by the United States with the <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a>.

Becher retained command of "Warramunga" until October 1951, when he was posted to the shore base for service with the Navy Office as Deputy Chief of Naval Personnel and Director of Personal Services. In September that year he was additionally appointed trustee of the Services Canteens Trust Fund; a position he held until October 1952 and for which he received a letter of appreciation from the <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Defence</a>. The same month he assumed the position of <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Navy%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of Naval Staff</a>. On 25 August 1954, Becher was given command of the aircraft carrier <a href="HMS%20Vengeance%20%28R71%29">HMAS "Vengeance"</a>, and in October he returned with his new command to the Korean theatre to transport the aircraft, equipment and personnel of <a href="No.%2077%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 77 Squadron RAAF</a> back to Australia.

In 1956, Becher embarked for the United Kingdom to attend the <a href="Imperial%20Defence%20College">Imperial Defence College</a>. A month after his December graduation, he travelled back to Australia and assumed command of . Becher remained with "Melbourne" until December 1958, at which time he returned to the Navy Office at HMAS "Lonsdale" to resume his role as Deputy Chief of Naval Staff. He was promoted to acting <a href="Rear%20admiral%20%28Australia%29">rear admiral</a> on 3 January 1959, the rank being made substantive twelve months later. In the <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">Queen's Birthday Honours</a> of 1961, Becher was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a>.

Relinquishing his position with the Navy Office in 1962, Becher was sent to the United Kingdom as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in London. In January 1964 he returned to Australia, and was made <a href="Commander%20Australian%20Fleet">Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet</a>. During his time in this role Becher became embroiled in the controversy that followed the <a href="Melbourne-Voyager%20collision">collision of HMA Ships "Voyager" and "Melbourne"</a>, which took place in February that year. Prior to giving evidence before the <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> that had been established to investigate the incident, Becher had discussed events with "Melbourne"s Commanding Officer, Commander Ronald Robertson. The discussion became public knowledge, and led to suggestions of conspiracy. Becher stated to the commission that "Melbourne" should have questioned "Voyager"s final movements; his evidence is alleged to have influenced the Royal Commissioner, <a href="John%20Spicer%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Sir John Spicer</a>, to place a degree of blame on Robertson. In 1965, Becher assumed his final command as Flag Officer-in-Charge East Australia Area, before retiring from the Royal Australian Navy on 6 March 1966.

Following his retirement, Becher accepted the position of Director-General of Recruiting for the Australian armed forces from 1966 until 1969, a period during which <a href="conscription%20in%20Australia">conscription</a> was in effect. Minister of Defence <a href="Allen%20Fairhall">Allen Fairhall</a> asked Becher to find enough volunteers to fill the armed forces, and Becher believed that conscription eroded professional standards, but he found this task difficult given that the military was "competing with industry, and the country was short of labour." He also held the post of chairman of the Council of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the <a href="University%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">University of New South Wales</a>. On 15 June 1977, aged 68, Becher died from a <a href="myocardial%20infarction">myocardial infarction</a> at <a href="Sydney%20Hospital">Sydney Hospital</a>. Survived by his wife and their three sons, he was cremated.

Ambondro mahabo

Ambondro mahabo is a <a href="mammal">mammal</a> from the <a href="middle%20Jurassic">middle Jurassic</a> (about 167 million years ago) of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. The only species of the genus Ambondro, it is known from a fragmentary <a href="mandible">lower jaw</a> with three teeth, interpreted as the last <a href="premolar">premolar</a> and the first two <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a>. The premolar consists of a central <a href="cusp%20%28dentistry%29">cusp</a> with one or two smaller cusps and a <a href="cingulum%20%28dentistry%29">cingulum</a> (shelf) on the inner, or lingual, side of the tooth. The molars also have such a lingual cingulum. They consist of two groups of cusps: a <a href="trigonid">trigonid</a> of three cusps at the front and a <a href="talonid">talonid</a> with a main cusp, a smaller cusp, and a crest at the back. Features of the talonid suggest that "Ambondro" had <a href="tribosphenic%20molar">tribosphenic molar</a>s, the basic arrangement of molar features also present in <a href="marsupial">marsupial</a> and <a href="placental">placental</a> mammals. It is the oldest known mammal with putatively tribosphenic teeth; at the time of its discovery it antedated the second oldest example by about 25 million years.

Upon its description in 1999, "Ambondro" was interpreted as a primitive relative of <a href="Tribosphenida">Tribosphenida</a> (marsupials, placentals, and their extinct tribosphenic-toothed relatives). In 2001, however, an alternative suggestion was published that united it with the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> Australian "<a href="Ausktribosphenos">Ausktribosphenos</a>" and the <a href="monotreme">monotreme</a>s (the <a href="echidna">echidna</a>s, the <a href="platypus">platypus</a>, and their extinct relatives) into the clade <a href="Australosphenida">Australosphenida</a>, which would have acquired tribosphenic molars independently from marsupials and placentals. The Jurassic Argentinean "<a href="Asfaltomylos">Asfaltomylos</a>" and "<a href="Henosferus">Henosferus</a>" and the Cretaceous Australian "<a href="Bishops%20whitmorei">Bishops</a>" were later added to Australosphenida, and new work on wear in australosphenidan teeth has called into question whether these animals, including "Ambondro", did have tribosphenic teeth. Other paleontologists have challenged this concept of Australosphenida, and instead proposed that "Ambondro" is not closely related to "Ausktribosphenos" plus monotremes, or that monotremes are not australosphenidans and that the remaining australosphenidans are related to placentals.

"Ambondro mahabo" was described by a team led by John Flynn in a 1999 paper in "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>". The scientific name derives from the village of <a href="Ambondromahabo">Ambondromahabo</a>, close to which the fossil was found. It is known from the <a href="Bathonian">Bathonian</a> (<a href="middle%20Jurassic">middle Jurassic</a>, about 167 million years ago) of the <a href="Mahajanga%20Basin">Mahajanga Basin</a> in northwestern Madagascar, in the Isalo III unit, the youngest of the three rock layers that make up the Isalo "<a href="Group%20%28stratigraphy%29">Group</a>". This unit has also yielded <a href="crocodyliform">crocodyliform</a> and <a href="plesiosaur">plesiosaur</a> teeth and remains of the sauropod "<a href="Lapparentosaurus">Lapparentosaurus</a>".

"Ambondro" was described on the basis of a fragmentary right <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (lower jaw) with three teeth in it (Figure 1), interpreted as the last <a href="premolar">premolar</a> (p-last) and the first two <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a> (m1 and m2). It is in the collection of the <a href="University%20of%20Antananarivo">University of Antananarivo</a> as specimen UA 10602. Relative to other primitive mammals, it is small. Each of the teeth has a prominent <a href="cingulum%20%28dentistry%29">cingulum</a> (shelf) on the inner (lingual) side. The p-last has a strong central <a href="cusp%20%28dentistry%29">cusp</a>. There is a cuspule (small cusp) on the back of the tooth and probably another on the inner front corner. This tooth resembles the molars of <a href="symmetrodont">symmetrodont</a>s, a group of primitive mammals, but the back cusp is smaller than the <a href="metaconid">metaconid</a> of symmetrodonts.

The front half of the m1 and m2 consists of the <a href="trigonid">trigonid</a>, a group of three cusps forming a triangle: the <a href="paraconid">paraconid</a> at the front on the inner side, <a href="protoconid">protoconid</a> in the middle on the outer (labial) side, and metaconid at the back on the inner side (see Figure 2). The three cusps form a right angle with each other at the protoconid, so that the trigonid is described as "open". The paraconid is higher than the metaconid. At the front margin, a cingulum is present that is divided into two small cusps. Unlike in various early tribosphenic mammals and close relatives, there is no additional cuspule behind the metaconid. At the back of the trigonid, the crest known as the <a href="distal%20metacristid">distal metacristid</a> is located relatively close to the outer side of the tooth and is continuous with another crest, the <a href="cristid%20obliqua">cristid obliqua</a>, which is in turn connected to the back of the tooth.

The <a href="talonid">talonid</a>, another group of cusps, makes up the back of the tooth. It is wider than long and contains a well-developed cusp, the <a href="hypoconid">hypoconid</a>, on the outer side and a depression, the <a href="talonid%20basin">talonid basin</a>, in the middle. The cristid obliqua connects to the hypoconid. The smaller <a href="hypoconulid">hypoconulid</a> cusp is present towards the inner side of the tooth, and the hypoconid and hypoconulid are connected by a cutting edge which is suggestive of the presence of a <a href="metacone">metacone</a> cusp on the upper molars. Further towards the inner side, a crest, the <a href="entocristid">entocristid</a>, rims the talonid basin; on m1, it is swollen and on m2, it contains two small cuspules, but a distinct <a href="entoconid">entoconid</a> cusp is absent. This entocristid is continuous with the lingual cingulum.

<a href="Wear%20facet">Wear facet</a>s are areas of a tooth that show evidence of contact with a tooth in the opposing jaw when the teeth are brought together (known as <a href="Occlusion%20%28dentistry%29">occlusion</a>). Flynn and colleagues identified two wear facets at the front and back margins of the talonid basin; they argue that these wear facets suggest the presence of a <a href="protocone">protocone</a> (another cusp on the outer side of the tooth) on the upper molars. In a 2005 paper on "<a href="Asfaltomylos">Asfaltomylos</a>", a related primitive mammal from Argentina, Thomas Martin and Oliver Rauhut disputed the presence of these wear facets within the talonid basin in "Ambondro" and instead identified wear facets on the cusps and crests surrounding the basin. They proposed that wear in the australosphenidan talonid occurs mainly on the rims, not in the talonid basin itself, and that australosphenidans may not have had a functional protocone.

In their paper, Flynn and colleagues described "Ambondro" as the oldest mammal with <a href="tribosphenic%20molar">tribosphenic molar</a>s—the basic molar type of <a href="metatheria">metatheria</a>n (<a href="marsupial">marsupial</a>s and their extinct relatives) and <a href="eutheria">eutheria</a>n (<a href="placental">placental</a>s and their extinct relatives) mammals, characterized by the protocone cusp on the upper molars contacting the talonid basin on the lower molars in chewing. The discovery of "Ambondro" was thought to extend the known temporal range of tribosphenic mammals 25 million years further into the past. Consequently, Flynn and colleagues argued against the prevailing view that tribosphenic mammals originated on the northern continents (<a href="Laurasia">Laurasia</a>), and instead proposed that their origin lies in the south (<a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>). They cited the retention of a distal metacristid and an "open" trigonid as characters separating "Ambondro" from more modern tribosphenidans.

In 2001, <a href="Zhe-Xi%20Luo">Zhe-Xi Luo</a> and colleagues alternatively proposed that a tribosphenic molar pattern had arisen twice (compare Figure 3, top)—once giving rise to the marsupials and placentals (<a href="Boreosphenida">Boreosphenida</a>), and once producing "Ambondro", the Cretaceous Australian "<a href="Ausktribosphenos">Ausktribosphenos</a>", and the living <a href="monotreme">monotreme</a>s, which first appeared in the Cretaceous (united as <a href="Australosphenida">Australosphenida</a>). They characterized Australosphenida by the shared presence of a cingulum on the outer front corner of the lower molars, a short and broad talonid, a relatively low trigonid, and a triangulated last lower premolar.

Also in 2001, Denise Sigogneau-Russell and colleagues in their description of the earliest Laurasian tribosphenic mammal, "<a href="Tribactonodon">Tribactonodon</a>", agreed with the relationship between "Ausktribosphenos" and monotremes, but argued that "Ambondro" was closer to Laurasian tribosphenidans than to "Ausktribosphenos" and monotremes. As evidence against the integrity of Australosphenida, they cited the presence of lingual cingula in various non-australosphenidan mammals; the presence of two cusps in the anterior cingulum in "Ambondro" as well as some boreosphenidans; the different appearance of the premolar in "Ambondro" (flat) and "Ausktribosphenos" (squared); and the contrast between the talonids of "Ambondro" (with a well-developed hypoconid on the labial side) and "Ausktribosphenos" (squared).

The next year, Luo and colleagues published a more thorough analysis confirming their previous conclusion and adding the Cretaceous Australian "<a href="Bishops%20whitmorei">Bishops</a>" to Australosphenida. They mentioned the condition of the hypoconulid, which is inclined forward, rather than backward as in boreosphenidans, as an additional australosphenidan character and noted that "Ausktribosphenos" and monotremes were united, to the exclusion of "Ambondro", by the presence of a V-shaped notch in the distal metacristid. In the same year, "Asfaltomylos" was described from the Jurassic of Argentina as another australosphenidan. In contrast to "Ambondro", this animal lacked a distal metacristid and did not have as well-developed a lingual cingulum.

However, in 2003 Michael Woodburne and colleagues revised the <a href="cladistics">phylogenetic analysis</a> published by Luo and colleagues, making several changes to the data, particularly in the monotremes. Their results (Figure 3, bottom) challenged the division between Australosphenida and Boreosphenida, as proposed by Luo et al. Instead, they excluded monotremes from Australosphenida and placed the remaining australosphenidans close to Eutheria, with "Ambondro" most closely related to "Asfaltomylos". In 2007, Guillermo Rougier and colleagues described another australosphenidan, "<a href="Henosferus">Henosferus</a>", from the Jurassic of Argentina; they argued against a relationship between Eutheria and Australosphenida (Figure 3, top), but were ambivalent about the placement of monotremes within Australosphenida. Based in part on Martin and Rauhut's earlier work on wear facets in australosphenidans, they questioned the presence of a true functional protocone on the upper molars of non-monotreme australosphenidans—none of which are known from upper teeth—and consequently suggested that australosphenidans may not, after all, have had truly tribosphenic teeth.

Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas

Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas is the third book of <a href="Maya%20Angelou">Maya Angelou</a>'s seven-volume <a href="autobiography">autobiography</a> series. Set between 1949 and 1955, the book spans Angelou's early twenties. In this volume, Angelou describes her struggles to support her young son, form meaningful relationships, and forge a successful career in the entertainment world. The work's 1976 publication was the first time an African-American woman had expanded her life story into a third volume. Scholar Dolly McPherson calls the book "a graphic portrait of the adult self in bloom", while critic Lyman B. Hagen calls it "a journey of discovery and rebirth".

In "Singin' and Swingin"', Angelou examines many of the same subjects and themes in her previous autobiographies including travel, music, race, conflict, and motherhood. Angelou depicts the conflict she felt as a single mother, despite her success as a performer as she travels Europe with the musical "<a href="Porgy%20and%20Bess">Porgy and Bess</a>". Her depictions of her travels, which take up 40 percent of the book, have roots in the African-American <a href="slave%20narrative">slave narrative</a>. Angelou uses music and musical concepts throughout "Singin' and Swingin';" McPherson calls it Angelou's "praisesong" to "Porgy and Bess". Angelou's stereotypes about race and race relations are challenged as she interacts more with people of different races. During the course of this narrative, she changes her name from Marguerite Johnson to Maya Angelou for professional reasons. Her young son changes his name as well, from Clyde to Guy, and their relationship is strengthened as the book ends.

Angelou followed her first two installations of her autobiography, "<a href="I%20Know%20Why%20the%20Caged%20Bird%20Sings">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</a>" (1969) and "<a href="Gather%20Together%20in%20My%20Name">Gather Together in My Name</a>" (1974), with "Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas", published in 1976. It marked the first time a well-known African-American woman writer had expanded her life story into a third autobiography. She also published two volumes of poetry entitled "<a href="Just%20Give%20Me%20a%20Cool%20Drink%20of%20Water%20%27fore%20I%20Diiie">Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie</a>" (1971), which was nominated for a <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>, and "Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well" (1975).

According to writer <a href="Hilton%20Als">Hilton Als</a>, Angelou was one of the first African-American female writers to publicly discuss her personal life, and one of the first to use herself as a central character in her books. Writer <a href="Julian%20Mayfield">Julian Mayfield</a>, who calls "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" "a work of art that eludes description", states that Angelou's work set a precedent in describing "the black experience" and in African American literature as a whole.

Als calls Angelou one of the "pioneers of self-exposure", willing to focus honestly on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices. For example, while Angelou was composing her second autobiography, "<a href="Gather%20Together%20in%20My%20Name">Gather Together in My Name</a>", she was concerned about how her readers would react to her disclosure that she had been a prostitute. Her husband Paul Du Feu talked her into publishing the book by encouraging her to "tell the truth as a writer" and "be honest about it". Through the writing of her life stories, however, Angelou has become recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women. It made her, as scholar Joanne Braxton stated, "without a doubt ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer".

According to Angelou, the book's title came from the <a href="rent%20party">rent parties</a> of the 1920s and 1930s, where people would pay the host an inexpensive entry fee and then eat and drink throughout the weekend. As Angelou stated, people would "sing and swing and get merry like Christmas so one would have some fuel with which to live the rest of the week". These parties, also called "parlor socials", were attended by members of the working class who were unable to afford to go to Harlem's more expensive clubs. As critic Mary Jane Lupton stated, "The concept of the rent party helps describe Angelou's position ... She is a single mother from the South who goes to California and sings and swings for a living. She entertains others for little money as a singer, B-girl, and dancer, without getting very merry at all". Scholar Sondra O'Neale described the phrase as "a folkloric title symbolic of the author's long-deserved ascent to success and fulfillment".

Lupton insists that the title, one of the many <a href="similes">similes</a> Angelou used, is tied to the book's themes. Lupton also considered the title "ironic"; Angelou uses "old-fashioned" and "positive" words—"singin' " and "swingin' "—that reflect several meanings related to the text. These words describe the beginnings of Angelou's career as an entertainer, but the irony in the terms also depict the conflict Angelou felt about her son. The words "gettin' merry like Christmas" are also ironic: ""Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas" was Angelou's most unmerry autobiography". Because music is one of the book's themes, Angelou uses abbreviated verb endings in her title that reflect Black dialect and evoke the sound of a <a href="blues">blues</a> singer.

"Singin' and Swingin"' opens shortly after Angelou's previous autobiography, "<a href="Gather%20Together%20in%20My%20Name">Gather Together in My Name</a>". Marguerite, or Maya, a single mother with a young son, is in her early twenties, struggling to make a living. Angelou writes in this book, like her previous works, about the full range of her own experiences. As scholar Dolly McPherson states, "When one encounters Maya Angelou in her story, one encounters the humor, the pain, the exuberance, the honesty, and the determination of a human being who has experienced life fully and retained her strong sense of self". Many people around Angelou influence her growth and—as critic Lyman B. Hagen states—"propel Angelou ever forward". The book's opening chapters find Maya concerned with, as Hagen asserts, "apprehension about her son, a desire for a home, and facing racial conflicts, and seeking a career". Maya is offered a job as a salesgirl in a record shop on <a href="Fillmore%20Street">Fillmore Street</a> in San Francisco. At first she greets her white boss' offers of generosity and friendship with suspicion, but after two months of searching for evidence of racism, Maya begins to "relax and enjoy a world of music". The job allows her to move back into her mother's house and to spend more time with her son.

While working in the store, Maya meets Tosh Angelos, a Greek sailor. They fall in love, and he is especially fond of her son. Against her mother's wishes, Maya marries Tosh in 1952. At first, the marriage is satisfying, and it seems that Maya has fulfilled her dream of being a housewife, writing "My life began to resemble a "<a href="Good%20Housekeeping">Good Housekeeping</a>" advertisement." Eventually, Maya begins to resent Tosh's demands that she stay at home; she is also bothered by her friends' negative reaction to her interracial marriage. Maya is disturbed by Tosh's atheism and his control of her life, but does little to challenge his authority. After Tosh tells her son Clyde that there is no God, Maya rebels by secretly attending Black churches. After three years the marriage disintegrates when Tosh announces to Maya that he is "tired of being married". She goes into the hospital for an <a href="appendectomy">appendectomy</a>, and after the operation, she announces her desire to return to her grandmother in Stamps, but Tosh informs her that Annie died the day of Maya's operation.

A single mother once again, Maya begins to find success as a performer. She gets a job dancing and singing at <a href="The%20Purple%20Onion">The Purple Onion</a>, a popular nightclub in San Francisco, and—on the recommendation of the club's owners—she changes her name from Marguerite Johnson to the "more exotic" "Maya Angelou". She gains the attention of talent scouts, who offer her a role in "<a href="Porgy%20and%20Bess">Porgy and Bess</a>"; she turns down the part, however, because of her obligations to The Purple Onion. When her contract expires, Maya goes to New York City to audition for a part opposite <a href="Pearl%20Bailey">Pearl Bailey</a>, but she turns it down to join a European tour of "Porgy and Bess".

Leaving Clyde with her mother, Maya travels to 22 countries with the touring company in 1954 and 1955, expressing her impressions about her travels. She writes the following about <a href="Verona">Verona</a>: "I was really in Italy. Not Maya Angelou, the person of pretensions and ambitions, but me, Marguerite Johnson, who had read about Verona and <a href="Romeo%20and%20Juliet">the sad lovers</a> while growing up in a dusty Southern village poorer and more tragic than the historic town in which I now stood."

Despite Maya's success with "Porgy and Bess", she is racked with guilt and regret about leaving her son behind. After receiving bad news about Clyde's health, she quits the tour and returns to San Francisco. Both Clyde and Maya heal from the physical and emotional toll caused by their separation, and she promises never to leave him again. Clyde also announces that he wants to be called "Guy". As Angelou writes: "It took him only one month to train us. He became Guy and we could hardly remember ever calling him anything else".

Maya is true to her promise; she accepts a job performing in <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, and he goes with her. At the close of the book, mother and son express pride in each other. When he praises her singing, she writes: "Although I was not a great singer I was his mother, and he was my wonderful, dependently independent son".

All seven of Angelou's installments of her life story continue the tradition of African-American autobiography. Starting with "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings", Angelou makes a deliberate attempt while writing her books to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Her use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and thematic development has often led reviewers to categorize her books as <a href="autobiographical%20fiction">autobiographical fiction</a>. Angelou stated in a 1989 interview that she was the only "serious" writer to choose the genre to express herself. As critic Susan Gilbert states, Angelou reports not one person's story, but the collective's. Scholar <a href="Selwyn%20R.%20Cudjoe">Selwyn R. Cudjoe</a> agrees, and views Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that spoke for an entire group of people.

Lupton insists that all of Angelou's autobiographies conformed to the genre's standard structure: they were written by a single author, they were chronological, and they contained elements of character, technique, and theme. In a 1983 interview with African-American literature critic <a href="Claudia%20Tate">Claudia Tate</a>, Angelou calls her books autobiographies. When speaking of her unique use of the genre, Angelou acknowledges that she has followed the <a href="slave%20narrative">slave narrative</a> tradition of "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'".

Angelou recognizes that there are fictional aspects to all her books; she tended to "diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth". Her approach parallels the conventions of many African-American autobiographies written during the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> period in the US, when truth was often censored for purposes of self-protection. Author Lyman B. Hagen has placed Angelou in the long tradition of African-American autobiography, but insists that she has created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form. In a 1998 interview with journalist <a href="George%20Plimpton">George Plimpton</a>, Angelou discusses her writing process, and "the sometimes slippery notion of truth in nonfiction" and memoirs. When asked if she changed the truth to improve her story, she stated, "Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite of three or four people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about." Although Angelou has never admitted to changing fact in her stories, she has used the facts to make an impact with the reader. As Hagen states, "One can assume that 'the essence of the data' is present in Angelou's work". Hagen also states that Angelou "fictionalizes, to enhance interest". Angelou's long-time editor, <a href="Robert%20Loomis">Robert Loomis</a>, agrees, stating that she could rewrite any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader.

In "Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas", Angelou utilizes repetition as a literary technique. For example, she leaves her child in the care of his grandmother, just as her own mother left her and her older brother in the care of their grandmother in "Caged Bird." Much of "Singin' and Swingin′" delves into Angelou's guilt about accepting work that forces her to separate from her young son. As Angelou's friend, scholar Dolly McPherson states, "The saddest part of "Singin' and Swingin' " is the young Guy, who, though deeply loved by Angelou, seems to be shoved into the background whenever a need to satisfy her monetary requirements or theatrical ambitions arises". Despite her great success traveling Europe with the "Porgy and Bess" tour, she is distressed and full of indecision. For every positive description of her European experiences, there is a lament about Guy that "shuts off" these experiences and prevents her from enjoying the fruit of her hard work.

Travel is a common theme in American autobiography as a whole; as McPherson states, it is something of a <a href="national%20myth">national myth</a> to Americans as a people. This is also the case for African American autobiography, which has its roots in the <a href="slave%20narrative">slave narrative</a>. Like those narratives that focus on the writers' search for freedom from bondage, modern African American autobiographers like Angelou seek to develop "an authentic self" and the freedom to find it in their community. As McPherson states, "The journey to a distant goal, the return home, and the quest which involves the voyage out, achievement, and return are typical patterns in Black autobiography".

For Angelou, this quest takes her from her childhood and adolescence, as described in her first two books, into the adult world. McPherson sees "Singin' and Swingin"' as "a sunny tour of Angelou's twenties", from early years marked by disappointments and humiliation, into the broader world—to the white world and to the international community. This period describes "years of joy", as well as the start of Angelou's great success and fulfillment as an entertainer. Not all is "merry like Christmas", however; the book is also marked by negative events: her painful marriage and divorce, the death of her grandmother, and her long separation from her son.

In Angelou's first two volumes, the setting is limited to three places (Arkansas, Missouri, and California), while in "Singin' and Swingin"', the "setting breaks open" to include Europe as she travels with the "Porgy and Bess" company. Lupton states that Angelou's travel narrative, which takes up approximately 40 percent of the book, gives the book its organized structure, especially compared to "Gather Together in My Name", which is more chaotic. Angelou's observations about race, gender, and class serve to make the book more than a simple travel narrative. As a Black American, her travels around the world put her in contact with many nationalities and classes, expand her experiences beyond her familiar circle of community and family, and complicate her understandings of race relations.

In "Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas", Angelou continues an examination of her experiences with discrimination, begun in her first two volumes. Critic Selwyn R. Cudjoe refers to "the major problem of her works: what it means to be Black and female in America". Cudjoe divides "Singin' and Swingin' " into two parts; in the first part, Angelou works out her relationships with the white world, and in the second part, she evaluates her interactions with fellow Black cast members in "Porgy and Bess", as well as her encounters with Europe and Africa.

Angelou comes into intimate contact with whites for the first time—whites very different from the racist people she encountered in her childhood. She discovers, as Cudjoe puts it, that her stereotypes of Whites were developed to protect herself from their cruelty and indifference. As McPherson states, "Conditioned by earlier experiences, Angelou distrusts everyone, especially whites. Nevertheless, she is repeatedly surprised by the kindness and goodwill of many whites she meets, and, thus, her suspicions begin to soften into understanding". Cudjoe states that in "Singin' and Swingin' ", Angelou effectively demonstrates "the inviolability of the African American personhood", as well as her own closely guarded defense of it. In order for her to have any positive relationships with whites and people of other races, however, McPherson insists that Angelou "must examine and discard her stereotypical views about Whites". Lyman agrees and points out that Angelou must re-examine her lingering prejudices when faced with the broader world full of whites. As Hagen also states, however, this is a complex process, since most of Angelou's experiences with whites are positive during this time. Cudjoe states that as the book's main protagonist, Angelou moves between the white and Black worlds, both defining herself as a member of her community and encountering whites in "a much fuller, more sensuous manner".

In her third autobiography, Angelou is placed in circumstances that force her to change her opinions about whites, not an easy change for her. Louise Cox, the co-owner of the record store she frequents on Fillmore Street, generously offers Angelou employment and friendship. Angelou marries a white man, whose appreciation of Black music breaks her stereotype of whites. This is a difficult decision for Angelou, and she must justify it by rationalizing that Tosh is Greek, and not an American white. She was not marrying "one of the enemy", but she could not escape the embarrassment and shame when they encountered other Blacks. Later, she has a friendship among equals with her white co-workers, Jorie, Don, and Barrie, who assist her job quest at The Purple Onion. Cudjoe insists, "This free and equal relationship is significant to her in that it represents an important stage of her evolution toward adulthood".

Angelou's experiences with the "Porgy and Bess" tour expands her understanding of other races and race relations as she meets people of different nationalities during her travels. All these experiences are instrumental in Angelou's "movement toward adulthood" and serve as a basis for her later acceptance and tolerance of other races. "Porgy and Bess" has had a controversial history; many in the African American community consider it racist in its portrayal of Blacks. Angelou mentioned none of this controversy in "Singin' and Swingin', "however.

As Lupton states, there is "no doubt in the reader's mind about the importance of music" in "Singin' and Swingin"'. Angelou's use of opposition and her doubling of plot lines is similar to the <a href="polyphony">polyphonic rhythms</a> in jazz music. McPherson labels Angelou a "blues autobiographer", someone who, like a blues musician, includes the painful details and episodes from her life.

Music appears throughout Angelou's third autobiography, starting with the title, which evokes a blues song and references the beginnings of Angelou's career in music and performance. She starts "Singin' and Swingin' " the same way she starts "Caged Bird": with an epigraph to set the tone. Here, the epigraph is a quotation from an unidentified three-line stanza in classic <a href="blues">blues</a> form. After the epigraph, "music" is the first word in the book. As the story opens, a lonely Angelou finds solace in Black music, and is soon hired as a salesgirl in a record store on Fillmore Street in San Francisco. She meets and falls in love with her first husband after she discovers their shared appreciation of Black music. After learning of her grandmother's death, her reaction, "a dazzling passage three paragraphs long" according to Mary Jane Lupton, is musical; not only does it rely upon <a href="gospel%20music">gospel</a> tradition, but is also influenced by African American literary texts, especially <a href="James%20Weldon%20Johnson">James Weldon Johnson's</a> "Go Down Death—A Funeral Sermon".

After her divorce, Angelou earns a living for herself and her son with music and dance; this decision marks a turning point in her life. Angelou's new career seems, as Hagen asserts, to be propelled by a series of parties, evoking the title of this book. Hagen also calls her tour with "Porgy and Bess" "the biggest party by far of the book". McPherson calls "Singin' and Swingin"' "Angelou's praisesong" to the opera. Angelou has "fallen hopelessly in love with the musical", even turning down other job offers to tour with its European company. McPherson also calls "Porgy and Bess" "an antagonist that enthralls Angelou, beckoning and seducing her away from her responsibilities". As Lupton states, "Porgy and Bess" is Angelou's "foundation for her later performances in dance, theater, and song".

Conflict, or Angelou's presentation of opposites, is another theme in "Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas". As Lupton states, Angelou constructs a plot by mixing opposing incidences and attitudes - Angelou's "dialectical method". The book is full of conflicts: in Angelou's marriage, her feelings between being a good mother and a successful performer, the stereotypes about other races, and her new experiences with whites. Lupton believes this presentation of conflict is what makes Angelou's writing "brilliant"; she finds that the strength of "Singin' and Swingin' " comes, in part, from Angelou's duplication of conflicts underlying the plot, characters, and thought patterns in the book. Lupton adds, "Not many other contemporary autobiographers have been able to capture, either in a single volume or in a series, the opposition of desires that is found in "Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas" and, to a lesser extent, in Angelou's other volumes". Even the closing sentence of the book ("Although I was not a great singer I was his mother, and he was my wonderful, dependently independent son") demonstrates Angelou's dialectical construction, sums up the contradictions of Angelou's character, and alludes to mother/son patterns in her later books.

As Lupton states, motherhood is a "prevailing theme" throughout Angelou's autobiographies: "Angelou presents a rare kind of literary model, the working mother". Beginning in "Caged Bird", when she gives birth to her son, the emphasis Angelou places on this theme increases in importance. Angelou finds herself in a situation "very familiar to mothers with careers", and is forced to choose between being a loving mother or a "fully realized person". As scholar Sondra O'Neale puts it, in this book Angelou sheds the image of "unwed mother" with "a dead-end destiny" that had followed her throughout her previous autobiography.

Angelou's need for security for her young son motivates her choices in "Singin' and Swingin'," especially her decision to marry Tosh Angelos. She feels a deep sense of guilt and regret when she has to leave her son to tour with "Porgy and Bess", which prevents her from fully enjoying the experience. In spite of this, "Singin' and Swingin"' has been called "a love song to Angelou's son". Just as she changes her name as the story progresses, so does Guy, who becomes an intelligent, sensitive boy in the pages of this book. As Guy grows, so does his mother; Hagen stated that this growth moves Angelou's story forward. When Angelou discovers how deeply their separation injures Guy, she leaves the "Porgy and Bess" tour before it ends, at great personal cost. By the end of the book, their bond is deepened and she promises never to leave him again. As Hagen states, Maya embraces the importance of motherhood, just as she had done at the end of her previous autobiographies.

Like Angelou's two previous autobiographies, "Singin' and Swingin' " received mostly positive reviews. Kathryn Robinson of the "School Library Journal" predicts that the book would be as enthusiastically received as the earlier installments in Angelou's series, and that the author had succeeded in "sharing her vitality" with her audience. Linda Kuehl of the "<a href="Saturday%20Review%20%28US%20magazine%29">Saturday Review</a>", although she prefers the rhythm of "Caged Bird", found "Singin' and Swingin"' "very professional, even-toned, and ... quite engaging". Kuehl also finds that Angelou's story translates smoothly to the printed page. R.E. Almeida of the "<a href="Library%20Journal">Library Journal</a>" finds the book "a pleasant sequel", one in which Angelou's "religious strength, personal courage, and ... talent" was apparent in its pages.

One negative review was written by Margaret McFadden-Gerber in "Magill's Literary Annual", who found the book disappointing and felt that it lacked the power and introspection of Angelou's previous books. At least one reviewer expresses disappointment that Angelou did not use her status to effect any political change in "Singin' and Swingin'." Critic Lyman B. Hagen responds to this criticism by stating that Angelou's status during the events she describes in this autobiography did not lend itself to that kind of advocacy, and that as a person, Angelou had not evolved into the advocate that she would become later in her life. Reviewer John McWhorter finds many of the events Angelou describes throughout all of her autobiographies incoherent and confusing, and in need of further explanation as to her motives and reasons for her behavior. For example, McWhorter suggests that Angelou does a poor job of explaining her reasons for her marriage to Tosh Angelos, as well as their divorce. "In an autobiography in which a black woman marries outside of her race in the 1950s, we need to know more".

Trout Creek Mountains

The Trout Creek Mountains are a remote, semi-arid <a href="Great%20Basin">Great Basin</a> mountain range mostly in southeastern <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> and partially in northern <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> in the United States. The range's highest point is Orevada View Benchmark, above sea level, in Nevada. Disaster Peak, elevation , is another prominent summit in the Nevada portion of the mountains.

The mountains are characteristic of the Great Basin's topography of mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys. Oriented generally north to south, the Trout Creek Mountains consist primarily of <a href="fault%20block">fault block</a>s of <a href="basalt">basalt</a>, which came from an ancient volcano and other vents, on top of older <a href="metamorphic%20rock">metamorphic rock</a>s. The southern end of the range, however, features many <a href="Granite">granitic</a> <a href="outcrop">outcrop</a>s. As a whole, the <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29">faulted</a> terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by <a href="escarpment">escarpment</a>s and canyons.

Most of the range is public land administered by the federal <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a>. There is very little human development in the remote region—<a href="cattle">cattle</a> grazing and ranching are the primary human uses—but former mines at the <a href="McDermitt%20Caldera">McDermitt Caldera</a> produced some of the largest amounts of <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> in North America in the 20th century. Public lands in the mountains are open to recreation but are rarely visited. Vegetation includes large swaths of <a href="Artemisia%20tridentata">big sagebrush</a> in addition to desert grasses and <a href="Populus%20sect.%20Aegiros">cottonwood</a> and <a href="alder">alder</a> stands. <a href="Sage%20grouse">Sage grouse</a> and <a href="mountain%20chickadee">mountain chickadee</a> are two bird species native to the range, and common mammals include <a href="pronghorn">pronghorn</a> and <a href="jackrabbit">jackrabbit</a>s.

Despite the area's dry climate, a few year-round streams provide habitat for the rare <a href="Lahontan%20cutthroat%20trout">Lahontan cutthroat trout</a>. Fish populations in the Trout Creek Mountains declined throughout much of the 20th century. In the 1980s, the effects of <a href="grazing">grazing</a> allotments on <a href="riparian%20zone">riparian zone</a>s and the fish led to land-use conflict. The Trout Creek Mountain Working Group was formed in 1988 to help resolve disagreements among livestock owners, environmentalists, government agencies, and other interested parties. The stakeholders met and agreed on changes to land-use practices, and since the early 1990s, riparian zones have begun to recover.

The Trout Creek Mountains are in a very remote area of southeastern Oregon and northern Nevada, in <a href="Harney%20County%2C%20Oregon">Harney</a> and <a href="Humboldt%20County%2C%20Nevada">Humboldt</a> counties. The nearest human settlements are the <a href="Whitehorse%20Ranch">Whitehorse Ranch</a>, about directly north from the middle of the mountains; <a href="Fields%2C%20Oregon">Fields, Oregon</a>, about to the northwest; <a href="Denio%2C%20Nevada">Denio, Nevada</a>, about to the west; and <a href="McDermitt%2C%20Nevada%E2%80%93Oregon">McDermitt, Nevada–Oregon</a>, about to the east. The mountains are about directly southwest of <a href="Boise%2C%20Idaho">Boise, Idaho</a>, and about northeast of <a href="Reno%2C%20Nevada">Reno, Nevada</a>.

The range and surrounding non-mountainous areas cover an area of . The mountains run north to south and east to west. More of the range is in Oregon (78%) than in Nevada (22%). The highest point in the range is Orevada View Benchmark, which is above sea level and is located in Nevada about one mile south of the Oregon border. About two miles southeast of Orevada View is Disaster Peak, "a large, symmetrical butte that is visible throughout the region." At , Disaster Peak anchors the southern end of the mountains in a sub-range called The Granites.

The <a href="Oregon%20Canyon%20Mountains">Oregon Canyon Mountains</a> border the Trout Creek Mountains on the east along the Harney–<a href="Malheur%20County%2C%20Oregon">Malheur</a> county line (according to the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a>'s definitions), while the <a href="Pueblo%20Mountains">Pueblo Mountains</a> are the next range west of the Trout Creek Mountains. The <a href="Bilk%20Creek%20Mountains">Bilk Creek Mountains</a> in both Oregon and Nevada border the Trout Creek Mountains on the southwest; the two ranges are separated by Log Cabin Creek and South Fork Cottonwood Creek. South of the Trout Creek Mountains is the <a href="Kings%20River%20%28Nevada%29">Kings River Valley</a>, which separates the Bilk Creek Mountains on the west from the <a href="Montana%20Mountains">Montana Mountains</a> on the east.

The terrain in the Trout Creek Mountains varies from broad, flat basins and rolling ridges to high rock <a href="escarpment">escarpment</a>s cut by deep canyons. The canyons have steep walls with loose <a href="Scree">talus slopes</a> at the bottoms. There are meadows around <a href="Spring%20%28hydrosphere%29">spring</a>s in the mountains, although most streams in the range do not flow year-round. Major streams that flow off the north slopes of the mountains include (from west to east) Cottonwood Creek, Trout Creek, Willow Creek, and Whitehorse Creek. These streams all flow into <a href="endorheic%20basin">endorheic basin</a>s in Harney County, Oregon. Trout Creek and Whitehorse Creek are the largest of the four. The Kings River and McDermitt Creek each drain an area on the south slopes of the Trout Creek Mountains. The Kings River begins in The Granites and flows south into Nevada, where it meets the <a href="Quinn%20River">Quinn River</a>, which evaporates in the <a href="Black%20Rock%20Desert">Black Rock Desert</a>. McDermitt Creek begins in Oregon a few miles north of The Granites and flows generally east, crossing the Oregon–Nevada border five times before disappearing into the floor of the Quinn River Valley south of McDermitt.

The mountains lie within the <a href="Basin%20and%20Range%20Province">Basin and Range Province</a> or <a href="Great%20Basin">Great Basin</a> of the <a href="Western%20United%20States">Western United States</a>, which is characterized by a series of parallel <a href="fault%20block">fault block</a>s that form long north–south mountain ranges separated by wide, high-desert valleys. The Trout Creek Mountains are uplifted and tilted blocks with steep escarpments along the southern and eastern sides of the range. The southern area of the range, known as The Granites, has numerous <a href="outcrop">outcrop</a>pings of <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> age <a href="granite">granite</a>. These granite outcrops are commonly found in the eroded valleys below the volcanic ridgelines.

The Trout Creek Mountains are composed mostly of <a href="basalt">basalt</a> from a <a href="shield%20volcano">shield volcano</a> that once stood where <a href="Steens%20Mountain">Steens Mountain</a> is today. Crustal thinning and the <a href="Yellowstone%20hotspot">Yellowstone hotspot</a>, which was then beneath southeastern Oregon, induced eruptions from Steens and nearby vents about 17 million years ago, in the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>. The vents produced a series of <a href="lava">lava</a> flows that spread across the land now known as the Trout Creek Mountains. Eruptions from the Steens volcano lasted for about one million years, and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred. Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older <a href="metamorphic%20rock">metamorphic rock</a>s that may be related to some of the <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> age formations of the <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28Pacific%20Northwest%29">Blue Mountains</a> in northeastern Oregon. Within these metamorphic rocks are <a href="diorite">diorite</a> and <a href="granodiorite">granodiorite</a> <a href="Intrusive%20rock">intrusive bodies</a> which were presumably intruded during the Cretaceous Period.

The broad <a href="McDermitt%20Caldera">McDermitt Caldera</a> is a prominent geologic feature in the Trout Creek Mountains. The oval-shaped <a href="caldera">caldera</a> is a collapsed <a href="lava%20dome">lava dome</a> that straddles the Oregon–Nevada border on the eastern side of the range and south of the Oregon Canyon Mountains. It is about long and wide. The lava dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early Miocene. A total of five large <a href="ash%20flow">ash flow</a>s were produced along with a large <a href="rhyolite">rhyolite</a> dome structure. The caldera formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago. The caldera contains significant <a href="ore%20deposit">ore deposit</a>s, and <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> and <a href="uranium">uranium</a> have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the caldera. Other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of <a href="antimony">antimony</a>, <a href="Caesium">cesium</a>, and <a href="lithium">lithium</a>.

The Trout Creek Mountains are <a href="Semi-arid%20climate">semi-arid</a> because they are in the eastern <a href="rain%20shadow">rain shadow</a> of mountain ranges to the west. When moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward over the Oregon and <a href="California">California</a> coastal ranges and the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a>, most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the Trout Creek Mountains. As a result, the average annual precipitation in the Trout Creek Mountains is only per year, with most areas receiving between annually. Much of the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning of March and the end of June. Most of the rest falls as snow during the fall and winter months. Snowpack at elevations below usually melts by April; however, at the higher elevations, snow can remain until mid-June. Local flooding often occurs in the spring as the snowpack melts.

The <a href="prevailing%20winds">prevailing winds</a> are from the west-southwest, and they are normally strongest in March and April. Brief, intense thunderstorms are common between April and October. Thunderstorms in the summer months tend to be more isolated and often produce <a href="dry%20lightning">dry lightning</a> strikes.

Vegetation in the Trout Creek Mountains is dominated by <a href="Artemisia%20tridentata">big sagebrush</a> and desert grasses. Other common shrubs include <a href="bitterbrush">bitterbrush</a>, <a href="snowberry">snowberry</a>, and "<a href="Ceanothus">Ceanothus</a>". There are also patches of <a href="Cercocarpus">mountain mahogany</a> in some areas. Common grass species include <a href="Idaho%20fescue">Idaho fescue</a>, <a href="bluebunch%20wheatgrass">bluebunch wheatgrass</a>, <a href="cheatgrass">cheatgrass</a>, <a href="Achnatherum%20occidentale">western needlegrass</a>, <a href="Sandberg%27s%20bluegrass">Sandberg's bluegrass</a>, <a href="Thurber%27s%20needlegrass">Thurber's needlegrass</a>, and <a href="bottlebrush%20squirreltail">bottlebrush squirreltail</a>, as well as <a href="basin%20wildrye">basin wildrye</a> in some well-drained areas.

Less than one percent of the range consists of meadow wetlands and <a href="Riparian%20zone">riparian greenways</a> (vegetation along stream banks). However, these areas are vital to the local ecosystem. The meadows surround springs, which are mostly on gently sloping uplands or in stream bottoms, and range in size from about . Narrow riparian greenways follow the year-round streams. Many greenway areas have <a href="quaking%20aspen">quaking aspen</a> and <a href="willow">willow</a> groves. <a href="Populus%20sect.%20Aegiros">Cottonwood</a> and <a href="alder">alder</a> groves can be found at lower elevations where terrain is flatter and stream channels are wider. <a href="Cyperaceae">Sedges</a> and <a href="Juncaceae">rushes</a> are also native to these stream bottoms. Years of heavy livestock grazing in parts of the range resulted in the loss of some grass species, riparian vegetation, and young aspen and willow trees. Restoration of riparian areas began in the early 1970s, and plans to reduce grazing were implemented in the 1980s and early 1990s. However, large wildfires in southeastern Oregon during the summer of 2012 burned much of the range's vegetation, damaging riparian ecosystems and killing hundreds of grazing cattle.

Animals in the Trout Creek Mountains are adapted to the environment of the <a href="High%20Desert%20%28Oregon%29">High Desert</a>. <a href="Pronghorn">Pronghorn</a> are common in the open, sagebrush-covered basins, while <a href="mule%20deer">mule deer</a> live in the cottonwood and willow groves. There are also <a href="bighorn%20sheep">bighorn sheep</a>, <a href="cougar">cougar</a>s, and <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>s in the high country. <a href="Jackrabbit">Jackrabbit</a>s and <a href="coyote">coyote</a>s are prevalent throughout the range. <a href="Mustang">Mustang</a>s sometimes pass through the mountains as they roam the Great Basin. Some other mammals include the <a href="northern%20pocket%20gopher">northern pocket gopher</a>, <a href="mountain%20cottontail">mountain cottontail</a>, and <a href="Belding%27s%20ground%20squirrel">Belding's ground squirrel</a>. <a href="North%20American%20beaver">North American beaver</a>s live in and along streams, as do <a href="Pacific%20tree%20frog">Pacific tree frog</a>s, <a href="Spea%20hammondii">western spadefoot toads</a>, and <a href="garter%20snake">garter snake</a>s. Native bird species include the <a href="sage%20grouse">sage grouse</a>, <a href="mountain%20chickadee">mountain chickadee</a>, <a href="gray-headed%20junco">gray-headed junco</a>, <a href="Black-throated%20grey%20warbler">black-throated gray warbler</a>, <a href="Virginia%27s%20warbler">Virginia's warbler</a>, <a href="MacGillivray%27s%20warbler">MacGillivray's warbler</a>, <a href="pine%20siskin">pine siskin</a>, <a href="red%20crossbill">red crossbill</a>, <a href="American%20bushtit">bushtit</a>, <a href="hermit%20thrush">hermit thrush</a>, <a href="northern%20goshawk">northern goshawk</a>, and species of <a href="raven">raven</a> and <a href="eagle">eagle</a>.

Several streams in the Trout Creek Mountains are home to trout, including the rare <a href="Lahontan%20cutthroat%20trout">Lahontan cutthroat trout</a> subspecies. These include Willow Creek, Whitehorse Creek, Little Whitehorse Creek, Doolittle Creek, Fifteen Mile Creek, Indian Creek, Sage Canyon Creek, Line Canyon Creek, and some tributaries of McDermitt Creek. Lahontan cutthroat trout live in small, isolated populations that are often confined to individual streams, many of them in the Trout Creek Mountains. These populations have significant <a href="gene">gene</a>tic differences due to their history of isolation. For most of the 20th century, the trout's numbers declined considerably. It was listed under federal law as an <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a> in 1970 and was reclassified as <a href="Threatened%20species">threatened</a> in 1975. Reasons for the fish's decline included habitat degradation from cattle grazing, drought, overfishing, competition with other fish, and <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridization</a> with introduced <a href="rainbow%20trout">rainbow trout</a>, which decreased the number of genetically pure Lahontan cutthroat trout. However, reductions in cattle grazing in riparian zones since the 1980s allowed fish habitat and populations to start to recover.

The <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a> (BLM) administers most land in the Trout Creek Mountains, but there are also some private lands and some roads in the area. The private lands are mainly used for ranching along mountain streams, while the BLM lands include large grazing allotments for local ranchers' cattle. At least 100 <a href="Mineral%20rights">mining claims</a> in the mountains have been recorded since 1892, some of which were staked for gold exploration. Commercial mining has occurred in some areas, mostly near the McDermitt Caldera, where uranium and large amounts of mercury have been extracted. Mines in what was called the Opalite Mining District produced 270,000 flasks of mercury—"the richest supply of mercury in the western hemisphere"—from <a href="cinnabar">cinnabar</a> extracted from the caldera in the 20th century. The two leading mercury-producing mines in North America were the Cordero and McDermitt mines on the edge of the caldera in Nevada. Together, they operated from 1933 to 1989. The McDermitt Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed three years later, in 1992. However, mineral exploration has continued at the Cordero Mine in the 21st century, and waste containing mercury and <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a> was returned there from the community of McDermitt as part of a <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a> cleanup project.

The entire mountain range is very remote; as a result, there are few visitors, and the range offers a wilderness-like experience. Camping, hunting, fishing, and hiking are the most popular activities. The only developed recreation site nearby is at Willow Creek Hot Springs, just south of the <a href="Whitehorse%20Ranch">Whitehorse Ranch</a>, where nearby there are miles of trails designated for <a href="Off-roading">four-wheel off-road vehicles</a>. Hunters come to the mountains seeking trophy mule deer, pronghorn, <a href="Chukar%20partridge">chukar</a>s, and rabbits. Fishing on some streams is sometimes permitted on a <a href="Catch%20and%20release">catch-and-release</a> basis. The mountains are also suitable for hiking cross-country or on game trails in natural corridors along canyons and creek bottoms. There are more than 100 archaeological sites in the range that document use by <a href="Northern%20Paiute">Northern Paiute</a> people as long as 7,000 years ago.

Cattle grazing in the Trout Creek Mountains began in the late 19th century, and the BLM currently oversees grazing allotments in the area. Cattle can be found grazing in some areas during the spring and summer months. The effects of grazing on the local environment were the subject of controversy in the 1980s.

By the 1970s and 1980s, a century of intense cattle grazing had reduced much of the riparian vegetation along stream banks in the Trout Creek Mountains and elsewhere in the Great Basin. As a result, stream banks were eroding and upland vegetation was encroaching into riparian zones. Aspen populations declined as grazing cattle eliminated young trees, decreasing shade over streams and raising water temperatures. These conditions put the rare Lahontan cutthroat trout population at risk. Since the Lahontan was officially designated as a threatened species, environmental groups began advocating the cancellation of grazing permits in the Trout Creek Mountains.

Beginning in the early 1970s, the Bureau of Land Management identified damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas. Approximately 20,000 willow trees were planted along streams, small dams were put together to create more pools in the streams, and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing. Next, the agency sought to reform land-use plans to change grazing practices, which became a complex and controversial project.

As environmentalists pressed the BLM to close much of the Trout Creek Mountains to grazing, frustrated ranchers joined the <a href="Sagebrush%20Rebellion">Sagebrush Rebellion</a> seeking to protect their grazing allotments. Initially, it appeared that the issue of grazing in the range would produce prolonged <a href="litigation">litigation</a> with appeals potentially lasting decades. However, in 1988, interest groups representing all sides of the issue joined to form the Trout Creek Mountain Working Group. The group's goal was to find a solution acceptable to everyone—a plan that would protect both the land's ecological health and ranchers' economic needs.

Initial members of the Trout Creek Mountain Working Group included:

Over the next several years, the group continued to meet and discuss options for restoring the land while meeting the economic needs of local ranchers. Meetings were all open to the public.

The group eventually endorsed a grazing management plan that provided for both the ecological health of sensitive riparian areas and the economic well-being of ranchers. In 1989, the Whitehorse Ranch agreed to rest two grazing allotments totaling to restore critical stream greenways and mountain pastures. The ranch's allotment on Fifteen Mile Creek was rested for three years, and its Willow Creek pasture received a five-year rest before grazing was resumed. In addition, the grazing season in mountain pastures was reduced from four months to two, and the total number of cattle released in the allotment areas was reduced from 3,800 to 2,200. Finally, sensitive areas were fenced to protect them from cattle, and additional water sources were constructed away from streams. Other ranches also agreed to rest specific pastures including the Trout Creek, Cottonwood Creek, and Whitehorse Butte allotments.

In 1991, the Bureau of Land Management approved a new grazing allotment management plan. It was based on the agreements made by the Trout Creek Mountain Working Group, and it took effect in 1992. Since then, vegetation in riparian areas of the Trout Creek Mountains has recovered, and studies by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service have found that the Lahontan cutthroat trout population, still listed as threatened, is also recovering.

The Political Cesspool is a weekly <a href="far-right">far-right</a> <a href="talk%20radio">talk radio</a> show founded by <a href="Tennessee">Tennessean</a> political activist James Edwards and syndicated by the organizations Liberty News Radio Network and <a href="Accent%20Radio%20Network">Accent Radio Network</a> in the United States. First broadcast in October 2004 twice a week from radio station <a href="WMQM">WMQM</a>, per Edwards it has been <a href="simulcast">simulcast</a> on Stormfront Radio, a service of the <a href="white%20nationalist">white nationalist</a> <a href="Stormfront%20%28website%29">Stormfront</a> website and as of 2011 is broadcast on Saturday nights on <a href="WLRM">WLRM</a>, a <a href="Christian%20radio">Christian</a> radio station in <a href="Millington%2C%20Tennessee">Millington, Tennessee</a>. Its sponsors include the <a href="white%20separatism">white separatist</a> <a href="Council%20of%20Conservative%20Citizens">Council of Conservative Citizens</a> and the <a href="Institute%20for%20Historical%20Review">Institute for Historical Review</a>, a <a href="Holocaust%20denial">Holocaust denial</a> group.

According to its statement of principles, the show stands for the "Dispossessed Majority" and represents "a philosophy that is pro-White." It has attracted criticism—including from "<a href="The%20Nation%20%28magazine%29">The Nation</a>", "<a href="The%20New%20Republic">The New Republic</a>", the <a href="Stephen%20Roth%20Institute">Stephen Roth Institute</a>, the <a href="Southern%20Poverty%20Law%20Center">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC), and the <a href="Anti-Defamation%20League">Anti-Defamation League</a>—for its promotion of <a href="antisemitism">anti-semitic</a>, <a href="white%20nationalism">white nationalist</a> and <a href="white%20supremacy">white supremacist</a> views. According to the SPLC, the show has featured a "Who's Who of the radical right", including members of the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>; they say Edwards has probably done more than anyone in America to promote neo-Nazis, Holocaust deniers and other extremists.

The show features Edwards and his co-hosts Keith Alexander, Bill Rolen, Winston Smith, and Eddie Miller, as well as producer Art Frith. Former staffers include Geoff Melton, Jess Bonds and co-founder Austin Farley. Its guests have included author <a href="Jerome%20Corsi">Jerome Corsi</a>, <a href="Minuteman%20Project">Minuteman Project</a> leader <a href="Jim%20Gilchrist">Jim Gilchrist</a>, former <a href="Constitution%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Constitution Party</a> presidential candidate <a href="Michael%20Peroutka">Michael Peroutka</a>, actor <a href="Sonny%20Landham">Sonny Landham</a>, <a href="British%20National%20Party">British National Party</a> leader <a href="Nick%20Griffin">Nick Griffin</a>, <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a> secessionist <a href="Thomas%20Naylor">Thomas Naylor</a>, and <a href="paleoconservative">paleoconservative</a> activist <a href="Pat%20Buchanan">Pat Buchanan</a>. It is carried by at least three licensed terrestrial radio stations in the United States and on network feeds on the <a href="Galaxy%2019">Galaxy 19</a> communications satellite.

Edwards is a <a href="Far-right%20politics">far-right</a> political activist from <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a rising star of the modern white-nationalist movement. They write that he is articulate, charming, and at ease in front of the public, as well as in television and radio studios. He attended <a href="Briarcrest%20Christian%20School">Briarcrest Christian School</a>, a private school in Memphis, and in ninth grade transferred into a Christian-nationalist homeschooling program, a decision that he said led him into political activism. In 2000 he volunteered for Pat Buchanan's <a href="Pat%20Buchanan%232000%20presidential%20campaign">presidential campaign</a>, and in 2002 ran unsuccessfully for the <a href="Tennessee%20House%20of%20Representatives">Tennessee House of Representatives</a>. It was during this campaign that he met fellow activist Austin Farley, who was on the ballot against him. In October of that year, he and Farley established "The Political Cesspool".

In 2007, Edwards was part of a panel that appeared on <a href="CNN">CNN</a>'s "<a href="Paula%20Zahn%20Now">Paula Zahn Now</a>", along with <a href="Roland%20S.%20Martin">Roland S. Martin</a> and <a href="Jesse%20Lee%20Peterson">Jesse Lee Peterson</a>. The purpose was to discuss <a href="racial%20segregation">racial segregation</a> in American cities. He told Zahn that white children should seek out those who share "the same values and traditions and heroes," and that "forced integration" was a "march toward <a href="totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a>." He said: "Crime and violence follow African-Americans wherever they go, and if you think that is racist, then spend some time on the mean streets of south Memphis." Martin described his remarks as unfit for national television. Edwards made a second appearance on "Paula Zahn Now" in 2009, during which he said: "Whites are in for the fight of their lives. America is becoming <a href="Balkanization">balkanized</a>. We are being robbed of having a future in the very nation our ancestors carved from the wilderness."

In 2010, he became involved with a new party, the <a href="American%20Freedom%20Party">American Freedom Party</a>, which advocates white nationalism and a form of <a href="economic%20nationalism">economic nationalism</a> known as the <a href="Third%20Position">Third Position</a>.

Other staff at "The Political Cesspool" include Bill Rolen, Eddie "The Bombardier" Miller, Keith Alexander, and Winston Smith. According to the show's website, most of the staff claim descent from <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> soldiers. The show was initially broadcast on AM 1600 <a href="WMQM">WMQM</a>, a Memphis-based radio station, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Edwards and Farley invited friends Bill Rolen, a board member of the <a href="Council%20of%20Conservative%20Citizens">Council of Conservative Citizens</a>, and Jess Bonds as guest hosts, as well as radio technician Art Frith. Frith had previously worked for a number of other radio stations including <a href="American%20Forces%20Network">American Forces Radio and Television Service</a> (AFRTS) (in <a href="Keflavik%2C%20Iceland">Keflavik, Iceland</a>; <a href="Anchorage%2C%20Alaska">Anchorage, Alaska</a>; and <a href="Nea%20Makri%2C%20Greece">Nea Makri, Greece</a>), <a href="KFQD">KFQD</a> (in Anchorage), and <a href="WTOU">WBCK</a> (in <a href="Battle%20Creek%2C%20Michigan">Battle Creek, Michigan</a>).

In 2005 the group moved to WMQM's Millington-based sister station, AM 1380 <a href="WLRM">WLRM</a>, and switched to a nightly schedule, Monday through Friday. Farley left the program in November of that year. Two years later, Geoff Melton, a former co-host, joined to help set up the show's website and the show entered syndication with Dixie Broadcasting Radio Network. The program went on hiatus on February 15, 2008, because staff members said they needed a break, but returned to the airwaves in June 2008 on WLRM on Saturday nights. One year later, it switched from <a href="Republic%20Broadcasting%20Network">Republic Broadcasting Network</a> to Liberty News Radio Network. As of August 2009, Bonds and Melton are no longer affiliated with the program. Frith now lives in <a href="Nashville%2C%20Michigan">Nashville, Michigan</a>, but remains a part of the show's staff. Since WLRM is not audited by <a href="Arbitron">Arbitron</a>, the show's ratings are unknown. The show is listener-supported and, according to Edwards, receives more donations from Florida than from any other state.

"The Political Cesspool" describes its philosophy as "pro-White" and "against political centralization". Its statement of principles, with material borrowed from the <a href="Council%20of%20Conservative%20Citizens">Council of Conservative Citizens</a>, reads:

"The Political Cesspool" has over the years featured many guest appearances, including political activists, <a href="Holocaust%20denial">Holocaust deniers</a>, economists, and musicians. Former Tennessee <a href="gubernatorial">gubernatorial</a> candidate Carl "Twofeathers" Whitaker, who claims partial <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native-American</a> ancestry and is known for his strong support of the <a href="Minuteman%20Project">Minuteman</a> movement, has appeared on the show, as has conservative Native-American activist David Yeagley. Filmmakers <a href="Merlin%20Miller">Merlin Miller</a> ("<a href="A%20Place%20to%20Grow">A Place to Grow</a>", "<a href="Jericho%20%282001%20film%29">Jericho</a>"), who is the 2012 presidential nominee of the <a href="American%20Freedom%20Party">American Freedom Party</a>, and Craig Bodeker ("A Conversation about Race") have featured.

Author <a href="Jerome%20Corsi">Jerome Corsi</a> was interviewed in July 2008. During the discussion he spoke about his financial newsletter, and promoted his book "<a href="The%20Obama%20Nation">The Obama Nation</a>", which includes several statements that have been widely described as racist; for example, he opined that <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">US President</a> <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> identifies more with his "African blood" than his American roots and that the President "rejects everyone white, including his mother and his grandparents". Corsi scheduled another promotional appearance on "The Political Cesspool", but one month later he canceled this appearance, citing "travel plans that changed". Edwards said that he believed the incident "just goes to show what incredible pressure everyone in public life is under to never have anything to do with anyone who speaks up for the interests of white people." Fellow authors <a href="John%20Derbyshire">John Derbyshire</a> and <a href="Steve%20Sailer">Steve Sailer</a> have also been guests. In July 2011, <a href="WorldNetDaily">WorldNetDaily</a> columnist Ilana Mercer appeared on the show.

<a href="Constitution%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Constitution Party</a> nominee <a href="Michael%20Peroutka">Michael Peroutka</a> used his appearance in 2004 to promote his presidential campaign. Party member Michael Goza described the show as "Christian/Constitutionalist", and "a great blessing to our cause". <a href="Thomas%20Naylor">Thomas Naylor</a>, of the Vermont <a href="secessionist">secessionist</a> organization <a href="Second%20Vermont%20Republic">Second Vermont Republic</a>, appeared on the show to celebrate <a href="Confederate%20History%20Month">Confederate History Month</a> in April 2007, while American Freedom Party Chairman Bill Johnson appeared to promote his party.

On May 8, 2006, Minuteman Project leader <a href="Jim%20Gilchrist">Jim Gilchrist</a> spoke on the program. Co-host Bill Rolen agreed with Gilchrist's view that illegal immigrants' intentions are to "just squat here and plunder whatever social benefits our programs provide them". However, Rolen disagreed with Gilchrist's claim that illegal immigration was "the 21st century <a href="slave%20trade%20%28Americas%29">slave trade</a>". Gilchrist's colleague in the Minuteman movement, <a href="Chris%20Simcox">Chris Simcox</a>, has also been a guest of the show.

Paul Babeu, the sheriff of <a href="Pinal%20County%2C%20Arizona">Pinal County, Arizona</a>, appeared on "The Political Cesspool" on July 10, 2010 to discuss illegal immigration; during the interview, he referred to James Edwards as a "great American". Less than two weeks later, Babeu's spokesman issued an apology, saying that he had not researched the show thoroughly enough before scheduling the interview and that Babeu has a policy of not conducting interviews with hate groups. Babeu himself said that he was "hoodwinked" into appearing on the show and that he rejects "any hate or bigotry". Prior to the interview, cohost Eddie Miller said that "Of all the people we’ve interviewed on this radio show, I would say the only people that came close to getting me this excited was Dr. David Duke." Following Babeu's spokesman's apology, Edwards alleged that Babeu was aware of the show's true ideology prior to appearing on the show, saying: "For Sheriff Babeu to change his mind and now regret coming on our show, for whatever reason, is his right. For him to act as though he had no idea of our ideology is a lie." As a result of the controversy surrounding Babeu's appearance on the show, Arizona <a href="U.S.%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> candidate <a href="J.%20D.%20Hayworth">J. D. Hayworth</a> asked his primary opponent, <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a>, to drop several campaign ads featuring McCain and Babeu. In 2011, another sheriff, Dennis Spruell of <a href="Montezuma%20County%2C%20Colorado">Montezuma County, Colorado</a>, also apologized after appearing on the show without knowing its actual agenda.

Paleoconservative activist and former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan has appeared twice as of 2011. In a June 2008 interview initiated and arranged by his publicist, he promoted his book "<a href="Churchill%2C%20Hitler%20and%20the%20Unnecessary%20War">Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War</a>". During the broadcast, Buchanan defended <a href="Charles%20Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a> against charges of antisemitism, stating that his reputation "has been blackened because of a single speech he gave and a couple of paragraphs in it where he said that ... the Jewish community is beating the drums for war but frankly, no one has said what he said was palpably untrue." At the end of the interview, James Edwards said, "Mr. Buchanan, thank you so much for coming back on our program, for fighting for our people." Previously, in September 2006, Buchanan had made an appearance to promote his book "<a href="State%20of%20Emergency%20%28book%29">State of Emergency</a>"; during this interview, he said that "we are being invaded by people of different cultures" and argued that Americans "cannot survive a bifurcated culture or a heavily Hispanicized culture, tilted towards <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> ... I think that's the beginning of the end of the United States."
Self-proclaimed "<a href="Scientific%20racism">racial realist</a>" <a href="Jared%20Taylor">Jared Taylor</a>, whom James Edwards considers to be a close friend, has appeared on at least ten occasions. In an article he wrote for "<a href="VDARE">VDARE</a>", Taylor described the program as "racially oriented". Although describing itself as "America First", the show has also hosted foreign guests, including <a href="Croatian%20people">Croatian</a> white nationalist <a href="Tomislav%20Suni%C4%87">Tomislav Sunić</a>, Australian white nationalist <a href="Drew%20Fraser">Drew Fraser</a>, Russian <a href="Austrian%20School">Austrian School</a> economist Yuri N. Maltsev, British lawyer <a href="Adrian%20Davies%20%28barrister%29">Adrian Davies</a>, Canadian white supremacist <a href="Paul%20Fromm%20%28activist%29">Paul Fromm</a>, Canadian conservative blogger <a href="Kathy%20Shaidle">Kathy Shaidle</a>, and <a href="British%20National%20Party">British National Party</a> (BNP) leaders <a href="Simon%20Darby">Simon Darby</a> and <a href="Nick%20Griffin">Nick Griffin</a>; Griffin appeared as a guest before and after his election to the <a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament</a>. During his post-election appearance, Griffin attributed the BNP's electoral successes to a fear of "creeping process of <a href="Islamification">Islamification</a>".

Actor <a href="Mel%20Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>'s father, <a href="Hutton%20Gibson">Hutton Gibson</a>, has also appeared on the show. During his appearance, he referred to <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> as a "homosexual" and claimed that "half the people in the <a href="Holy%20See">Vatican</a> are <a href="queer">queer</a>."

The show has frequently been criticised by anti-racist groups and individuals (such as the <a href="Southern%20Poverty%20Law%20Center">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC), <a href="Anti-Defamation%20League">Anti-Defamation League</a> (ADL), <a href="Stephen%20Roth%20Institute">Stephen Roth Institute</a>, and journalist <a href="Max%20Blumenthal">Max Blumenthal</a>) over its stated ideology. "The Political Cesspool" was added to the Southern Poverty Law Center's <a href="hate%20group">hate group</a> watch list in 2006. James Edwards was "ecstatic", saying "I don't think you've arrived in the conservative movement until you've made it to the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hate Watch". Edwards describes the SPLC as a group composed of "communists and civil rights hustlers". The SPLC's Hatewatch has referred to "The Political Cesspool" as "an overtly racist, anti-Semitic radio show hosted by [a] self-avowed white nationalist" and as "the nexus of hate in America". The Anti-Defamation League has also criticized the show; Edwards has attacked the ADL as "America's most powerful hate group" and has claimed that its definition of a "neo-Nazi [is] any white person who disagrees with a Jew".

Author <a href="John%20Avlon">John Avlon</a>, a former speechwriter for <a href="Rudy%20Giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a>, has described "The Political Cesspool" as "avowedly white supremacist".
Investigative journalist Max Blumenthal, who reported on an attempt by one of the show's staff to advertise at a rally for <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> vice-presidential candidate <a href="Sarah%20Palin">Sarah Palin</a>, described "The Political Cesspool" as having a "racist ideology", and highlighted anti-Semitic, racist, and <a href="homophobia">homophobic</a> comments that Edwards had made on his blog. The Stephen Roth Institute has also commented on the show, noting that "[James] Edwards openly espoused many of his guests' views and during speeches to extremist audiences, including members of the white supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens and the racist <a href="League%20of%20the%20South">League of the South</a>, he gained the support of a wide array of extremists." In an article about antisemitism in <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, the Institute commented on the show's interview with <a href="Filip%20Dewinter">Filip Dewinter</a>, a member of the Belgian Parliament and a leader of the extremist <a href="Vlaams%20Belang">Vlaams Belang</a> movement.

"<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" used one of Winston Smith's statements to argue that the rise in popularity of white nationalism and supremacy is due to the combination of the late-2000s recession and the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008">election of a black president</a>. Many such groups have been attempting to gain new recruits and increase their political influence by rebranding themselves as defenders of "white heritage" while de-emphasizing their dislike of minorities and Jews. Smith states, "[t]he emphasis is different now. We don't talk as much about what blacks have done to us; we're more focused on ourselves and our own culture."

In 2005, the staff of "The Political Cesspool" organized a rally at the Tennessee area known as Confederate Park, which, along with two other Confederacy-themed parks in downtown Memphis, has been the subject of a longtime controversy for honoring <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> soldiers and ideals. The park had been criticized earlier by a black <a href="Shelby%20County%2C%20Tennessee">Shelby County</a> official, which attracted the notice of New York-based activist <a href="Al%20Sharpton">Al Sharpton</a>, who was invited by the Reverend LaSimba Gray to hold a demonstration in Memphis. Sharpton planned a march called the Rally for Dignity from downtown Memphis to another park honoring Confederate Lieutenant General <a href="Nathan%20Bedford%20Forrest">Nathan Bedford Forrest</a> who was involved early in the organization of the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. Sharpton canceled the march after Edwards and "The Political Cesspool" staff obtained a permit to demonstrate in Confederate Park, located along Sharpton's planned march route.

Sharpton settled for a protest at Forrest Park. At the demonstration, he argued that "We need to show the rest of the world that the day for honoring people like this is over", and said in an interview that his objections were not related to race but to Forrest's Civil War-era (1861–1865) actions against the United States. Estimates of attendance at the rallies vary; according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, James Edwards attracted about 200 white counter-demonstrators to the Confederate Park vigil, while Sharpton's protest at Forrest Park attracted a few dozen black demonstrators, whom Edwards referred to as "rabble". The "Memphis Flyer" estimated that Sharpton attracted about 250 supporters. In the aftermath of the city park controversy, show affiliates Edwards, Farley, Bonds, and Rolen received the "Dixie Defender Award" from the <a href="Sons%20of%20Confederate%20Veterans">Sons of Confederate Veterans</a>.

Later that year, Memphis city councilman E. C. Jones awarded Edwards and Farley with a certificate "in appreciation of outstanding contributions to the community". Edwards and Farley also received an honorary city council membership from Jones, who had previously appeared on "The Political Cesspool". According to "<a href="The%20Commercial%20Appeal">The Commercial Appeal</a>", Jones had not listened to the show before the incident, and was unaware of its ideology. After a reporter informed him of the program's agenda, Jones initially refused to apologize. However, after another reporter confronted him with more details about the show's ideology, he changed his view, saying that he probably would not appear again. <a href="Carol%20Chumney">Carol Chumney</a>, another member of the <a href="Memphis%20City%20Council">Memphis City Council</a>, was also invited to appear on "The Political Cesspool", but ultimately declined the invitation after listening to an episode of the show; Chumney said, "what I heard was about advocating for prostitution ... So I told them I had other commitments."

In an interview with the French newspaper "<a href="Le%20Journal%20du%20Dimanche">Le Journal du Dimanche</a>", cohost Eddie "Bombardier" Miller described the United Nations as "<a href="Satan">Satan</a> on Earth".

In 2016, Edwards co-hosted a <a href="Super%20Tuesday">Super Tuesday</a> broadcast that interviewed <a href="Donald%20Trump%20Jr.">Donald Trump Jr.</a>, the son of Republican party presidential candidate <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>. Edwards praised the elder Trump and encouraged his supporters to vote for him.

As of 2011, "The Political Cesspool" airs on WLRM in Memphis, Tennessee, <a href="KHQN">KHQN</a> in <a href="Spanish%20Fork%2C%20Utah">Spanish Fork, Utah</a>; and the Florida-based <a href="Accent%20Radio%20Network">Accent Radio Network</a>. The Accent Radio Network and KHQN air a shortened two-hour version of the show, in contrast to the three-hour Liberty News Radio Network (WLRM) version.

ARN and Liberty News Radio Network broadcasts their feeds on separate channels on the <a href="Galaxy%2019">Galaxy 19</a> communications satellite.

Persona (series)

Persona, also known as Shin Megami Tensei: Persona, is a video game franchise developed and primarily published by <a href="Atlus">Atlus</a>. Focusing around a series of <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a>s, "Persona" is a spin-off from Atlus' "<a href="Megami%20Tensei">Megami Tensei</a>" franchise, and was originally based on the high school setting of "<a href="Shin%20Megami%20Tensei%20If...">Shin Megami Tensei If...</a>". The first entry in the series, "", was released in 1996. There have since been five further main games, with the most recent, "<a href="Persona%205">Persona 5</a>", being released in 2016. Numerous spin-offs have also been developed. The series takes its title from beings summoned by characters in battle, manifesting from their <a href="psychological%20persona">psychological persona</a>.

"Persona" began as a spin-off based on the positively-received setting of "If...". Its trademark features include a high school setting, a group of students as the protagonists, a silent protagonist similar to the mainline "Megami Tensei" franchise, and combat using Personas. Since the release of "<a href="Persona%203">Persona 3</a>" in 2006, the main series has used a <a href="Dating%20sim">social simulation</a> function called Social Links, which is directly linked to how Personas evolve. Central character designs are by series co-creator <a href="Kazuma%20Kaneko">Kazuma Kaneko</a> ("Persona" and the "Persona 2" duology) and <a href="Shigenori%20Soejima">Shigenori Soejima</a> ("Persona 3" onwards). Its overall theme is exploration of the human psyche and how the characters find their true selves. The series' recurring concepts and design elements draw on <a href="Analytical%20psychology">Jungian psychology</a> and <a href="Archetypal%20pedagogy">archetypes</a>, along with religion, mythology, and popular literature.

"Revelations: Persona" was the first role-playing "Megami Tensei" title to be released outside of Japan. Beginning with "", the English localizations began to remain faithful to the Japanese versions at the insistence of Atlus. The series is highly popular internationally, becoming the best-known "Megami Tensei" spin-off and establishing Atlus and the "Megami Tensei" franchise in North America. Following the release of "Persona 3" and "4", the series also established a strong following in Europe. The series has since gone on to sell a total of over nine million copies worldwide, outselling its parent franchise. There have been numerous adaptations, including <a href="anime">anime</a> television and theatrical series, <a href="novelization">novelization</a>s, <a href="manga">manga</a>s, <a href="Play%20%28theatre%29">stage plays</a>, <a href="radio%20drama">radio drama</a>s, and musical concerts.


"Persona 3" received a Japan-exclusive spin-off online game titled it follows a similar cycle of daytime activities and night time combat as the original game, with one player being chosen as the party leader each night. After its closure in 2008, a new <a href="free-to-play">free-to-play</a> browser game titled was released that year; the gameplay focused on players fusing Personas and confronting a threat known as the Qliphoth. Staying exclusive to Japan, it closed down in June 2010. A <a href="fighting%20game">fighting game</a> sequel to "Persona 4", "<a href="Persona%204%20Arena">Persona 4 Arena</a>", was released in <a href="Amusement%20arcade">arcade</a>s in Japan in 2012. Console versions were released in 2012 in Japan and North America, and 2013 in Europe. A sequel, "<a href="Persona%204%20Arena%20Ultimax">Persona 4 Arena Ultimax</a>", was similarly released in Japanese arcades in 2013, then released in 2014 in all regions for consoles. A standalone spin-off for the <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a>, "", was released worldwide in 2014; it features the full casts of "Persona 3" and "4", and is classed by Atlus as an official entry in the "Persona" canon. A sequel featuring the "Persona 5" cast is in production. A <a href="rhythm%20game">rhythm game</a> set after the events of "Persona 4 Arena Ultimax", "", was released worldwide in 2015. Two follow-ups to "Dancing All Night", "" and "", were simultaneously released in Japan in May 2018.

Several "Persona" mobile games have been made in partnership with other Japanese mobile companies such as Bbmf. Their first partnership was in 2006 with the development and release of a 3D <a href="dungeon%20crawl">dungeon crawl</a>er set within the environments of the first "Persona" game. The companies later collaborated on two mobile games based on the "Persona 2" games: in 2007, and in 2009. Both games carried over the basic gameplay functions of the original games tailored for mobile phones. Many mobile spin-offs are related to "Persona 3": there is an RPG side-story titled an <a href="action%20game">action game</a> prequel set ten years prior to "Persona 3" titled and an alternate version of "Persona 3" featuring different characters titled Multiple "Persona 3"-themed puzzle games have also been developed. An online mobile RPG set around the high school featured in "Persona 3", titled was released in 2009. "Persona 4" likewise received a mobile card game spin-off, titled 

The gameplay of the "Persona" series revolves around combat against various enemy types: Demons, Shadows and Personas. Main combat takes place during <a href="dungeon%20crawl">dungeon crawl</a>ing segments within various locations. The way battles initiate varies between <a href="random%20encounter">random encounter</a>s ("Persona", "Persona 2") or running into models representing enemy groups ("Persona 3" onwards). Battles are governed by a <a href="Turns%2C%20rounds%20and%20time-keeping%20systems%20in%20games%23Turn-based">turn-based system</a>, where the player party and enemies each attack the opposing side. Actions in battle include standard physical attacks using short-range melee or long-range projectile weapons, magical attacks, using items, guarding, and under certain conditions escaping from battles. During battle, either side can strike an enemy's weakness, which deals more damage than other attacks. Starting with "Persona 3", landing a critical hit grants the character an extra turn. If all enemies are knocked down by critical hits, the party can perform an "All Out Attack", with all party members attacking at once and dealing high damage. Each party member is manually controlled by the player in all but one "Persona" title: in "Persona 3", all the party apart from the main character are controlled by an AI-based command system. The general gameplay has remained consistent across all "Persona" games.

Each "Persona" game also includes unique elements. In "Persona", battles take place on a grid-based battlefield, with characters' and enemies' movements dictated by their placement on the battlefield. This system was abandoned for the "Persona 2" games: the party has free movement across the battlefield, and is assigned a set of moves which can be changed in the menu during and in between battles. In "Persona" and "Persona 3", there is a <a href="lunar%20phase">lunar phase</a> tied to gameplay, time progression, and the plot. In "Persona 4", this was changed to a weather-based system, where changes in the weather keyed to the story affected enemy behavior. "Persona 5" introduces elements such as <a href="Platform%20game">platforming</a> and <a href="Stealth%20game">stealth</a> gameplay to dungeon exploration. The All-Out Attack can be initiated in a "Hold-Up" session, triggered when all enemies are knocked down.

A defining aspect of the series is the Personas, manifestations of a person's psyche. Many Personas used up to "Persona 3" are inspired by <a href="Classical%20mythology">Graeco-Roman mythology</a>. In "Persona 4" they are based on <a href="Japanese%20mythology">Japanese deities</a>; "Persona 5" uses characters inspired by popular fictional and historical outlaws. The summoning ritual for Personas in battle varies throughout the series: in early games, the party gains the ability to summon through a short ritual after playing a parlor game; in "Persona 3", they fire a gun-like device called an Evoker at their head; in "Persona 4", they summon their Personas using <a href="Tarot">Tarot cards</a>; in "Persona 5", they are summoned through the characters' masks.

Personas are used for types of physical attack and magical attacks, along with actions such as healing and curing or inflicting <a href="status%20effect">status effect</a>s. For all "Persona" games, all playable characters start out with an initial Persona, which can evolve into other Personas through story-based events and use during battle. In multiple "Persona" games, two or more Personas can be summoned at once to perform a powerful Fusion Spell. In "Persona 3", "4" and "5", only the main character can wield and change between multiple Personas; the other characters use a single Persona. During the course of the game, the player acquires more Personas through a system of Skill Cards, represented by <a href="Major%20Arcana">Major Arcana</a> Tarot cards. Each skill card represents a different Persona family, which in turn hold their own abilities inherent to that family. Multiple Personas can be fused together to create a new Persona with improved and inherited abilities: these range from fusing two Personas in the "Persona 2" duology, to fusing up to twelve in "Persona 4". Starting with "Persona 3", the main protagonist of each game has an ability known as "Wild Card", an ability to summon multiple Personas represented by the Fool Arcana.

"Social Links" is a system introduced in "Persona 3" that is a form of character interaction tied to the growth of Personas. During their time outside battle, the main character can interact with and grow a particular Social Link, which acts as an independent character growth system tied to a Persona family or Arcanum. As the main character's relationship with the character representing a Social Link grows, its rank is raised and more powerful Personas related to the Social Link's assigned Arcanum can be summoned and fused. Attributes related to the main character's social life can also be used to improve their Persona abilities, such as their academic abilities and social aptitude. An enhanced version of the Social Link system, known as "Confidants", appeared in "Persona 5".

In "Persona", the "Persona 2" duology, and "Persona 5", there is also a "Negotiation" mechanic carried over from the "Megami Tensei" series, in which player characters can talk with enemies and provoke certain actions depending on their dialogue choices. Some responses yield Skill Cards for use in creating new Personas. Negotiation was removed from "Persona 3" and "Persona 4", although Atlus staff considered the Social Link system and aspects of Persona Fusion to be a "disguised" version of it. In "Persona 5", they can be initiated during a "Hold Up" session; Shadows can be persuaded to join the party as a new Persona if the Negotiation is successful, the player character has room in their roster and is at an appropriate experience level.

The "Persona" series takes place in modern-day <a href="Japan">Japan</a> and focuses on a group of high school students, with the exception to this being "Eternal Punishment", which focused on a group of adults. The setting has been described as <a href="urban%20fantasy">urban fantasy</a>, with extraordinary events happening in otherwise normal locations. The typical setting used is a city, with a noted exception being the rural town setting of "Persona 4". Although they are typically stand-alone games that only share thematic elements, the "Persona" games share a continuity, with elements from previous games turning up in later ones. "Persona" and the "Persona 2" games shared narrative elements which were concluded with "Eternal Punishment", so "Persona 3" started out with a fresh setting and characters. The first in the series is "Persona", set in the year 1996. This is followed by the events of "Innocent Sin" and "Eternal Punishment" in 1999. At the end of "Innocent Sin", the main characters rewrite events to avert the destruction of Earth, creating the "Eternal Punishment" reality, with the original reality becoming an isolated Other Side. "Persona 3" and subsequent games stem from "Eternal Punishment". "Persona 3" is set from 2009 to 2010, and "Persona 4" is set from 2011 to 2012. The "Persona 4 Arena" games and "Dancing All Night" take place in the months following "Persona 4". "Persona Q" takes place in a separate enclosed world in which the characters of "Persona 3" and "4" are drawn into from their respective time periods. In contrast, "Persona 5" is set in a non-specific year referred to as "20XX".

A central concept for the series is the <a href="collective%20unconscious">collective unconscious</a>, a place generated by the hearts of humanity and from which Personas are born. According to the official "Persona Club P3" book, the collective unconscious was generated by the primitive life on Earth as a means of containing the spiritual essence of Nyx, a space-born being whose presence would cause the death of all life on Earth. Her body was damaged by the impact and became the moon, while her psyche was left on the surface and locked away at the heart of the collective unconscious. The fragments of Nyx's psyche, known as "Shadows", are both a threat and a crucial part of humanity's existence. To further help defend against hostile Shadows, people generated the deities that exist within the collective unconscious, many of which manifest as Personas. Nyx appears in "Persona 3" as the antagonist. The major dungeon locations in each game, such as Tartarus in "Persona 3" and Palaces in "Persona 5", are generated by the latent wishes and desires of humans, and are generally used by another force for their own ends. A recurring location appearing in most of the games is the "Velvet Room", a place between reality and unconsciousness created by Philemon that changes form depending on the psyche of its current guest. Its inhabitants, led by an enigmatic old man called Igor, aid the main characters by helping them hone their Persona abilities. While normally inaccessible and invisible to all except those who forged a contract with the room, others can be summoned alongside the guest, intentionally or otherwise.

The main character of each "Persona" game is a <a href="silent%20protagonist">silent protagonist</a> representing the player, with a manner described by the series' director as "silent and cool". When the writer for new story content in "Eternal Punishment"s PSP version wished for the main character to have spoken dialogue, this was vetoed as it went against the series tradition. Two recurring characters generated by the collective unconscious are Philemon and Nyarlathotep, the respective representatives of the positive and negative traits of humanity. In "Innocent Sin", the two reveal that they are engaged in a proxy contest as to whether humanity can embrace its contradictory feelings and find a higher purpose before destroying itself. Philemon makes appearances in later "Persona" games as a blue butterfly. Many of the major antagonists in the series are personifications of death generated by the human subconscious. The central theme of the "Persona" series is exploration of the human psyche and the main characters discovering their true selves. The stories generally focus on the main cast's interpersonal relationships and psychologies. There is also an underlying focus on "the human soul".

Many of the concepts and characters within the series (<a href="Persona%20%28psychology%29">Personas</a>, <a href="Shadow%20%28psychology%29">Shadows</a>, Philemon) use <a href="Jungian%20psychology">Jungian psychology</a> and <a href="Jungian%20archetypes">archetypes</a>. A recurring motif are the "masks" people wear during everyday life, which ties back to their Personas. This motif was more overtly expressed in "Persona 5" through the main casts' use of masks in their thief guises. The dual lives of the main casts are directly inspired by these themes. Each game also includes specific themes and motifs. "Persona 2" focuses on the effect of rumors on the fabric of reality (referred to by the developers as "the power of <a href="Kotodama">Kotodama</a>"); "Persona 3" employs themes involving depression and the darkness within people; "Persona 4" focuses on how gossip and the media influences people's views of others; and "Persona 5" shows how the main characters pursue personal freedom in a restrictive modern society. A recurring element in the earlier entries is "<a href="Zhuangzi%20%28book%29%23The%20Butterfly%20Dream">The Butterfly Dream</a>", a famous story by the Chinese philosopher <a href="Zhuang%20Zhou">Zhuang Zhou</a>. It ties in with the series' themes, and also with Philemon's frequent appearances as a butterfly. Philemon's original appearance was based on Zhuang Zhou. The character <a href="Nyarlathotep">Nyarlathotep</a> is based on the character of the same name from <a href="H.%20P.%20Lovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>'s <a href="Cthulhu%20Mythos">Cthulhu Mythos</a>, and the Mythos as a whole is frequently referenced in "Persona 2". The Velvet Room was based on the <a href="Black%20and%20White%20Lodges">Black Lodge</a> from "<a href="Twin%20Peaks">Twin Peaks</a>". Igor and the other assistants of the Velvet Room are all named after characters from the novel "<a href="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>" by <a href="Mary%20Shelley">Mary Shelley</a>.

The "Persona" series was first conceived after the release of "<a href="Shin%20Megami%20Tensei%20If...">Shin Megami Tensei If...</a>" for the <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Famicom</a>. As the high school setting of "If..." had been positively received, Atlus decided to create a dedicated subseries focusing on the inner struggles of young adults. The focus on high school life was also decided upon due to the experiences of the series' creators, <a href="Kouji%20Okada">Kouji Okada</a> and <a href="Kazuma%20Kaneko">Kazuma Kaneko</a>: according to them, as nearly everyone experiences being a student at some point in their lives, it was something everyone could relate to, representing a time of both learning and personal freedom. In their view, this approach helped players accept the series' themes and the variety of ideas included in each title. Kaneko in particular tried to recreate his experiences and the impact it had on him during his time with the series. The main concept behind the first game was a "<a href="Megami%20Tensei">Megami Tensei</a>" title that was more approachable for new and casual players than the main series. The abundance of casual games on the PlayStation reinforced this decision. The game's title, represented the game's status as a direct spin-off from the series. It was later dropped to further define "Persona" as a standalone series. After the success of "Persona", "Innocent Sin" began development, retaining many of the original staff. During the writing of "Innocent Sin", it was decided that the world of "Persona 2" needed a different perspective than that of the current protagonist. This decision laid the groundwork for "Eternal Punishment". Following this, the "Persona" series entered a hiatus while focus turned to other projects, including "".

The conceptual "Persona 3" was submitted to Atlus in 2003 by <a href="Katsura%20Hashino">Katsura Hashino</a>, who had worked as a designer for multiple "Megami Tensei" games and had been the director for "Nocturne". Gaining Atlus' approval of the concept, development started in the same year, after the completion of "Nocturne" and the "<a href="Digital%20Devil%20Saga">Digital Devil Saga</a>" duology. "Persona 3" was part of Atlus' push to expand their player base outside of Japan. Ideas were being passed around about "Persona 4", but the game did not begin official development until after the release of "Persona 3". Preparations for "Persona 5"s development began in 2010. The team decided to shift towards more challenging story themes, saying that the shift would be more drastic than that experienced with "Persona 3". "Persona 4 Arena" and its sequel were the first non-RPG collaborative project in the series: its success inspired the creation of both "Persona Q" and "Dancing All Night".

The first three "Persona" games were developed by Atlus' internal R&D1 studio, the studio responsible for the mainline "Megami Tensei" games. Beginning with "Persona 3", a dedicated team originally referred to as the 2nd Creative Production Department began handling development for the series. The team was later renamed P-Studio in 2012. Hashino remained in charge of the studio until the Japanese release of "Persona 5" in 2016, when he moved to found a new department, Studio Zero, and work on a new project. Aside from Atlus, other developers have helped develop entries in the "Persona" series. During the pre-production stage of "Persona 4 Arena", Hashino approached <a href="Arc%20System%20Works">Arc System Works</a> after being impressed by their work on the "<a href="BlazBlue">BlazBlue</a>" series. For "Dancing All Night", development was initially handled by <a href="Dingo%20Inc.">Dingo</a>, but were later dropped from the project entirely due to quality concerns, with Atlus taking over full development of the game.

The two character artists for the "Persona" series are <a href="Kazuma%20Kaneko">Kazuma Kaneko</a>, a central artist in the main "Megami Tensei" series who designed characters for the first three "Persona" games, and <a href="Shigenori%20Soejima">Shigenori Soejima</a>, who worked in a secondary capacity alongside Kaneko and took Kaneko's place as the character designer from "Persona 3" onwards. While designing the characters for "Persona", Kaneko was inspired by multiple notable celebrities and fictional characters of the time, along with members of Atlus staff. In "Persona" and "Innocent Sin", the main characters all wore the same school uniforms, so Kaneko differentiated them using accessories. For "Eternal Punishment", the main cast were adults, so Kaneko needed to rethink his design procedure. Eventually, he adopted the concept of ordinary adults, and gave them designs that would stand out in-game.

Soejima's first major work for the series was working on side characters for "Persona 2" alongside Kaneko. Kaneko put Soejima in charge of the series' art direction after "Persona 2" as Kaneko did not want to imprint his drawing style on the "Persona" series, and also wanted Soejima to gain experience. Soejima felt a degree of pressure when he was given his new role, as the series had accumulated a substantial following during Kaneko's tenure. In a later interview, Soejima said that although he respected and admired Kaneko, he never consciously imitated the latter's work, and eventually settled into the role of pleasing the fans of the "Persona" series, approaching character designs with the idea of creating something new rather than referring back to Kaneko's work. For his character designs, Soejima uses real people he has met or seen, looking at what their appearance says about their personality. If his designs come too close to the people he has seen, he does a rough sketch while keeping the personality of the person in mind. For his work on "Persona Q", his first time working with a <a href="Super%20deformed">deformed Chibi</a> style due to its links with the "<a href="Etrian%20Odyssey%20%28series%29">Etrian Odyssey</a>" series, Soejima took into account what fans felt about the characters. A crucial part of his design technique was looking at what made a character stand out, then adjusting those features so they remained recognizable even with the redesign.

Starting with "Persona 3", each "Persona" game has been defined by a different aesthetic and key color. It is one of the first artistic decisions made by the team: "Persona 3" has a dark atmosphere and serious characters, so the primary color was chosen as blue to reflect these and the urban setting. In contrast, "Persona 4" has a lighter tone and characters but also sports a murder-mystery plot, so the color yellow was chosen to represent both the lighter tones and to evoke a "warning" signal. According to Soejima, blue was the "color of adolescence", and yellow was the "color of happiness". For "Persona 5", the color chosen was red, to convey a harsh feeling in contrast to the previous "Persona" games and tie in with the game's story themes. Its art style was described as a natural evolution from where "Persona 4" left off.

The music of the "Persona" series has been handled by multiple composers. The one most associated with the series is <a href="Shoji%20Meguro">Shoji Meguro</a>, who began working on "Persona" shortly after he joined Atlus in 1995. His very first composition for the game was "Aria of the Soul", the theme for the velvet room that became a recurring track throughout the series. During his initial work on the series, Meguro felt restricted by the limited storage space of the PlayStation's disc system, and so when he began composing for "Persona 3", which allowed for <a href="Streaming%20audio%20in%20video%20games">sound streaming</a> due to increased hardware capacity, he was able to fully express his musical style. His main worry for his music in "Persona 3" and "4" was the singers' pronunciation of the English lyrics. He was unable to work on the "Persona 2" games as he was tied up with other projects, including "<a href="Maken%20X">Maken X</a>". Meguro also served as the lead composer in "Persona 5", using elements of <a href="acid%20jazz">acid jazz</a> and the game's themes for inspiration to achieve the right mood. The music for "Innocent Sin" and "Eternal Punishment" was handled by Toshiko Tasaki, Kenichi Tsuchiya, and Masaki Kurokawa. Tsuchiya had originally done minor work on "Persona", and found composing for the games a strenuous experience. Spin-offs, such as the "Persona Q" and "Dancing" subseries, are usually handled by other Atlus composers such as Atsushi Kitajoh, Toshiki Konishi, and Ryota Kozuka.

The series consists of thirteen games, not counting re-releases and mobile games. "Persona" was the first role-playing entry in the "Megami Tensei" franchise to be released outside of Japan, as previous entries had been considered ineligible due to possibly controversial content. As examples of this content were in a milder form for "Persona", the restrictions did not apply. According to Atlus, "Persona" and its sequel were to test player reactions to the "Megami Tensei" series outside of Japan. The greater majority of "Persona" games were either first released on or exclusive to PlayStation platforms. This trend was broken with the release of "Persona Q" for the 3DS in 2014. All the "Persona" games have been published by Atlus in Japan and North America. An exception in Japan was the Windows port of "Persona", which was published by <a href="ASCII%20Corporation">ASCII Corporation</a>. After 2016, due to Atlus USA's merger with Sega of America, <a href="Sega">Sega</a> took over North American publishing duties, although the Atlus brand remained intact.

Due to the company not having a European branch, Atlus has generally given publishing duties to other third-party publishers with branches in Europe. This frequently results in a gap between North American and European release dates ranging from a few months to a year or more. For "Persona 3", Atlus gave publishing duties to <a href="Koei">Koei</a>. For "Persona 4", European publishing was handled by <a href="Square%20Enix">Square Enix</a>. "Persona 4 Arena" was originally published in Europe by Zen United after a long delay, but the digital rights were eventually returned to Atlus, resulting in the game being removed from PSN. Atlus ended up re-publishing the digital PlayStation version in Europe. They had previously digitally published the PSP port of "Persona" in Europe and Australia. "Arena Ultimax" was published in Europe by Sega, who had recently purchased Atlus' parent company. It was speculated that this could lead to a new trend that would shorten the release gap between North America and Europe. A regular publishing partner was <a href="Ghostlight">Ghostlight</a>, whose relations with Atlus went back to the European release of "Nocturne". A more recent partner was <a href="Nippon%20Ichi%20Software">NIS America</a>, which published "Persona 4 Golden", "Persona Q", and "Dancing All Night". Atlus' partnership with NIS America ended in 2016, with NIS America citing difficulties with the company since its acquisition by Sega as reasons for the split. As part of their statement, NIS America said that Atlus had become "very picky" about European partners, selecting those which could offer the highest minimal sales guarantee on their products. Sega of America and Atlus USA eventually entered into a partnership with European publishing company <a href="Deep%20Silver">Deep Silver</a> to publish multiple games in the region, including "Persona 5".

The localizations for the "Persona" series are generally handled by translator Yu Namba of <a href="Atlus%20USA">Atlus USA</a>, who also handles localization for multiple other "Megami Tensei" games. Another prominent staff member was Nich Maragos, who worked with Namba on multiple "Persona" games until moving to <a href="Nintendo%20of%20America">Nintendo of America</a> prior to 2015. The localization of "Persona" was handled by a small team, which put a lot of pressure on them as they needed to adjust the game for Western audiences: the changes implemented included altering names, changing the appearance of characters, and removing numerous cultural references. An entire alternate main quest was also removed. After "Persona", it was decided that future "Persona" games should be as faithful as possible to their original releases. Namba's first localization project for the series was "Eternal Punishment". For the release of "Innocent Sin", there was a debate over whether to release it, as it contained potentially controversial content including allusions to <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a>. In the end, due to staff and resource shortages, "Innocent Sin" was passed over for localization in favor of its sequel "Eternal Punishment". Later, when the company developed the PSP ports, the team released the ports of "Persona" and "Innocent Sin" overseas so fans attracted by "Persona 3" and "4" would be able to easily catch up with the rest of the series. The localization for "Persona" was completely redone, reverting all the previous altered content and restoring all previously cut content. The port of "Eternal Punishment" was not localized due to "unusual circumstances", so the company released the original version on PSN instead.

For the localizations of "Persona 3" and "4", the team incorporated as much of the original content as possible, such as using Japanese honorifics and keeping the game's currency as <a href="Japanese%20yen">yen</a> rather than changing it. As a general rule, they incorporate cultural elements from the original versions unless they would not be understood by the player, such as with certain jokes. Nevertheless, some changes had to be made. In one instance, the character Mitsuru Kirijo was originally an English speaker, but her second language for the localized version was changed to French due to her cultured appearance. School tests also needed to be changed due to similar language-based issues. The Social Links were originally called but this was changed as the word "Community" had a very specific meaning in English. The new name was inspired by the way the character Igor made reference to the concept using words such as "society" and "bonds". Some in-game <a href="Easter%20egg%20%28media%29">Easter egg</a> references were also changed: in "Persona 3" references to "<a href="Shin%20Megami%20Tensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a>" by a character in an in-game <a href="Massively%20multiplayer%20online%20role-playing%20game">MMORPG</a> were changed to reference earlier "Persona" games, while mentions of a fictional detective in "Persona 4" were altered to reference the Kuzunoha family from "Eternal Punishment" and the "Devil Summoner" series. Character names have also needed adjustment, such as the stage name of "Persona 4" character Rise Kujikawa, and the way characters referred to each other was adjusted to appeal more to a western audience. "Persona 5" was also localized in this fashion.

The localized English names of games have also been altered. The banner title for "Persona" was changed from "Megami Ibunroku" to "Revelations", principally because the team thought the latter name sounded "cool". The "Revelations" title was removed for "Innocent Sin" and "Eternal Punishment". After the successful release of "Nocturne", the ""Shin Megami Tensei"" moniker was added to the series title to help with Western marketing. This has not been the case for some games: "Persona 4 Arena" original title, "Persona 4: The Ultimate in Mayonaka Arena", was shortened as it sounded "awkward", and the ""Shin Megami Tensei"" moniker was dropped as it would have made the title too long, which has been applied to every game in the series since. The same change was made for "Persona 4 Golden", with the team also dropping ""The"" that was in the Japanese title because it would have sounded "odd" in English-speaking regions.

By October 2018, the series had sold about 9.3 million copies worldwide. The first "Persona" was referred to at the time as a <a href="sleeper%20hit">sleeper hit</a>, and the success of it and "Eternal Punishment" helped establish both Atlus and "Megami Tensei" in North America. In Europe, the series did not become established prior to the release of "Persona 3" and "4", both of which were highly successful in the region. According to Atlus CEO Naoto Hiraoka, the main turning point for the franchise was the release of "Persona 3", which was a commercial success and brought the series to the attention of the mainstream gaming community. "Persona 4" received an even better reception. The "Persona" series' success has allowed Atlus to build a strong player base outside of Japan, contributing to the success of other games such as "<a href="Catherine%20%28video%20game%29">Catherine</a>".

The "Persona" series has been referred to as the most popular spin-off from the "Megami Tensei" franchise, gaining notoriety and success in its own right. <a href="Io9">Io9</a>'s James Whitbrook commented that while "here in the west, we've got plenty of awesome urban fantasy, especially from a YA perspective. But what makes Persona interesting is that it's the familiar concept of Urban fantasy, the balance of the mundane "normal" life of the protagonists and the problems they have there with the fantastical nature of the supernatural world that lies beneath all that, from a Japanese perspective. Over here, that's much less common, and the way the series portrays urban fantasy through that lens is what makes it so different, especially from what you would normally expect from Japanese RPGs.". "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>", in an article concerning the "Megami Tensei" series, cited the "Persona" series' "modern-day horror stories" and "teams of Japanese high-school kids" as the perfect example of the franchise. "Persona" was mentioned in 1999 by <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Andrew Vestal as a game that deserved attention despite not aging well, saying "Examining "Persona" reveals three of the traits that make the series so popular - and unique - amongst RPG fans: demonology, negotiation, and psychology". The game has been named as a cult classic. "Persona 3" was named by RPGamer as the greatest RPG of the past decade in 2009, and RPGFan listed "Persona 3" and "4" in second and fourth place respectively in their similar 2011 list. "Persona 3" was listed by <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a> as one of the 20 essential RPGs for players of the genre. "Persona 4" was also listed by "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>" as one of the greatest games of all time in a 2010 list.

As well as gaining critical acclaim, the series has been the subject of controversy over its content. This controversy began with the localized banner title of the original "Persona", which raised concerns due to its religious implications. Kurt Katala, writing for <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> in 2006 about the controversial content of the "Megami Tensei" franchise as a whole, mentioned "Innocent Sin"s references to homosexuality, schoolyard violence, and Nazism, considering them possible reasons why the game was not originally released outside of Japan. In 1UP.com's 2007 game awards, which ran in the March 2008 issue of "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>", "Persona 3" was given the "Most controversial game that created no controversy" award: the writers said "<a href="Rockstar%20Games">Rockstar</a>'s <a href="Hot%20Coffee%20mod">Hot Coffee sex scandal</a> and "<a href="Bully%20%28video%20game%29">Bully</a>"s boy-on-boy kissing's got nothing on this PS2 role-player's suicide-initiated battles or subplot involving student-teacher dating". "Persona 4" has in turn been examined by multiple sites over its portrayal of character sexuality and gender identity.
The first <a href="anime">anime</a> adaptation of the "Persona" series, a television series titled "", aired in 2008. It was animated by <a href="A-1%20Pictures">A-1 Pictures</a>, directed by Jun Matsumoto, written by a team that included Yasuyuki Muto, Shogo Yasukawa, and Shinsuke Onishi, and composed for by <a href="Taku%20Iwasaki">Taku Iwasaki</a>. Its characters were designed by Soejima and Yuriko Ishii, while Persona designs were done by Nobuhiko Genma. It was distributed internationally by <a href="NIS%20America">NIS America</a>. "Trinity Soul" takes place in an alternate setting ten years after "Persona 3", making it a non-canon entry in the franchise. An anime adaptation of the original "Persona 4", "", aired in 2011. The 25-episode series was produced by <a href="Anime%20International%20Company">AIC ASTA</a> and directed by Seiji Kishi. In 2014, a series based on "Persona 4 Golden", titled "Persona 4: The Golden Animation", was produced by A-1 Pictures. This series, which retains the cast of the original adaptation, dramatizes the new material included in "Persona 4 Golden", focusing on the protagonist's encounters with new character Marie. A standalone prequel anime created by A-1 Pictures, "Persona 5 The Animation: The Day Breakers", was released in September 2016 prior to the Japanese release of the game. A full anime series based on "Persona 5", "", aired in 2018.

The original "Persona 4" anime series was made into a condensed film adaptation titled "Persona 4: The Animation - The Factor of Hope"; it was released in Japanese cinemas in 2012. "Persona 3" has also been adapted into a series of anime films produced by AIC ASTA and featuring staff from "Persona 4: The Animation", released in cinemas in Japan and licensed for release overseas by <a href="Aniplex">Aniplex</a>. The four films are titled "", "", "", and "". They were released from 2013–2016. For both "Persona 4: The Animation" and the "Persona 3" film series, one of the main concerns was the portrayal of the lead characters, which were originally dictated by player actions.

"Persona" was adapted into an eight-issue manga series titled "Megami Ibunroku Persona", originally serialized in 1996 and later reissued in 2009. A second spin-off manga, was released to tie in with the release of the "Persona 2" games. Set within the same setting of the "Persona 2" games, it follows a separate story. In its 2011 reissue, new material was added that connected the manga to the events of "Innocent Sin". "Persona 3", "Persona 4", and "Persona 5" have all received their own manga adaptations. Another manga based on "Persona Q" was also serialized: two separate manga storylines, based on the two storylines featured in the game, were written and dubbed "Side:P3" and "Side:P4". Multiple novels based on "Persona 3" and "4" have also been released.

Three <a href="Play%20%28theatre%29">stage plays</a> based on "Persona 3" have been produced under the banner "Persona 3 the Weird Masquerade". They received limited runs and featured separate performances for the male and female versions of the game's protagonists. The three plays are titled "Ao no Kakusei", "Gunjō no Meikyū", and "Sōen Kesshō". "Persona 4" was also adapted into two stage plays, both produced by <a href="Marvelous%20%28company%29">Marvelous AQL</a> and receiving limited runs in 2012: "Visualive" and "Visualive the Evolution". A stage play based on "Persona 4 Arena" was likewise given a limited run in December 2014, and one based on "Persona 4 Arena Ultimax" ran in July 2016.

Atlus has created or hosted media dedicated to the "Persona" series. A dedicated magazine originally ran for ten issues between 2011 and 2012, and has been irregularly revived since then. An official talk show released on the official "Persona" website and <a href="Niconico">Niconico</a>, "Persona Stalkers Club", began in February 2014. Hosted by freelance writer Mafia Kajita and actress <a href="Tomomi%20Isomura">Tomomi Isomura</a>, it was designed to deepen the connection between Atlus and the "Persona" fanbase. Concerts featuring music from the "Persona" series have also been performed, and some have received commercial releases on home media in Japan. Action figures and merchandise such as clothing related to "Persona 3" and "4" have also been produced.

Carrington Moss

Carrington Moss is a large area of <a href="bog">peat bog</a> near <a href="Carrington%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Carrington</a> in <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>, England. It lies south of the <a href="River%20Mersey">River Mersey</a>, approximately south-west of <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, and occupies an area of about . The depth of peat varies between .

Originally an unused area of grouse <a href="moorland">moorland</a>, the moss was <a href="Land%20reclamation">reclaimed</a> in the latter half of the 19th century for <a href="farming">farming</a> and the disposal of Manchester's waste. A system of tramways was built to connect it with the <a href="Manchester%20Ship%20Canal">Manchester Ship Canal</a> and a nearby railway line. During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> the land was used as a <a href="Starfish%20site">Starfish site</a> and in the latter half of the 20th century, a large industrial complex was built along its northern edge. More recently, several sporting facilities have been built on Carrington Moss.

Today, the land is still used for farming and several <a href="nature%20reserves">nature reserves</a> have been established within its bounds. Parts of Carrington Moss are accessible to the public over several <a href="Rights%20of%20way%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">rights of way</a>.

"A History of Flixton, Urmston, and Davyhulme" (1898) claims that the name Carrington might be derived from the <a href="Goidelic%20languages">Goidelic Celtic</a> root "Cathair", a fortress, but a more recent theory is that it derives from an Anglicised form of a <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n personal name. A Carrington Hall, seat of the Carrington family (descended from William de Caryngton) once existed to the north of Carrington Moss, at the junction formed by the modern-day A6144 and B5158 roads. The word moss, first used during the 15th century, forms part of the local name for a lowland peat bog, "mosslands". Today the term is also used to describe former bogs that have been converted to farmland.

Manchester's population increased by more than 150% between 1831 and 1851. This placed considerable pressure on the city's ability to dispose of refuse, exacerbated during the 1870s by a gradual switch from the older <a href="cesspit">cesspit</a> methods of sewage disposal to <a href="pail%20closet">pail closet</a>s. These needed to be emptied regularly and by the 1880s, <a href="night%20soil">night soil</a> accounted for about 75% of Manchester's of refuse.

Along with parts of <a href="Moss%20Side">Moss Side</a> and <a href="Withington">Withington</a>, in 1885 <a href="Bradford%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bradford</a>, <a href="Harpurhey">Harpurhey</a> and <a href="Rusholme">Rusholme</a> became part of the City of Manchester. To cope with the extra demands placed on the area's refuse disposal systems, <a href="Manchester%20Corporation">Manchester Corporation</a> began to look for disposal sites. A number of locations were considered, including one on <a href="Deeside">Deeside</a> and another in <a href="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a>, but Carrington Moss was chosen due to the nature of its land and its accessibility. Therefore, in 1886, the corporation bought the Carrington Moss Estate—an area of <a href="grouse">grouse</a> moorland—from <a href="Harry%20Grey%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Stamford">Harry Grey, 8th Earl of Stamford</a>.
The purchase was part of the corporation's ultimately unsuccessful plan to retain the <a href="pail%20closet">pail closet</a> system (now superseded by the <a href="water%20closet">water closet</a>), and followed a public scandal created by the daily dumping of 30–60 tons of <a href="human%20feces">human faeces</a> into the <a href="River%20Medlock">Medlock</a> and <a href="River%20Irwell">Irwell</a> rivers, at Holt Town sewage works. It paid about £38,000 (£ as of 2019), for the site, but the bog's depth, between deep pushed the total development cost to almost £94,000 (£ as of 2019). The estate included of wild mossland, of partly cultivated mossland, of mossland under cultivation and of incomplete roads. A number of brick buildings were included, along with Asphodel Farm and Ash Farm, both with wooden farmhouses. The corporation rented of land in small holdings to local farmers and kept for itself.

The bog's virgin moss was cultivated and drainage channels cut through at regular intervals, the first step in the area's reclamation. This drainage caused the characteristically convex Moss to sag noticeably; some residents of <a href="Dunham%20Town">Dunham Town</a> commented that they could see parts of <a href="Carrington%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Carrington</a> previously obscured by the moss. A network of <a href="Tramway%20%28industrial%29">tramways</a> and roads was constructed using <a href="clinker%20%28waste%29">clinker</a> and other materials brought from the city. Drains were laid and the land cleared of scrub. A water supply was also installed. Some of the more dangerous buildings were demolished, while others were either repaired or replaced.

Refuse was loaded from a number of locations and was first transported along the <a href="Mersey%20and%20Irwell%20Navigation">Mersey and Irwell Navigation</a>, until that waterway was closed on 11 November 1888. For several years until the completion of its replacement, the <a href="Manchester%20Ship%20Canal">Manchester Ship Canal</a>, the corporation was reliant on Manchester's local railway network. Refuse was loaded at the corporation's Water Street Depot on to Cornbrook sidings and in waggons to Carrington on a junction from the <a href="Cheshire%20Lines%20Committee">Cheshire Lines Committee</a>'s (CLC) <a href="Glazebrook%20railway%20station">Glazebrook</a> to <a href="Stockport%20Tiviot%20Dale%20railway%20station">Stockport Tiviot Dale</a> line. The canal company installed a temporary dock on the new canal, although this was considered impractical and was rarely used. A more permanent arrangement was made several years later. New railway sidings were also built; once complete, refuse was loaded from near <a href="Oldham%20Road%20railway%20station">Oldham Road railway station</a> and the corporation's Water Street Depot. It was then transported along the Ship Canal to a newly built wharf, and thereafter, by tramway across the moss.
Once delivered, refuse was normally placed in heaps and allowed to dry before being put into the ground. The naturally <a href="Humic%20acid">acidic</a> water was a perfect receptacle for the contents of pail closets, rich in <a href="urea">urea</a> and <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>. Bacteria quickly broke the refuse down into <a href="ammonium">ammonium</a> compounds and free ammonia, which neutralised the soil's acidity and created <a href="ammonium%20nitrate">ammonium nitrate</a>—an essential fertiliser for <a href="arable%20land">arable land</a>.

By the 1890s, over 70,000 long tons of excrement annually were being disposed of on the moss. The land was a useful source of income for Manchester; for the year ending 31 March 1900 the estate made a profit of £777 5<a href="Shilling">s</a> 2<a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">d</a> (by comparison, the larger Chat Moss made £2,591 13s 4d). Its success helped persuade Manchester Corporation to purchase 2,583 acres of nearby <a href="Chat%20Moss">Chat Moss</a> in 1895. By 1897, 37,082 long tons of nightsoil, 587 long tons of sweepings and litter and 11,673 long tons of cinders were being sent to Carrington. Various crops were grown on the land, including wheat, oats, potatoes and carrots. A variety of ornamental shrubs, including <a href="rhododendron">rhododendron</a>s, were grown in a nursery and used in the parks and gardens of Manchester.

By the 1930s, extensive use of the water closet meant that the amount of night soil being delivered to Carrington Moss had dropped significantly. During this period, the majority of refuse placed on the Moss came from ash bins, although some was from <a href="slaughterhouse">slaughterhouse</a>s and lairage facilities. In 1923, manure of only moderate value was being delivered, supplemented by sulphate of potash, sulphate of ammonia, and super-phosphates. Altrincham Sewage Farm (visible on the above map) was used to flood the surrounding fields with sewage water. To the west, a series of disused marl-pits formed <a href="Timperley">Timperley</a> Sewage Beds, a further source of manure.
Carrington Wharf had fallen out of use by 1934 and with the advent of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, five miles (8 km) of railway were lifted and all the waggons scrapped. At the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Supply">Ministry of Supply</a>'s request, much of the infrastructure supporting both Carrington Moss and Chat Moss was sold. The sidings at Carrington continued to be used by the CLC for waggon storage, but Carrington Wharf was subsumed in 1946 by the construction of <a href="Carrington%20Power%20Station">Carrington Power Station</a>. During the war, the moss became one of four sites in Manchester used as a <a href="Starfish%20site">Starfish site</a>—decoy targets for enemy aircraft. Operational control was the responsibility of <a href="RAF%20Balloon%20Command">RAF Balloon Command</a>. The site contained an <a href="air%20raid%20shelter">air raid shelter</a> for the operational crew and several combustible devices used to simulate fires and lights. The site was activated in December 1940 but closed several years later, following a reduction in enemy aircraft attacks and lack of manpower.

In 1948, the estate was valued at £82,615. In the year ending March 1971, it produced an income of £20,268. By that time the entire Moss had been fully reclaimed; of cultivated land, of roads and plantations, and of 'industrial area' were available for use. The principal land uses were <a href="dairy">dairy</a>, arable farming, and glasshouse culture. No refuse was delivered for the year ending March 1971, and the Moss had by that time taken a total of 1,305,822 tons of refuse.

Industrialisation of the moss took place from 1947–1952 when Petro-Carbon ltd began to build what would later become known as the Shell Site. The estate was leased on 1 October 1968 to <a href="Shell%20Chemicals">Shell Chemicals</a>, who in 1957 had purchased a <a href="propylene%20oxide">propylene oxide</a> plant along the moss's northern edge. Shell had built an <a href="ethylene%20oxide">ethylene oxide</a> plant in 1958 and began to produce polyether polyols the following year. Council housing was built nearby, at <a href="Carrington%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Carrington</a> and <a href="Partington%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Partington</a>, for workers and their families. By 1985 the Shell plant had a turnover of about £200M and employed 1,150 people, but a major restructuring of the business reduced the workforce to less than 500 by 1986. By 1994, four distinct plants operated on the site, producing a range of chemicals, and materials including <a href="polystyrene">polystyrene</a>, <a href="polyethylene">polyethylene</a> and <a href="polypropylene">polypropylene</a>. In 2005 it was reported that Shell would close their polyols and ethoxylates units, a decision which came into effect in 2007. The estate is currently managed by chartered surveyors Bell Ingram. <a href="LyondellBasell">LyondellBasell</a> operate the last remaining chemical plant on site.

<a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> opened their <a href="Trafford%20Training%20Centre">Trafford Training Centre</a> <a href="training%20ground">training ground</a> and <a href="Football%20academy">Academy</a> in 2000, on land formerly owned by Shell. <a href="Bury%20F.C.">Bury F.C.</a>'s <a href="Carrington%20Training%20Centre">Carrington Training Centre</a>, formerly occupied by <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City F.C.</a>, is located nearby. Because of the Moss's history as a dumping ground for waste, bottle diggers often frequent the area. Several <a href="Rights%20of%20way%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">rights of way</a> exist on the land, and a <a href="Riding%20academy">horse-riding</a> school operates in the area.

At (53.42056, 2.38778), above sea level, Carrington Moss lies along the southern edge of the Lancashire Plain, an area of <a href="Bunter%20%28geology%29">Bunter sandstones</a> overlaid with <a href="marl">marl</a>s laid down during the <a href="Late%20Triassic">Late Triassic</a> period. These rocks are themselves overlaid by a layer of <a href="boulder%20clay">boulder clay</a> deposited during the last <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a>, about 10,000 years ago. The combination of the flat topography and the underlying clay resulted in extensive peat bogs developing along the <a href="River%20Mersey">Mersey</a> Valley, and overflowing beyond the valley. Along with large parts of <a href="Chat%20Moss">Chat Moss</a> and Holcroft Moss, Carrington Moss began to form during the <a href="Flandrian%20interglacial">Flandrian period</a> from 7100 to 5000 <a href="Before%20Present">BP</a>.

Carrington Moss is a lowland raised bog. The area drains slowly, which slows the decomposition of plant life and leads to the accumulation of peat. Over thousands of years this raises the level of peat and forms a gently sloping dome (hence, raised). Such areas support a wide range of <a href="flora">flora</a> and <a href="fauna">fauna</a>; "<a href="Sphagnum">Sphagnum balticum</a>", a medium-sized bog moss, was recorded on Carrington Moss in the 1880s, although locally it is now presumed to be extinct. Lancashire- or bog asphodel ("<a href="Narthecium%20ossifragum">Narthecium ossifragum</a>"), white beak-sedge ("<a href="Rhynchospora%20alba">Rhynchospora alba</a>"), <a href="Cranberry">cranberries</a>, bog-rosemary ("<a href="Andromeda%20polifolia">Andromeda polifolia</a>"), and the cotton sedge have also been recorded. In 1923 species of trees recorded by E. Price Evans for the "Journal of Ecology" included English oak ("<a href="Quercus%20robur">Quercus robur</a>"), and common ash ("<a href="Fraxinus%20excelsior">Fraxinus excelsior</a>"). Undergrowth included common hazel ("<a href="Corylus%20avellana">Corylus avellana</a>"), blackberry ("<a href="Rubus%20fruticosus">Rubus fruticosus</a>"), and European holly ("<a href="Ilex%20aquifolium">Ilex aquifolium</a>"). Several species of ground vegetation included creeping soft grass ("<a href="Holcus%20mollis">Holcus mollis</a>"), common bluebell ("<a href="Hyacinthoides%20non-scripta">Hyacinthoides non-scripta</a>"), common foxglove ("<a href="Digitalis%20purpurea">Digitalis purpurea</a>"), dog's mercury ("<a href="Mercurialis%20perennis">Mercurialis perennis</a>"), iris ("<a href="Iris%20pseudacorus">Iris pseudacorus</a>"), mad-dog weed ("<a href="Alisma%20plantago-aquatica">Alisma plantago-aquatica</a>"), and cat-o'-nine-tails ("<a href="Typha%20latifolia">Typha latifolia</a>").

<a href="Birch%20Moss%20Covert%20Nature%20Reserve">Birch Moss Covert</a> is a small woodland containing <a href="birch">birch</a>, <a href="alder">alder</a> and <a href="willow">willow</a> trees, as well as various species of flora and fauna. The small mammal population includes the <a href="wood%20mouse">wood mouse</a> ("Apodemus sylvaticus"), which attract both <a href="Common%20kestrel">kestrel</a> ("Falco tinnunculus") and <a href="Eurasian%20sparrowhawk">sparrowhawk</a> ("Accipiter nisus"). <a href="Fox">Fox</a>es, <a href="stoat">stoat</a>s, <a href="weasel">weasel</a>s, and <a href="badger">badger</a>s, are often seen. The area is part of Shell's estate, covering about of land managed by the <a href="Cheshire%20Wildlife%20Trust">Cheshire Wildlife Trust</a>. The trust also manages a small nature reserve located within Manchester United's training ground. This provides a habitat for a number of species including the red admiral butterfly ("<a href="Vanessa%20atalanta">Vanessa atalanta</a>"), meadow pipit ("<a href="Anthus%20pratensis">Anthus pratensis</a>"), and grey partridge ("<a href="Grey%20partridge">Perdix perdix</a>"). Carrington Moss is home to the only recorded pairs of breeding grey partridge in <a href="Trafford">Trafford</a>. Six pairs of Eurasian bullfinch ("<a href="Eurasian%20bullfinch">Pyrrhula pyrrhula</a>") were recorded in 2003. The reduction in the population of these and similar birds is attributed to modern farming methods, the loss of broad hedgerows, and the lack of winter stubble. Action for Nature in Trafford has therefore included the site in its Biodiversity Action Plan. The group intends to develop Carrington Moss as a home for other species, such as reed bunting ("<a href="Reed%20bunting">Emberiza schoeniclus</a>"). "<a href="Stigmella%20continuella">Stigmella continuella</a>" (a species of <a href="moth">moth</a> occurring in southern and north-west England) has been observed in the area.

<a href="Air%20Vice%20Marshal">Air Vice Marshal</a> Francis Masson (Frank) Bladin, (26 August 1898 – 2 February 1978) was a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). Born in rural <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, he graduated from the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, in 1920. Bladin transferred from the <a href="Australian%20Army">Army</a> to the Air Force in 1923, and learned to fly at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">RAAF Point Cook</a>, Victoria. He held training appointments before taking command of <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron</a> in 1934. Quiet but authoritative, he was nicknamed "Dad" in tribute to the concern he displayed for the welfare of his personnel.

Ranked <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> at the outbreak of World War II, by September 1941 Bladin had been raised to temporary <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a>. He became <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western Area</a> in March 1942, following the first <a href="Air%20raids%20on%20Australia%2C%201942%E2%80%9343">Japanese air raids</a> on <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Northern Territory. Personally leading <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s against enemy territory, he earned the United States <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a> for gallantry. In July 1943, Bladin was posted to <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B38%20Group%20RAF">No. 38 Group RAF</a> in Europe, where he was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a>. He was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> the same year.

Promoted acting <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a> in 1946, Bladin was among the coterie of senior officers who helped reshape the post-war RAAF. His roles in the late 1940s and early 1950s included Chief of Staff of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a> in Japan, Air Officer Commanding <a href="Eastern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Eastern Area</a> (later <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">RAAF Air Command</a>), and Air Member for Personnel. Appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in 1950, he retired to his country property in 1953. He was active for many years in veterans' affairs before his death in 1978 at the age of seventy-nine.

Frank Bladin was born on 26 August 1898 in <a href="Korumburra%2C%20Victoria">Korumburra</a>, Victoria, the youngest son of engineer Frederick Bladin and his wife Ellen. Educated to junior public level at <a href="Melbourne%20High%20School">Melbourne High School</a>, he sought to join the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> during World War I. His parents refused their permission, and he instead entered the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, in 1917. Graduating in 1920, Bladin served for the next two years in the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a>, including sixteen months <a href="Secondment">seconded</a> to the <a href="Royal%20Field%20Artillery">Royal Field Artillery</a> in Britain. He transferred to the recently established <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> as a <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> in January 1923. Undergoing pilot training at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">Point Cook</a>, Victoria, he was one of five former Army <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a>s on the inaugural RAAF flying course—all of whom had left their original service at least partly because of poor career prospects in the post-war military. One of Bladin's other classmates on the course was a 1919 graduate of the <a href="HMAS%20Creswell">Royal Australian Naval College</a>, Sub-Lieutenant <a href="Joe%20Hewitt%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Joe Hewitt</a>. During 1925–26, Bladin was in charge of running Citizens Air Force (reserve) pilots' courses at <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Flying Training School</a>, Point Cook. Having been promoted to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>, he married Patricia Magennis at <a href="Yass%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Yass</a>, New South Wales, on 20 December 1927; the couple had a son and two daughters.
Bladin was posted to Britain in 1929 to attend <a href="RAF%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">RAF Staff College, Andover</a>, and wrote an article on Empire air defence in 1931 for "Royal Air Force Quarterly", one of the few published pieces of work on air power produced by RAAF officers in the pre-war years. Promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a>, he took over as <a href="Commanding%20Officer">Commanding Officer</a> of <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron</a> from Squadron Leader <a href="Frank%20Lukis">Frank Lukis</a> in April 1934. Bladin found that the unit, flying <a href="Westland%20Wapiti">Westland Wapiti</a>s and <a href="Hawker%20Hart">Hawker Demons</a> out of <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Station Laverton</a> in Victoria, "had not operated under field conditions away from its brick hangars and concrete tarmac since its inception some eight years previous". He proceeded to change this, deploying the squadron 300 miles away to <a href="Cootamundra%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Cootamundra</a> in rural <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, where he "borrowed a portion of a sheep station from a friend so that the pilots could carry out their bombing practice" over a two-week period commencing in late November 1935.

After completing his tenure with No. 1 Squadron in December 1935, Bladin was appointed <a href="Officer%20Commanding">Officer Commanding</a> Cadet Squadron at No. 1 Flying Training School. He modelled the squadron's training course on that of Duntroon, foreshadowing instruction at the Air Force's own cadet institute, RAAF College, which would be established in 1947. On 12 March 1937, he was promoted to <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a>.

Bladin's first posting following the outbreak of World War II was as Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1940. Promoted to <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> in June, he became <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> <a href="Southern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Southern Area</a> in August 1941 and was raised to acting <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a> the following month. By 1 January 1942, Bladin was serving as Assistant Chief of the Air Staff (Operations), charged with readying air bases and putting into effect plans for the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a>. He took over as Air Officer Commanding <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western Area</a> (AOC NWA) on 25 March that year.

Based in <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Bladin's role was to conduct the air defence of <a href="Torres%20Strait">Torres Strait</a>, the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a>, and north <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>. He also had to restore morale following the <a href="bombing%20of%20Darwin">bombing of Darwin</a> on 19 February and deal with the threat of imminent invasion, tasks complicated by the poor state of local communications, transport and early warning systems. Initiating combat training for all RAAF ground crew, Bladin constructed secondary airfields so that he could disperse his forces. He became, in the words of historian Dr Alan Stephens, "the RAAF's outstanding area commander of the war", and earned distinction as the first Australian decorated by the United States in the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific theatre of operations</a> when he was awarded the <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a> for gallantry. The cited action took place in June when Bladin personally led a raid by <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">USAAF</a> <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">B-17 Flying Fortresses</a> on <a href="Sulawesi">Celebes</a> in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>. As well as destroying enemy machines on the ground and damaging infrastructure, the Allied bombers managed to evade an attack by nine Japanese fighters during their return to base. Bladin's award was recommended in September, and promulgated in the "Australian Gazette" on 23 November 1944.

By December 1942, Bladin's strength in NWA consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly <a href="Bristol%20Beaufighter">Bristol Beaufighter</a> and <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">P-40 Kittyhawk</a> fighters, <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a> light bombers, and <a href="Vultee%20A-31%20Vengeance">A-31 Vengeance</a> dive bombers. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies <a href="North%20American%20B-25%20Mitchell">B-25 Mitchell</a> medium bombers and USAAF <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a> heavy bombers. As Japanese air raids continued into 1943, Bladin placed his bombers inland, and his fighters close to the coast where they could intercept the raiders. Appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> on 1 January 1943, he stepped up offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the <a href="Timor%20Sea">Timor</a> and <a href="Arafura%20Sea">Arafura Sea</a>s as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese. He often employed his own judgement in the selection of targets, as detailed directives from superior headquarters were not always forthcoming. On 27 February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield, near <a href="Kupang">Koepang</a> on <a href="Timor">Timor</a>, that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to make a major raid on Darwin.
To help protect northern Australia from ongoing air attack, three squadrons of <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfire</a> fighters were transferred from the United Kingdom in late 1942, becoming operational in March 1943 as <a href="No.%201%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 1 Fighter Wing</a>. A <a href="Raid%20on%20Darwin%20%282%20May%201943%29">major engagement over Darwin</a> on 2 May resulted in eight Spitfires crashing and several others making forced landings, for the destruction of one Japanese bomber and five fighters. An adverse communiqué concerning the action was issued from General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>'s headquarters and was picked up by Australian newspapers, which reported the Spitfires' "heavy losses" and caused resentment in NWA. Bladin complained to his superior, Air Vice Marshal <a href="William%20Bostock">Bill Bostock</a>, that the "alarmist tendency of the press and radio references was having a bad effect on the combat pilots". He also ordered an immediate Beaufighter strike led by Wing Commander <a href="Charles%20Read%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Charles Read</a> against Penfui airfield, on the assumption that this was where the Japanese raiders were based; four enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground. On 17 June, under the command of Group Captain <a href="Clive%20Caldwell">Clive Caldwell</a>, No. 1 Fighter Wing recorded NWA's most successful interception to date, claiming fourteen Japanese raiders destroyed and ten damaged, for the loss of two Spitfires. The <a href="380th%20Air%20Expeditionary%20Wing">380th Bombardment Group USAAF</a>, consisting of four squadrons of Liberators, came under Bladin's control the same month, enhancing NWA's strategic strike capability. When Bladin handed over North-Western Area to Air Vice Marshal <a href="Adrian%20Cole%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Adrian Cole</a> in July 1943, the latter reported that his new command was "well organised, keen and in good shape".

Posted to England as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of <a href="No.%2038%20Group%20RAF">No. 38 Group RAF</a>, Bladin was closely involved in training aircrew and planning airborne operations for <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Operation Overlord</a>, the Allied invasion of France. He flew a mission on D-Day, 6 June 1944, to deliver glider-borne troops to <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>, and was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> two days later. Completing his RAF service on the staff of the <a href="RAF%20Second%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">Second Tactical Air Force</a> in France, Bladin returned to Australia to become <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a> in October 1944. On two occasions in June 1945, he was considered for the position of AOC <a href="RAAF%20Command">RAAF Command</a>, the Air Force's main operational formation in the South West Pacific. Bladin would have replaced Air Vice Marshal Bostock, who was facing disciplinary action for refusing to comply with directives from the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Air Board</a>, the RAAF's controlling body, but in the end the Australian government made no change to command arrangements.

The RAF had planned to deploy an airborne formation, No. 238 (Airborne Assault) Group, to the Pacific theatre and requested Bladin be released from his duties as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to assume its command, but this was cancelled with the end of hostilities in August 1945. His next posting was to <a href="Kure%2C%20Hiroshima">Kure</a>, Japan, in January 1946, as Chief of Staff to Lieutenant General <a href="John%20Northcott">John Northcott</a>, commander of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a> (BCOF). Northcott reportedly chose Bladin not only for his operational command and staff experience in the RAAF and the RAF during World War II, but for his pedigree as a Duntroon graduate rather than having a background that was confined to the Air Force alone. Promoted acting <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a> on 1 March 1946, he handed over to another Duntroon graduate, Air Vice Marshal <a href="John%20McCauley%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">John McCauley</a>, in June 1947. After returning to Australia, Bladin was to figure prominently, along with such figures as McCauley, Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt and Air Commodore (later Air Chief Marshal Sir) <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Frederick Scherger</a>, in reshaping the post-war Air Force.

Bladin's next command was <a href="Eastern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Eastern Area</a>, which would evolve over the years into Home Command, Operational Command and, finally, <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Air Command</a>. His acting rank of air vice marshal was made substantive on 1 October 1948. As AOC Eastern Area, Bladin was instrumental in organising the acquisition of a new site for his then-headquarters at <a href="RAAF%20Bradfield%20Park">Bradfield Park</a> on Sydney's <a href="North%20Shore%20%28Sydney%29">North Shore</a>, namely the former Lapstone Hotel at <a href="Glenbrook%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Glenbrook</a> in the <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28Australia%29">Blue Mountains</a>. Subsequently known as Headquarters Operational Command, later <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Glenbrook">Headquarters Air Command</a>, the site was purchased in mid-1949, and became operational at the end of the year. As well as commanding a view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within of the <a href="City%20of%20Penrith">City of Penrith</a> and of <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a>, and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered, according to government correspondence, "complete protection from <a href="Nuclear%20weapon">Atom Bomb</a> attack".
Bladin became Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 24 November 1948; this position gave him a seat on the Air Board, which consisted of the RAAF's most senior officers and was chaired by the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>. He succeeded Joe Hewitt, and worked to consolidate the innovations in Air Force education and training that the latter had initiated. RAAF Staff College was opened in June 1949 at Point Cook, providing an advanced defence course aimed at squadron leaders and wing commanders; various international facilities were also utilised to further officers' education. In October, Bladin became involved in the push for a Junior Equipment and Administrative Training Scheme to offer apprenticeships to clerical and supply staff, which was established two years later. He was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in the <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">King's Birthday Honours</a> announced in June 1950. In 1951, inspired by a similar initiative in state education, he sponsored a move to have RAAF education officers augment their <a href="Academic%20degree">degree qualifications</a> with formal <a href="Diploma%20of%20Education">teaching credentials</a>. Over the following year, in response to increased demands for aircrew to meet Australia's commitments to the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a> and the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, pilot training was broken out from a single all-encompassing course at No. 1 Flying Training School (No. 1 FTS) in Point Cook, Victoria, into separate courses at the newly formed <a href="No.%201%20Initial%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Initial Flying Training School</a> at <a href="Archerfield%2C%20Queensland">Archerfield</a>, Queensland, <a href="No.%201%20Basic%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Basic Flying Training School</a> at <a href="Uranquinty">Uranquinty</a>, New South Wales, and No. 1 Applied Flying Training School (re-formed from No. 1 FTS) at Point Cook.

Bladin retired from the Air Force on 15 October 1953, and was succeeded as AMP by Air Vice Marshal <a href="Valston%20Hancock">Val Hancock</a>. Shortly after leaving the Air Force, Bladin donated an eponymous trophy for the service's best-performing <a href="Avro%20Lincoln">Avro Lincoln</a> unit in bombing and aerial gunnery competition. He ran a <a href="Station%20%28Australian%20agriculture%29">grazing property</a>, which he <a href="Ad%20astra%20%28phrase%29">named "Adastra"</a>, at Yass, just north of the <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Australian Capital Territory</a>. Between 1951 and 1954, and again from 1956 to 1969, he also served as treasurer of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, which became the <a href="Returned%20and%20Services%20League%20of%20Australia">Returned Services League</a> in 1965. In the early 1960s he helped raise funds for building the <a href="Anzac">Anzac</a> Memorial Chapel of St Paul at his old college, Duntroon. Bladin died in Melbourne on 2 February 1978, survived by his three children. His wife, who was involved in the support of veterans' families and other community work, had died earlier. Accorded an Air Force funeral at the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in <a href="Balwyn%2C%20Victoria">Deepdene</a>, Frank Bladin was buried at <a href="Springvale%2C%20Victoria">Springvale</a>, Victoria.

Charles Carroll the Settler

Charles Carroll (1661–1720), sometimes called Charles Carroll the Settler to differentiate him from his son and grandson, was a wealthy <a href="lawyer">lawyer</a> and <a href="Plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South">planter</a> in colonial <a href="Province%20of%20Maryland">Maryland</a>. Carroll, a <a href="Catholic">Catholic</a>, is best known because his efforts to hold office in the <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a>-dominated colony (of Maryland) resulted in the <a href="disfranchisement">disfranchisement</a> of the colony's Catholics.

The second son of <a href="Irish%20Catholic">Irish Catholic</a> parents, Carroll was educated in <a href="France">France</a> as a lawyer before returning to <a href="England">England</a>, where he pursued the first steps in a legal career. Before that career developed, he secured a position as <a href="Maryland%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> of the young colony of Maryland. Its founder <a href="George%20Calvert%2C%201st%20Baron%20Baltimore">George Calvert</a> and his descendants intended it as a refuge for Catholics.

Carroll supported <a href="Charles%20Calvert%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Baltimore">Charles Calvert</a>, the colony's Catholic proprietor, in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the Protestant majority from gaining political control over Maryland. Following the overthrow of the Calvert proprietorship and the subsequent exclusion of Catholics from colonial government, Carroll turned his attention to planting, law, business, and various offices in the proprietor's remnant organization. He was the wealthiest man in the colony by the time of his death. In the last years of his life, Carroll attempted to regain some vestige of political power for Catholics in the colony, but the Protestant colonial assembly and Governor <a href="John%20Hart%20%28Governor%20of%20Maryland%29">John Hart</a> disfranchised them. His son, <a href="Charles%20Carroll%20of%20Annapolis">Charles Carroll of Annapolis</a>, became a wealthy planter and his grandson, <a href="Charles%20Carroll%20of%20Carrollton">Charles Carroll of Carrollton</a>, also wealthy, was the only Catholic signer of the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">United States Declaration of Independence</a>.

Carroll was the second of four sons born to Daniel Carroll of <a href="Aghagurty">Aghagurty</a> and <a href="Littermurna">Littermurna</a> (c. 1642–1688), a Catholic <a href="Ireland">Irishman</a> whose family lost much of their land and wealth in the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>. The exact place of his birth is unclear, though it likely occurred near the small town of Aghagurty that Carroll's father took as part of his name. Some of the family property near Aghagurty was obtained by a friend, Richard Grace, who made Daniel Carroll the head tenant. This action gave the family a livelihood, but the family continued to have limited means compared to their former status. It is likely that Charles Carroll was fostered by the wealthier Grace, who had no son; his greater resources could provide for the child's education.

With Grace's support, Carroll was able to attend school in France—at <a href="Lille">Lille</a> and at the <a href="University%20of%20Douai">University of Douai</a>—where he studied the humanities, philosophy, and civil and canon law. By May 1685, Carroll had moved to <a href="London">London</a>, where he registered to study English <a href="common%20law">common law</a> and was accepted into the <a href="Inner%20Temple">Inner Temple</a>, one of the four <a href="Inns%20of%20Court">Inns of Court</a> that are able to <a href="Call%20to%20the%20Bar">call members to the bar</a> and enable them to practice law. According to family tradition, Carroll secured a position as clerk to <a href="William%20Herbert%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Powis">William Herbert, 1st Marquess of Powis</a>, an Englishman who was one of two Catholic peers in the court of <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a>.

According to Carroll family tradition, Powis told his new clerk that he believed King James was receiving bad advice related to the religious turmoil in England. Powis was concerned about the consequences for English Catholics. He supposedly spoke on Carroll's behalf to an associate of his, <a href="Charles%20Calvert%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Baltimore">Charles Calvert</a>, proprietor of the Maryland colony. Charles Calvert's grandfather, <a href="George%20Calvert%2C%201st%20Baron%20Baltimore">George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore</a>, was a former member of <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament</a> and <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20%28England%29">Secretary of State</a> to <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I</a>, whose Catholicism had effectively ended his political career. Intense lobbying by George Calvert had led to the granting of a hereditary charter to the Calvert family. The Maryland colony was established in the 1630s on land granted by this charter. It was intended as a haven for English Catholics and other religious minorities. Powis may have encouraged Carroll to emigrate to Maryland with the hope that the younger man's career would come to greater fulfillment in a place with less religious conflict than England at the time.

Carroll received a commission from Calvert as the colony's <a href="Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> on July 18, 1688, and arrived in the colony in October 1688. En route, Carroll changed his family motto from "In fide et in bello forte" (strong in faith and war) to "Ubicumque cum libertate" (anywhere so long as there be freedom). Soon after he left, the Protestant <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William of Orange</a> invaded England, James II fled, and Parliament—which had been leery of James' Catholicism—recognized William and his wife <a href="Mary%20II%20of%20England">Mary</a> as the new King and Queen two weeks after Carroll's arrival in Maryland. This event, known as the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>, had profound implications for the future of the Maryland colony and for Carroll.

Soon after his arrival in Maryland, Carroll presented his commission to the colony's council and was recognized as the new Attorney General of the colony. He arrived in a place already riven by religious and class differences. Carroll and nearly the entire governing structure of the colony, with the exception of the lower house of the proprietary assembly, were appointed by Calvert. Most of the appointees were Catholic and wealthy, whereas the majority of the population and the lower house of the assembly were Protestant and less wealthy. Carroll arrived in Maryland just as long-standing economic, religious, and political tensions between the poorer Protestant majority and the wealthier and more powerful Catholic minority were reaching a head.

By the late 17th century, Maryland's economy was suffering from the effects of price fluctuations on the world market of its main cash crop, <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a>. Often in those years, the price on world markets was barely above the cost of production, leaving <a href="Plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South">planters</a> with little to show for their efforts. This affected small Protestant planters disproportionately, as many of the larger Catholic landowners had diversified economically. This growing socioeconomic inequality exacerbated underlying religious tensions. Furthermore, the new Governor, <a href="William%20Joseph%20%28governor%29">William Joseph</a>, who arrived in the colony just before Carroll, immediately entered into an adversarial relationship with the Protestant-dominated lower house of the assembly. Into this powder keg came the news that England's Glorious Revolution had taken place; the Catholic King <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a> had been deposed and replaced with the Protestant <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William of Orange</a>. In an attempt to maintain control in the colony, Governor Joseph quickly canceled the session of the colonial assembly scheduled for April 1689.

In response to this cancellation and rumors of an anti-Protestant alliance between Catholics and Native Americans, Protestant settlers formed an association to defend themselves. In July 1689, they marched on the colonial capital, <a href="St.%20Mary%27s%20City">St. Mary's City</a>. Led by <a href="John%20Coode%20%28Governor%20of%20Maryland%29">John Coode</a>, the Protestant associators were quickly able to capture St. Mary's and the other major towns of the colony. The Governor and a number of other Calvert allies fled to Virginia. Charles Calvert turned for relief to the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Lords of Trade</a> and eventually to the <a href="Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a>, but these groups sided with the Protestants and took away the power of the Calvert family to govern the colony. Soon thereafter, the new leaders of the colony barred Catholics from holding office, bearing arms, or serving on juries.

During the rebellion, Carroll was recovering from the "hard seasoning" often experienced by immigrants whose bodies were acclimatizing to local conditions. Perhaps due to illness, he chose not to flee the colony. Instead, Carroll offered support and legal advice to Calvert and became an outspoken critic of the Protestant government. He was jailed twice for insulting the new colonial leaders, including Governor <a href="Lionel%20Copley">Lionel Copley</a>, who accused Carroll of, "uttering several mutinous and seditious speeches". Losing his position in the colonial government and the £50 annual salary it entailed was a blow to Carroll. His support for Calvert earned him various positions in the private Calvert family organization, which would benefit him throughout his life.

Carroll improved his fortunes through a judicious marriage. In November 1689, he wed Martha Ridgely Underwood, a widow whose two former husbands had left her a small fortune. Carroll inherited a portion of this fortune after Martha's death in 1690 in childbirth. The child, named Anthony in honor of Carroll's brother, also died. Restricted in his law practice by the new Protestant government, Carroll used the inheritance to begin importing goods to the colony. He also purchased a store in the town of <a href="Annapolis">Annapolis</a>.

In February 1693 or 1694, Carroll remarried, this time to the 15-year-old daughter of Colonel <a href="Henry%20Darnall">Henry Darnall</a>, Charles Calvert's chief agent in the colony. The marriage to Mary Darnall secured Carroll a tract of land in <a href="Prince%20George%27s%20County%2C%20Maryland">Prince George's County</a>, a position in the colony's land office with a £100 annual salary, and a lifelong alliance with Henry Darnall. This tract of land was the first part of what would become a vast empire of nearly by the time of Carroll's death, worth approximately £20,000. Some of these lands were worked by the 112 <a href="slaves">slaves</a> he acquired during his lifetime. This was a very large number of slaves for a Maryland <a href="Plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South">planter</a> in the early colonial period. After 1706, Carroll and his family resided on two properties, a town house built in the new colonial capital of <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis</a> and the plantation called <a href="Doughoregan%20Manor">Dougheregan</a> in modern-day <a href="Howard%20County%2C%20Maryland">Howard County</a>.

As successful as Carroll was in business, however, he and his wife experienced many personal losses throughout this period. Of the ten children born to Charles and Mary Carroll, five died within a year of their birth. Henry, their eldest son, died the year before his father in 1719, at the age of 21 or 22. Only the third child, named Charles and later known as <a href="Charles%20Carroll%20of%20Annapolis">Charles Carroll of Annapolis</a>, and their next son Daniel would marry and have children of their own.

Henry Darnall died in 1711. Carroll took over Darnall's positions as agent and receiver general for the Calvert family in the colony, both posts with significant additional salaries. Among the many uses to which he put this money was lending. After 1713, he became the largest mortgage lender in the colony, and made a number of large personal loans to other planters. Carroll continued to practice law, making a small income from cases argued in the two courts where Catholics were still allowed to practice law, the <a href="Court%20of%20equity">chancery</a> and <a href="Prerogative%20court">prerogative</a> courts. His speculation in mercantile enterprises also continued. Together, these made Carroll the wealthiest man in the colony by 1715, and its most prominent Catholic.

In 1715, political power over the Maryland colony was restored to the Calvert family after the conversion of <a href="Benedict%20Calvert%2C%204th%20Baron%20Baltimore">Benedict Calvert</a> to Protestantism. Emboldened by this turn of events, and with support from a number of prominent Maryland Catholic families, Carroll attempted to gain government office in the state. This would have been a profound departure from the policy of excluding Catholics from government, which had existed since the Protestant takeover in 1689. Carroll's chief antagonist in this effort was the Governor, <a href="John%20Hart%20%28Governor%20of%20Maryland%29">John Hart</a>. In 1716, Hart discovered that Carroll was planning to travel to England to lobby Calvert's officials for restoration of office-holding rights for Catholics, something Hart vehemently opposed. Hart described Carroll as:

a professed Papist, and the first fomentor of our late Disturbances, who having acquired a large estate in the Province by the offices he formerly employed, and his practice in Law...must needs add the Ambition of Rule to his former Felicity.

Carroll travelled to England to press his case, although Hart later claimed that he had been promised no such lobbying would take place. Carroll convinced the proprietor's officials to appoint him as the proprietor's chief agent in the colony. He was further appointed to the positions of <a href="Receiver%20General">receiver general</a>, <a href="escheat">escheat</a>or, and naval officer. These positions together effectively gave Carroll the power to oversee all money in the colony that was collected by the government or by Calvert's private organization.

Upon Carroll's return to Maryland, Hart was incensed both at the threat to his own power and the idea of a Catholic officeholder in the colony. Hart demanded that Carroll take the <a href="oath%20of%20allegiance">oath of allegiance</a>, which he was willing to do, and the oath of abjuration confirming the Protestant succession to the English throne, which Carroll was not willing to do. Carroll began to act in the capacity authorized by the proprietor's commission, and Hart turned to the upper house of the colonial legislature for relief. Rejecting Carroll's arguments in support of his right to hold government offices, the assembly resisted his attempts to exercise the commission and, near the end of 1716, passed a series of laws confirming and restricting the oath requirements for officeholders, which were anti-Catholic by intent. Carroll's case may have been undermined when he came to the defense of his nephew, who had raised a toast to the Catholic <a href="James%20Francis%20Edward%20Stuart">James Stuart</a>. Stuart had tried to take the British throne during a rebellion in 1715 and was extremely unpopular with Protestants in the colony. The proprietor, whose position had been so recently restored and who did not want to risk the loss of the colony, confirmed the decision of the assembly. Carroll's commission was formally revoked on 20 February 1717. According to a later account Hart gave to the assembly, Carroll began a campaign to undermine the Governor. There is no evidence that Hart was accurate, but the assembly passed stricter anti-Catholic laws in 1718, including disfranchisement, stripping Catholic males of the right to vote.

Carroll died only two years later, with his wealth intact but having failed to regain any political rights for Catholics in Maryland. Carroll's eldest son Henry had died a year before; the family fortune and burden of heading a Catholic family in Protestant-dominated Maryland were passed on to his younger sons Charles and Daniel.

Carroll's descendants continued to play a prominent role in the colony. His son Charles, known as Charles Carroll of Annapolis, maintained and expanded the family fortune. His grandson, <a href="Charles%20Carroll%20of%20Carrollton">Charles Carroll of Carrollton</a>, achieved the restoration of political rights his grandfather had desired. He became the only Catholic to sign the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence</a>.

Alcohol laws of New Jersey

The state laws governing <a href="alcoholic%20drinks">alcoholic drinks</a> in <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> are among the most complex <a href="Alcohol%20laws%20of%20the%20United%20States">in the United States</a>, with many peculiarities not found in other states' laws. They provide for 29 distinct liquor licenses granted to manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and for the public warehousing and transport of alcoholic drinks. General authority for the <a href="Statute">statutory</a> and <a href="Regulation">regulatory</a> control of alcoholic drinks rests with the state government, particularly the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Division%20of%20Alcoholic%20Beverage%20Control">Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control</a> overseen by the state's <a href="New%20Jersey%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a>.

Under <a href="home%20rule">home rule</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> law grants individual <a href="municipality">municipalities</a> substantial discretion in passing <a href="municipal%20ordinance">ordinances</a> regulating the sale and consumption of alcoholic drinks within their limits. The number of retail licenses available is determined by a municipality's population, and may be further limited by the town's governing body. As a result, the availability of alcohol and regulations governing it vary significantly from town to town. A small percentage of municipalities in the state are "<a href="Dry%20county">dry towns</a>" that do not allow alcoholic drinks to be sold, and do not issue retail licenses for bars or restaurants to serve alcohol to patrons. Other towns permit alcohol sales 24 hours a day. Retail licenses tend to be difficult to obtain, and when available are subject to exorbitant prices and fervent competition.

In addition to granting local governments wide latitude over liquor sales, New Jersey law has some other unusual features. Corporations are limited to two retail distribution licenses, making it impractical for <a href="chain%20stores">chain stores</a> to sell alcoholic drinks; this restriction, in conjunction with municipal ordinances, severely limits <a href="supermarket">supermarket</a> and <a href="convenience%20store">convenience store</a> chains from selling beer as they do in many other states. State law treats <a href="driving%20under%20the%20influence">drunk driving</a> as a traffic offense rather than a crime, and permits individual municipalities to define the scope of <a href="minor%20in%20possession">underage drinking</a> laws.

New Jersey's history of <a href="tavern">tavern</a>s and alcohol production dates to its early colonial period. Colonial winemakers received recognition by the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Royal Society of Arts</a> for producing high-quality wine, and a <a href="Laird%20%26amp%3B%20Company">local distillery owner</a> was asked by <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> for his recipe for "cyder spirits" (<a href="applejack%20%28beverage%29">applejack</a>). Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, the industry developed with the influx of European immigrants, specifically <a href="German-Americans">Germans</a> and <a href="Italian-Americans">Italians</a>, who presented a sizable market for alcoholic drinks and brought with them old world winemaking, brewing, and distilling techniques. With the rise of the <a href="temperance%20movement">temperance movement</a> culminating in <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a> (1919–1933), New Jersey's alcohol industry suffered; many <a href="brewery">breweries</a>, <a href="winery">wineries</a>, and <a href="distillery">distilleries</a> either closed or relocated to other states. The legacy of Prohibition restricted and prevented the industry's recovery until the state legislature began loosening restrictions and repealing Prohibition-era laws starting in 1981. New Jersey's alcohol industry is experiencing a renaissance, and recently enacted laws provide new opportunities for the state's wineries and breweries.

New Jersey's laws and regulations regarding alcohol are overseen by the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Department%20of%20Law%20and%20Public%20Safety">Department of Law and Public Safety</a>'s Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC), which is managed by the state's Attorney General. The current director of the Alcohol Beverage Control division is <a href="Dave%20Rible">Dave Rible</a>. State and municipal laws, including those that regulate alcoholic drinks, apply in all <a href="territorial%20waters">territorial waters</a> which includes inland rivers, lakes, and bays, and tidal waters up to three <a href="nautical%20mile">nautical mile</a>s from the New Jersey <a href="shore">shore</a>line.

Starting in 1738, towns in New Jersey began issuing <a href="liquor%20license">liquor license</a>s to tavern keepers. Before federal <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a> in 1919, despite many state liquor statutes, the regulation of alcoholic drinks in New Jersey was almost exclusively local, with wide variations among municipalities. In 1933, after the <a href="Twenty-first%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">repeal of Prohibition</a>, the states were again permitted to regulate alcoholic drinks. Immediately upon the end of Prohibition in 1933, New Jersey instituted the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, which established and granted <a href="rulemaking">rulemaking</a> powers to the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control. The law also established a <a href="three-tier%20%28alcohol%20distribution%29">three-tier alcohol distribution</a> system whereby, with minor exceptions, alcohol manufacturers may only sell to <a href="wholesale">wholesale</a>rs, who may only sell to <a href="retail">retail</a>ers, who may only sell to customers.

New Jersey's alcohol laws and regulations are codified in Title 33 of the New Jersey Statutes, and Title 13, Chapter 2 of the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Administrative%20Code">New Jersey Administrative Code</a> respectively. After New Jersey's current <a href="New%20Jersey%20State%20Constitution">state constitution</a> was adopted in 1947 and some departments were consolidated, the department was incorporated into the Department of Law and Public Safety under the New Jersey Attorney General's office. The statutes define an alcoholic drink as "any fluid or solid capable of being converted into a fluid, suitable for human consumption, and having an alcohol content of more than one-half of one per centum (1/2 of 1%) by volume, including <a href="ethanol">alcohol</a>, <a href="beer">beer</a>, <a href="lager">lager beer</a>, <a href="ale">ale</a>, <a href="porter%20%28beer%29">porter</a>, naturally fermented wine, treated wine, blended wine, <a href="fortified%20wine">fortified wine</a>, <a href="sparkling%20wine">sparkling wine</a>, <a href="distilled%20liquor">distilled liquor</a>s, blended distilled liquors and any brewed, fermented or distilled liquors fit for use for drink purposes or any mixture of the same, and fruit juices."

New Jersey has a strong tradition of municipal <a href="home%20rule">home rule</a>. Local municipalities thus have considerable authority in the licensing and regulating of alcohol-related businesses. These powers include:

Retail licenses for consumption or distribution are allocated proportionally to a municipality's population. Licenses permitting on-premises retail sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages (i.e. bars and restaurants) are allocated at a ratio of one license for 3,000 residents. Distribution licenses are available at a ratio of one license per 7,500 residents. Small towns with populations less than 1,000 can issue at least one consumption and one distribution license. Given the regulatory latitude allowed municipalities, the actual number of licenses extant in a municipality may more or less depend on a variety of factors, including:
Because the law grants a municipality significant regulatory latitude, 35 of the state's 565 municipalities are currently dry. Conversely, because of the grandfathering of licenses, several municipalities have a substantially higher ratio of licenses. For instance, the <a href="resort%20town">resort town</a> of <a href="Wildwood%2C%20New%20Jersey">Wildwood</a> has a permanent population of 5,300, but 61 active liquor licenses.

<a href="Casino">Casino</a>s in <a href="Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Atlantic City</a> and federal enclaves (e.g. military bases, national parks) are not under the jurisdiction of either the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control or municipal alcoholic beverage control boards. The <a href="New%20Jersey%20Division%20of%20Gaming%20Enforcement">New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement</a> and the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Casino%20Control%20Commission">New Jersey Casino Control Commission</a> are responsible for the regulation of alcoholic beverages at casinos. Per Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>, the federal government may "exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, and other needful buildings." While some state laws do apply in federal enclaves, court decisions have exempted military bases and other federal lands from state and local alcohol laws.

New Jersey law provides for 29 distinct liquor licenses divided into the following five classes: Class A for manufacturers, Class B for wholesalers, Class C for retailers, Class D for transportation licenses, and Class E for public warehouses. State law allows the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control to create temporary permits "to provide for contingencies where it would be appropriate and consonant with the spirit of this chapter to issue a license, but the contingency has not been expressly provided for." Special permits are allowed to range in price from $10 to $2000, are limited to 25 days per year for a given premises, and currently there are 3 types of permits for non-licensees. Excluding seasonal licenses and special permits, ABC licenses are issued for one year starting on July 1, and ending on June 30.

The number of Class C retail licenses for bars, restaurants, and liquor stores is limited by population and often by municipal ordinances. Licenses are typically obtained from existing licensees who choose to sell, or when a new license is offered as a town's population grows. As a result, the price for a retail license is often prohibitively expensive. The sale of a new license is usually conducted by <a href="public%20auction">public auction</a>. The intense competition can benefit a town by generating several hundred thousand dollars of revenue from the highest bidder. A 2006 license auction in <a href="Cherry%20Hill%2C%20New%20Jersey">Cherry Hill, New Jersey</a> set the state record at $1.5 million.

Supermarkets, convenience stores, and gas stations in New Jersey rarely sell alcoholic beverages because state law prohibits any person or corporation from possessing more than two retail distribution licenses. While licenses for bars, restaurants and liquor stores are limited, other retail licenses are not. Class C licenses can be granted without limit for <a href="common%20carrier">common carrier</a>s (such as <a href="limousine">limousine</a>s and boats), private clubs with a minimum of 60 members, <a href="hotel">hotel</a>s with at least one-hundred rooms, and <a href="theatre">theatre</a>s with at least 1,000 seats.

Special permits exist to allow for the sale of alcoholic beverages at golf courses, government-owned facilities, and at social events run by <a href="non-profit%20organizations">non-profit organizations</a> (for example, church <a href="traveling%20carnival">carnival</a>s). A restaurant in New Jersey without a liquor license can sell wine from a New Jersey winery by becoming an offsite retail <a href="outlet%20store">sales outlet</a> of the winery. Since the early 1990s, there have been a handful of unsuccessful proposals to create a separate restaurant license allowing eating establishments to sell beer and wine. Such proposals have been strongly opposed by current retail license holders who believe that it would decrease their income, and thus the value of their liquor license.

Some municipalities, particularly in <a href="South%20Jersey">South Jersey</a>, are dry towns where no alcohol can be legally served or sold. Some of them are dry because of their origins as <a href="Society%20of%20Friends">Quaker</a>, <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a>, or other <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> religious communities. For example, the seaside resort town of <a href="Ocean%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Ocean City</a> has been dry since it was founded in 1879 by four Methodist clergymen. In recent years, several municipalities have questioned whether they ought to remain dry. Dry towns frequently have <a href="Referendum">public referendums</a> on whether they should remain dry or allow liquor sales in order to attract new businesses and increase <a href="property%20tax">property tax</a> revenue.

Dry towns in New Jersey cannot forbid the possession, consumption, or transportation of alcohol, but have the option to permit or prohibit BYOB at restaurants and social affair permits for non-profit organizations. In 2012, Ocean City residents rejected a proposal to allow restaurant patrons to bring their own wine or beer to unlicensed establishments. It is possible for a dry town to have a <a href="winery">winery</a> or <a href="brewery">brewery</a> that offers <a href="wine%20tasting">tasting</a>s, since alcohol manufacturing licenses in New Jersey are issued by the state, and are not regulated by municipalities. , there are <a href="List%20of%20dry%20communities%20by%20U.S.%20state%23New%20Jersey">35 dry municipalities in New Jersey</a>, down from 44 in 2002.

Some dry towns permit the sale of alcohol if it is produced on site.

The hours of sale for on-premises consumption are regulated by local ordinance, and <a href="last%20call%20%28bar%20term%29">closing times</a> vary by town. Atlantic City does not have closing hours, and alcohol can be purchased at its casinos and local bars 24 hours a day. With the exception of <a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Newark</a> and <a href="Jersey%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Jersey City</a>, the law forbids <a href="hard%20liquor">hard liquor</a> packaged goods sales before 9 am and after 10 pm any day of the week. This can be restricted further by local ordinance. Liquor stores may sell beer and wine during any hours that on-premises sales are allowed.

New Jersey regulations for liquor stores and bars are extensive. Licensed establishments may not offer nudity. It is illegal to sell liquor below cost, charge a flat fee for unlimited drinks (except for private parties and on <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve">New Year's Eve</a>), offer any promotion that is contingent on drinking a certain amount of alcohol, allow patrons to remain after closing time, or sell liquor at a drive-through window. Bars and clubs are prohibited from having a 'ladies' night' or any pricing which is regarded as discriminatory. <a href="Police%20officers">Police officers</a> are prohibited from working for licensed businesses in the same town where they are employed, and some municipalities require <a href="fingerprint">fingerprint</a>ing for all liquor store and bar employees.

<a href="Gambling">Gambling</a> and related <a href="paraphernalia">paraphernalia</a>, broadly defined by ABC to include <a href="claw%20crane">claw and crane machines</a>, casino-themed <a href="video%20games">video games</a>, <a href="betting%20pool">football pools</a>, and <a href="door%20prize">door prize</a>s, irrespective of whether any profit is being made by the business, are prohibited at licensed establishments. The only exceptions are for those bars licensed by the state to sell lottery tickets or have <a href="off-track%20betting">off-track betting</a> on horse racing. Charity <a href="Bingo%20%28U.S.%29">bingo</a> games or <a href="raffle">raffle</a>s are also allowed. <a href="Card%20games">Card games</a>, <a href="darts">darts</a>, <a href="billiards">billiards</a> and other games are permitted as long as no money is exchanged, and no prizes are given.

ABC regulations permit a bar owner or employee to give away a free drink as long as it is not advertised. Businesses may issue free or complimentary drink coupons (up to one per day per patron). Hotel and motel licensees may also give guests complimentary bottles of wine on special occasions. Licensed establishments are permitted to institute <a href="dress%20codes">dress codes</a>, <a href="cover%20charge">cover charge</a>s, and minimum age restrictions. Liquor stores are allowed to conduct tastings of beer, wine, and spirits. Bars, restaurants, state <a href="concession%20%28contract%29">concessionaires</a> (e.g. <a href="PNC%20Bank%20Arts%20Center">PNC Bank Arts Center</a>), and non-profit organizations with a special permit can host both tastings and tasting dinners, the latter of which permits larger sample sizes.

Because some restaurants are unable or choose not to get a retail consumption license, the practice of "bring your own bottle" (BYOB) is prevalent in establishments statewide. Patrons are permitted to bring their own beer or wine to a restaurant that does not possess a liquor license, as long as there is no municipal prohibition against it. By law, a BYOB restaurant may not allow consumption of hard liquor or <a href="mixed%20drinks">mixed drinks</a>, nor may it allow consumption of beer or wine by those under 21, visibly intoxicated, or during hours in which the sale of these products is prohibited by licensees in that municipality (i.e. after closing time). Establishments offering BYOB are not allowed to assess a cover charge, charge a <a href="BYOB%20%28beverage%29%23Corkage">corkage fee</a>, nor advertise that patrons may bring beer or wine. A restaurant or other business with a retail consumption license may allow consumers to bring their own beer or wine, though many do not.

New Jersey law prohibits <a href="strip%20club">strip club</a>s and "<a href="sexually%20oriented%20business">sexually oriented business</a>", where <a href="striptease">striptease</a>s and <a href="Erotic%20dancing">erotic dances</a> are regularly performed, from offering both full nudity and alcohol sales. Establishments that possess a retail license and serve alcohol can only offer partially clothed services such as <a href="go-go%20dancing">go-go dancing</a> (typically in bikinis or lingerie). Clubs that are not licensed to serve alcohol will work around the restriction by implementing a bring your own bottle (BYOB) policy and operating as a "<a href="juice%20bar">juice bar</a>". Juice bars have the appointments of full bars but only serve non-alcoholic beverages such as water, <a href="Juice">fruit juice</a>, and flavored <a href="carbonated%20beverage">carbonated beverage</a>s. Such a bar could double as a service counter for the storage of BYOB material and offer ice and mixing services to create mixed drinks using the customer-purchased ingredients. Recent court decisions have held that municipalities that allow BYOB policies for restaurants must allow the same practices for strip clubs.

In 1981, the <a href="New%20Jersey%20State%20Legislature">state legislature</a> began to reform the laws that governed the production of alcoholic beverages. With the passing of the New Jersey Farm Winery Act in 1981, and laws providing for licenses for brewpubs and microbreweries in the 1990s, these two industries have grown significantly and the number of wineries and breweries have steadily increased. In February 2013, New Jersey issued the first new distillery license since before Prohibition, and legislation has been proposed to make it easier to establish craft distilleries in New Jersey. , New Jersey currently has 48 wineries, 28 breweries, and 2 distilleries.

New Jersey <a href="winemaking">winemaking</a> dates to the <a href="Colonial%20history%20of%20New%20Jersey">colonial period</a>. In 1767, two landowners, <a href="Edward%20Antill%20%28colonial%20politician%29">Edward Antill</a> and <a href="William%20Alexander%2C%20Lord%20Stirling">William Alexander, Lord Stirling</a>, were recognized by the Royal Society of Arts in London, which had challenged colonists in <a href="British%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">British North America</a> to cultivate "vinifera" grapes and produce "those Sorts of Wines now consumed in Great Britain." Shortly after, Antill wrote an 80-page instructional essay on <a href="viticulture">grape cultivation</a> and winemaking that was published in the "Transactions of the American Philosophical Society."

While the cultivation of grapes and fruit trees supported a flourishing wine industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the effects of Prohibition and a legacy of restrictive laws after its repeal devastated the industry. For 50 years, New Jersey was limited by law to one winery license for every 1,000,000 state residents, which by 1980 effectively allowed for only seven wineries. The growth of the state's winery industry has been bolstered by the 1981 <a href="New%20Jersey%20Farm%20Winery%20Act">New Jersey Farm Winery Act</a>, which repealed many Prohibition-era laws and allowed many small growers to open new wineries.

, New Jersey has 48 licensed and operating wineries which produce wine <a href="New%20Jersey%20wine%23Wines%20produced">from more than 90 varieties of grapes, and from over 25 other fruits</a>. Many New Jersey wineries sell their products at festivals that are held annually throughout the state. In 2012, 1.56 million gallons (approximately 656,000 cases) of wine were produced by New Jersey wineries, making it the ninth-largest wine-producing state. A considerable portion of those are non-grape fruit wine, particularly <a href="apple">apple</a>, <a href="blueberry">blueberry</a>, <a href="raspberry">raspberry</a>, and <a href="cranberry">cranberry</a> wines; fruits produced by many farms in the state. The state's wineries generate between $30–40 million of revenue annually. New Jersey law treats <a href="cider">hard cider</a> as a type of wine because it is made from fermented fruits. Although there is currently no licensed hard cider production in New Jersey, cider can be produced with a plenary or farm winery license, and several businesses have taken preliminary steps in establishing <a href="cider%20mill">cider mill</a>s.

The first brewery in New Jersey was established in a fledgling <a href="Dutch%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">Dutch settlement</a> in what is now <a href="Hoboken%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hoboken</a> when the state was part of the <a href="New%20Netherland">New Netherland</a> colony. It was soon destroyed by a band of <a href="Lenape">Lenape</a> in 1643 during <a href="Kieft%27s%20War">Governor Kieft's War</a> (1643–1645). Large German immigrant populations in Newark and Jersey City led to the establishment of a healthy brewing industry in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Brewing beer became the fourth-largest industry in Newark, with names like Kruger, Hensler, and <a href="Christian%20William%20Feigenspan">Feigenspan</a> among the leading industrial families in Newark.

Later, regional (and later national) brands <a href="Ballantine%20Brewery">Ballantine</a>, and <a href="Rheingold%20Beer">Rheingold</a>, and <a href="Pabst%20Brewing%20Company">Pabst</a>, among others, operated large breweries in Newark and surrounding towns. With accusations of German propaganda and persecution of German-Americans during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, many of the state's brewers relocated to the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwestern United States</a> Prohibition closed many of the remaining breweries in the state. For instance, of Newark's 27 breweries before Prohibition, none exist today. As the industry reorganized and consolidated in the 1970s and 1980s to compete nationally, the larger producers like Ballantine (in the 1960s) Rheingold (1977), and Pabst (1985) closed their doors.

<a href="Anheuser-Busch">Anheuser-Busch</a> still operate a large-production brewery in Newark, originally opened in 1951, which is used for brewing <a href="Budweiser%20%28Anheuser-Busch%29">Budweiser</a> and <a href="Rolling%20Rock">Rolling Rock</a>. New Jersey offers a limited brewery license for <a href="microbrewery">microbreweries</a> and a restricted brewery license for brewpubs. In 1995, the Ship Inn Restaurant and Brewery in <a href="Milford%2C%20New%20Jersey">Milford</a> became the first brewpub in New Jersey. Within ten years, the industry expanded to 28 breweries, most of them microbreweries or brewpubs. In 2010, New Jersey craft brewers produced 32,000 barrels (992,000 gallons) of craft brew. In 2012, New Jersey liberalized its licensing laws to allow microbreweries to sell beer by the glass as part of a tour, and sell up to 15.5 gallons (i.e. a keg) for off-premises consumption. The same legislation permits brewpubs to brew up to 10,000 barrels of beer per year, and sell to wholesalers and at festivals.

New Jersey has had a long distilling history dating to the colonial era when large landowners converted surplus fruit into brandy, sugar into rum, and grain into whiskey. Until recently, New Jersey had only one licensed distillery, <a href="Laird%20%26amp%3B%20Company">Laird & Company</a> in <a href="Scobeyville%2C%20New%20Jersey">Scobeyville</a> (<a href="Colts%20Neck%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Colts Neck</a>). Founded by Robert Laird, it is the oldest licensed distillery in the United States and received License No. 1 from the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">U.S. Department of the Treasury</a> in 1780. George Washington, who was acquainted with the distillery's owner, once asked him for his recipe for "cyder spirits." By 1834, New Jersey boasted 388 distilleries.

Today, Laird is the nation's only remaining producer of <a href="Applejack%20%28beverage%29">applejack</a>. Presently none of the company's distilling takes place in New Jersey. Laird's obtains all its apples from Virginia's <a href="Shenandoah%20Valley">Shenandoah Valley</a> and distills its products in Virginia. Distilling at its New Jersey facilities ceased in 1972 and Laird's blends, ages and bottles its products in Scobeyville. In February 2013, the state issued the first distillery license since Prohibition to <a href="Jersey%20Artisan%20Distilling">Jersey Artisan Distilling</a> of <a href="Fairfield%20Township%2C%20Essex%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Fairfield</a>, which currently produces and sells <a href="rum">rum</a>. <a href="http%3A//jerseyspirits.com/">Jersey Spirits Distilling Company</a> set up their craft distillery in February, 2015 also located in <a href="Fairfield%20Township%2C%20Essex%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Fairfield Township, Essex County, New Jersey</a> and became the first distillery to manufacture and distribute a true Bourbon Whiskey completely in New Jersey since before Prohibition days. Their handmade grain to bottle products include Vodka, Rum, Gin, White Whiskey, Bourbon and Jersey Hooch. <a href="http%3A//claremontdistillery.com/">Claremont Distillery</a> in Fairfield, NJ began distilling in May 2015. They're producing vodka, whiskey, and a retail moonshine called Jersey Devil Moonshine, after the New Jersey Pine Barons legend. <a href="http%3A//skunktowndistillery.com/">Skunktown Distillery</a> in Flemington, NJ opened their doors to the public in December 2016. Skunktown Distillery produces Vodka, Spicy Vodka (made with the Carolina Reaper pepper), Silver Rum, Oaked Rum - a unique flavor of bourbon with a mild rum backing, Rye Whiskey, Golden Gin and the state's finest Apple Pie Moonshine. <a href="http%3A//pinetaverndistillery.com/">Pine Tavern Distillery</a> in Monroeville New Jersey was the First Licensed Farm Based Distillery in New Jersey Since Prohibition Their License was obtained February 3, 2016. They produce Muddy Run Jersey Style Rum, Vodka and a spirit the call Honey White. They also have a line of Aged Whiskeys, Fenwick's New Salem Single Barrel Bourbon & Rye Whiskey. A portion of all Fenwick's bottle sales are Donated to the Salem County Historic Society.

Other prospective distillers, <a href="Cooper%20River%20Distillers">Cooper River Distillers</a> in <a href="Camden%2C%20New%20Jersey">Camden</a> and <a href="Corgi%20Spirits">Corgi Spirits</a> <a href="http%3A//corgispirits.com"></a> in <a href="Jersey%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Jersey City, New Jersey</a> are on the path to obtaining licenses in the near future. Others are expected to follow. In August 2013, the state passed a law creating a <a href="microdistillery%23Craft%20distillery">craft distillery</a> license. The license costs substantially less than the plenary distillery license ($938 versus $12,500), but limits production to 20,000 gallons per year. Distillers who certify that at least 51 percent of raw materials used in the distillation are grown or bought from providers in the state can label their product "New Jersey distilled."

Until 2004, New Jersey permitted in-state wineries to directly ship products to in-state customers. The state did not allow out-of-state producers to ship to New Jersey residents or permit New Jersey wineries to ship to out-of-state customers. This practice was declared unconstitutional by the <a href="U.S.%20Supreme%20Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> in 2005 in a case from <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. New Jersey's statute was subsequently struck down by the <a href="U.S.%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Third%20Circuit">Third Circuit Court of Appeals</a> in 2010 because such limitations were held to violate the <a href="Interstate%20Commerce%20Clause">Interstate Commerce Clause</a> of the U.S. Constitution.

On 17 January 2012, <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20Jersey">New Jersey Governor</a> <a href="Chris%20Christie">Chris Christie</a> signed into law a bill that legalized direct shipping from wineries to consumers, and permits New Jersey wineries to open as many as 15 offsite retail sales outlets in the state. The law allows wineries that make less than 250,000 gallons of wine annually, which includes all of New Jersey's wineries, to ship up to 12 cases of wine to per year to any person over 21 in New Jersey or any other state that allows <a href="Wine%20shipping%20laws%20in%20the%20United%20States">wine shipments</a>. Because this prohibits 90% of wine made in the United States, but does not affect New Jersey's small wineries, proponents of the law fear that this section of the law will be struck down as unconstitutional. The <a href="U.S.%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20First%20Circuit">U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> had struck down a similar limit in Massachusetts in 2008 in light of the United States Supreme Court decision addressing direct shipping laws a few years earlier.

Federal law prohibits alcoholic beverages from being shipped through the mail. New Jersey effectively prohibits the shipment of beer and spirits to customers by requiring a liquor license to transport alcohol, but not having any class of liquor license that grants permission to ship beer or spirits. <a href="United%20Parcel%20Service">United Parcel Service</a> (UPS) and <a href="Federal%20Express">Federal Express</a> will ship wine to a person's home, but will only deliver beer or hard liquor to a licensed business. Although uncommon, it is legal for a liquor store to deliver alcoholic beverages by car or van to a person's home. ABC regulations mandate that the alcoholic beverages being delivered are paid for in advance, that they are received by someone 21 or older, and that they take place when the licensed establishment is permitted to be open.

A person must be at least 21 years old in New Jersey to purchase alcoholic beverages in a retail establishment, or to possess or consume alcoholic beverages in a <a href="public%20space">public</a> (for example, a park or on the street) or <a href="public%20space%23Semi-public%20spaces">semi-public area</a> (e.g. restaurant, automobile). A person only needs to be 18 to own a liquor license, or to sell or serve alcohol (for example, a <a href="waiter">waiter</a>). State law also prohibits an underage person from misrepresenting their age in a licensed establishment.

It is illegal to serve alcohol to anyone under 21, encourage an underage person to drink, knowingly allow underage drinking on property that one owns or leases, or possess alcoholic beverages on <a href="state%20school">public school</a> property without written consent of the <a href="school%20board">school board</a> or <a href="school%20principal">school principal</a>. State law grants an exemption for religious services, and for parents and guardians over 21 who serve alcohol to their own children in a private location (such as a private home).

New Jersey and all other U.S. states comport with the requirement of the <a href="National%20Minimum%20Drinking%20Age%20Act">National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984</a>, which sought to set a national standard of 21 as the minimum age for purchasing and publicly possessing alcoholic beverages. To make states comply, Congress tied a state's failure to enact a drinking age at 21 to a punitive decrease in a state's apportionment of federal highway funding. Federal law requires <a href="colleges">colleges</a> and <a href="universities">universities</a> that accept federal <a href="student%20financial%20aid%20in%20the%20United%20States">financial aid</a> institute policies to sanction students who violate underage drinking and other alcohol laws, and to track the number of liquor laws violations. "<a href="The%20Chronicle%20of%20Higher%20Education">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>" has reported that many colleges fail to comply with these laws, and federal enforcement is minimal.

There is no state law prohibiting consumption of alcohol by minors while on private property, but many municipalities prohibit underage consumption unless parents or adult relatives are present. Public schools are not permitted to have "24/7" conduct policies which sanction students for alcohol consumption outside of school. Minors are allowed to enter licensed establishments, and while state law does not prohibit bars and <a href="nightclubs">nightclubs</a> from having events such as "teen nights," or "18 to party, 21 to drink," some municipalities impose restrictions. It is legal for a person under 21 to be in a location where underage drinking is occurring, and New Jersey does not have an "internal possession" statute criminalizing underage drinking after the fact.

The state underage drinking statute is a disorderly persons offense (misdemeanor), which upon conviction is punishable by up to 6 months in jail (rarely imposed), a $500–$1000 fine, and a mandatory 6-month suspension of the person's <a href="driver%27s%20license%20in%20the%20United%20States">driver's license</a>. The penalties are the same for using fake identification. Those who unlawfully serve alcohol to an underage person, entice an underage person to drink, knowingly permit underage drinking on their property, or bring alcohol onto a public school property face similar sanctions, except that their driver's license will not be suspended. A licensed business which serves alcohol to a person under age 21, even unintentionally, may be fined or have their liquor license suspended or revoked.

Violation of a municipal underage drinking statutes is a <a href="civil%20penalty">non-criminal offense</a>, which has a fine of $250 for the first offense, and $350 for subsequent offenses. A person's driver's license can be suspended for a municipal underage drinking conviction, but usually it just results in a <a href="fine%20%28penalty%29">fine</a> without a court appearance being required. There is a "<a href="medical%20amnesty%20policy">good samaritan</a>" defense to an underage drinking <a href="criminal%20charge">charge</a> – if an underage drinker calls for medical help for another underage drinker who is ill, and cooperates with law enforcement and medical responders, neither may be <a href="prosecutor">prosecuted</a>. It is common for a state underage drinking charge to be downgraded to a municipal ordinance violation in order for the defendant to avoid a <a href="criminal%20record">criminal record</a> and a suspended license. The <a href="statute%20of%20limitations">statute of limitations</a> for both state and municipal underage drinking charges is one year.

The first <a href="U.S.%20history%20of%20alcohol%20minimum%20purchase%20age%20by%20state">drinking age</a> law in New Jersey was passed in 1846. It allowed the parents of a student under 21 to <a href="lawsuit">sue</a> for up to $10 ($ in modern dollars) in <a href="damages">damages</a> against a tavern keeper or shopkeeper who supplied alcoholic beverages to their children. In 1880, a criminal statute was enacted, fining businesses that sold liquor to people under 18 if their parents had told the establishment not to sell to their child. The law was amended in 1888 to eliminate the <a href="parental%20consent">parental consent</a> provision, thus making it illegal in all cases for a tavern or liquor store to sell alcohol to person under 18. In 1908, the penalties were increased so that a tavern keeper who served a <a href="minor%20%28law%29">minor</a> could be jailed. Upon the start of Prohibition, New Jersey repealed its laws regarding the sale of alcohol to minors since the <a href="Eighteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution</a> prohibited almost all liquor sales.

Upon repeal of Prohibition and the passage of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, the ABC issued regulations that prohibited bars and liquor stores from selling alcohol to a person under 21, which was considered the <a href="age%20of%20majority">age of majority</a> at that time. In 1939, it became a criminal offense to sell alcohol to a person under 21, and for a person under 21 to purchase or consume alcohol in a licensed establishment. The state criminalized the underage possession of alcohol in motor vehicles and other public areas in 1957, possibly in response to young New Jerseyans traveling to <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, where the drinking age was 18, and returning home with liquor. For many years laws against underage drinking and the serving of alcohol to minors did not apply on private property, though an adult who supplied a substantial amount of liquor to an underage person could possibly be prosecuted for <a href="juvenile%20delinquency">contributing to the delinquency of a minor</a> Furthermore, <a href="arrest">arrest</a>s and criminal prosecutions for underage drinking in bars or public areas were very uncommon before the 1980s.

New Jersey's drinking age was lowered to 18 in 1973 as part of a broader legal change which reduced New Jersey's age of majority from 21 to 18. Much of the impetus for lowering the drinking age to 18 was to grant returning <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam</a> <a href="veterans">veterans</a> the right to purchase alcohol. Possibly because of concerns about 18-year-old <a href="high%20school">high school</a> students being able to legally purchase liquor, and then illegally consume it school, the state raised the drinking age to 19 in 1980. Citing statistics that indicated an increase in car deaths among drivers under 21, the drinking age was raised back to 21 in 1983. At the same time, the penalties for underage drinking were increased to include a mandatory driver's license suspension. In 1985, the state made it illegal for an adult to give alcohol to a person under 21, with exception for religious services and parents serving alcohol to their own children at home or in a private area.

Historically, a few municipalities had ordinances against underage drinking on private property, but a <a href="class%20action">class action</a> lawsuit in 1998 against the town of <a href="Avalon%2C%20New%20Jersey">Avalon</a> nullified these laws. In 2000, the New Jersey Legislature passed a bill criminalizing underage consumption of alcoholic beverages on private property New Jersey Governor <a href="Christine%20Whitman">Christine Whitman</a> <a href="pocket%20veto">pocket veto</a>ed the bill over privacy concerns: "While I completely support the intent of the bill, I am concerned that the bill's prohibitions could be construed to apply to situations in which an underage person consumes even a small amount of alcohol under the watchful eye of an adult family member." Later that year, Whitman signed a revised bill that allowed municipalities to pass ordinance prohibiting underage drinking on private property. Besides giving municipalities a choice on whether to implement such a policy, the revised bill imposed substantially lighter penalties on underage drinkers, and the new law made an exception for alcohol provided by any relative, not just a parent or guardian.

Like all other US states, New Jersey sets a 0.08 percent weight by volume <a href="blood%20alcohol%20content">blood alcohol content (BAC)</a> as the threshold for intoxication when operating a motor vehicle (e.g. automobile, boat). It is possible to be charged with <a href="driving%20under%20the%20influence">driving under the influence (DUI)</a> with a BAC level below 0.08%, but there is a presumption in that situation that the driver is not intoxicated. State law prohibits those under 21 from driving if their BAC is 0.01% or more, prohibits the operation of a <a href="commercial%20vehicle">commercial vehicle</a> with a BAC of 0.04% or more, and mandates that drivers submit a breath sample if requested by a police officer. To be convicted of DUI in New Jersey, a person must be operating or attempting to operate a motorized vehicle; thus activities such as sleeping in a car while intoxicated or bicycling while drunk are not illegal.

Drivers are not legally required to take <a href="Driving%20under%20the%20influence%23Field%20sobriety%20testing">field sobriety tests</a>, although the results are admissible in court. The Alcotest has replaced the <a href="Breathalyzer">Breathalyzer</a> as the standard device for determining blood alcohol level. When a driver is arrested for DUI, the police are prohibited from using force to obtain a breath, blood, or urine sample, and must warn the driver of the consequences of refusing a breath sample. In 2010, the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Supreme%20Court">New Jersey Supreme Court</a> overturned the breath sample refusal conviction of a non-English speaking driver, ruling that drivers must be notified of the law in a language that they understand. A person can be charged with DUI or breath refusal up to 90 days after the incident, except in cases of serious injury or death, in which case the statute of limitations is 5 years.

New Jersey is one of only two states (along with <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>) that classify DUI as a <a href="traffic%20code">traffic violation</a>, and not a criminal offense, except in cases of serious injury or death. Because it is not a criminal offense, those charged in New Jersey with DUI and related offenses are not fingerprinted, do not have the right to a <a href="jury%20trial">jury trial</a>, DUI arrests and convictions are not submitted to the <a href="FBI">FBI</a>'s <a href="National%20Crime%20Information%20Center">NCIC criminal database</a>, and DUI arrests and convictions cannot be <a href="expungement%20in%20the%20United%20States">expunged</a>. Statutory <a href="defense%20%28legal%29">criminal defenses</a> (e.g. <a href="duress">duress</a>, <a href="entrapment">entrapment</a>) are not available for DUI, and in "State v. Hammond", the state Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a person who drove after unknowingly having his drink spiked with alcohol. <a href="Common-law">Common-law</a> criminal defenses "are" available in DUI cases, and a <a href="New%20Jersey%20Superior%20Court%2C%20Appellate%20Division">state appellate court</a> reversed the conviction of a person who drove while intoxicated in order to escape assailants, citing the doctrine of <a href="necessity%20%28criminal%20law%29">necessity</a>.

Penalties for DUI vary by level of intoxication and number of previous convictions. A first offense DUI with a BAC level of less than 0.10% faces a fine of $250 to $400, an automobile insurance surcharge of $1000 per year for 3 years, 12 hours of alcohol education, a 3-month license suspension, and imprisonment for up to 30 days (rarely imposed). If the driver's BAC level is 0.10% or greater, the fine increases to $300 to $500, and the license suspension increase to 7 to 12 months. If the driver's BAC level is 0.15% or greater, the driver will be required to have an <a href="ignition%20interlock%20device">ignition interlock device</a> installed in their car for 6 to 12 months after they have their license restored. New Jersey does not have <a href="Administrative%20License%20Revocation">administrative license revocation</a>, and thus a suspected drunk driver's license is not suspended until they are convicted.

A person under 21 who is convicted of driving with a BAC level of at least 0.01%, but less than 0.08% will have their driver's license suspended for 1 to 3 months, be required to perform 15–30 hours of community service, and take part in an alcohol education program. Penalties for refusal to submit a breath sample are the same as driving with a BAC over 0.15%. The holder of a <a href="commercial%20driver%27s%20license">commercial driver's license</a> (CDL) is subject to a one-year suspension of their CDL for the first offense, and a lifetime CDL suspension for repeat offenses if they drive a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% or greater, drive an automobile with a BAC of 0.08% or greater, or refuse to submit a breath sample. More severe penalties may be imposed if the DUI took place within 1000 feet of a school, or if there was a juvenile in the vehicle. DUI accidents resulting in serious injury or death are considered <a href="indictment">indictable</a> crimes.

New Jersey prohibits <a href="plea%20bargaining">plea bargaining</a> in DUI cases unless the prosecutor believes there is insufficient evidence to prove the case, and New Jersey does not offer hardship (work) licenses for people convicted of DUI. Because DUI is not a criminal offense in New Jersey, defendants are ineligible for pretrial intervention (PTI) and other <a href="diversion%20program">diversion program</a>s. A previous DUI conviction, in New Jersey or another state, cannot be used to disqualify a person from such programs, and those charged with an indictable offense stemming from drunk driving (e.g. cases involving serious injuries or eluding arrest) are eligible for PTI. A person convicted of DUI is barred from recovering accident-related damages from other drivers, but may be able to sue the business or person who served them alcoholic beverages.

For a second DUI conviction in a 10-year period, irrespective of BAC, there is a fine of $500–$1,000, 2–90 days imprisonment, a 2-year license suspension, an automobile insurance surcharge of $1,000 a year for 3 years, and installation of an ignition interlock device for 1 to 3 years after license restoration. A person who has 3 or more DUI convictions and a gap of less than 10 years since the last conviction incurs a fine of $1,000, 6 months imprisonment, a 10-year license suspension, an automobile insurance surcharge of $1,500 a year for 3 years, and installation of an ignition interlock device for 1 to 3 years after license restoration. Jail sentences issued in New Jersey for DUI are often served through <a href="work%20release">work release</a> programs (e.g. weekends in jail).

New Jersey first established drunk driving laws in 1909, making it a disorderly persons offense (misdemeanor). In 1921, DUI was converted to a traffic violation with a 1-year license suspension for the first violation, and a 5-year suspension for repeat violations. Penalties were increased in 1926 to a 2-year suspension, and a lifetime suspension and a mandatory 3 months in jail for repeat offenses. In 1951, out of concerns regarding the evidence needed to prove "intoxication", the New Jersey Legislature amended the DUI statute to state that a driver with a BAC of 0.15% or greater was presumed to be intoxicated. A driver with a BAC of 0.15% or greater could be acquitted if they could show that they were not physically <a href="alcohol%20intoxication">intoxicated</a>.

Because of new ideas about the treatment of <a href="alcoholism">alcoholism</a>, the lifetime suspension was downgraded to a 10-year suspension in 1952. DUI prosecutions remained difficult in cases when drivers refused to take a Breathalyzer test, and so in 1966, the state authorized the suspension of a person's driver's license for refusing to submit a breath sample. In 1977, the BAC limit was reduced to 0.10%, but the law was modified to differentiate between the second and third offenses, with lesser penalties for first and second convictions. In 1983, the state established a "<a href="Illegal%20per%20se">per se</a>" rule wherein a person over the limit was considered drunk in all cases (that is, not merely a <a href="presumption">presumption</a>). Nine years later, the 0.01% BAC limit for drivers under 21 was instituted, and in 2003, the 0.10% BAC limit was reduced to 0.08% to comply with federal highway funding requirements.

It is illegal in New Jersey to have an open container of alcohol in the passenger portion of a private automobile, but open bottles of alcohol may be transported in the trunk of a car, and consumption of alcohol on a bus, train, <a href="taxi">taxi</a>, limousine, or boat is permitted. The penalty for having an open container of alcohol in a car is $200 fine for the first offense, and a $250 fine or 10 days of <a href="community%20service%23Alternative%20sentencing">community service</a> for repeat violations. The state <a href="New%20Jersey%20Motor%20Vehicle%20Commission">Motor Vehicle Commission</a> does not impose <a href="point%20system%20%28driving%29">license points</a> for open container convictions, but some <a href="automobile%20insurance">automobile insurance</a> companies impose a <a href="Fee">surcharge</a>. New Jersey's law on open containers in motor vehicles is compliant with the <a href="Transportation%20Equity%20Act%20for%20the%2021st%20Century">Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century</a> (TEA-21), a federal act passed in 1998 which reduces the highway funding of states that do not prohibit open containers in passenger areas of automobiles.

New Jersey's <a href="List%20of%20New%20Jersey%20state%20parks">state parks and forests</a> prohibit the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages except at pre-approved events. There is no state law against public consumption of alcohol in other locations, but most municipalities have <a href="United%20States%20open%20container%20laws">open container laws</a> prohibiting or restricting public consumption. The fine for alcohol possession in a state park is $71, whereas municipal fines for public consumption violations can be as high as $2000, although they are generally much lower. Per the Alcoholism Treatment and Rehabilitation Act (ATRA), <a href="public%20intoxication">public intoxication</a> without accompanying <a href="disorderly%20conduct">disorderly behavior</a> is not a criminal offense, and municipalities are prohibited from making ordinances against public intoxication. New Jersey law allows a police officer to take people found to be intoxicated in public to their residence or to a medical facility.

Unlike many other states, New Jersey imposes no restrictions on the types or quantities of alcoholic beverages that a person of legal age may purchase. <a href="Neutral%20grain%20spirit">Grain alcohol</a>, <a href="Energy%20drinks%23Caffeinated%20alcoholic%20energy%20drinks">caffeinated alcoholic beverages</a>, and <a href="absinthe">absinthe</a> can be legally sold, and state law imposes no limitations on the alcohol content of beer or wine. New Jersey does not require kegs to be <a href="keg%20registration">registered</a>, and state ABC regulations prohibit municipal keg registration laws. A resident can import any amount of alcohol into the state for personal use, but a $50 permit is required if more than 3 gallons of beer, 1 gallon of wine, or a half-gallon of spirits are being imported within a 24-hour period. Any person who is 21 years or older may produce up to 200 gallons of beer or wine per year. No permit is required, but any <a href="homebrewing">brewing</a> or <a href="winemaking">winemaking</a> must take place at a private home or non-commercial property, and any beer and wine produced cannot be sold. It is a criminal offense to possess an unregistered still, or distill any amount of hard liquor.

Bars and restaurants are considered <a href="strict%20liability">strictly liable</a> for their patrons' behavior, and liquor licenses can be suspended or revoked if a customer engages in illegal activity (e.g. fighting, public urination) after drinking. New Jersey law recognizes both <a href="Dram%20shop">dram shop liability</a> and <a href="social%20host%20liability">social host liability</a>, wherein the server of alcohol to visibly intoxicated persons or minors is liable if that person then causes death or injury to a third party in an alcohol-related automobile collision or other accident. In order to mitigate liability, the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) grants licensed establishments the right to exclude any patron for any reason, but warns business against violating <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> laws.

While the courts in New Jersey allow actions based on dram shop liability or social host liability, they will <a href="jury%20instructions">instruct a jury</a> to consider the intoxicated person's negligence under the doctrine of <a href="comparative%20negligence">comparative negligence</a>. Licensed establishments and social hosts may be liable for drunk driving accidents, <a href="assault">assault</a>s, falls, and other injuries and property damage caused by a customer, but are not liable for behavior which is unforeseeable (e.g. falling out of a tree), nor are they liable if they only served food or non-alcoholic beverages to a drunk patron. Dram shop and social host litigation may involve both <a href="damages%23Compensatory%20or%20expectation%20damages">compensatory</a> and <a href="punitive%20damages">punitive damages</a>. There is a 2-year statute of limitations for such <a href="lawsuit">lawsuit</a>s, but the time limit may be extended if the victim is a juvenile.

Social hosts are given more liability protection than licensed businesses in that a private person is generally only liable for the actions of guests over 21 if their blood alcohol content is above 0.15, and the lawsuit involves drunk driving injuries. As long as a guest is not underage, a social host has no liability for assaults, falls, and other non-DUI injuries. Although most alcohol-related lawsuits involve parties injured by drunk drivers, there have been cases in New Jersey where drunk drivers were able to successfully sue the establishment that served them. Recently, in "Voss v. Tranquillino" the New Jersey courts held that a drunk driver can sue a bar or restaurant under the "Dram Shop Act" and prevail under the theory that:

[a] person who sustains personal injury or property damage as a result of the negligent service of alcoholic beverages by a licensed alcoholic beverage server may recover damages from a licensed alcoholic beverage server if the server was negligent (i.e. served a visibly intoxicated person), the injury was proximately caused by the negligent service of alcoholic beverages, and the injury was a foreseeable consequence of the negligent service.
In 1959, the New Jersey Supreme Court permitted a lawsuit against several taverns that had served alcohol to an underage person, who then caused a fatal automobile accident. The court stated that its decision was based on the fact that this conduct was already illegal under ABC regulations, stating that, "We are convinced that recognition of the plaintiff's claim will afford a fairer measure of justice to innocent third parties whose injuries are brought about by the unlawful and negligent sale of alcoholic beverages to minors and intoxicated persons." New Jersey courts have expanded the dram shop doctrine to include social hosts who serve alcoholic beverages to guests, and automobile owners who allow drunk drivers to operate their cars.

Because of complaints from bar owners about their inability to obtain liability insurance, the state passed legislation in 1987 to limit liability to cases where the server could have realistically known that the patron was underage or intoxicated, and to limit lawsuits to types of injuries that are foreseeable. The act also instituted the legal standard of comparative negligence in these cases, wherein the monetary damages against a licensed establishment can be reduced if there are others who are also <a href="negligent">negligent</a> (e.g. the patron, other bars). Additional legislation passed in 1987 substantially limited the liability of social hosts for adult guests.

New Jersey's criminal code prohibits voluntary intoxication from being used directly as a defense to a crime, though if a crime requires that the conduct was committed <a href="intention%20%28criminal%20law%29">intentionally</a>, intoxication may prevent the person from having the necessary "<a href="mens%20rea">mens rea</a>" to be guilty. For example, a person accused of killing a person during a fight while drunk may not be guilty of <a href="murder">murder</a> because New Jersey law requires that the actor <a href="intention%20%28criminal%20law%29%23Purpose%20intent%20and%20knowledge%20intent">purposely or knowingly</a> "causes death or serious bodily injury resulting in death." In such a case, an accused killer could be found guilty of <a href="manslaughter">manslaughter</a>, which only requires reckless conduct, including acts committed while intoxicated.

Involuntary and pathological intoxication are <a href="affirmative%20defenses">affirmative defenses</a> to all criminal offenses in New Jersey, but are not defenses to regulatory law and traffic law offenses that are considered <a href="strict%20liability%20%28criminal%29">strict liability</a> violations (e.g. environmental regulations, DUI). Involuntary intoxication relates to cases where someone did not know that they had consumed alcohol (e.g. a spiked drink). Pathological intoxication is applicable where, for medical reasons, a person had an exaggerated response to alcohol. To be used as a defense, the person being charged must show that "at the time of his conduct did not know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong." <a href="Contract">Contract</a>s made with an intoxicated person may be voided by courts if "the defendant was so intoxicated" that he or she "could not realize and appreciate the nature and consequences of what defendant was doing."

In 1976, the New Jersey legislature passed the Alcoholism Treatment and Rehabilitation Act (ATRA), which declared that the <a href="public%20policy%20doctrine">public policy</a> of New Jersey was that "alcoholics and intoxicated persons may not be subjected to criminal prosecution because of their consumption of alcoholic beverages, but rather should be afforded a continuum of treatment in order that they may lead normal lives as productive members of society." Since the implementation of ATRA, it has been the general policy of New Jersey to treat alcoholism as a <a href="disease%20model%20of%20addiction">disease</a>. Under ATRA, an intoxicated person arrested for a non-indictable criminal offense may be taken to a medical facility, instead of <a href="jail">jail</a>, and will be released as soon as they are <a href="sobriety">sober</a>, or at most 48 hours.

Likewise a person charged with a non-indictable criminal offense, including those being adjudicated in <a href="juvenile%20court">juvenile court</a>, may request alcohol treatment in lieu of criminal prosecution. If a <a href="physician">physician</a> attests that the <a href="defendant">defendant</a> is an alcoholic, the court may impose inpatient treatment for up to 30 days, outpatient treatment for up to 60 days, or both. If the person successfully completes the treatment program, the criminal charges will be dismissed. A person with <a href="alcohol%20dependence">alcohol dependency</a> who has been charged with an indictable crime may apply for "special probation" (also known as <a href="Drug%20courts%20in%20the%20United%20States">drug court</a>). Those charged with severe violent crimes (e.g. murder, <a href="kidnapping">kidnapping</a>) are not eligible, but people charged with offenses with <a href="mandatory%20sentence">mandatory sentence</a>s, or who have extensive non-violent criminal records may be eligible. If admitted to special probation, the defendant will be subject to 18 months to 5 years of intense probation and <a href="residential%20treatment%20center">residential treatment</a> as an <a href="alternatives%20to%20incarceration">alternative to prison</a>.

An employer who <a href="dismissal%20%28employment%29">terminates</a> an employee for being an alcoholic is in violation of the state's anti-discrimination laws unless they can show that person's condition affected their job performance or created a substantial safety risk. No <a href="Hospital%23Types">general hospitals</a> may refuse a patient treatment for intoxication or alcoholism, and all <a href="Individually%20purchased%20health%20insurance%20in%20the%20United%20States">individual</a> and <a href="group%20insurance">group</a> <a href="health%20insurance%20in%20the%20United%20States">health insurance</a> plans which are regulated by the state of New Jersey are required to offer both inpatient and outpatient treatment for alcoholism. Under federal law, all group health insurances plans for private companies with more than 50 employees must offer insurance coverage for alcoholism that is equal to their insurance coverage for other medical conditions.

In a 1976 referendum, New Jersey voters approved casino gambling in Atlantic City. Because of concerns about <a href="organized%20crime">organized crime</a> connections to gambling, New Jersey enacted strict regulations that included <a href="Gaming%20control%20board%23Licensing">licensing</a> of all casino employees and contractors, and a <a href="separation%20of%20powers">separation of powers</a> between the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) and the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Casino%20Control%20Commission">Casino Control Commission</a> (CCC). The Division of Gaming Enforcement is part of the New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety, and is responsible for investigating casino license applications, monitoring casino operations, and enforcing New Jersey's casino laws and regulations as defined in Title 5, Chapter 12 of New Jersey's statutes, and Title 13, Chapter 69I of New Jersey's Administrative Code. The Casino Control Commission is an <a href="independent%20agency">independent agency</a> in the state <a href="New%20Jersey%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Department</a> with both <a href="quasi-legislative%20capacity">quasi-legislative</a> and <a href="quasi-judicial%20body">quasi-judicial</a> powers, and is responsible for creating casino regulations, hearing appeals of DGE penalties, and make decisions on casino licensing. In light of such regulation and the uniqueness of casino gambling, New Jersey's twelve casinos are not under the jurisdiction of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) or Atlantic City's alcoholic beverage control board.

Casinos, and vendors serving, selling or storing alcoholic beverages for a casino, are required to obtain a casino hotel alcoholic beverage (CHAB) license from the Division of Gaming Enforcement. CHAB licenses must be renewed every five years. New Jersey's casino alcohol regulations are divided into five different regions of activity: (a) the casino floor (includes <a href="simulcast">simulcast</a>ing facilities); (b) the hotel (includes restaurants and meeting rooms); (c) package goods; (d) room service; and (e) storage. Alcohol sold or given away on the casino floor and in hotel areas must be in an open container for immediate consumption, whereas alcohol sold in a package goods area must be sealed. Alcoholic beverages brought to a patron as a <a href="room%20service">room service</a> may be open or closed, whereas storage areas must not be accessible to the public.

Although casinos are not under the jurisdiction of the ABC, many of the regulations for casinos and casino vendors are similar to those for ABC class C retailer licensees. Casinos may generally only purchase alcoholic beverages from licensed wholesalers (i.e. ABC Class B licensees). A casino may have a brewpub on site, but production is limited to 3,000 barrels of beer per year, and the beer may only be distributed in open containers on casino floor and in hotel areas of the casino. Casinos may obtain a permit to have tastings, and tasting dinners. Non-profit organizations may obtain a permit to have a social event at a casino where they charge for alcoholic beverages. Organizations are limited to 12 casino social event permits per year, and a given casino may only host 25 such events per year.

Casinos are not allowed to serve alcohol to people who are under 21 or intoxicated, are strictly liable for patron's behavior, and are subject to dram shop lawsuits for injuries stemming from negligence in serving alcohol. Casinos are permitted to give away <a href="Comps%20%28casino%29">"comp"</a> drinks, and many do to reward and encourage gambling. Except on New Year's Eve, a casino cannot sell an unlimited amount of alcoholic beverages at a set price, nor may they require patrons to purchase alcoholic beverages in order to access an event or service. In 1983, because of difficulties in preventing underage drinking in casinos, the legal age to gamble at a casino was raised to 21. In "Hakimoglu v. Trump Taj Mahal Associates", a federal appeals court decided that casinos are not legally responsible for gambling losses and debts incurred by intoxicated gamblers, but it is not clear if the decision applies if the intoxicated gambler is also underage.

Because they serve alcoholic beverages, casino nightclubs are prohibited from offering full nudity. In 2013, <a href="Trump%20Taj%20Mahal">Trump Taj Mahal</a> opened the nation's first casino strip club, featuring scantily clad dancers. New Jersey's casinos initially had closing times like most ABC-licensed establishments, but were allowed to stay open 24 hours per day, 7 days a week starting in 1992 It is legal for a minor to go to a casino, insofar as they do not gamble, consume alcoholic beverages in public areas of the casino, or remain on the gambling floor. Because Atlantic City has ordinances prohibiting underage drinking on private property, it is illegal for a person underage 21 to drink in a casino hotel room unless a family member is present.

The applicability of state and municipal alcohol laws on federal lands is a complex and partially unresolved legal issue that depends on whether the federal property is considered a <a href="federal%20enclave">federal enclave</a>, what rights the state reserved when it granted the property to the federal government, and whether the law is <a href="criminal%20law">criminal</a> or <a href="civil%20law%20%28common%20law%29">civil</a>. If the federal property is not an enclave, the federal government either has <a href="concurrent%20jurisdiction">concurrent jurisdiction</a> (shared authority with the state) or <a href="federal%20jurisdiction%20%28United%20States%29">proprietary jurisdiction</a> (only the rights of a landowner), and the state can enforce alcohol laws.

If the federal property is an enclave, then the federal government has <a href="exclusive%20jurisdiction">exclusive jurisdiction</a>, unless the state reserved rights when it <a href="cession">ceded</a> the land to the federal government. The <a href="Assimilative%20Crimes%20Act">Assimilative Crimes Act</a> makes it a federal crime to violate a state law while at a federal enclave in that state. The Assimilative Crimes Act only applies to criminal laws (not regulatory laws), and is not applicable if the conduct is already regulated by federal law. Under federal law, military facilities are required to adopt state traffic laws, but the <a href="base%20commander">base commander</a> is permitted to institute additional traffic laws.

In New Jersey, older <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Department of Defense</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Interior">Department of Interior</a> properties such as <a href="Fort%20Dix">Fort Dix</a> and parts of <a href="Sandy%20Hook">Sandy Hook</a> are federal enclaves, but most other federal properties are not enclaves. Because New Jersey generally did not reserve any right to regulate federal enclaves, state liquor licensing rules and alcohol taxes cannot be enforced. There is no universal policy regarding the sale of alcoholic beverages on federal lands, but almost all military bases, and some <a href="National%20Park%20Service">national parks</a> allow for alcohol concessions, both for on-premises or off-premises consumption.

Unlike the state, federal agencies which allow alcohol sales do not have a system of liquor licenses or alcoholic beverage control boards, but instead simply award contracts to business per <a href="Government%20procurement%20in%20the%20United%20States">federal procurement laws</a>. New Jersey does not consider municipal ordinances to be criminal offenses, and so open container laws cannot be enforced in federal enclaves under the Assimilative Crimes Act. Public consumption of alcohol is allowed on federal lands, except when in an automobile, or when the park superintendent has prohibited open containers in an area. For example, it is legal to consume alcoholic beverages on the beach at <a href="Sandy%20Hook">Sandy Hook</a>.

Because DUI in New Jersey is a non-criminal traffic violation, state DUI laws are not subject to the Assimilative Crimes Act. Members of the <a href="United%20States%20Armed%20Forces">Armed Forces</a> can be <a href="court%20martial">court martial</a>ed for drunk driving, military bases can enforce New Jersey traffic law on civilians, and it is a <a href="misdemeanor">misdemeanor</a> under federal law to drive while intoxicated on land administered by the National Park Service, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Veterans%20Affairs">Department of Veterans Affairs</a>, or the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">Postal Service</a>. Similar to New Jersey, federal DUI statutes prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while having a BAC of 0.08% or greater, and require a driver to give a breath sample if requested by a <a href="law%20enforcement">law enforcement</a> authority.

Federal DUI law differs from New Jersey law in that there are no <a href="mandatory%20minimum">mandatory minimum</a> jail sentences, irrespective of the number of previous DUI convictions, and plea bargaining is allowed. A federal DUI conviction will result in <a href="expungement">unexpungeable</a> criminal record. Federal courts cannot suspend a driver's license, but may notify the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission of a DUI conviction. In federal enclaves that are under the jurisdiction of other federal departments (e.g. <a href="Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">Fish and Wildlife Service</a>), it is unclear if drunk driving could be prosecuted since the Assimilative Crimes Act is inapplicable, and there is no federal law defining DUI on those properties.

Under federal law, the drinking age for the Armed Forces is the same as the state or nation where the military base is located, or the drinking age of a state or nation within 50 miles of the base. Effectively, that restricts the purchase of alcohol at New Jersey military bases to those over 21. Irrespective of state laws on underage consumption, the <a href="United%20States%20Army">Army</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Navy">Navy</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">Air Force</a>, and <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">Coast Guard</a> prohibit the consumption of alcohol by underage personnel when stationed in the United States. <a href="United%20States%20Marines">Marines</a> under 21 are permitted to drink alcohol at U.S. bases on special occasions.

Federal law states that national parks will have the same underage laws as the state that they are located in, and the Assimilative Crimes Act is applicable to New Jersey's underage drinking statute. Thus, in a private location, such as a cabin in a federal enclave in New Jersey, a parent can serve alcohol to their child, and an underage person can possess and consume alcohol. Outside of these exceptions, underage drinking and serving alcohol to a minor are federal misdemeanors, punishable by a fine and up to 6 months in jail. There is a five-year statute of limitations for DUI, underage drinking, and other alcohol violations that take place in federal enclaves.

Miss Meyers

Miss Meyers (1949 – March 1963) was an <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse">American Quarter Horse</a> racehorse and <a href="mare">broodmare</a>, the 1953 World Champion Quarter Running Horse. She won $28,725 (equivalent to about $ as of ) as well as 17 races. As a broodmare, she produced, or was the mother of, the first <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association">American Quarter Horse Association</a> (AQHA) Supreme Champion, Kid Meyers. She was the mother of three other <a href="foal">foal</a>s, and was inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame in 2009.

Miss Meyers was a <a href="Chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnut</a>-colored <a href="mare">mare</a> born in 1949 and sired, or fathered, by <a href="Leo%20%28horse%29">Leo</a>, a member of the AQHA Hall of Fame. Miss Meyers' dam, or mother, was Star's Lou. Star's Lou's father was <a href="Oklahoma%20Star">Oklahoma Star P-6</a>, another AQHA Hall of Fame member. She was bred by O. C. Meyer, and later owned by Bruce A. Green.

Miss Meyers raced from 1952 until 1955 and won seven <a href="stakes%20race">stakes race</a>s, placing second in seven others, and third in two more. She won 17 of her 59 starts on the racetrack. She placed second in another 15 races and third in 5. Her total earnings on the track were $28,727 (approximately $ in dollars). Among her wins in stakes races were the 1952 Buttons and Bows Stakes, the 1953 California Championship, the 1953 Billy Anson Stakes, the 1953 Rocky Mountain Quarter Horse Association World Championship Dash, the 1955 Bart B Stakes, the 1955 Barbara B Stakes and the 1955 Traveler Stakes. She set four track records, twice at , once at , and once at . In 1953 she was named the AQHA World Champion Quarter Running Horse, as well as the High Money Earning Horse; the AQHA also awarded her the title of <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association%23Racing">Superior Race Horse</a> in 1954. The highest <a href="speed%20index">speed index</a> she achieved, a measure of how fast she was able to run, during her racing career was AAAT, the highest possible at the time. It was not until she was a four-year-old, during 1953, that Miss Meyers performed well and started winning on the track. That year she won $15,398 (approximately $ in ) dollars, over half her lifetime earnings, as well as seven of her seventeen career wins.

After Miss Meyers retired from the racetrack, she became the dam of the first <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association%23Lifetime%20awards">AQHA Supreme Champion</a>, Kid Meyers, sired by fellow Hall of Famer <a href="Three%20Bars">Three Bars</a>, a Thoroughbred. (A Supreme Champion is a horse that is outstanding on the racetrack, as a riding horse at <a href="horse%20show">horse show</a>s and also conformationally, or how well put together the horse is). Kid Meyers was a 1963 <a href="Sorrel%20%28horse%29">sorrel</a> <a href="stallion">stallion</a>, and had 23 starts on the racetrack, winning 6 times. He earned a total of $10,655 (approximately $ as of dollars) on the track. After retiring from the racetrack, he earned his <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association%23Lifetime%20awards">AQHA Champion</a> in 1966 and his AQHA Supreme Champion in 1967. His highest speed index was AAA. Unlike most foals, who nurse for months after birth, Kid Meyers was orphaned at the age of one month in March 1963.

Miss Meyers had three other foals. Oh My Oh, a 1957 <a href="Bay%20%28horse%29">bay</a> mare sired by the Thoroughbred stallion Spotted Bull, started 30 times, winning eight races for a total earnings of $12,592 (approximately $ as of dollars) and coming in second in a stakes race. She earned an AAAT speed index. As a broodmare, she was the dam of <a href="All%20American%20Futurity">All American Futurity</a> winner Three Oh's. Miss Meyers' 1958 foal was Mr Meyers, a sorrel stallion sired by fellow Hall of Famer <a href="Go%20Man%20Go">Go Man Go</a>, who started 41 times, winning 9 times and placing third in four stakes races. His total race earnings were $25,656 (approximately $ as of dollars). He went on to earn an AQHA Champion title along with a Superior Race Horse award, to go with his AAAT speed index. Mr Meyers became a successful breeding stallion. Miss Meyers' fourth foal was a 1959 chestnut mare named Milpool sired by Vandy. Milpool was never raced or entered in a <a href="horse%20show">horse show</a>.

Miss Meyers died in March 1963, shortly after having Kid Meyers. She was inducted into the AQHA's <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Hall%20of%20Fame">American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame</a> in 2009.

<doc id="22845293" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22845293" title="SR Merchant Navy class">
SR Merchant Navy class

The SR Merchant Navy class (originally known as the 21C1 class, and later informally known as Bulleid Pacifics, Spam Cans or Packets) is a class of <a href="streamliner">air-smoothed</a> <a href="4-6-2">4-6-2 Pacific</a> <a href="steam%20locomotive">steam locomotive</a>s designed for the <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28UK%29">Southern Railway</a> by <a href="Oliver%20Bulleid">Oliver Bulleid</a>. The Pacific design was chosen in preference to several others proposed by Bulleid. The first members of the class were constructed during the Second World War, and the last of the 30 locomotives in 1949.

Incorporating a number of new developments in British steam locomotive technology, the design of the Merchant Navy class was among the first to use <a href="welding">welding</a> in the construction process; this enabled easier fabrication of components during the austerity of the war and post-war economies. In addition the locomotives featured <a href="thermic%20syphons">thermic syphons</a> in their boilers and the controversial <a href="Bulleid%20chain-driven%20valve%20gear">Bulleid chain-driven valve gear</a>. The class members were named after the <a href="British%20Merchant%20Navy">Merchant Navy</a> shipping lines involved in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Battle of the Atlantic</a>, and latterly those which used <a href="Southampton%20Docks">Southampton Docks</a>, a publicity masterstroke by the Southern Railway, which operated Southampton Docks during the period.

Due to problems with some of the more novel features of Bulleid's design, all members of the class were modified by <a href="British%20Railways">British Railways</a> during the late 1950s, losing their air-smoothed casings in the process. The Merchant Navy class operated until the end of Southern steam in July 1967. A third of the class has survived and can be seen on <a href="heritage%20railway">heritage railway</a>s throughout Great Britain.

The Southern Railway was the most financially successful of the "<a href="Big%20Four%20British%20railway%20companies">Big Four</a>", but this was largely based on investment in suburban and main line <a href="Railway%20electrification%20in%20Great%20Britain">electrification</a>. After the successful introduction of the <a href="SR%20Schools%20class">SR Schools class</a> in 1930, the railway had lagged behind the others in terms of modernising its ageing fleet of steam locomotives. Following the retirement of the General Manager of the Southern Railway <a href="Herbert%20Ashcombe%20Walker">Sir Herbert Walker</a> and <a href="Richard%20Maunsell">Richard Maunsell</a> the <a href="Chief%20Mechanical%20Engineer">Chief Mechanical Engineer</a> (CME) in 1937, their successors considered that the time had come to change this situation. In March 1938, the new General Manager <a href="Gilbert%20Szlumper">Gilbert Szlumper</a> authorised Oliver Bulleid, Maunsell's replacement, to prepare designs for twenty express passenger locomotives. The deteriorating international situation prior to the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> was an additional factor in this decision.

Bulleid's first suggestion was for an eight-coupled locomotive with a <a href="4-8-2">4-8-2</a> wheel arrangement for the heavily loaded <a href="Golden%20Arrow%20%28train%29">Golden Arrow</a> and <a href="Night%20Ferry">Night Ferry</a> Continental express trains, although this was quickly modified to a <a href="2-8-2">2-8-2</a> equipped with a Helmholtz "<a href="Bissel%20bogie">Bissel bogie</a>" – a system already successfully applied on the <a href="Continental%20Europe">Continent</a>. However, both proposals for eight-coupled locomotives were resisted by the Southern Railway's Chief Civil Engineer, so a new 4-6-2 Pacific design was settled upon instead. The new design was intended for express <a href="passenger">passenger</a> and semi-fast work in <a href="Southern%20England">Southern England</a>, though it had to be equally adept at <a href="freight">freight</a> workings due to the nominal <a href="mixed-traffic%20locomotive">"mixed traffic"</a> classification Bulleid applied to the class for them to be built during wartime. Administrative measures had been put in place by the wartime government, preventing the construction of express passenger locomotives, due to shortages of materials and a need for locomotives with freight-hauling capabilities. Classifying a design as "mixed traffic" neatly circumvented this restriction.

Most of the detailed design for the Merchant Navy class was undertaken by the drawing office at <a href="Brighton%20railway%20works">Brighton works</a>, but some work was also undertaken by <a href="Ashford%20railway%20works">Ashford</a> and <a href="Eastleigh%20Works">Eastleigh</a>. This division of responsibility was possibly due to Bulleid's wish to restrict knowledge of the new class to a limited number of personnel. The design incorporated a number of novel features, compared to then-current steam locomotive practice in <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>.

Three diameter cylinders drove the centre coupled axle. The inside cylinder was steeply inclined at 1:7.5 but the outside cylinders were horizontal.

It was originally intended to use a gear-driven <a href="valve%20gear">valve gear</a>, but space restrictions within the <a href="locomotive%20frame">frames</a> and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel <a href="Bulleid%20chain-driven%20valve%20gear">chain-driven valve gear</a>. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, because it could cause highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid <a href="steam%20reverser">steam reverser</a>. The entire system was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.

The locomotives were equipped with the unusual 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) <a href="Bulleid%20Firth%20Brown">Bulleid Firth Brown</a> (BFB) driving wheels which were lighter, yet stronger than the spoked equivalent. These proved to be successful and were later used on other Bulleid classes. The leading <a href="bogie">bogie</a> was based upon that of the <a href="SR%20Lord%20Nelson%20class">SR Lord Nelson class</a>, although it had a 6 ft 3 in (1.90 m) <a href="wheelbase">wheelbase</a> as opposed to Maunsell's 7 ft 6 in (2.28 m) design, and featured 3 ft 1 in (0.94 m) BFB wheels. A long coupled driving wheelbase was incorporated into the design, to keep the locomotives within the lineal loading of the Southern Railway's narrower bridges. The supporting rear trailing truck was a one-piece steel casting that gave the smoothest of rides; the design was utilised in the future <a href="BR%20Standard%20Class%207">BR Standard Class 7</a>.
The spaces between driving wheels housed steam-powered clasp brakes, that gripped the wheels by way of a "scissor" action. The two middle brake hangers held two brake blocks each, whilst the two outside hanger on the leading and rear driving wheels held one block each. These were connected together by outside rodding for ease of access, and the whole system was operated from the footplate.

The maximum boiler pressure was higher than any other British regular service locomotive (except the <a href="GWR%201000%20Class">GWR County class</a>) at 280 <a href="Pounds%20per%20square%20inch">psi</a>.

Bulleid decided on cheaper all-welded fireboxes for the boilers as opposed to more common riveted construction, and a steel inner firebox which was lighter than a more usual copper example. Two welded steel <a href="thermic%20syphon">thermic syphon</a>s were implemented to improve water circulation around the firebox and these were subcontracted to <a href="Beyer%20Peacock">Beyer Peacock</a>.

However he soon discovered that the Southern Railway lacked the facilities to manufacture welded boilers of this size, so the first ten boilers were ordered on outside contract from the <a href="North%20British%20Locomotive%20Company">North British Locomotive Company</a>.

The boiler was enveloped by Bulleid's air-smoothed sheet-steel casing, which was not for the purposes of streamlining, as demonstrated by the extremely flat front end, but as a way of lifting exhaust gases. The flat sides were also an aid to cleaning the locomotive with mechanical carriage washers, representing an attempt to reduce labour costs. It followed the profile of the Belpaire firebox and extended to a curved profile forward of the <a href="smokebox">smokebox</a> front. Spun glass mattresses were used for boiler lagging. The smokebox was a sheet metal fabrication to the same profile as the firebox, acting as a former to maintain the shape of the air-smoothed casing. In between, the casing was supported by channel-section steel crinolines (strengtheners used to maintain the shape) attached to the frames. The smokebox housed the five-nozzle <a href="Jean%20Lema%C3%AEtre">Lemaître</a> <a href="blastpipe">blastpipe</a> arranged in a circle within a large-diameter chimney.

Bulleid designed a new <a href="tender%20locomotive">tender</a> which could carry 5 tons (5.1 t) of coal on a six-wheel chassis. It featured BFB wheels and <a href="streamliner">streamlined panels</a>, or "raves", that gave the top of the tender a similar cross-sectional outline to the <a href="carriage">carriage</a>s hauled by the locomotive. The water tank was of welded sheet construction to save weight, and the tender was fitted with vacuum braking equipment of a clasp-type similar to that used on the locomotive. Three train-brake vacuum reservoirs of cylindrical construction were grouped on the tank top, behind the coal space. Unusually for a British locomotive, two extra water filler caps were incorporated into the tender front, for access from the footplate. The original tender design proved to be inadequately braced and subject to serious leakage if even slightly damaged, or when water surges caused the welded joints to split. The problem was not solved until 1944 when additional baffling was fitted.

<a href="Electric">Electric</a> lighting was also provided on both the locomotive and the <a href="footplate">footplate</a>, supplied by a steam-powered generator fitted below the footplate. The gauges were lit by <a href="ultra-violet%20light">ultra-violet light</a>. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam pressure gauge and the brake pipe vacuum gauge, whilst eliminating dazzle, making it easier for the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was also paid to the <a href="ergonomics">ergonomics</a> of the driving cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both fireman and driver, thus promoting safe operation. As an aid to the <a href="Fireman%20%28locomotive%29">fireman</a>, a steam-operated treadle was provided that used steam <a href="pressure">pressure</a> to open the firehole doors (where the coal is shovelled into the <a href="firebox%20%28steam%20engine%29">firebox</a>). The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter.

The Southern Railway placed an order for ten of the new locomotives to be built at <a href="Eastleigh%20Works">Eastleigh Works</a>, although the boilers had to be supplied from private industry and the <a href="Tender%20%28rail%29">tenders</a> were built at Ashford. The prototype was completed in February 1941, numbered 21C1, and named "Channel Packet" at a ceremony at Eastleigh works on 10 March 1941. It underwent extensive trials and minor modifications before joining Southern Railway stock 4 June 1941. A second prototype, 21C2 "Union Castle" was completed in June and named at <a href="London%20Victoria%20station">Victoria railway station</a> 4 July. Both prototypes were found to be seven tons over the specified weight, and, at the insistence of the Southern Railway <a href="Civil%20Engineer">Civil Engineer</a>, production of the remainder was halted until steps were taken to remedy this. This was achieved by using thinner steel plates for the <a href="Locomotive%20frame">frame</a> stretchers and covering the <a href="Fire-tube%20boiler">boiler</a> cladding, and enlarging the existing <a href="lightening%20holes">lightening holes</a> in the main frames. The remaining eight locomotives in the batch were delivered between September 1941 and July 1942.

A second batch of ten followed, beginning in December 1944 and culminating in June 1945. These were entirely constructed at Eastleigh and equipped with <a href="tender%20locomotive">tenders</a>. The Merchant Navy class spawned the design and construction of a lighter version of the same locomotive with consequently increased <a href="route%20availability">route availability</a>. These were the <a href="SR%20West%20Country%20and%20Battle%20of%20Britain%20classes">West Country and Battle of Britain class</a> "Light Pacifics", the first of which entered service in 1945.

Just prior to the <a href="nationalisation">nationalisation</a> of the railways in 1948, the Southern Railway placed an order for ten more Merchant Navy locomotives, with larger <a href="tender%20locomotive">tenders</a>. A shortage of materials meant that delivery was delayed until September 1948, and completed in 1949; the batch never carried Southern Railway numbers. <a href="Eastleigh%20railway%20works">Eastleigh</a> was responsible for the construction of the final batch, which were in the series 35021–35030. Construction was undertaken in-house by Eastleigh works, with the boilers and tenders constructed at <a href="Brighton%20railway%20works">Brighton</a>, the frames at <a href="Ashford%20railway%20works">Ashford</a> and the rest at Eastleigh. These were equipped with wedge-shaped cab fronts from the outset, and greater use of welding ensured lighter locomotives. The batch was also fitted with the <a href="TIA%20%28water%20treatment%29">TIA</a> ("Traitement Integral Armand") chemical feed-water equipment used on the "Light Pacifics". This precipitated scale-forming constituents in the "hard-water" of southern England into a non-adhesive mud that could be cleared from the locomotive using a manual "blow-down" valve. A delay in the construction of the new larger tenders for the new locomotives meant that some were fitted with the smaller examples intended for use with "Light Pacifics" that were under construction at the time. Two spare boilers for the class were also constructed at Brighton and Eastleigh during 1950/1.

Bulleid adopted a new numbering scheme for all his locomotives based on <a href="Europe">Continental</a> practice, following his experiences at the French branch of <a href="Westinghouse%20Electric">Westinghouse Electric</a> before the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, and those of his tenure in the rail operating department during that conflict. The Southern Railway numbers followed an adaptation of the <a href="UIC%20classification%20of%20locomotive%20axle%20arrangements">UIC classification</a> system of using letters and numbers to designate the powered and unpowered axles, together with a running number. Thus the first <a href="4-6-2">4-6-2</a> locomotive became "21C1" – where "2" and "1" refer to the number of unpowered leading and trailing axles respectively, and "C" refers to the number of driving axles, in this case three. The remainder were numbered 21C2-21C19. The scheme was abandoned by <a href="British%20Railways">British Railways</a> in 1949 and the existing locomotives were renumbered under the British Railways standard system in the series 35001-35019; the final batch appeared in traffic as 35020-35029.

The Southern Railway considered naming the locomotives after victories of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, to the extent that a mocked-up nameplate "<a href="Battle%20of%20the%20River%20Plate">River Plate</a>" was produced. In the event, when early successes for the British proved few and far between, the chairman of the <a href="Union%20Castle%20Line">Union Castle Line</a> suggested naming them after shipping companies which had called at <a href="Southampton%20Docks">Southampton Docks</a> in peacetime. This idea resonated in 1941 because the shipping lines were heavily involved in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Atlantic convoys</a> to and from <a href="United%20Kingdom">Britain</a> during the Second World War.

A new design of nameplate was created, featuring a circular plate with a smaller circle in the centre. The inner circle carried the colours of the shipping company on a stylised flag, on an <a href="air%20force%20blue">air force blue</a> background. Around the outer circle was the name of the locomotive, picked out in <a href="gilding">gilt</a> lettering. A horizontal rectangular plate was attached to either side of the circular nameplate, with "Merchant Navy Class" in gilt lettering. This acted as a class plate, as indicated on the nameplate photograph, above left.

During their operational career, the class gained several nicknames; the most obvious, "Bulleid Pacific", simply denoted the designer and wheel arrangement. The colloquial name "Spam Can" arose from their utilitarian appearance, enhanced by the flat, boxy air-smoothed casing, and the resemblance of this to the distinctive <a href="tin%20can">tin can</a>s in which <a href="Spam%20%28food%29">SPAM</a> was sold. The nickname "Packets" was also adopted by locomotive drivers, as the first member of the class was named "Channel Packet".

As the class appeared during the War, there were no heavily laden Continental Boat Trains from <a href="Dover">Dover</a> and <a href="Folkestone">Folkestone</a>, for which they had been designed. They were, however, used on express trains on the <a href="South%20Western%20Main%20Line">South Western Main Line</a> to <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> and to <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a> . In August 1945, a series of test runs were made between <a href="London%20Victoria%20station">London Victoria</a> and <a href="Dover%20Marine%20railway%20station">Dover</a> and from October the class were used on the resumed Continental expresses. The prestigious <a href="Bournemouth%20Belle">Bournemouth Belle</a> <a href="Pullman%20%28car%20or%20coach%29">Pullman</a> train was reinstated in October 1946 and entrusted to the class for the next two decades. However, their heavy axle loading and length meant that they were banned from many areas of the Southern Railway, and, later, the British Railways <a href="Southern%20Region%20of%20British%20Railways">Southern Region</a> network.

As mentioned, the main production batch of Southern-built locomotives differed from the two prototypes, "Channel Packet" and "Union Castle". The steam-operated firehole door treadle was removed, and a new type of boiler cladding was utilised in response to the worsening supply situation during the Second World War. Modification was also made to the air-smoothed casing surrounding the smokebox after reports were made of drifting smoke obscuring the locomotive crew's vision ahead. Initially, the only form of smoke deflection was a narrow slot in front of the chimney, intended to enable air to lift the smoke when the locomotive was travelling. This proved inadequate because of the relatively soft exhaust blast that came from the multiple-jet <a href="blastpipe">blastpipe</a>, which failed to be caught by the air flow. After several trials, the air flow was increased by extending the casing roof over the front of the smokebox to form a cowling whilst side smoke deflector plates were also incorporated into the front of the air-smoothed casing. The latter added to the poor visibility from the footplate and the expedients combined never fully solved the smoke drift problem.
During the time they operated under the Southern Railway, further modifications were applied to the class, such as the reduction in boiler pressure to and the redesign of the footplate <a href="spectacle%20plate">spectacle plate</a>s. These are the small <a href="window">window</a>s on the front face of the cab, which were redesigned to a wedge-shaped profile, a feature to be seen on all Bulleid-designed locomotives post-nationalisation. They had been introduced in Britain in 1934 with the <a href="Nigel%20Gresley">Gresley</a>-designed "<a href="LNER%20Class%20P2">Cock o' the North</a>". Originally, the spectacle plates of the Bulleid Pacifics were at the conventional right-angle to the direction of the locomotive, and offered limited vision ahead along the air-smoothed casing. The Southern-built batches also had variations in the material used for the air-smoothed casing with a change from sheet steel to an <a href="asbestos">asbestos</a> compound, forced upon the manufacturer by wartime expediency. This resulted in several class members having a horizontal strengthening rib running down the length of the casing. The final Southern Railway-initiated experiment involved equipping 21C5 "Canadian Pacific" with a Berkeley mechanical stoker imported from <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. Little improvement in performance was seen when trialled under British Railways auspices in 1948 and the locomotive was re-converted to hand-firing.

As mentioned, the British Railways batch had detail differences to previous versions. The most significant modification was the reduction of weight using lighter materials unavailable during wartime. From 1952 the air-smoothed casing ahead of the cylinders was removed to ease maintenance and lubrication. This coincided with the removal of the tender 'raves' on all locomotives, as they quickly rotted, obstructed the packing of coal into the bunker and restricted the driver's view when reversing the locomotive. The resultant 'cut-down' tender included new, enclosed storage for fire-irons, revised step ladders and glass spectacle plates to protect the crew from flying coal dust when running tender-first.

The new locomotives demonstrated that they could generate enormous power using mediocre quality fuel, due largely to Bulleid's excellent boiler. They also ran very smoothly at high speed. Partly as a result of having so many novel features, the first few years of service by the Merchant Navy class were beset by a variety of technical problems. Some of these were merely "teething troubles", but others remained with the class throughout their working lives. These may be summarised as follows:

As a result of these problems, in 1954 serious consideration was given to scrapping the class and replacing them with <a href="BR%20Standard%20Class%207">Britannia class</a> locomotives. However, the locomotives had excellent boilers and several other good features and so the decision was taken to rebuild them, removing several of Bulleid's less successful ideas.

On 24 April 1953, the <a href="crank%20axle">crank axle</a> on the central driving wheel of No. 35020 "Bibby Line" fractured whilst approaching <a href="Crewkerne%20railway%20station">Crewkerne station</a> at speed. No-one was injured, but the incident resulted in the withdrawal of all Merchant Navy class locomotives from service whilst the cause was ascertained. An examination of other class members showed that the fracture, caused by metal fatigue, was a common fault. To cover the motive power shortage caused by the mass withdrawal of thirty locomotives, classes from other British Railways regions were drafted in to deputise. The incident resulted in a redesign and replacement of the crank axle.

Partially because of the Crewkerne incident, and due to the incessant modification of Bulleid’s original design, British Railways took the decision to rebuild the entire class to a more conventional design by <a href="R.%20G.%20Jarvis">R. G. Jarvis</a>, adopting many features from the <a href="BR%20standard%20classes">BR 'Standard' locomotive classes</a> that had been introduced since 1950. The air-smoothed casing was removed and replaced with conventional boiler <a href="Cladding%20%28boiler%29">cladding</a>, and the chain-driven valve gear was replaced with three separate sets of <a href="Walschaerts%20valve%20gear">Walschaerts valve gear</a>. The rebuilds were provided with a completely revised cylindrical smokebox, a new Lord Nelson-type chimney and LMS-style smoke deflectors. Together with the lack of air-smoothed casing, these helped reduce the problem of smoke and steam obscuring the driver's vision of the line.

The fast-moving and unpredictable Bulleid <a href="steam%20reverser">steam reverser</a> was replaced with a screw-link version, whilst the <a href="mechanical%20lubricator">mechanical lubricator</a>s were moved to the footplates along the boiler sides. Sanding was also added to the leading driving axle, whilst rearward application was incorporated to the middle driving axle. The first 'modified' locomotive to be released from Eastleigh was 35018 "British India Line" in 1956. The final example, 35028 "Clan Line", was completed in 1960. The success of the modification programme for the Merchant Navy class was also to influence the design of the future modification of 60 'Light Pacifics'.

There is no doubt that rebuilding the class solved most of the maintenance problems, whilst retaining the good features, thereby creating excellent locomotives. One minor drawback was that the 'modifieds' put greater loads on the track as a result of <a href="Hammer%20blow">hammerblow</a>, caused by the balance weights for the outside Walschaerts valve gear, whereas the original valve gear design was largely self-balanced. On 26 June 1967, 35003 "Royal Mail" recorded the highest speed ever for the class. Hauling a train comprising three carriages and two parcels vans (164 tons tare, 180 tons gross) between and <a href="London%20Waterloo%20railway%20station">Waterloo</a>, the mile between milepost 38 and milepost 37 (located between and ) was covered in 34 seconds, a speed of 105.88 mph. This was also the last authenticated speed in excess of 100 mph achieved by a steam locomotive in the United Kingdom, until the same mark was attained in 2017 by <a href="LNER_Peppercorn_Class_A1_60163_Tornado%23100_mph_running">"Tornado"</a>.

Their principal work was on the <a href="South%20Western%20Main%20Line">South Western Main Line</a> to <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> and <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> until 1967. However, the main reason why the class began to be withdrawn in 1964 was the transfer of the main line between Salisbury and Exeter to the Western Region and the introduction of <a href="British%20Rail%20Class%2042">"Warship" class</a> <a href="diesel-hydraulic%20locomotive">diesel-hydraulic locomotive</a>s on these services. The rebuilt locomotives were therefore withdrawn relatively soon after their rebuilding, whilst still in excellent condition. The first two to be withdrawn were the second prototype 35002 "Union Castle" and 35015 "Rotterdam Lloyd" in February 1964. Nearly half of the class had been withdrawn by the end of 1965, but seven survived until the end of steam on the <a href="Southern%20Region%20of%20British%20Railways">Southern Region</a> in the summer of 1967.

Eleven of the class have survived into preservation thanks to the high workload of <a href="Woodham%20Brothers">Woodham Brothers</a> <a href="scrapyard">scrapyard</a> in <a href="Barry%2C%20Vale%20of%20Glamorgan">Barry, Vale of Glamorgan</a>, <a href="South%20Wales">South Wales</a>, which found it easier and more commercially lucrative to scrap railway wagons, keeping the more technical steam locomotives for a downturn in workload. Five of the surviving Merchant Navys have run in preservation, these being: 35005, 35006, 35018, 35027 & 35028. Three of them have even run on the mainline at some points in preservation: 35005 Canadian Pacific, 35018 British India Line and 35028 Clan Line, Both 35018 and 35028 are currently mainline certified.

Ten of the eleven preserved merchant navy's ended up at Barry Scrapyard with one engine, <a href="SR%20Merchant%20Navy%20Class%2035028%20Clan%20Line">35028 "Clan Line"</a> being bought by the Merchant Navy Locomotive Preservation Society direct from British Railways service in 1967, and has since been regarded as the 'flagship' of the class. Although eleven members of the class have survived into the preservation era, it is very likely that many will never steam again, with only five having run in preservation thus far. This is because the class is too large and heavy for use on most of today's heritage railways. As the entire class was rebuilt from 1956 onwards, no Merchant Navy class locomotives exist in as-built condition, although a team are attempting to reverse-engineer 35011 "General Steam Navigation" to original condition. Other relics of the class have survived in the guise of locomotive nameplates and smokebox number plates, which were taken from their locomotives towards the end of steam on the British Railways Southern Region in the 1960s. As a result, many exist in private collections and several have been seen at auctions, selling for several thousands of pounds.

Livery was Southern Railway <a href="malachite%20green">malachite green</a> with "sunshine yellow" horizontal lining and lettering. The first five locomotives were given a matt finish so as to obscure small irregularities in the casing. All class members that operated during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> were eventually repainted in Southern Railway wartime black livery, with green-shaded "Sunshine" lettering. However, this was reverted to malachite green livery upon the ending of hostilities.

21C1 "Channel Packet" originally had an inverted horseshoe on the smokebox door, indicating its Southern origin, but crews believed this to be unlucky. A resultant re-design meant that this became a roundel, the gap being filled by the year of construction, so it acted as a builder's plate. The background was painted red. Early members of the class had cast-iron numberplates and gilt 'Southern' plates on the tender, but these were subsequently replaced by transfers.

After <a href="nationalisation">nationalisation</a> in 1948, the locomotives' initial livery was a slightly modified Southern <a href="malachite%20green">malachite green</a> livery, where "British Railways" replaced "Southern" in Sunshine Yellow lettering on the tender sides. The Bulleid numbering system was temporarily retained, with an additional "S" prefix, such as S21C1. A short-lived second livery was an experimental blue with red lining, as applied to 35024 "East Asiatic Company". This was replaced by British Railways express passenger blue with black and white lining. From 1952, the locomotives carried the standard British Railways <a href="Brunswick%20green">Brunswick green</a> livery with orange and black lining and the British Railways crest on the tender tank sides. This livery was perpetuated after rebuilding.

The class in both as-built and modified forms has been subject to a range of divergent opinions. The utilisation of welded steel construction and the various innovations that had not previously been seen in British locomotive design meant that the class earned Bulleid the title "Last Giant of Steam". The constant concern for ease of maintenance and utility had not previously been seen on locomotives of older design, whilst their highly efficient boilers represented the ultimate in British steam technology, the hallmark of a successful locomotive design. Despite this, the number of innovations introduced at the same time made the class unreliable and difficult to maintain during the first few years of service. Many of these difficulties were overcome during the rebuilding, leading to D.L. Bradley's statement that the modified locomotives were "the finest express locomotives to work in the country". Overall, the class was largely successful, with half of the locomotives completing more than 1 million miles in revenue-earning service.

The Merchant Navy class has been the subject of several models by different manufacturers, including <a href="Hornby%20Railways">Hornby Railways</a>, <a href="Graham%20Farish">Graham Farish</a> and <a href="Trix%20%28company%29">Minitrix</a>. The first <a href="OO%20gauge">OO gauge</a> model of an as-built locomotive was produced by Graham Farish in 1950 followed by Hornby/Wrenn in 1962 and by the modified version.

Hornby and Graham Farish currently produce the rebuilt version of the class in OO gauge and <a href="N%20gauge">N gauge</a> respectively. The Hornby model was introduced in the 2000 edition of the Hornby catalogue. As of December 2010, fifteen members of the class have been produced.

In March 2015, Hornby announced the inclusion of a new as-built version of the class in OO gauge in their 2016 range; this model was subsequently postponed to the 2017 range.

Uruguayan War

The Uruguayan War (10 August 1864 – 20 February 1865) was fought between <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>'s governing <a href="National%20Party%20%28Uruguay%29">Blanco Party</a> and an alliance consisting of the <a href="Empire%20of%20Brazil">Empire of Brazil</a> and the Uruguayan <a href="Colorado%20Party%20%28Uruguay%29">Colorado Party</a>, covertly supported by <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. Since its independence, Uruguay had been ravaged by intermittent struggles between the Colorado and Blanco factions, each attempting to seize and maintain power in turn. The Colorado leader <a href="Venancio%20Flores">Venancio Flores</a> launched the Liberating Crusade in 1863, an insurrection aimed at toppling <a href="Bernardo%20Berro">Bernardo Berro</a>, who presided over a Colorado–Blanco coalition (fusionist) government. Flores was aided by Argentina, whose president <a href="Bartolom%C3%A9%20Mitre">Bartolomé Mitre</a> provided him with supplies, Argentine volunteers and river transport for troops.

The fusionism movement collapsed as the Colorados abandoned the coalition to join Flores' ranks. The Uruguayan Civil War quickly escalated, developing into a crisis of international scope that destabilized the entire region. Even before the Colorado rebellion, the Blancos within fusionism had sought an alliance with <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>an dictator <a href="Francisco%20Solano%20L%C3%B3pez">Francisco Solano López</a>. Berro's now purely Blanco government also received support from Argentine <a href="Federales%20%28Argentina%29">federalists</a>, who opposed Mitre and his <a href="Unitarian%20Party">Unitarians</a>. The situation deteriorated as the Empire of Brazil was drawn into the conflict. Almost one fifth of the Uruguayan population were considered Brazilian. Some joined Flores' rebellion, spurred by discontent with Blanco government policies that they regarded as harmful to their interests. Brazil eventually decided to intervene in the Uruguayan affair to reestablish the security of its southern frontiers and its regional ascendancy.

In April 1864, Brazil sent <a href="Plenipotentiary">Minister Plenipotentiary</a> <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Ant%C3%B4nio%20Saraiva">José Antônio Saraiva</a> to negotiate with <a href="Atanasio%20Aguirre">Atanasio Aguirre</a>, who had succeeded Berro in Uruguay. Saraiva made an initial attempt to settle the dispute between Blancos and Colorados. Faced with Aguirre's intransigence regarding Flores' demands, the Brazilian diplomat abandoned the effort and sided with the Colorados. On 10 August 1864, after a Brazilian ultimatum was refused, Saraiva declared that Brazil's military would begin exacting reprisals. Brazil declined to acknowledge a formal state of war, and for most of its duration, the Uruguayan–Brazilian armed conflict was an <a href="undeclared%20war">undeclared war</a>.

In a combined offensive against Blanco strongholds, the Brazilian–Colorado troops advanced through Uruguayan territory, taking one town after another. Eventually the Blancos were left isolated in <a href="Montevideo">Montevideo</a>, the national capital. Faced with certain defeat, the Blanco government capitulated on 20 February 1865. The short-lived war would have been regarded as an outstanding success for Brazilian and Argentine interests, had Paraguayan intervention in support of the Blancos (with attacks upon Brazilian and Argentine provinces) not led to the long and costly <a href="Paraguayan%20War">Paraguayan War</a>.

The <a href="Oriental%20Republic%20of%20Uruguay">Oriental Republic of Uruguay</a> in South America had been, since its independence in 1828, troubled by strife between the <a href="National%20Party%20%28Uruguay%29">Blanco Party</a> and the <a href="Colorado%20Party%20%28Uruguay%29">Colorado Party</a>. They were not <a href="Political%20party">political parties</a> in the modern sense, but factions that engaged in internecine rebellion whenever the other dominated the government. The nation was deeply divided into Colorado and Blanco camps. These partisan groups formed in the 1830s and arose out of patron–client relationships fostered by local "<a href="caudillo">caudillo</a>s" in the cities and countryside. Rather than a unity based upon common nationalistic sentiments, each had differing aims and loyalties informed by their respective, insular political frameworks.

Uruguay had a very low population density and a weak government. Ordinary citizens were compelled by circumstances to seek the protection of local "caudillos"—landlords who were either Colorados or Blancos and who used their workers, mostly "<a href="gaucho">gaucho</a>" horsemen, as private armies. The civil wars between the two factions were brutal. Harsh tactics produced ever-increasing alienation between the groups, and included seizure of land, confiscation of livestock and executions. The antagonism caused by atrocities, along with family loyalties and political ties, made reconciliation unthinkable. European immigrants, who came in great numbers during the latter half of the nineteenth century, were drawn into one party or the other; both parties had liberal and conservative wings, so the social and political views of newcomers could be reconciled with either. The feuding blocs impeded development of a broadly supported central national administration.

In the latter half of the 1850s, leading members of the Colorados and Blancos attempted a reconciliation. With the approval of many from both parties efforts were made to implement "fusionist" policies, which began to show results in cooperation in government and military spheres. The attempt at healing the schism was dealt a setback in 1858 when reactionaries in the Colorado Party rejected the scheme. The revolt was put down by <a href="Gabriel%20Antonio%20Pereira">Gabriel Pereira</a>, a former Colorado and Uruguayan president under the fusionist government. The rebellious leaders were executed at Paso de Quinteros along the <a href="R%C3%ADo%20Negro%20%28Uruguay%29">Río Negro</a>, sparking renewed conflict. The Colorados suspected fusionism of promoting Blanco aims to their own detriment and called for the "martyrs of Quinteros" to be avenged.

With the internal weaknesses of fusionism now exposed, the Colorados moved to oust its supporters from the government. Their leader, Brigadier General <a href="Venancio%20Flores">Venancio Flores</a>, a "caudillo" and an early proponent of fusionism, found himself without sufficient military resources to mount a sustained revolt and resorted to asking for intervention by Argentina.

Argentina was a fragmented nation (since the 1852 downfall of Argentine dictator <a href="Juan%20Manuel%20de%20Rosas">Juan Manuel de Rosas</a>), with the <a href="Argentine%20Confederation">Argentine Confederation</a> and the <a href="State%20of%20Buenos%20Aires">State of Buenos Aires</a> each vying for supremacy. Flores approached the Buenos Aires Minister of War, <a href="Bartolom%C3%A9%20Mitre">Bartolomé Mitre</a>, agreeing to throw the support of the Colorados behind Buenos Aires in exchange for subsequent Argentine assistance in their fight against the fusionist government in <a href="Montevideo">Montevideo</a> (the Uruguayan capital). Flores and his Colorado units served Buenos Aires with fierce determination. They played a decisive role in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pav%C3%B3n">Battle of Pavón</a> on 17 September 1861, in which the Confederation was defeated and all Argentina was reunited under the government in Buenos Aires.

In fulfillment of his commitment, Mitre arranged for the Colorado militia, Argentine volunteer units and supplies to be carried aboard Argentine vessels to Uruguay in May and June 1863. Ships of the Argentine navy kept Uruguayan gunships away from the operation. Back on his native soil, Flores called for the ouster of the constitutional government, by that time headed by <a href="Bernardo%20Berro">Bernardo Berro</a>. Flores accused the Montevideo government of Blanco sympathies and framed his "Liberating Crusade" (as he called his rebellion) in the familiar terms of a Colorado vs. Blanco struggle. Colorados from rural areas joined defectors from the military in responding to his call.

Although the Colorados had defected to the Flores insurgency, the national guard continued to support the fusionist government. Blanco partisans filled its depleted ranks. They also replaced army officers who had deserted to Flores. The Blancos received aid from several Argentine <a href="Federales%20%28Argentina%29">Federalists</a> who joined their cause. As in Uruguay, Argentina had long been a battleground of rival parties, and Bartolomé Mitre's victory at Pavón in 1861 had signaled the triumph of his <a href="Unitarian%20Party">Unitarian Party</a> over the Federal Party led by <a href="Justo%20Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Urquiza">Justo José de Urquiza</a>. Mitre denied any involvement in the Flores rebellion, even though his complicity was widely known and taken for granted.

Relations between Argentina and Uruguay worsened, and both nations came close to declaring war on each other, although neither could afford a direct military conflict. Argentina had only recently emerged from a long civil war, and was still struggling to suppress a Federalist rebellion in its western province of <a href="La%20Rioja%20Province%2C%20Argentina">La Rioja</a>. Uruguay was too weak militarily to engage in a fight unaided.

Since 1862, the Blancos had made repeated overtures to <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>, governed by dictator <a href="Carlos%20Antonio%20L%C3%B3pez">Carlos Antonio López</a>, in an attempt to forge an alliance that might advance both their interests in the Platine region. Upon the death of López, his son, <a href="Francisco%20Solano%20L%C3%B3pez">Francisco Solano López</a>, succeeded him as Paraguayan dictator. Unlike the elder López, who strove to avoid encumbering alliances, Solano greeted the Blanco's proposal with enthusiasm. He believed Argentina was working towards the annexation of both Uruguay and Paraguay, with the goal of recreating the <a href="Viceroyalty%20of%20the%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata</a>, the former Spanish colony that once encompassed the territories of all three nations. Solano López had, as far back as 1855, expressed this concern, commenting to the Uruguayan <a href="Andr%C3%A9s%20Lamas%20%28writer%29">Andrés Lamas</a> that "the idea of reconstructing [the old viceroyalty] is in the soul of the Argentines; and as a result, it isn't just Paraguay that needs to stand guard: your country, the Oriental Republic [of Uruguay], needs to get along with my own in order to prepare for any eventualities." In late 1863, Solano López was mobilizing his army and was in talks with Urquiza, the leader of the dissident Argentine Federalists, to convince him to join the proposed Paraguayan–Uruguayan alliance.

The developments in Uruguay were closely watched by the Empire of Brazil, which had vital interests in the <a href="R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata%20Basin">Río de la Plata Basin</a>. After Rosas fell in 1852, Brazil became the dominant regional power. Its foreign policy included the covert underwriting of opposition parties in Uruguay and Argentina, preventing strong governments that might threaten Brazil's strategic position in the area. Brazilian banking and commercial firms also had ventures in the area, furthering ties within the region. In Uruguay, the bank run by <a href="Irineu%20Evangelista%20de%20Sousa%2C%20Viscount%20of%20Mau%C3%A1">Irineu Evangelista de Sousa</a> (Baron and later Viscount of Mauá) became so heavily involved in commercial enterprises that the economy depended on this source of continued capital flow.

About 18 percent (40,000) of the Uruguayan population (220,000) spoke <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> and regarded themselves as Brazilian rather than Uruguayan. Many within Flores' ranks were Brazilians, some hailing from the nearby Brazilian province of <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a>. Life along the frontier between Rio Grande do Sul and Uruguay was often chaotic, with hostilities erupting between partisans of various <a href="cattle%20baron">cattle baron</a>s, cattle-rustling and random killings. Large landowners on both sides of the border had long been antagonistic toward Berro's policies. The Uruguayan president attempted to tax the cattle coming from Rio Grande do Sul and to impose curbs on the use of Brazilian slaves within Uruguayan territory; slavery had been outlawed years before in Uruguay.

Among the Brazilian land barons were <a href="David%20Canabarro">David Canabarro</a> and <a href="Ant%C3%B4nio%20de%20Sousa%20Neto">Antônio de Sousa Neto</a>, both allies of Flores and former separatist rebels during the <a href="Ragamuffin%20War">Ragamuffin War</a> that had ravaged Rio Grande do Sul from 1835 until 1845. Canabarro, a frontier military commander, misled Brazil's government by denying that Brazilians were crossing the border to join Flores. Sousa Neto went to the <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Brazilian capital</a> to request immediate government intervention in Uruguay, claiming that Brazilians were being murdered and their ranches robbed. The "fact that Uruguayan citizens had just as valid claims against Brazil as Brazilians had against Uruguay was ignored", said historian Philip Raine. Although Sousa Neto had ties with the governing political party, his claims, including that he could amass a force of 40,000 to invade Uruguay, were not taken seriously by all. The Uruguayan crisis arrived at a difficult moment for Brazil, which was on the verge of a full-blown war with the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> for unrelated reasons. Brazil's government decided to intervene in Uruguay, fearful of showing any weakness in the face of an impending conflict with Britain, and believing that it would be better for the central government to take the lead rather than allow the Brazilian ranchers on the frontier to decide the course of events.

On 1 March 1864, Berro's term of office ended. The ongoing civil war prevented elections; therefore <a href="Atanasio%20Aguirre">Atanasio Aguirre</a>, president of the Uruguayan senate and a member of the Amapolas (the radical wing of the Blanco Party) replaced Berro, on an interim basis. In April, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Ant%C3%B4nio%20Saraiva">José Antônio Saraiva</a> was appointed <a href="Plenipotentiary">minister plenipotentiary</a> by the Brazilian government and charged with quickly reaching an accord that would settle Brazil's claims and ensure the safety of Brazilian citizens. His focus soon shifted from satisfying Brazil's terms to a more immediate goal of hammering out a deal between the antagonists in the civil war, with the expectation that only a more stable regime would be able to reach a settlement with Brazil.

The government in Montevideo was at first reluctant to consider Saraiva's proposals. With backing from Paraguay, it saw little advantage in negotiating a close to the civil war or in seeking to comply with Brazil's demands. The main factor, as historian Jeffrey D. Needell summarized, was that the "Uruguayan president had been unwilling to resolve these, particularly because the Brazilians whose grievances were at issue were allies of Venancio Flores, a client of the Argentines, and a man who was seeking his overthrow." A mutual enmity between Brazil and its Hispanic-American neighbors compounded the difficulties, the result of a long-standing distrust and rivalry between Spain and Portugal that had been carried over to their former American colonies. Brazil and Uruguay exhibited loathing for one another; as <a href="Robert%20Bontine%20Cunninghame%20Graham">Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham</a> put it: "the Brazilians holding the Uruguayans as bloodthirsty savages, and the Uruguayans returning their contempt for the unwarlike ways of the Brazilians, whom they called monkeys, and looked down upon, for their mixed blood."

Eventually, in July 1864, Saraiva's persistent diplomacy moved the Uruguayan government to agree to mediated talks including <a href="Edward%20Thornton%20%28diplomat%29">Edward Thornton</a> (the British <a href="Resident%20%28title%29">resident minister</a> in Buenos Aires), Argentine foreign minister <a href="Rufino%20de%20Elizalde">Rufino de Elizalde</a> and Saraiva himself. Initially, the negotiations seemed promising, but soon bogged down. On 4 August, convinced that the government in Montevideo was unwilling to work toward a settlement, a frustrated Saraiva delivered an ultimatum, which the Uruguayans rebuffed. On 10 August, Saraiva informed Aguirre that the Brazilian military commanders would receive orders to begin retaliation, marking the beginning of the war.

Under the orders of Vice-Admiral <a href="Joaquim%20Marques%20Lisboa%2C%20Marquis%20of%20Tamandar%C3%A9">Joaquim Marques Lisboa</a> (Baron of Tamandaré), a Brazilian fleet was stationed in Uruguayan <a href="territorial%20waters">territorial waters</a>. The naval force comprised twelve steamships: one <a href="frigate">frigate</a>, six <a href="corvette">corvette</a>s and five <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a>s. On 11 August 1864, Tamandaré, as the commander-in-chief of Brazilian naval and land forces in the war, received orders from Saraiva to begin retaliatory operations. Brazilian warships were deployed to the Uruguayan towns of <a href="Salto%2C%20Uruguay">Salto</a>, <a href="Paysand%C3%BA">Paysandú</a> and <a href="Maldonado%2C%20Uruguay">Maldonado</a>, ostensibly to "protect Brazilian subjects", while Uruguay's only warships, the small steamers "Villa del Salto" and "General Artigas", were to be neutralized. When Tamandaré demanded these steamships remain at their docks, only the crew of "General Artigas" complied.

Tamandaré created a naval command assigned to Captain of Sea and War <a href="Francisco%20Pereira%20Pinto%2C%20Baron%20of%20Ivinhema">Francisco Pereira Pinto</a> (later Baron of Ivinhema). Consisting of two corvettes and one gunboat, the division was sent to patrol the <a href="Uruguay%20River">Uruguay River</a>, a tributary of the <a href="R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">Río de la Plata</a> and part of the Platine region. On 24 August, Pereira Pinto sighted the "Villa del Salto", which was conveying troops to fight the Colorados. The "Villa del Salto" ignored warning shots and a demand to surrender; after a desperate run from the Brazilian warships, it escaped to Argentine waters. This first skirmish of the war prompted the Uruguayan government to sever all diplomatic ties with Brazil on 30 August. On 7 September, Pereira Pinto again encountered the "Villa del Salto" sailing from Salto to Paysandú. The two Brazilian corvettes attacked the Uruguayan ship as it again tried to escape to Argentina. The battle ended when the "Villa del Salto" ran aground near Paysandú, where its crew set it on fire to prevent it falling into Brazilian hands. Meanwhile, the "General Artigas" had been sold to prevent its capture by the Brazilians.

To Flores, Brazil's military operations against the Blanco government represented a priceless opportunity, since he had been unable to achieve any lasting results during the rebellion. He entered talks with Saraiva, winning the Brazilian government over, after promising to settle their claims refused by the Blanco government. The Brazilian plenipotentiary minister gave instructions to Tamandaré to form a joint offensive with the Colorado leader and overthrow the Blancos. On 20 October, after a swift exchange of letters, Flores and the Brazilian vice-admiral formed a secret alliance.

The Brazilian naval fleet in Uruguay was supposed to work in conjunction with a Brazilian land force. But months passed, and the "Army of the South" (called the "Division of Observation" until the ultimatum) stationed in Piraí Grande (in Rio Grande do Sul) was still not ready to cross into Uruguayan territory. Its main objectives were to occupy the Uruguayan towns of <a href="Paysand%C3%BA">Paysandú</a>, <a href="Salto%2C%20Uruguay">Salto</a> and <a href="Melo%2C%20Uruguay">Melo</a>; once taken, they were to be handed over to Flores and his Colorados.

On 12 October, a brigade led by Brigadier <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Lu%C3%ADs%20Mena%20Barreto%20%281817%E2%80%9379%29">José Luís Mena Barreto</a> detached from the main army. Two days later, near the Brazilian town of <a href="Jaguar%C3%A3o">Jaguarão</a>, the force invaded Uruguay's <a href="Cerro%20Largo%20Department">Cerro Largo Department</a>. After skirmishes failed to halt their march, the Blancos abandoned Melo, and the brigade entered this capital of Cerro Largo unopposed, on 16 October. After handing over control of Melo to the Uruguayan Colorados, the Brazilians withdrew on 24 October, to rejoin their Army of the South. The next Brazilian target was Salto. Pereira Pinto sent two gunboats under First Lieutenant Joaquim José Pinto to blockade the town. On 24 November, Flores arrived with his troops and <a href="Siege%20of%20Salto">began the siege</a>. Colonel <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Palomeque">José Palomeque</a>, commander of the Uruguayan garrison, surrendered almost without firing a shot, on the afternoon of 28 November. Flores' army captured and incorporated four artillery pieces and 250 men; 300 Colorados and 150 Brazilians were left behind to occupy Salto.

Paysandú, the last Brazilian target, was already under blockade by Pereira Pinto. Tamandaré, who had been in Buenos Aires until this point, took charge of the blockade on 3 December. It was enforced by one corvette and four gunboats. Paysandú was garrisoned by 1,274 men and 15 cannons, under the command of Colonel <a href="Leandro%20G%C3%B3mez">Leandro Gómez</a>. Flores, who had come from Salto, headed a force of 3,000 men, mostly cavalry. He <a href="Siege%20of%20Paysand%C3%BA">invested Paysandú</a>, deploying 800 infantrymen, 7 cannons (3 of which were <a href="Rifling">rifled</a>), and detachments of an additional 660 Brazilians. Gómez declined the offer to surrender. From 6 December until 8 December, the Brazilians and Colorados made attempts to storm the town, advancing through the streets, but were unable to take it. Tamandaré and Flores opted to wait for the arrival of the Army of the South. Meanwhile, Aguirre had sent General <a href="Juan%20S%C3%A1a">Juan Sáa</a> with 3,000 men and four cannons to relieve the besieged town, forcing the Brazilians and Colorados to briefly lift the siege while dealing with this new threat. Sáa abandoned his advance before encountering the enemy force, and fled north of the Río Negro.

Rather than the show of force that had been intended by the Brazilian government, the war revealed the Empire's lack of military readiness. The Army of the South, stationed in Piraí Grande, was commanded by Field Marshal <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20Prop%C3%ADcio%20Mena%20Barreto%2C%202nd%20Baron%20of%20S%C3%A3o%20Gabriel">João Propício Mena Barreto</a> (later Baron of São Gabriel) with two divisions. The 1st Division, under Brigadier <a href="Manuel%20Lu%C3%ADs%20Os%C3%B3rio%2C%20Marquis%20of%20Erval">Manuel Luís Osório</a> (later Marquis of Erval), was formed by regular army units. The 2nd Division, under Brigadier José Luís Mena Barreto (who had since returned from his attack on Melo), was composed entirely of national guardsmen. Altogether, it numbered only 5,711 men—all (except some officers) native to Rio Grande do Sul. The army was poorly equipped for siege operations: it brought along no engineers (who could direct the construction of trenches); it was under-equipped, lacking even <a href="hatchet">hatchet</a>s (necessary to cut fences, break through doors and scale walls); and its 12 cannons (a mix of <a href="La%20Hitte%20system">La Hitte</a> and <a href="Paixhans%20gun">Paixhans</a>) were of small calibers ill-suited to attacking fortifications.

On 1 December, almost four months after Saraiva presented the ultimatum, the Army of the South invaded Uruguay. Its troops were accompanied by a semi-independent militia unit, consisting of no more than 1,300 Brazilian "gaucho" cavalrymen, under the former <a href="Ragamuffin%20War">Ragamuffin</a> <a href="Ant%C3%B4nio%20de%20Sousa%20Neto">Antônio de Sousa Neto</a>. The 7,011-strong force (with 200 supply carts) marched through Uruguayan territory unopposed, heading toward Paysandú in the southwest. The disorganized and undisciplined bands of "gauchos", who formed the armies of both Blancos and Colorados, were no match for the Brazilian troops. The Uruguayan "gauchos" "had combat experience but no training and were poorly armed save for the usual muskets, "<a href="Bolas">boleadoras</a>", and "<a href="fac%C3%B3n">facón</a>" knives", remarked historian Thomas L. Whigham. "Fire arms he [the Uruguayan gaucho] rarely possessed", said Cunninghame Graham, "or if by chance he owned a pair of long brass-mounted pistols or a <a href="flintlock">flintlock</a> <a href="blunderbuss">blunderbuss</a>, they were in general out of order and unserviceable. Upon the other hand, a little training made him a formidable adversary with the sabre and the lance."

Field Marshal João Propício Mena Barreto reached Paysandú on 29 December with two infantry brigades and one artillery regiment under Lieutenant Colonel <a href="%C3%89mile%20Louis%20Mallet%2C%20Baron%20of%20Itapevi">Émile Louis Mallet</a> (later Baron of Itapevi). The Army of the South's cavalry established its camp a few kilometers away. Meanwhile, Gómez beheaded forty Colorados and fifteen Brazilian prisoners and "hung their still-dripping heads above his trenches in full view of their compatriots." On 31 December, the Brazilians and Colorados recommenced their attack and overran the city's defenses, after a bitter struggle, on 2 January 1865. The Brazilians captured Gómez and handed him over to the Colorados. Colonel Gregorio "Goyo" Suárez shot Gómez and three of his officers. According to Whigham, "Suárez's actions were not really unexpected, as several members of his immediate family had fallen victim to Gómez's wrath against the Colorados."

On 12 November 1864, before the siege of Paysandú, the Paraguayan dictator Solano López seized the Brazilian steamer "Marquês de Olinda", beginning the Paraguayan War. While the Army of the South crossed Uruguay heading toward Paysandú, Brazil's government sent <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Paranhos%2C%20Viscount%20of%20Rio%20Branco">José Maria da Silva Paranhos</a> (later Viscount of Rio Branco) to replace Saraiva. He arrived in the Argentine capital of <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a> on 2 December and a few days later sought a formal alliance with Mitre against the Blancos. The Argentine president refused, insisting that neither he nor his government had any role in Flores' rebellion, and that Argentina would remain neutral. On 26 December, the Paraguayans invaded the Brazilian province of <a href="Mato%20Grosso">Mato Grosso</a>, laying waste to towns and the countryside.

As the situation deteriorated, the Brazilian government mobilized army units from other regions of the Empire. On 1 January 1865, one brigade (composed of two infantry battalions and one artillery battalion) with 1,700 men from the Brazilian province of <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro%20%28state%29">Rio de Janeiro</a> disembarked and occupied the Uruguayan town of <a href="Fray%20Bentos">Fray Bentos</a>. Paranhos, along with Tamandaré, met Flores in Fray Bentos and decided to launch a combined attack against Montevideo. It was apparent that the Paraguayans would take too long to reach Uruguay and no help would come from Urquiza and his Argentine Federalists. Increasingly isolated, Aguirre hoped that the foreign powers could intervene, but when, on 11 January, he asked the diplomatic corps in Montevideo whether they would provide military assistance to him and his government, none responded positively. João Propício Mena Barreto sailed from Fray Bentos on 14 January with the Brazilian infantry, bound for a landing near the mouth of the <a href="Santa%20Luc%C3%ADa%20River">Santa Lucía River</a> near Montevideo. On the way, he occupied the Uruguayan town of <a href="Colonia%20del%20Sacramento">Colonia del Sacramento</a>, garrisoning it with 50 soldiers.

The cavalry and artillery were placed under Osório and went overland. They met João Propício Mena Barreto and the infantry at their landing place. From there, the reunited Army of the South marched on Montevideo. On 31 January, Brazil and the Colorados besieged the Uruguayan capital. In the meantime, on 19 January, Paranhos attempted to clarify the nature of the Brazilian operations against the Blancos. He issued notes to the foreign diplomatic corps in Buenos Aires <a href="Declaration%20of%20war">declaring that a state of war</a> existed between Brazil and Uruguay. Until then, there had been <a href="Undeclared%20war">no formal declaration of war</a>, and the Empire's military operations in Uruguay since August 1864 had been mere "reprisals"—the vague term used by Brazilian diplomacy since the ultimatum.

In an attempt to divert the attention of Brazil from the siege of the capital, the Blanco government ordered the "Vanguard Army of the Republic of Uruguay", composed of 1,500 men under General <a href="Basilio%20Mu%C3%B1oz">Basilio Muñoz</a>, to invade Brazilian soil. On 27 January 1865, Muñoz crossed the border and exchanged fire with 500 cavalrymen from Brazil's National Guard units. The Brazilians retreated to the town of Jaguarão, where they were joined by 90 infantrymen also from the National Guard, and hurriedly constructed trenches. There were also two small steamers and one other large vessel, each equipped with one artillery piece, to protect Jaguarão. The Blanco army attacked the town in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jaguar%C3%A3o">Battle of Jaguarão</a>, but were repelled. Muñoz established a brief siege and asked Colonel Manuel Pereira Vargas (the commander of the Brazilian garrison) to surrender, but to no effect. In the early hours of 28 January, Muñoz retreated with his men toward Uruguay, ransacking property and taking all the slaves they could find.

On 2 February, Tamandaré declared to foreign diplomats that Montevideo was under siege and blockade. The Uruguayan capital was defended by between 3,500 and 4,000 armed men with little to no combat experience and 40 artillery pieces of various calibers. On 16 February, the Army of the South was further reinforced by 1,228 men from the 8th Battalion of "Caçadores" (Sharpshooters) arriving from the Brazilian province of <a href="Bahia">Bahia</a>, raising its numbers to 8,116. Sousa Neto and his gauchos had detached from the main force weeks before to pursue Muñoz and his army. British and French nationals were evacuated to Buenos Aires. The "general exodus of foreigners that followed caused those who remained in Montevideo to feel terror for the first time. All agreed that a full-scale assault against the city could not be postponed." However, neither Paranhos nor his government were willing to risk the destruction of Montevideo and face the inevitable outcry from other nations that would follow it.

On 15 February, Aguirre's term of office expired. Against the wishes of the "Amapolas", the moderate <a href="Tom%C3%A1s%20Villalba">Tomás Villalba</a> was elected by the Senate to replace Aguirre. French, Italian and Spanish troops landed in Montevideo at Villalba's request to dissuade the radical Blancos from attempting a <a href="Coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup</a> to retake power. Villalba entered into talks with Flores and Paranhos. With the Italian resident minister <a href="Raffaele%20Ulisse%20Barbolani">Raffaele Ulisse Barbolani</a> serving as intermediary, an agreement was reached. Flores and <a href="Manuel%20Herrera%20y%20Obes">Manuel Herrera y Obes</a> (representing Villalba's government) signed a peace accord on 20 February at the <a href="Uni%C3%B3n%2C%20Montevideo">Villa de la Unión</a>. A general amnesty was granted to both Blancos and Colorados, and Villalba handed over the presidency to Flores on an interim basis until elections could be held.

In early March, Flores assembled a cabinet composed entirely of Colorados, among them a brother of the Blanco Leandro Gómez. The new Uruguayan president purged government departments of employees with Fusionist or Blanco associations. All Blanco officers and enlisted men were eliminated from the army and replaced by those Colorado and Brazilian loyalists who had remained with Flores throughout the conflict. Public commemorations glorified the Colorados, and a monument dedicated to the "Martyrs of Quinteros" was erected. The costs of the Liberating Crusade are unknown. Flores' losses amounted to around 450 dead and wounded; there are no estimates of the number of civilians who died of famine and disease, nor is it known how much damage was sustained by the national economy. The effects of the Uruguayan War have received little attention from historians, who have been drawn to focus on the dramatic devastation suffered by Paraguay in the subsequent <a href="Paraguayan%20War">Paraguayan War</a>.

News of the war's end was brought by Pereira Pinto and met with joy in Rio de Janeiro. Brazilian Emperor <a href="Dom%20%28title%29">Dom</a> <a href="Pedro%20II%20of%20Brazil">Pedro II</a> found himself waylaid by a crowd of thousands in the streets amid acclamations. But public opinion quickly changed for the worse, when newspapers began running stories painting the accord of 20 February as harmful to Brazilian interests, for which the cabinet was blamed. The newly raised Viscount of Tamandaré and Mena Barreto (now Baron of São Gabriel) had supported the peace accord. Tamandaré changed his mind soon afterward and played along with the allegations. Paranhos (a member of the opposition party) was used as a scapegoat by the Emperor and the government, and was recalled in disgrace to the imperial capital. Subsequent events show the accusation was unfounded. Not only had Paranhos managed to settle all Brazilian claims, but by avoiding the death of thousands, he gained a willing and grateful Uruguayan ally, not a dubious and resentful one — who provided Brazil an important base of operations during the war with Paraguay that followed.

Victory brought mixed results for Brazil and Argentina. As the Brazilian government had expected, the conflict was a short-lived and relatively easy affair that led to the installation of a friendly government in Uruguay. The official estimates included 549 battlefield casualties (109 dead, 439 wounded and 1 missing) from the navy and army and an unknown number who died from disease. Historian José Bernardino Bormann put the total at 616 (204 dead, 411 wounded and 1 missing). The war would have been deemed an outstanding success for Brazil, had it not been for its terrible consequences. Instead of demonstrating strength, Brazil revealed military weakness that an emboldened Paraguay sought to exploit. From the Argentine viewpoint, most of Bartolomé Mitre's expectations were frustrated by the war's outcome. He had succeeded in bringing to power his friend and ally, but the minimal risk and cost to Argentina he had envisioned at the outset proved to be illusory. The resulting attack by Paraguay on Brazilian and Argentine provinces sparked the long and devastating Paraguayan War.

Henry Burrell (admiral)

<a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> Sir Henry Mackay Burrell, (13 August 1904 – 9 February 1988) was a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> (RAN). He served as <a href="Chief%20of%20Navy%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Naval Staff</a> (CNS) from 1959 to 1962. Born in the <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28Australia%29">Blue Mountains</a>, Burrell entered the <a href="HMAS%20Creswell">Royal Australian Naval College</a> in 1918 as a thirteen-year-old cadet. His first posting at sea was aboard the cruiser . During the 1920s and 1930s, Burrell served for several years on exchange with the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, specialising as a navigator. Following the outbreak of World War II, he filled a key liaison post with the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">US Navy</a>, and later saw action as commander of the destroyer , earning a <a href="Mentioned%20in%20Despatches">mention in despatches</a>.

Promoted <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">captain</a> in 1946, Burrell played a major role in the formation of the RAN's <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm%20%28RAN%29">Fleet Air Arm</a>, before commanding the flagship in 1948–49. He captained the light aircraft carrier in 1953–54, and was twice <a href="Commander%20Australian%20Fleet">Flag Officer of the Australian Fleet</a>, in 1955–56 and 1958. Burrell was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in 1955 and a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in 1959. As CNS, he began a major program of acquisitions for the Navy, including new helicopters, <a href="Minesweeper%20%28ship%29">minesweepers</a>, submarines and <a href="guided%20missile%20destroyer">guided-missile destroyer</a>s. He also acted to reverse a plan by the government of the day to dismantle the Fleet Air Arm. <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knighted</a> in 1960, Burrell retired to his farm near Canberra in 1962 and published his memoirs, "Mermaids Do Exist", in 1986. He died two years later, aged eighty-three.

Henry Mackay Burrell was born at <a href="Wentworth%20Falls%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Wentworth Falls</a>, in the <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28Australia%29">Blue Mountains district</a> of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. He was the third child and only son of schoolteacher Thomas Burrell and his wife Eliza. Henry's father, who had emigrated from England, joined the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> at the age of fifty-five during World War I, seeing active service in Egypt. His grandfather and great-grandfather had served in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. Henry attended <a href="Parramatta%20High%20School">Parramatta High School</a> before entering the <a href="HMAS%20Creswell">Royal Australian Naval College</a>, Jervis Bay, on 1 January 1918, at the age of thirteen. A keen sportsman, he competed in <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a>, <a href="tennis">tennis</a> and <a href="Field%20hockey">hockey</a>, winning <a href="Sporting%20colours">colours</a> for hockey. Burrell graduated from the college in 1921 and became a <a href="midshipman">midshipman</a> the next year. He went to sea first aboard the light cruiser and then the destroyer . Posted to the United Kingdom for further training in 1924, he served on the light cruiser and the battleship . In April 1925, he was promoted to <a href="sub-lieutenant">sub-lieutenant</a>, rising to <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> by July 1926.
After attending a Royal Navy course in 1930, Burrell became a specialist navigator, and saw service aboard the minesweeper <a href="Hunt-class%20minesweeper%20%281916%29">HMS "Pangbourne"</a>, destroyers and , and cruiser . He married Margaret MacKay at <a href="Scots%27%20Church%2C%20Melbourne">Scots' Church, Melbourne</a>, on 27 December 1933. Burrell was promoted to <a href="lieutenant%20commander">lieutenant commander</a> in July 1934, and graduated from an advanced navigation course the following year.

Burrell served on exchange with the Royal Navy as navigator aboard the cruisers and , the latter during her tour of duty in the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. Described as being "egalitarian" and "approachable", his familiarity with <a href="Naval%20rating">ratings</a> earned him the criticism of "Devonshire"s captain; Burrell however believed that a close relationship between officers and men was necessary for the smooth running of a ship. After completing the Royal Navy's staff course in 1938, he returned to Australia and was appointed staff officer (operations) at the Navy Office, Melbourne, in March 1939. It was Burrell's first shore-based position, and he spent the next four months bringing naval sections of the "War Book" (preparations for war) up to date.

Burrell was still based at the Navy Office when World War II broke out in September 1939. A reorganisation of the headquarters in May 1940 saw him promoted to <a href="commander">commander</a> and given the new role of Director of Operations, overseeing troop convoys and their air cover, local defence, and staffing issues. Burrell's "full knowledge of Australian naval plans and resources" led to Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> personally nominating him to participate in staff talks with representatives of the Royal Navy and <a href="United%20States%20Navy">US Navy</a> in October. Soon after, he was posted as the first Australian naval <a href="Military%20attach%C3%A9">attaché</a> to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, in an effort to improve communications with the US in light of the threat from Japan. Burrell was credited with helping to foster closer cooperation between the two navies in the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific region</a>. He also warned the Australian government that Britain and the US would adopt a "Germany-first" strategy in the event of war with Japan, and that the US was prepared to weaken its Pacific fleet to help secure the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Atlantic</a>.

Posted to Britain, Burrell was appointed <a href="commanding%20officer">commanding officer</a> of the newly commissioned <a href="J%2C%20K%20and%20N-class%20destroyer">N-class</a> destroyer on 15 September 1941. The ship's first operation was transporting a <a href="Trade%20Union%20Congress">Trade Union Congress</a> delegation led by <a href="Walter%20Citrine%2C%201st%20Baron%20Citrine">Sir Walter Citrine</a> to <a href="Arkhangelsk">Archangel</a>, Russia. After returning to Britain, she steamed to the <a href="Indian%20Ocean%20in%20World%20War%20II">Indian Ocean</a> to join Admiral <a href="James%20Somerville">Sir James Somerville</a>'s <a href="Eastern%20Fleet">Eastern Fleet</a> at <a href="Addu%20Atoll">Addu Atoll</a>, Maldives, on 26 February 1942. Following the Eastern Fleet's withdrawal to <a href="Kilindini%20Harbour">Kilindini</a>, Kenya, "Norman" took part in the capture of <a href="Antsiranana">Diego Suarez</a> on <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> on 7 May. Later that month, she was reassigned to the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Mediterranean</a> and in June was involved in <a href="Operation%20Vigorous">Operation Vigorous</a>, an unsuccessful attempt to resupply the besieged island of <a href="Malta">Malta</a>. Transferred back to the Indian Ocean, Burrell led "Norman" in the second campaign of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Madagascar">Battle of Madagascar</a> in September, and was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> on 19 February 1943 for his "bravery and resource" during the operation. By this time "Norman" was escorting convoys in the Pacific, before deploying to the South Atlantic for <a href="anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine duties</a> in April–May.

On 23 June 1943, Burrell relinquished command of "Norman" and returned to the Navy Office, Melbourne, as Director of Plans. Having been divorced from his first wife Margaret in November 1941, he married <a href="mineralogist">mineralogist</a> Ada Weller (also known as Ada Coggan) on 21 April 1944; the couple had a son and two daughters. Burrell took charge of the RAN's latest destroyer, , at her commissioning in Sydney on 25 May 1945. Arriving on the scene too late to see action, the ship was deployed to Japan via the Philippines in July, docking in Tokyo on 31 August. There she participated in the <a href="Japanese%20Instrument%20of%20Surrender">formal surrender ceremonies</a> that took place on 2 September aboard . "Bataan" remained in Japan as Australian Squadron representative until November, assisting with the repatriation of inmates from Japanese <a href="prisoner-of-war%20camp">prisoner-of-war camp</a>s. On a mission to one such camp at <a href="Sendai">Sendai</a>, Burrell located crewmen from the light cruiser , which had been sunk in the early hours of 1 March 1942 during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sunda%20Strait">Battle of Sunda Strait</a>; 320 of her complement of 680 survived the sinking, 105 dying in captivity.

Burrell's first appointment following the cessation of hostilities was as commander of the 10th Destroyer Flotilla. He was promoted <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">captain</a> in June 1946, and became <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Navy%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff</a> (DCNS) that October. As DCNS, Burrell played a major role in establishing the Navy's <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm%20%28RAN%29">Fleet Air Arm</a> and preparing for the introduction of carrier-based aircraft. He was appointed an <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a> to Governor-General <a href="William%20McKell">William McKell</a> in July 1947. From October 1948 to the end of 1949, Burrell served as commanding officer of the heavy cruiser , <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the RAN. Posted to Britain in 1950, he attended the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College</a>, London, and spent two years as Assistant Australian Defence Representative. He took command of the light aircraft carrier on 2 December 1952, less than three weeks after she was commissioned into the RAN after transfer from the Royal Navy. The ship began working up for deployment to the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> in June 1953, but in the end her place was taken by the carrier . "Vengeance" was involved in a collision with HMAS "Bataan" near the <a href="Cocos%20Islands">Cocos Islands</a> on 5 April 1954, while acting as part of the escort for the <a href="Royal%20Yacht">Royal Yacht</a> of <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> and <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Philip</a> during their inaugural tour of Australia, but continued on duty.

Completing his tour as captain of "Vengeance", Burrell briefly resumed the role of Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff in August 1954. The following month he was made an aide-de-camp to the Queen. Burrell was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the 1955 <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a>. In February he became <a href="Commander%20Australian%20Fleet">Flag Officer of the Australian Fleet</a>, with the acting rank of <a href="rear%20admiral">rear admiral</a>; this was made substantive in July. On 12 May 1956, he hoisted his standard aboard the recently arrived aircraft carrier , marking her replacement of sister ship HMAS "Sydney" as flagship of the RAN. Burrell was posted soon afterwards to the Navy Office, Canberra, to redevelop the service's officer structure, leading to a new "General List" of officers' seniority. He served as <a href="Australian%20Commonwealth%20Naval%20Board">Second Naval Member (Personnel)</a> from September 1956 until January 1958, when he again became Flag Officer of the Australian Fleet. Appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in the 1959 New Years Honours, Burrell was raised to <a href="vice%20admiral">vice admiral</a> on 24 February and became First Naval Member, the <a href="Chief%20of%20Navy%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Naval Staff</a> (CNS). He succeeded Vice Admiral <a href="Roy%20Dowling">Sir Roy Dowling</a>.
As CNS, Vice Admiral Burrell had to contend with a threat by Defence Minister <a href="Athol%20Townley">Athol Townley</a> to disband the Navy's fixed-wing Fleet Air Arm capability by 1963, but gained approval for a major vessel re-equipment drive that was to include new submarines, destroyers, minesweepers, and <a href="Auxiliary%20ship">auxiliaries</a>. This led among other things to the procurement of British s, selected by Burrell when his original preference for an Australian-built craft proved too expensive, as well as s and the Navy's first purpose-designed <a href="hydrographic%20survey">hydrographic survey</a> ship, . The re-equipment program also resulted in augmentation of the RAN's rotary-wing assets with <a href="Westland%20Wessex">Westland Wessex</a> anti-submarine warfare helicopters. Most significant was the purchase of three guided-missile destroyers, a decision of "ingenuity and forethought" on the part of Burrell and Navy Minister <a href="John%20Gorton">John Gorton</a>, according to historian <a href="Tom%20Frame%20%28bishop%29">Tom Frame</a>. The CNS and his minister enjoyed a close working relationship; Burrell declared that Gorton "deserves our thanks for his efforts", and Gorton called Burrell "one of the most honest, sincere and most dedicated sailors".

The purchase of the destroyers signalled a shift in reliance for equipment from Britain to the United States that was contrary to prevailing Australian defence policy at the time, particularly in what historian <a href="Jeffrey%20Grey">Jeffrey Grey</a> described as "the most British of the Australian services, the RAN", and provoked pressure from the Royal Navy and UK shipbuilders, which had lobbied for purchase of their . Burrell later declared that the superiority of the US weapons system was a key factor in his preference for the "Adams" design over the County class. On a mission overseas to discuss trends and acquisitions in January 1960, he was rebuffed by Britain's <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Chief of the Defence Staff</a>, Admiral of the Fleet <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Lord Louis Mountbatten</a>, who mistakenly thought him responsible for the imminent dissolution of the RAN's Fleet Air Arm, but warmly welcomed by the US <a href="Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Chief of Naval Operations</a>, Admiral <a href="Arleigh%20Burke">Arleigh Burke</a>. As it happened, Burrell would gain credit for maintaining the integrity of the FAA, and its fixed-wing component remained viable until the early 1980s. He was appointed a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">Queen's Birthday Honours</a>, <a href="London%20Gazette">gazetted</a> on 3 June 1960. In June 1961, he met with his opposite numbers in the <a href="Reg%20Pollard%20%28general%29">Army</a> and <a href="Valston%20Hancock">Air Force</a> at a Chiefs of Staff Committee conference to discuss the necessity of Australia acquiring nuclear weapons; the chiefs agreed that the probability such a capability would be required was remote but that it should remain an option under certain circumstances, a position the defence forces maintained during the ensuing decade.

Burrell made his farewell to the Australian Fleet aboard HMAS "Melbourne" at Jervis Bay on 8 February 1962. He left the Navy on 23 February, and was succeeded as CNS by Vice Admiral <a href="Hastings%20Harrington">Hastings Harrington</a>. Burrell retired to "Illogan Park", his property near <a href="Braidwood%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Braidwood</a> in the <a href="Southern%20Tablelands">Southern Tablelands</a> of New South Wales. His son Stuart followed him into the Royal Australian Naval College in 1963. In retirement Burrell enjoyed horse racing both as a gambler and as the owner of several successful mounts. During the 1960s, he was also a member of the ACT Regional Selection Committee of the <a href="Winston%20Churchill%20Memorial%20Trusts">Winston Churchill Memorial Trusts</a>.

Burrell suffered a serious <a href="Myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a> in 1980, having been diagnosed with cardiac problems shortly after his retirement from the Navy. His wife Ada died in August the following year. In 1986, Burrell published his memoirs as "Mermaids Do Exist: The Autobiography of Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Burrell", reflecting on what he described as a "lucky" career, and offering his thoughts on maritime strategy. He died on 9 February 1988 in <a href="Canberra%20Hospital">Woden Valley Hospital</a>. Survived by his three children, Sir Henry Burrell was buried in <a href="Gungahlin">Gungahlin</a>, Australian Capital Territory, following a private funeral. The Burrell Cup <a href="doubles%20tennis">doubles tennis</a> trophy, established by the admiral in 1955, completed its fifty-eighth year of competition in March 2013.

John Lerew

John Margrave Lerew, <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">DFC</a> (20 August 1912 – 24 February 1996) was an officer and pilot in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) during World War II, and later a senior manager in the <a href="International%20Civil%20Aviation%20Organization">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO). As commander of <a href="No.%2024%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 24 Squadron</a>, based in <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a>, he became famous in the annals of Air Force history for his irreverent response to orders by headquarters in Australia during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rabaul%20%281942%29">Battle of Rabaul</a> in January 1942. After his squadron was directed to assist in repelling the invading Japanese fleet with its one serviceable bomber, and to keep its damaged airfield open, Lerew signalled headquarters with the ancient <a href="Latin">Latin</a> phrase supposedly used by <a href="gladiator">gladiator</a>s honouring their <a href="Roman%20Emperor">Emperor</a>: ""<a href="Ave%20Imperator%2C%20morituri%20te%20salutant">Morituri vos salutamus</a>"" ("We who are about to die salute you"). He also defied an order to abandon his staff, and organised their escape from Rabaul.

In February 1942, Lerew led a low-level bombing raid on enemy shipping in <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> that set two vessels on fire. He was shot down but managed to evade capture, and returned to safety nine days after being reported missing. Awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a>, he subsequently commanded the RAAF's first flying safety directorate. After leaving the Air Force in 1946 as a <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a>, Lerew took up a position with the newly formed ICAO in Canada. He was responsible for several of its administrative and technical reforms, and rose to Chief of Flight Branch in 1969. Retiring from ICAO in 1972, he travelled extensively before settling in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, where he died in 1996 at the age of eighty-three.

Born in <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Victoria">Hamilton</a>, Victoria, Lerew was the son of William Margrave Lerew, a chemist and veterinary surgeon who had emigrated from England with his two brothers. The family was of French "<a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a>" extraction, the original name being "Le Roux". John Lerew was educated at <a href="Scotch%20College%2C%20Melbourne">Scotch College, Melbourne</a>, where he was a member of the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Cadets">cadets</a>. He studied part-time for a bachelor's degree in <a href="civil%20engineering">civil engineering</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a>, concurrently serving approximately two years in the <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">militia</a> with various units including the <a href="39th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">39th Battalion</a>, <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">3rd Division</a> Artillery Survey Unit, and <a href="Melbourne%20University%20Regiment">Melbourne University Regiment</a>. He also developed a love of fast cars, joining a racing team and placing third in the 1930 <a href="Australian%20Grand%20Prix">Australian Grand Prix</a>.

On 19 November 1932, Lerew enlisted as an air cadet in the RAAF active reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF). He had marched into <a href="Victoria%20Barracks%2C%20Melbourne">Victoria Barracks</a> on a whim and asked to see the person in charge of Air Force recruiting. He was shown to the office of Squadron Leader <a href="Raymond%20Brownell">Raymond Brownell</a>, also a former Scotch College boy, who admitted him. Lerew undertook flying instruction on the 1933 'B' course conducted by <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Station Laverton</a>, and was commissioned a <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> on 1 April. He transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force on 20 May 1935, following graduation from university, and was promoted <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> on 1 July. Posted to <a href="No.%201%20Aircraft%20Depot%20RAAF">No. 1 Aircraft Depot</a>, he was raised to probationary <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> in 1936. The rank became substantive the following year, when he was appointed Staff Officer Directorate of Works and Buildings at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, responsible for selection and improvement of airfield sites.

Lerwe was still based in Melbourne when World War II broke out in September 1939. He was promoted <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> in June 1940, and the same month took charge of No. 1 Aircraft Park in <a href="Geelong%2C%20Victoria">Geelong</a>. One of his initial tasks was to test fly the first <a href="Fairey%20Battle">Fairey Battle</a> single-engined light bomber assembled in Australia. He was posted to <a href="No.%202%20Aircraft%20Depot%20RAAF">No. 2 Aircraft Depot</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a>, New South Wales, in September 1940, and shortly afterwards undertook a survey of the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> and the island of <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a>, including its capital <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a>. Lerew was given command of <a href="No.%2024%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 24 Squadron</a> in May 1941, and raised to temporary <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> in October.

No. 24 Squadron's complement in November 1941 consisted of one Fairey Battle, three <a href="De%20Havilland%20Moth%20Minor">De Havilland Moth Minor</a> biplane <a href="trainer%20%28aircraft%29">trainers</a>, five <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a> twin-engined light bombers, and eleven <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">CAC Wirraway</a> monoplane trainers. The two-seat Wirraways were expected to be employed in operations as <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a>, but were suitable for such a role "only in the minds of the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Air Board</a>", in the words of RAAF historian Alan Stephens. On 1 December, RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne put Lerew's squadron on notice for deployment to Rabaul as an advance garrison in the defence of northern Australia.
No. 24 Squadron's Hudsons began moving to <a href="Vunakanau">Vunakanau</a> airfield, Rabaul, from <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Townsville">RAAF Station Townsville</a> in far-north <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> on 5 December 1941. By the middle of the month they had been joined by the unit's Wirraways. Vunakanau afforded little shelter for staff or aircraft, and Japanese <a href="aerial%20reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> planes were already active in the vicinity, suggesting an attack was imminent. No. 24 Squadron began carrying out reconnaissance missions with its Hudsons, and on one occasion attempted to bomb an enemy ship without success. RAAF Headquarters threatened to relieve Lerew for his apparent lack of results and delays in communications, and demanded to know his excuses. Possessed of what the <a href="Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201939%E2%80%931945">official history</a> of the RAAF in World War II described as an "impish irreverence", Lerew listed among his reasons "disappointment in the lack of assistance rendered by the Almighty". He later reported that he was being caused "more worry" by his own headquarters in "the south than from the enemy situated in the north".
No. 24 Squadron's strength at the beginning of 1942 was four Hudsons, six Wirraways, and 130 staff. On New Year's Day, Lerew led the Hudsons on a raid against <a href="Kapingamarangi">Kapingamarangi Island</a>, igniting a fuel dump that was still burning when the squadron returned to follow up the attack two days later. During 4–7 January, Vunakanau airfield suffered four raids by unescorted Japanese bombers, destroying all but one of the Hudsons. Although the Wirraways were scrambled to intercept attackers on several occasions, their rate of climb was so poor that only once did one of them manage to engage an enemy <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a>, without result; this action, on 6 January, was the first <a href="aerial%20warfare">air-to-air combat</a> between RAAF and Japanese forces. At this point, Lerew signalled headquarters for six "modern fighters" with which to defend his airfield; none were forthcoming.

Squadron Leader <a href="Tyndall%23Australian%20Tindals">Arch Tindal</a>, <a href="Northern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Northern Area Command</a> Armaments Officer, added his weight to Lerew's pleas for modern aircraft. Tindal had arrived to inspect No. 24 Squadron in the middle of an enemy attack on 3 January, and immediately leapt into the nearest Wirraway to attempt an interception. He later submitted a report to headquarters at Townsville, echoing Lerew's concerns regarding the Wirraway's capabilities and warning that "Rabaul is now wide open to bombing attack". Despite this, morale remained high in the unit; Lerew remarked on the devil-may-care attitude of his personnel, who frequently waited until the last moment to take cover during air raids. On 17 January, Lerew was able to gain sufficient height in his Wirraway to confront a Japanese seaplane in a head-on attack, but his <a href=".303%20British">.303</a> machine-gun ammunition was not sufficient to bring it down. In 1956, while at a conference in Tokyo, he coincidentally met the Japanese plane's pilot, who informed him that his lone assault had damaged an engine and killed two crewmen, adding that Lerew was "the bravest enemy I ever faced".

On 20 January, a force of over 100 Japanese aircraft, comprising bombers, dive bombers and fighter escort, converged on Rabaul. It was led by Commander <a href="Mitsuo%20Fuchida">Mitsuo Fuchida</a>, who had controlled the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> on 7 December 1941. Two patrolling Wirraways of No. 24 Squadron attacked the first wave of Japanese raiders. Lerew's six remaining Wirraways then scrambled, one crashing on take-off. Of the seven that were airborne, three were shot down into the sea by <a href="A6M%20Zero">Mitsubishi Zero</a> fighters, two others crash landed with severe damage, one escaped with minor damage, and one remained unscathed. The ten-minute action killed six RAAF aircrew and wounded five. An Australian soldier on the ground later recalled, "We sat at our guns, shocked by the massacre we had just observed". The Japanese fighters compounded the humiliation by executing <a href="aerobatics">aerobatics</a> over the bombed airfield. Lerew signalled headquarters, "Two Wirraways useless defence. Will you now please send some fighters?", receiving the reply, "Regret inability to supply fighters. If we had them you would get them." The next day he was ordered to attack the approaching Japanese fleet with "all available aircraft". As his two serviceable Wirraways had no bomb racks, this left only the one remaining Hudson with which to execute the order; it duly took off to search for the enemy ships but was unable to locate them by nightfall, and returned to base.

It was following a further directive from headquarters on 21 January 1942 to keep his airfield "open", that Lerew, after discussion with his intelligence staff, sent the signal that made him famous: ""Morituri vos salutamus"". The message flummoxed headquarters, until an officer familiar with <a href="Latin">Latin</a> decoded it as the legendary phrase used by ancient <a href="gladiator">gladiator</a>s to honour their <a href="Roman%20Emperor">Emperor</a>: "We who are about to die salute you!" Lerew also chose to ignore two other orders received from headquarters, firstly to turn his remaining ground staff and aircrew into infantrymen to assist with the army's defence and secondly to leave Rabaul in his remaining Hudson to take command of a new squadron in <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a>, New Guinea. To the first order he replied that trained RAAF crews would be more valuable in future actions than in a last-ditch effort to repel the invader at Rabaul; to the second he simply turned a "blind eye", refusing to escape alone in the only aircraft left that could evacuate his personnel. On 22 January, he sent off ninety-six staff in the Hudson and in <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a>s called in from Port Moresby. Others escaped overland or in boats; Lerew's careful planning helped ensure that only three of his men were captured by the Japanese.

Following the evacuation of Rabaul, Lerew took command of a composite squadron in Port Moresby which later became <a href="No.%2032%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 32 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron</a>. On 11 February 1942, he led a flight of three Hudsons in a raid on <a href="Gasmata">Gasmata</a> harbour, making what the official history of the RAAF in World War II described as "the first mast-height attack on enemy shipping in the <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>". Having set two ships on fire, the Hudsons were attacked by enemy fighters and two were shot down, including Lerew's. With his aircraft in flames, he ordered his crew to bail out of the rear hatch while he parachuted from the front window. Lerew landed in the jungle and narrowly avoided capture before making his way to a <a href="Coastwatchers">Coastwatcher</a> post and returning to Port Moresby in a <a href="schooner">schooner</a>, nine days after having been posted missing; his crew members had died. On 7 April, Lerew was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> for "outstanding courage, determination, skill and tenacity in the course of bombing raids on enemy positions in New Britain". The success of the Gasmata operation prompted the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> to commend Lerew's squadron for the "effort required by both crews and ground personnel owing to our small numbers and general condition".
Returning to Australia, Lerew held various base commands including RAAF Station Townsville, <a href="HMAS%20Albatross%20%28air%20station%29">RAAF Station Nowra</a> in New South Wales, and <a href="Batchelor%20Airfield">Batchelor Airfield</a> near <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Northern Territory. He led <a href="No.%207%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 7 Squadron</a>, operating <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a>s out of first Nowra and then Townsville, from August to December 1942. He then returned to RAAF Station Laverton to take charge of No. 1 Aircraft Depot (No. 1 AD). Lerew's biographer, Lex McAulay, speculated of this quick succession of postings across the country: "...it is easy to assume that this Wing Commander whose critical reports were seen by the War Cabinet, and who had twice escaped the enemy at close quarters, was not to be allowed personal contact with the media of the day until his experiences were no longer topical and were overtaken by more recent momentous events". Though degree-qualified in civil engineering, Lerew believed he was underused in the technical environment of No. 1 AD, and sought another overseas posting. Nevertheless, his tenure at Laverton helped prepare him for his later flying safety work. In September 1943, he investigated the crash of a <a href="Vultee%20A-31%20Vengeance">Vultee Vengeance</a> flown by an experienced aviator, and found that when rolling the aircraft to the right it was possible for the pilot's movements to release his safety harness, making it impossible for him to remain in his seat and control the aircraft. Lerew designed and developed a clip to prevent a recurrence of this mishap, which was later adopted worldwide for all such harnesses.

Lerew was posted to RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London, in December 1943. He travelled via the United States, meeting film stars <a href="Bing%20Crosby">Bing Crosby</a>, <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a>, and <a href="Dorothy%20Lamour">Dorothy Lamour</a> on the set of "<a href="Road%20to%20Utopia">Road to Utopia</a>" at <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> in February 1944. In London, he undertook study of RAF and USAAF methods of operations, as well as diplomatic duties. Of the <a href="Operation%20Overlord">invasion of France</a> on 6 June 1944, he wrote: "There has been no rejoicing. A hushed quietness has descended over London and all of England. Most people have relatives in it, and there is only one wish: that is, that it will end quickly. It is depressing to be playing no part in it." Later in the year, Lerew was <a href="Investiture">invested</a> with his Distinguished Flying Cross by <a href="George%20VI%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George VI</a> at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>. He returned to Australia in early 1945, and married Laurie Steele, the Australian-born widow of a <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> <a href="night-fighter">night-fighter</a> pilot, having met her when he was stationed in England. The couple had two daughters, but eventually divorced. In March, Lerew took part in the investigation into the crash of a Hudson carrying Major General <a href="George%20Alan%20Vasey">George Vasey</a>; he determined that the pilot's lack of experience in instrument flying had been a factor, and recommended further such training for RAAF flight crew. Promoted group captain, he formed the Directorate of Flying Safety in June 1945 and served as its inaugural Director. Believing that the promotion of flying safety in the RAAF cut across both administrative and operational spheres, and aware of the <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29%23Divided%20command">notorious feud</a> between the service's two senior officers, Air Vice Marshals <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a> and <a href="William%20Bostock">Bill Bostock</a>, Lerew had proposed that the new directorate be placed squarely under the auspices of Jones as Chief of the Air Staff, with authority to demand free access to information from all other directorates.

Dubious about the prospects for advancement in the post-war military, Lerew applied for a role in the recently established Provisional <a href="International%20Civil%20Aviation%20Organization">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (PICAO) in March 1946, while still Director of Flying Safety in the RAAF. He had just been appointed <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western Area</a> in Darwin on 7 October 1946 when PICAO offered him the position of Technical Officer, which he accepted. He left the RAAF on 8 November 1946, emigrating to <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, Quebec, Canada, to take up his new employment with PICAO, which became ICAO in 1947. Appointed Chief of Aerodromes, Air Routes and Ground Aids Section in January 1951, he conducted assessments of airfields throughout the world, and led the team that recommended <a href="Ellinikon%20International%20Airport">Hellinikon</a> be developed as Athens' international airport. Lerew received credit for several of ICAO's accomplishments over the next decade, including various administrative reforms within the organisation and finalising a standard runway approach lighting system in 1953 following five years of disagreement among members. A colleague remembered him as having "that very fortunate duality of personality, being serious, efficient and knowledgeable in his official capacity, with an equally inherent twin ability to really liven things up off-duty".

In Mexico on 20 August 1966, Lerew married Josephine Henriette Oude Reimerink, a Dutch national he had met three years earlier. He was promoted ICAO's Chief of Flight Branch in April 1969, in which capacity he served until retiring from the organisation in 1972. In retirement, Lerew and his wife restored houses and travelled extensively. Their expeditions resulted in two narrow escapes, in December 1974 when they tired of the oppressively humid weather in Darwin and left just before <a href="Cyclone%20Tracy">Cyclone Tracy</a> struck on <a href="Christmas%20Day">Christmas Day</a>, and in February 1976 when they decided to camp well away from <a href="Lago%20de%20Atitl%C3%A1n">Lake Atitlan</a>, Guatemala, which was devastated soon after by an <a href="1976%20Guatemala%20earthquake">earthquake that left over 22,000 people dead</a>. The couple eventually settled in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, where John Lerew died of <a href="cancer">cancer</a> on 24 February 1996, aged eighty-three. He was survived by Josephine and the children of his first marriage.

Andalusian horse

The Andalusian, also known as the Pure Spanish Horse or PRE (), is a <a href="horse%20breed">horse breed</a> from the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, where its ancestors have lived for thousands of years. The Andalusian has been recognized as an distinct breed since the 15th century, and its <a href="Equine%20conformation">conformation</a> has changed very little over the centuries. Throughout its history, it has been known for its prowess as a <a href="horses%20in%20warfare">war horse</a>, and was prized by the nobility. The breed was used as a tool of diplomacy by the Spanish government, and kings across Europe rode and owned Spanish horses. During the 19th century, warfare, disease and <a href="crossbreed">crossbreed</a>ing reduced herd numbers dramatically, and despite some recovery in the late 19th century, the trend continued into the early 20th century. Exports of Andalusians from Spain were restricted until the 1960s, but the breed has since spread throughout the world, despite their low population. In 2010, there were more than 185,000 registered Andalusians worldwide.

Strongly built, and compact yet elegant, Andalusians have long, thick manes and tails. Their most common <a href="equine%20coat%20color">coat color</a> is <a href="gray%20%28horse%29">gray</a>, although they can be found in many other colors. They are known for their intelligence, sensitivity and docility. A sub-strain within the breed known as the Carthusian, is considered by breeders to be the purest strain of Andalusian, though there is no genetic evidence for this claim. The strain is still considered separate from the main breed however, and is preferred by breeders because buyers pay more for horses of Carthusian bloodlines. There are several competing <a href="breed%20registry">registries</a> keeping records of horses designated as Andalusian or PRE, but they differ on their definition of the Andalusian and PRE, the purity of various strains of the breed, and the legalities of <a href="breed%20registry">stud book</a> ownership. At least one lawsuit is in progress , to determine the ownership of the Spanish PRE stud book.

The Andalusian is closely related to the <a href="Lusitano">Lusitano</a> of Portugal, and has been used to develop many other breeds, especially in Europe and the Americas. <a href="List%20of%20horse%20breeds">Breeds</a> with Andalusian ancestry include many of the <a href="warmblood">warmblood</a>s in Europe as well as <a href="western%20hemisphere">western hemisphere</a> breeds such as the <a href="Azteca%20%28horse%29">Azteca</a>. Over its centuries of development, the Andalusian breed has been selected for athleticism and stamina. The horses were originally used for <a href="classical%20dressage">classical dressage</a>, <a href="driving%20%28horse%29">driving</a>, <a href="bullfighting">bullfighting</a>, and as <a href="stock%20horse">stock horse</a>s. Modern Andalusians are used for many <a href="equestrianism">equestrian</a> activities, including <a href="dressage">dressage</a>, <a href="show%20jumping">show jumping</a> and driving. The breed is also used extensively in movies, especially historical pictures and fantasy epics.

Andalusians <a href="stallion%20%28horse%29">stallions</a> and <a href="gelding">gelding</a>s average at the <a href="withers">withers</a> and in weight; <a href="mare%20%28horse%29">mares</a> average and . The Spanish government has set the minimum height for registration in Spain at for males and for mares — this standard is followed by the Association of Purebred Spanish Horse Breeders of Spain ("Asociación Nacional de Criadores de Caballo de Pura Raza Española" or ANCCE) and the Andalusian Horse Association of Australasia. The Spanish legislation also requires that in order for animals to be approved as either "qualified" or "élite" breeding stock, stallions must stand at least and mares at least .

Andalusian horses are elegant and strongly built. Members of the breed have heads of medium length, with a straight or slightly convex profile. Ultra convex and concave profiles are discouraged in the breed, and are penalized in breed shows. Necks are long and broad, running to well-defined <a href="withers">withers</a> and a massive chest. They have a short back and broad, strong hindquarters with a well-rounded <a href="rump%20%28animal%29">croup</a>. The breed tends to have clean legs, with no propensity for blemishes or injuries, and energetic <a href="horse%20gaits">gaits</a>. The mane and tail are thick and long, but the legs do not have excess <a href="Feathering%20%28horse%29">feathering</a>. Andalusians tend to be docile, while remaining intelligent and sensitive. When treated with respect they are quick to learn, responsive, and cooperative.

There are two additional characteristics unique to the Carthusian strain, believed to trace back to the strain's <a href="foundation%20bloodstock">foundation stallion</a> Esclavo. The first is warts under the tail, a trait which Esclavo passed to his offspring, and a trait which some breeders felt was necessary to prove that a horse was a member of the Esclavo bloodline. The second characteristic is the occasional presence of "horns", which are frontal <a href="wikt%3Aboss%23Noun">bosses</a>, possibly inherited from Asian ancestors. The physical descriptions of the bosses vary, ranging from <a href="calcium">calcium</a>-like deposits at the <a href="temple%20%28anatomy%29">temple</a> to small horn-like protuberances near or behind the ear. However, these "horns" are not considered proof of Esclavo descent, unlike the tail warts.

In the past, most <a href="equine%20coat%20color">coat colors</a> were found, including spotted patterns. Today most Andalusians are gray or bay; in the US, around 80 percent of all Andalusians are <a href="gray%20%28horse%29">gray</a>. Of the remaining horses, approximately 15 percent are <a href="bay%20%28horse%29">bay</a> and 5 percent are <a href="black%20%28horse%29">black</a>, <a href="dun%20gene">dun</a> or <a href="palomino">palomino</a> or <a href="chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnut</a>. Other colors, such as <a href="Buckskin%20%28horse%29">buckskin</a>, <a href="perlino">pearl</a>, and <a href="cremello">cremello</a>, are rare, but are recognized as allowed colors by registries for the breed.

In the early history of the breed, certain <a href="horse%20markings">white markings</a> and <a href="Hair%20whorl%20%28horse%29">whorls</a> were considered to be indicators of character and good or bad luck. Horses with white socks on their feet were considered to have good or bad luck, depending on the leg or legs marked. A horse with no white markings at all was considered to be ill-tempered and vice-ridden, while certain facial markings were considered representative of honesty, loyalty and endurance. Similarly, hair whorls in various places were considered to show good or bad luck, with the most unlucky being in places where the horse could not see them – for example the temples, cheek, shoulder or heart. Two whorls near the root of the tail were considered a sign of courage and good luck.

The movement of Andalusian horses is extended, elevated, cadenced and harmonious, with a balance of roundness and forward movement. Poor elevation, irregular tempo, and excessive winging (sideways movement of the legs from the knee down) are discouraged by breed registry standards. Andalusians are known for their agility and their ability to learn difficult moves quickly, such as advanced <a href="Collection%20%28horse%29">collection</a> and turns on the haunches. A 2001 study compared the <a href="kinematic">kinematic</a> characteristics of Andalusian, Arabian and <a href="Anglo-Arabian">Anglo-Arabian</a> horses while moving at the <a href="trot%20%28horse%20gait%29">trot</a>. Andalusians were found to overtrack less (the degree to which the hind foot lands ahead of the front hoof print) but also exhibit greater flexing of both fore and hind joints, movement consistent with the more elevated way of <a href="horse%20gaits">going</a> typically found in this breed. The authors of the study theorized that these characteristics of the breed's trot may contribute to their success as a riding and dressage horse.

A 2008 study found that Andalusians experience <a href="ischaemic">ischaemic</a> (reduced blood flow) diseases of the <a href="small%20intestine">small intestine</a> at a rate significantly higher than other breeds; and <a href="stallions">stallions</a> had higher numbers of <a href="inguinal%20hernia">inguinal hernia</a>s, with risk for occurrence 30 times greater than other breeds. At the same time, they also showed a lower incidence of <a href="large%20intestine">large intestinal</a> obstruction. In the course of the study, Andalusians also showed the highest risk of <a href="laminitis">laminitis</a> as a <a href="Complication%20%28medicine%29">medical complication</a> related to the intestinal issues.

The Andalusian horse is descended from the <a href="Iberian%20horse">Iberian horse</a>s of Spain and Portugal, and derives its name from its place of origin, the Spanish region of <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>. Cave paintings show that horses have been present on the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a> as far back as 20,000 to 30,000 BCE. Although Portuguese historian Ruy d'Andrade hypothesized that the ancient <a href="Sorraia">Sorraia</a> breed was an ancestor of the Southern Iberian breeds, including the Andalusian, genetic studies using <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> show that the Sorraia is part of a <a href="genetic%20cluster">genetic cluster</a> that is largely separated from most Iberian breeds.

Throughout history, the Iberian breeds have been influenced by many different peoples and cultures who occupied Spain, including the <a href="Celts">Celts</a>, the <a href="Carthaginians">Carthaginians</a>, the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a>, various <a href="Germanic%20tribes">Germanic tribes</a> and the <a href="Moors">Moors</a>. The Iberian horse was identified as a talented <a href="horses%20in%20warfare">war horse</a> as early as 450 BCE. <a href="Mitochondrial%20DNA">Mitochondrial DNA</a> studies of the modern Andalusian horse of the <a href="Iberian%20peninsula">Iberian peninsula</a> and <a href="Barb%20%28horse%29">Barb</a> horse of <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a> present convincing evidence that both breeds crossed the <a href="Strait%20of%20Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</a> and were used for breeding with each other, influencing one another's bloodlines. Thus, the Andalusian may have been the first European "warmblood", a mixture of heavy European and lighter <a href="Oriental%20horse">Oriental horse</a>s. Some of the earliest written <a href="pedigree%20chart">pedigrees</a> in recorded European history were kept by <a href="Carthusian">Carthusian</a> monks, beginning in the 13th century. Because they could read and write, and were thus able to maintain careful records, <a href="monastic">monastic</a>s were given the responsibility for horse breeding by certain members of the nobility, particularly in Spain. Andalusian <a href="stud%20farm">stud farm</a>s for breeding were formed in the late 15th century in Carthusian monasteries in <a href="Jerez%20de%20la%20Frontera">Jerez</a>, <a href="Seville">Seville</a> and <a href="Cazalla%20de%20la%20Sierra">Cazalla</a>.

The Carthusians bred powerful, weight-bearing horses in Andalusia for the <a href="Crown%20of%20Castile">Crown of Castile</a>, using the finest <a href="Jennet">Spanish Jennets</a> as <a href="foundation%20bloodstock">foundation bloodstock</a>. These horses were a blend of Jennet and <a href="warmblood">warmblood</a> breeding, taller and more powerfully built than the original Jennet. By the 15th century, the Andalusian had become a distinct breed, and was being used to influence the development of other breeds. They were also noted for their use as <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a> horses. Even though in the 16th and 17th centuries Spanish horses had not reached the final form of the modern Andalusian, by 1667 <a href="William%20Cavendish%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Newcastle-upon-Tyne">William Cavendish</a>, the <a href="Duke%20of%20Newcastle">Duke of Newcastle</a>, called the Spanish horse of Andalusia the "princes" of the horse world, and reported that they were "unnervingly intelligent". The Iberian horse became known as the "royal horse of Europe" and was seen at many royal courts and riding academies, including those in Austria, Italy, France and Germany. By the 16th century, during the reigns of <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V</a> (1500–1558) and <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Phillip II</a> (1556–1581), Spanish horses were considered the finest in the world. Even in Spain, quality horses were owned mainly by the wealthy. During the 16th century, inflation and an increased demand for harness and cavalry horses drove the price of horses extremely high. The always expensive Andalusian became even more so, and it was often impossible to find a member of the breed to purchase at any price.

Spanish horses also were spread widely as a tool of diplomacy by the government of Spain, which granted both horses and export rights to favored citizens and to other royalty. As early as the 15th century, the Spanish horse was widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean, and was known in northern European countries, despite being less common and more expensive there. As time went on, kings from across Europe, including every French monarch from <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">Francis I</a> to <a href="Louis%20XVI">Louis XVI</a>, had equestrian <a href="portrait">portrait</a>s created showing themselves riding Spanish-type horses. The kings of France, including <a href="Louis%20XIII">Louis XIII</a> and <a href="Louis%20XIV">Louis XIV</a>, especially preferred the Spanish horse; the head groom to <a href="Henri%20IV">Henri IV</a>, Salomon de la Broue, said in 1600, "Comparing the best horses, I give the Spanish horse first place for its perfection, because it is the most beautiful, noble, graceful and courageous". War horses from Spain and Portugal began to be introduced to England in the 12th century, and importation continued through the 15th century. In the 16th century, <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> received gifts of Spanish horses from Charles V, <a href="Ferdinand%20II%20of%20Aragon">Ferdinand II of Aragon</a> and the <a href="Duke%20of%20Savoy">Duke of Savoy</a> and others when he wed <a href="Katherine%20of%20Aragon">Katherine of Aragon</a>. He also purchased additional war and riding horses through agents in Spain. By 1576, Spanish horses made up one third of British royal studs at <a href="Malmesbury">Malmesbury</a> and <a href="Tutbury">Tutbury</a>. The Spanish horse peaked in popularity in Great Britain during the 17th century, when horses were freely imported from Spain and exchanged as gifts between royal families. With the introduction of the <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a>, interest in the Spanish horse faded after the mid-18th century, although they remained popular through the early 19th century. The <a href="Conquistador">Conquistador</a>s of the 16th century rode Spanish horses, particularly animals from Andalusia, and the modern Andalusian descended from similar bloodstock. By 1500, Spanish horses were established in studs on <a href="Santo%20Domingo">Santo Domingo</a>, and Spanish horses made their way into the ancestry of many breeds founded in North and South America. Many Spanish explorers from the 16th century on brought Spanish horses with them for use as war horses and later as breeding stock. By 1642, the Spanish horse had spread to <a href="Moldavia">Moldovia</a>, to the stables of <a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>n prince <a href="George%20I%20R%C3%A1k%C3%B3czi">George Rakoczi</a>.

Despite their ancient history, all living Andalusians trace to a small number of horses bred by religious orders in the 18th and 19th centuries. An influx of <a href="draft%20horse">heavy horse</a> blood beginning in the 16th century, resulted in the dilution of many of the bloodlines; only those protected by selective breeding remained intact to become the modern Andalusian. During the 19th century, the Andalusian breed was threatened because many horses were stolen or requisitioned in wartime, including the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Oranges">War of the Oranges</a>, the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a> and the three <a href="Carlist%20Wars">Carlist Wars</a>. <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s invading army also stole many horses. One herd of Andalusians was hidden from the invaders however, and subsequently used to renew the breed. In 1822, breeders began to add <a href="Anglo-Norman%20horse">Norman</a> blood into Spanish bloodlines, as well as further infusions of <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian</a> blood. This was partially because increasing mechanization and changing needs within the military called for horses with more speed in cavalry charges as well as horses with more bulk for pulling gun carriages. In 1832, an epidemic seriously affected Spain's horse population, from which only one small herd survived in a stud at the monastery in <a href="La%20Cartuja">Cartuja</a>. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, European breeders, especially the Germans, changed from an emphasis on Andalusian and <a href="Neapolitan%20horse">Neapolitan</a> horses (an emphasis that had been in place since the decline of <a href="chivalry">chivalry</a>), to an emphasis on the breeding of <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a>s and <a href="warmblood">warmblood</a>s, further depleting the stock of Andalusians. Despite this change in focus, Andalusian breeding slowly recovered, and in 1869, the Seville Horse Fair (originally begun by the Romans), played host to between ten and twelve thousand Spanish horses. In the early 20th century, Spanish horse breeding began to focus on other breeds, particularly <a href="draft%20horse">draft breeds</a>, Arabians, Thoroughbreds and crosses between these breeds, as well as crosses between these breeds and the Andalusian. The purebred Andalusian was not viewed favorably by breeders or the military, and their numbers decreased significantly.
Andalusians only began to be exported from Spain in 1962. The first Andalusians were imported into Australia in 1971, and in 1973 the Andalusian Horse Association of Australasia was formed for the registration of these Andalusians and their offspring. Strict quarantine guidelines prohibited the importation of new Andalusian blood to Australia for many years, but since 1999, regulations have been relaxed and more than half a dozen new horses have been imported. Bloodines in the United States also rely on imported stock, and all American Andalusians can be traced directly to the stud books in Portugal and Spain. There are around 8,500 animals in the United States, where the International Andalusian and Lusitano Horse Association (IALHA) registers around 700 new purebred foals every year. These numbers indicate that the Andalusian is a relatively rare breed in the United States. In 2003, there were 75,389 horses registered in the stud book, and they constituted almost 66 percent of the horses in Spain. Breed numbers have been increasing during the 21st century. At the end of 2010, a total of 185,926 horses were recorded in the database of the Spanish Ministerio de Medio Ambiente, y Medio Rural y Marino. Of these, 28,801 or about 15% were in other countries of the world; of those in Spain, 65,371 or about 42% were in Andalusia.

The Carthusian Andalusian or "Cartujano" is generally considered the purest Andalusian strain, and has one of the oldest recorded pedigree lines in the world. The pure sub-type is rare, as only around 12 percent of the Andalusian horses registered between the founding of the stud book in the 19th century and 1998 were considered Carthusians. They made up only 3.6 percent of the overall breeding stock, but 14.2 percent of the stallions used for breeding. In the past, Carthusians were given preference in breeding, leading to a large proportion of the Andalusian population claiming ancestry from a small number of horses and possibly limiting the breed's <a href="genetic%20variability">genetic variability</a>. A 2005 study compared the <a href="genetic%20distance">genetic distance</a> between Carthusian and non-Carthusian horses. They calculated a <a href="Fixation%20index">Fixation index</a> (F) based on genealogical information and concluded that the distinction between the two is not supported by genetic evidence. However, there are slight physical differences; Carthusians have more "oriental" or concave head shapes and are more often gray in color, while non-Carthusians tend toward convex profiles and more often exhibit other coat colors such as bay.

The Carthusian line was established in the early 18th century when two Spanish brothers, Andrés and Diego Zamora, purchased a <a href="stallion">stallion</a> named El Soldado and bred him to two <a href="mare">mare</a>s. The mares were descended from mares purchased by the Spanish king and placed at <a href="Aranjuez">Aranjuez</a>, one of the oldest horse breeding farms in Spain. One of the offspring of El Soldado, a dark gray <a href="Colt%20%28horse%29">colt</a> named Esclavo, became the foundation sire of the Carthusian line. One group of mares sired by Esclavo in about 1736 were given to a group of Carthusian monks to settle a debt. Other animals of these bloodlines were absorbed into the main Andalusian breed; the stock given to the monks was bred into a special line, known as Zamoranos. Throughout the following centuries, the Zamoranos bloodlines were guarded by the Carthusian monks, to the point of defying royal orders to introduce outside blood from the <a href="Neapolitan%20horse">Neapolitan horse</a> and central European breeds. They did, however, introduce <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian</a> and <a href="Barb%20%28horse%29">Barb</a> blood to improve the strain. The original stock of Carthusians was greatly depleted during the <a href="Peninsular%20Wars">Peninsular Wars</a>, and the strain might have become extinct if not for the efforts of the Zapata family. Today, the Carthusian strain is raised in state-owned <a href="stud%20farm">stud farm</a>s around <a href="Jerez%20de%20la%20Frontera">Jerez de la Frontera</a>, <a href="Badajoz">Badajoz</a> and <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Spain">Cordoba</a>, and also by several private families. Carthusian horses continue to be in demand in Spain, and buyers pay high prices for members of the strain.

Spain's worldwide military activities between the 14th and 17th centuries called for large numbers of horses, more than could be supplied by native Spanish mares. Spanish custom also called for mounted troops to ride <a href="stallion">stallion</a>s, never <a href="mare">mare</a>s or <a href="gelding">gelding</a>s. Due to these factors, Spanish stallions were crossed with local mares in many countries, adding Spanish bloodlines wherever they went, especially to other European breeds.

Because of the influence of the later <a href="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> families, who ruled in both Spain and other nations of Europe, the Andalusian was <a href="crossbred">crossbred</a> with horses of Central Europe and the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a> and thus was closely related to many breeds that developed, including the <a href="Neapolitan%20horse">Neapolitan horse</a>, <a href="Groningen%20Horse">Groningen</a>, <a href="Lipizzaner">Lipizzaner</a> and <a href="Kladruber">Kladruber</a>. Spanish horses have been used extensively in classical dressage in Germany since the 16th century. They thus influenced many German breeds, including the <a href="Hanoverian%20%28horse%29">Hanoverian</a>, <a href="Holstein%20%28horse%29">Holstein</a>, <a href="East%20Friesian%20%28horse%29">East Friesian</a> and <a href="Oldenburg">Oldenburg</a>. Dutch breeds such as the <a href="Friesian%20horse">Friesian</a> and <a href="Gelderland%20%28horse%29">Gelderland</a> also contain significant Spanish blood, as do Danish breeds such as the <a href="Frederiksborg%20horse">Frederiksborg</a> and <a href="Knabstrupper">Knabstrupper</a>.

Andalusians were a significant influence on the creation of the <a href="Alter%20Real">Alter Real</a>, a strain of the <a href="Lusitano">Lusitano</a>, and the <a href="Azteca%20%28horse%29">Azteca</a>, a Mexican breed created by crossing the Andalusian with <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse">American Quarter Horse</a> and <a href="Criollo%20%28horse%29">Criollo</a> bloodlines. The Spanish jennet ancestors of the Andalusian also developed the <a href="Colonial%20Spanish%20Horse">Colonial Spanish Horse</a> in America, which became the foundation bloodstock for many North and South American breeds. The Andalusian has also been used to create breeds more recently, with breed associations for both the <a href="Warlander">Warlander</a> (an Andalusian/Friesian cross) and the <a href="Spanish-Norman%20horse">Spanish-Norman</a> (an Andalusian/<a href="Percheron%20horse">Percheron</a> cross) being established in the 1990s.

Until modern times, horse breeds throughout Europe were known primarily by the name of the region where they were bred. Thus the original term "Andalusian" simply described the horses of distinct quality that came from <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a> in Spain. Similarly, the <a href="Lusitano">Lusitano</a>, a Portuguese horse very similar to the Andalusian, takes its name from "<a href="Lusitania">Lusitania</a>", an ancient Roman name for Portugal.

The Andalusian horse has been known historically as the Iberian Saddle Horse, Iberian War Horse, Spanish Horse, Portuguese, Peninsular, Extremeño, Villanos, Zapata, Zamoranos, Castilian, and <a href="Jennet">Jennet</a>. The Portuguese name refers to what is now the Lusitano, while the Peninsular, Iberian Saddle Horse and Iberian War Horse names refer to horses from the Iberian Peninsula as a whole. The Extremeño name refers to Spanish horses from the <a href="Extremadura">Extremadura</a> province of Spain and the Zapata or Zapatero name to horses that come from the Zapata family stud. The Villano name has occasionally been applied to modern Andalusians, but originally referred to heavy, crossbred horses from the mountains north of <a href="Ja%C3%A9n%2C%20Spain">Jaen</a>. The Carthusian horse, also known as the Carthusian-Andalusian and the Cartujano, is a sub-type of the Andalusian, rather than a distinct breed in itself. A common nickname for the Andalusian is the "Horse of Kings". Some sources state that the Andalusian and the Lusitano are genetically the same, differing only in the country of origin of individual horses.
In many areas today, the breeding, showing, and registration of the Andalusian and Lusitano are controlled by the same <a href="breed%20registry">registries</a>. One example of this is the International Andalusian and Lusitano Horse Association (IALHA), claimed to have the largest membership of any Andalusian registering organization. Other organizations, such as The Association of Purebred Spanish Horse Breeders of Spain ( or ANCCE), use the term or PRE to describe the true Spanish horse, and claim sole authority to officially register and issue documentation for PRE Horses, both in Spain and anywhere else in the world. In most of the world the terms "Andalusian" and "PRE" are considered one and the same breed, but the public position of the ANCCE is that terms such as "Andalusian" and "Iberian horse" refer only to crossbreds, which the ANCCE considers to be horses that lack quality and purity, without official documentation or registration from official Spanish Stud Book.

In <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>, the Australasia Andalusian Association registers Andalusians (which the registry considers an interchangeable term for PRE), Australian Andalusians, and partbred Andalusians. They share responsibility for the Purebred Iberian Horse (an Andalusian/Lusitano cross) with the Lusitano Association of Australasia. In the Australian registry, there are various levels of <a href="crossbred">crossbred</a> horses. A first cross Andalusian is a crossbreed that is 50 percent Andalusian, while a second cross Andalusian is the result of crossing a <a href="purebred">purebred</a> Andalusian with a first cross – resulting in a horse of 75 percent Andalusian blood. A third cross, also known by the registry as an Australian Andalusian, is when a second cross individual is mated with a foundation Andalusian mare. This sequence is known as a "breeding up" program by the registry.

The name (PRE), usually rendered in English "Pure Spanish Horse" (not a literal translation) is the term used by the ANCCE, a private organization, and the Ministry of Agriculture of Spain. The ANCCE uses neither the term "Andalusian" nor "Iberian horse", and only registers horses that have certain recognized bloodlines. In addition, all breeding stock must undergo an evaluation process. The ANCCE was founded in 1972. Spain's Ministry of Agriculture recognizes the ANCCE as the representing entity for PRE breeders and owners across the globe, as well as the administrator of the breed stud book. ANCCE functions as the international parent association for all breeders worldwide who record their horses as PRE. For example, the United States PRE association is affiliated with ANCCE, follows ANCCE rules, and has a wholly separate governance system from the IALHA.

A second group, the Foundation for the Pure Spanish Horse or PRE Mundial, has begun another PRE registry as an alternative to the ANCCE. This new registry claims that all of their registered horses trace back to the original stud book maintained by the "Cria Caballar", which was a branch of the Spanish Ministry of Defense, for 100 years. Thus, the PRE Mundial registry asserts that their registry is the most authentic, purest PRE registry functioning today.

, there is a lawsuit in progress to determine the legal holder of the PRE stud book. The Unión de Criadores de Caballos Españoles (UCCE or Union of Spanish Horse Breeders) has brought a case to the highest <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> courts in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, charging that the Ministry of Spain's transfer of the original PRE Libro de Origen (the official <a href="stud%20book">stud book</a>) from the "Cria Caballar" to ANCCE was illegal. In early 2009, the courts decided on behalf of UCCE, explaining that the "Cria Caballar" formed the "Libro de Origin". Because it was formed by a government entity, it is against European Union law for the stud book to be transferred to a private entity, a law that was broken by the transfer of the book to ANCCE, which is a non-governmental organization. The court found that by giving ANCCE sole control of the stud book, Spain's Ministry of Defense was acting in a discriminatory manner. The court held that Spain must give permission to maintain a breed stud book (called a "Libro Genealógico") to any international association or Spanish national association which requests it. Based on the Brussels court decision, an application has been made by the Foundation for the Pure Spanish Horse to maintain the United States stud book for the PRE. , Spain has not revoked ANCCE's right to be the sole holder of the PRE stud book, and has instead reaffirmed the organization's status.

The Andalusian breed has over the centuries been consistently selected for athleticism. In the 17th century, referring to multi-kilometer races, Cavendish said, "They were so much faster than all other horses known at that time that none was ever seen to come close to them, even in the many remarkable races that were run." In 1831, horses at five years old were expected to be able to gallop, without changing pace, four or five leagues, about . By 1925, the Portuguese military expected horses to "cover 40 km over uneven terrain at a minimum speed of 10 km/h, and to gallop a flat course of 8 km at a minimum speed of 800 metres per minute carrying a weight of at least 70 kg", and the Spanish military had similar standards.

From the very beginning of their history, Andalusians have been used for both riding and <a href="driving%20%28horse%29">driving</a>. Among the first horses used for classical dressage, they are still making a mark in international competition in <a href="dressage">dressage</a> today. At the 2002 <a href="World%20Equestrian%20Games">World Equestrian Games</a>, two Andalusians were on the bronze-medal winning Spanish dressage team, a team that went on to take the silver medal at the <a href="2004%20Summer%20Olympics">2004 Summer Olympics</a>. Today, the breed is increasingly being selectively bred for increased aptitude in classical dressage. Historically, however, they were also used as <a href="stock%20horse">stock horse</a>s, especially suited to working with Iberian bulls, known for their aggressive temperaments. They were, and still are, known for their use in mounted <a href="bull%20fighting">bull fighting</a>. Mares were traditionally used for "la trilla", the Spanish process of threshing grain practiced until the 1960s. Mares, some pregnant or with foals at their side, spent full days trotting over the grain. As well as being a traditional farming practice, it also served as a test of endurance, hardiness and willingness for the maternal Andalusian lines.

Andalusians today are used for <a href="show%20jumping">show jumping</a>, <a href="western%20pleasure">western pleasure</a> and many other classes at <a href="horse%20show">horse show</a>s. The current <a href="Traveler%20%28mascot%29">Traveler</a>, the mascot of the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a>, is an Andalusian. The dramatic appearance of the Andalusian horse, with its arched neck, muscular build and energetic gaits, has made it a popular breed to use in film, particularly in historical and fantasy epics. Andalusians have been present in films ranging from "<a href="Gladiator%20%282000%20film%29">Gladiator</a>" to "<a href="Interview%20with%20the%20Vampire%20%28film%29">Interview with the Vampire</a>", and "" to "<a href="Braveheart">Braveheart</a>". The horses have also been seen in such fantasy epics as <a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%20%28film%20series%29">"The Lord of the Rings" film trilogy</a>, "<a href="King%20Arthur%20%282004%20film%29">King Arthur</a>", and "".

Halo: Reach

Halo: Reach is a <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by <a href="Bungie">Bungie</a> and published by <a href="Microsoft%20Studios">Microsoft Game Studios</a> originally for the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> <a href="home%20video%20game%20console">home video game console</a>. The sixth installment in the "<a href="Halo%20%28series%29">Halo</a>" series, and a direct prequel to "", "Reach" was released worldwide in September 2010. The game takes place in the year 2552, where humanity is locked in a war with the alien <a href="Covenant%20%28Halo%29">Covenant</a>. Players control Noble Six, a member of an elite <a href="supersoldier">supersoldier</a> squad, when the human world known as Reach falls under Covenant attack.

After releasing "<a href="Halo%203">Halo 3</a>" in 2007, Bungie split into teams to develop two different games—what would become "" and "Reach". The developers decided to create a prequel to the original "Halo" game trilogy, freeing themselves from the obligation of addressing old story threads. As the game would take place on a human world doomed to be destroyed, they focused on making the environment a character unto itself. Longtime "Halo" composers <a href="Martin%20O%27Donnell">Martin O'Donnell</a> and <a href="Michael%20Salvatori">Michael Salvatori</a> returned to compose "Reach"s music, aiming for a more somber sound to match the story.

"Reach" was announced at the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%202009">Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, and the first in-<a href="game%20engine">engine</a> trailer was shown at the 2009 <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a>. Players who purchased "ODST" were eligible to participate in a "Reach" multiplayer <a href="Video%20game%20development%23Beta">beta</a> in May 2010; the beta allowed Bungie to gain player feedback for fixing <a href="Software%20bug">bugs</a> and making gameplay tweaks before shipping the final version. <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> gave "Reach" its biggest game marketing budget yet and created award-winning live-action commercials, action figures, and interactive media to promote the game.

The game grossed <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>200 million on its launch day, setting a new record for the franchise. "Reach" sold well in most territories, moving more than three million units its first month in North America. Critical reception was positive; reviewers from publications such as "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>", <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, and "<a href="Official%20Xbox%20Magazine">Official Xbox Magazine</a>" called it the best "Halo" title yet. Critics generally praised the game's graphics and sound, but the plot and characters were less positively received. "Reach" was Bungie's final "Halo" game; subsequent games have been overseen by Microsoft subsidiary <a href="343%20Industries">343 Industries</a>. The game will be re-released for the <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> and <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> as part of "" at an unannounced date.

The game was notable for its inconsistencies with "", which had previously been the only depiction of the Fall of Reach.

"Halo: Reach" is a <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> in which players predominantly experience gameplay from a first-person perspective; the game perspective switches to third-person when using certain weapons and vehicles. Gameplay is more similar to "" than later games in the series. The player's <a href="head-up%20display">head-up display</a> displays and tracks a player's current weapons, abilities, and health; it also contains a compass and a "motion tracker" that registers moving allies, enemies, and vehicles in a certain radius of the player. The HUD changes when the player pilots aircraft and spacecraft.

In the game's campaign, which can be played alone or cooperatively, players assume the role of Noble Six, a <a href="supersoldier">supersoldier</a> engaged in combat with an alien collective known as the <a href="Covenant%20%28Halo%29">Covenant</a>. The Covenant come in eight distinct varieties with different ranks and classes for each type; for example, Elites are the leaders of a group, while Grunts are less intelligent and only dangerous in large groups. The player is equipped with a recharging energy shield that absorbs damage from weapons, fire and impacts. When the energy shield is depleted, the player loses health. When the player's health reaches zero, the character dies and the game reloads from a saved checkpoint. Health is replenished using <a href="health%20pack">health pack</a>s scattered throughout "Reach"s levels. The campaign's encounters with enemies are typically large, open spaces with weapons caches, cover from enemy fire and strategic vantage points. New to the "Halo" series are <a href="dogfight">dogfight</a> sequences set in space.

"Reach" features updated versions of old weapons, plus new weapons fulfilling various combat roles. In "Halo 3", players can carry single-use equipment <a href="power-up">power-up</a>s that offer temporary offensive or defensive advantages. This system of single-use equipment is replaced in "Reach" by reusable and persistent armor abilities that remain with a character until they are replaced. The abilities are a jetpack; <a href="active%20camouflage">active camouflage</a>; sprint; hologram, which creates a facsimile of the player running towards a target point; drop shield, which creates a bubble that heals those inside and protects them from a limited amount of damage; and armor lock, which immobilizes the player but grants invincibility for a brief period of time. When playing as Covenant Elites, players also have access to an evade armor ability.

"Reach" supports <a href="player-versus-player">player-versus-player</a> multiplayer through splitscreen on a single Xbox 360, local networks (<a href="System%20Link">System Link</a>), and the <a href="Xbox%20Live">Xbox Live</a> service. The game includes standard multiplayer modes such as "<a href="Deathmatch%20%28gaming%29">slayer</a>" and <a href="Capture%20the%20flag%23Software%20and%20games">capture the flag</a>, as well as gametypes new to the franchise. In "headhunter", players drop skulls upon death, which other players can pick up and deposit at special zones for points. When players die, all their accumulated skulls are dropped. "Stockpile" has teams race to collect neutral flags, holding them at capture points every minute for points. "Generator defense" pits three human supersoldiers, or Spartans, against three Covenant soldiers called Elites. The Elites' objective is to destroy three generators, while the Spartans defend the installation. After every round the players switch roles. "Invasion" is a six versus six mode with three squads of two on each team. The gametype matches Spartans against Elites; Elites vie for control of territories to disable a shield guarding a navigation core. Once the shield is disabled, they must transfer the core to a dropship; the Spartans must prevent this. As the game progresses, new vehicles and areas of the map become open.

Alongside other multiplayer options is "firefight", where players take on increasingly difficult waves of foes in a game of survival. Players can customize the firefight options, including the number and types of enemies. Firefight versus allows a player-controlled Elite team to try to stop a Spartan team from scoring points. Game modes like generator defense are also playable in firefight.

Also included with "Reach" is "Forge", a level editor. Players can edit the default multiplayer maps and a large empty map known as "Forge World", adding or modifying <a href="spawn%20point">spawn point</a>s, weapons and items. Objects may be phased into other objects, and can also be <a href="Snap%20%28computer%20graphics%29">snapped</a> to specific orientations. Other included features are the "theater", where players can watch saved films of their games and take screenshots and video clips for posterity, and the file share, where players can upload their screenshots, films, custom maps, and gametypes for public viewing.

"Reach" takes place in a futuristic <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> setting; the year is 2552, shortly before the events of the video game "Halo: Combat Evolved", and during the events of the novel "". Humans, under the auspices of the <a href="Factions%20of%20Halo%23United%20Nations%20Space%20Command">United Nations Space Command</a> (UNSC), have been waging a long war against a collective of alien races known as the Covenant. By the events of "Reach", almost all of humanity's interstellar colonies have fallen. Reach itself is an Earthlike colony that serves as the UNSC's main military hub. The colony is home to over 700 million civilians in addition to the military presence.

The game follows the actions of "Noble Team", a UNSC special operations unit composed of elite supersoldiers known as <a href="Characters%20of%20Halo%23Spartans">Spartans</a>. Players assume the role of a new addition to the team identified by the call sign Noble Six. Noble Team's leader is Carter-A259, a no-nonsense soldier. His second-in-command, Kat-B320, has a bionic arm; together, Carter and Kat are the only remaining original members of Noble Team. The other current members include heavy weapons specialist and surviving Spartan-II Jorge-052, assault specialist Emile-A239, and marksman Jun-A266.

The game opens with the planet Reach in ruins, then flashes back to before the devastating invasion by the Covenant. Noble Team, dispatched to investigate why a communications relay has gone offline, discovers Covenant forces on Reach. Soon after, the team defends "Sword Base", an Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) installation, from a Covenant vessel. The team meets <a href="Characters%20of%20Halo%23Catherine%20Halsey">Catherine Halsey</a>, a scientist and the mastermind behind the Spartan program and their MJOLNIR <a href="powered%20armor">powered armor</a>. Halsey informs Noble Team that the Covenant forces at the relay were searching for important information.

Jun and Six are dispatched on a covert mission to assess the Covenant's strength and discover an invasion force gathering on the planet. The following morning, Noble Team assists UNSC forces in assaulting a Covenant ground base. When a massive Covenant super-carrier joins the fight, Jorge and Six take part in a plan to destroy the super-carrier using a makeshift bomb. The Spartans use starfighters to infiltrate a smaller Covenant corvette, prepare the bomb and set the corvette on a docking course with the carrier, but the bomb's timer is damaged. Left with no choice, Jorge stays behind and sacrifices himself to destroy the super-carrier. Moments later, huge numbers of Covenant ships arrive at Reach and begin a full-scale invasion.

Six returns to the surface and travels to the city of New Alexandria. The Spartan aids the local military in fighting the Covenant and evacuating the city, reuniting with Noble Team along the way. They retreat to an underground bunker when the Covenant begin to bombard the city with plasma, but Kat is killed by a Covenant sniper before they reach it. Recalled to Sword Base, Noble Team is guided underground to an ancient artifact that Halsey believes is key to winning the war against the Covenant. Six, Carter and Emile are entrusted with transporting the artificial intelligence <a href="Cortana%20%28Halo%29">Cortana</a>, and the information she carries concerning the artifact, to the UNSC ship "Pillar of Autumn". Jun leaves the team to escort Halsey to another base.

En route to the "Autumn"s dry dock, Carter is critically wounded. He rams his ship into a Covenant mobile assault platform, allowing Six and Emile to safely reach the shipyard. Emile uses a <a href="coilgun">mass driver</a> emplacement to defend the "Autumn" while Six fights through Covenant ground forces to get Cortana to the "Autumn"s captain, <a href="Characters%20of%20Halo%23Jacob%20Keyes">Jacob Keyes</a>. When Emile is slain by Elites, Six remains behind to control the gun, ensuring the "Autumn"s escape. The "Autumn" flees from Reach and discovers a <a href="Halo%20%28megastructure%29">Halo</a> ringworld thanks to the data Halsey extracted from the artifact, leading directly to the events of "Halo: Combat Evolved".

The <a href="post-credits%20scene">post-credits scene</a> puts the player in control of Six's <a href="last%20stand">last stand</a> against overwhelming Covenant forces. After sustaining heavy damage, Six removes their shattered helmet and is eventually overwhelmed and killed. Some years later, Six's helmet remains on the grassy plains of a now-restored Reach with a ship landing in the background to bring new colonists to the planet. A narration by Halsey eulogizes Noble Team, who ultimately enabled humanity's victory over the Covenant.

"Halo: Reach" was announced on June 1, 2009, accompanied by a trailer at the Microsoft <a href="E3%202009">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) press conference. A press release announced that an invitation to the open multiplayer <a href="Software%20release%20life%20cycle%23Beta">beta</a> of the game would appear in 2010. "Reach" is Bungie's last game development for the "Halo" series. Responsibility for developing future "Halo" games fell to Microsoft subsidiary 343 Industries.

A trailer released March 3, 2010, showcased the game's multiplayer. Bungie revealed parts of the game's campaign and Firefight at E3 2010. The game reached the "zero bug release" milestone on June 23, signifying a shift from content creation to troubleshooting; buggy artificial intelligence or other elements would be removed rather than fixed at this point because of time constraints. Bungie released the complete list of achievements for the game on July 30, including their titles, symbols, and requirements, and completed "Reach" between the end of July and beginning of August 2010.

After "<a href="Halo%203">Halo 3</a>", development studio Bungie created an internal team to work on <a href="Peter%20Jackson">Peter Jackson</a>'s planned "Halo" game, "<a href="Halo%20%28series%29%23Cancelled%20and%20related%20projects">Halo Chronicles</a>". "Chronicles" was eventually canceled and the team began working on a standalone expansion project—"Halo 3: ODST"—while another team, led by creative director Marcus Lehto and design lead <a href="Christian%20Allen">Christian Allen</a>, worked on "Reach". The team considered many different concepts and approaches to the game; among the rejected ideas was a sequel to "Halo 3". The team eventually settled on a prequel to the first "Halo" game in brainstorming sessions. It would take place on the planet Reach, during a pivotal time in the war. "Reach, as a fictional planet, was just a great candidate [to] play around with. It's such a rich world, with such a great fiction surrounding it," said Lehto. "We were like: 'Okay, that's it. We've just got a lot of things we can do there so we can build an immense story with it.'" No longer burdened with continuing the story threads of the "Halo" trilogy, Bungie used "Reach" to introduce new characters and settings. As "Reach" ends with the destruction of the titular planet, Bungie wanted to be sure players still felt a sense of accomplishment and success. "It is a challenge overall to ensure the player feels they're doing the right thing all the way to the end," said Lehto.

Lehto recalled that making a character-driven story was a great challenge—players would come to know more about them as they progressed through the campaign, but the Spartan characters also had to behave intelligently. The "Halo" games consistently featured protagonists that were silent during gameplay sequences. Community manager Brian Jarrard pushed for allowing players to choose a female Noble Six and have the cinematics and dialogue change accordingly. The post-credit game sequence was the subject of intense discussion; some at Bungie wanted to remove it. Executive producer Joe Tung noted, "the 'survive' component ... felt great to us. We definitely talked about different versions of how that was happening and different versions of ending [the game] cinematically, but I think the way that it ultimately ended up is just a really well-paced, significant and emotionally impactful ending."

The developers originally intended to <a href="Porting">port</a> existing "Halo 3" assets to "Reach" and update them. For "Halo 3", Bungie had been forced to shrink parts of the game to fit the game engine's constraints, but wanted to make "Reach" look better than its predecessors. "The more we started looking into this, the more we found that realistically we could rebuild each asset from scratch with a huge increase in quality without significantly investing more time," said Bungie 3D artist Scott Shepherd. Texture resolution and polygon counts for models increased; the "Reach" assault rifle is constructed of more polygons than an entire Marine character from "Halo 3". The prequel concept also gave the art team an opportunity to redesign key enemies, weapons, and elements of the series. Artists found inspiration in the original concept art for "Halo: Combat Evolved"; the shape for the redesigned Covenant Grunts came from a sketch that <a href="concept%20art">concept art</a>ist Shi Kai Wang created ten years earlier.

The developers redesigned the <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a>, the software that handles rendering and much of gameplay. Bungie hired an expert in <a href="motion%20capture">motion capture</a> to develop more realistic character animations. Building a motion capture studio in-house saved Bungie time as motion capture data could be applied to the game models the same day it was shot. The developers sought to increase replay value by focusing on improving artificial intelligence. Rather than scripting enemy encounters, they focused on a more <a href="open%20world">open world</a> or sandbox approach to battles.

Composing team <a href="Martin%20O%27Donnell">Martin O'Donnell</a> and <a href="Michael%20Salvatori">Michael Salvatori</a> scored "Reach". O'Donnell wrote "somber, more visceral" music since the plot is character-driven and focuses on a planet that is already known—in the "Halo" <a href="fictional%20universe">fictional universe</a>—to have fallen. The first music he wrote for "Reach" was played for the game's world premiere, and he used it as a starting piece to develop further themes. O'Donnell began work on "Reach" while "ODST", for which he also wrote the music, was still in production, but did not begin composing until August 2009. Past "Halo" collaborators Salvatori, C. Paul Johnson, and Stan LePard assisted O'Donnell. With "Reach", he did not give them strictly divided responsibilities. "I decided this time to come up with some themes, tempos, keys, and other basic starting points for musical ideas," explained O'Donnell. "I shared these with all the other composers and just asked them to take off if they felt inspired by any of that material." The works-in-progress they came up with were either retouched by O'Donnell or sent back to be finished by their composer.

In previous "Halo" games, sections of music overlap and change depending on player action. "Reach"s system of interactive audio was much more complex, featuring the ability to combine up to seven layers of instrumentation compared to "Combat Evolved"s two. Developers also expanded the sound effect system. Every interacting object in "Reach" produces two sounds for respective objects; for example, a Warthog vehicle that hits an armored Covenant soldier produces a crunching metal noise based on the two colliding elements. The interaction between objects and terrain was demonstrated in an in-game environment that O'Donnell called "the stripey room" after the bands of alternating colors on the objects and environment.

"Reach"s multiplayer beta was open to owners of "Halo 3: ODST". More than three million copies of "ODST" were sold by November 2009. Bungie estimated between two and three million players for the upcoming "Reach" beta, compared to the 800,000 that participated in "Halo 3"s trial. Development schedules forced Bungie to release a six-week-old beta, fraught with bugs and issues already addressed in newer builds. Though concerned that these issues might tarnish the game's image, Jarrard noted that they had little choice but to ship it as it was and communicate with players concerning the fixes.

More than 2.7 million players participated in the beta, which lasted from May 3 to 20. The game was rolled out from an internal group of Bungie and Microsoft employees, with the total number of players in the thousands. When the beta went public, more than a million played the first day, causing back-end servers to struggle to handle the traffic. While the engineering team had overestimated server load, bugs in server clusters caused game uploads to become backed up, slowing matchmaking until the underlying issues could be fixed. Jarrard noted that the 16 million total hours of play time and large-scale rollout of the beta was vital to seeing how "Reach" would perform.

Bungie used the beta to fix mistakes, glitches, and balance issues within gameplay elements. "We needed our fans to provide feedback," said Lehto, adding that having a large audience to "hammer" on the game allowed them to gather useful feedback to mold the finished product. The game automatically collected statistics such as upload and matchmaking speeds, as well as game preferences; sorting out what Jarrard called "the more subjective anecdotal feedback" from emails, notes, and forums proved more difficult. The "Reach" beta generated over 360,000 forum posts on Bungie's community forums. Bungie created official threads for groups of issues to manage the high volume of feedback; "We tried to give people a little bit more of a direct avenue to give that feedback and to make our lives easier. It was definitely a lot to assess and digest," said Jarrard. Certain feedback from the players did not correlate with the statistical data obtained from the matches during the beta. Chris Carney, lead designer for the multiplayer mode, recalled vocal dissatisfaction with the pistol early in the beta; by the end of the beta, the weapon was responsible for most of the kills coming from newly included weapons in the game. Bungie deployed special test matches to eliminate <a href="lurking%20variable">lurking variable</a>s, balance gameplay, and make other informed changes.

"Reach" was released in three editions on September 14, 2010. The standard edition consisted of the game and its manual. The limited edition featured an artifact bag with story information, different packaging, and an exclusive set of in-game Elite armor. The "legendary edition" contained all the materials from the limited edition, a different packaging, two hours of developer commentary on the game's cutscenes, an in-game Spartan armor effect, and a statue created by <a href="McFarlane%20Toys">McFarlane Toys</a>. North American players who purchased a first run copy of the game (in-store near launch day or pre-ordered) received an in-game Spartan "recon" helmet customization; players in other regions could earn it only by pre-ordering. "Reach" also came bundled with a limited edition Xbox 360 Slim that sports "Halo"-themed sounds and finish and two controllers.

Bungie released a <a href="Game%20demo">demo</a> on May 24, 2010, featuring a single player level from the game's story mode, a multiplayer competitive map, and a cooperative firefight mission. Microsoft later listed "Reach" as an <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Marketplace">Xbox Live Marketplace</a> download on August 12, 2010, at a price of 99999 <a href="Microsoft%20Points">Microsoft Points</a> (~US$1250). A spokesperson confirmed the download was for media review purposes, and that there were no plans to distribute the game to the public through Games on Demand. Four days later, hackers managed to access, download, and distribute the game online; Microsoft stated they were investigating the matter. "Halo 2", "Halo 3", and "ODST" were similarly leaked ahead of their planned release.

According to Jarrard, the team decided to have much more "grandiose" marketing for "Reach" than that of "ODST". Microsoft gave "Reach" its largest game marketing budget at the time, surpassing the scale and $6.5 million cost of <a href="Halo%203%20marketing">"Halo 3"s award-winning marketing</a>. Marketers focused their efforts on connecting with consumers via universal themes, rather than outdoing "Halo 3"s push. <a href="Interpublic%20Group%20of%20Companies">Interpublic Group of Companies</a>' AgencyTwoFifteen handled strategy and video development for the marketing push, while <a href="AKQA">AKQA</a> developed interactive components. The agencies were involved with "Halo 3"s marketing. The advertisers' brief was simple: "Remember Reach. Focus on the heroes, not the victims. Expand our audience beyond "Halo" <a href="fanboy">fanboy</a>s."

The advertising campaign commenced in April 2010 with the live-action short "Birth of a Spartan". A series of online videos highlighting a day in the life of average Reach citizens before the Covenant invade, began on August 23, followed by TV spots on August 29. The series concluded in late August with another short, "Deliver Hope". As part of the promotions, Microsoft created an interactive <a href="Light%20art">light sculpture</a>; users logged onto a website where they could direct a <a href="KUKA">KUKA industrial robot</a> to plot pinpricks of light; over 54,000 points created a monument to Noble Team that faded unless more points were plotted. "Reach"s marketing won several industry distinctions, among them thirteen medals from the MI6 Game Marketing Conference Awards.

Several lines of tie-in merchandise were launched. McFarlane, who had produced toys for "Halo 3", created a line of five-inch action figures, while Square Enix's Play Arts toy label created additional figures.

"Reach" was released Tuesday, September 14 in 25 countries. Tens of thousands of stores signed up for midnight launch events; sponsored events took place in London, Oslo, Stockholm, and New York.

"Reach" made $200 million in first-day sales, a record for the franchise. Its strong sales suggested to analysts that core titles in the holiday season could reverse sluggish video game sales in 2010. In its first sixteen days the game sold $350 million worth of merchandise. "Reach" premiered at the top of Xbox 360 and multi-platform charts in most territories. Figures from the <a href="NPD%20Group">NPD Group</a> estimated that "Reach" sold 3.3 million units in North America, making it the third game for its console generation (Xbox 360, PS3, Wii) to sell more than three million units during the first month of its release (alongside "Halo 3" and "<a href="Modern%20Warfare%202">Modern Warfare 2</a>"). "Halo: Reach" became the third bestselling game of 2010 in North America, behind "" and "<a href="Madden%20NFL%2011">Madden NFL 11</a>". It sold 4.7 million units by September 2011.

In the United Kingdom, "Reach"s opening week was the fifth-best launch in the territory, beating "Halo 3"s debut by 20,000 units and "ODST"s by 200,000 units. In its second week on the UK charts "Reach" was the second bestselling title, displaced by the racing game "<a href="F1%202010%20%28video%20game%29">F1 2010</a>". "Reach" continued to hold the top place in North America. In Japan, the game debuted at first place with 44,413 units, but fared poorly in the long-term (as have other "Halo" games). This showing was above "ODST"s sales of 29,734 in the comparable timeframe, but below "Halo 3"s 61,143. "Reach" dropped out of the top 20 best selling titles entirely its second week.

"Reach" supports additional <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> (DLC). Bungie released the game's first DLC, dubbed the "Noble Map Pack", on November 30, 2010; this map pack contains three maps, unique in that they are not based on "Reach" campaign levels. Microsoft partnered with <a href="Certain%20Affinity">Certain Affinity</a>, which had worked on "Halo 2" maps, to produce the second, "Defiant Map Pack", made available for download on March 15, 2011.

A "title update" was released by 343 Industries for "Reach" that modified game mechanics such as bullet spread and melee damage. The update also contained playlists for "". Purchasers of anniversary edition received a voucher to download the game's seven multiplayer maps directly into "Reach", the map pack was also made available to purchase via the Xbox Live Marketplace.

"Halo: Reach" received critical acclaim upon its release. On aggregating review website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, it holds an average of 91/100, respectively. Critics such as <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>'s Thierry Nguyen, the staff of "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>", "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>"s Matt Cabral, and others considered "Reach" the best "Halo" title yet. Reviewers noted there were few major changes to the "Halo" formula; <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Erik Brudvig wrote that "Reach" was not "another rehash", though franchise veterans would feel immediately at home with the game.

Nguyen, Tom Hoggins of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>", and others wrote that "Reach" took the best elements from previous games and combined them in Bungie's final entry. Hoggins noted that this approach made "Reach" "a blistering, breathless crescendo to a decade's worth of work", but also that it was unlikely to convert non-"Halo" fans. The "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>"s Kevin Lynch praised Bungie for introducing new gameplay mechanics like jetpacks without ruining the title's learning curve or game balance.

Brudvig praised the campaign for avoiding the "repetitive landscapes and circuitous, difficult to follow plots" of past "Halo" titles. <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Chris Watters and others felt the artificial intelligence of friendly non-player characters was less advanced than that of enemies, especially while driving. Steve Boxer wrote for "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" that "Reach"s story made previous entries feel "amateurish"; Nguyen felt that whereas previous "Halo" titles had become mired in inconsistencies and "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>"-like <a href="technobabble">technobabble</a>, "Reach" told a broader and more accessible story. Despite this, he contended, the game suffered from archetypal characters with which players spent little time: "I almost forgot that Noble Four (Emile) even existed for a big chunk of the campaign, as I rarely saw him." "<a href="Wired%20%28website%29">Wired</a>"s Gus Mastrapa unfavorably compared Noble Team to the marines of "<a href="Aliens%20%28film%29">Aliens</a>", writing that most of the characters were unmemorable and one-dimensional. Nguyen also faulted the game for occasional lapses in exposition, but summed these up as "minor quibbles" compared to the improvements. In contrast, <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a>'s Charlie Baratt opined that "Reach"s campaign was better than "ODST"s, but lacked the "franchise-changing potential" it promised. Lynch judged that while Bungie still had not learned to create a perfect story, "["Reach"] does expertly set up bombastic scene after scene".

Ben Kuchera of "<a href="Ars%20Technica">Ars Technica</a>" enjoyed the multiplayer component of "Reach" for its scope—"no matter how you play, you will find something to like." Reviewers lauded the many customization options available to players: Watters and Kuchera praised the concept of psych profiles to hone more agreeable teammate selections, but questioned its effectiveness; <a href="G4%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">G4</a> considered "Reach"s Forge World more expansive and impressive than "Halo 3"s Forge offerings; and Lynch wrote that the sheer quantity of multiplayer options would give the game a long life cycle for players.

Critics considered the audio-visual components a marked advance over "Halo 3" and "ODST"s. "<a href="The%20New%20Zealand%20Herald">The New Zealand Herald</a>"s Troy Rawhiti-Forbes wrote that with the improved graphics and animation, "["Reach"] looks just like a big-budget Hollywood project." "<a href="Official%20Xbox%20Magazine">Official Xbox Magazine</a>" acknowledged better graphics in other games, but praised "Reach" for "eye-catching beauty and breathless scope", noting that the inclusion of wildlife and civilians heightened the impression of a planet under siege. Martin Robinson of IGN UK appreciated O'Donnell's moody score and the redone sound effects, writing that the new weapons "feel like they're about to tear your hands off".

Tales of Monkey Island

Tales of Monkey Island is a 2009 <a href="graphic%20adventure%20game">graphic adventure</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by <a href="Telltale%20Games">Telltale Games</a> under license from <a href="LucasArts">LucasArts</a>. It is the fifth game in the "<a href="Monkey%20Island%20%28series%29">Monkey Island</a>" series, released nearly a decade after the previous installment, "<a href="Escape%20from%20Monkey%20Island">Escape from Monkey Island</a>". Developed for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> and the <a href="Wii">Wii</a> console, the game was released in five <a href="episodic%20video%20game">episodic</a> segments, between July and December 2009. In contrast to Telltale's previous episodic adventure games, whose chapters told discrete stories, each chapter of "Tales of Monkey Island" is part of an ongoing narrative. The game was <a href="Digital%20distribution">digitally distributed</a> through <a href="WiiWare">WiiWare</a> and Telltale's own website, and later through <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> and <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>. Ports for <a href="OS%20X">OS X</a>, the <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a>, and <a href="iOS">iOS</a> were released several months after the series ended.

Players assume the role of <a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Piracy">pirate</a> <a href="Guybrush%20Threepwood">Guybrush Threepwood</a>, who—while attempting to destroy his nemesis, the undead pirate <a href="LeChuck">LeChuck</a>—accidentally releases a <a href="hoodoo%20%28folk%20magic%29">voodoo</a> pox across the Gulf of Melange. With the assistance of his wife, <a href="Elaine%20Marley">Elaine</a>, Guybrush seeks out a cure. The game was conceived in late 2008, due to renewed interest in adventure game development within LucasArts. It was developed concurrently with LucasArts' <a href="Video%20game%20remake">special edition</a> of the 1990 title "<a href="The%20Secret%20of%20Monkey%20Island">The Secret of Monkey Island</a>"; LucasArts oversaw production of "Tales of Monkey Island", and ensured that it matched the remake in certain areas, such as art direction. Production began in early 2009; franchise creator <a href="Ron%20Gilbert">Ron Gilbert</a> was involved in project planning, while development was led by <a href="Dave%20Grossman%20%28game%20developer%29">Dave Grossman</a>, who co-designed the first two "Monkey Island" games. The game's music was composed by <a href="Michael%20Land">Michael Land</a>, and the core cast of "<a href="The%20Curse%20of%20Monkey%20Island">The Curse of Monkey Island</a>" reprised their voice roles.

"Tales of Monkey Island" received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the game's story, writing, humor, voice acting and characterization; <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> described Guybrush as Telltale's strongest and most expressive character yet. The game's music and graphics were also lauded. Complaints focused primarily on the perceived erratic quality of the game's puzzle design, a weak supporting cast in the early chapters, and the game's control system. "Tales of Monkey Island" garnered several industry awards, and was Telltale's most commercially successful project until "".

Like its predecessors, "Tales of Monkey Island" is a <a href="graphic%20adventure%20game">graphic adventure game</a>; the player assumes the role of the protagonist in an <a href="Interactive%20storytelling">interactive story</a>, which is driven by the exploration of the game's <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional</a> (3D) environments and by solving puzzles. These puzzles are traditional adventure game conundrums that require the player to use the environment, or items that have been found and stored inside the game's inventory, to accomplish goals. In keeping with previous "<a href="Monkey%20Island%20%28series%29">Monkey Island</a>" games, "Tales of Monkey Island" allows players to combine certain items to create new items; for instance, the player can combine a number of voodoo ingredients with a cutlass to produce a magical cutlass.

The game world is explored with a <a href="Personal%20computer">PC</a> keyboard and mouse, or the <a href="Wii%20Nunchuk">Wii Nunchuk</a>'s <a href="analog%20stick">analog stick</a>. Contrary to previous Telltale adventure games, the player holds and drags the mouse to move Guybrush, rather than <a href="point%20and%20click">point and click</a>ing. The <a href="WASD%20keys">WASD keys</a> or the arrow keys may instead be used to move Guybrush. Like other "Monkey Island" games, "Tales of Monkey Island" is designed to prevent the player from meeting a dead-end, such as the death of the player character. Each of the game's chapters is an estimated two to four hours in length, depending on the player's ability to solve the puzzles. A hint system can assist struggling players.

The first chapter of the game includes a "treasure hunt" mode, where the player directs Guybrush through a maze-like jungle in pursuit of hidden treasure. Found treasures translate into prizes and discounts on Telltale's website. To access this mode, the player must locate maps on the Internet, hidden on the official Telltale website and three participating "Monkey Island" fansites.

"Tales of Monkey Island" is set several years after the events of "<a href="Escape%20from%20Monkey%20Island">Escape from Monkey Island</a>". The designers discarded the Tri-Island Area—the setting of the game's predecessors—in favor of a new locale: the Gulf of Melange. The game follows <a href="Guybrush%20Threepwood">Guybrush Threepwood</a> (voiced by <a href="Dominic%20Armato">Dominic Armato</a>), a pirate who is naïve and hapless, yet successful. Before the game's beginning, Guybrush spends years locating the elements needed to create the Cursed Cutlass of Kaflu, a <a href="Hoodoo%20%28folk%20magic%29">voodoo</a> weapon capable of destroying his nemesis, the demon pirate <a href="LeChuck">LeChuck</a> (voiced by <a href="Adam%20Harrington%20%28voice%20actor%29">Adam Harrington</a>, Kevin Blackton and later <a href="Earl%20Boen">Earl Boen</a>). As with other "Monkey Island" games, LeChuck vies for the love of <a href="Elaine%20Marley">Elaine Marley-Threepwood</a> (voiced by <a href="Alexandra%20Boyd">Alexandra Boyd</a>), the wife of Guybrush Threepwood and former governor of the Tri-Island Area. In the events immediately before the game, LeChuck kidnaps Elaine. Guybrush pursues LeChuck with the voodoo cutlass.

Several ancillary characters from earlier games in the series return in "Tales of Monkey Island", including the <a href="Monkey%20Island%20%28series%29">Voodoo Lady</a> (voiced by Alison Ewing), an enigmatic <a href="Haitian%20Vodou">voodoo priestess</a> who advises Guybrush in his quests; Stan (voiced by <a href="Gavin%20Hammon">Gavin Hammon</a>), a stereotypical salesman and business opportunist; and <a href="Monkey%20Island%20%28series%29">Murray</a> (voiced by <a href="Denny%20Delk">Denny Delk</a>), a talking skull with delusions of grandeur. The game introduces new characters to the series, such as Morgan LeFlay (voiced by <a href="Nicki%20Rapp">Nicki Rapp</a>), a competent and athletic female <a href="bounty%20hunter">bounty hunter</a> who idolizes Guybrush. Other additions to the cast include Coronado DeCava, an explorer and former lover of the Voodoo Lady (voiced by <a href="Kid%20Beyond">Andrew Chaikin</a>), and the Marquis de Singe (voiced by <a href="Jared%20Emerson-Johnson">Jared Emerson-Johnson</a>), an antagonistic French nobleman and doctor.

Having acquired the components of the Cutlass of Kaflu, Guybrush races to the Rock of Gelato to save his wife from LeChuck; however, he fails to properly create the sword. When Guybrush stabs LeChuck, the flawed cutlass transforms LeChuck into a human, and infects Guybrush's hand with the "Pox of LeChuck", which gives the hand a mind of its own. An explosion on the ship hurls Guybrush into the ocean, and he later washes up on Flotsam Island. There, Guybrush encounters the Voodoo Lady, who explains that the pox will ravage the Caribbean, unless it is absorbed by a voodoo <a href="sponge">sea sponge</a> called ""La Esponja Grande"" (The Big Sponge). Guybrush is advised to seek Coronado DeCava, a <a href="conquistador">conquistador</a> who is on an expedition to find "La Esponja Grande"; however, to leave the island, Guybrush must neutralize a machine that is drawing the winds inward, and thereby preventing ships from leaving. It is revealed that the Marquis de Singe is using the machine to bring pirates to the island for his medical experiments. De Singe becomes obsessed with Guybrush's hand, as he believes it to be key to eternal life. Guybrush reverts the wind patterns to normal— unwittingly causing the pox to spread across the sea —and departs in his newly acquired ship, the "Screaming Narwhal". De Singe hires a pirate hunter by the name of Morgan LeFlay to capture Guybrush; en route to the Jerkbait Islands, she boards the "Screaming Narwhal" and cuts off Guybrush's pox-infected hand in a duel. Afterwards, she returns it to de Singe.

On the Jerkbait Islands, Guybrush finds Elaine safe, and learns that the now-human LeChuck is trying to make up for the evil deeds of his past. The three help to defend the resident <a href="mermaid">merfolk</a> city from pox-infected pirates; in return, the merfolk summon sea creatures to assist Guybrush in locating "La Esponja Grande". Elaine stays behind to monitor LeChuck's actions. As Guybrush follows the creatures on the "Screaming Narwhal", Morgan again boards the ship; de Singe had informed her that Guybrush's "entire body" was needed. Distracted by their duel, neither can react in time when the "Screaming Narwhal" is swallowed whole by a giant <a href="manatee">manatee</a>. Inside the manatee, Guybrush and LeFlay discover the crazed DeCava and his crew; Guybrush heals the manatee's injuries, and escapes with DeCava to the location of "La Esponja Grande" (which turns out to be much smaller than advertised). After retrieving "La Esponja Grande", Morgan knocks Guybrush unconscious and sets sail for Flotsam Island with her bounty.

As Morgan reluctantly delivers Guybrush to de Singe, Guybrush is seized by the townspeople and put on trial for multiple crimes- chief among them having released the pox across the Gulf of Melange. LeChuck exonerates Guybrush by implicating himself in the creation of the pox, and produces evidence that all previous confrontations between Guybrush and LeChuck had been orchestrated by the Voodoo Lady; the two are imprisoned, and Guybrush is released. As Guybrush prepares to cure the pox with "La Esponja Grande", he finds Morgan murdered in de Singe's laboratory. At the wind machine, de Singe traps Guybrush and Elaine, and believes that his experiments with Guybrush's hand are on the verge of granting him immortality. However, de Singe falls into the wind machine and is disintegrated; Guybrush then uses "La Esponja Grande" to absorb the pox. LeChuck arrives to free the two, but as Guybrush thanks him, LeChuck impales him on the Cutlass of Kaflu, and uses "La Esponja Grande" to transfer the pox's potency to himself.

Now deceased, Guybrush finds his spiritual self at the <a href="Crossroads%20%28mythology%29">Crossroads</a>: the place where the living and dead realms meet. With the assistance of Morgan's spirit, he finds a spell that embodies courage, anchor, direction and sacrifice, and returns to the land of the living as a ghost. However, LeChuck absorbs the massive amount of energy generated by a dimensional rift Guybrush opens; the pox was engineered by LeChuck to achieve this goal. Elaine, in an apparent act of betrayal, becomes LeChuck's demon bride. Guybrush repossesses his dead body and shrinks "La Esponja Grande", reversing LeChuck's hold over Elaine. LeChuck attacks Guybrush, who lures the demon pirate into the rift. There, LeChuck is simultaneously stabbed by Elaine and Morgan, which destroys his physical and spiritual forms. Stranded alone at the crossroads, Guybrush realizes that he has one more item that meets the spell's criteria for his return: Elaine's wedding ring. He uses it to restore himself to life and return to his wife. The spirit of Morgan delivers a jar containing the essence of LeChuck to the Voodoo Lady, in exchange for her return to the land of the living.

Developed by <a href="Telltale%20Games">Telltale Games</a>, under license from <a href="LucasArts">LucasArts</a>, "Tales of Monkey Island" marked a first collaboration between the two companies. Telltale Games had been founded by former LucasArts employees in the wake of the 2004 cancellation of "". Following that event, LucasArts appeared to have abandoned the adventure game genre. While Telltale Games had considered developing a "Monkey Island" game since their inception, the company's design director, <a href="Dave%20Grossman%20%28game%20developer%29">Dave Grossman</a>, credited the greenlighting of "Tales of Monkey Island" to the correct alignment of interested parties. This included the then-new president of LucasArts, Darrell Rodriguez, who helped push for adventure game development within his company. Mark Darin, co-designer and writer for "Tales of Monkey Island", attributed the revival of interest to the rise of <a href="digital%20distribution">digital distribution</a> within the video game industry, which—by reducing financial risk—allowed companies such as Telltale to develop "something different from the endless clones of popular games". Telltale started designing "Tales of Monkey Island" in late 2008; production commenced early in 2009.

Following hints by Telltale Games that they would soon announce a major new series, "Tales of Monkey Island" was unveiled at the June 2009 <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a>. Its roughly 50 person development team was headed by Dave Grossman, who co-designed the first two "Monkey Island" games. "Escape from Monkey Island" and "<a href="Sam%20%26amp%3B%20Max%20Hit%20the%20Road">Sam & Max Hit the Road</a>" co-designer Michael Stemmle contributed design and story writing, in collaboration with Mark Darin and Sean Vanaman. Series creator <a href="Ron%20Gilbert">Ron Gilbert</a> was involved in brainstorm sessions for the game, but did not have a large role in its development; however, the development team asserted that Gilbert's "thumbprints are all over [the game]". "Tales of Monkey Island" counterparts a LucasArts-developed <a href="Video%20game%20remake">enhanced remake</a> of "<a href="The%20Secret%20of%20Monkey%20Island">The Secret of Monkey Island</a>". On his blog, Gilbert wrote that he was "very excited" for both Telltale's adaptation and LucasArts' reimagining of the original game, and stated that "it's strange and humbling to see something you created 20 years ago take on a life of its own".

While Gilbert and Grossman were engaged in the development of "Tales of Monkey Island", the third co-designer of the original two games, <a href="Tim%20Schafer">Tim Schafer</a>, was not associated with the project. Grossman said that Gilbert's leadership role at <a href="Hothead%20Games">Hothead Games</a> had made procuring his assistance "legal wrangling", and that including Schafer as well would have been too much trouble. Schafer later said that he was "really happy" for the new game, and that the project was in good hands under Grossman's lead. The game's limited-edition slipcover artwork was painted by "Sam & Max" creator <a href="Steve%20Purcell">Steve Purcell</a>, who was responsible for the box art of both "The Secret of Monkey Island" and "". Purcell created three different rough covers to present to Telltale Games, though the company valued Purcell's own opinion on which was best. Having not been satisfied with Elaine's appearance on the cover of "The Secret of Monkey Island", Purcell was keen to have another attempt to portray the character in his artwork. The final artwork, showing Guybrush and Elaine brandishing cutlasses on a ship emerging from fog, was favored as Purcell felt it was appropriately eerie.

Grossman said that the game's simultaneous release on Windows and WiiWare was due to Telltale's business model; the company alternates its game releases between WiiWare and <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Arcade">Xbox Live Arcade</a>, as they want to "give the Wii a little love as well". The concurrent development of the Wii version created issues; last minute changes to the PC version could put an episode over the size limit for WiiWare games. The first episode was released for Windows on July 7, 2009, with the Wii version following twenty days later. Telltale distributed the game through their own website, and later made it available for download from <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> and <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>. Xbox Live was omitted from the initial release, as both Telltale's "<a href="Wallace%20%26amp%3B%20Gromit%27s%20Grand%20Adventures">Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures</a>", and LucasArts' special edition of "The Secret of Monkey Island", were debuting on the system.

While Telltale had not announced plans to port "Tales of Monkey Island" to Mac OS, they did so on February 11, 2010; it was among the first games available for the newly released Mac OS <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> client. A <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a> version was released in June 2010, due to consumer demand generated by the game's original announcement. A PlayStation 3 release had not been possible at launch, as Telltale's game engine was not built to run on the platform. An <a href="iPad">iPad</a>-enhanced <a href="iOS">iOS</a> port was being developed in 2010; the first episode was released on the <a href="App%20Store%20%28iOS%29">App Store</a> in December 2010, and the rest of the episodes followed on June 23, 2011. As a bonus, players were offered the chance to download the first episode for free until July 22, 2011. Telltale Games has not ruled out the option of porting the game to Xbox Live and <a href="Linux">Linux</a>. However, a port for the <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a>-enhanced iOS version was developed, and the first episode was released in November 2011, with the four remaining episodes that followed suit in a few months, ending with the release of Chapter 5 on February 23, 2012.

As with Telltale's other products, "Tales of Monkey Island" was developed and released in five <a href="episodic%20video%20game">episodic</a> segments; Grossman explained that Telltale prefers to tell stories this way, rather than as continuous narratives that are too long for people to play comfortably. However, unlike their previous games, each episode is not a standalone tale; it is a single chapter in a larger plot. This allowed Telltale to advance the story like that of a television series, in which character relationships develop in the minds of the audience over several months. Each episode is designed to be gratifying on its own, with a satisfying conclusion; however, it then provides a cliffhanger to "tantalize the player a little more". According to Grossman, "Tales of Monkey Island" is set after an "imaginary" "Monkey Island 5", which he views as "a blockbuster, epic 40-hour gigantic experience like the earlier games". Its story would have followed Guybrush's actions in the time between "Escape from Monkey Island" and "Tales of Monkey Island"; the beginning of "Tales of Monkey Island" would have marked its conclusion. Grossman maintained that both the story and gameplay of "Tales of Monkey Island" were designed to be accessible for newcomers to the series, and commented that "knowledge of the characters and their history will add a nostalgic layer to the sly references, but is by no means necessary".

Stemmle likened the game's episodic development to a relay race, and the development of a full game, such as "Escape from Monkey Island", to a "marathon". This production method meant that certain aspects, such as the game's graphics, were worked on until the release deadline. Each episode took around four months to complete. Only a few environmental resources were reused between episodes; while Telltale Games had built previous games such as "<a href="Sam%20%26amp%3B%20Max%20Save%20the%20World">Sam & Max Save the World</a>" and "Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures" around one set of locations, using the protagonists' homes and nearby streets consistently in each episode, the developers forwent such central hubs and "comfort zones" in "Tales of Monkey Island", instead having each episode move off to a new primary location, only occasionally revisiting past locations. However, reusable <a href="skeletal%20animation">skeletons and animations</a> were developed for the supporting cast, including generic body types that could be visually altered to suit each character. While four of these were created, size constraints resulted in only two being included in the final game. By the game's third episode, Telltale became unsatisfied with this system, and began diversifying facial features, and providing supporting characters with unique silhouettes and animations.

The game's artistic direction was developed by former LucasArts members Derek Sakai and Dave Bogan; both of them had worked on "<a href="The%20Curse%20of%20Monkey%20Island">The Curse of Monkey Island</a>", "Escape from Monkey Island", and several earlier <a href="LucasArts%20adventure%20games">LucasArts adventure games</a>. The game's final art direction was an attempt to combine the realistic look of the first two "Monkey Island" games with the whimsical, stylized graphics of the third. While those games feature entirely <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">two-dimensional graphics</a>, and their successor, "Escape from Monkey Island", is largely <a href="Pre-rendering">pre-rendered</a>, "Tales of Monkey Island" is rendered in full <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a>. Grossman explained that both Telltale's art department and <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> are oriented toward 3D graphics development, and that the company enjoys the benefits 3D offers in the areas of animation and cinematography. Improved capacity for the latter resulted in the appointment of a "cinematic director": someone to help the designers locate scenes needing more dramatic activity, and to assist the animators and choreographers in creating it. During development, the necessity of this position was highlighted by a ship battle scene in "Launch of the "Screaming Narwhal"", which was initially static and unexciting. This was remedied by changing the time of day from dusk to night, adding rain and other weather effects, and using camera movement to simulate rough waters.

Regarding the puzzle design in "Tales of Monkey Island", Stemmle said that he and his fellow designers—when they were younger—believed that they needed to "stump the player"; however, Stemmle now considers it "a "lot" better to make the players feel smart". Therefore, the designers included a hint system to prevent players from becoming stuck. Grossman explained that Telltale's designers would bear in mind how players would mentally progress through the puzzles, and consider "what realisations we expected them to have and whether those expectations are realistic". Due to a tight development schedule, puzzles in the first episode were not optimized for the game's control system, which was re-designed late in development. Initially, the game was to feature <a href="Point%20and%20click">point-and-click</a> controls, as had been used in the majority of Telltale's previous games. However, a "direct control" method—similar to the one seen in "Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures"—was decided upon after much of the first episode had been planned. As the direct control in that game had been designed for an Xbox controller, the developers reworked the idea into a "click-and-drag" mouse system for "Tales of Monkey Island". Telltale believed that this control method made for a less passive and more engaging player experience, and provided more freedom for cinematic camera work than was possible with point-and-click.

Aside from providing the "Monkey Island" license to Telltale, LucasArts' role in the game's development involved collaboration and approval of the game's script, character concept art and puzzle design. As the remake of "The Secret of Monkey Island" had begun development before "Tales of Monkey Island", LucasArts shared their art style guide with Telltale, so that the two products' art direction would be similar. In particular, LucasArts wished that the character of Guybrush would be comparable to the appearance of the character in the special edition. LucasArts largely based their vision for Guybrush's new visuals in "Tales of Monkey Island" on how the character appeared in "The Curse of Monkey Island", integrating various aspects from "LeChuck's Revenge" that commonly resonated through fan art, such as the character's blue coat and beard, in addition to using their own stylized art direction. Telltale concept artist Ryan Jones worked closely with LucasArts' Jeff Sengalli on developing the appearance of Guybrush and other characters, Sengalli providing feedback and refinement in such areas as character silhouettes, facial features and clothing. Vanaman noted that LucasArts was open to Telltale's creative direction for the game, and did not "put their foot down" over any aspects of their vision.

<a href="Michael%20Land">Michael Land</a>, the composer behind preceding "Monkey Island" games, returned to score "Tales of Monkey Island". In-house Telltale composer <a href="Jared%20Emerson-Johnson">Jared Emerson-Johnson</a> said that his own role in the game's music was "technical and administrative", and that, while he had been willing to assist Land, "the sound of the "Monkey Island" universe is all about Mike’s vision, so he was left alone to 'do his thing' as only he can". The soundtrack was recorded in <a href="MIDI">MIDI</a> format to reduce the data size for the Wii version; for the Windows version, the files were converted to <a href="WAV">WAV</a> for increased quality. In each episode's production, music was among the last elements to be finalized, as it could not be finished until all <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s were properly timed.

<a href="Dominic%20Armato">Dominic Armato</a>, the voice actor of Guybrush from "The Curse of Monkey Island" onward, reprises his role as that character. LucasArts encouraged Telltale to retain as much of the original cast as possible—particularly Armato, who was described by LucasArts' David Collins as "the ultimate "Monkey Island" fanboy". Armato enjoyed his opportunity to voice Guybrush again; he had believed that the series would never be continued, due to the length of time since "Escape from Monkey Island"s release. Armato voiced the character in both "Tales of Monkey Island" and the special edition of "The Secret of Monkey Island"; in the former game, he attempted to make Guybrush sound more mature and experienced than his younger incarnation in the latter. Because of Armato's understanding of the character, the voice directors gave him considerable flexibility in his performance.

Elaine Marley's voice actress in "The Curse of Monkey Island", <a href="Alexandra%20Boyd">Alexandra Boyd</a>, was also brought back for her role. Boyd was unable to travel to Telltale's studio in California; instead, she recorded her lines in London, while communicating with the voice director via <a href="Skype">Skype</a>. However, <a href="Earl%20Boen">Earl Boen</a>—the original voice actor for LeChuck—had retired from acting, and was not initially available to reprise his role. The character was instead voiced by Adam Harrington in the first episode, and replaced by Kevin Blackton as the human LeChuck in chapters two to four. Boen returned to voice the demon LeChuck at the end of the fourth episode, and stayed on for the game's fifth and final chapter. Telltale later had Boen re-record the lines for LeChuck's demon incarnation in the first episode for the DVD release. To make the actors' portrayals more forceful, Telltale implemented a <a href="lip%20sync">lip sync</a> system capable of presenting a large range of facial expressions on character models.

To promote "Tales of Monkey Island", Telltale Games posted a series of fan-made <a href="Flash%20animation">Flash short films</a> on their website. Entitled "I Wonder What Happens in Tales of Monkey Island", the series was created by German animator Marius Fietzek, who co-wrote it with Andrei Constantinescu. The series' artwork was produced by Martin Koehler. Presented as a cartoon version of "Tales of Monkey Island", the shorts speculated on the game's story and content, and depicted hypothetical events for the upcoming chapters. The first episode debuted on July 5, 2009, two days before the release of "Launch of the "Screaming Narwhal"". The second and third episodes followed on August 6 and September 16, respectively; the penultimate episode was released on October 22. For the final installment, released on December 4, Fietzek recruited <a href="Smudo">Smudo</a> of the German hip hop band <a href="Die%20Fantastischen%20Vier">Die Fantastischen Vier</a> to do a musical number. Emerson-Johnson described the series as "absolutely fantastic", and said that "it really seems like these games appeal to people in a way that spurs huge amounts of excellent creative energy". He noted that Telltale "was passing [the videos] around for a good week" after they were posted.

A week after the release of the first episode, Telltale held a contest called "Game Designer for a Day", which gave fans the opportunity to submit and vote for a line of dialog to be used as an accusation against Guybrush. The winning line, "He dug up my perfectly good X!", was submitted by Liz Johnston of <a href="Okanagan">Okanagan</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, and was subsequently added to the trial scene in the fourth chapter while Johnston's name was included in the chapter's credits.

Telltale produced "Tales of Monkey Island" merchandise, which they sold from their online store. These included a poster print of Steve Purcell's cover artwork for the game, and a set of promotional badges; the latter had previously been available at conventions, such as E3. Further merchandise—including a tankard, a set of tarot cards, and a deluxe edition DVD—was made available in early March 2010. For the September 19, 2009 <a href="International%20Talk%20Like%20a%20Pirate%20Day">International Talk Like a Pirate Day</a>, Telltale Games made the game's first episode available for free on their website. Customers who had already purchased all five episodes were instead eligible for a free episode from one of Telltale's other series.

"Tales of Monkey Island" was a commercial success, and it exceeded Telltale's sales projections. While no figures for the game have been released, the game was the company's most successful project, until it was outstripped by "", which was released a year and a half later. Telltale CEO Dan Conners noted that the game had been the top selling product on Steam for "a few days". According to Telltale's marketing department, the game was predominately purchased as a full season, rather than as individual episodes. This was attributed to the strong narrative between episodes, in contrast to Telltale's previous work.

Critics believed that the first chapter, "Launch of the "Screaming Narwhal"", was a respectable start to the game. Ryan Scott of <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> wrote that the puzzles "generally challenge [the player] "just" enough without becoming too frustrating", while <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer's</a> Kristan Reed stated that their quality was "bang-on time after time". However, criticism was directed toward certain puzzles' designs—particularly toward that of one maze puzzle. The writing and story were lauded, with several reviews commending the dialogue's humor. <a href="Adventure%20Gamers">Adventure Gamers</a> staff writer Evan Dickens felt that writing did not match up to the quality of "LeChuck's Revenge", however. Although the chapter's supporting cast was considered weak, critics enjoyed the introduction of de Singe to the series. The voicework for the main characters was praised, as was Land's soundtrack. Critics were mostly complimentary toward the episode's graphics, with "<a href="New%20Straits%20Times">New Straits Times</a>" Bruno Chan and "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" David Phelan praising the updated interpretation of "The Curse of Monkey Island"s art style while <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com's</a> Bob Mackey called Guybrush "the most convincingly expressive Telltale character yet"; however, concerns were voiced over erratic graphical quality between characters. The game's controls were subject to reproof by a number of reviews; several preferred the keyboard controls over Telltale's new "click and drag" system.

Response to "The Siege of Spinner Cay" was similar to that of the preceding episode. Critics were divided over the quality of the chapter's puzzles: <a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a> reviewer Brad Nicholson criticized their design as "tight and constricted", and Dickens felt that they varied wildly in quality. In contrast, they were praised as "pleasantly non-linear" by Reed, and called logical and sensible by <a href="PALGN">PALGN's</a> Adam Ghiggino. The need for extended travel between locations, in order to complete mundane tasks, was criticized. The episode's writing was lauded by reviewers; particular praise was bestowed on the chapter's opening scene, which introduces Morgan LeFlay. Nevertheless, the story was disparaged by Reuben Lees of the "<a href="Herald%20Sun">Herald Sun</a>" for feeling "more like a bridge to open up further plotlines in the later episodes", a point echoed by other reviewers. While the supporting cast was again criticized, reviewers enjoyed the development of the main characters' roles. Critics admired the chapter's audio work, with Dickens calling Kevin Blackton's rendition of the human LeChuck a "real standout". Graphical tweaks over "The Launch of the "Screaming Narwhal"" were also appreciated.

Critics considered "Lair of the Leviathan" to be stronger than the previous chapters; on the review aggregator sites <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a> and <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, its Windows version holds the highest rating out of all "Tales of Monkey Island" episodes. The episode's puzzles were commended; <a href="IGN">IGN's</a> Steve Butts opined that Telltale's puzzle design had "moved forward quite a bit", compared to both preceding chapters and their earlier "Sam & Max" games. One puzzle in particular, involving pirates holding a face-pulling contest, was praised by reviewers. Dickens described the chapter's story as "strong [and] advancing", and Ghiggino felt that it "continued the fine "Monkey Island" tradition of being bizarre, hilarious and pretty interesting". Several reviews drew comparisons to the 1883 book "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Pinocchio">The Adventures of Pinocchio</a>", due to the game's setting inside a giant manatee. The episode's writing received near unanimous praise, and response to the supporting cast was much improved over the preceding episodes; praise centered particularly around Murray, a demonic, disembodied skull. Criticism of "Lair of the Leviathan" primarily focused on the chapter's brevity and lack of varied locations.

Reviewers were more ambivalent toward the fourth episode, "The Trial and Execution of Guybrush Threepwood". Reception of its puzzles was mixed; Ghiggino described many as "frustrating for the wrong reasons", and Dickens, while praising several as "challenging and creative", believed that there were "definite misfires". Butts criticized the "arbitrary design" of several puzzles, but noted that they were "exactly what we've come to expect from the series". Nevertheless, the episode's titular trial sequence was lauded. Reaction to the chapter's plot was mostly positive, with Eduardo Reboucas of Game Revolution commenting that it "moves along at a steady pace, and ends with a dramatic bang", and "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>"s Nick Francis praising the "emotional storylines weaving between some of the characters". Several reviews praised the twists in the story, although Adventure Classic Gaming's Mark Newheiser opined that the darker turn late in the episode was detrimental to the otherwise light-hearted series. The episode's writing was praised, as was the use of returning "Monkey Island" character Stan as the trial's prosecutor. Critics were divided over the effectiveness of reusing the setting of "Launch of the "Screaming Narwhal"".

The final episode, "Rise of the Pirate God", was thought by critics to be a fitting end to the series. Response to the chapter's puzzles was mostly positive, though several reviewers maintained reservations about the difficulty and innovation of many of them. The level design, which requires players to backtrack between locations, was not well received. The chapter's climactic battle was thought to be sufficient, though timing issues caused GameCritics' Tera Kirk to describe it as "almost as frustrating as it is clever". Nevertheless, the story received strong praise, particularly for the role reversal between Guybrush and LeChuck; Destructoid's Anthony Burch noted that the chapter "completely and intentionally inverts ["Monkey Island"s] own cliches". Similarly, the writing and dialogue were commended, as was the voice acting, with critics praising Earl Boen's reprisal of the demon LeChuck and Armato's work as Guybrush. Reviewers complimented the graphics for both the ghostly "Crossroads" and the fire-ravaged real world; Butts expressed that "the levels all benefit from great color choices and fantastic lighting effects that really support the mood".

"Tales of Monkey Island" received awards and award nominations from video game industry publications. Following the game's announcement at E3 2009, IGN named it the "Biggest Surprise" for the PC at the convention, and it was a finalist for GameSpot's Best Adventure Game of E3 award. IGN later nominated the first and third chapters as the best Wii and PC adventure games of the year, respectively. <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a> gave the game an honorable mention on its list of the year's best PC games; on their list of the top developers of the year, the site also presented Telltale Games with an honorable mention. "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>" nominated "Tales of Monkey Island" for their awards for overall game of the year, best WiiWare game and best adventure game; the publication gave Morgan LeFlay the award for the year's best character. Listing the best and worst video games of 2009, "<a href="OC%20Weekly">OC Weekly</a>" named "Tales of Monkey Island" the "Best Series Revival" of the year. <a href="About.com">About.com</a> considered the game to be the second best Wii game of the year, and "<a href="PC%20Gamer%20US">PC Gamer US</a>" awarded it "Adventure Game of the Year".
