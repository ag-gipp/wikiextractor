Paul Palaiologos Tagaris

Paul Palaiologos Tagaris (, – after 1394) was a <a href="Byzantine%20Greeks">Byzantine Greek</a> monk and impostor. A scion of the Tagaris family, Paul also claimed a somewhat dubious connection with the <a href="Palaiologos">Palaiologos</a> dynasty that ruled the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> at the time. He fled his marriage as a teenager and became a monk, but soon his fraudulent practices embroiled him in scandal. Fleeing <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, he traveled widely, from <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a> to <a href="Persia">Persia</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Georgia">Georgia</a> and eventually, via <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> and <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> to <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="Latin%20Greece">Latin Greece</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Cyprus">Cyprus</a> and <a href="France">France</a>.

During his long and tumultuous career, Paul was appointed an Orthodox bishop, sold ordinations to ecclesiastical offices, pretended to be the <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Patriarch%20of%20Jerusalem">Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem</a>, switched from <a href="Greek%20Orthodoxy">Greek Orthodoxy</a> to <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a> and back again, supported both the <a href="See%20of%20Rome">See of Rome</a> and the <a href="Avignon%20Papacy">Avignon anti-popes</a> in the <a href="Western%20Schism">Western Schism</a>, and managed to be named <a href="Latin%20Patriarch%20of%20Constantinople">Latin Patriarch of Constantinople</a>. In the end, his deceptions unmasked, he returned to Constantinople, where he repented and confessed his sins before a <a href="synod">synod</a> in 1394.

The main source on Paul's life is the document of his confession before the patriarchal synod in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, which is undated, but included among documents of the years 1394–1395. It was published in modern times by Franz Ritter von Miklosich and Joseph Muller (eds.), "Acta et Diplomata Græca medii ævi sacra et profana", Vol. II, "Acta Patriarchatus Constantinopolitanæ", Vienna 1860. The confession is complemented by an account of his visit to Paris in 1390, written by a monk of the <a href="Abbey%20of%20Saint-Denis">Abbey of Saint-Denis</a> and included in the anonymous "<a href="Chronique%20du%20religieux%20de%20Saint-Denys%2C%20contenant%20le%20r%C3%A8gne%20de%20Charles%20VI%20de%201380%20%C3%A0%201422">Chronique du religieux de Saint-Denys, contenant le règne de Charles VI de 1380 à 1422</a>".

Paul Tagaris was apparently a scion of the Tagaris family, a lineage which first appears in the early 14th century. His father is unnamed, but is described by Paul as a valiant and famous soldier, so that he is possibly identifiable either with the "<a href="megas%20stratopedarches">megas stratopedarches</a>" <a href="Manuel%20Tagaris">Manuel Tagaris</a>, or with the latter's son, <a href="George%20Tagaris">George Tagaris</a>. Paul Tagaris claimed to be related to the ruling imperial dynasty of the <a href="Palaiologoi">Palaiologoi</a> and adopted the surname for himself. Manuel Tagaris was indeed married to Theodora Asanina Palaiologina, daughter of <a href="Ivan%20Asen%20III%20of%20Bulgaria">Ivan Asen III of Bulgaria</a>, and niece of Emperor <a href="Andronikos%20II%20Palaiologos">Andronikos II Palaiologos</a>, but even if Paul was Manuel's son, Theodora was, according to the Byzantinist <a href="Donald%20Nicol">Donald Nicol</a>, "almost certainly not the mother of Paul".

According to Nicol, Tagaris was probably born in the 1320s, while other modern sources like the "<a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20Byzantium">Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium</a>" and the "<a href="Prosopographisches%20Lexikon%20der%20Palaiologenzeit">Prosopographisches Lexikon der Palaiologenzeit</a>" put it later, around the year 1340. His parents arranged his marriage at the age of 14 or 15, but soon he abandoned his wife and left Constantinople to become a monk in <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>. After a while he returned to Constantinople, where he quickly became embroiled in scandal: he claimed that an icon in his possession had miraculous properties, and made money out of gullible believers. This affair scandalized his family, but Patriarch <a href="Patriarch%20Callistus%20I%20of%20Constantinople">Kallistos I</a> declined to take action against him. It was not until the patriarch went on a visit to Serbia in July 1363 that his "<a href="locum%20tenens">locum tenens</a>", the <a href="hieromonk">hieromonk</a> Dorotheos, confiscated the icon and forced Paul to return to Palestine.

In Palestine, Paul was able to secure his ordination as a <a href="deacon">deacon</a> by the <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Patriarch%20of%20Jerusalem">Patriarch of Jerusalem</a> Lazaros, who took him under his protection (ca. 1364). Shortly after, Lazaros left for Constantinople, and his "locum tenens" Damianos brought charges against Paul, who was forced to abandon Jerusalem for <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>. In Antioch, Paul once again managed to befriend an influential figure, the newly elected (1368) <a href="Greek%20Patriarch%20of%20Antioch">Patriarch</a> Michael, who not only ordained him a priest, but eventually made him patriarchal <a href="exarch">exarch</a> and administrator of the Patriarchate's affairs. It was not long before Paul began abusing his authority: he sacked serving bishops and put their sees up for sale, threatening to report those who complained to the Turkish authorities. Soon he claimed the title of Patriarch of Jerusalem for himself and began to ordain bishops, even in territories subject to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. In 1370, he went to <a href="Iconium">Iconium</a> and then to <a href="Persia">Persia</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Georgia">Georgia</a>, where, according to his own recollection, he adjudicated a dispute among three rival claimants of the throne, finding in favour of the highest bidder. No such dispute is recorded in Georgian sources at this time.

At this point, again according to his own account, he felt remorse and considered returning to Constantinople, where he would give the fortune he had amassed to the poor, but he was forestalled by the Bishop of <a href="Tyre%2C%20Lebanon">Tyre</a> and <a href="Sidon">Sidon</a>, who found him and delivered an offer by the Patriarch of Antioch to name him bishop of Taurezion (an unidentified location, suggested as being either in the <a href="Taurus%20Mountains">Taurus Mountains</a> or in the <a href="Tauric%20peninsula">Tauric peninsula</a>, i.e. the Crimea). Paul accepted, and was apparently consecrated by the Bishop of Tyre and Sidon (). At the same time, the Patriarch of Constantinople <a href="Patriarch%20Philotheus%20I%20of%20Constantinople">Philotheos I Kokkinos</a> heard about his dealings in the east, and at <a href="Trabzon">Trebizond</a> Paul was met by a messenger from the Patriarch who demanded his immediate return to Constantinople to stand trial.

Reluctant to face the Patriarch's wrath, Paul once more decided to flee, and try his luck in Rome. As Nicol points out, such a move would be highly unusual for an Orthodox priest, but may be explained by his family's links with pro-Catholic circles in the Byzantine capital: George Tagaris, his putative brother or father, was among those who supported the Union of the Churches and had received letters of encouragement from <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20VI">Pope Innocent VI</a>. To avoid passing near Constantinople, Paul was forced to make a broad detour. He took a ship, probably from Trebizond, to the Crimea, where he presented the local governor of the <a href="Golden%20Horde">Golden Horde</a> with jewels from the treasure he had amassed. In exchange, he received an escort through the Horde lands (modern <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>) to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Kingdom of Hungary</a>, and thence to Rome. There he secured an audience with <a href="Pope%20Urban%20VI">Pope Urban VI</a>, claiming to be the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem. Paul presented himself to the Pope as a penitent, offered a confession, and embraced the Catholic faith. Impressed by Paul's humble demeanour, the Pope named him (in late 1379 or early 1380) to the titular post of <a href="Latin%20Patriarch%20of%20Constantinople">Latin Patriarch of Constantinople</a>, which had been vacant since September 1378, when its incumbent, <a href="Giacomo%20da%20Itri">Giacomo da Itri</a>, had declared his allegiance to the <a href="Avignon%20Papacy">Avignon anti-pope</a> <a href="Antipope%20Clement%20VII">Clement VII</a>. Urban also named Paul <a href="apostolic%20legate">apostolic legate</a> for all countries "east of <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durazzo</a>".

After his appointment as a "second Pope", as he called it, Paul abandoned his simple <a href="monastic%20habit">monastic habit</a> and adopted magnificent <a href="vestment">vestment</a>s to suit his new rank, wore ostentatious jewellery, and, according to the chronicler of Saint-Denis, went about on horseback surrounded by a magnificently outfitted entourage. A likely example of Paul's splendid vestments and accoutrements at this time is a richly embroidered altar cloth, featuring a Byzantine <a href="double-headed%20eagle">double-headed eagle</a> with a monogram on its breast and the legend "Paul, Patriarch of Constantinople and New Rome" in Greek, now in the collection of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>.

Since Constantinople had been recovered by the Byzantines in 1261, the seat of the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople had been since 1314 at <a href="Chalcis">Negroponte</a>, which still remained in <a href="Triarchy%20of%20Negroponte">Latin hands</a>. Soon after his investment, Paul stopped in <a href="Ancona">Ancona</a> on his way to Greece. He remained in the city for several weeks, fêted by the locals, and presented them with purported <a href="relic">relic</a>s: on 4 March 1380 the head of <a href="James%20the%20Just">James the Just</a>, followed on 17 April by the foot of <a href="Saint%20Anne">Saint Anne</a> and a nail from the <a href="True%20Cross">True Cross</a>. As Nicol comments, "one may be tempted to question the authenticity, and still more the provenance, of his donation". The documents of grant, preserved in the cathedral of Ancona, are signed by Paul and a certain "Alexios Palaiologos the <a href="Despot%20%28court%20title%29">Despot</a>", allegedly a son of the Byzantine emperor but in reality, according to Nicol, probably "another figment of Paul's fertile imagination".

From 1380 until 1384, Paul remained at his see in Negroponte. A relative of his, George Tagaris—probably a different person than Manuel Tagaris' son—was called in to help with the administration of the patriarchal domains. His tenure was troubled, as the local Orthodox clergy appealed to the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venetian</a> authorities for protection against his exactions, while the <a href="Latin%20Archbishop%20of%20Athens">Latin Archbishop of Athens</a>, <a href="Antonio%20Ballester">Antonio Ballester</a>, complained of the Patriarch's interference in his diocese. Furthermore, his lease of some of the Church lands in 1383 to a Venetian from <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, Giacomo Grimani, proved a source of protracted legal trouble since Grimani, in the words of the French medievalist <a href="Raymond-Joseph%20Loenertz">Raymond-Joseph Loenertz</a>, "revealed himself as much a scoundrel as the Patriarch". In 1384, Paul was once again denounced as an impostor to the Pope, possibly by Ballester, who was named <a href="vicar-general">vicar-general</a> of the Patriarchate in the same year, and who had held the same office during the 1378–1379 vacancy. Paul had apparently left his diocese before his denunciation, and resumed his wanderings. In 1385, he was in <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, where he crowned <a href="James%20I%20of%20Cyprus">James of Lusignan</a> as <a href="King%20of%20Cyprus">King of Cyprus</a> in exchange for 30,000 gold coins, and continued granting ecclesiastical appointments on the island as if he were still patriarch.
In 1388 he returned to Rome, possibly hoping that the accusations against him had been forgotten in the meanwhile. He was arrested, tried and imprisoned, but was released after Urban VI's death in October 1389 and the general amnesty granted by the new pope, <a href="Pope%20Boniface%20IX">Boniface IX</a>. Leaving Rome, Paul went to the court of <a href="Amadeus%20VII%20of%20Savoy">Amadeus VII of Savoy</a>. There he presented himself as a distant relative to the Count—a claim likely relying on his tenuous links to the Palaiologoi, who in turn were remotely linked to the House of Savoy via Empress <a href="Anna%20of%20Savoy">Anna of Savoy</a>, Amadeus VII's great-aunt—and as a victim of papal persecution on account of his support for the Avignon papacy. Paul's claims of kinship were dubious, but Amadeus was moved by the plight of a fellow Avignon supporter, and accepted him as the legitimate Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. He provided Paul with money and an escort of twelve horses and twelve servants, and sent him on to the papal court of Avignon.

Paul received a magnificent welcome at Avignon, where he was fêted by Clement VII and his cardinals. Clement, moved by his guest's tales of suffering at the hands of the Roman popes, loaded him with gifts and honours and sent him north to Paris. There, King <a href="Charles%20VI%20of%20France">Charles VI of France</a> likewise prepared a triumphal welcome for his illustrious guest. Paul was an exotic and popular sight in the French capital, and was lavishly hosted and entertained. He obviously enjoyed his long sojourn there, "safe in a place where his past was unknown and his deception was unlikely to be discovered", according to Nicol. For further safety, he communicated only via an interpreter in his employ. On his visit to the Abbey of Saint-Denis, he claimed that there were several relics of the <a href="Denis">abbey's patron saint</a>—commonly confused with the Athenian saint <a href="Dionysius%20the%20Areopagite">Dionysius the Areopagite</a> at the time—to be found back in Greece, and promised to help the monks bring them to France. His proposal was enthusiastically taken up, and two monks received permission and funds from the king to accompany Paul back to Greece. When the party arrived in the port in Italy from which they would sail for Greece, however, Paul bribed the captain of the ship to pretend that bad weather would delay their departure. In the same night, he and his servants set sail with their entire baggage, leaving the two monks behind. It was only in Rome, where the monks went in search of answers for Paul's behaviour, that they learned the true identity of their travelling companion. From them the chronicler of the abbey later received his information.

According to Nicol, the achievement of the "accomplished sinner" Paul was without parallel: "No-one ever made such a profitable business out of changing sides, first in the <a href="Schism%20of%201054">schism</a> between the Greek and Latin Churches, and then in the <a href="Western%20Schism">schism</a> between the pope in Rome and the pope in Avignon. It is no mean feat to arrive in Rome as Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem and then to be received in Avignon as Catholic patriarch of Constantinople."

Now, though, having irreparably destroyed his reputation and ties with both papal courts, Paul was left with no option other than to return to Constantinople. In 1394, he was back in the Byzantine capital, where he appeared before Patriarch <a href="Patriarch%20Antony%20IV%20of%20Constantinople">Antony IV</a>, before whom he confessed his sins, abjured his conversion to Catholicism, and pleaded for mercy. As Nicol writes, "Only on one point did he protest that he had been wrongfully accused; for, despite rumours and tales contrived against him, he had never indulged in fornication, miracle-mongering, or the practice of magic". The Patriarch passed Paul's case on to the full patriarchal synod, before which Paul was obliged to repeat his confession twice, and then once more before an assembly of the people. The records of these sessions, kept by the patriarchal scribe Perdikes, are the main source on Paul's life. The final portion of the manuscript, containing the verdict, is missing, but both the synod and the people had recommended a pardon, so it is likely that he was forgiven. His subsequent life is unknown.

SS Arctic disaster

The <a href="paddle%20steamer">paddle steamer</a> , owned by the <a href="Collins%20Line">Collins Line</a> of New York, sank on September 27, 1854, after a collision with , a much smaller vessel, off the coast of <a href="Newfoundland%20Colony">Newfoundland</a>. Passenger and crew lists indicate that there were probably more than 400 on board; of these, only 88 survived, most of whom were members of the crew. All the women and children on board perished.

"Arctic" was the largest and most celebrated of the four Collins steamers that had operated a regular transatlantic passenger and mail carrying service since 1850. After the collision "Arctic"s captain, James Luce, first attempted to assist the stricken "Vesta", which he believed was in imminent danger of sinking. When he discovered that his own ship had been seriously holed below the waterline, he decided to run her towards the nearest land, in the hopes of reaching safety. His plan failed; the engines stopped when the ship was still a considerable distance from land. "Arctic"s lifeboat capacity was sufficient for less than half of those on board; when Luce ordered these launched, a breakdown in order and discipline meant that most places in the boats were taken by members of the crew or the more able-bodied male passengers. The rest struggled to build makeshift rafts, but most were unable to leave the ship, and went down with her when she sank, four hours after the collision. "Vesta", which initially appeared to have sustained mortal damage, was kept afloat by her watertight bulkheads, and managed to limp into harbor at <a href="St.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland">St. John's, Newfoundland</a>.

Two of the six lifeboats that left "Arctic" reached the Newfoundland shore safely, and another was picked up by a passing steamer, which also rescued a few survivors from improvised rafts. Among those saved was Captain Luce, who had regained the surface after initially going down with the ship. The other three lifeboats disappeared without a trace. The limited telegraph facilities of the time meant that news of "Arctic"s loss did not reach New York until two weeks after the sinking. Initial public sorrow at the ship's loss quickly turned to anger at the perceived cowardice of the crew. Despite press calls for a full investigation into the disaster, none took place, and nobody was held legally responsible. Demands for the introduction of further safety measures on passenger-carrying vessels were likewise sidestepped. Luce, who was generally exonerated from blame by the public, retired from the sea; some of the surviving crew chose not to return to the U.S. The Collins Line continued its transatlantic service, until further maritime losses and insolvency led to its closure in 1858.

In the second quarter of the 19th century the transatlantic shipping trade was revolutionized by the development of long-range steamships. The transition from sail was gradual; shipowners were initially influenced by popular theories that ships could not carry sufficient coal to traverse the ocean. This notion was disproved in 1838, by the almost simultaneous crossings of <a href="Isambard%20Kingdom%20Brunel">Isambard Kingdom Brunel</a>'s giant paddle steamer and the American . "Great Western" completed the crossing, from <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> to New York, in 14 days and 12 hours; under sail, westbound passages against the prevailing winds and current often took five weeks or more.

The first shipping line to begin regular transatlantic steamer services was the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, better known as the <a href="Cunard%20Line">Cunard Line</a> in recognition of its founder, the Canadian <a href="Samuel%20Cunard">Samuel Cunard</a>. It began its operations on July 4, 1840, when left <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> for <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, via <a href="Halifax%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>. As the principal transatlantic mail carrier, the Cunard Line received subsidies from the British government and from the <a href="United%20States%20Post%20Office%20Department">United States Post Office Department</a>, the latter a point that rankled with some Americans, who felt that a home-owned line should be the beneficiary. Senator <a href="James%20A.%20Bayard%2C%20Jr.">James A. Bayard</a> of <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a> was among those urging Congress to subsidize a U.S. steamship line: "America will soon become tired of being informed of British maritime supremacy ... I suggest that Congress grant a carefully selected American shipping expert a completely free hand to proceed with the absolute conquest of this man Cunard". In 1845 the <a href="United%20States%20Postmaster%20General">postmaster general</a> invited tenders for a transatlantic mail contract. The successful bidder, announced on March 3, 1847, was New York shipowner <a href="Edward%20Knight%20Collins">Edward Knight Collins</a>.

With government subsidies promised, initially at $385,000 a year, and with the backing of the leading investment bank <a href="Brown%20Bros.%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Brown Brothers</a>, Collins founded the New York and Liverpool United States' Mail Steamship Company, familiarly known as the <a href="Collins%20Line">Collins Line</a>. He immediately embarked on an ambitious steamship construction program. The first of the four Collins Line ships, , was launched in 1849 and began service in April 1850. Her three sister ships, , and , were all in service before the end of 1850. The four, all constructed of wood, were broadly similar in size and performance; "Arctic" was marginally the largest, at in length and 2,856 <a href="Builder%27s%20Old%20Measurement%23American%20tons%20burthen">tons</a> by American custom house measurement. The new Collins Line steamers were about 25 percent larger than the biggest of the Cunard ships, and were soon outperforming them; crossings in ten days became routine. "Arctic" entered service on October 26, 1850. The luxurious standards of its passenger accommodation contrasted with those experienced by <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, who crossed the Atlantic in Cunard's "Britannia" in 1840. Dickens found his "Britannia" cabin dark and cramped, "a thoroughly hopeless, and profoundly preposterous box", while the bleak saloon was "a long narrow apartment, not unlike a gigantic hearse". In "Arctic", according to a seasoned transatlantic passenger, her cabins "in comfort and elegance surpassed that of any merchant vessel Great Britain then possessed", while the main saloon had "an air of almost Oriental magnificence".

Under her captain, James Luce, a 49-year-old veteran of thirty years at sea, "Arctic" became the most celebrated of the Collins ships. Her record eastbound crossing, from New York to Liverpool in nine days, seventeen hours in the winter of 1851–52, earned her the title of the "Clipper of the Seas". Luce was admired by passengers as much for his social qualities as for his seamanship; a reporter for "Harper's New Monthly Magazine" wrote approvingly: "If you ever wish to cross the Atlantic, you will find in the "Arctic" one of the noblest of ships, and in Captain Luce one of the best of commanders".

At about midday on September 20, 1854, "Arctic" left Liverpool for New York, carrying between 250 and 300 passengers (including at least 100 women and young children), and about 150 in crew. Among the passengers was Mrs. Edward Collins, wife of the line's founder, who was traveling with her 19-year-old daughter and 15-year-old son, together with her brother and his wife. Another party was formed by members of the Brown banking family: William Benedict Brown, son of the bank's president, was accompanied by his wife Clara, their two infant children, and two of William's sisters. A further passenger was Luce's partially disabled 11-year-old son, William Robert, whose health the captain thought might benefit from the round trip.

"Arctic" passed <a href="Cape%20Clear%20Island">Cape Clear</a>, at the southernmost point of Ireland, early on the morning of September 21, and entered the open Atlantic approaching her maximum speed of . In settled weather she progressed uneventfully, and early on September 27 had reached the <a href="Grand%20Banks">Grand Banks</a>, off the coast of <a href="Newfoundland%20Colony">Newfoundland</a>. This area is formed by a series of relatively shallow submarine plateaus forming part of the Canadian <a href="continental%20shelf">continental shelf</a>. Here, the sub-Arctic waters of the <a href="Labrador%20Current">Labrador Current</a> meet the warm northbound waters of the <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a>, to create weather systems typified by intermittent mists and fog. It was the practice for steamers to maintain maximum speeds in these conditions, although before electronic aids to navigation the risk of collision was considerable. Keeping schedules was considered paramount, particularly in the Collins Line where, Alexander Brown states in his 1962 account, "there was no room for overcautious shipmasters". On the morning of September 27, Luce observed typical Grand Banks conditions: "at intervals of a few minutes a very dense fog, followed by being sufficiently clear to see one or two miles."

At noon on September 27, Luce calculated the ship's position at roughly south-east of <a href="Cape%20Race">Cape Race</a>, in Newfoundland. Shortly afterwards, as "Arctic" slipped into a bank of fog, the lookout saw the shape of a steamer bearing down at a rate of around 10 knots. He gave the warning; the officer of the watch commanded "Hard-a-starboard", and ordered the engine room to stop and reverse. In the chartroom, the captain heard these orders and returned to the deck, just as "Arctic" was struck by the advancing steamer on the <a href="starboard">starboard</a> side, between the bow and the paddle wheel. Luce's first impression was that his ship was "relatively uninjured", and to most of those on board, the bump seemed slight. Many of the passengers were gathered in the cabin prior to lunch, and some of them were engaged in drawing the numbers of the daily lottery, based on the number of miles run in the preceding twenty-four hours.

In the saloon, passenger William Gihon "perceived a slight shock, although it was scarcely more than a tremor or a quiver". He continued his conversation with a fellow-passenger: "Neither of us entertained any idea at that time that the "Arctic" had sustained injury".

The steamer which had collided with "Arctic" was , an iron-hulled propeller-driven French ship used by a major fishing operator to ferry its employees to and from their center of operations at <a href="Saint%20Pierre%20Island">Saint Pierre Island</a>, <a href="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a>. To those on "Arctic"s deck, "Vesta" appeared to be fatally damaged; Luce thought her bows "seemed to be literally cut or crushed off for full ten feet". His first reaction, believing his own ship almost untouched, was to assist "Vesta", on which scenes of panic and chaos among the 200-odd sailors and fishermen aboard her were evident. He ordered his chief officer, Robert Gourlay, to lower one of "Arctic"s six lifeboats with a crew of six, and to ascertain what help could be offered; meanwhile, "Arctic" slowly circled the stricken vessel. Gourlay's boat was quickly away, and another was prepared for launching, under second officer William Baalham, but before this could be done Luce rescinded the order. He had noticed a change in the movement of "Arctic"s paddle wheels through the water and saw also that the ship was listing, signs of potentially serious damage. Baalham was ordered to make a closer inspection of the point of impact; he found that debris from "Vesta"s iron <a href="Stem%20%28ship%29">stem</a> and anchor were impaled in the woodwork of "Arctic"s hull, creating substantial holes about eighteen inches above the water-line. Two breaches were below the waterline, admitting large quantities of water. Unlike "Vesta", "Arctic" was not equipped with watertight compartments; the hull was open from stem to stern.

As Baalham made his inspection, others observed the extent of the damage, and a mood of concern and anxiety began to develop as news spread. With the ship's four pumps working at full capacity, Luce attempted to stanch the leak by passing a large canvas sail over the ship's bow. This, he hoped, could be fastened over the holes in the hull to lessen the inflow of water, but the jagged iron debris protruding from the hull quickly tore the sail apart. The ship's carpenter tried to stuff the breaches with mattresses and other materials, but the holes were by then too far below the waterline to be reached. Realizing that his ship was in serious danger of sinking, Luce decided to run for the nearest land, in the hopes of reaching safety while "Arctic" was still afloat; Cape Race was about four hours distant, if the ship could be kept moving. This decision meant abandoning "Vesta", but Luce rationalized that the French vessel was likely to sink at any moment, and that remaining with her might well condemn his own passengers and crew to the same fate. After vainly attempting to signal his intention to Gourlay and his crew, who were being left to fend for themselves, Luce ordered full speed ahead. A few minutes later, "Arctic" ploughed into a lifeboat that had been launched from "Vesta". All but one of its dozen occupants were killed, mostly crushed under "Arctic"s paddle wheels. The single survivor was a fisherman, François Jassonet, who jumped clear and was hauled aboard "Arctic" by a rope.

As the water in "Arctic"s hull continued to rise, outstripping the pumps, the boiler fires were gradually extinguished. By one o'clock the ship was scarcely moving. Still far from land, and with no help nearby, Luce ordered that the ship's lifeboats be prepared for launching, In accordance with the governing maritime regulations, "Arctic" carried six steel-constructed boats, one of which had departed with Gourlay. The five remaining boats could safely hold 150 persons, well under half of those on board but with more than enough places to hold all the women and children. Under the charge of the ship's quartermaster, women and children were placed in the <a href="port%20and%20starboard">port</a> guard boat, but as this orderly process proceeded, a group of male passengers and crew members rushed forward to claim the remaining places, and the boat was filled. Although ordered by the captain to remain alongside, it was rowed rapidly away.
On board "Arctic", disquiet turned increasingly into panic as it became clear that lifeboat capacity was inadequate. Shortly after the port guard boat's departure, the port quarter boat, with around twelve women and five crew aboard, was being readied for lowering into the water when it, too, was rushed by members of the crew. In the general melee the boat was upended, sending all but three of its occupants into the water, where they drowned. On the other side of the ship, Luce ordered Second Officer Baalham to launch the starboard guard boat and proceed with it to the <a href="stern">stern</a>, where women and children passengers would be passed down. No sooner was it launched when it was overwhelmed by men, who leapt into the water and clambered into the boat; all but one of these were crew members. With his boat now full, Baalham disregarded Luce's instructions to pick up women and children, and drifted away. Meanwhile, the upended port quarter boat had been righted, but despite Luce's efforts to give women passengers priority, it was again rushed by crew and male passengers, who thrust aside the waiting women and cut the boat adrift from the ship while it was only partially filled.

While the captain's attention was fully occupied in vain attempts to impose order, a group of the ship's engineers, led by Chief Engineer J. W. Rogers, quietly appropriated one of the two remaining lifeboats. They maintained they required the boat for a final attempt at plugging the leaks; anyone who questioned their intentions, or attempted to board the boat, was threatened with firearms. With ample food and water, this boat left the ship half full, occupied entirely by engine room staff. Of the ship's officers only Luce and Fourth Officer Francis Dorian now remained; virtually all the engineers and seamen had left. Around 300 people were still on board, with a single lifeboat. As a final measure to give at least some of them a chance of survival, Luce ordered the building of a raft. The fore and main <a href="Yard%20%28sailing%29">yardarms</a>, with various beams, <a href="Spar%20%28sailing%29">spars</a> and other wooden artifacts, were collected and lowered into the sea where Dorian, in the remaining boat, attempted to supervise the raft's construction. Despite Dorian's entreaties, his boat was rapidly overwhelmed; to save it he cut loose, leaving a final terrified scramble for whatever security the half-finished raft could provide. Among those who found safety in Dorian's boat was a fireman, Patrick Tobin. According to his later account: "It was every man for himself. No more attention was paid to the captain than to any other man on board. Life was as sweet to us as to others".

With "Arctic" dead in the water and all of the lifeboats gone, Captain Luce instructed a young trainee engineer, Stewart Holland of Washington, to station himself at the bow and to fire the ship's signal cannon at one-minute intervals, in the hope of attracting the attention of a passing vessel. Throughout the chaos of the ship's final minutes, Holland held his position and continued to fire until the moment the ship sank. Holland did not survive the sinking. His bravery and devotion to duty were noted in several later accounts: the "Baltimore Sun" called him "a conqueror of death. That noble ship had many noble spirits on board—but none nobler than he".

Luce refused to take any action to save himself—he had told Baalham, before the second officer's departure, that "the fate of the ship shall be mine". When he could no longer render assistance to those still on board, he climbed with his young son to his command post atop the starboard paddle box, and waited for the end. By this time, many on board had become resigned to their fate; they huddled together for comfort while some sang hymns or recited scripture. A few still frantically sought for means of survival; those who could not find a place on the raft lashed together anything that might float—chairs, stools, caskets, sofas and doors, while Holland continued to fire the cannon. Peter McCabe, a waiter on his first transatlantic voyage, later described the scene: "Several persons were floating about on doors and beds ... I seized hold of a door which had been taken down to save passengers, and went into the sea, where I left the door and got upon the raft ... A great many persons were trying to get on the raft ... Among the number who were on it I saw four ladies". Many were lost from the raft when it fouled the sinking hull—a section broke off, spilling its occupants into the sea. After this, McCabe counted seventy-two men and four women either on or clinging to the structure, as it moved slowly away from the ship.

At around 4:45 pm, four and a half hours after the collision, Holland fired the cannon for the final time, as "Arctic" sank stern-first. There were still perhaps 250 persons on board. As the ship went down, Paul Grann from New York, in Dorian's boat, heard "one fearful shriek, and saw the passengers swept forward against the smokestack, and then all was over". Luce, holding tightly to his child, was dragged deep down by the suction of the sinking vessel. When he rose to the surface, "a most awful and heart-rending scene presented itself to my view—over two hundred men, women and children struggling together amidst pieces of wreck of every kind, calling on each other for help, and imploring God to assist them. Such an appalling scene may God preserve me from ever witnessing again." As he struggled, a section of one of "Arctic"s paddle-boxes rose to the surface, delivering him a glancing blow but striking and killing his son outright. Despite the shock, Luce was able to clamber on to the paddle-box, which provided a temporary raft for him and eleven others.

A short distance from the foundering ship, Baalham's boat encountered the partly filled port quarter boat. The loads were equalized, and the two vessels, with 45 persons in all, agreed to proceed under Baalham's overall command. After briefly considering—and rejecting—a suggestion that they should look for other survivors, the two unprovisioned boats began rowing in the direction of the Newfoundland coast. Without an adequate compass, Baalham navigated by the run of the sea and occasional glimpses of the stars. Many of these survivors were freezing through extensive immersion in the cold water, about ; nevertheless, they rowed through the night and the next day. Twice they sighted ships in the distance, but were not seen. Early on the morning of September 29 they were close to the shoreline of Newfoundland's <a href="Avalon%20Peninsula">Avalon Peninsula</a>, and shortly afterwards the two boats landed at <a href="Renews-Cappahayden%23Cappahayden">Broad Cove</a>, about south of <a href="St.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">St John's</a>.
After a brief respite, the party moved on to <a href="Renews-Cappahayden">Renews</a>, a fishing village four miles (six km) to the north. There, "Arctic"s purser, John Geib, wrote a short message for dispatch by courier to the American consul in St John's, informing him of the collision. Baalham hired two schooners; in one, he returned with two others to the location of the sinking, to search for other survivors. In the other, the rest of the group sailed for St John's. When they arrived, during the afternoon of October 2, they were surprised to find "Vesta", safely moored in the harbor. Despite the serious damage to its bow, "Vesta"s watertight bulkheads had held firm, enabling the ship to proceed slowly to St John's with almost her complete complement on board. Her arrival, on September 30, had provided the basis of the first, inaccurate report of the disaster, in the local "Patriot and Terra Nova Herald" newspaper, in which it was assumed that "Arctic" had survived. The "Arctic" survivors' reception in St John's was cool, as following "Vesta"s arrival the perception had been that "Arctic" had displayed what William Flayhart, in his account of the disaster, terms a "hit and run" attitude.

Baalham arrived on October 3, following a fruitless three-day search for survivors. The text of Geib's brief letter to the American consul appeared in that day's edition of the St John's "Newfoundlander", while its rival newspaper "The Public Ledger" printed a more detailed account of the disaster provided by Baalham. Because St John's lacked a telegraph service, these reports had to be taken by the steamer "Merlin" to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where they could be wired to New York. Most of the "Arctic" party traveled on the same steamer; Geib remained in St John's, on the chance that further survivors might arrive. "Merlin" detoured to cover the area of the sinking, but discovered nothing; she then proceeded to <a href="Sydney%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Sydney, Nova Scotia</a> and reached Halifax on October 11.

Numerous efforts were launched from St John's in the hope of finding more survivors. An English schooner, "John Clements", spent a week searching, before returning with "Arctic"s flagstaff but no personnel. The New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company, owners of the steamer "Victoria", offered their vessel to the U.S. consul for a fee of $500 a day, an action which led to considerable criticism from the local press. By contrast, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Newfoundland">Bishop of Newfoundland</a>, the Right Revd <a href="Edward%20Feild">Edward Feild</a>, provided his private yacht "Hawk" free of charge. Eventually "Victoria" agreed to assist without payment, although an unnamed correspondent of the "Public Ledger" doubted whether the ship made more than a perfunctory search. None of the ships other than "John Clements" found any definite traces of "Arctic". Some reported that they had sighted debris, but were not able to identify or recover it.

Dorian's lifeboat was the smallest of the ship's boats and, with 26 crew and 5 passengers on board, had only a few inches of <a href="Freeboard%20%28nautical%29">freeboard</a>. In worsening weather, Dorian improvised a rough <a href="sea%20anchor">sea anchor</a>, which enabled the boat to ride the waves through the night and following day without being swamped. In the late afternoon of September 28 they sighted a distant sail, which proved to be the Canadian <a href="barque">bark</a> "Huron", bound for <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>. As they rowed towards their rescuer, they passed Peter McCabe, still clinging to the makeshift raft, the only one of its 72 occupants to have survived the night; he, too was taken on board "Huron". McCabe later recalled that he thought he was within ten minutes of death when he was rescued.

On the following day "Huron" encountered another sailing ship, the "Lebanon", heading for New York. Dorian, the five passengers and twelve of the crew chose to transfer to "Lebanon". The other crewmen, possibly anticipating a hostile reception in their home port, chose to remain with "Huron" and proceed to Quebec, where she arrived on October 13.

The ordeal of Captain Luce, and others who survived on assorted wreckage, lasted for two days. Around noon on September 29, the sailing ship "Cambria", out of <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> and heading for Quebec, spotted François Jassonet, the "Vesta" fisherman who had been rescued by the "Arctic" after the collision. In the following few hours, "Cambria" picked up nine more survivors; these included Luce and two companions, the only survivors of the eleven who had found refuge on the remains of the paddlebox. The last to be picked up by "Cambria" was James Smith, a businessman from Scotland, who had survived on a raft constructed from planking and a tin-lined wicker basket. He had seen at least one ship pass in the distance during his ordeal, and had almost given up hope when "Cambria" arrived. Once satisfied there were no further survivors in the area, "Cambria" continued its journey to Quebec. Luce spent much of the voyage preparing a report of the disaster, ready to wire to Edward Collins in New York as soon as he reached land. "Cambria" arrived in Quebec on October 13, a few hours after "Huron".

The fates of three of "Arctic"s lifeboats are unknown: the starboard quarter boat in which Gourlay left to assist "Vesta" just after the collision; the port guard boat, launched under the control of the quartermaster; and the forward deck boat, appropriated by Rogers and his associates. No trace of the occupants of these boats was ever found. In mid-November 1854, Gourlay's empty boat was picked up by the schooner "Lily Dale", in good condition and with its oars still inside. In mid-December the port guard boat was washed ashore at <a href="Placentia%20Bay">Placentia Bay</a>, Newfoundland, again with no indication of the fate of its occupants.

New York first heard of the disaster on October 11, with the arrival of the survivors rescued by the "Lebanon". Later that day, Baalham's report, telegraphed from Halifax, was received at the Collins offices. The men from the "Lebanon" were seized upon by the press; their stories, and the details from Baalham's wired account, formed the basis of the early newspaper accounts. At that stage, information was incomplete; Luce was missing and presumed lost, and there were various speculations about the numbers of casualties. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Herald">The New York Herald</a>"s headline announced: "Between Three and Four Hundred Souls Perished", and: "Only Thirty-two Lives Known to be Saved". On the basis of the sketchy telegraphs from Halifax, the "<a href="Baltimore%20Sun">Baltimore Sun</a>" printed the false story that "Vesta" had saved 31 from "Arctic"s complement and brought them into St John's. This confusion temporarily raised hopes that the number saved might be higher than was immediately apparent, but this hope was dashed when, on the following day, some of Baalham's party from St John's arrived in New York, via Halifax and Boston, with their more detailed accounts.

On October 13, Luce's telegraphed report from Quebec was received at the Collins New York office. The news of his survival was the cause of celebration and thanksgiving. In its first paragraph Luce informed Edward Collins that the lost passengers likely "included your wife, daughter and son, with whom I took a last leave the moment the ship was going down". That day, the "Baltimore Sun" reported the loss of the entire Brown party. Luce's account of the rushing of lifeboats, and the early departures of officers and crew, caused considerable consternation in New York, which quickly turned to anger and condemnation as it became apparent that no women or children had been saved, and that most of the survivors were from the crew. "The New York Times" reported "an entire lack of disciplined control over the whole of the ship", and that "the officers and crew did not do their best towards saving the vessel, which they left too early". Paul Grann, from Dorian's boat, reported that "all order and discipline ceased on board", and that Rogers had threatened passengers with firearms. Later press accounts condemned the crew in increasingly harsh terms; "The New York Times" referred to "a ghastly desertion of duty", and condemned the "cowardly and dastardly conduct of the crew". "Scientific American" adjudged that the behavior of the crew in saving themselves before their passengers had "blackened the character of our marine in the eyes of the whole world". Captain Luce, however, was largely exculpated; he had not sought to save himself, had gone down with his ship, and had survived largely by chance. When he arrived in New York by train from Quebec, on October 14, he was greeted as a hero.

The probable number of survivors from SS "Arctic" is 88, of whom 24 (including the French fisherman François Jassonet) were passengers. This figure includes 45 in Baalham's Newfoundland party, 32 rescued by "Huron", 10 picked up by "Cambria", and a passenger, Thomas Fleury, whose survival was not known until 1860. Alexander Brown names 85 survivors, but includes only 42 from Baalham's party. David Shaw, writing in 2002, gives the total who survived as 87, but does not count Fleury. In the absence of accurate passenger and crew lists, it has not been possible to establish the precise number of casualties; on the basis of published partial lists, Flayhart estimates the death toll as not less than 285, and conceivably as high as 372. Some accounts give inflated casualty figures; for example, W. H. Rideing in 1896 asserts that "five hundred and sixty-two persons perished".

After a week of reports chiefly concerned with survival accounts and tributes, on October 18 "The New York Times" turned to "Lessons Concerning Means of Security on Ocean Steamers". Among several recommendations were: the compulsory use of steam whistles or trumpets as fog signals; the construction of permanent watertight bulkheads in all passenger-carrying ships; organized lifeboat drills for passengers; better discipline and more training among seamen. Few of these suggested reforms were adopted immediately; calls for steamships sailing under the U.S. flag to carry sufficient lifeboats for everyone on board were resisted until after the loss of 58 years later. In December 1854 "The New York Times" called for an official enquiry into the disaster: "Whatever may be the extent of their legal responsibility, the owners, the officers and the crew of the "Arctic" are responsible to the public judgment ... They have no right to resist any attempt that may be made to define the extent of that responsibility, nor to deprecate any degree of scrutiny into their conduct". No such investigation was ever instituted, and no one was taken to court for their actions. Some of the crewmen who landed in Quebec avoided questions by not returning to the United States; according to Shaw they "disappeared on the waterfronts along the St Lawrence River and found the obscurity they wanted".

Luce never went to sea again. The sympathy that greeted him on his return to New York did not prevent later criticism, that he had not acted forcefully enough and had, according to the crewman Tobin, "seemed like a man whose judgment was paralyzed". The captain accepted that his abandonment of Gourlay had been a grave error; the first officer might well have supervised a more disciplined organization of the lifeboats. Luce took a post as an inspector of ships with the Great Western Marine Insurance Company, where he worked until his death in 1879, in his 75th year. His obituarist recorded that "his latter years were embittered by the recollection of the terrible disaster". The Collins Line continued its fortnightly transatlantic mail steamship service with its three remaining ships, but suffered a further blow when, in January 1856, SS "Pacific" sank with her entire complement of 186 passengers and crew. Nevertheless Collins went ahead with the construction of an even larger ship, the SS "Adriatic", which, after a single round trip in November–December 1857, was laid up. Confidence in the line had been damaged; "people concluded that getting there was more important than luxuriating amid ornate trim", and public opinion was increasingly averse to the payment of government subsidies to finance the Collins Line's extravagances. Early in 1858, when these subsidies were heavily cut back, the line ceased business, and the Cunard ships resumed their position of transatlantic supremacy. "Vesta", fully repaired, remained in the service of various owners until 1875 when, renamed "Amberes", she is recorded as sinking in <a href="Santander%2C%20Spain">Santander</a> harbor.

Among memorials to those lost from "Arctic", a stone pillar was erected next to Luce's grave, in the Center cemetery at <a href="Wareham%2C%20Massachusetts">Wareham, Massachusetts</a>, to honor 11-year-old Willie Luce, who had died at his father's side as the ship sank. James Brown of Brown Brothers bank built an elaborate monument in <a href="Green-Wood%20Cemetery">Green-Wood Cemetery</a>, <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, to commemorate the six members of his family who had drowned. It incorporates a sculpture of "Arctic" at the moment of her sinking. An anonymous poetic tribute was printed in the "New York Herald" of October 22, 1854. It includes the words: 
<poem>
Another and the steamer sinks. Their doom
Is registered. Accusing woman driven
To death by coward man, was heard by Him
Who holds the scales of Justice. Mighty God!</poem>
It ends with the warning: "Vengeance, saith the Lord, is mine".

Karl Knaths

Karl Knaths (October 21, 1891 – March 9, 1971) was an American artist whose personal approach to the <a href="Cubism">Cubist aesthetic</a> led him to create paintings which, while <a href="Abstract%20art">abstract</a>, contained readily identifiable subjects. In addition to the Cubist painters, his work shows influence by <a href="Paul%20C%C3%A9zanne">Paul Cézanne</a>, <a href="Wassily%20Kandinsky">Wassily Kandinsky</a>, <a href="Kuniyoshi">Utagawa Kuniyoshi</a>, <a href="Paul%20Klee">Paul Klee</a>, <a href="Stuart%20Davis%20%28painter%29">Stuart Davis</a>, and <a href="Agnes%20Weinrich">Agnes Weinrich</a>. It is nonetheless, in use of heavy line, rendering of depth, disciplined treatment of color, and architecture of planes, distinctly his own.

Karl Knaths was born October 21, 1891, in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. His parents were Otto Julius Knaths and Maria Theresa Knaths. Shortly after Knaths's birth the family moved to <a href="Portage%2C%20Wisconsin">Portage, Wisconsin</a> where he spent his childhood years. When he was in his late teens his father died and he became apprenticed to his mother's brother, George Dietrich, in the baking trade. Although he had begun making sketches, he had no art instruction and little time for self-instruction. While attending Portage High School he met the local author, <a href="Zona%20Gale">Zona Gale</a>. She encouraged his interest and, upon his graduation in 1910, both convinced his uncle to release him from apprenticeship and introduced him to <a href="http%3A//blog.mam.org/2011/11/22/connecting-orson-welles-to-the-milwaukee-art-institute/">Dudley Crafts Watson</a> of the Milwaukee Art Institute. During the next year he studied art at the Institute. He obtained the job by which he supported himself when Gale introduced him to Laura Sherry, the director of the Wisconsin Players. Despite his youth and inexperience, Sherry took him on as caretaker of the playhouse and one of its set designers. In 1911, on advice from Gale and Craft, Knaths began studies at the <a href="School%20of%20the%20Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago">School of the Art Institute of Chicago</a>. There, he mainly supported himself as janitor's assistant but when the <a href="Armory%20show">1913 Armory Show</a> came to town he landed a job at the show as one of the guards. The show was his first substantial exposure to <a href="Modernism">European modernism</a> and he later reported that the experience both confused and awed him. Uncomfortable with most of the work on display, he found much to like in the works of Cézanne, particularly the blocks of muted color out of which he built his compositions.

In 1917 Knaths rejoined the Wisconsin Players as the group's scenery painter during a tour of East Coast theaters. When the Players arrived in <a href="Provincetown%2C%20Massachusetts">Provincetown, Massachusetts</a> for a performance of Gale's "Mr. Pitt" Knaths recognized it as a place where he could successfully practice his vocation. After two years' military service Knaths spent a short time studying art in New York City and then, in 1919, moved to Provincetown, which became his principal residence for the rest of his life. In the early twentieth century Provincetown was a prosperous fishing town which attracted artists and theater people from New York's <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a> as summer residents. On or soon after his arrival he met two sisters, Helen and <a href="Agnes%20Weinrich">Agnes Weinrich</a> of the <a href="Provincetown%20Printers">Provincetown Printers</a>. The sisters had grown up on a prosperous Iowa farm, daughters of German immigrant parents. When in their 20s they had accompanied their father on a trip to Germany where Helen studied music and Agnes painting. Their father dying, they received an inheritance which permitted them to live and travel on their own and they returned to Germany and France to study further. In 1914 the sisters began spending the warm months of the year in Provincetown and, through contact with European expatriates who settled there during World War I, Agnes learned to employ <a href="Modernism">Modernist</a> and particularly <a href="Cubism">Cubist</a> techniques in her work. After their first meeting Agnes helped Knaths to develop his personal style of painting and over time they developed a close and mutually beneficial working relationship. In 1922 Knaths married Helen and moved into the house which the sisters had rented. He was then 30, Helen 45, and Agnes 46. Agnes remained a member of the Knaths's household the rest of her life.

Knaths's earliest work has the strong lines, blocks of muted colors, and juxtaposition of rectangular and curvilinear forms which characterize his mature style. One of his early paintings, "Horse Barns", Provincetown (1919, gouache, 7x8") contains three barn structures within a small grove of trees and bushes. It shows influence of Cézanne and is not notably Cubist. The coloration is low-key in green, purple, and ochre hues. The composition has sweeping rounded shapes beside heavily outlined rhombuses and other quadrilateral shapes. It has a painterly, nearly impressionist feel and, despite the subject matter, might as well be a still life as a landscape.

Knaths's mature style emerged in the early 1930s. It evolved, he said, as he "learned to move slowly from color relations, to line sequence, to better spacing, proportions, to a thematic play of shapes." During the 1920s he had studied, and sometimes translated from German, theoretical publications of theorists and artists, including <a href="Carl%20Einstein">Carl Einstein</a>, <a href="Wilhelm%20Ostwald">Wilhelm Ostwald</a>, <a href="Piet%20Mondrian">Piet Mondrian</a>, <a href="Wassily%20Kandinsky">Wassily Kandinsky</a>, and <a href="Jay%20Hambidge">Jay Hambidge</a>. He later reported that he was particularly impressed by ideas presented by <a href="Gino%20Severini">Gino Severini</a> in "Du cubisme au classicisme; esthétique du compas et du nombre" (Paris, J. Povolozky & Cie, 1921). While these books deal mainly with color, proportion, and <a href="Bauhaus">Bauhaus</a> design theory, Knaths was also interested in the relationship between music and painting and in this it is likely his wife, Helen, who was a conservatory-trained musician and whose piano playing he enjoyed almost daily, was an influence.

Knaths's interests in theories of color, proportion, and music bore fruit in a system that, while it was mathematically influenced and employed a formal method of color selection, retained the lyricism which marks most of his work. The methodology he followed rather enhanced than inhibited his freedom of expression. In his case, as with many poets and musicians, a voluntary submission to rules of form and design seems to have helped rather than hindered him in achieving his goals. An art historian summarized this lyricism, writing that Knaths's approach to Cubism was romantic rather than academic or literal. Another wrote that Knaths's paintings are personal expressions of both theory and feeling which arise from his love of nature, his close bond with his community, and a "poetic meditation on human life." A third simply calls Knaths a poet of painting. Knaths himself wrote on this subject: "Systems are only bricks and lumber — of themselves they cannot encompass the immeasurable spiritual qualities that go into a successful picture. The unlooked-for things that happen in the process of work are the important ones." A detailed description of Knaths's application of theory to his practice of art is given in "Four American Expressionists: Doris Caesar, Chaim Gross, Karl Knaths, Abraham Rattner", pp. 16–17 (New York, Whitney Museum of American Art, 1959) and also in "Karl Knaths To Teach at Art Gallery," Alice Graeme, "The Washington Post", February 20, 1938, p. TT5.
A painting from Knaths's mature period, "Pumpkin", shows his integration of the abstract Cubist idiom with a representational tabletop still life. Strong calligraphic lines demarcate planes of both bright and muted colors and the composition can be viewed as both two- and three-dimensional: either blocks of color juxtaposed in rectangular and curvilinear shapes or a foreground still-life grouping — a table holding bottle, glass, pieces of fruit, and pumpkin — within an abstract enclosed space with what appear to be windows or panels on a rear wall. The background at left bears similarity to a wall in the artist's studio shown in a photo of 1961 and this suggests that the windows or panels at right might be paintings.

Once he had established his mature style Knaths allowed himself freedom to range widely from its core elements. This is most obvious during his mid-1930s employment as artist in the <a href="Works%20Progress%20Administration">WPA</a> <a href="Federal%20Art%20Project">Federal Art Project</a> and the <a href="Section%20of%20Painting%20and%20Sculpture">Section of Painting and Sculpture</a>. His <a href="United%20States%20post%20office%20murals">post office murals</a> have the same <a href="Social%20realism">social realist</a> style as most of the others produced by New Deal artists. See for example his "Frontier Mail" in the post office at Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. It can also be seen, for example, in a <a href="http%3A//www.wikiart.org/en/karl-knaths/composition-1936">painting of 1936 called "Composition"</a> showing two men seated at a table with a coffee pot and mugs, a woman standing with broom in hand, and a cat lying on the floor of a sparsely-furnished room. Although having a Cubist surface quality, it could not be said to be an abstract painting. "Frontier Mail" and "Composition" contrast strongly with a painting he made before either of them: "Maritime", a composition whose subjects are much more symbolically nautical than recognizably displayed.

In the early years of his marriage, Knaths, Helen, and Agnes lived on the sisters' legacy and what little money Knaths brought in through odd jobs and the occasional sale of a painting. The winter months were cold and their house so drafty that, even though Knaths disliked city life, they spent much of that season in New York. In 1924 Helen and Agnes bought land on which Knaths constructed a house and studio using materials from nearby derelict buildings. He recognized that he needed to establish connections with dealers and exhibitors if he wished to find buyers for his art and, together with Agnes, he used his time in New York as well as trips to Boston and Washington, D.C. to do just that. In 1921 he exhibited paintings at New York's <a href="Society%20of%20Independent%20Artists">Society of Independent Artists</a> for the first of many occasions. Knaths showed two and Agnes Weinrich three paintings in this large non-juried show without prizes. In 1926 Knaths's work appeared in another show, the <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20Anonyme">Société Anonyme</a> exhibition, held in Brooklyn, and, that same year, the collector, <a href="Duncan%20Phillips%20%28art%20collector%29">Duncan Phillips</a> bought his "Geranium in Night Window" of 1922. Of the purchase Phillips, who was not an impulsive buyer, noted: "This exceptionally promising canvas reveals a delightful sense of color relations and a developed knowledge of what happens to colors under a flickering play of light." This proved to be the first of many purchases by Phillips and the beginning of a long and mutually rewarding friendship between the two men. During the next few years Phillips would write appreciative articles about Knaths's work and, in 1929, would devote a room in his Washington, D.C. gallery to their display. On opening the room he gave Knaths his first one-person show. A year later Knaths was given a second solo exhibition, this one at the gallery of Charles Daniel in New York.

That year Daniel became Knaths's first art dealer. In 1931 Knaths left Daniel for the Downtown Gallery and soon after he moved, this time to the J.B. Neumann Gallery. In 1945 he moved to the gallery of Paul Rosenberg & Co.,

He was a gifted instructor but taught for brief periods at a time. Between 1938 and 1950 he gave lectures during the winter session of the Phillips Gallery Art School. From 1943 to 1945 he taught art courses at <a href="Bennington%20College">Bennington College</a>. He also he lectured at <a href="Black%20Mountain%20College">Black Mountain College</a> in 1944 at the <a href="Skowhegan%20School%20of%20Painting%20and%20Sculpture">Skowhegan School of Painting</a> in 1948. Among his pupils was <a href="Dorothy%20Fratt">Dorothy Fratt</a>.

Throughout his career Knaths drew inspiration from the natural environment in which he lived. The images he made of his everyday world include many still lifes and room interiors as well as outdoor paintings of local fishermen and clam diggers, wild and domesticated animals, and Cape Cod marine life. His choice of subjects was generally consistent while his treatment of them varied in degree of abstraction.

While young he was one of a relatively small number of American painters whose work was termed "modernist" and, as he matured, he grew to be one of the best known among them. By the early 1930s critics had begun to take note of Knaths and give his work more than a passing mention. In 1931 the critic for the "New York Sun" could say that his work had been known in the art world for quite a few years and was fairly widely collected. While abstract, his paintings possessed, this critic wrote, "a very individual kind of realism." "One feels in his work," he went on, "a love for the medium, rich textural quality, and a very unusual color harmony which varies with the subject." By the late 1940s appreciative notices such as this one became reasonably common. Beginning about 1944 newspaper art critics more frequently would analyze and usually praise his work rather than simply listing it as appearing in a show. For example, in that year A. Z. Kruse wrote a piece about his work in the "Brooklyn Daily Eagle" and in the late 1940s his work was featured in articles in "Art News" and the "New York Times". In 1949 he was featured in an article by Elaine de Kooning, "Knaths Paints a Picture," in "Art News".

Knaths's inaugural show in 1947 at the Paul Rosenberg Gallery was seen by one critic to be one of the ten best exhibitions of the year. In 1950 his painting "Basket Bouquet" won first prize in the Metropolitan Museum "American Painting Today" competition. This prize cemented his reputation as one of America's leading modernists and also marked the beginning of what would become a gradual falling off of interest in his work.

The "American Painting Today" competition touched off a rebellion by the new generation of New York painters. Calling themselves <a href="The%20Irascibles">The Irascibles</a>, a group of <a href="Abstract%20expressionism">abstract expressionists</a> wrote a protest complaining that the jury was hostile to the "advanced art" which they produced. The signatories were the most prominent members of what would come to be called the <a href="New%20York%20School%20%28art%29">New York School</a>, men such as <a href="Adolph%20Gottlieb">Adolph Gottlieb</a>, <a href="Robert%20Motherwell">Robert Motherwell</a>, <a href="Clyfford%20Still">Clyfford Still</a>, <a href="Ad%20Reinhardt">Ad Reinhardt</a>, <a href="Jackson%20Pollock">Jackson Pollock</a>, and <a href="Willem%20de%20Kooning">Willem de Kooning</a>. The protest of the young painters can be seen in retrospect as a turning point in Knaths's career. During the 1950s, as abstract expressionism gained favor, his work gradually lost popularity. The transition cannot have been unexpected but there was an irony in the fact that when he was a young painter Knaths too rebelled against what he saw as the biases of traditionalist juries. In time, when compared to the abstract expressionists, he began to seem conservative, a pathfinder rather than an innovator. One critic said Knaths did not then aim to break new ground but rather to "define the guiding limits within which modern painting must proceed in order to reach it."

This is not to say that he stopped working. He continued to work, to show, to sell, and to accrue honors. If he cared at all about his possible displacement by the new movement in the New York art world, he did not show it. In an interview he gave at the time he received the award he made no complaint about the protest but only suggested that the artists might have submitted their work to the jury and protested only if it were not accepted. In another interview, given two years later, he said, mildly, that too many artists "aren't willing to work for the final harmony of relationships." He believed they worked too quickly and lacked a habit of critical reflection. On their part the abstract expressionists seem not to have stereotyped Knaths's work as staid and conservative. <a href="Barnett%20Newman">Barnett Newman</a>, one of the men who signed the 1950 protest letter, felt that it was like the work of Adolph Gottlieb and Mark Rothko in having an intensity of feeling and emotional impact. Of the three he wrote "These artists are doing what seems impossible, expressing feelings and thoughts with abstract forms and flat space." There remained an excellent market for Knaths's paintings during the remainder of his life and, at his death, the works left in his estate commanded relatively high prices.

Knaths died on March 9, 1971, in Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Massachusetts, after a brief illness. Before entering the hospital he was still living in the house he had built in Provincetown and his widow, Helen, continued to live there the remainder of her life.

Knaths's father, Otto Julius, was born on October 10, 1846, in Wettin, Germany. An orphan, he attended the Latin School in Halle and emigrated to the United States from Leipzig in 1869. He earned his living as a baker. He married a woman whose name is given as Maria Theresa Dietrich or Tressie Tredeck. Her birth date is not known. She died in 1932. She came from Wisconsin, and, at about the time they were married, she and Otto Julius moved to that state from Cincinnati, Ohio. The couple lived in Eau Claire, where, in 1891, Knaths was born. Soon after, they moved to Portage, Wisconsin, where, at about age 14, young Knaths began working for his uncle, George F. Dietrich, also a baker. Otto Julius died in 1908. Aged 17 at that time, Knaths was living with his uncle as well as apprenticed to him. Knaths had a sister, Olga, who was born December 9, 1893, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and who died January 18, 1981, in Madison, Wisconsin. She married a man named Frank Dunn and they had a son, Francis.

Knaths and his wife Helen had no children. Helen's birth name was Lena. She changed it to Helen after 1905 when she and Agnes returned from travels in Europe. She was born in 1876 on a farm in Des Moines County in south east Iowa and died at age 102 in 1978 while living in Provincetown.

From the time of Knaths's marriage to Helen and their decision to live together with her sister Agnes, the three formed a bond that survived during the rest of their lives. Agnes was born in 1873 on the same farm as her sister. Agnes was gregarious while Helen was quiet and apparently frail. It was Agnes who managed household for them while Helen stayed largely in the background. Knaths took over this role when Agnes died in 1946. When Knaths died in 1971, Helen showed a vivacious personality that she had previously kept hidden.

Knaths was raised in households where German was commonly spoken and himself spoke with a slight German accent. A voracious reader, he liked to translate German writings on theories of music, colors, and painting and would ask friends to help him make the English plain.

Photos of Knaths show him to have been a large man, tall and broad. When in 1910 he went to Milwaukee to study, he was, according to one description, "an angular, open-faced boy." His World War I registration card says he had dark hair and blue eyes. People who knew him wrote that he was tall and fit, strong and gentle. Balding in middle life, he wore a beret most of the time. In an interview when he was 62 a reporter described him as "apple cheeked" and another wrote that at age 72 he was "an impressively tall, broad, sturdy man ... with a smooth ruddy face and a steady smile." He was industrious and regular in his work habits. Described as shy, sensitive, and somewhat retiring, he was also said to be modest and charming — a man whose bearing conveyed gravity and whose approach to life and art was passionate. He read philosophy and classical literature as well as writings on art, music, and color theory and he loved to listen to classical music, particularly the works his wife would play on the piano.

Knaths's surname is pronounced with a hard K. Throughout his career as a professional artist Knaths was known as Karl Knaths. His probable birth name was Otto Karl Knaths. He gave that name while attending high school and when completing his World War II draft registration. The name Otto K. Knaths appears in records for the 1930 and 1940 Census of the United States. The records of the Massachusetts census of 1905 and the U.S. census of 1910, as well as a news article of 1917 give his name as Otto Knaths. Two other names appear in official records. He gave his name as Otto George Knaths when registering for military service in the First World War. and the Massachusetts Death Index lists him as Karl O. Knaths. Since Otto by itself, Otto K., and Otto Karl appear most frequently on official records and since his father's given name was Otto, it is likely Otto Karl Knaths was his birth name. He was still part of the household of his uncle George Dietrich when he used the name Otto George, which might account for that outlying usage.

Blue men of the Minch

The blue men of the Minch, also known as storm kelpies ( ), are <a href="mythological%20creature">mythological creature</a>s inhabiting the stretch of water between the northern <a href="Outer%20Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a> and mainland Scotland, looking for sailors to drown and stricken boats to sink. They appear to be localised to <a href="the%20Minch">the Minch</a> and surrounding areas, unknown in other parts of Scotland and without counterparts in the rest of the world.

Apart from their blue colour, the mythical creatures look much like humans, and are about the same size. They have the power to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float sleeping on or just below the surface of the water. The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as <a href="porpoise">porpoise</a>s do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.

Suggestions to explain the mythical blue men include that they may be a personification of the sea, or originate with the <a href="Picts">Picts</a>, whose painted bodies may have given the impression of men raising themselves out of the water if they were seen crossing the sea in boats that might have resembled <a href="kayak">kayak</a>s. The genesis of the blue men may alternatively lie with the North African slaves the <a href="Viking">Viking</a>s took with them to Scotland, where they spent the winter months close to the <a href="Shiant%20Isles">Shiant Isles</a> in the Minch.

<a href="The%20Minch">The Minch</a>, a <a href="strait">strait</a> that separates the northwest <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Highlands</a> of Scotland and the northern <a href="Inner%20Hebrides">Inner Hebrides</a> from the northern <a href="Outer%20Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a>, is home to the blue men. The <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Scottish Gaelic</a> terms for the blue men is "na fir ghorma" (in the <a href="genitive%20case">genitive</a> "fear gorm", for example "sruth nam fear gorm" "the stream of the blue men").

The blue men are also styled as storm kelpies. The most common water spirits in Scottish folklore, <a href="kelpies">kelpies</a> are usually described as powerful horses, but the name is attributed to several different forms and fables throughout the country. The name "kelpie" may be derived from the <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Scottish Gaelic</a> "calpa" or "cailpeach", meaning "heifer" or "colt".

The mythical blue men may have been part of a tribe of "fallen angels" that split into three; the first became the ground dwelling fairies, the second evolved to become the sea inhabiting blue men, and the remainder the "Merry Dancers" of the <a href="Aurora">Northern Lights</a> in the sky. The legendary creatures are the same size as humans but, as the name implies, blue in colour. Writer and journalist <a href="Lewis%20Spence">Lewis Spence</a> thought they were the "personifications of the sea itself" as they took their blue colouration from the hue of the sea. Their faces are grey and long in shape and some have long arms, which are also grey, and they favour blue headgear; at least one account claims that they also have wings. The tempestuous water around the <a href="Shiant%20Isles">Shiant Isles</a> to the north of <a href="Skye">Skye</a>, an area subject to rapid tides in all weathers, flows beside the caves inhabited by the blue men, a stretch of water known as the Current of Destruction owing to the number of ships wrecked there.

Although other storm kelpies are reported as inhabiting the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Corryvreckan">Gulf of Corrievreckan</a>, described by poet, writer and folklorist <a href="Alasdair%20Alpin%20MacGregor">Alasdair Alpin MacGregor</a> as "the fiercest of the Highland storm kelpies", the blue men are confined to a very restricted area. According to <a href="Donald%20Alexander%20Mackenzie">Donald A. Mackenzie</a> they have no counterparts elsewhere in the world or even in other areas of Scotland; such limited range is rare for beliefs in spirits and demons. Folklorist and <a href="Tiree">Tiree</a> minister <a href="John%20Gregorson%20Campbell">John Gregorson Campbell</a> states that they were unknown in <a href="Argyll">Argyll</a> on the nearby coast of the mainland for instance, although <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> minister <a href="John%20Brand%20%28minister%29">John Brand</a>, who visited <a href="Quarff">Quarff</a> in Shetland in mid-1700, recounts a tale of what may have been a blue man in the waters around the island. In the form of a bearded old man it rose out of the water, terrifying the passengers and crew of a boat it was following.

In traditional tales the blue men have the power to create severe storms, but when the weather is fine they sleep or float just under the surface of the water. They swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea, twisting and diving in a similar way to a <a href="porpoise">porpoise</a>. To amuse themselves the creatures play <a href="shinty">shinty</a> when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with laughter as vessels capsize.

When the blue men gather to attack passing vessels their chief, sometimes named as <a href="Seonaidh">Shony</a>, rises up out of the water and shouts two lines of poetry to the skipper, and if he cannot add two lines to complete the verse the blue men seize his boat. Mackenzie highlights the following exchange between the skipper of a boat and the chief of the blue men:

The quick responses took the blue chief by surprise; defeated and unable to do any damage to the vessel, the blue men returned to their underwater caves, allowing the vessel free passage through the strait. The blue men may alternatively board a passing vessel and demand tribute from its crew, threatening that if it is not forthcoming they will raise up a storm.

No surviving tales mention attempts to kill the demons, but a Gregorson Campbell story tells of the capture of a blue man. Sailors seize a blue man and tie him up on board their ship after he is discovered "sleeping on the waters". Two fellow blue men give chase, calling out to each other as they swim towards the ship:

On hearing his companions' voices the captured spirit breaks free of his bonds and jumps overboard as he answers:

Sailors thus believed that all blue men have names by which they address each other.

Mackenzie's explanation of the legend of the blue men was based partly on research into the Annals of Ireland and goes back to the times of <a href="Harald%20Fairhair">Harald Fairhair</a>, the first Norse king, and his battles against the <a href="Vikings">Vikings</a>. The Scottish Gaelic term "fir ghorma", meaning "blue men", is the descriptor for a black man according to Dwelly. Thus "sruth nam fear gorm", one of the blue men's Gaelic names, literally translates as "stream of the blue men", or "river, tide or stream of the black man". Around the 9th century the Vikings took <a href="Moor%20%28people%29">Moors</a> they had captured and were using as slaves to Ireland. The Vikings spent winter months near the Shiant Isles, and Mackenzie attributes the story of the blue men to "marooned foreign slaves". He quotes an excerpt from historian <a href="Alan%20Orr%20Anderson">Alan Orr Anderson</a>'s "Early sources of Scottish history, A.D. 500 to 1286":

More recent newspaper reports have repeated Mackenzie's hypothesis. Historian Malcolm Archibald agrees the legend originates from the days Norsemen had North African slaves, but speculates that the myth may have originated with the <a href="Tuareg%20people">Tuareg people</a> of <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a>n Africa, who were known as the "blue men of the desert".

The origin of the blue men of the Minch may alternatively lie with "tattooing people" specifically the Picts, whose <a href="Latin">Latin</a> name "picti" means "painted people". If they were seen crossing the water in boats resembling the <a href="kayak">kayak</a>s of the <a href="Finn-men">Finn-men</a> they may have given simple islanders and mariners the impression of the upper part of the body rising out of the water.

The Founding Ceremony of the Nation

The Founding Ceremony of the Nation (or The Founding of the Nation, ) is a 1953 <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> by Chinese artist <a href="Dong%20Xiwen">Dong Xiwen</a>. It depicts <a href="Mao%20Zedong">Mao Zedong</a> and other <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20China">Communist</a> officials inaugurating the <a href="China">People's Republic of China</a> at <a href="Tiananmen%20Square">Tiananmen Square</a> on October 1, 1949. A prominent example of <a href="socialist%20realism">socialist realism</a>, it is one of the most celebrated works of official Chinese art. The painting was repeatedly revised, and a replica painting made to accommodate further changes, as the leaders it depicted fell from power and later were <a href="Political%20rehabilitation%23China">rehabilitated</a>.

After the Communists <a href="Chinese%20Communist%20Revolution">took control</a> of China, they sought to memorialize their achievements through artworks. Dong was commissioned to create a visual representation of the October 1 ceremony, which he had attended. He viewed it as essential that the painting show both the people and their leaders. After working for three months, he completed an oil painting in a <a href="folk%20art">folk art</a> style, drawing upon Chinese art history for the contemporary subject. The success of the painting was assured when Mao viewed it and liked it, and it was reproduced in large numbers for display in the home.

The 1954 <a href="purge">purge</a> of <a href="Gao%20Gang">Gao Gang</a> from the government resulted in Dong being ordered to remove him from the painting. Gao's departure was not the last; Dong was forced to remove <a href="Liu%20Shaoqi">Liu Shaoqi</a> in 1967. The winds of political fortune continued to shift during the <a href="Cultural%20Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a>, and a reproduction was painted by other artists in 1972 to accommodate another deletion. That replica was modified in 1979 to include the purged individuals, who had been rehabilitated. Both canvases are in the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20China">National Museum of China</a> in Beijing.

Following the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, Communists quickly took control of <a href="Chinese%20art%23Communist%20and%20socialist%20art%20%281950%E2%80%931980s%29">art in China</a>. The <a href="socialist%20realism">socialist realism</a> that was characteristic of <a href="Soviet%20art">Soviet art</a> came to be highly influential in the People's Republic. The new government proposed a series of paintings, preferably in oil, to memorialize the history of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20China">Communist Party of China</a> (CPC), and its triumph in 1949. To this end, in December 1950, arts official Wang Yeqiu proposed to Deputy Minister of Culture <a href="Zhou%20Yang%20%28literary%20theorist%29">Zhou Yang</a> that there be an art exhibition the following year to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Party in China. Wang had toured the Soviet Union and observed its art, with which he was greatly impressed, and he proposed that sculptures and paintings be exhibited depicting the CPC's history, for eventual inclusion in the planned Museum of the Chinese Revolution. Even before gaining full control of the country, the CPC had used art as <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a>, a technique especially effective as much of the Chinese population was then illiterate. Wang's proposal was preliminarily approved in March 1951, and a committee, including the art critic and official <a href="Jiang%20Feng%20%28artist%29">Jiang Feng</a>, was appointed to seek suitable artists. Although nearly 100 paintings were produced for the 1951 exhibition, not enough were found to be suitable, and it was cancelled.
The use of oil paintings to memorialize events and make a political statement was not new; 19th-century examples include <a href="John%20Trumbull">John Trumbull</a>'s paintings for the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol%23Art">United States Capitol</a> (1817–1821) and <a href="Jacques-Louis%20David">Jacques-Louis David</a>'s "<a href="The%20Coronation%20of%20Napoleon">The Coronation of Napoleon</a>" (1807). Oil painting allowed for a blending of tones to produce a wide range of realistic, attractive colors, in a way not possible with traditional Chinese ink and brush painting. Wang admired how, in Moscow museums, <a href="Lenin">Lenin</a>'s career was chronicled and made accessible to the masses through artifacts accompanied by oil paintings showing crucial moments in the Communist leader's career. He and higher-level officials decided to use a similar technique as they planned the Museum of the Chinese Revolution. Thus, they sought to chronicle the Party's history and showcase its accomplishments. Paintings were commissioned, even though the museum did not yet exist and would not open until 1961. Chinese leaders were eager to be presented in paintings, wanting to be immortalized as central characters in the nation's historical drama.

None of the works initially obtained for the museum depicted the crowning moment of the revolution, the ceremony at <a href="Tiananmen%20Square">Tiananmen Square</a> on October 1, 1949, when <a href="Mao%20Zedong">Mao Zedong</a> proclaimed the People's Republic. Officials deemed such a work essential. <a href="Dong%20Xiwen">Dong Xiwen</a>, a professor at the <a href="China%20Central%20Academy%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Central Academy of Fine Arts</a> (CAFA) in Beijing, was accomplished and politically reliable, and had been present at the October 1 ceremony: he was an obvious candidate. Although Dong later complained that never in his career had he had full freedom of choice as to his paintings' subjects, "The Founding of the Nation" would make him famous.

The painting depicts the inaugural ceremony of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949. The focus is on Mao, who stands on <a href="Tiananmen%20Gate">Tiananmen Gate</a>'s balcony, reading his proclamation into (originally) two microphones. Dong took some liberties with the appearance of Tiananmen Gate, opening up the space in front of Mao to grant the chairman a more direct connection with his people, something that architect <a href="Liang%20Sicheng">Liang Sicheng</a> deemed a mistake for a builder, but artistically brilliant. Five <a href="Doves%20as%20symbols">doves</a> fly into the sky to Mao's right. Before him on Tiananmen Square, honor guards and members of patriotic organizations are assembled in orderly ranks, with some holding banners. <a href="Qianmen">Qianmen</a>, the gate at the south end of the square, is visible, as is <a href="Yongdingmen">Yongdingmen</a> gate (seen to the left of Mao). Beyond the old city walls that at the time enclosed the square (they were torn down in the 1950s), the city of Beijing is visible, and in green is represented the nation of China, with those further scenes under bright sunlight and sharply defined clouds. October 1 had been an overcast day in Beijing; Dong took artistic license with the weather.

To Mao's left are seen his lieutenants in the Communist takeover. In the original painting, the front row, which is ordered by rank, consisted of (from left) General <a href="Zhu%20De">Zhu De</a>, <a href="Liu%20Shaoqi">Liu Shaoqi</a>, Madame <a href="Song%20Qingling">Song Qingling</a> (the widow of <a href="Sun%20Zhongshan">Sun Zhongshan</a>), <a href="Li%20Jishen">Li Jishen</a>, <a href="Zhang%20Lan">Zhang Lan</a> (with beard), and at far right, General <a href="Gao%20Gang">Gao Gang</a>. <a href="Zhou%20Enlai">Zhou Enlai</a> was furthest left in the second row, and beside him were <a href="Dong%20Biwu">Dong Biwu</a>, two men whose identities are uncertain, and furthest right, <a href="Guo%20Moruo">Guo Moruo</a>. <a href="Lin%20Boqu">Lin Boqu</a> was furthest left in the third row. The leaders congregate close to each other, while remaining a respectful distance from Mao. This emphasizes his primacy, as does the fact that he is depicted as taller than his lieutenants. The point of view of the observer is well back on the balcony, from which most of the square would be obscured by the floor. Rather than show only Mao and sky, Dong manipulated the <a href="Perspective%20%28graphical%29">perspective</a>, raising the horizon and intensifying the foreshortening of the balcony. Necessarily, only the officials and not the crowd below are represented as individuals; art historian Wu Hung wrote that "the parading masses in the Square derive strength from a collective anonymity. The combination of the two—above and below, the leaders and the people—constitutes a comprehensive representation of New China."

Mao and his officials are surrounded by <a href="Paper%20lantern">lanterns</a>, symbols of prosperity; the <a href="chrysanthemum">chrysanthemum</a>s on either side symbolize longevity. The doves represent peace restored to a nation long wracked by war. The new five-star <a href="flag%20of%20China">flag of China</a>, rising over the people, represents the end of the <a href="Fengjian">feudal system</a> and the rebirth of the nation as the People's Republic. Mao, who is presented as a statesman, not as the revolutionary leader he was during the conflict, faces Qianmen, aligning himself along Beijing's old imperial North-South Axis, symbolizing his authority. The chairman is at the center of multiple, concentric circles in the painting, with the innermost formed by the front row of his comrades, another by the people in the square, and the outermost the old city walls. Surrounding them are the sunlit scenes, envisioning a glorious future for China with Mao the heart of the nation.
Although Dong had been trained in <a href="Western%20painting">Western painting</a>, he chose a <a href="folk%20art">folk art</a> style for "The Founding of the Nation", using bright, contrasting colors in a manner similar to that in <a href="Chinese%20New%20Year">New Year</a>'s prints popular in China. He stated in 1953, "the Chinese people like bright, intense colors. This convention is in line with the theme of "The Founding Ceremony of the Nation". In my choice of colors I did not hesitate to put aside the complex colors commonly adopted in Western painting as well as the conventional rules for oil painting." Artists in the early years of the People's Republic, including Dong, sought to satisfy Chinese aesthetic tastes in their works and so depicted their subjects in bright original color, avoiding complex use of light and shadow on faces as in many Western paintings. By European standards, the painting's colors are overly intense and saturated. The color <a href="vermilion">vermilion</a> was used for large areas of the columns, the carpets, and the lanterns, setting a tone for the work. The blooming flowers, the flags and banners, and the blue and white sky all give the painting a happy atmosphere—a joyful, festive air, as well as giving "cultural sublimity", appropriate for a work depicting the founding of a nation.

Dong drew upon Chinese art history, using techniques from <a href="Mogao%20Caves">Dunhuang murals</a> of the <a href="Tang%20Dynasty">Tang Dynasty</a>, <a href="Ming%20Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a> portraits, and ancient figure paintings. Patterns on the carpet, columns, lanterns, and railing evoke cultural symbols. The colors of the painting are reminiscent of crudely printed rural <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a>s; this is emphasized by the black outlines of a number of objects, including the pillars and stone railing, as those outlines are characteristic of such woodcuts. Dong noted, "If this painting is rich in national styles, it is largely because I adopted these [native] approaches."

"The Founding of the Nation" was one of several paintings commissioned for the new Museum of the Chinese Revolution from faculty members at CAFA. Two of these, Luo Gongliu's "Tunnel Warfare" and Wang Shikuo's "Sending Him Off to the Army", were completed in 1951; "The Founding of the Nation" was finished the following year. These commissions were regarded as from the government and were highly prestigious. State assistance, such as access to archives, was available.

At the time CAFA chose Dong, he was painting workers at the <a href="Shijingshan%20District">Shijingshan</a> power plant outside Beijing. Dong reviewed the photographs of the event, but found them unsatisfactory as none showed both the leaders and the people gathered in the square below, which he felt was necessary. He created a postcard-size sketch, but was dissatisfied with it, feeling it did not capture the grandeur of the occasion. Taking advice from other artists, Dong made adjustments to his plan.

Dong rented a small room in western Beijing above a store selling <a href="soy%20sauce">soy sauce</a>. Jiang intervened to give Dong time and space to create the painting; the artist needed three months to complete his work. The room was smaller than the painting, which is four meters wide, and Dong would affix part of the canvas to the ceiling, working on his back. To save commuting time, he slept in a chair. He smoked cigarettes constantly as he worked. His daughter brought meals, but he was often unable to eat. Once the painting was under way, several of Dong's colleagues, including oil painter , came to visit. They decided that the figure of Mao, the central one of the painting, was not tall enough. Dong removed the figure of Mao from the canvas, and painted him again, increasing his height by just under an inch (2.54 cm).

In painting the sky and the pillars, Dong used a pen and brush, as if doing a traditional Chinese painting. He depicted the clothing in detail; Madame Song wears gloves showing flowers, while Zhang Lan's silk robe appears carefully ironed for the momentous day. Dong used <a href="sawdust">sawdust</a> to enhance the texture of the carpet on which Mao stands; he painted the marble railing as yellowish rather than white, thus emphasizing the age of the Chinese nation. The leaders in the painting were asked to examine their portraits for accuracy.

When the painting was unveiled in 1953, most Chinese critics were enthusiastic. <a href="Xu%20Beihong">Xu Beihong</a>, the president of CAFA and a pioneer in using realism in oil painting, admired the manner in which the work fulfilled its political mission, but complained that because of the colors, it barely resembled an oil painting. He and others, though, saw that the painting opened a new chapter in Chinese art development. Zhu Dan, head of the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, which would reproduce the painting for the masses, argued that it was more a poster than an oil painting. Other artists stated that Dong's earlier works, such as "Kazakh Shepherdess" (1947) and "Liberation" (1949), were better examples of the new national style of art. Senior Party leaders, though, approved of the painting, as art historian Chang-Tai Hung put it, "seeing it as a testament to the young nation's evolving identity and growing confidence".

Soon after the unveiling, Jiang wanted to arrange an exhibition at which government officials, including Mao, could view and publicly endorse the new Chinese art. He had connections in Mao's inner circle, and Dong and others organized it to be in conjunction with meetings at <a href="Zhongnanhai">Zhongnanhai</a> that Mao led. This was, most likely, the only time Mao attended an art exhibition after 1949. Mao visited the exhibition three times in between meetings and especially liked "The Founding of the Nation"—the official photograph of the event shows Mao and <a href="Zhou%20Enlai">Zhou Enlai</a> viewing the canvas with Dong. The chairman stared at the painting for a long time and finally said, "It is a great nation. It really is a great nation." Mao also stated that the portrayal of <a href="Dong%20Biwu">Dong Biwu</a> was particularly well rendered. As Dong Biwu was in the second row, mostly hidden by the large <a href="Zhu%20De">Zhu De</a>, Mao was most likely joking, but the favorable reaction by the country's leader assured the success of the painting.

"The Founding of the Nation" was hailed as one of the greatest oil paintings ever by a Chinese artist by reviewers in that country, and more than 500,000 reproductions were sold in three months. Mao's praise helped boost the painting and its painter. Dong's techniques were seen as bridging the gap between the elitist medium of oil painting and popular art, and as a boost to Jiang's position that realistic art could be politically desirable. It was reproduced in primary and secondary school textbooks. The painting appeared on the front page of "<a href="People%27s%20Daily">People's Daily</a>" in September 1953, and became an officially approved interior decoration. One English-language magazine published by the Chinese government for distribution abroad showed a model family in a modern apartment, with a large poster of "The Founding of the Nation" on the wall. According to Chang-Tai Hung, the painting "became a celebrated propaganda piece".

In February 1954 <a href="Gao%20Gang">Gao Gang</a>, the head of the State Planning Council, was purged from government; he killed himself only months later. His presence in the painting immediately on Mao's left placed arts officials in a quandary. Given its popularity among officials and the people, "The Founding of the Nation" had to be shown at the Second National Arts Exhibition (1955), but it was unthinkable that Gao, deemed a traitor, should be depicted. Accordingly Dong was ordered to remove Gao from the painting, which he did.
In erasing Gao, Dong expanded the basket of pink chrysanthemums which stands at the officials' feet, and completed the depiction of Yongdingmen gate, in the original seen only in part behind Gao. He was forced to expand the section of sky seen above the people assembled in Tiananmen Square, which affected the placement of Mao as the center of attention. He compensated for this, to some extent, by adding two more microphones to Mao's right. Julia Andrews, in her book on the art of the People's Republic, suggested that Dong's solution was not entirely satisfactory as the microphones dominate the center of the painting, and Mao is diminished by the expanded space around him. The modified painting was shown in the 1955 exhibition, and in 1958 in Moscow. Although the painting was later altered again and does not exist in this form, this version is the one most commonly reproduced.

When the Museum of the Chinese Revolution opened on Tiananmen Square in 1961, the painting was displayed on a huge wall in the gallery devoted to the Communist triumph, but in 1966, during the <a href="Cultural%20Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a>, radicals shut down the museum, and it remained closed until 1969. During that time, <a href="Liu%20Shaoqi">Liu Shaoqi</a>, accused of taking a "capitalist road", was purged from government. His removal from the painting was ordered in 1967, and Dong was tasked to carry it out. Dong had suffered during the Cultural Revolution: accused of being a rightist, he was expelled from the Party for two years, sent to a rural <a href="Labor%20camp">work camp</a>, and then was "<a href="Political%20rehabilitation%23China">rehabilitated</a>" by being made to labor as a steelworker. Dong's task was difficult, as Liu was one of the most prominent figures in the first row, standing to the left of Madame Song. Officials wanted Liu replaced with <a href="Lin%20Biao">Lin Biao</a>, much in Mao's favor at the time. Dong was unwilling to give Lin prominence he had not then had, and though he could not refuse outright at the dangerous time of the Cultural Revolution, he eventually got permission to merely remove Liu. The figure was too large to simply delete, so Liu was repainted as Dong Biwu, and made to appear as if in the second row. According to Andrews, the attempt was a failure: "the new Dong Biwu does not recede into the second row as intended. Instead, he appears as a leering, glowing figure, a strangely malevolent character in the midst of an otherwise stately group". Officials deemed the revised work unexhibitable. Andrews speculated that Dong may have been trying to sabotage the change, or may have been affected by the stress of the years of the Cultural Revolution.
In 1972, as part of a renovation of the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, officials wanted to exhibit Dong's painting again, but they decreed that <a href="Lin%20Boqu">Lin Boqu</a>, whose white-haired figure was furthest left, must be removed. This was because the <a href="Gang%20of%20Four">Gang of Four</a>, then in control of China, blamed Lin Boqu (who had died in 1960) for opposing the marriage, in the revolutionary days, of Mao with <a href="Jiang%20Qing">Jiang Qing</a> (one of the Four). Sources differ on what took place regarding the painting: Chang-Tai Hung related that Dong, terminally ill with cancer, could not make the changes, so his student Jin Shangyi and another artist, Zhao Yu, were assigned to do the work. The two feared damaging the original canvas, so made an exact replica but for the required changes, with Dong brought forth from his hospital for consultations. According to Andrews, Jin and Zhao created the new version because Dong would not let anyone else alter his painting. Jin later stated that the painting, while effective politically, also shows Dong's inner world.

With the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976 and the subsequent accession of <a href="Deng%20Xiaoping">Deng Xiaoping</a>, many of the purged figures of earlier years were <a href="Political%20rehabilitation%23China">rehabilitated</a>, and the authorities in 1979 decided to bring more historical accuracy to the painting. Dong had died in 1973; his family strongly opposed anyone altering the original painting, and the government respected their wishes. Jin was on a tour outside China, so the government assigned Yan Zhenduo to make changes to the replica. He placed Liu, Lin Boqu and Gao in the painting and made other changes: a previously unidentifiable man in the back row now resembles Deng Xiaoping. The replica painting was restored to the Museum of the Chinese Revolution.

The painting was reproduced on <a href="Postage%20stamps%20and%20postal%20history%20of%20China%23People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">Chinese postage stamps</a> in 1959 and 1999, for the tenth and fiftieth anniversaries of the founding of the People's Republic. Also in 1999, the museum authorized a private company to make small-scale gold foil reproductions of the painting. Dong's family sued, and in 2002 the courts found that Dong's heirs held the copyright to the painting, and that the museum only had the right to exhibit it. Joe McDonald of the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> deemed the upholding of the copyright "a triumph for China's capitalist ambitions over its leftist history". In 2014, the art museum at CAFA held a retrospective of Dong's works, exhibiting the small-scale draft of the painting, possessed by Dong's family, for the first time. Fan Di'an, curator of the exhibition, stated, "The changes to the painting tell a bitter story, reflecting the political influences on art. But it didn't affect Dong Xiwen's love of art."
Wu Hung described "The Founding of the Nation" as "arguably the most celebrated work of official Chinese art". He noted that the painting is the only "canonized" one depicting the October 1 ceremony, and that other artists have tended to give the people's perspective, subjecting themselves to Mao's gaze. The painting is a modern-day example of "<a href="damnatio%20memoriae">damnatio memoriae</a>", the alteration of artworks or other objects to remove the image or name of a disfavored person. Deng Zhangyu, in a 2014 article, called the painting "the most significant historical image of China's founding". Wu Hung suggested that the alterations to it over the years, while always showing Mao proclaiming the new government, parallel the changes that have come to China's leadership during the years of Communist governance. Andrews wrote that "its greatest importance to the art world was its elevation as a model of party-approved oil painting". Writer Wu Bing in 2009 called it "a milestone in Chinese oil painting, boldly incorporating national styles". The painting has never been as highly regarded in the West as in China; according to Andrews, "art history students have been known to roar with laughter when slides of it appear on the screen". Art historian <a href="Michael%20Sullivan%20%28art%20historian%29">Michael Sullivan</a> dismissed it as mere propaganda. Today, following a merger of museums, both paintings are in the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20China">National Museum of China</a>, on Tiananmen Square.

Lost Luggage (video game)

Lost Luggage is an <a href="action%20game">action video game</a> developed and released in 1982 for the <a href="Atari%202600">Atari 2600</a> by Texas-based studio <a href="Games%20by%20Apollo">Games by Apollo</a>. The player controls <a href="skycap">skycap</a>s working at an airport and tries to collect pieces of luggage that fall overhead from a frantic <a href="luggage%20carousel">luggage carousel</a>. A two-player mode, in which the second player controls the direction the luggage falls, is also available.

Programmer Ed Salvo was inspired to make "Lost Luggage" when he was waiting for his luggage at the <a href="Dallas/Fort%20Worth%20International%20Airport">Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport</a>, and the game took around four weeks to produce. Reviewers criticized the game's similarity to <a href="Activision">Activision</a>'s "<a href="Kaboom%21%20%28video%20game%29">Kaboom!</a>"—which itself is based on <a href="Avalanche%20%28video%20game%29">Avalanche</a>—believing "Lost Luggage" to be an inferior clone.

"Lost Luggage" is an <a href="action%20game">action game</a> in which the player controls <a href="skycap">skycap</a> <a href="Porter%20%28carrier%29">porters</a> who are attempting to collect falling luggage from a wildly unpredictable <a href="baggage%20carousel">baggage carousel</a>. The objective is to collect all the suitcases that fall from the carousel before they hit the ground. The player starts with three suitcases, which act as <a href="life%20%28gaming%29">lives</a>, and whenever a suitcase hits the floor, the player loses one. If all of the player's suitcases are lost, the game ends.

There are two difficulty levels, and depending on the difficulty selected, players can control one skycap or two at once. There is also a two-player competitive mode where the second player controls the direction of the flying baggage. Another mode, featuring "terrorist suitcases", is available; enabling this mode will cause black suitcases to appear mixed with the regular baggage. These black suitcases will cause the game to instantly end if they touch the floor, regardless of the player's current number of collected suitcases.

"Lost Luggage" was developed by <a href="Games%20by%20Apollo">Games by Apollo</a>, a video game studio based in <a href="Richardson%2C%20Texas">Richardson, Texas</a>, which targeted the game at people who traveled regularly, believing that they would like its content. At the time of "Lost Luggage"s development, the company employed five people. The game was conceived by programmer Ed Salvo. He had been at the <a href="Dallas/Fort%20Worth%20International%20Airport">Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport</a> after a meeting with Apollo founder Pat Roper and was waiting at the carousel for his luggage to arrive. Later, Salvo discussed the concept of the game with Roper, and they came up with the idea to have the carousel "spewing unmentionables."

Afterwards, Salvo presented artist Ernie Runyon with a rough sketch of his ideas for the game. The crew of Apollo <a href="brainstorming">brainstormed</a> titles for half an hour before deciding on "Lost Luggage"; Runyon later remembered one of the proposed titles was "Airport Mayhem". Runyon programmed the game with help from Salvo. He has stated he would have liked to include a luggage train, but there was not enough room in the 4-<a href="kilobyte">kilobyte</a> cartridge. Salvo had difficulties with <a href="collision%20detection">collision detection</a> and synchronizing the character movements with the joystick, which took one week to fix. Due to a hardware issue, a graphical bug would also occur whenever a suitcase was captured, which was solved by compiling the game on another computer.

The sound effects and music for "Lost Luggage" were created by Larry Minor. According to Runyon, the game was the first to integrate music on the 2600 as opposed to only sound effects. Salvo estimated that "Lost Luggage" took a total of four weeks to complete. A four-minute advertising jingle was made by Byron Parks for the game. Apollo founder Pat Roper was "fishing for ad material", and Parks belonged to a sound studio which Roper also owned. The jingle was never used, and in a 2013 interview Runyon recalled that he did not "know or remember where it was intended for use."

Following the release of "Lost Luggage", Runyon departed Games by Apollo, making it the only game he worked on at the studio. Salvo eventually left as well. The studio filed for <a href="Chapter%2011%20bankruptcy">Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> on November 12, 1982, due to pressure from its advertising agency <a href="Benton%20%26amp%3B%20Bowles">Benton & Bowles</a>, to which Apollo owed $2.5 million (out of a $5 million total debt). Although Roper expected the company to return in a "smaller form", Apollo closed in 1983 after reorganization attempts failed.

Games by Apollo released "Lost Luggage" in September 1982. Two versions were released, differentiated by the color of the label. Cartridges with blue labels feature an opening sequence in which the character takes out the three starting suitcases. In the green-labeled version, the game may be restarted by pressing the fire button, which does nothing in the blue-labeled version. Neither Salvo nor Runyon were aware of the existence of this version. Runyon speculated that Salvo may have found more space after <a href="tweaking">tweaking</a> the game and added the features, while Salvo did not "remember doing any of this and I can't conceive of anyone at Apollo messing with the game after it went to production."

"Lost Luggage" received mixed reviews upon release. <a href="Bill%20Kunkel%20%28gaming%29">Bill Kunkel</a> and Arnie Katz wrote in a 1982 issue of the magazine "<a href="Electronic%20Games">Electronic Games</a>" that "Lost Luggage" did not have "the spark of greatness". While they praised the game for shifting away from "the typical SF shoot-out" and said that it was "solid" and "playable", they remarked on its plain-looking graphics and said that "even the greatest concept cannot make a great game when it isn't blended with an outstanding type of play action." Writing for "Video", Kunkel and Katz commented on the game's "incredibly cute touches", but suggested that Apollo may have better "scrimp[ed] on the frills" in favor of additional gameplay challenges. <a href="Danny%20Goodman">Danny Goodman</a> of "<a href="Creative%20Computing">Creative Computing</a> Video & Arcade Games" wrote that "graphics are fun to watch, but the game play for experienced players gets old fast". A reviewer for the magazine "TV Gamer" recommended the game for children, but felt that seasoned video game players would enjoy "<a href="Kaboom%21%20%28video%20game%29">Kaboom!</a>" more. More positive opinions were from "<a href="Videogaming%20Illustrated">Videogaming Illustrated</a>", which described the game as the most charming of Apollo's releases, and "<a href="Texas%20Monthly">Texas Monthly</a>", which described it as a "fiendish little amusement."

Modern reviews have been largely critical – Brett Alan Weiss, writing for <a href="AllGame">AllGame</a>, considered the game to be a "slower, less intense, less enjoyable" version of "Kaboom!". He criticized the lack of support for the <a href="Paddle%20%28game%20controller%29">paddle</a> controller, and stated that not even the two-player and terrorist modes made the game enjoyable. In his book "Classic Home Video Games", Weiss wrote that "Lost Luggage" was a "fleeting pleasure", opining that "the airplanes flying overhead look nice, but the rest of the game is ordinary in appearance" and that the difficulty curve and action were poor. Writing for Atari HQ, Keita Iida commented that "there are good "Kaboom!" clones ("<a href="Eggomania">Eggomania</a>") and then there are bad ones (this one)." Iida believed that if the game was not as similar to "Kaboom!" then it would be "mildly amusing", but that the better alternatives hampered it.

Freedom Planet

Freedom Planet is a <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">2D</a> <a href="platform%20game">platform</a> video game developed and published by GalaxyTrail, a studio set up by designer Stephen DiDuro. The player controls one of three <a href="anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> animal protagonists: the dragon Lilac, the <a href="wildcat">wildcat</a> Carol, or the <a href="basset%20hound">basset hound</a> Milla. Aided by the duck-like Torque, the player attempts to defeat Lord Brevon, who plans to conquer the galaxy. While the game focuses on fast-paced platforming, its levels are interspersed with slower <a href="action%20video%20game">action</a> scenes.

"Freedom Planet" began development as a "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" <a href="fangame">fangame</a>, but DiDuro lost interest in creating a <a href="derivative%20work">derivative work</a> and reconceived the project as his own <a href="intellectual%20property">intellectual property</a>. He visited the website <a href="DeviantArt">DeviantArt</a> to recruit artist Ziyo Ling, who replaced the existing cast of characters with her own. Lilac, originally a <a href="hedgehog">hedgehog</a>, became a dragon; antagonist <a href="Doctor%20Eggman">Doctor Eggman</a> was replaced by Brevon; and the "Sonic" series' <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%23Common%20features">ring</a>-based <a href="health%20%28gaming%29">health</a> system was abandoned. Further changes were suggested by fans and incorporated throughout development. "Freedom Planet" was developed in Denmark and the United States and its art direction has <a href="East%20Asia">East Asia</a>n influences: its <a href="Environment%20artist">background visuals</a> were inspired by medieval <a href="Chinese%20art">Chinese art</a>, and the game's title is written in <a href="katakana">katakana</a>.

The game was released for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, first as a demo in August 2012, then, after a successful <a href="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> campaign, as a full game via <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> in July 2014. The game was later released on the <a href="Wii%20U">Wii U</a> in October 2015, on the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> in 2017, and on the <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> in August 2018. "Freedom Planet" has been widely compared to the early "Sonic" games. Critics praised its gameplay, aesthetics, and balance of "Sonic" elements with original content, but were mixed on its pacing and length. A sequel, "<a href="Freedom%20Planet%202">Freedom Planet 2</a>", will be released in 2019.

"Freedom Planet" is a <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">2D</a> <a href="platform%20game">platform</a> and <a href="action%20game">action</a> game featuring anthropomorphized animal characters and 16-bit style graphics mimicking the look of games released for the <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a>, particularly the "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28series%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" series. The game puts players in the role of one of the available playable characters as they traverse each level, fighting enemies and obstacles before facing a <a href="boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss</a> at the end. Players have a health meter, which can be replenished by collecting red leaves, and a regenerative energy meter used to perform each character's unique special moves. Players can earn <a href="1-up">extra lives</a> by collecting blue crystals found throughout the level, or by rescuing creatures trapped in cages. Players can also obtain various types of shields, some of which often bonus attributes such as invulnerability to fire or the ability to breathe underwater, and invincibility power-ups. Cards are hidden through the levels, which unlock bonus content such as music and concept art, and bonus tokens which allows access to a bonus game at the end of the level.

The game has three playable characters that are the protagonists: Lilac, Carol, and Milla. Each character has Melee attacks and a unique array of moves which allow them to traverse the environment in different ways. Lilac can perform a double-jump attack and can launch herself into an air dash, allowing her to bounce off walls and reach high areas. Carol is able to curl into a spin-attack while running and can climb up walls. By picking up gas canisters, Carol can bring out her motorcycle, which can double-jump and ride up vertical walls. Milla can throw gelatinous cubes and put up an offensive shield, combining the two to perform a Shield Blast, and flap her ears to reach high areas.

Players can play through the main game in one of two ways; Adventure, which tells the game's story through the perspective of a chosen character, and Classic, in which the levels are played in order without any story cutscenes. Time Attack mode allows the player to attempt to complete levels in the quickest time possible.

The game begins as Sash Lilac and Carol Tea—an <a href="anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> dragon and <a href="wildcat">wildcat</a> —rescue a duck-billed creature named Torque after his <a href="spacecraft">spacecraft</a> crash lands. At Torque's request, the three set out to protect a powerful relic called the Kingdom Stone. This involves them in a conflict between three nations on their planet: Shuigang, a country militarized by its new king, Dail; Shang Mu, led by the wealth-obsessed Mayor Zao ( or ); and Shang Tu, whose Royal Magister is unprepared for war. Lilac and Carol rush to the Kingdom Stone's shrine but are waylaid by the Shang Tu officers General Gong and Neera Li, who doubt that the Stone is threatened. The protagonists arrive just as the Stone is stolen by Spade, a henchman of Zao. After the shrine collapses, Carol is separated from Lilac and pinned by rubble, but she is saved by the timid <a href="basset%20hound">basset hound</a> Milla () Basset.

That night, Torque tells Lilac, Carol, and Milla that he is an alien sent to apprehend the intergalactic warlord Arktivus Brevon, whose spacecraft wrecked on the planet. Brevon has invaded Shuigang, murdered its king, and <a href="Mind%20control">brainwashed</a> Dail to be his servant. He intends to steal the Stone to power his ship. The protagonists decide to reclaim the Stone from Zao, but they are accosted en route by Spade and by Brevon's assistant Serpentine. The delays give Dail and Brevon's forces time to steal the relic. Afterwards, Zao sends the protagonists as emissaries to Shang Tu to discuss an alliance against Shuigang. They are detained by the Magister upon their arrival, as Neera blames them for the Stone's original disappearance. Torque is acquitted when Lilac falsely pleads guilty. She, Carol, and Milla quickly break out of jail to reunite with Torque, only to see him captured by Brevon and Serpentine.

Carol quarrels with Lilac and storms off. Lilac sends Milla to find her and then goes to save Torque from Brevon's nearby base, but she is captured and tortured by Brevon. Meanwhile, Carol and Milla ally with Spade to storm the base, where they rescue Torque and Lilac. They are all separated in the ensuing conflict. Neera finds Lilac, arrests her, and brings her back to Shang Tu, where the Magister determines that she is innocent and reveals that Zao is challenging Shuigang for the Stone. Lilac rejoins her friends and convinces Shang Mu and Shang Tu to unite against Dail and Brevon's army. During the battle, Brevon announces that his ship is repaired, and Lilac, Milla, and Carol board it. The team combats Brevon's minions, including a mutated Serpentine. Brevon captures Milla and turns her into a grotesque monster that attacks the other protagonists, who are forced to render her unconscious. Enraged, Lilac and Carol attack and defeat Brevon, but the Kingdom Stone is destroyed in the process. Shortly after the battle, Milla awakens in a medical tent and sees the sky lit up by swirling, crystalline energy released from the Kingdom Stone. The three kingdoms resolve to harness the Stone's power and share it equally, thereby bringing an end to the war. Torque says goodbye to Lilac, Carol, and Milla and returns to space.

"Freedom Planet" was conceived in late 2011 by American game designer and programmer Stephen DiDuro, who had just founded the <a href="Independent%20video%20game%20development">independent development</a> studio GalaxyTrail Games. Although it is an original <a href="intellectual%20property">intellectual property</a>, "Freedom Planet" was first developed as a "Sonic" <a href="fangame">fangame</a>: it contained <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28series%29%23Common%20features">rings</a>, and <a href="Doctor%20Eggman">Doctor Eggman</a> was the villain. DiDuro decided that the "Sonic" affiliation would hold back the game and attempted without success to design his own characters. Afterward, he received permission from the Chinese artist Ziyo Ling—whom he had found on the art website <a href="DeviantArt">DeviantArt</a>—to use her character Sash Lilac, and later, Carol and Milla in his game. The soundtrack was composed by DiDuro in collaboration with Shane "Blue Warrior" Ellis and user Leila "Woofle" Wilson.

Early on, DiDuro got encouraged to separate it further from "Sonic", so he replaced rings with red leaves and altered the characters' abilities. Ziyo had drawn Lilac as a hedgehog, but DiDuro redesigned the character to be a dragon. Lilac's wall-bouncing was based on a similar <a href="Game%20mechanics">game mechanic</a> from "<a href="Ristar">Ristar</a>". Originally, her level of energy was to be dependent on her speed, but this proved too difficult to control.

While "Freedom Planet" was developed in Denmark and the United States, its art direction was influenced by medieval <a href="East%20Asia">East Asia</a>n art, particularly that of <a href="Chinese%20art">China</a>. The game's visuals reference modern <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> and <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> as well. Much of the text in the game world is written in <a href="Chinese%20characters">Chinese characters</a>, and the title text is subtitled in <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a> <a href="katakana">katakana</a> as , but the game originally did not support the Japanese language.

"Freedom Planet" was first released as a <a href="Technology%20demonstration">demo</a> for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> in August 2012. After a full version of the game was funded through <a href="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a>, it was taken to <a href="Steam%20Greenlight">Steam Greenlight</a> and approved for <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a>. Its release was first projected for early 2014, then delayed to June 30. Shortly before that date, it was delayed again to July 19: the developers wanted to promote the game at a convention in <a href="Miami">Miami</a>, Florida, and to avoid competition from the heavily discounted products in Steam's Summer Sale. The game was released, after a third delay, on July 21. To advertise the game, GalaxyTrail created branded T-shirts, and Lilac was included as an <a href="easter%20egg%20%28media%29">easter egg</a> in the 2013 game "". DiDuro considered and rejected the idea of developing an <a href="Android%20%28software%29">Android</a> version of "Freedom Planet", but he is saving money to <a href="Porting">port</a> the game to the <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a>. The game was released on the website <a href="GOG.com">GOG.com</a> in late 2014. GalaxyTrail also developed versions for <a href="Mac%20OS%20X">Mac OS X</a> and <a href="Linux">Linux</a>, which were released on Steam on April 17, 2015.

On March 9, 2015, Stephen DiDuro announced through Twitter that a version of the game for Nintendo's <a href="Wii%20U">Wii U</a> console was planned for release on the <a href="Nintendo%20eShop">eShop</a> online store for late 2015, later specified as August 13. A demo was released as part of a promotion titled "Nindies@home", wherein players were invited to try several upcoming Wii U games between June 15 and 22. On July 28, GalaxyTrail confirmed that production of the final version of the game was taking longer than expected, suggesting that the game's release would be later. DiDuro announced the cause of the delay on August 18: the Wii U version had been set back by a "console-freezing bug", which would postpone the Wii U release indefinitely until the issue was fixed. He later explained that the bug had taken so long to detect because it only occurred in retail versions of the console, which had prevented GalaxyTrail and Nintendo from learning of the issue. The bug required a hard reset of the system to address the problem, which could potentially cause damage to the Wii U hardware. The bug was eventually fixed, and the game was successfully released on the eShop on October 1; customers who had tried the game's demo were rewarded with a 15-percent discount.

In November 2015, GalaxyTrail joined forces with the <a href="subscription%20box">subscription box</a> company <a href="IndieBox">IndieBox</a> distribute an exclusive physical release of "Freedom Planet". This limited collector's edition box included a flash-drive with a <a href="DRM-Free">DRM-free</a> game file, the official two-disc soundtrack, an instruction manual and <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> key, along with various custom-designed collectibles.

<a href="Downloadable%20content">Downloadable content</a> (DLC) was created for the game. The first packs, which add Torque as a playable character and an adventure story for Milla, was released for computers in December 2015. An additional update to make Spade a playable character, was planned for release in 2016 but has been postponed. A version for the <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> was released by <a href="Xseed%20Games">Xseed Games</a> on August 30, 2018.
Tony Ponce of <a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a> reacted positively about the demo for "Freedom Planet"; and commented that it was "nice to see a well-established style or formula applied to a new world with original characters". Similarly, <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>'s Jeffrey Matulef described the game's preview as "an indie "Sonic"-esque platformer done right", and enjoyed the redesigned health system. Dominic Tarison of IndieStatik complimented the game's "new and unfamiliar configuration" of elements from classic 16-bit games, but criticised the amount of viewable gameplay area. John Polson of <a href="IndieGames.com">IndieGames.com</a> believed that "the spectacles like loops and wall runs ... [are not] as magical to do or watch" as in "Sonic" games, but he encouraged platformer fans to download the demo.

Nathan Grayson of <a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a> praised the demo for its balance of Genesis "Sonic" elements and original content: he described the product as "a love letter to classic "Sonic", except when it's not". He praised the game's enemies, but experienced minor control issues. Pacing was remarked to be slower than that of the Genesis "Sonic" games because of the added combat sequences, though Grayson felt that this gave the player time to explore and appreciate the level design. Grayson was critical of the voice acting. Ponce strongly praised the visuals, though criticized the bland foreground design. Polson noted minor audio and visual flaws, most notably the recycling of sound effects from Genesis "Sonic" games, but he lauded the game's music. Tarison praised the music and visuals, as well as the varied designs of the environments and playable characters.

Reviewing the full version, Jahanzeb Khan of "<a href="Hardcore%20Gamer">Hardcore Gamer</a>" felt that it was a worthy successor to the 1994 game "<a href="Sonic%203%20%26amp%3B%20Knuckles">Sonic 3 & Knuckles</a>"—which he considered the series' pinnacle—and that it was "perhaps the most "Sonic" game to have come out since 1994, one that feels like a true evolution and more importantly a resounding step forward." Jonatan Allin of the Danish version of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>, who had not enjoyed any "Sonic" games since the Genesis era, concurred with Khan. <a href="Polygon%20%28website%29">Polygon</a>'s Griffin McElroy argued that "Freedom Planet" successfully performs "a difficult balancing act, borrowing and transforming elements from games like "Sonic the Hedgehog" and "<a href="Rocket%20Knight%20Adventures">Rocket Knight Adventures</a>" without coming off as derivative". McElroy and Pablo Taboada of the Spanish-language website MeriStation both compared the game to the work of developer <a href="Treasure%20%28company%29">Treasure</a>. Taboada lamented the game's obscurity and suggested that, had Treasure obtained the rights to "Sonic" and released "Freedom Planet" as an official sequel, it would have been more popular.

Khan commented that the levels "never feel like they're over too soon nor do they drag on unnecessarily", and he appreciated the <a href="setpiece">setpiece</a> moments such as "explosive chase/escape sequences, maze like labyrinths, traps, and even <a href="shoot-%27em-up">shoot-'em-up</a> style shooting segments". Taboada was mixed on the game's brevity: he thought it was suitable for <a href="speedrunning">speedrunning</a> but unsatisfying for those seeking a deeper experience. By contrast, Japanese website 4Gamer stated that the game's quirks allowed one to play extensively without boredom, and Taboada enjoyed the large, <a href="Metroidvania">Metroidvania</a>-style levels.

Regarding the game's visuals, Taboada said, "Técnicamente es excelso" (technically, it is excellent). He praised the colorful and detailed backgrounds, expressive character animations, sound effects, and music. Khan agreed: he commented that "every inch of it exud[es] artistic diversity with high resolution sprites that resemble the quality of yesteryear". He called the audio a "nice mix of catchy <a href="chiptune">chiptune</a> style melodies with infectious synthetic beats". Both Khan and 4Gamer were intrigued by the game's East Asian visual style. Taboada believed that each character was likeable and interesting to play. Allin found himself unexpectedly captivated by the story, which he guessed many players would miss due to impatience with cutscenes.

On December 25, 2015, GalaxyTrail announced "Freedom Planet 2" was in development. In contrast to the original title, it is being built using the <a href="Unity%20%28game%20engine%29">Unity framework</a> and has higher pixel art resolution than its predecessor. With the goal of "defin[ing] "Freedom Planet"s identity as a franchise", all characters from the game received a design overhaul by <a href="Tyson%20Tan">Tyson Tan</a>. While the early concept artworks on the game's official website remain unchanged, Tyson had been experimenting with the new art style with the fans. <a href="Christian%20Whitehead">Christian Whitehead</a>, who lead the development on "<a href="Sonic%20Mania">Sonic Mania</a>", will be involved with development as he will be helping DiDuro with programming, being responsible for porting over the physics from <a href="Clickteam%20Fusion">Clickteam Fusion</a> over to Unity's engine.

1850 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1850 Atlantic hurricane season was the last season excluded from the scope of the official <a href="HURDAT">Atlantic hurricane database</a>. Although meteorological records are sparse and generally incomplete, they indicate that three significant tropical cyclones affected land, each causing some degree of damage. The first system struck North Carolina on July 18, causing significant damage before battering the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20states">Mid-Atlantic states</a> with high tides, strong winds, and heavy rainfall. Torrential rainfall caused river flooding from <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> to <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, particularly along the <a href="Schuylkill%20River">Schuylkill River</a>, which took the lives of 20 people in various incidents. Strong winds damaged property and public facilities in and around New York City, and damaging floods extended into central and northern <a href="New%20England">New England</a>. Crops and railroad infrastructure suffered throughout the entire region.

On August 22, a strong hurricane impacted <a href="Havana">Havana</a>, Cuba, destroying fruit trees and disrupting shipping, before making landfall on the <a href="Florida%20Panhandle">Florida Panhandle</a> with an enormous <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a>. Coastal flooding was severe around <a href="Apalachicola%2C%20Florida">Apalachicola</a>, and as the storm moved inland, it generated destructive winds across the southeastern United States. Abundant precipitation fell from Georgia through Virginia, causing extensive flooding; one river swelled over 20 feet (6 m) above its normal height. The storm blew down crops and trees along its course, and toppled a large railroad bridge near <a href="Halifax%2C%20North%20Carolina">Halifax, North Carolina</a>. Offshore, a <a href="pilot%20boat">pilot boat</a> collided with a larger ship in the rough seas and sank. Considered the worst storm in nearly 30 years in the <a href="tidewater%20region">tidewater region</a> of Virginia, the cyclone briefly reentered the Atlantic off New Jersey before making landfall over New England. Strong winds and moderate to heavy rains plagued much of New England on August 24 and 25.

On September 7 and 8, a hurricane brushed the coastline from New York to <a href="Cape%20Cod">Cape Cod</a> with gusty winds and appreciable rainfall, and left many ships in distress. The system later struck <a href="Atlantic%20Canada">Atlantic Canada</a>, likely causing "great loss of property and lives", though damage reports were limited. Fragmented records exist of other hurricanes, including two which remained over open seas in early September and the middle of October.

Attempts to catalog Atlantic hurricanes in the first half of the 19th century began as early as 1855, when Andrés Poey compiled information on just over 400 tropical cyclones from 1493 to 1855. However, Poey listed only three of the five or more hurricanes that developed in 1850. In his 1963 book, "Early American Hurricanes, 1492–1870", weather researcher <a href="David%20M.%20Ludlum">David M. Ludlum</a> discusses, in greater detail, three significant tropical cyclones that impacted the United States in 1850. Unusually, all three heavily impacted the northeastern states; Ludlum compares the season to <a href="1954%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1954</a>, in which three major tropical systems impacted the Eastern Seaboard. More traditional hurricane targets, such as Florida, were spared the brunt of seasonal tropical cyclone activity in 1850, while the atmosphere farther north was abnormally tropical. <a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Newark, New Jersey</a>, had its warmest—and one of its rainiest—summers on record at the time, owing to frequent nearby hurricanes and the influx of tropical air. Meteorological reports pertaining to the season were largely lost in a <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> fire in 1856, limiting what is known about hurricane activity in 1850. As the season falls outside the scope of the <a href="HURDAT">Atlantic hurricane database</a> (1851 onward) and its associated <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane%20reanalysis%20project">reanalysis project</a>, records are regarded as incomplete. Extant accounts of the storms in 1850 are chiefly based on private weather records and press reports, and only approximate storm tracks are known.

A strong squall swept across <a href="Matagorda%20Bay">Matagorda Bay</a> in southeastern <a href="Texas">Texas</a> on June 27. High winds ripped a ship from its anchor and drove it aground, and at least one other vessel suffered structural damage. Although it is included in the <a href="Weather%20Prediction%20Center">Weather Prediction Center</a>'s publication, "Texas Hurricane History", little is known about the nature of the storm.

July 10–19. The next documented hurricane in 1850 originated in the Caribbean Sea, where it wrecked dozens of ships along the <a href="Windward%20Islands">Windward Islands</a> on July 11 and 12. On July 18, the storm struck <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> from the south as a hurricane of at least Category 1 intensity (on the modern-day <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20hurricane%20wind%20scale">Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale</a>) and proceeded northward. Although the exact point of landfall is unknown, the system is believed to have moved ashore south of <a href="Cape%20Hatteras">Cape Hatteras</a>. Ships just off the state's coast battled three days of hurricane conditions from July 15 to July 18. Onshore, "great damage" occurred from <a href="Wilmington%2C%20North%20Carolina">Wilmington</a> to <a href="Elizabeth%20City%2C%20North%20Carolina">Elizabeth City</a>.

Intense wave action churned the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>, while storm-heightened tides up to above normal flooded <a href="wharf">wharves</a> and coastal communities. The <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> area endured persistent gale-force winds accompanied by torrential rainfall. As streams and rivers swelled above their banks, cellars and streets became inundated by floodwaters. Many trees were blown down and numerous poorly built or unfinished buildings were destroyed. The storm cut telegraph communications between Baltimore and surrounding areas. In the countryside, low-lying hay fields were flooded and most of the corn crop was decimated. At <a href="Bladensburg%2C%20Maryland">Bladensburg, Maryland</a>, a train station and locomotive were washed into an adjacent flooded waterway. Arrivals of ships into port were delayed by the storm, which one captain held to be the worst he had ever observed, and some vessels incurred extensive damage.

The storm's effects quickly spread northward. Winds at <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> began to increase in the morning on July 18, becoming severe by the evening hours. Air pressure fell to early on July 19 as the hurricane's center passed to the west, and the city received more than of rainfall. The storm wrought significant damage throughout the city, including to trees, signs, and structures. A number of houses were demolished, and many more—including a large brick building near <a href="Rittenhouse%20Square">Rittenhouse Square</a>—suffered damage. Major freshwater flooding was observed in the area, especially along the <a href="Schuylkill%20River">Schuylkill River</a>, which rapidly rose to its highest level since 1838. A large quantity of lumber was swept away, and several docks were submerged. Their "worst apprehensions realized", hundreds of residents worked hurriedly to mitigate damage from the flooding. Bridges over the river at <a href="Phoenixville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Phoenixville</a> were washed away, resulting in the deaths of four individuals. A <a href="Lock%20%28water%20transport%29">lock of a dam</a> upstream of Phoenixville gave way, destroying a boat and killing its occupants. Four men and a child reportedly drowned on the river's banks near <a href="Conshohocken%2C%20Pennsylvania">Conshohocken</a>. Railways were covered with up to 3 feet of water in low-lying spots. Numerous small craft capsized on the Schuylkill and <a href="Delaware%20River">Delaware</a> rivers. Overall, 20 people died in various storm-related tragedies along the Schuylkill.

The hurricane took a heavy toll on agriculture in the Mid-Atlantic states. Rampant flooding outside Philadelphia destroyed fruit orchards, and in nearby <a href="Burlington%2C%20New%20Jersey">Burlington, New Jersey</a>, strong winds and heavy rainfall inflicted significant damage to crops on the night of July 18, leaving entire fields of corn blown down. The Delaware River burst its banks at Burlington, inundating nearby lowlands. Notable flooding also took place along the <a href="Lehigh%20River">Lehigh River</a>. Telegraph lines north of Philadelphia were crippled, limiting communications in the storm's aftermath. Throughout the region, downed trees blocked railways.
Hurricane-force gusts buffeted Newark, New Jersey, and rainfall exceeded a weather observer's <a href="rain%20gauge">rain gauge</a> capacity of . Strong winds imperiled New York City late on July 18 into the next morning; there was widespread tree damage, with branches and leaves littering the ground, and many specimens uprooted or snapped. The storm ruined awnings and tore metal roofs off several buildings. Some ships in <a href="New%20York%20Harbor">New York Harbor</a> were ripped from their anchors and blown aground; further east, multiple <a href="Coastal%20trading%20vessel">coaster vessels</a> were wrecked along the coast of <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>. The winds and <a href="storm%20tide">storm tide</a>s destroyed <a href="bath%20house">bath house</a>s and other facilities at <a href="Coney%20Island">Coney Island</a>.

As the storm tracked northward through central <a href="New%20York%20State">New York State</a>, it produced high southeasterly winds and heavy rainfall across most of <a href="New%20England">New England</a>. At <a href="Fort%20Trumbull">Fort Trumbull</a> along the coast of <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, heavy rainfall starting early on July 19 accumulated to . At <a href="Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">Hartford</a>, flooding caused about $100,000 (1850 USD) in losses. Southeasterly winds peaked at tropical storm-force. Damage to property and crops was confined to western New England, leaving areas such as eastern <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> unscathed. Less substantial rain was reported at <a href="Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Providence</a>, amounting to . The rain shield extended into far-northern New England, producing of precipitation at <a href="Montpelier%2C%20Vermont">Montpelier, Vermont</a>, and at <a href="Burlington%2C%20Vermont">Burlington</a>. The resultant flooding was in some cases the greatest in recent memory.

August 16–25. A tropical system first observed near <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a> on August 16 proceeded to affect the Windward Islands before yielding hurricane conditions at <a href="Ponce%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">Ponce, Puerto Rico</a>, on August 20. Two days later, the hurricane tracked over western <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, causing severe weather conditions around <a href="Havana">Havana</a>. The storm destroyed large swaths of banana and plantain trees, and all vessels in <a href="Havana%20Harbor">Havana Harbor</a> dragged anchors at the height of the hurricane.

The storm moved north over the eastern <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, striking the <a href="Florida%20Panhandle">Florida Panhandle</a> between <a href="Pensacola%2C%20Florida">Pensacola</a> and <a href="Panama%20City%2C%20Florida">Panama City</a> on August 23. Extremely high tides bombarded the <a href="Apalachicola%2C%20Florida">Apalachicola</a> area, resulting in extensive coastal flooding. The hurricane destroyed wharves and left many ships damaged or foundered. Sea water intrusion inundated warehouses and streets in Apalachicola, and one street was made impassable by strewn debris and fallen trees. Farther east, a bridge over the <a href="Wakulla%20River">Wakulla River</a> was washed away by raging floodwaters. A long period of high winds was reported at the state's capital city of <a href="Tallahassee%2C%20Florida">Tallahassee</a>. The storm produced some strong winds in interior Georgia on its way to the Carolinas. The destruction of homes, crops, and trees was reported from <a href="Griffin%2C%20Georgia">Griffin</a> through <a href="Augusta%2C%20Georgia">Augusta</a>. Adverse conditions extended westward to <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery, Alabama</a>, where the night of August 23 was marked by high winds and heavy rainfall.

Southeasterly gales had a large impact on shipping interests off North Carolina. Several vessels were imperiled; in one case a <a href="pilot%20boat">pilot boat</a> capsized after colliding with another ship. In light of this incident, the hurricane is listed in the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a>'s contemporary compilation of tropical cyclones that "may have" caused at least 25 fatalities. The storm grounded the <a href="schooner">schooner</a> "H. Wescott" near <a href="Cape%20Fear%2C%20North%20Carolina">Cape Fear</a>.

Gales were reported from <a href="Savannah%2C%20Georgia">Savannah, Georgia</a>, to Wilmington, North Carolina. Near <a href="Halifax%2C%20North%20Carolina">Halifax, North Carolina</a>, the winds toppled a railroad bridge about 450 ft (140 m) long and 60 ft (20 m) high. The storm also ravaged farmland in the area, destroying crops, fences, trees, and structures, and injuring several people. Much damage was reported in the <a href="Raleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina">Raleigh</a> area, and many trees in <a href="New%20Bern%2C%20North%20Carolina">New Bern</a> suffered at least some limb breakage; several large trees were fully uprooted. The local corn crop—already diminished from the July hurricane—was judged completely lost, though property damage was negligible. Offshore winds from the storm created a negative storm surge on the <a href="Neuse%20River">Neuse River</a>, leaving docks dry for a time. Torrential rains over a large area from Georgia to Virginia triggered severe river flooding. The <a href="Dan%20River">Dan River</a>, which flows through North Carolina and Virginia, swelled 20 ft (6 m), amplified to above normal in narrow channels. In the Carolinas, mills, dams, and roads were washed out, and losses in central North Carolina alone totaled an estimated $7 million.

Gale-force winds lashed the <a href="tidewater%20region">tidewater region</a> of Virginia in what was considered the worst storm on the lower Chesapeake Bay since the <a href="1821%20Norfolk%20and%20Long%20Island%20hurricane">1821 Norfolk and Long Island hurricane</a>. A ship called the "Osceola" lost its wheelhouse to the winds, while onshore, the storm razed crops and a few small structures such as barns and outhouses. Affecting many of the same areas as the July hurricane, the cyclone downed trees in and around Baltimore and caused street flooding in Washington, D.C., where a railroad bridge was swept away. The storm began to influence the weather at Philadelphia on the night of August 24. Strong winds out of the north and northeast at Philadelphia and Newark, New Jersey, suggest the center moved off the New Jersey coast and reemerged into the Atlantic. In addition to the gales, more than 3 in (75 mm) of rain fell on Newark on August 25.
Winds at <a href="New%20London%2C%20Connecticut">New London, Connecticut</a>, and Providence, Rhode Island, veered from southeast to south, then west, so the storm center likely tracked somewhere over Connecticut. The storm adversely affected shipping on the <a href="Long%20Island%20Sound">Long Island Sound</a>, and heavy rain fell across much of New England. Fort Trumbull recorded of rain, while fell at Providence; the deluge triggered flash flooding, though few details are known about the extent of the damage.
September 2–9. Shipping data indicates a hurricane formed near <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a> on September 2 and tracked northward into the northeastern Atlantic over the next week. Andrés Poey listed this system as two distinct cyclones, later confirmed by Chenoweth (2006) to be a single storm.

September 4–10. The third and final widely documented hurricane to affect the U.S. East Coast in 1850 remained predominately offshore, but still impacted ships and coastal cities on September 7 and 8. A vessel about east of <a href="Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Atlantic City, New Jersey</a>, intercepted the hurricane's center and recorded a pressure of 988 mbar (29.18 inHg) on the night of September 7. Numerous ships near the <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a> coast were stricken. Gusty winds snapped tree branches in New York City, while Newark received of rain as the hurricane brushed the region. The system probably continued toward the northeast, passing south of <a href="Nantucket">Nantucket</a>, Massachusetts. There, gale-force winds initially blew out of the southeast before shifting to north midday on September 8. Similarly, <a href="Cape%20Cod">Cape Cod</a> experienced blustery conditions accompanied by heavy rainfall, though damage in eastern New England was generally inconsequential. Providence, Rhode Island, received of rain.

The storm later affected the <a href="The%20Maritimes">Canadian Maritimes</a>, causing heavy disruption in Nova Scotia. Downed telegraph wires in the region delayed damage reports until repairs were completed. The cyclone "undoubtedly caused great loss of property and lives along the coast", according to a report from the telegraph office at <a href="Halifax%20%28former%20city%29">Halifax</a>.

October 14–18.
A final hurricane is believed to have existed over the central Atlantic in mid-October, moving from near 24.5°N, 47°W to 25.5°N, 41°W over the course of four days.

Operation Goodwood (naval)

Operation Goodwood was a series of British carrier air raids conducted against the <a href="German%20battleship%20Tirpitz">German battleship "Tirpitz"</a> at her anchorage in <a href="K%C3%A5fjorden%20%28Alta%29">Kaafjord</a>, Norway, during late August 1944. It was the last of <a href="List%20of%20Allied%20attacks%20on%20the%20German%20battleship%20Tirpitz">attack on "Tirpitz"</a> made by the <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home Fleet</a> during 1944, to eliminate the threat "Tirpitz" posed to Allied shipping by badly damaging or sinking the warship. Previous raids on Kaafjord conducted by <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a> aircraft had involved only one air attack, in Operation Goodwood several attacks were made over a week. The Royal Navy hoped that these raids would wear down the formidable German defences.

The British fleet departed its base on 18 August and launched the first raid against Kaafjord on the morning of 22 August. The attack failed and a small raid that evening inflicted little damage. Attacks were conducted on 24 and 29 August and were also failures. "Tirpitz" had been hit by two bombs during the raid on 24 August but neither caused significant damage. British losses during Operation Goodwood were 17 aircraft to all causes, a <a href="frigate">frigate</a> sunk by a submarine and an <a href="escort%20carrier">escort carrier</a> badly damaged. German forces suffered the loss of 12 aircraft and damage to 7 ships.

In late August 1944, responsibility for attacking "Tirpitz" was transferred to the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>. In three <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a> raids conducted during September and October 1944, the battleship was first crippled and then sunk. Historians regard Operation Goodwood as a significant failure for the Fleet Air Arm and attribute its results to shortcomings of its aircraft and their armament.

From early 1942, "Tirpitz" posed a significant threat to the <a href="Arctic%20convoys%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied convoys</a> transporting supplies through the <a href="Norwegian%20Sea">Norwegian Sea</a> to the Soviet Union. Stationed in <a href="fjord">fjord</a>s on the Norwegian coast, the battleship was capable of overwhelming the close-escort forces assigned to the Arctic convoys or breaking out into the North Atlantic. To counter this threat, the Allies needed to keep a powerful force of warships with the British <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home Fleet</a>, and <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s accompanied most convoys part of the way to the Soviet Union.
Several air and naval attacks were launched against "Tirpitz" in 1942 and 1943. On 6 March 1942, <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s flying from the aircraft carrier attacked the battleship while she was attempting to intercept <a href="Convoy%20PQ%2012">Convoy PQ 12</a> but did not achieve any hits. Bombers from the Royal Air Force and <a href="Soviet%20Air%20Forces">Soviet Air Forces</a> also attempted to strike "Tirpitz" in her anchorages several times in 1942 and 1943 but failed to inflict any damage. On 23 September 1943, two British <a href="X-class%20submarine">X-class</a> midget submarines penetrated the defences around the battleship's main anchorage at Kaafjord in northern Norway during <a href="Operation%20Source">Operation Source</a>, and placed explosive charges in the water beneath her. This attack caused extensive damage to "Tirpitz", putting her out of service for six months.

Following Operation Source, the task of attacking "Tirpitz" was assigned to the Home Fleet's aircraft carriers. Following months of preparations, a successful attack (<a href="Operation%20Tungsten">Operation Tungsten</a>) involving two strike forces of 20 <a href="Fairey%20Barracuda">Fairey Barracuda</a> dive bombers escorted by 40 fighters was conducted on 3 April 1944. While "Tirpitz"s crew suffered heavy casualties during this operation, the battleship was not badly damaged. Nevertheless, she was placed out of action for several additional months while repairs were completed.

The Home Fleet initiated a further four raids against "Tirpitz" between April and July 1944, though the battleship was only attacked during the last of these operations. These attacks were hindered by the transfer of many of the Home Fleet's airmen to other units following Operation Tungsten, as the replacement aircrew were less experienced. The first raid (Operation Planet) began on 21 April but cancelled three days later when agents stationed near Kaafjord reported bad weather over the target area. The Home Fleet put to sea to attack "Tirpitz" again in mid-May in what was designated Operation Brawn. A strike force of 27 Barracudas escorted by <a href="Vought%20F4U%20Corsair">Vought F4U Corsair</a> and <a href="Supermarine%20Seafire">Supermarine Seafire</a> fighters took off from the carriers and "Victorious" on 15 May, but returned to the ships without attacking after they encountered heavy cloud over Kaafjord. The next raid, Operation Tiger Claw, was initiated in late May but cancelled due to bad weather on the 28th of the month. The subsequent attack (<a href="Operation%20Mascot">Operation Mascot</a>) was timed for mid-July, before the resumption of the Arctic convoys, which had been suspended since April 1944 to free up ships for the <a href="Normandy%20landings">Normandy landings</a>. The strike force of 44 Barracudas and 40 fighters dispatched on 17 July reached the target area, but found "Tirpitz" cloaked in a protective smokescreen and the attack failed to inflict any damage on the battleship.

In the weeks after Operation Mascot, "Tirpitz" continued to prepare for potential combat operations. Following trials in the sheltered waters of <a href="Altafjord">Altafjord</a>, she put to sea on 31 July and 1 August to train with her protective destroyers. Additional smoke generators were also installed around Kaafjord to improve the area's already strong defences. These activities were reported by spies, and the British <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> interpreted them to mean that "Tirpitz" was being readied for a raid against Allied shipping. To defend against this threat, it was decided to conduct further attacks against the battleship at her anchorage in Kaafjord at the time of the next series of Arctic convoys. In reality, the German Navy was not planning to use "Tirpitz" offensively as she would be very vulnerable to the superior Allied naval and air forces if she put to sea. Instead, the battleship was being maintained in active service to tie down Allied warships and aircraft.

The failure of Operation Mascot convinced the commander of the Home Fleet, Admiral <a href="Henry%20Ruthven%20Moore">Sir Henry Moore</a>, that the <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm">Fleet Air Arm's</a> main strike aircraft, the Fairey Barracuda dive bomber, was not suited to operations against Kaafjord. As the dive bombers' slow speed gave the defenders of Kaafjord enough time to cover "Tirpitz" in a smoke screen between the time incoming raids were detected and their arrival over the target area, Moore concluded that further attacks using these aircraft would be futile. However, the Admiralty judged that repeatedly striking Kaafjord with Barracudas over a 48-hour period might wear down the German defences and exhaust the supply of fuel for "Tirpitz"s protective smoke generators. Consideration was also given to flying fast and long-ranged <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">de Havilland Mosquito</a> bombers off the carriers in an attempt to achieve surprise, but none of these land-based aircraft could be spared from supporting the Allied bombing of Germany. Despite his misgivings, Moore agreed to make another attempt to strike "Tirpitz".

As proposed by the Admiralty, Moore's plans for the new attack on Kaafjord involved the Home Fleet's aircraft attacking the region over several days. While the fighter aircraft involved in the previous raids had used only their machine guns to <a href="Strafing">strafe</a> German defences in order to reduce the threat they posed to the Barracudas, it was decided to use some of these aircraft as <a href="dive-bombing">dive bombers</a> during Operation Goodwood. In preparation, the two squadrons of Corsairs and single squadron of <a href="Grumman%20F6F%20Hellcat">Grumman F6F Hellcat</a>s selected to participate in the attack received training in dive-bombing tactics during the period between Operations Mascot and Goodwood. Another new element of the plans was a decision to use Fleet Air Arm aircraft to drop <a href="Naval%20mine">mines</a> near "Tirpitz" and the entrance to Kaafjord. The mines dropped near the battleship were to be fitted with time-delay fuses, and it was hoped that the explosions of these devices would cause "Tirpitz"s captain to try to move the warship into safer waters and pass through the minefield at the fjord's entrance. During the period before Operation Goodwood, the Home Fleet's flying squadrons conducted training exercises using a target range at <a href="Loch%20Eriboll">Loch Eriboll</a> in northern Scotland; the terrain in this area is comparable to that around Kaafjord, and the loch had also been used for this purpose as part of the preparations for Operation Tungsten.

The Operation Goodwood attack fleet was divided into three groups. Admiral Moore embarked on board the battleship , which sailed with the fleet aircraft carriers (the flagship of Rear Admiral <a href="Rhoderick%20McGrigor">Rhoderick McGrigor</a>, commander of the 1st Cruiser Squadron), and "Furious" as well as two <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s and fourteen <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s. The second force comprised the escort carriers and , cruiser and a group of frigates. A pair of <a href="Replenishment%20oiler">fleet oilers</a> escorted by four <a href="corvette">corvette</a>s sailed separately to support the two attack groups.

The aircraft carriers embarked the largest group of Fleet Air Arm aircraft assembled up to that point in the war. Their main striking element was the 35 Barracudas assigned to <a href="820%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">820</a>, <a href="826%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">826</a>, <a href="827%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">827</a>, and <a href="828%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">828 Naval Air Squadron</a>s which operated from the three fleet carriers. The two units of 6 Naval Fighter Wing, <a href="1841%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">1841</a> and <a href="1842%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">1842 Squadrons</a>, flew 30 Corsairs from "Formidable". A total of 48 Seafires were assigned to <a href="801%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">801</a>, <a href="880%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">880</a>, <a href="887%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">887</a> and <a href="894%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">894 Squadrons</a> on board "Indefatigable" and "Furious". In addition, <a href="1770%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">1770</a> and <a href="1840%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">1840 Squadrons</a> operated 12 <a href="Fairey%20Firefly">Fairey Firefly</a> and 12 Hellcat fighters respectively from "Indefatigable". The two escort carriers embarked a total of 20 <a href="Grumman%20TBF%20Avenger">Grumman TBF Avenger</a>s (which had responsibility for the mine-dropping element of Operation Goodwood) and 8 <a href="Grumman%20F4F%20Wildcat">Grumman F4F Wildcat</a> fighters; these aircraft were split between <a href="846%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">846 Squadron</a> on board "Trumpeter" and <a href="852%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">852 Squadron</a> on "Nabob".

"Tirpitz"s anchorage at Kaafjord was heavily defended. Prior to Operation Tungsten, eleven batteries of anti-aircraft guns, several anti-aircraft warships and a system of smoke generators capable of hiding "Tirpitz" from aircraft were located around the fjord. After the attack, additional radar stations and observation posts were established and the number of smoke generators was increased. "Tirpitz"s air defences were strengthened by fitting her with additional cannons, modifying the guns so they could be used to attack aircraft, and supplying anti-aircraft shells for her main guns. The German Air Force ("<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>") had few fighters stationed at airfields near Kaafjord, and their operations were constrained by a lack of fuel.

The Operation Goodwood attack force sailed on 18 August. The timing of the operation was set to allow the Home Fleet to also protect <a href="Convoy%20JW%2059">Convoy JW 59</a>, which had departed from Scotland on 15 August bound for the Soviet Union. After an uneventful journey north, the attack forces arrived off Norway on 20 August. While the first attack against Kaafjord had been planned to take place on 21 August, weather conditions that day were unsuitable for flying operations, and Moore decided upon a 24-hour postponement. The Germans were first alerted to the presence of the British fleet on 21 August when radio messages from the carriers were detected.

The first strike against Kaafjord was launched on 22 August. While flying conditions were poor due to low cloud, Moore decided to attack that day as some of his ships were starting to run low on fuel and would soon need to move away from Norway to refuel. At 11:00 am a force comprising 32 Barracudas, 24 Corsairs, 11 Fireflies, 9 Hellcats and 8 Seafires was launched from the three fleet carriers. No Avengers were dispatched as the cloudy conditions were unsuitable for the execution of their task. Because few mines were available and the Avengers could not safely land while still carrying these weapons, the mine-dropping element of the plan would fail if the aircraft were unable to locate "Tirpitz" and had to dump their loads into the sea.

As the strike force neared the coast, heavy cloud was sighted covering the hills near Kaafjord. Because the clouds prevented accurate bombing, the Barracudas and Corsairs returned to the carriers without attacking. The Hellcat and Firefly fighters continued on, and approached the fjord below the cloud base. These aircraft achieved surprise, and "Tirpitz" was not obscured by smoke when they arrived over Kaafjord. The Fireflies initiated the attack at 12:49 pm by strafing German anti-aircraft guns on and around "Tirpitz". Two minutes later nine Hellcats attacked the battleship with bombs but did not achieve any hits. As the strike force returned to the carriers it destroyed two of "Tirpitz"s seaplanes in Bukta harbour and badly damaged the submarine <a href="German%20submarine%20U-965">"U-965"</a> at <a href="Hammerfest%20%28town%29">Hammerfest</a>. At <a href="Ing%C3%B8ya">Ingøy</a>, north of Hammerfest, three Hellcats strafed a German radio station. The attack set the station's buildings ablaze and damaged the <a href="Antenna%20%28radio%29">aerials</a>. The eight Seafires made diversionary attacks on the <a href="Banak%2C%20Norway">Banak</a> area and a nearby seaplane base, destroying five German seaplanes. Three British aircraft were lost during the attack on the morning of 22 August; one Hellcat and a Seafire were shot down, and one of the Barracudas was forced to ditch into the sea during its return flight.

After the strike force was recovered, much of the Home Fleet sailed away from the Norwegian coast to refuel. A group comprising "Formidable", "Furious", two cruisers and several destroyers set a course for the two fleet oilers, and the escort carrier group withdrew so that the carriers could refuel their escorts. At 5:25 pm, "Nabob" was struck by a torpedo fired from <a href="German%20submarine%20U-354">"U-354"</a>. The carrier suffered serious damage and 21 fatalities but was able to continue limited flight operations. Shortly afterwards "U-354" torpedoed the frigate as the latter searched for "Nabob"s attacker. "Nabob" was forced to return to the Home Fleet's base at <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a> that evening, escorted by "Trumpeter", a cruiser and several destroyers. "Formidable" and "Furious" covered their withdrawal; during this period "Furious" also refuelled from the Home Fleet's tankers. The departure of both escort carriers meant that the mine-dropping component of Operation Goodwood had to be cancelled. "Bickerton"s stern was wrecked by the torpedo, and she could have potentially been salvaged. However, the force's commander did not want to have to protect two crippled ships, and the frigate was <a href="Scuttling">scuttled</a> at around 8:30 pm on 22 August. Shortly after the attacks on "Nabob" and "Bickerton", Seafires from 894 Naval Air Squadron shot down two German <a href="Blohm%20%26amp%3B%20Voss%20BV%20138">Blohm & Voss BV 138</a> reconnaissance aircraft.

During the evening of 22 August, a force of eight Fireflies and six bomb-armed Hellcats from "Indefatigable" raided Kaafjord again. This was the first in what was intended to be a series of small harassing attacks conducted to wear down the German defences. German forces did not detect the aircraft before they arrived over Kaafjord at 7:10 pm, and the Fireflies' strafing attacks on German gun positions killed one member of "Tirpitz"s crew and wounded ten. However, the Hellcats' bombs failed to inflict any damage on the battleship. The British fighters also attacked German ships and radar stations on their return flight, damaging two tankers, a supply ship and a patrol boat. No British aircraft were lost during this raid.

Fog cancelled "Indefatigable"s flying operations on 23 August, including a planned diversionary attack against German shipping in <a href="Langfjorden%20%28Alta%29">Langfjord</a>. The other two carriers and their escorts rejoined Moore and "Indefatigable" off Norway during the morning of 24 August. While conditions that day were initially foggy, the weather cleared enough in the afternoon to permit a strike against Kaafjord. The attacking force comprised 33 Barracudas carrying <a href="armor-piercing%20shot%20and%20shell">armour-piecing</a> bombs, 24 Corsairs (including 5 armed with a 1,000-pound [450 kg] bomb), 10 Hellcats, 10 Fireflies and 8 Seafires. In an attempt to achieve surprise, the aircraft flew off from the carriers from a point further to the south of those used in previous raids. The strike aircraft then flew parallel to the coast, before making landfall and approaching Kaafjord from the south. A German radar station detected the force at 3:41 pm, and immediately alerted "Tirpitz".
The British attack began at 4:00 pm. It was initiated with attacks on German gun positions by the Hellcats and Fireflies, which were flying five minutes ahead of the Barracudas and Corsairs. "Tirpitz"s protective smokescreen was not fully in place at the start of the raid, but by the time the Barracudas and Corsairs arrived she was completely covered by smoke. As a result, these aircraft had to blind bomb the ship, releasing their weapons from altitudes between . Only two bombs hit "Tirpitz". The first was a weapon dropped by a Hellcat that exploded on the roof of her "Bruno" main <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>. The explosion destroyed the quadruple anti-aircraft gun mount located on top of the turret, but did not cause any significant damage to the turret itself. The second bomb to strike the ship was a armour-piercing weapon which penetrated through five decks, killed a sailor in a radio room and lodged near an electrical switch room. This bomb failed to explode, and German bomb disposal experts later determined that it had been only partially filled with explosives. The German report on the attack judged that if the bomb had gone off it would have caused "immeasurable" damage. British fighters also attacked other German ships and facilities in the Kaafjord area, damaging two patrol boats, a <a href="minesweeper">minesweeper</a> and a radar station, as well as destroying an <a href="ammunition%20dump">ammunition dump</a> and three guns of an anti-aircraft battery. "Tirpitz"s last remaining <a href="Arado%20Ar%20196">Arado Ar 196</a> seaplane was attacked in Bukta harbour and damaged beyond repair. Four Corsairs and two Hellcats were shot down during the raid, and the battleship's crew suffered 8 fatalities and 18 men wounded. Casualties among the anti-aircraft units stationed around Kaafjord were heavy.

At 7:30 pm on 24 August, a pair of Fireflies conducted a photo-reconnaissance sortie over Kaafjord to gather intelligence on the results of the attack; their presence caused the Germans to generate a smoke screen over the fjord and fire an intensive anti-aircraft barrage. In a separate action that day, "U-354" was sunk off <a href="Bear%20Island%20%28Norway%29">Bear Island</a> by <a href="Fairey%20Swordfish">Fairey Swordfish</a> operating from the escort carrier which was escorting Convoy JW59.

The German command at Kaafjord judged that the attacks on 24 August had been "undoubtedly the heaviest and most determined so far", and requested that fighter units be transferred from northern Finland to bolster the area's defences. Due to the other demands on Germany's fighter force at this time, the request was turned down on 26 August by the "Luftwaffe"s headquarters.

Gales and fog prevented the British from conducting further attacks between 25 and 28 August. On 25 August "Indefatigable", "Formidable", two cruisers and seven destroyers refuelled from the oilers. Both of the cruisers later detached from the force and returned to Scapa Flow. "Duke of York", "Furious", a cruiser and five destroyers also sailed to the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a> to load supplies. Before leaving the fleet, "Furious" transferred two Barracudas and a pair of Hellcats to "Indefatigable". As the elderly "Furious" was judged to be no longer capable of combat operations, she proceeded from the Faroe Islands to Scapa Flow with the cruiser and several destroyers. On 29 August "Duke of York" and the remaining destroyers rejoined the main body of the Home Fleet off north Norway. During this period, the flying squadrons' maintenance personnel worked to repair aircraft which had been damaged during the 24 August attacks.

Convoy JW59 completed its journey on 25 August, with most of its ships docking at <a href="Kola%2C%20Russia">Kola</a> in northern Russia. The convoy had been repeatedly attacked by U-boats from 20 to 24 August, and its escorting warships and aircraft sank two submarines. All of the merchant vessels arrived safely, with the only Allied loss being the sloop which was torpedoed and sunk by <a href="German%20submarine%20U-344">"U-344"</a> on 21 August.

The final attack of Operation Goodwood was made on 29 August. The strike force comprised 26 Barracudas, 17 Corsairs (of which 2 were armed with 1,000-pound [450 kg] bombs), 10 Fireflies and 7 Hellcats. Seven Seafires also conducted a diversionary raid on Hammerfest. In an attempt to give the bombers accurate aiming points once the artificial smokescreen was generated around "Tirpitz", four of the Hellcats were armed with <a href="target%20indicator">target indicator</a> bombs. The aircraft began launching at 3:30 pm.

The British aircraft failed to achieve surprise. German radar stations had been tracking the Home Fleet's routine anti-submarine and fighter patrols, and the Seafires were detected at 4:40 pm when they were from Kaafjord. In response to this report, the smoke generators around Kaafjord were activated and the fjord's defenders went to their battle positions. The arrival of the main body of British aircraft over Kaafjord was delayed by stronger than expected winds and a navigational error, and they did not reach the target area until 5:25 pm. By this time "Tirpitz" was covered in a very thick smokescreen, and none of the British airmen sighted the ship. The Barracudas and Corsairs were forced to blind-bomb Kaafjord, and while no hits were achieved on the battleship, six members of her crew were wounded by bomb fragments from near misses. German ships and gun positions were once again strafed by the fighters, but no significant damage was inflicted. Heavy anti-aircraft gunfire from "Tirpitz," which was directed by a party of observers stationed on a mountain near Kaafjord, shot down a Corsair and a Firefly.

Following the raid on 29 August, the Home Fleet sailed west to cover <a href="Convoy%20RA59A">Convoy RA59A</a> which had sailed from northern Russia on 28 August bound from the UK. Due to fuel shortages, "Indefatigable" and three destroyers detached later that day to return to Scapa Flow and "Formidable" with two destroyers followed 24 hours later. "Duke of York" and six destroyers remained on station in the Arctic Sea until 11:00 am on 1 September when the convoy was judged to be safe from attack.

Overall, Fleet Air Arm casualties during Operation Goodwood were 40 airmen killed and 17 aircraft destroyed. "Nabob" was also judged to be beyond economical repair, and was withdrawn from service. On the German side, "Tirpitz" suffered only superficial damage.

Following the 29 August raid, the British learned from <a href="Ultra">Ultra</a> signals intelligence that "Tirpitz" had not sustained any significant damage during Operation Goodwood. In public statements the Royal Navy claimed to have damaged or sunk 19 German warships during the attacks on Kaafjord, but did not report damage to "Tirpitz".

During the final days of Operation Goodwood Royal Navy planners decided not to order further Fleet Air Arm operations against Kaafjord. The planners accepted that the Germans were now able to cover "Tirpitz" in smoke before Barracudas could reach the battleship, and these aircraft could not carry bombs large enough to inflict heavy damage. Further consideration was given to attacking Kaafjord using Mosquitos launched from aircraft carriers, but the light bombers continued to be in short supply and it was judged that they were not well suited to the task. Moreover, there was a growing need to transfer the carriers to the Pacific to strengthen Britain's contribution to the <a href="Pacific%20War">war against Japan</a>.

As "Tirpitz" was still considered a threat to shipping, the British <a href="Chiefs%20of%20Staff%20Committee">Chiefs of Staff Committee</a> and the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force General <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> decided in late August to conduct further attacks against her using Royal Air Force heavy bombers. On 15 September, a force of <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a>s <a href="Operation%20Paravane">attacked Kaafjord</a> after refuelling at bases in northern Russia and inflicted irreparable damage on the battleship. Following this raid she sailed to an anchorage near <a href="Troms%C3%B8">Tromsø</a> to be used as an immobile coastal defence battery. <a href="Operation%20Obviate">Another heavy bomber attack</a> on 29 October caused only minor damage, but in a <a href="Operation%20Catechism">third raid</a> mounted on 12 November, "Tirpitz" was struck by several <a href="Tallboy%20bomb">Tallboy bomb</a>s and capsized, sinking with heavy loss of life.

Historians have judged Operation Goodwood to have been a failure. Writing in 1961, the British official historian <a href="Stephen%20Roskill">Stephen Roskill</a> stated that the attacks marked the end of a "series of operations whose results can only be classed as intensely disappointing", and concluded that the possibility of sinking "Tirpitz" had been "remote" due to the shortcomings of the Barracudas and their armament. Similarly, <a href="Norman%20Polmar">Norman Polmar</a> argued in 1969 that Operation Goodwood was "perhaps the most striking failure of the F.A.A. [Fleet Air Arm] during World War II and can be directly attributed to the lack of effective aircraft – the Barracudas were too slow and could not carry large enough bombs to make effective attacks". More recently, Mark Llewellyn Evans judged the results of Operation Goodwood to have been "pathetic", and Mark Bishop concluded that "the Fleet Air Arm's greatest operation of the war ... ended in failure".

Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman

Timothy Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman (March 18, 1845 – February 27, 1863) was an American <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> soldier of <a href="Native%20Hawaiians">Native Hawaiian</a> descent. Considered one of the "Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War", he was among a group of more than one hundred documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants who fought in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> while the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii">Kingdom of Hawaiʻi</a> was still an independent nation.

Born and raised in <a href="Hilo%2C%20Hawaii">Hilo, Hawaiʻi</a>, he was the eldest son of <a href="Kinooleoliliha">Kinoʻoleoliliha</a>, a Hawaiian <a href="Ali%CA%BBi">high chiefess</a>, and <a href="Benjamin%20Pitman%20%28Hawaii%29">Benjamin Pitman</a>, an American pioneer settler from <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>. Through his father's business success in the <a href="Whaling%20in%20the%20United%20States">whaling</a> and sugar and coffee plantation industries and his mother's familial connections to the <a href="House%20of%20Kamehameha">Hawaiian royal family</a>, the Pitmans were quite prosperous and owned lands on the <a href="Hawaii%20%28island%29">island of Hawaiʻi</a> and in <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>. He and his older sister Mary were educated in the <a href="List%20of%20missionaries%20to%20Hawaii">mission</a> schools in Hilo alongside other children of mixed Hawaiian descent. After the death of his mother in 1855, his father remarried to the widow of a missionary, thus connecting the family to the American missionary community in Hawaiʻi. However, following the deaths of his first wife and later his second wife, his father decided to leave the islands and returned to Massachusetts with his family in 1861. The younger Pitman continued his education in the public schools of <a href="Roxbury%2C%20Boston">Roxbury</a>, where the Pitman family lived for a period of time.

Leaving school without his family's knowledge, he made the decision to fight in the Civil War in August 1862. Despite his mixed-race ancestry, Pitman avoided the racial segregation imposed on other Native Hawaiian recruits of the time and enlisted in the <a href="22nd%20Regiment%20Massachusetts%20Volunteer%20Infantry">22nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry</a>, a white regiment. He served as a <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a> in the Union Army fighting in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a> and the <a href="Maryland%20Campaign">Maryland Campaign</a>. In his company, Private <a href="Robert%20G.%20Carter">Robert G. Carter</a> befriended the part-Hawaiian soldier and wrote in later life of their common experience in the 22nd Massachusetts. Compiled decades afterward from old letters, Carter's account described the details surrounding his final fate in the war. On the march to <a href="Battle%20of%20Fredericksburg">Fredericksburg</a>, Pitman was separated from his regiment and captured by <a href="Guerrilla%20warfare%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Confederate guerrilla</a> forces. He was forced to march to <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a> and incarcerated in the Confederate <a href="Libby%20Prison">Libby Prison</a>, where he contracted "lung fever" from the harsh conditions of his imprisonment and died on February 27, 1863, a few months after his release on parole in a prisoner exchange. Modern historians consider Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman to be the only known Hawaiian or <a href="Pacific%20Islander">Pacific Islander</a> to die as a <a href="American%20Civil%20War%20prison%20camps">prisoner of war</a> in the Civil War.

For a period of time after the end of the war, the legacy and contributions of Pitman and other documented Hawaiian participants in the American Civil War were largely forgotten except in the private circles of descendants and historians. However, there has been a revival of interest in recent years in the Hawaiian community. In 2010, these "Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War" were commemorated with a bronze plaque erected along the memorial pathway at the <a href="National%20Memorial%20Cemetery%20of%20the%20Pacific">National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific</a> in Honolulu.

Timothy Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman was born March 18, 1845, in <a href="Hilo%2C%20Hawaii">Hilo, Hawaiʻi</a>, the first son and second child of <a href="Benjamin%20Pitman%20%28Hawaii%29">Benjamin Pitman</a> and <a href="Kinooleoliliha">Kinoʻoleoliliha</a>. Originally a native of <a href="Salem%2C%20Massachusetts">Salem, Massachusetts</a>, Pitman's father was an early pioneer, businessman and sugar and coffee plantation owner on the island of <a href="Hawaii%20%28island%29">Hawaiʻi</a>, who profited greatly from the kingdom's booming whaling industry in the early 1800s. On his father's side, he was a great-grandson of Joshua Pitman (1755–1822), an English-American carpenter on the ship "<a href="USS%20Franklin%20%281775%29">Franklin</a>" under Captain Allen Hallett during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>. On his mother's side, Pitman was a descendant of <a href="Kame%CA%BBeiamoku">Kameʻeiamoku</a>, one of the royal twins (with <a href="Kamanawa">Kamanawa</a>) who advised <a href="Kamehameha%20I">Kamehameha I</a> in his <a href="Unification%20of%20Hawaii">conquest</a> of the <a href="Hawaiian%20Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a>, and also of the early American or English sea captain Harold Cox, who lent his name to <a href="Keeaumoku%20II">George "Cox" Kahekili Keʻeaumoku II</a>, the <a href="Governor%20of%20Maui">Governor of Maui</a>. Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman shared his <a href="Hawaiian%20name">Hawaiian name</a> with his maternal grandfather <a href="Hoolulu">Hoʻolulu</a> who, along with his brother <a href="Hoapili">Hoapili</a>, helped <a href="Kamehameha%20I%23Final%20resting%20place">conceal the bones</a> of King Kamehameha I in a secret hiding place after his death. In the <a href="Hawaiian%20language">Hawaiian language</a>, the name "Hoʻolulu" means "to lie in the sheltered waters". His siblings were <a href="Mary%20Pitman%20Ailau">Mary Pitman Ailau</a> (1838–1905), <a href="Benjamin%20Keolaokalani%20Pitman">Benjamin Franklin Keolaokalani Pitman</a> (1852–1918) and half-sister Maria Kinoʻole Pitman Morey (1858–1892).

Because of his father's success in business and his mother's descent from Hawaiian royalty, the Pitman family was considered quite prosperous and were host to the royal family when they visited Hilo. Besides being one of the leading merchants in town, his father also served the government as district magistrate of Hilo. Henry's mother, Kinoʻole, had inherited control over much of the lands in Hilo and Ōlaʻa from her own father, and King <a href="Kamehameha%20III">Kamehameha III</a> had granted her use of the "<a href="ahupuaa">ahupuaʻa</a>" of Hilo after her marriage. During Henry's early childhood, the family lived in the mansion that Benjamin Pitman had built in 1840, in an area known as Niopola, one of the favored resort spots of <a href="ancient%20Hawaii">ancient Hawaii</a>an royalty. The residence also became known as the Spencer House after Pitman sold it to his business partner Captain Thomas Spencer. The property later became the site of the Hilo Hotel, built in 1888 and torn down in 1956. In the 1850s the family moved to the capital of <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a> where Benjamin Pitman took up banking and built a beautiful two-story house that he named Waialeale ("rippling water") at the corner of Alakea and Beretania Streets.

While in Hawaiʻi, Pitman and his older sister Mary attended Mrs. Wetmore's children's school in Hilo. The school was located at the Wetmores' residence on Church Street. Taught by Lucy Sheldon Taylor Wetmore, the wife of American missionary doctor and government physician Charles Hinckley Wetmore, who had come to Hawaii in 1848 with the <a href="American%20Board%20of%20Commissioners%20for%20Foreign%20Missions">American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions</a> (ABCFM), the two elder Pitman children received their education in English rather than Hawaiian. This was unusual since Hawaiian was the official language of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, and all other schools in Hilo were conducted in the Hawaiian language. Mrs. Wetmore taught the children reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic and singing, while also reinforcing the curriculum with a strong adherence to the principles of the <a href="Protestantism">Protestant faith</a>. Like the Pitman siblings, many of their classmates were also of half-Hawaiian ("hapa-kanaka") descent with a majority of them being <a href="Chinese%20immigration%20to%20Hawaii">Chinese-Hawaiians</a> ("hapa-pake").

After the death of his mother Kinoʻole in 1855, Pitman's father remarried to Maria Louisa Walsworth Kinney, the widow of American missionary Rev. Henry Kinney. The Kinneys were part of the <a href="List%20of%20missionaries%20to%20Hawaii%23Protestant">Twelfth Company of missionaries</a> from the ABCFM to arrive in 1848. The marriage aligned the Pitman children with the American missionary community. They were called "cousins" by the children of the missionaries and considered part of the extended missionary family of Hawaiʻi. This first stepmother died in 1858 after giving birth to their father's fourth child, a daughter named Maria Kinoʻole (1858–1892). The Pitman family returned to Massachusetts in 1861 after his father remarried to his third wife Martha Ball, giving his four children another stepmother. Letters by British traveler Sophia Cracroft, niece of Lady <a href="Jane%20Franklin">Jane Franklin</a>, indicated that the Pitman family left for San Francisco, on June 25, 1861, aboard the ship "Comet" with Cracroft and Lady Franklin and that the elder Pitman "now has a third wife with a baby [Charles Brook Pitman]." According to an 1887 biography written by <a href="Robert%20G.%20Carter">Robert G. Carter</a>, a private who would later serve in the same company as Pitman, he was neglected after his mother's death by his father and stepmother, who "subjected [him] to neglect and treatment, that with his sensitive nature he could not bear". He continued his education in the public schools of <a href="Roxbury%2C%20Boston">Roxbury</a>, where the Pitman family lived for a period of time. He have proceeded the family in leaving Hawaii. The <a href="1860%20United%20States%20Census">1860 United States Census</a> registered Pitman under his teacher Solomon Adams as residing and presumably being educated in <a href="Newton%2C%20Massachusetts">Newton</a>, also in the Boston area.

Growing into adolescence, he was said to strongly resemble his Hawaiian mother. His enlistment card during the war noted he had a dark complexion, hazel colored eyes, black hair and stood five feet eight inches. Robert G. Carter gave a brief description of his appearance in wartime letters first published in 1897:
[A] tall, slim boy, straight as an arrow. His face was a perfect oval, his hair was as black as a raven's wing, and his eyes were large and of that peculiar soft, melting blackness, which excites pity when one is in distress. His skin was a clear, dark olive, bordering on the swarthy, and this, with his high cheek bones, would have led us to suppose that his nationality was different from our own, had we not known that his name was plain Henry P. There was an air of good breeding and refinement about him, that, with his small hands and feet, would have set us to thinking, had it not been that in our youth and intensely enthusiastic natures, we gave no thought to our comrades' personal appearance. We can look back now and see the shy, reserved nature of the boy, the dark, melancholy eyes, the sad smile, the sensitive twitching of the lips.

After the outbreak of the American Civil War, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii">Kingdom of Hawaiʻi</a> under King <a href="Kamehameha%20IV">Kamehameha IV</a> declared its neutrality on August 26, 1861. But many <a href="Native%20Hawaiian">Native Hawaiian</a>s and Hawaiian-born Americans (mainly descendants of the American missionaries), both abroad and in the islands, volunteered and enlisted in the military regiments of various states in the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> and the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>. Individual Native Hawaiians had been serving in the United States Navy and Army since the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, and even more served during the Civil War. Many Hawaiians sympathized with the Union because of Hawaiʻi's ties to <a href="New%20England">New England</a> through its missionaries and the whaling industry, and the ideological opposition of many to the institution of <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a>.

On August 14, 1862, Pitman left school without his family's knowledge and volunteered to serve in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> and fight in the Civil War. He apparently never informed his family in advance about the choice to join the war, because the news of his enlistment was reported back in Hawaiʻi's American missionary community as "Henry Pitman has run away from home and gone [to war]." Carter described Pitman's rationale for enlisting: "In the midst of the clamor of war, when the very air vibrated with excitement, the wild enthusiasm of the crowds, and the inspiring sound of the drum, his <a href="wikt%3AIndian%23Noun">Indian</a> nature rose within him. His resolve was made."

Pitman was a "<a href="Hapa">hapa-haole</a>", of part Hawaiian and part Caucasian descent. His father was white and his native-born mother was also part Caucasian from her own mother, who was the daughter of Captain Cox and a Hawaiian chiefess. Despite his mixed-race ancestry, Pitman avoided the racial segregation imposed on other Native Hawaiian volunteers in this period. Most Native Hawaiians who participated in the war were assigned to <a href="United%20States%20Colored%20Troops">colored regiments</a>, but Pitman's fair skin color meant he was able to serve in a white unit, indicating that unit assignment may have been influenced by how dark Hawaiians appeared. Historians Bob Dye, <a href="James%20L.%20Haley">James L. Haley</a> and others claimed Pitman was placed in the colored regiments because of his mixed race, but regiment records indicate otherwise.

Pitman served as a private in the <a href="22nd%20Regiment%20Massachusetts%20Volunteer%20Infantry">22nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry</a>, Company H. This regiment was also named the "Henry Wilson's Regiment" after Colonel and U.S. Senator <a href="Henry%20Wilson">Henry Wilson</a>, who commanded the unit in 1861. Colonel <a href="William%20S.%20Tilton">William S. Tilton</a> was the regimental commander during Pitman's brief term of service. The regiment was part of the <a href="V%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">V Corps</a> of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a> under the senior command of <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan">George B. McClellan</a>. During this period, the regiment fought in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Second Battle of Bull Run</a> and was involved in the <a href="Maryland%20Campaign">Maryland Campaign</a> fighting in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a>, the bloodiest single-day battle in American history, and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shepherdstown">Battle of Shepherdstown</a>. His regiment was on the march to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fredericksburg">Battle of Fredericksburg</a> when Pitman was captured by Confederate troops.

The most detailed account of Pitman's final fate in the war came from Robert G. Carter. In November 1862, Pitman was captured near <a href="Warrenton%2C%20Virginia">Warrenton Junction</a> on the march toward <a href="Fredericksburg%2C%20Virginia">Fredericksburg, Virginia</a>, during the weeks prior to the Battle of Fredericksburg. He had fallen behind the group because his feet had blistered and swollen due to the tightness of "a pair of thin, high-heeled and narrow soled boots" he had purchased. One of his comrades temporarily stayed behind to care for him but later decided to move on with the rest of the camp for fear of disciplinary consequences of falling out without authority. He was urged to move on, but without much success. Pitman's last words to his comrade were, "I will be in camp by night, good by." His fellow soldiers never saw him again and considered him missing. Shortly after he was left, a band of Confederate guerrillas under Colonel <a href="John%20S.%20Mosby">John S. Mosby</a> captured the weary and defenseless soldier without a struggle. The inscription on his tombstone differs slightly from Carter's account, stating he was captured by <a href="J.%20E.%20B.%20Stuart">J. E. B. Stuart</a>'s cavalry instead.

After Pitman's capture, he was marched to <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a> in a weak physical state. He was imprisoned in the Confederate <a href="Libby%20Prison">Libby Prison</a> and <a href="Belle%20Isle%20%28Richmond%2C%20Virginia%29">Belle Isle</a>, which were notoriously harsh prisons. Pitman's letters home described his place of incarceration as the "Pen" where "the filthy meat [was] thrown to them as if they were dogs". The condition of his incarceration including the shortage of food, lack of sanitation, overcrowding and his physical weakness made him susceptible to virulent diseases present in the Confederate prisons. Carter described how the prisons "wore out the brave spirit". During a prisoner exchange, Pitman was released by the Confederate Army at <a href="City%20Point%2C%20Virginia">City Point, Virginia</a>, on December 12, 1862, and then sent to <a href="Camp%20Parole%2C%20Annapolis">Camp Parole</a>, <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis</a>. Suffering from complications due to the conditions of his imprisonment, he contracted "lung fever", which was perhaps <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. Carter wrote later how his friend had "linger[ed] feebly a few weeks, like the flickering of an expiring flame, then quietly pass[ed] away to an eternal life". Pitman died at Camp Parole on February 27, 1863, just weeks short of his eighteenth birthday. According to historians Anita Manning and Justin Vance, Pitman "has the unfortunate distinction of being the only known Hawaiian or <a href="Pacific%20Islander">Pacific Islander</a> to die as a prisoner of war in the Civil War".

Considering him missing, Pitman's regiment did not discover his final fate until news of his funeral at Roxbury was received in the spring of the following year. His remains were returned to his family in Massachusetts after his death in Camp Parole. Benjamin Pitman, his father, had him buried in a family plot in <a href="Mount%20Auburn%20Cemetery">Mount Auburn Cemetery</a>. On one side of the Pitman family grave marker was placed the inscription:
Timothy Henry PitmanBorn at Hilo, HawaiiMar. 18, 1845Died at Camp ParoleAnnapolis, MD, Feb'y 27, 1863Aged 17 years 11 mos. 9 days"A member of Co. H, 22nd RegimentMass. Vols., was with his Regiment in thebattles of South Mountain, Antietam and Sharpsburg. Was taken prisoner by Stuart'scavalry on the march to Fredricksburg;Imprisoned in Libby Prison, paroled andsent to Camp Parole, Annapolis, and died incamp of pneumonia."

After his death, the memory of Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman was honored by friends and family members back in Massachusetts and Hawaiʻi. During a return to Hawaiʻi in 1917, his younger brother Benjamin Keolaokalani Pitman and his wife Almira Hollander Pitman discovered a grandson of a nephew was named Kealiʻi i Kaua i Pakoma (meaning "Chief that fought the Potomac") in honor of his deceased older brother. Similarly, Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman Beckley, the second son of his Hawaiian first cousin George Charles Moʻoheau Beckley, a grandson of Captain <a href="George%20Charles%20Beckley">George Charles Beckley</a>, was also named after him. Shortly after his death, Pitman was eulogized back in Hawaiʻi by Martha Ann Chamberlain, Corresponding Secretary of the Hawaiian Mission Children's Society:
Our cousin, Henry Pitman, the first of Hawaii's sons to fall in the war, died at Annapolis Parole Camp, Feb. 27, of lung fever, serving as a soldier in the Union army. His remains were deposited in Mt. Auburn Cemetery, near Boston, Mass. He died in a just cause. Let his memory be embalmed among our band.
After the war, the military service of Hawaiians, including Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman, were largely forgotten, disappearing from the collective memories of the American Civil War and the history of Hawaiʻi. However, in recent years, Hawaiian residents and historians and descendants of Hawaiian combatants in the conflict have insisted on the need to remember "our boys from Hawaii". Renewed interest in the stories of these individuals and this particular period of Hawaiian-American history have inspired efforts to preserve the memories of the Hawaiians who served in the war. On August 26, 2010, on the anniversary of the signing of the Hawaiian Neutrality Proclamation, a bronze plaque was erected along the memorial pathway at the <a href="National%20Memorial%20Cemetery%20of%20the%20Pacific">National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific</a> in Honolulu recognizing these "Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War", the more than one hundred documented Hawaiians who served during the American Civil War for both the Union and the Confederacy. Pitman's great-grandniece Diane Kinoʻole o Liliha Pitman Spieler attended the ceremony. Pitman Spieler stated, "I'm very proud of a young man of his age – he was quite young – who served in the Civil War for his family."

In 2013, Todd Ocvirk, Nanette Napoleon, Justin Vance, Anita Manning and others began the process of creating a historical documentary film about the individual experiences and stories of Hawaii-born soldiers and sailors of the Civil War, including Pitman, <a href="Samuel%20C.%20Armstrong">Samuel C. Armstrong</a>, <a href="Nathaniel%20Bright%20Emerson">Nathaniel Bright Emerson</a>, <a href="James%20Wood%20Bush">James Wood Bush</a>, <a href="J.%20R.%20Kealoha">J. R. Kealoha</a> and many other unnamed combatants of both the Union and the Confederacy. In 2014, <a href="Maui">Maui</a>-based author Wayne Moniz wrote a fictionalized story based on the lives and Civil War service of Hawaiian soldiers like Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman in his book "Pukoko: A Hawaiian in the American Civil War". In 2015, the sesquicentennial of the end of the war, the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> released a publication titled "Asians and Pacific Islanders and the Civil War" about the service of the large number of combatants of Asian and Pacific Islander descent who fought during the war. The history of Hawaiʻi's involvement and the biographies of Pitman, Bush, Kealoha and others were co-written by historians Anita Manning and Justin Vance.

AI Mk. IV radar

Airborne Interception radar, Mark IV, or AI Mk. IV for short, was the world's first operational <a href="Airborne%20Interception%20radar">air-to-air radar system</a>. Early Mk. III units appeared in July 1940 on converted <a href="Bristol%20Blenheim">Bristol Blenheim</a> <a href="light%20bomber">light bomber</a>s, while the definitive Mk. IV reached widespread availability on the <a href="Bristol%20Beaufighter">Bristol Beaufighter</a> <a href="heavy%20fighter">heavy fighter</a> by early 1941. On the Beaufighter, the Mk. IV arguably played a role in ending <a href="the%20Blitz">the Blitz</a>, the "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>'s" night bombing campaign of late 1940 and early 1941.

Early development was prompted by a 1936 memo of <a href="Henry%20Tizard">Henry Tizard</a> on the topic of night fighting. The memo was sent to <a href="Robert%20Watson-Watt">Robert Watt</a>, director of the radar research efforts, who agreed to allow physicist <a href="Edward%20George%20Bowen">Edward George "Taffy" Bowen</a> to form a team to study the problem of air interception. The team had a <a href="test%20bed">test bed</a> system in flights later that year, but progress was delayed for four years by emergency relocations, three abandoned production designs, and Bowen's increasingly adversarial relationship with Watt's replacement, <a href="Albert%20Percival%20Rowe">Albert Percival Rowe</a>. Ultimately, Bowen was forced from the team just as the system was finally maturing.

The Mk. IV series operated at a frequency of about 193 <a href="Hertz">megahertz</a> (MHz) with a <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> of 1.5 metres, and offered detection ranges against large aircraft up to . It had numerous operational limitations, including a maximum range that increased with the aircraft's <a href="altitude">altitude</a> and a minimum range that was barely close enough to allow the pilot to see the target. Considerable skill was required of the radar operator to interpret the displays of its two <a href="cathode%20ray%20tubes">cathode ray tubes</a> (CRTs) for the pilot. It was only with the increasing proficiency of the crews, along with the installation of new ground-based radar systems dedicated to the interception task, that interception rates began to increase. These roughly doubled every month through the spring of 1941, during the height of The Blitz.

The Mk. IV was used in the front lines for only a short period. The introduction of the <a href="cavity%20magnetron">cavity magnetron</a> in 1940 led to rapid progress in <a href="microwave">microwave</a>-frequency radars, which offered far greater accuracy and were effective at low altitudes. The prototype Mk. VII began to replace the Mk. IV at the end of 1941, and the <a href="AI%20Mk.%20VIII%20radar">AI Mk. VIII</a> largely relegated the Mk. IV to second-line duties by 1943. The Mk. IV's receiver, originally a <a href="television">television</a> receiver, was used as the basis of the <a href="ASV%20Mk.%20II%20radar">ASV Mk. II radar</a>, <a href="Chain%20Home%20Low">Chain Home Low</a>, <a href="AMES%20Type%207">AMES Type 7</a>, and many other radar systems throughout the war.

By late 1935, Robert Watt's development of <a href="Chain%20Home">Chain Home</a> (CH) radar at <a href="Bawdsey%20Manor">Bawdsey Manor</a> in <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a> on the east coast of England had succeeded in building a system able to detect large aircraft at ranges over . On 9 October, Watt wrote a memo calling for the construction of a chain of radar stations running down the east coast of England and Scotland, spaced about apart, providing <a href="early%20warning%20radar">early warning</a> for the entire British Isles. Development continued, and by the end of 1935 the range had improved to over , reducing the number of stations required.

During 1936 the experimental system at Bawdsey was tested against a variety of simulated attacks, along with extensive development of interception theory carried out at <a href="RAF%20Biggin%20Hill">RAF Biggin Hill</a>. One observer was <a href="Hugh%20Dowding">Hugh Dowding</a>, initially as the director of research for the RAF, and later as the commander of <a href="RAF%20Fighter%20Command">RAF Fighter Command</a>. Dowding noted that the CH stations provided so much information that operators had problems relaying it to the pilots, and the pilots had problems understanding it. He addressed this through the creation of what is today known as the <a href="Dowding%20system">Dowding system</a>.

The Dowding system relied on a private telephone network forwarding information from the CH stations, <a href="Royal%20Observer%20Corps">Royal Observer Corps</a> (ROC), and <a href="pipsqueak">pipsqueak</a> <a href="radio%20direction%20finding">radio direction finding</a> (RDF) to a central room where the reports were plotted on a large map. This information was then telephoned to the four regional Group headquarters, who re-created the map covering their area of operations. Details from these maps would then be sent to each Group's Sectors, covering one or two main airbases, and from there to the pilots via radio. This process took time, during which the target aircraft moved. As the CH systems were only accurate to about 1 km at best, subsequent reports were scattered and could not place a target more accurately than about . This was fine for daytime interceptions; the pilots would have normally spotted their targets within this range.

Henry Tizard, whose <a href="Tizard%20Committee">committee</a> spearheaded development of the CH system, grew concerned that CH would be too effective. He expected that the "Luftwaffe" would suffer so many losses that they would be forced to call off daylight attacks, and would turn to a night bombing effort. Their predecessors in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> did the same when the <a href="London%20Air%20Defence%20Area">London Air Defence Area</a> successfully blocked daytime raids, and attempts to intercept German bombers at night proved comically ineffective. Tizard's concerns would prove prophetic; Bowen called it "one of the best examples of technological forecasting made in the twentieth century".

Tizard was aware that tests showed an observer would only be able to see an aircraft at night at a range of about , perhaps under the very best moonlit conditions, an accuracy that the Dowding system could not provide. Adding to the problem would be the loss of information from the ROC, who would not be able to spot the aircraft except under the very best conditions. If the interception was to be handled by radar, it would have to be arranged in the short time between initial detection and the aircraft passing beyond the CH sites on the shoreline.

Tizard put his thoughts in a 27 April 1936 letter to Hugh Dowding, who was at that time the <a href="Air%20Member%20for%20Supply%20and%20Organisation">Air Member for Research and Development</a>. He also sent a copy to Watt, who forwarded it to the researchers who were moving to their new research station at Bawdsey Manor. In a meeting at the Crown and Castle pub, Bowen pressed Watt for permission to form a group to study the possibility of placing a radar on the aircraft itself. This would mean the CH stations would only need to get the fighter into the general area of the bomber, the fighter would be able to use its own radar for the rest of the interception. Watt was eventually convinced that the staffing needed to support development of both CH and a new system was available, and the Airborne Group was spun off from the CH effort in August 1936.

Bowen started the <a href="Airborne%20Interception%20radar">Airborne Interception radar</a> (AI) efforts by discussing the issue with two engineers at nearby <a href="RAF%20Martlesham%20Heath">RAF Martlesham Heath</a>, Fred Roland, and N.E. Rowe. He also made a number of visits to Fighter Command headquarters at <a href="RAF%20Bentley%20Priory">RAF Bentley Priory</a> and discussed night fighting techniques with anyone who proved interested. The first criteria for an airborne radar, operable by either the pilot or an observer, included:

Bowen then started looking for a suitable receiver system, and immediately had a stroke of good luck; <a href="EMI">EMI</a> had recently constructed a prototype receiver for the experimental <a href="BBC">BBC</a> <a href="television">television</a> broadcasts on 6.7 m wavelength (45 MHz). The receiver used seven or eight <a href="vacuum%20tube">vacuum tube</a>s (valves) on a chassis only in height and about long. Combined with a CRT display, the entire system weighed only . Bowen later described it as "far and away better than anything which [had] been achieved in Britain up to that time."

Only one receiver was available, which was moved between aircraft for testing. A transmitter of the required power was not available in portable form. Bowen decided to gain some familiarity with the equipment by building a ground-based transmitter. Placing the transmitter in Bawdsey's Red Tower and the receiver in the White Tower, they found they were able to detect aircraft as far as away.

With the basic concept proven, the team then looked for a suitable aircraft to carry the receiver. Martlesham provided a <a href="Handley%20Page%20Heyford">Handley Page Heyford</a> bomber, a reversal of duties from the original <a href="Robert%20Watson-Watt%23Aircraft%20detection%20and%20location">Daventry Experiment</a> that led to the development of CH in which a Heyford was the target. One reason for the selection of this design was that its <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Kestrel">Rolls-Royce Kestrel</a> engines had a well-shielded ignition system which gave off minimal electrical noise.

Mounting the receiver in the Heyford was not a trivial task; the standard <a href="dipole%20antenna%23Half-wave%20dipole">half-wave dipole antenna</a> needed to be about long to detect wavelengths of 6.7 m. The solution was eventually found by stringing a cable between the Heyford's fixed <a href="landing%20gear">landing gear</a> struts. A series of <a href="dry%20cell">dry cell</a> batteries lining the aircraft floor powered the receiver, providing high voltage for the CRT through an <a href="trembler%20coil">ignition coil</a> taken from a <a href="Ford">Ford</a>.

When the system took to the air for the first time in the autumn of 1936, it immediately detected aircraft flying in the <a href="Airfield%20traffic%20pattern">circuit</a> at Martlesham, away, in spite of the crudity of the installation. Further tests were just as successful, with the range pushed out to .

It was around this time that Watt arranged for a major test of the CH system at Bawdsey with many aircraft involved. Dowding had been promoted to Chief of Fighter Command, and was on hand to watch. Things did not go well; for unknown reasons the radar did not pick up the approaching aircraft until they were far too close to arrange interception. Dowding was watching the screens intently for any sign of the bombers, failing to find one when he heard them pass overhead. Bowen averted total disaster by quickly arranging a demonstration of his system in the Red Tower, which picked out the aircraft as they re-formed away.

The system, then known as RDF 1.5, would require a large number of ground-based transmitters to work in an operational setting. Moreover, good reception was only achieved when the target, interceptor, and transmitter were roughly in a line. Due to these limitations, the basic concept was considered unworkable as an operational system, and all effort moved to designs with both the transmitter and receiver in the interceptor aircraft.

Bowen would later lament this decision in his book "Radar Days", where he noted his feelings about failing to follow up on the RDF 1.5 system:
Another attempt to revive the RDF 1.5 concept, today known more generally as <a href="bistatic%20radar">bistatic radar</a>, was made in March 1940 when a modified set was mounted in <a href="Bristol%20Blenheim">Bristol Blenheim</a> "<a href="United%20Kingdom%20military%20aircraft%20serials">L6622</a>". This set was tuned to the transmissions of the new <a href="Chain%20Home%20Low">Chain Home Low</a> transmitters, dozens of which were being set up along the <a href="Coastline%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">UK coastline</a>. These experiments did not prove successful, with a detection range on the order of , and the concept was abandoned for good.

The team received a number of <a href="Western%20Electric">Western Electric</a> Type 316A large <a href="acorn%20tube">acorn vacuum tubes</a> in early 1937. These were suitable for building transmitter units of about 20 W continual power for wavelengths of 1 to 10 m (300 to 30 MHz). Percy Hibberd built a prototype transmitter with pulses of a few hundred watts and fitted it to the Heyford in March 1937.

In testing the transmitter proved only barely suitable in the air-to-air role, with short detection ranges due to its relatively low power. But to everyone's surprise, it was able to easily pick out the wharves and cranes at the <a href="Harwich%20International%20Port">Harwich docks</a> a few miles south of Bawdsey. Shipping appeared as well, but the team was unable to test this very well as the Heyford was forbidden to fly over water. After this success, Bowen was granted two <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a> <a href="patrol%20aircraft">patrol aircraft</a>, "K6260" and "K8758", along with five pilots stationed at Martlesham to test this ship-detection role. Early tests demonstrated a problem with noise from the <a href="ignition%20system">ignition system</a> interfering with the receiver, but this was soon resolved by fitters at the <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Establishment">Royal Aircraft Establishment</a> (RAE).

Meanwhile, Hibberd had successfully built a new <a href="Push%E2%80%93pull%20output">push–pull amplifier</a> using two of the same tubes but working in the <a href="1.25-meter%20band">1.25-meter band</a>, an upper-<a href="VHF">VHF</a> band (around 220 MHz); below 1.25 m the sensitivity dropped off sharply. Gerald Touch, originally from the <a href="Clarendon%20Laboratory">Clarendon Laboratory</a>, converted the EMI receiver to this wavelength by using the existing set as the <a href="intermediate%20frequency">intermediate frequency</a> (IF) stage of a <a href="superheterodyne%20receiver">superheterodyne circuit</a>. The original 45 MHz frequency would remain the IF setting for many following radar systems. On its first test on 17 August, Anson "K6260" with Touch and Keith Wood aboard immediately detected shipping in the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> at a range of . The team later increased the wavelength slightly to 1.5 m to improve sensitivity of the receiver, and this 200 MHz setting would be common to many radar systems of this era.

After hearing of the success, Watt called the team and asked if they would be available for testing in September, when a combined fleet of <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> ships and <a href="RAF%20Coastal%20Command">RAF Coastal Command</a> aircraft would be carrying out <a href="military%20exercise">military exercise</a>s in the Channel. On the afternoon of 3 September the aircraft successfully detected the battleship , the aircraft carrier and the light cruiser , receiving very strong returns. The next day they took off at dawn and, in almost complete overcast, found "Courageous" and "Southampton" at a distance of . As they approached the ships and eventually became visible, they could see the "Courageous" launching aircraft to intercept them. The promise of the system was not lost on observers; <a href="Albert%20Rowe%20%28physicist%29">Albert Percival Rowe</a> of the <a href="Committee%20for%20the%20Scientific%20Study%20of%20Air%20Defence">Tizard Committee</a> commented that "This, had they known, was the writing on the wall for the German Submarine Service."

Airborne radar for detecting ships at sea came to be known as Air-to-Surface-Vessel (ASV) radar. Its successes led to continued demands for additional tests. Growing interest and increased efforts in ASV contributed to delays in airborne intercept sets; the team spent a considerable time in 1937 and 1938 working on the ASV problem.

In May 1938 A.P. Rowe took over Bawdsey Manor from Watt, who had been appointed Director of Communications Development at the Air Ministry. The remainder of 1938 was taken up with practical problems in the development of ASV. One change was the use of the new Western Electric 4304 tubes in place of the earlier 316As. These allowed a further increase in power to pulses around 2 kW, which provided detection of ships at . Their test target was the <a href="Lightvessels%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Cork Lightship</a>, a small boat anchored about from the White Tower. This performance against such a small vessel was enough to prompt the Army to begin work on what would become the Coast Defence (CD) radars. The Army cell had first been set up on 16 October 1936 to develop the <a href="GL%20Mk.%20I%20radar">Gun Laying radar</a> systems.

Another change was due to every part of the equipment having different power requirements. The tubes for the transmitter used 6 V to heat their filaments, but 4 V was needed for the receiver tubes and 2 V for the filament of the CRT. The CRT also needed 800 V for its electron gun, but the transmitter tubes 1000 V for their modulators (drivers). At first, the team used <a href="motor-generator">motor-generator</a> sets placed in the Anson and Battle fuselages, or batteries connected in various ways as in the earliest sets in the Heyfords. Bowen decided the solution was to build a <a href="power%20supply">power supply</a> that would produce all of these <a href="DC%20voltage">DC voltage</a>s from a single 240 V 50 Hz supply using transformers and rectifiers. This would allow them to power the radar systems using <a href="mains%20power">mains power</a> while the aircraft were on the ground.

British aero engines were normally equipped with a <a href="power%20take%20off">power take-off</a> shaft that led to the rear of the engine. In twin engine aircraft like the Anson, one of these would be used for a <a href="Dynamo">generator</a> that powered the aircraft instruments at 24 V DC, the other would be left unconnected and available for use. Following a suggestion from Watt to avoid Air Ministry channels, in October Bowen flew one of the Battles to the <a href="Metropolitan-Vickers">Metropolitan-Vickers</a> (Metrovick) plant in Sheffield, where he pulled the DC generator off the engine, dropped it on the table, and asked for an AC <a href="alternator">alternator</a> of similar size and shape. <a href="Arnold%20Tustin">Arnold Tustin</a>, Metrovick's lead engineer, was called in to consider the problem, and after a few minutes he returned to say that he could supply an 80 V unit at 1200 to 2400 Hz and 800 W, even better than the 500 W requested. Bowen had an order for 18 pre-production units placed as soon as possible, and the first units started arriving at the end of October. A second order for 400 more quickly followed. Eventually about 133,800 of these alternators would be produced during the war.

To better test the needs of AI, an aircraft with the speed needed to intercept a modern bomber was needed. In October 1938 the team was provided with two <a href="Fairey%20Battle">Fairey Battle</a> <a href="light%20bomber">light bomber</a>s, which had performance and size more suited to the <a href="night%20fighter">night fighter</a> role. Battles "K9207" and "K9208", and the crew to fly them, were sent to Martlesham; "K9208" was selected to carry the radar, while "K9207" was used as a target and support aircraft.

By 1939, it was clear that war was looming, and the team began to turn their primary attention from ASV back to AI. A new set, built by combining the transmitter unit from the latest ASV units with the EMI receiver, first flew in a Battle in May 1939. The system demonstrated a maximum range that was barely adequate, around , but the too-long minimum range proved to be a far greater problem.

The minimum range of any radar system is due to its <a href="Radar%20signal%20characteristics%23pulse%20width">pulse width</a>, the length of time that the transmitter is turned on before it turns off so the receiver can listen for reflections from targets. If the echo from the target is received while the transmitter is still sending, the echo will be swamped by the transmitted pulse backscattering off local sources. For instance, a radar with a pulse width of 1 µs would not be able to see returns from a target less than 150 m away, because the radar signal travelling at the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a> would cover the round trip distance of 300 m before that 1 µs interval had passed.

In the case of ASV this was not a problem; aircraft would not approach a ship on the surface more closely than its altitude of perhaps a few thousand feet, so a longer pulse width was fine. But in the AI role, the minimum range was pre-defined by the pilot's eyesight, at 300 m or less for night interception, which demanded sub-microsecond pulse widths. This proved very difficult to arrange, and ranges under 1,000 feet were difficult to produce.

Gerald Touch invested considerable effort in solving this problem and eventually concluded that a sub-1 µs transmitter pulse was possible. However, when this was attempted it was found that signals would leak through to the receiver and cause it to be blinded for a period, longer than 1 µs. He developed a solution using a <a href="time%20base%20generator">time base generator</a> that both triggered the transmitter pulse as well as cut out the front-end of the receiver, causing it to become far less sensitive during this period. This concept became known as "<a href="squegging">squegging</a>". In extensive tests in Anson "K6260", Touch finally settled on a minimum range of as the best compromise between visibility and sensitivity.

Additionally, the sets demonstrated a serious problem with ground reflections. The broadcast antenna sent out the pulse over a very wide area covering the entire forward side of the aircraft. This meant that some of the broadcast energy struck the ground and reflected back to the receiver. The result was a solid line across the display at a distance equal to the aircraft's altitude, beyond which nothing could be seen. This was fine when the aircraft was flying at or more and the ground return was at about the maximum useful range, but meant that interceptions carried out at lower altitudes offered increasingly shorter range.

In May 1939 the unit was transferred to a Battle, and in mid-June "Stuffy" Dowding was taken on a test flight. Bowen operated the radar and made several approaches from various points. Dowding was impressed, and asked for a demonstration of the minimum range. He instructed Bowen to have the pilot hold position once they had made their closest approach on the radar scope so they could look up and see how close that really was. Bowen relates the outcome:

Dowding's version of the same events differs. He states he was "tremendously impressed" by the potential, but pointed out to Bowen that the 1,000 foot minimum range was a serious handicap. He makes no mention of the close approach, and his wording suggests that it did not take place. Dowding reports that when they met again later in the day, Bowen stated that he had made a sensational advance, and the minimum range had been reduced to only . Dowding reports this uncritically, but the historical record demonstrates no such advance had been made.

On their return to Martlesham, Dowding outlined his concerns about night interceptions and the characteristics of a proper night fighter. Since the interceptions were long affairs, the aircraft needed to have long endurance. To ensure that <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a> was not an issue, pilots would be required to identify all targets visually. This meant a separate radar operator would be needed, so the pilot would not lose his night vision by looking at the CRTs. And finally, since the time needed to arrange an interception was so long, the aircraft required armament that could guarantee destruction of a bomber in a single pass—there was little chance a second interception could be arranged.

Dowding later wrote a memo considering several aircraft for the role, rejecting the <a href="Boulton%20Paul%20Defiant">Boulton Paul Defiant</a> two-seat fighter due to its cramped rear turret area. He was sure the Bristol Beaufighter would be perfect for the role, but it would not be ready for some time. So he selected the Bristol Blenheim light bomber for the immediate term, sending two of the early prototypes to Martlesham Heath to be fitted with the radar from the Battles. Blenheim "K7033" was fitted with the radar, while "K7034" acted as the target. Both of these aircraft lost a propeller in flight but landed safely; "K7033"s propeller was never found, but "K7034"<nowiki>'s was returned to Martlesham the next day by an irate farmer.</nowiki>

Even at the 1.5 m wavelength, antennas of practical size had relatively low gain and very poor resolution; the transmitter antenna created a fan-shaped signal over 90 degrees wide. This was not useful for homing on a target, so some system of direction indication was required. The team seriously considered <a href="Phase-comparison%20monopulse">phase comparison</a> as a solution, but could not find a suitable phase shifting circuit.

Instead, a system of multiple receiver antennas was adopted, each one located so that only a certain section of the sky was visible. Two horizontal receivers were mounted on either side of the fuselage and only saw reflections from the left or right, slightly overlapping in the middle. Two vertical receivers were mounted above and below the wing, seeing reflections above or below the aircraft.

Each pair of antennas was connected to a motorized switch that rapidly switched between the pairs, a technique known as <a href="lobe%20switching">lobe switching</a>. Both signals were then sent to a <a href="cathode%20ray%20tube">cathode ray tube</a> (CRT) for display, with one of them passing through a voltage inverter. If the target was to the left, the display would show a longer blip on the left than the right. When the target was dead ahead, the blips would be equal length. There was an inherently limited accuracy to such a solution, about five degrees but it was a practical solution in terms of limiting the antenna sizes.

By this point the Air Ministry was desperate to get any unit into service. Satisfied with his visit in May, Dowding suggested that the Mk. I was good enough for operational testing purposes. On 11 June 1939, AI was given the highest priority and provisions were made to supply 11 additional Blenheims to <a href="No.%2025%20Squadron%20RAF">No 25 squadron</a> at <a href="RAF%20Hawkinge">RAF Hawkinge</a> (for a total of 21). Since each of the parts came from different suppliers, and the fitters were unfamiliar with any of it, members of the AI team would have to hand-assemble the components as they arrived and instruct the fitters on the sets.

Watt was waiting for the order, and in 1938 had arranged for production of the transmitters at Metrovick and receivers at <a href="A.C.%20Cossor">A.C. Cossor</a>. These turned out to be the wrong products: Metrovick had been told to directly copy ("Chinese") the 1937 design by Percy Hibberd, but Bawdsey had delivered the wrong prototype to Metrovick, who copied it. The Cossor receivers were found to be unusable, weighing as much as the entire transmitter and receiver, and having sensitivity about half that of the EMI lash-up.

It was at this point that the team had yet another stroke of luck. Bowen's former thesis advisor at <a href="King%27s%20College%2C%20London">King's College, London</a>, was <a href="Edward%20Victor%20Appleton">Edward Appleton</a>, who had worked with Watt and <a href="Harold%20John%20Pye">Harold Pye</a> during the 1920s. Pye had since gone on to form his own radio company, <a href="Pye%20Ltd.">Pye Ltd.</a>, and was active in the television field. They had recently introduced a new television set based on an innovative vacuum tube developed by <a href="Philips">Philips</a> of Holland, the <a href="EF50">EF50</a> pentode. Appleton mentioned the Pye design to Bowen, who found it to be a great improvement over the EMI version, and was happy to learn there had been a small production run that could be used for their experiments. The design became widely known as the "Pye strip".

The Pye strip was such an advance on the EMI unit that the EF50 became a key strategic component. As a German invasion of the west loomed in 1940, the British contacted Philips and arranged a plan to remove the company's board of directors to the UK, along with 25,000 more EF50s and another 250,000 bases, onto which <a href="Mullard">Mullard</a>, Philip's UK subsidiary, could build complete tubes. A destroyer, , was dispatched to pick them up in May, and left the Netherlands only days before the German invasion on 15 May 1940. The Pye strip, and its 45 MHz intermediate frequency, would be re-used in many other wartime radar systems.

New Blenheims eventually arrived at Martlesham, these having been experimentally converted to <a href="heavy%20fighter">heavy fighter</a>s with the addition of four <a href=".303%20British">.303 British</a> <a href="M1919%20Browning%20machine%20gun">Browning machine gun</a>s and four <a href="Hispano-Suiza%20HS.404">20mm Hispano autocannon</a>, while removing the mid-upper turret to reduce weight by and drag by a small amount. These arrived without any of the racking or other fittings required to mount the radar, which had to be constructed by local fitters. Further deliveries were not the Blenheim Mk. IF and IIF models originally provided, but the new Mk. IVF versions with a longer and redesigned nose. The gear had to be re-fitted for the new aircraft, and the receivers and CRTs were mounted in the enlarged nose, allowing the operator to indicate corrections to the pilot through hand signals as a backup if the intercom failed.

By September, several Blenheims were equipped with what was now officially known as AI Mk. I and training of the crews began with No. 25 Squadron at <a href="RAF%20Northolt">RAF Northolt</a>. <a href="Robert%20Hanbury%20Brown">Robert Hanbury Brown</a>, a physicist who would later work on radar in the US, and Keith Wood joined them in August 1939, helping fitters keep the systems operational, and coming up with useful methods for interception. Near the end of August, Dowding visited the base and saw the radars in the nose and pointed out to Bowen that the enemy gunners would see the light from the CRTs and shoot the operator. The sets were re-fitted once again, returning to the rear of the fuselage, which caused more delays.

With the units in the rear, the only communications method was via the intercom. Contemporary systems used the radio as the intercom as well, but the TR9D sets used in RAF aircraft used the voice channel for 15 seconds every minute for the <a href="pip-squeak">pip-squeak</a> system, blocking communications. Even when modified sets were supplied that addressed this, the radar was found to interfere strongly with the intercom. A <a href="speaking%20tube">speaking tube</a> was tried but found to be useless. Newer <a href="VHF">VHF</a> radios being developed through this same period did not suffer these problems, and the Blenheims were moved to the front of the queue to receive these units.

Bawdsey, right on the eastern coast in a relatively secluded location, could not effectively be protected from air attack or even bombardment from boats offshore. The need to move the team to a more protected location on the opening of hostilities had been identified long before the war. During a visit to his <a href="alma%20mater">alma mater</a> at <a href="Dundee%20University">Dundee University</a>, Watt approached the rector to ask about potentially basing the team there, on short notice. When the Germans invaded Poland and war was declared on 3 September 1939, the research teams packed up and arrived in Dundee to find the rector only dimly recalling the conversation and having nothing prepared for their arrival. Students and professors had since returned after the summer break, and only two small rooms were available for the entire group.

The AI group and their experimental aircraft of D Flight, <a href="Aeroplane%20and%20Armament%20Experimental%20Establishment">A&AEE</a>, moved to an airport some distance away at <a href="Perth%2C%20Scotland">Perth, Scotland</a>. The airport was completely unsuitable for the fitting work, with only a single small hangar available for aircraft work while a second was used for offices and labs. This required most of the aircraft to remain outside while others were worked on inside. Nevertheless, the initial group of aircraft was completed by October 1939. With this success, more and more aircraft arrived at the airport to have the AI team fit radars, most of these being the ASV units for patrol aircraft like the <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a> and <a href="Short%20Sunderland">Short Sunderland</a>, followed by experimental fittings to <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a> <a href="Fairey%20Swordfish">Fairey Swordfish</a> and <a href="Supermarine%20Walrus">Supermarine Walrus</a>.

<a href="Bernard%20Lovell">Bernard Lovell</a> joined the radar team at the personal suggestion of <a href="Patrick%20Blackett%2C%20Baron%20Blackett">P.M.S. Blackett</a>, an original member of the Tizard Committee. He arrived at Dundee and met Sidney Jefferson, who told him he had been transferred to the AI group. The conditions at Perth were so crude that it was clearly affecting work, and Lovell decided to write to Blackett about it on 14 October. Among many concerns, he noted that;

Blackett removed any direct reference to Lovell and passed it to Tizard, who discussed the issue with Rowe during his next visit to Dundee. Rowe immediately surmised who had written the letter and called Lovell in to discuss it. Lovell thought little of it at the time, but later learned that Rowe had written back to Tizard on 26 October:

Rowe surmised from the conversation that the main problem was that Perth was simply not suitable for the work. He decided that most of the research establishment, now known as the Air Ministry Research Establishment (AMRE), would remain in Dundee while the AI team should be moved to a more suitable location. This time the chosen location was <a href="MOD%20St%20Athan">RAF St Athan</a>, about from <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>. St Athan was a large base that also served as an RAF training ground, and should have been an ideal location.

When the AI team arrived on 5 November 1939, they found themselves being housed in a disused hangar with no office space. A small amount of relief was found by using abandoned Heyford wings as partitions, but this proved largely useless as the weather turned cold. As the main doors of the hangar were normally left open during the day, it was often too cold to hold a screwdriver. Bowen complained that the conditions "would have produced a riot in a prison farm."

Ironically, Bawdsey was ignored by the Germans for the entire war, while St Athan was attacked by a <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2088">Junkers Ju 88</a> only weeks after the team arrived. The single bomb struck the runway directly, but failed to explode.

With October's deliveries, the Air Ministry began plans for a production AI Mk. II. This differed largely by the addition of a new <a href="timebase">timebase</a> system, which it was hoped would reduce the minimum range to a very useful . When the new units were installed, it was found the minimum range had increased to 1000 feet. This problem was traced to unexpectedly high <a href="capacitance">capacitance</a> in the tubes, and with further work they were only able to return to the Mk. I's 800 feet. Blenheims from a number of squadrons were fitted with the Mk. II, with three aircraft each being allotted to No. 23, 25, 29, 219, 600 and 604 Squadrons in May 1940.

Two experimental versions of the Mk. II were tested. The AIH unit used <a href="General%20Electric%20Company%20plc">GEC</a> VT90 Micropup valves in place of the Acorns for additional power, the H standing for high power of about 5 kW. A test unit fitted to a Blenheim IF proved promising in March and a second was delivered in early April but development was ended for unknown reasons. The AIL had a "locking timebase", which improved maximum range, at the cost of a greatly increased minimum range of and work was abandoned.

While aircraft were being delivered, Bowen, Tizard and Watt pressed the Air Ministry to appoint someone to command the entire night fighting system, from ensuring aircraft delivery and radar production to the training of pilots and ground crew. This led to the formation of the Night Interception Committee (so-named in July 1940) under the direction of <a href="Richard%20Peirse">Richard Peirse</a>. Peirse raised the Night Interception Unit at <a href="RAF%20Tangmere">RAF Tangmere</a> on 10 April 1940; it was later renamed the <a href="Fighter%20Interception%20Unit">Fighter Interception Unit</a> (FIU).

Bowen led a series of lectures at Bentley Priory, on the theory of radar guided night interception and concluded that the fighter would require a speed advantage of 20 to 25% over its target. The main "Luftwaffe" bombers—the Junkers Ju 88, <a href="Dornier%20Do%2017">Dornier Do 17</a>Z, and <a href="Heinkel%20He%20111">Heinkel He 111</a>—were capable of flying at about , at least with a medium load. This implied a fighter would need to fly at least and the Blenheim, fully loaded, was capable of only . Bowen's concerns over the poor speed of the Blenheim were proved right in combat.

The Mk. II was used for only a short time when the team replaced its transmitter section with one from the ASV Mk. I, which used the new Micropup valves. The new AI Mk. III sets were experimentally fitted to about twenty Blenheim IFs in April 1940, where they demonstrated an improved maximum range of . However, they still suffered from a long minimum range, from 800 to 1,500 ft depending on how the receiver was adjusted.

This led to what Hanbury Brown describes as "the great minimum range controversy". From October 1939, working around the clock to install the remaining Mk. I sets at Perth and St Athan, the team had had no time for further development of the electronics. They were aware that the minimum range was still greater than was satisfactory but Bowen and Hanbury Brown were convinced there was a simple solution they could implement once the initial installations were completed. Meanwhile, the current sets continued to be installed, although all were aware of their problems. On 24 January 1940 <a href="Arthur%20Tedder%2C%201st%20Baron%20Tedder">Arthur Tedder</a> admitted to Tizard that:

The issue of minimum range continued to be raised, working its way through the Air Ministry and eventually to <a href="Harold%20Lardner">Harold Lardner</a>, head of what was then known as the Stanmore Research Centre. Rowe and his deputy <a href="Bennett%20Lewis">Bennett Lewis</a> were called to meet with Lardner to discuss the issue. Apparently without informing Lardner of Bowen and Hanbury Brown's potential solution, or the fact that they could not work on it due to the ongoing installations, they agreed to have Lewis investigate the matter. Lewis then sent a contract to EMI to see what they could do. According to both Bowen and Hanbury Brown, Rowe and Lewis instigated these events deliberately to pull control of the AI project from the AI team.

At Dundee, Lewis raised the issue and two solutions to improving the range were considered. The Mk. IIIA consisted of a set of minor changes to the transmitter and receiver with the goal of reducing the minimum range to about . Lewis' own solution was the Mk. IIIB, which used a second transmitter that broadcast a signal that mixed with the main one to cancel it out during the end of the pulse. He believed this would reduce the minimum range to only . Two copies of the IIIA entered tests in May 1940 and demonstrated little improvement, with the range reduced to only , but at the cost of significantly reduced maximum range of only . Tests of the IIIB waited while the AI team moved from St Athan to <a href="Worth%20Matravers">Worth Matravers</a> in May, and were eventually overtaken by events. Development of both models was cancelled in June 1940.

Word that Lewis was developing his own solutions to the minimum range problem reached the AI team at St Athan some time in early 1940. Bowen was extremely upset. He had become used to the way the researchers had been put into an ill-advised attempt at production but now Rowe was directly removing them from the research effort as well. Tizard heard of the complaints and visited Dundee in an attempt to smooth them over, which evidently failed. On 29 March 1940 a memo from Watt's DCD office announced a reorganization of the Airborne Group. Gerald Touch would move to the RAE to help develop production, installation and maintenance procedures for the Mk. IV, several other members would disperse to RAF airfields to help train the ground and air crews directly on the units, while the rest of the team, including Lovell and <a href="Alan%20Lloyd%20Hodgkin">Hodgkin</a>, would re-join the main radar research teams in Dundee. Bowen was notably left out of the reorganization; his involvement in AI ended. In late July, Bowen was invited to join the <a href="Tizard%20Mission">Tizard Mission</a>, which left for the US in August 1940.

Mk. III went into extensive testing at No. 25 Sqn in May 1940 and another troubling problem was found. As the target aircraft moved to the sides of the fighter, the error in the horizontal angle grew. Eventually, at about 60 degrees to the side, the target was indicated as being on the other side of the fighter. Hanbury Brown concluded that the problem was due to reflections between the fuselage and engine nacelles, due to the change to the long-nose IVF from the short-nose IF and IIF. In previous examples they had used the fuselage of the aircraft as the reflector, positioning and angling the antennas to run along the nose or wing leading edges.

He tried moving the horizontal antennas to the outside of the nacelles, but this had little effect. Another attempt using vertically oriented antennas "completely cured the problem", and allowed the antennas to be positioned anywhere along the wing. When he later tried to understand why the antennas had always been horizontal, he found this had come from the ASV trials where it was found this reduced reflections from the waves. Given the parallel development of the ASV and AI systems, this arrangement had been copied to the AI side without anyone considering other solutions.

At a meeting of the Night Interception Committee on 2 May it was decided that the bomber threat was greater than submarines, and the decision was made to move 80 of the 140 ASV Mk. I transmitters to AI, adding to 70 being constructed by <a href="EKCO">EKCO</a> (E.K. Cole). These would be turned into 60 IIIA's and 40 IIIB's. At a further meeting on 23 May, Tizard, perhaps prompted by comments from Director of Signals (Air), suggested that the units were not suitable for operational use, especially due to low reliability, and should be confined to daylight training missions.

By 26 July 70 Blenheims were equipped with Mk. III and the RAE wrote an extensive report on the system. They too had concerns about what they called "partially reliable" systems and pointed out that a significant problem was due to the unreliable antenna connections and cabling. But they went further and stated that the <a href="Self-oscillation">self-exciting concept</a> would simply not work for a production system. These systems used transmitter circuitry as an oscillator to produce the operating frequency, but they had the disadvantage of taking some time to stabilize and then shut down again. Hanbury Brown agreed with this assessment, as did Edmund Cook-Yarborough who had led work on the IIIB at Dundee.

The RAE's comments about the self-exciting transmitter were not random: they were referring to work that was just coming to fruition at EMI as a direct result of Lewis' earlier contract. EMI engineers <a href="Alan%20Blumlein">Alan Blumlein</a> and Eric White had developed a system that dispensed with a self-exciting transmitter circuit and instead used a separate modulator that fed the signal into the transmitter for amplification. The oscillator signal was also sent to the receiver, using it to damp its sensitivity. The combined effect was to sharpen the transmitted pulse, while reducing 'ringing' in the receiver. In a test in May 1940, Hanbury Brown was able to clearly see the return at a range of , and could still make it out when they approached to 400.

Touch, now at <a href="RAE%20Farnborough">RAE Farnborough</a> and having delivered improved versions of ASV, quickly adapted the new oscillator to the existing Mk. III transmitter. Adapting the vertical transmitting "arrowhead", <a href="dipole%20antenna%23Folded%20dipole">folded twin-dipole</a> antenna design on the nose of the aircraft, from Hanbury Brown's work with the Mk. III eliminated any remaining problems. In its first operational tests in July 1940, the new AI Mk. IV demonstrated the ability to detect another Blenheim at a range of and continued to track it down to a minimum of 500. Hanbury Brown stated that "it did everything that we had originally hoped that airborne radar would do for night-fighting". He went on to note that even though Mk. IV arrived only one year after the first Mk. I's, it felt like they had been working for ten years.

A production contract for 3,000 units was immediately started at EMI, Pye, and EKCO. When they left for the US in August, the Tizard Mission team took a Mk. IV, ASV Mk. II and IFF Mk. II with them, via the <a href="National%20Research%20Council%20%28Canada%29">National Research Council (Canada)</a>. During the following discussions, it was agreed that the US would produce AI, while Canada would produce ASV. Western Electric arranged a production license for the Mk. IV in the US, where it was known as the SCR-540. Deliveries began for the P-70 (<a href="Douglas%20A-20%20Havoc">A-20 Havoc</a>) and <a href="Lockheed%20Ventura">PV-1</a> aircraft in 1942.

Throughout the development of the Mk. I to III, various units had been flying the systems in an effort to develop suitable interception techniques. Very early on it was decided to dispense with the full reporting chain of the Dowding system and have the radar operators at the <a href="Chain%20Home">Chain Home</a> (CH) sites talk to the fighters directly, greatly reducing delays. This improved matters, and on an increasing number of occasions aircraft received direction from the CH stations towards real targets.

The crews were bound to get lucky eventually, and this came to pass on the night of 22/23 July 1940, when a Blenheim IF of the FIU received direction from the <a href="Poling%2C%20West%20Sussex">Poling</a> CH station and picked up the target at range. The CH radar operator directed them until the observer visually spotted a Do 17. The pilot closed to before opening fire, continuing to close until they were so close that oil spewing from the target covered their windscreen. Breaking off, the Blenheim flipped upside down, and with no visibility the pilot didn't recover until reaching . The target crashed off <a href="Bognor%20Regis">Bognor Regis</a>, on the south coast of England. This was the first confirmed successful use of airborne radar known to history.

In spite of this success, it was clear the Blenheim was simply not going to work as a fighter. On several occasions the CH stations directed the fighters to a successful radar capture, only to have the target slowly pull away from the fighter. In one case the Blenheim was able to see the target, but when it spotted them the aircraft increased power and disappeared. From 1 to 15 October 1940 Mk. III-equipped fighters from <a href="RAF%20Kenley">RAF Kenley</a> made 92 flights, performed 28 radar interceptions, and made zero kills.

The arrival of the Mk. IV in July 1940 improved matters, but it was the delivery of the <a href="Bristol%20Beaufighter">Bristol Beaufighter</a> starting in August that produced a truly effective system. The Beaufighter had considerably more powerful engines, speed that allowed it to catch its targets, and a powerful gun pack of four 20 mm cannon that could easily destroy a bomber in a single pass. Squadron use began in October, and its first victory came soon after on 19/20 November when a Beaufighter IF of No. 604 Squadron destroyed a Ju 88A-5 near <a href="Chichester">Chichester</a>, very close to the first success of the Mk. III.

Through August and September 1940 the "Luftwaffe" met the Dowding system in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a>, and in spite of great effort, failed to defeat Fighter Command. Tizard's letter of 1936 proved prophetic; with their loss during the day, the "Luftwaffe" moved to a night campaign. <a href="The%20Blitz">The Blitz</a> began in earnest in September.

Dowding had been under almost continual criticism from all quarters long before this point; he was still in power after the normal retirement age for officers, had a prickly personality that earned him the nickname "Stuffy", and kept tight-fisted control over Fighter Command. He was also criticized for his inactivity in ending the fight between <a href="Keith%20Park">Keith Park</a> and <a href="Trafford%20Leigh-Mallory">Trafford Leigh-Mallory</a>, commanders of 11 and 12 Group around London. Nevertheless, he had the favour of <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> and the demonstrated success of the Battle of Britain, which rendered most complaints moot.

The Blitz changed everything. In September 1940 the "Luftwaffe" flew 6,135 night sorties, leading to only four combat losses. The Dowding system was incapable of handling night interceptions in a practical manner, and Dowding continued to state that the only solution was to get AI into operation. Seeking alternatives, the <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Air%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, <a href="Cyril%20Newall%2C%201st%20Baron%20Newall">Cyril Newall</a>, convened a review committee under the direction of <a href="John%20Salmond">John Salmond</a>. Salmond built a heavyweight panel including <a href="Sholto%20Douglas%2C%201st%20Baron%20Douglas%20of%20Kirtleside">Sholto Douglas</a>, Arthur Tedder, <a href="Philip%20Joubert%20de%20la%20Fert%C3%A9">Philip Joubert de la Ferté</a>, and <a href="Wilfrid%20Freeman">Wilfrid Freeman</a>.

At their first series of meetings on 14 September, the Night Defence Committee began collecting a series of suggestions for improvements, which were discussed in depth on 1 October. These were passed on to Dowding for implementation, but he found that many of their suggestions were already out of date. For instance, they suggested building new radars that could be used over land, allowing the fight to continue throughout the raid. A contract for this type of radar had already been sent out in June or July. They suggested that the filter room at <a href="RAF%20Bentley%20Priory">RAF Bentley Priory</a> be devolved down to the Group headquarters to improve the flow of information, but Dowding had already gone a step further and devolved night interception to the Sector level at the airfields. Dowding accepted only four of the suggestions.

This was followed by another report at the request of Churchill, this time by Admiral <a href="Tom%20Phillips%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Tom Phillips</a>. Phillips returned his report on 16 October, calling for standing patrols by <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a> fighters guided by <a href="searchlight">searchlight</a>s, the so-called "cat's eye" fighters. Dowding replied that the speed and altitude of modern aircraft made such efforts almost useless, stating that Phillips was proposing to "merely revert to a <a href="Wilkins%20Micawber">Micawber</a>-like method of ordering them to fly about and wait for something to turn up." He again stated that AI was the only solution to the problem. Phillips had not ignored AI, but pointed out that "At the beginning of the war, AI was stated to be a month or two ahead. After more than a year, we still hear that in a month or so it may really achieve results."

Dowding's insistence on waiting for AI led directly to his dismissal on 24 November 1940. Many historians and writers, including Bowen, have suggested his dismissal was unwise, and that his identification of AI radar as the only practical solution was ultimately correct. While this may be true, the cat's eye force did result in a number of kills during the Blitz, although their effectiveness was limited and quickly overshadowed by the night fighter force. In May 1941 cat's eye fighters claimed 106 kills to the night fighters' 79, but flew twice as many sorties to do so. Coincidentally a similar system to "cat's eye" fighters, "<a href="Wilde%20Sau">Wilde Sau</a>", would be arrived at independently by the Luftwaffe later in the war.

In spite of best efforts, AI's maximum range remained fixed at the aircraft's altitude, which allowed "Luftwaffe" aircraft to escape interception by flying at lower altitudes. With a five-mile (8 km) accuracy in the ground direction, that meant anything below would be subject to this problem, which accounted for the vast majority of "Luftwaffe" sorties. The lack of ground-based radar coverage over land was another serious limitation.

On 24 November 1939, Hanbury Brown wrote a memo on "Suggestions for Fighter Control by RDF" calling for a new type of radar that would directly display both the target aircraft and the intercepting fighter, allowing ground controllers to directly control the fighter without need for interpretation. The solution was to mount a radar on a motorized platform so it rotated continually, sweeping the entire sky. A motor in the <a href="CRT%20display">CRT display</a> would rotate the beam deflection plates in synchronicity, so blips seen when the antenna was at a particular angle would be displayed at the same angle on the scope display. Using a phosphor that lasted at least one rotation, blips for all targets within range would be drawn on the display at their correct relative angles, producing a map-like image known as a <a href="plan-position%20indicator">PPI</a>. With both the bombers and fighters now appearing on the same display, the radar operator could now direct an intercept directly, eliminating all of the delays.

The problem was finding a radar that was suitably small; CH radar's huge towers obviously could not be swung about in this fashion. By this time the Army had made considerable progress on adapting the AI electronics to build a new radar for detecting ships in the English Channel, CD, with an antenna that was small enough to be swung in bearing. In 1938, RAF pilots noted they could avoid detection by CH while flying at low altitudes, so in August 1939, Watt ordered 24-CD sets under the name Chain Home Low (CHL), using them to fill gaps in CH coverage. These systems were initially rotated by pedalling on a bicycle frame driving a gear set. A joke of the era "was that one could always identify one of the W.A.A.F. R.D.F. operators by her bulging calf muscles and unusually slim figure". Motorized controls for CHL were introduced in April 1941.

By late 1939 it was realized that the rotation of the beam on the radar display could be accomplished using electronics. In December 1939, G.W.A Dummer began development of such a system, and in June 1940 a modified CHL radar was motorized to continually spin in bearing, and connected to one of these new displays. The result was a 360 degree view of the airspace around the radar. Six copies of the prototype <a href="Ground-controlled%20interception">Ground Control Interception</a> radars (GCI) were hand-built at AMES (Air Ministry Experimental Station) and RAE during November and December 1940, and the first went operational at <a href="RAF%20Sopley">RAF Sopley</a> on New Year's Day 1941, with the rest following by the end of the month. Prior to their introduction in December 1940 the interception rate was 0.5%; by May 1941, with a number of operational GCI stations and better familiarity, it was 7%, with a kill rate of around 2.5%.

It was only the combination of AI Mk. IV, the Beaufighter and GCI radars that produced a truly effective system, and it took some time for the crews of all involved to gain proficiency. As they did, interception rates began to increase geometrically:

The percentage of these attributed to the AI equipped force continued to rise; thirty-seven of the kills in May were by AI equipped Beaus or Havocs, and by June these accounted for almost all of the kills.

By this point, the "Luftwaffe" had subjected the UK to a major air campaign and caused an enormous amount of destruction and displacement of civilians. However, it failed to bring the UK to peace talks, nor had any obvious effect on economic output. At the end of May the Germans called off The Blitz, and from then on the UK would be subject to dramatically lower rates of bombing. How much of this was due to the effects of the night fighter force has been a matter of considerable debate among historians. The Germans were turning their attention eastward, and most of the "Luftwaffe" was sent to support these efforts. Even in May, the losses represent only 2.4% of the attacking force, a tiny number that was easily replaceable by the "Luftwaffe".

<a href="Sir%20Arthur%20Harris%2C%201st%20Baronet">Arthur Harris</a> was appointed Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">RAF Bomber Command</a> on 22 February 1942, and immediately set about implementing his plan to destroy Germany through <a href="dehousing">dehousing</a>. As part of their move to area attacks, on the night of 28 March a force dropped explosives and incendiaries on <a href="L%C3%BCbeck">Lübeck</a>, causing massive damage. <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and other Nazi leaders were enraged, and ordered retaliation.

On the night of 23 April 1942, a small raid was made against <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>, followed the next day by a pronouncement by <a href="Gustaf%20Braun%20von%20Stumm">Gustaf Braun von Stumm</a> that they would destroy every location found in the <a href="Baedeker">Baedeker tourist guides</a> that was awarded three stars. Raids of ever-increasing size followed over the next week, in what became known in the UK as the <a href="Baedeker%20Blitz">Baedeker Blitz</a>. This first series of raids ended in early May. When <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> was greatly damaged during the first 1,000-bomber raid, the "Luftwaffe" returned for another week of raids between 31 May to 6 June.

The first raids came as a surprise and were met by ineffective responses. On the first raid a Beaufighter from <a href="No.%20604%20Squadron%20RAF">604 Squadron</a> shot down a single bomber, while the next three raids resulted in no kills, and the next a single kill again. But as the pattern of the attacks grew more obvious—short attacks against smaller coastal cities—the defense responded. Four bombers were shot down on the night of 3/4 May, two more on 7/8th, one on 18th, two on the 23rd. The "Luftwaffe" changed their tactics as well; their bombers would approach at low altitude, climb to spot the target, and then dive again after releasing their bombs. This meant that interceptions with the Mk. IV were possible only during the bomb run.

In the end, the Baedeker raids failed to cause any reduction in the RAF's raids over Germany. Civilian losses were considerable, with 1,637 killed, 1,760 injured, and 50,000 homes destroyed or damaged. In comparison to The Blitz this was relatively minor; 30,000 civilians were killed and 50,000 injured by the end of that campaign. "Luftwaffe" losses were 40 bombers and 150 aircrew. Although the night fighters were not particularly successful, accounting for perhaps 22 aircraft from late April to the end of June, their shortcomings were on the way to being addressed.

The Airborne Group had been experimenting with <a href="microwave">microwave</a> systems as early as 1938 after discovering that a suitable arrangement of the acorn tubes could be operated at wavelengths as short as 30 cm. However, these had very low output, and operated well within the region of reduced sensitivity on the receiver side, so detection ranges were very short. The group gave up on further development for the time being.

Development continued largely at the urging of the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a>, who saw it as a solution to detecting the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a>s of partially submerged <a href="U-Boat">U-Boat</a>s. After a visit by Tizard to GEC's <a href="Hirst%20Research%20Centre">Hirst Research Centre</a> in <a href="Wembley">Wembley</a> in November 1939, and a follow-up visit by Watt, the company took up development and developed a working 25 cm set using modified VT90s by the summer of 1940. With this success, Lovell and a new addition to the Airborne Group, <a href="Alan%20Lloyd%20Hodgkin">Alan Lloyd Hodgkin</a>, began experimenting with horn-type antennas that would offer significantly higher angular accuracy. Instead of broadcasting the radar signal across the entire forward hemisphere of the aircraft and listening to echoes from everywhere in that volume, this system would allow the radar to be used like a <a href="flashlight">flashlight</a>, pointed in the direction of observation. This would greatly increase the amount of energy falling on a target, and improve detection capability.

On 21 February 1940, <a href="John%20Randall%20%28physicist%29">John Randall</a> and <a href="Harry%20Boot">Harry Boot</a> first ran their <a href="cavity%20magnetron">cavity magnetron</a> at 10 cm (3 GHz). In April, GEC was told of their work and asked if they could improve the design. They introduced new sealing methods and an improved cathode, delivering two examples capable of generating 10 kW of power at 10 cm, an order of magnitude better than any existing microwave device. At this wavelength, a half-dipole antenna was only a few centimetres long, and allowed Lovell's team to begin looking at <a href="parabolic%20reflector">parabolic reflector</a>s, producing a beam only 5 degrees wide. This had the enormous advantage of avoiding ground reflections by simply not pointing the antenna downwards, allowing the fighter to see any target at its altitude or above it.

Through this period, Rowe finally concluded that Dundee was unsuitable for any of the researchers, and decided to move again. This time he selected Worth Matravers on the southern coast, where all of the radar teams could once again work together. Due to confused timing and better planning on the part of the AI team, they arrived at Worth Matravers from St Athan before the long convoy from Dundee could make its way south. This caused a traffic jam that further upset Rowe. Nevertheless, everything was set up by the end of May 1940, with the AI team working primarily from huts south of Worth Matravers, and carrying out installations at a nearby airfield. With this move the entire group became the Ministry of Aircraft Production Research Establishment (MAPRE), only to be renamed again as the <a href="Telecommunications%20Research%20Establishment">Telecommunications Research Establishment</a> (TRE) in November 1940.

Soon after the move, Rowe formed a new group under <a href="Herbert%20Skinner">Herbert Skinner</a> to develop the magnetron into an AI system, at that time known as AI, Sentimetric (AIS). Lovell adapted his parabolic antennas to the magnetron with relative ease, and the AIS team immediately detected a passing aircraft when they turned on the set for the first time on 12 August 1940. The next day they were asked to demonstrate the set for managers, but no airplane happened to be flying by. Instead, they had one of the workers bicycle along a nearby cliff carrying a small plate of aluminum sheet. This neatly demonstrated its ability to detect objects very close to the ground. As AIS rapidly developed into the AI Mk. VII, development of the Mk. IV's follow-ons, the Mk. V, and Mk. VI (see below) saw vacillating support.

Considerable additional development of AIS was required, with the first production version arriving in February 1942, and subsequently requiring an extended period of installation development and testing. The first kill by a Mk. VII set was on the night of 5/6 June 1942.

As microwave systems entered service, along with updated versions of aircraft carrying them, the problem arose of what to do with those aircraft carrying Mk. IV that were otherwise serviceable. One possibility, suggested as early as 1942, was homing in on the "Luftwaffe's" own radar sets. The basic operational frequencies of the "Luftwaffe"s counterpart to the Mk. IV, the <a href="Lichtenstein%20radar">FuG 202 Lichtenstein BC radar</a>, had been discovered in December 1942. On 3 April 1943 the Air Interception Committee ordered the TRE to begin considering the homing concept under the codename <a href="Serrate%20radar%20detector">Serrate</a>. As luck would have it, this proved to be perfect timing. In the late afternoon of 9 May 1943, a crew from <a href="Nachtjagdgeschwader%203">IV/NJG.3</a> defected to the UK by flying their fully equipped Ju 88R-1 night fighter, "D5+EV", to <a href="RAF%20Dyce">RAF Dyce</a> in Scotland, giving the TRE their first direct look at the Lichtenstein.

The antenna array of the original Mk. IV was limited by practical factors to be somewhat shorter than the 75 cm that would be ideal for their 1.5 m signals. Lichtenstein operated at 75 cm, making the Mk. IV's antennas almost perfectly suited to pick them up. Sending the signals through the existing motorized switch to a new receiver tuned to the Lichtenstein's frequency produced a display very similar to the one created by the Mk. IV's own transmissions. However, the signal no longer had to travel from the RAF fighter and back again; instead, the signals would only have to travel from the German aircraft to the fighter. According to the <a href="radar%20equation">radar equation</a> this makes the system eight times as sensitive, and the system displayed its ability to track enemy fighters at ranges as great as .

Homing on the enemy's broadcasts meant that there was no accurate way to calculate the range to the target; radar ranging measurements are based on timing the delay between broadcast and reception, and there was no way to know when the enemy's signal was originally broadcast. This meant that the homing device could only be used for the initial tracking, and the final approach would have to be carried out by radar. The extra range of the Mk. VIII was not required in this role as Serrate would bring the fighter within easy tracking range, and the loss of a Mk. IV would not reveal the secret of the magnetron to the Germans. For this reason, the Mk. IV was considered superior to the newer radars for this role, in spite of any technical advantages of the newer designs.

Serrate was first fitted to Beaufighter Mk. VIF aircraft of <a href="No.%20141%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 141 Squadron RAF</a> in June 1943. They began operations using Serrate on the night of 14 June, and by 7 September had claimed 14 German fighters shot down, for 3 losses. The squadron was later handed to <a href="No.%20100%20Group%20RAF">No. 100 Group RAF</a>, who handled special operations within Bomber Command including jamming and similar efforts. In spite of their successes, it was clear that the Beaufighter lacked the speed needed to catch the German aircraft, and Mosquitoes began to replace them late in 1943.

The Germans became aware of their losses to night fighters, and began a rush program to introduce a new radar operating on different frequencies. This led to the lower-<a href="VHF">VHF</a> band <a href="Lichtenstein%20radar%23FuG%20220%20Lichtenstein%20SN-2">FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2</a>, which began to reach operational units in small numbers between August and October 1943, with about 50 units in use by November. In February 1944, No. 80 Sqn noticed a marked decrease in FuG 202 transmissions. By this time the Germans had produced 200 SN-2 sets, and this had reached 1,000 by May. This set deliberately selected a frequency close to that of their ground-based <a href="Freya%20radar">Freya radar</a> sets, in the hopes that these sources would swamp any wide-band receiver set used on RAF aircraft. Early Serrate units were effectively useless by June 1944, and their replacements were never as successful.

Experience demonstrated that the final approach to the target required fast action, too quick for the radar operator to easily communicate corrections to the pilot. In 1940, Hanbury Brown wrote a paper "On Obtaining Visuals from AI Contacts" which demonstrated mathematically that the time delays inherent to the interception system were seriously upsetting the approach. In the short term he suggested the fighters make their approach to dead astern while still out, and then fly straight in. For the longer term, he suggested adding a pilot's indicator that directly demonstrated the direction needed to intercept.

This led to Hanbury Brown's work on the Mark IVA, which differed from the Mk. IV primarily by having an additional display unit in front of the pilot. The radar operator had an additional control, the "strobe", which could be adjusted to pick out returns at a particular range. Only those returns were sent to the pilot's display, resulting in much less clutter. Unlike the operator's display, the pilot's showed the target's location as a single dot in a bore-scope like fashion; if the dot was above and to the right of the centre of the display, the pilot had to turn to the right and climb to intercept. The result was what was known as a "flying spot indicator", a single selected target showing a direct indication of the target's relative position.

Tests were carried out starting in October 1940, and quickly demonstrated a number of minor problems. One of the minor issues is that the crosshairs on the tube that indicated the center would block the spot. A more serious concern was the lack of range information, which the FIU pilots considered critical. Hanbury Brown went to work on these issues, and returned an updated version in December. A U-shaped reticle in the center of the display provided a centre location that left the spot visible. Additionally, the circuitry included a second timebase that produced a longer signal as the fighter approached its target. The output was timed so the line was centred horizontally on the dot. This presented the range in an easily understandable fashion; the line looked like the wings of an aircraft, which naturally grow larger as the fighter approaches it.

The U-shaped centring post was sized so the tips of the U were the same width as the range indication line when the target was at , which indicated that the pilot should throttle back and begin his final approach. Two vertical lines to the sides of the display, the "goal posts", indicated that the target was ahead and it was time to look up to see it. Two smaller lines indicated a range of , at which point the pilot should have seen the target, or had to break away to avoid collision.

At a meeting on 30 December 1940, it was decided to begin limited production of the new indicators as an add-on unit for existing Mk. IV systems, creating the AI Mk. IVA. The first examples arrived in January 1941, with more units from ADEE and <a href="Dynatron%20Radio%20Ltd">Dynatron</a> following in early February. Hanbury Brown's involvement with AI came to an abrupt end during testing of the new unit. During a flight in February 1941 at his oxygen supply failed and he suddenly awoke in an ambulance on the ground. He was no longer allowed to fly on tests, and moved to working on radar <a href="beacon">beacon</a> systems.

Continued work displayed a number of minor problems, and the decision was made to introduce a redesigned unit with significant improvements in packaging, insulation, and other practical changes. This would become the AI Mk. V, which began to arrive from Pye in late February and immediately demonstrated a host of problems. By this time the microwave units were being designed, and the Mk. V was almost cancelled. A contract for over 1,000 units was allowed to continue in case of delays in the new units. By May the issues with the Pye design were ironed out, and the FIU's testing revealed it to be superior to the Mk. IV, especially in terms of maintenance. An RAE report agreed.

The first updated Mk. V sets arrived in April 1942 and were fitted to the <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">de Havilland Mosquito</a> as they became available. A Mk. V equipped Mosquito claimed its first kill on 24/25 June, when a Mosquito NF.II from No. 151 Squadron shot down a <a href="Dornier%20Do%20217">Dornier Do 217</a>E-4 over the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. In practice it was found that pilots had considerable difficulty looking up from the display at the last minute, and the system was used only experimentally. By this time the microwave units had started to arrive in small numbers, so Mk. V production was repeatedly delayed pending their arrival, and eventually cancelled.

Starting in the summer of 1942 the TRE development team began experimenting with systems to project the display onto the windscreen, and by October had combined this with an image of the existing GGS Mk. II <a href="gyro%20gunsight">gyro gunsight</a> to produce a true <a href="head-up%20display">head-up display</a> known as the "Automatic Pilot's Indicator", or API. A single example was fitted to a Beaufighter and tested through October, and numerous modifications and follow-on examples were trialled over the next year.

As AI began to prove itself through early 1940 the RAF realised that the radar supply would soon outstrip the number of suitable aircraft available. With large numbers of single-engine single-seat aircraft already in the night fighter units, some way to fit these with radar was desired. The Air Ministry formed the AI Mk. VI Design Committee to study this in the summer of 1940. The resulting AI Mk. VI design was essentially a Mk. IVA with an additional system that automatically set the strobe range. With no target visible, the system moved the strobe from its minimum setting to a maximum range of about and then started over at the minimum again. This process took about four seconds. If a target was seen, the strobe would stick to it, allowing the pilot to approach the target using his <a href="Radar%20display%23C-Scope">C-scope</a>. The pilot would fly under ground control until the target suddenly appeared on his pilot indicator, and then intercept it.

A prototype of the automatic strobe unit was produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another <a href="breadboard">breadboard</a> prototype of the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, it was found that the strobe would often stick to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick to the wrong target. Eventually a "panacea button" was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.

As the Mk. IVA was modified into its improved Mk. V, the Mk. VI followed suit. But by early 1941 it was decided to make the Mk. VI an entirely new design, to more easily fit in small aircraft. EMI had already been awarded a contract for a dozen prototype units in October 1940 for delivery in February, but these continued changes made this impossible. Nevertheless, they presented a production contract for 1,500 units in December. Between December and March, production examples began arriving and displayed an enormous number of problems, which the engineers worked through one-by one. By July the systems were ready for use, and began being installed in the new Defiant Mk. II early in August, but these demonstrated a problem where the system would lock-on to transmissions from other AI aircraft in the area, which resulted in further modifications. It was not until the beginning of December 1941 that these issues were fully solved and the units were cleared for squadron use.

By this point, supplies of the Beaufighter and the new Mosquito had improved dramatically, and the decision was made to remove all single-engine designs from the night fighter force during 1942. Two Defiant units did switch to the Mk. VI, but they operated for only about four months before converting to the Mosquito. Production for the AI role ended, and the electronics were converted to <a href="Monica%20%28radar%29">Monica</a> tail warning radars for the bomber force, until the mid-1944 knowledge of the Germans' <a href="Flensburg%20radar%20detector">Flensburg radar detector</a>, which spotted Monica transmissions, was revealed to the British.

The Mk. VI had a brief overseas career. One of the early units was experimentally fitted to a Hurricane Mk. IIc, and this led to a production of a single flight of such designs starting in July 1942. These conversions were given such a low priority that they were not complete until the spring of 1943. Some of these aircraft were sent to <a href="Calcutta">Calcutta</a> where they claimed a number of Japanese bombers. An experimental fit on <a href="Hawker%20Typhoon">Hawker Typhoon iA</a> "R7881" was carried out, with the system packed into a standard underwing <a href="drop%20tank">drop tank</a>. This was available in March 1943 and underwent lengthy trials lasting into 1944, but nothing came of this work.

The Mk. IV was a complex lash-up of systems, known collectively in the RAF as the Airborne Radio Installation 5003 (ARI 5003). Individual parts included the R3066 or R3102 receiver, T3065 transmitter, Modulator Type 20, Transmitter Aerial Type 19, Elevation Aerial Type 25, Azimuth Aerial Type 21 and 25, Impedance Matching Unit Type 35, Voltage Control Panel Type 3, and Indicator Unit Type 20 or 48.

As the Mk. IV system worked on a single frequency, it naturally lent itself towards the <a href="Yagi%20antenna">Yagi antenna</a> design, which had been brought to the UK when the Japanese patents were sold to the <a href="Marconi%20Company">Marconi Company</a>. "Yagi" Walters developed a system for AI use using five Yagi antennas.

Transmissions took place from a single arrowhead antenna mounted on the nose of the aircraft. This consisted of a <a href="folded%20dipole">folded dipole</a> with a passive director in front of it, both bent rearward at about 35 degrees, projecting from the nosecone on a mounting rod. For vertical reception, the receiver antennas consisted of two half-wave unipoles mounted above and below the wing, with a reflector behind them. The wing acted as a signal barrier, allowing the antennas to see only the portion of the sky above or below the wing as well as directly in front. These antennas were angled rearward at the same angle as the transmitter. The horizontal receivers and directors were mounted on rods projecting from the leading edge of the wing, the antennas aligned vertically. The fuselage and engine nacelles formed the barriers for these antennas.

All four receiver antennas were connected via separate leads to a motorized switch that selected each one of the inputs in turn, sending it into the amplifier. The output was then switched, using the same system, to one of four inputs into the CRTs. The entire radar dipole aerial setup for the AI Mk.IV was simple in comparison to the 32-dipole "Matratze" (mattress) transceiving array fitted to the noses of the earliest German night fighters to use AI radar, for their own UHF-band <a href="Lichtenstein%20radar%23FuG%20202%20Lichtenstein%20B/C">Lichtenstein B/C</a> airborne radar design from 1942–43.

The Mk. IV display system consisted of two diameter <a href="cathode%20ray%20tubes">cathode ray tubes</a> connected to a common <a href="timebase%20generator">timebase generator</a> normally set to cross the display in the time it would take to receive a signal from . The displays were installed beside each other at the radar operator's station at the rear of the Beaufighter. The tube on the left showed the vertical situation (altitude) and the one on the right showed the horizontal situation (azimuth).

Each receiver antenna was sent to one of the channels of the displays in turn, causing one of the displays to refresh. For instance, at a given instant the switch might be set to send the signal to the left side of the azimuth display. The timebase generator was triggered to start sweeping the CRT dot up the screen after the transmission ended. Reflections would cause the dot to be deflected to the left, creating a blip whose vertical location could be measured against a scale to determine range. The switch would then move to the next position and cause the right-hand side of the display to be redrawn, but the signal inverted so the dot moved to the right. The switching occurred fast enough that the display looked continuous.

Because each antenna was aimed to be sensitive primarily in a single direction, the length of the blips depended on the position of the target relative to the fighter. For instance, a target located 35 degrees above the fighter would cause the signal in the upper vertical receiver to be maximized, causing a long blip to appear on the upper trace, and none on the lower trace. Although less sensitive directly forward, both vertical antennas could see directly in front of the fighter, so a target located dead ahead caused two slightly shorter blips, one on either side of the centreline.

For interception, the radar operator had to compare the length of the blips on the displays. If the blip was slightly longer on the right than left side of the azimuth display, for instance, he would instruct the pilot to turn right in an effort to centre the target. Interceptions normally resulted in a stream of left/right and up/down corrections while reading out the (hopefully) decreasing range.

The trailing edge of the transmitter pulse was not perfectly sharp and caused the receiver signals to ring for a short time even if they were turned on after the pulse was ostensibly complete. This leftover signal caused a large permanent blip known as the "transmitter break through" which appeared at the short-range end of the tubes (left and bottom). A control known as the Oscillator Bias allowed the exact timing of the receiver's activation relative to the transmitter pulse to be adjusted, normally so the remains of the pulse were just visible.

Due to the wide pattern of the transmission antenna, some of the signal always hit the ground, reflecting some of it back at the aircraft to cause a ground return. This was so powerful that it was received on all of the antennas, even the upper vertical receiver which would otherwise be hidden from signals below it. As the shortest distance, and thus the strongest signal, was received from reflections directly below the aircraft, this caused a strong blip to appear across all the displays at the range of the fighter's altitude. The ground further in front of the aircraft also caused returns, but these were increasingly distant (see <a href="slant%20range">slant range</a>) and only some of the signal was reflected back at the aircraft while an increasing portion was scattered forward and away. Ground returns at further distances were thus smaller, resulting in a roughly triangular series of lines at the top or right side of the displays, known as the "Christmas tree effect", beyond which it was not possible to see targets.

Serrate used the Mk. IV equipment for reception and display, replacing only the receiver unit. This could be switched in or out of the circuit from the cockpit, which turned off the transmitter as well. In a typical interception, the radar operator would use Serrate to track the German fighter, using the directional cues from the displays to direct the pilot on an intercept course. Range was not supplied, but the operator could make a rough estimate by observing the signal strength and the way the signals changed as the fighter maneuvered. After following Serrate to an estimated range of , the fighter's own radar would be turned on for the final approach.

Starting in 1940, British aircraft were increasingly equipped with the <a href="IFF%20Mk.%20II">IFF Mk. II</a> system, which allowed radar operators to determine whether a blip on their screen was a friendly aircraft. IFF was a responder that sent out a pulse of radio signal immediately on reception of a radio signal from a radar system. The IFF's transmission mixed with the radar's own pulse, causing the blip to stretch out in time from a small peak to an extended rectangular shape.

The rapid introduction of new types of radars working on different frequencies meant the IFF system had to respond to an ever-increasing list of signals, and the direct response of the Mk. II required an ever-increasing number of sub-models, each turned to different frequencies. By 1941 it was clear that this was going to grow without bound, and a new solution was needed. The result was a new series of IFF units which used the indirect interrogation technique. These operated on a fixed frequency, different from the radar. The interrogation signal was sent from the aircraft by pressing a button on the radar, which caused the signal to be sent out in pulses synchronized to the radar's main signal. The received signal was amplified and mixed into the same video signal as the radar, causing the same extended blip to appear.

Transponder systems used on the ground provide the ability to home in on the transponder's location, a technique that was widely used with the Mk. IV, as well as many other AI and ASV radar systems.

Homing transponders are similar to IFF systems in general terms, but used shorter pulses. When a signal was received from the radar, the transponder responded with a short pulse on the same frequency, the original radar pulse would not be reflected so there was no need to lengthen the signal as in the case of IFF. The pulse was sent to the Mk. IV's display and appeared as a sharp "blip". Depending on the location of the transponder relative to the aircraft, the blip would be longer on the left or right of the azimuth display, allowing the operator to guide the aircraft to the transponder using exactly the same methods as a conventional aircraft intercept.

Due to the physical location of the transponder, on the ground, the receiver antenna with the best view of the transponder was the one mounted under the wing. The radar operator would normally pick up the signal on the lower side of the elevation display, even at very long distances. Since the signal from the beacon was quite powerful, the Mk. IV included a switch that set the timebase to for long-distance pickup. Once they approached the general area, the signal would be strong enough to begin to appear on the azimuth (left-right) tube.

Another system used with the Mk. IV was the <a href="Blind%20approach%20beacon%20system">Beam-Approach Beacon System</a>, or BABS, which indicated the runway centreline.

The general concept pre-dated the Mk. IV and was essentially a UK version of the German <a href="Lorenz%20beam">Lorenz beam</a> system. Lorenz, or Standard Beam Approach as it was known in the UK, used a single transmitter located off the far end of the <a href="active%20runway">active runway</a> that was alternately connected to one of two slightly directional antennas using a motorized switch. The antennas were aimed so they sent their signals to the left and right of the runway, but their signals overlapped down the centreline. The switch spent 0.2 seconds connected to the left antenna (as seen from the aircraft) and then 1 second on the right.

To use Lorenz, a conventional radio was tuned to the transmission, and the operator would listen for the signal and try to determine if they heard dots or dashes. If they heard dots, the short 0.2 s pulse, they would know they were too far to the left, and turned to the right in order to reach the centreline. Dashes indicated they should turn left. In the centre the receiver could hear both signals, which merged to form a steady tone, the "equisignal".

For BABS, the only change was to change the broadcast's transmissions to a series of short pulses rather than a continuous signal. These pulses were sent out when triggered by the AI radar's signals and were powerful enough that they could be picked up by the Mk. IV receiver within a few miles. On reception, the Mk. IV would receive either the dots or dashes, and the operator would see an alternating series of blips centred in the display, popping out and then disappearing as the BABS antennas switched. The duration of the blip indicated whether the aircraft was to the left or right, and became a continuous blip on the centreline. This technique was known as "AI beam approach" (AIBA).

Due to it being based on the same basic equipment as the original Mk. IV AI, BABS could also be used with the <a href="Rebecca/Eureka%20transponding%20radar">Rebecca</a> equipment, originally developed to home on ground transponders for dropping supplies over occupied Europe. The later "Lucero" unit was essentially an adapter for a Rebecca receiver, mating it to any existing display; AI, ASV, or <a href="H2S%20%28radar%29">H2S</a>.

Three Beauties of the Present Day

Utamaro was the leading ukiyo-e artist in the 1790s in the ' genre of pictures of female beauties. He was known for his ', which focus on the heads. The three models in "Three Beauties of the Present Day" were frequent subjects of Utamaro's portraiture. Each figure in the work is adorned with an identifying <a href="Mon%20%28emblem%29">family crest</a>. The portraits are idealized, and at first glance their faces seem similar, but subtle differences in their features and expressions can be detected—a level of realism at the time unusual in ukiyo-e, and a contrast with the stereotyped beauties in earlier masters such as <a href="Suzuki%20Harunobu">Harunobu</a> and <a href="Torii%20Kiyonaga">Kiyonaga</a>. The luxurious print was published by <a href="Tsutaya%20J%C5%ABzabur%C5%8D">Tsutaya Jūzaburō</a> and made with multiple woodblocks—one for each colour—and the background was dusted with <a href="muscovite">muscovite</a> to produce a glimmering effect. It is believed to have been quite popular, and the triangular positioning became a vogue in the 1790s. Utamaro produced several other pictures with the same arrangement of the same three beauties, and all three appeared in numerous other portraits by Utamaro and other artists.

<a href="Ukiyo-e">Ukiyo-e</a> art flourished in Japan during the <a href="Edo%20period">Edo period</a> from the 17th to 19th centuries, and took as its primary subjects <a href="oiran">courtesans</a>, <a href="kabuki">kabuki</a> actors, and others associated with the "floating world" lifestyle of the <a href="Y%C5%ABkaku">pleasure districts</a>. Alongside paintings, mass-produced <a href="Woodblock%20printing">woodblock prints</a> were a major form of the genre. In the mid-18th century full-colour ' prints became common, printed using a large number of woodblocks, one for each colour. Towards the close of the 18th century there was a peak in both the quality and quantity of work. A prominent genre was ' ("pictures of beauties"), which depicted most often courtesans and <a href="geisha">geisha</a> at leisure, and promoted the entertainments to be found in the pleasure districts.

<a href="Katsukawa%20Shunsh%C5%8D">Katsukawa Shunshō</a> introduced the ' "large-headed picture" in the 1760s; he and other members of the <a href="Katsukawa%20school">Katsukawa school</a> such as <a href="Katsukawa%20Shunk%C5%8D%20I">Shunkō</a> popularized the form for ' actor prints, as well as the dusting of <a href="mica">mica</a> in the backgrounds to produce a glittering effect. <a href="Torii%20Kiyonaga">Kiyonaga</a> was the pre-eminent portraitist of beauties in the 1780s, and the tall, graceful beauties in his work had a great influence on <a href="Kitagawa%20Utamaro">Kitagawa Utamaro</a> (–1806), who was to succeed him in fame. Utamaro studied under <a href="Toriyama%20Sekien">Toriyama Sekien</a> (1712–1788), who had trained in the <a href="Kan%C5%8D%20school">Kanō school</a> of painting. Around 1782, Utamaro came to work for the publisher <a href="Tsutaya%20J%C5%ABzabur%C5%8D">Tsutaya Jūzaburō</a>.

In 1791, Tsutaya published three books by <a href="Sant%C5%8D%20Ky%C5%8Dden">Santō Kyōden</a> in the ' genre of humorous tales of adventures in the pleasure quarters; deeming them too frivolous, the <a href="Bakufu">military government</a> punished the author with fifty days in <a href="manacle">manacle</a>s and fined the publisher half his property. His luck was reversed shortly after with a new success: Utamaro began producing the first ' portraits, adapting ' to the ' genre. Their popularity restored Tsutaya's fortunes and made Utamaro's in the 1790s.

"Three Beauties of the Present Day" is considered one of Utamaro's representative early works. It depicts the profiles of three celebrity beauties of 1790s <a href="Edo">Edo</a> (modern Tokyo). Utamaro's subjects were not courtesans, as was expected in ukiyo-e, but young women known around Edo for their beauty. These three were frequent subjects of Utamaro's art, and often appeared together. Each is identified with an associated <a href="Mon%20%28emblem%29">family crest</a>.

In the centre poses Tomimoto Toyohina, a famed geisha of the Tamamuraya house in the <a href="Yoshiwara">Yoshiwara</a> pleasure district. She was dubbed "Tomimoto" having made her name playing "<a href="Tomimoto-bushi">Tomimoto-bushi</a>" music on the <a href="shamisen">shamisen</a>. Like the other two models, she has her hair up in the fashionable <a href="Shimada%20%28hairstyle%29">Shimada</a> style that was popular at the time. Contrasted with the homelier teahouse-girl garments of the other two models, she is dressed in the showier geisha style. The Tomimoto crest's <a href="Primula%20sieboldii">Japanese primrose</a> design adorns the sleeve of her kimono. Toyohina's birthdate is unknown.

To the right Naniwaya Kita, also known as "O-Kita", well-known daughter of the owner of a <a href="Ochaya">teahouse</a> in <a href="Asakusa%2C%20Tokyo">Asakusa</a> near the temple <a href="Sens%C5%8D-ji">Sensō-ji</a>. She is said to have been fifteen in the portrait, in which she wears a patterned black kimono and holds an " <a href="hand%20fan">hand fan</a> printed with her family emblem, a <a href="paulownia">paulownia</a> crest.

At left is Takashima Hisa, also called "O-Hisa", from in <a href="Ry%C5%8Dgoku">Ryōgoku</a>. She was the eldest daughter of Takashima Chōbei, the owner of a roadside teahouse at his home called Senbeiya in which Hisa worked attracting customers. Tradition places her age at sixteen when the portrait was made, and there is a subtly discernible difference in maturity in the faces of the two teahouse girls. Hisa holds a hand towel over her left shoulder and an identifying three-leaved <a href="Quercus%20dentata">daimyo oak</a> crest decorates her kimono.

Rather than attempting to capture a realistic portrayal of the three, Utamaro idealizes their likenesses. To many viewers, the faces in this and other portraits of the time seem little individuated, or perhaps not at all. Others emphasize the subtle differences that distinguish the three in the shapes of the mouths, noses, and eyes: Kita has plump cheeks and an innocent expression; her eyes are almond-shaped, and the bridge of her nose high; Hisa has a stiffer, proud expression, and the bridge of Hisa's nose is lower and her eyes rounder than Kita's; Toyohina's features fall in between, and she has an air of being older and more intellectual.

The print is a vertical <a href="Woodblock%20printing%20in%20Japan%23Print%20sizes">ōban</a> of , and is a '—a full-colour ukiyo-e print made from multiple woodblocks, one for each colour; the inked blocks are pressed on <a href="Washi">Japanese handmade paper</a>. To produce a glittering effect the background is dusted with <a href="muscovite">muscovite</a>, a variety of mica. The image falls under the genres of ' ("portraits of beauties") and " ("big-headed pictures"), the latter a genre Utamaro pioneered and was strongly associated with.

The composition of the three figures is triangular, a traditional arrangement Tadashi Kobayashi compares to "", in which <a href="Confucius">Confucius</a>, <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a>, and <a href="Laozi">Laozi</a> symbolize the unity of <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a>, <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, and <a href="Taoism">Taoism</a>; similarly, Kobayashi says, Utamaro demonstrates the unity of the three competing celebrity beauties in the print.

The print was designed by Utamaro and published by Tsutaya Jūzaburō in the fourth or fifth year of the <a href="Kansei">Kansei</a> era of the <a href="Japanese%20era%20name">traditional Japanese era divisions</a> (). Tsutaya's publisher's seal is printed on the left above Hisa's head, and a round censor's seal appears above it. Utamaro's signature is printed in the bottom left.

Fumito Kondō considered the print revolutionary; such expressive, individualized faces are not seen in the stereotyped figures in the works of Utamaro's predecessors such as <a href="Suzuki%20Harunobu">Harunobu</a> and Kiyonaga, and it was the first time in ukiyo-e history that the beauties were drawn from the general urban population rather than the pleasure quarters.

Records indicate Kita was rated highly in teahouse rankings, and that curious fans flooded her father's teahouse; it is said this caused her to become arrogant and cease to serve tea unless called for. Hisa ranked lower, though still appears to have been quite popular—a wealthy merchant offered 1500 "" for her, but her parents refused and she continued to work at the teahouse. Utamaro took advantage of this rivalry in his art, going as far as to portray the two tearoom beauties in tug-of-war and other competitions, with deities associated with their neighbourhoods supporting them: Buddhist guardian deity <a href="Acala">Acala</a> was associated with Yagenbori, and supported Hisa; <a href="Guanyin">Guanyin</a>, the Goddess of Mercy, was associated with the temple Sensō-ji in Asakusa, and supported Kita.

The triangular positioning of three figures became something of a vogue in prints of the mid-1790s. The "Three Beauties of the Kansei Era" normally refer to the three who appear in this print; on occasion, Utamaro replaced Toyohina with Kikumoto O-Han. Utamaro placed the three beauties in the same composition three or four years later in a print called "Three Beauties", in which Hisa holds a teacup saucer in her left hand rather than a handkerchief, and Kita holds her fan in both hands. To Eiji Yoshida, the figures in this print lack the personalities that were the charm of the earlier. Yoshida thought less of the further undifferentiated personalities of a later print with the same triangular composition, "Three Beauties Holding Bags of Snacks", published by Yamaguchiya. As testimony to their popularity, the three models often appeared in the works of other artists, and Utamaro continued to use them in other prints, individually or in pairs.

There are no records of sales figures of ukiyo-e from the era in which the print was made. Determining the popularity of a print requires indirect means, one of which is to compare the differences in surviving copies. For example, the more copies printed, the more the woodblocks wore down, resulting in loss of line clarity and details. Another example is that publishers often made changes to the blocks in later print runs. Researchers use clues such as these to determine whether prints were frequently reprinted—a sign of their popularity. The original printing of "Three Beauties of the Present Day" had the title in a bookmark-shape in the top right corner with the names of the three beauties to its left. Only two copies of this <a href="State%20%28printmaking%29">state</a> are believed to have survived; they are in the collections of the <a href="Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts%2C%20Boston">Museum of Fine Arts</a> in Boston, and the Koishikawa Ukiyo-e Art Museum in Tokyo. Later printings lack the title, the names of the beauties, or both, and the position of the publisher's and censor's seals varies slightly. The reasons for the changes are subject to speculation, such as that the beauties may have moved away, or their fame may have fallen. Based on clues such as these changes, researchers believe this print was a popular hit for Utamaro and Tsutaya.

The Boat Race 1993

The 139th <a href="The%20Boat%20Race">Boat Race</a> took place on 27 March 1993. Held annually, the Boat Race is a <a href="Rowing%20%28sport%29%23Side%20by%20side">side-by-side rowing</a> race between crews from the Universities of <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a> along the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>. Cambridge, using "<a href="Oar%20%28sport%20rowing%29">cleaver blades</a>" for the first time in the history of the race, won by three-and-a-half lengths in a victory that was described in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" as "crushingly conclusive". The winning time of 17 minutes exactly was the fourth-fastest time in the event. In winning the event, Cambridge prevented Oxford making it seventeen wins from the last eighteen races and levelling the overall score for the first time since the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201929">1929 race</a>.

Oxford's crew featured two Olympic gold medallists and saw changes in their rowers and cox in the lead-up to the event. The race was umpired by the former Oxford <a href="Blue%20%28university%20sport%29">Blue</a> <a href="Mark%20Evans%20%28rower%29">Mark Evans</a> who controversially instigated changes to the start procedure of the race.

In the reserve race, Cambridge's <a href="Goldie%20%28Cambridge%20University%20Boat%20Club%29">Goldie</a> defeated Oxford's Isis, while Cambridge won the <a href="Women%27s%20Boat%20Race">Women's Boat Race</a>.

<a href="The%20Boat%20Race">The Boat Race</a> is a <a href="Rowing%20%28sport%29%23Side%20by%20side">side-by-side rowing</a> competition between the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a> (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues") and the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues"). First held in 1829, the race takes place on the <a href="The%20Championship%20Course">Championship Course</a> on the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> in southwest London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201992">1992 race</a> by one-and-a-quarter lengths, with Cambridge leading overall with 69 victories to Oxford's 68 (excluding the "dead heat" of 1877). Oxford had won 16 of the previous 17 races, a run interrupted by Cambridge's seven-length victory in the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201986">1986 race</a>.

The first <a href="Women%27s%20Boat%20Race">Women's Boat Race</a> took place in 1927, but the event did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s. Until 2014, the contest was conducted as part of the <a href="Henley%20Boat%20Races">Henley Boat Races</a>, but as of the <a href="The%20Boat%20Races%202015">2015 race</a>, it is held on the River Thames, on the same day as the men's main and reserve races. The reserve race, contested between Oxford's Isis boat and Cambridge's Goldie boat has been held since 1965. It usually takes place on the Tideway, prior to the main Boat Race.
Cambridge selected <a href="Oar%20%28sport%20rowing%29%23Cleaver">cleaver blades</a> for the first time in the history of the race, following the successful use of the oars in the <a href="Rowing%20at%20the%201992%20Summer%20Olympics">1992 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="1992%20Summer%20Olympics">Barcelona</a>. The surface area of the cleaver was approximately 20% larger than the conventional <a href="Macon%20spoons">macon blades</a>. Oxford practised with cleaver blades in some of their outings leading up to the race, and were prepared to use them should the weather conditions be suitable, but on the day itself they opted to remain with the macon blades.

The umpire for the race was the Canadian Olympic gold medallist and former Oxford Blue <a href="Mark%20Evans%20%28rower%29">Mark Evans</a> who had rowed in the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201983">1983</a> and <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201984">1984 races</a>. He caused controversy by instigating a new starting method whereby he would hold the crews for up to ten seconds between the conventional "set" and "go" commands. Evans had umpired the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201991">1991 race</a> in which he had also used his own starting method in preference to the traditional <a href="Amateur%20Rowing%20Association">Amateur Rowing Association</a> instructions. In response to any potential delay at the start during which time the boats will be dragged along with the tide, one of the stake-boat men, Bob Hastings, responsible for holding the boats until the "go" command is given stated: "If the boats start to drag I will let go, before I am dragged out of the stake-boat". Both Alan Inns, former coach and advisor to Cambridge, and Steve Royle, Oxford's director of rowing, expressed concerns over Evans' methodology.

The Oxford crew weighed an average of nearly more per rower than their opponents. Oxford's <a href="Matthew%20Pinsent">Matthew Pinsent</a> was the heaviest rower while Cambridge's Sinclair Gore was the youngest, aged 19. Cambridge's crew featured three returning <a href="Blue%20%28university%20sport%29">Blues</a> in Dirk Bangert, David Gillard and James Behrens, while Oxford saw five former Boat Race rowers return. Overall, half of the rowers were non-British (six nationalities representing Oxford, three representing Cambridge) and the same number were <a href="postgraduate">postgraduate</a>s. The Cambridge boat club president Behrens claimed: "All our boat are at Cambridge on academic merit. They came for a particular course ... and they also row." In contrast, an editorial in "The Times" claimed: "The performers are no longer ingenuous native undergraduates but supercharged, international, professional rowing machines." Oxford's <a href="Bruce%20Robertson%20%28rower%29">Bruce Robertson</a> (men's eight) and Pinsent (coxless pair) were both gold medallists at the Barcelona Olympics.

A late change in the Oxford cox saw Samantha Benham replace Gordon Buxton to steer the Dark Blues, becoming the eighth female cox in the history of the race. Oxford's Royle noted that Buxton's form had declined in the run-in to the race, while Benham was "handling the pressure a lot better." Cambridge cox, Martin Haycock, suggested that female coxes were not as accomplished as their male counterparts: "We had one cox who was exceptionally good at giving massages but on the whole ... they're not aggressive or tough enough." Oxford also saw a change to their crew in the week preceding the race. Old Etonian undergraduate Ed Haddon (who had rowed for Isis in 1992) was dropped in favour of German Philipp Schuller. Schuller had arrived at Oxford just two months earlier, but rejected suggestions that his late inclusion was symptomatic of the recent influx of "professionals" to the race. Of his selection, he noted: "You can't have one of the most respected races in the world and then limit it to English people between the ages of 19 and 21 ... on the day we went for whoever would make the boat go fastest. It was done entirely on merit." Schuller's compatriot and opponent Dirk Bangert had struggled with the move to cleavers, finding it difficult to adjust his timing: "I nearly didn't make it. I couldn't get this rhythm until about three weeks ago and was not sure of my place."

Oxford's finishing coach was <a href="Mike%20Spracklen">Mike Spracklen</a> who had assisted the Dark Blues in five victorious races, while Cambridge had New Zealander <a href="Harry%20Mahon">Harry Mahon</a> in charge for the first time, assisted by John Wilson (who had helped coach Oxford to a win in the 1991 race), and Sean Bowden, who was subsequently credited with "being half of the team which first turned Cambridge round". Oxford's head coach <a href="Patrick%20Sweeney%20%28rower%29">Patrick Sweeney</a> noted: "If [Cambridge] get away, they will be hard to beat. If they don't, they're dead meat."

Oxford were strong pre-race favourites, having won 16 of the last 17 races. Cambridge won the <a href="coin%20flipping">toss</a> and elected to start from the Surrey station. Two minutes after the start, and in cold, overcast conditions, Cambridge's cox Martin Haycock was level with Oxford's Jo Michels who occupied the number two seat in the Dark Blue boat. Responding to a call to push on, Cambridge were clear upon reaching the Mile Post in record time, and moved in front of Oxford. Further record times were set as the Light Blues passed under <a href="Hammersmith%20Bridge">Hammersmith Bridge</a> and by Chiswick Steps before they passed the finishing post three-and-a-half lengths clear in 17 minutes. It was Cambridge's first victory since the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201986">1986 race</a> and just their second victory in eighteen years. The winning time was the fourth fastest in the history of the event, surpassed only by Oxford in the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201991">1991</a>, <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201984">1984</a> and <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201976">1976 races</a>, and was Cambridge's fastest time ever. Cambridge's victory prevented the overall score from being levelled for the first time since 1929.

In the reserve race, Cambridge's <a href="Goldie%20%28Cambridge%20University%20Boat%20Club%29">Goldie</a> won by nine lengths over Isis, their sixth victory in seven years. Cambridge won the 48th Women's Boat Race by four-and-a-half lengths in a time of 6 minutes and 10 seconds, their fourth victory in five years.

The journalist David Miller, writing for "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", described Cambridge's victory as "crushingly conclusive". Cambridge's <a href="Malcolm%20Baker">Malcolm Baker</a> said: "We knew we could do it after about 25 strokes." Behrens explained "Our strength was that we were more uniform than Oxford. We have proved that you do not have to be an Olympic champion to win the Boat Race." The Oxford Boat Club president Pinsent conceded: "They put right a lot of mistakes they have made in the past, and they rowed outstandingly well." Spracklen agreed: "Cambridge got too far away. They were a better boat in that race. All credit to them." Cambridge's number two, David Gillard, said "there was a lot of revenge out there".

Writing in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", the journalist Chris Arnot noted that the Cambridge crew had used <a href="creatine%20supplements">creatine supplements</a> in order to attempt to enhance their performance. Used extensively at the 1992 Olympics, by athletes including <a href="Linford%20Christie">Linford Christie</a> and <a href="Sally%20Gunnell">Sally Gunnell</a>, and given to horses and greyhounds, creatine was believed to provide legal energy-enhancing effects to the crew.

Barry Voight

Barry Voight (; born 1937) is an American <a href="geologist">geologist</a>, <a href="volcanologist">volcanologist</a>, author, and engineer. After earning his <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">Ph.D.</a> at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, Voight worked as a professor of geology at several universities, including <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20University">Pennsylvania State University</a>, where he taught from 1964 until his retirement in 2005. He remains an <a href="emeritus">emeritus</a> professor there and still conducts research, focusing on rock mechanics, <a href="plate%20tectonics">plate tectonics</a>, disaster prevention, and <a href="geotechnical%20engineering">geotechnical engineering</a>.

In April 1980, Voight's publications on landslides and <a href="avalanche">avalanche</a>s and other <a href="mass%20wasting">mass movements</a> attracted the attention of Rocky Crandell of the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> (USGS), who asked him to look at a growing bulge on the <a href="Mount%20St.%20Helens">Mount St. Helens</a> volcano in the state of <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>. Voight foresaw the collapse of the mountain's north flank as well as a powerful eruption. His predictions came true when St. Helens <a href="1980%20eruption%20of%20Mount%20St.%20Helens">erupted in May 1980</a>; Voight was then hired by the USGS to investigate the debris avalanche that initiated the eruption. After his work at Mount St. Helens brought him international recognition, Voight continued researching and guiding monitoring efforts at several active volcanoes throughout his career, including <a href="Nevado%20del%20Ruiz">Nevado del Ruiz</a> in Colombia, <a href="Mount%20Merapi">Mount Merapi</a> in Indonesia, and <a href="Soufri%C3%A8re%20Hills">Soufrière Hills</a>, a volcano on the Caribbean island of <a href="Montserrat">Montserrat</a>. For his research, publications, and disaster prevention work as a volcanologist and engineer, Voight has been honored with numerous awards, appointments, and medals.

Born in 1937, Voight grew up in <a href="Yonkers%2C%20New%20York">Yonkers, New York</a>. His brothers are actor <a href="Jon%20Voight">Jon Voight</a> and songwriter <a href="Chip%20Taylor">Chip Taylor</a>, actress <a href="Angelina%20Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a> is his niece, and musician <a href="James%20Haven">James Haven</a> is his nephew. Barry and his wife Mary Anne (née Verdisco) have two daughters, Lisa and Barbara. Voight's father was professional <a href="golf">golf</a> player Elmer "Elmo" Voight, a leader in the effort to break the <a href="racial%20segregation">color barrier</a> in golf, and his mother Barbara was a teacher and swim instructor. Voight and his brothers grew up playing golf, and Barry also developed an interest in <a href="Swimming%20%28sport%29">swimming</a>.

Voight graduated from <a href="Archbishop%20Stepinac%20High%20School">Archbishop Stepinac High School</a> in 1955. After high school, Voight pursued a 5-year intensive <a href="Double%20degree">dual-degree program</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Notre%20Dame">University of Notre Dame</a>, studying landslips along <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> and receiving undergraduate degrees in geology in 1959 and in <a href="civil%20engineering">civil engineering</a> in 1960. He earned his <a href="master%27s%20degree">master's degree</a> in civil engineering from Notre Dame in 1961. Voight attributes his interest in science to his mentors at Notre Dame, professors Ray Gutschick and Erhard Winkler. After spending one year studying at <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a>, Voight transferred to <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, where he graduated with a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">Ph.D.</a> in geology in 1965, studying rock mechanics and structural geology under Fred Donath. While at Columbia, Voight was named a President's Fellow, and taught a lecture course called "Geology for Engineers".

Voight began teaching in 1961, serving as a <a href="teaching%20assistant">teaching assistant</a> at the University of Notre Dame while pursuing his master's degree in civil engineering. From 1961−1963, he served as a teaching assistant at Cornell and Columbia. In 1964, he joined the faculty at <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20University">Pennsylvania State University</a> (Penn State) as an assistant professor of geology, becoming a full professor of geology and <a href="geotechnical%20engineering">geotechnical engineering</a> in 1978. Voight taught at Penn State for more than four decades, retiring from teaching in June 2005 but continuing his research.

While at Penn State, Voight had a joint affiliation with the school's Department of Mineral Engineering and taught courses in physical geology, mechanics of geological materials, and volcanology. During his career, he also lectured as a guest professor at the <a href="Delft%20University%20of%20Technology">Delft University of Technology</a> in the Netherlands in 1972, working under Jacques Dozy, and served as a <a href="visiting%20scholar">visiting professor</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a> in 1973 and at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Santa%20Barbara">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>, in 1981. Still an <a href="emeritus">emeritus</a> professor at Penn State, he initiated an endowment under his name to contribute to the education of volcanic hazard specialists from developing countries.

Voight performed work in 1971–1973 for the <a href="United%20States%20Bureau%20of%20Mines">United States Bureau of Mines</a>. In 1978, he published the first volume of a treatise on avalanches, titled "Rockslides and Avalanches". After the second volume was released in 1980, the work became a benchmark in studying avalanches and other forms of <a href="mass%20wasting">mass movement</a>.

A month prior to the <a href="1980%20eruption%20of%20Mount%20St.%20Helens">1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens</a>, Voight was contacted by Rocky Crandell, a <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> (USGS) employee working in the Vancouver office near the mountain. Crandell sought Voight's expertise in landslides, hoping Voight would opine on a growing bulge, long, which had emerged on the mountain's north face. In his reporting to Crandell and his associates, Voight said that the bulge could fail and collapse the volcano's entire north sector. He suggested they begin monitoring the rate of movement of the bulge, worried that the collapse could trigger an eruption. He also advised hiring a local surveyor to take measurements, offending several of the geologists. Shortly after, Voight left the mountain and returned to teaching classes at Penn State. Before the eruption, he had sent his full report to the USGS, summarizing his predictions, depicting the failure of the bulge and the collapse of the mountain's north side followed by a violent eruption. After a <a href="Richter%20magnitude%20scale">magnitude</a> 5.1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope caused that part of the volcano to slide, Mount St. Helens erupted, causing $1.1 billion in damage and killing 57 people.

After the eruption, Voight accepted a position as a consultant for the USGS. He led the investigation into the volcano debris avalanche which had occurred during the eruption, guiding other volcanologists including <a href="Harry%20Glicken">Harry Glicken</a>, who built upon Voight's preliminary research to create his report "Rockslide-Debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington" (1996). Voight's work won him international renown, and he later cited his experiences there as "career-changing". Although Voight already had a burgeoning interest in volcanology, the eruption at Mount St. Helens propelled him to dedicate himself to the field. His work helped reinvigorate widespread interest in landslides and other phenomena at volcanoes that potentially pose a threat to life. After completing his research at Mount St. Helens, Voight began analyzing the volcanic hazards from several other active volcanoes.

In 1985, Voight blamed human error for the <a href="Armero%20tragedy">Armero tragedy</a> in Colombia, where more than 23,000 died from an eruption from the <a href="Nevado%20del%20Ruiz">Nevado del Ruiz</a> volcano. He stated that while categorically accurate predictions of volcanic eruptions were impossible, unpreparedness for the disaster exacerbated the death toll. In January 1986, Voight visited Nevado del Ruiz responding to concerns from the Colombian government that the northeastern section of the volcano might cave in, causing another eruption. He established a monitoring network of <a href="Reflection%20seismology">reflectors</a> and used <a href="Laser%20rangefinder">laser ranging</a> to track how the distances to these reflectors changed over time.

When one reflector indicated significant movement, and large cracks became visible from the air, Voight contemplated initiating an evacuation, but waited. By March 1986, he realized the widening cracks were caused by the <a href="Creep%20%28deformation%29">creep</a>, or gradual shifting, of one of the volcano's glaciers, rather than rock movement. After leaving Colombia, Voight compiled the 14-page report "Countdown to Catastrophe" (1988), which analyzed how volcanic hazard management had failed at Armero.

When Voight began research at <a href="Mount%20Merapi">Mount Merapi</a> in <a href="Java%2C%20Indonesia">Java, Indonesia</a>, in 1988, it was largely unknown to volcanologists. It had been omitted in the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>'s 1981 publication "Volcanoes of the World", despite being densely populated, having close to a million people on its slopes as of 1996. Voight set up meters to record movement within the volcano, and educated local scientists on volcanic monitoring. In July 1989, he obtained a $250,000 grant from the <a href="National%20Science%20Foundation">National Science Foundation</a>'s Division of Natural and Manmade Hazard Mitigation for his proposal to predict eruptions at Merapi.

After his funding ran out, he temporarily abandoned his research. An eruption from the volcano in 1994 produced <a href="pyroclastic%20flow">pyroclastic flow</a>s that killed 63 people, including guests at a wedding ceremony. Returning to Merapi the following year, Voight compared data from the dead and survivors, including the extent of their burn areas, clothing worn, and lung damage. He concluded that protective, long-sleeved clothing and masks enhance chances of survival when exposed to eruptive activity.

In April 1989, Voight returned to Colombia to the volcano <a href="Galeras">Galeras</a> after being contacted by the <a href="United%20Nations%20Office%20for%20the%20Coordination%20of%20Humanitarian%20Affairs">United Nations Disaster Relief Organization</a>. People in <a href="Pasto%2C%20Colombia">Pasto</a>, located at the foot of the volcano, had become alarmed by noises and shaking from Galeras. While Galeras proved far easier to climb than Nevado del Ruiz, land mines planted to hinder <a href="Guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla</a> forces dotted the slopes of the mountain. With USGS geologist Dick Janda, Voight drew a <a href="hazard%20map">hazard map</a> that included several populated areas within the danger zone. Before Voight left Galeras, the volcano underwent an unexpected <a href="phreatic%20eruption">phreatic eruption</a>, which Voight and his team failed to predict.

Although Pasto was unaffected, six scientists attending a United Nations workshop for natural disaster relief were killed. After reviewing <a href="Deformation%20%28engineering%29">deformation</a> data from the day before the eruption, Voight discovered that no acceleration in the deformation process had occurred. He surmised that phreatic eruptions do not exhibit an acceleration in deformation before taking place and left after confirming that the volcano's monitoring system functioned properly.

In the early 1990s, Voight performed volcanic hazard assessments at <a href="Cotopaxi">Cotopaxi</a> in Ecuador]l and at <a href="Nevado%20del%20Huila">Nevado del Huila</a> in Colombia, where his research was impeded by guerrilla factions and <a href="Illegal%20drug%20trade%20in%20Colombia">drug cartel</a> operations. He also assisted with assessment activity at <a href="Mount%20Pinatubo">Mount Pinatubo</a> in the Philippines, <a href="Mount%20Redoubt">Mount Redoubt</a> in the United States, <a href="Mount%20Bandai">Mount Bandai</a>, <a href="Mount%20Unzen">Mount Unzen</a>, and <a href="Mount%20Ontake">Mount Ontake</a> in Japan, and <a href="Bezymianny">Bezymianny</a> and <a href="Shiveluch">Shiveluch</a> in the <a href="Kamchatka%20Peninsula">Kamchatka Peninsula</a>, Russia.

Voight's successful prediction that an avalanche at St. Helens could provoke a <a href="lateral%20eruption">lateral eruption</a>, an eruption from the volcano's flank rather than its summit, attracted the attention of the government of <a href="Montserrat">Montserrat</a> in March 1996. Worried about an expanding <a href="lava%20dome">lava dome</a> at the <a href="Soufri%C3%A8re%20Hills">Soufrière Hills</a> volcano, the island's government asked Voight to assess its potential for an avalanche that could generate an eruption. Voight thought it was unlikely that the crater would collapse, but expressed concern over a possible pyroclastic flow that could reach the city of <a href="Plymouth%2C%20Montserrat">Plymouth</a> in approximately three minutes. The city and a village on the mountain were evacuated, and within three years, pyroclastic flows overtook the abandoned sites.

Following these eruptions, Voight served as a member of the Risk Assessment Panel that advised Montserrat's government, and he co-established the Caribbean Andesite Lava Island Precision Seismo-geodetic Observatory (CALIPSO) with a team of international scientists. He continued research at the island with Steven Sparks, a geoscientist at the <a href="University%20of%20Bristol">University of Bristol</a>, establishing the SEA-CALIPSO system to analyze Soufrière Hills by using <a href="seismic%20wave">seismic wave</a>s and explosions in the ocean. Among other findings, this effort detected a major <a href="fault%20%28geology%29">fault</a> trending north-to-west under Montserrat's western side. Voight still oversees hazard assessments at the volcano, providing his input during eruptive periods in 2006 and 2010.

With his students, Voight has analyzed pyroclastic flows, volcanically induced seismicity, volcanic debris avalanches, and volcanic eruption prediction. Voight has also served as a consultant geotechnical engineer for dams, tunnels, and nuclear power plants, helping plan engineering projects in France, India, Ireland, Somalia, <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>, Canada, and Turkey, as well as in the United States. Voight's research interests in lava dome collapses, <a href="stratovolcano">stratovolcano</a>es, monitoring of active volcanoes, and pyroclastic flows have brought him to Iceland, Indonesia, the West Indies, Italy, and Chile.

Combining his knowledge of engineering and geological concepts, Voight developed the widely used anelastic strain recovery (ASR) method for measuring <a href="Stress%20%28mechanics%29">stress</a> on deep rock. With a team of geologists, he also derived the material failure forecast method (FFM), which predicts eruption times for volcanoes based on changes in the mountain's surrounding seismic and deformation data. He currently serves as a member of the United States Geological Survey's Volcano Hazards Response Team, and has responded to potentially eruptive volcanoes in Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Chile.

Throughout his career, Voight has received multiple accolades and citations for his research as a professor and for his professional work as a geologist and volcanologist. In 1984, the <a href="Institution%20of%20Civil%20Engineers">Institution of Civil Engineers</a> awarded him the George Stephenson Medal, recognizing one of his articles as among "the best work published in [their] journals".

The same year, Voight earned an award for "significant original contribution to research in rock mechanics" from the United States National Committee on Rock Mechanics. For his help monitoring the <a href="Mayon">Mayon</a> Volcano in the Philippines in 1985, he was granted a key to <a href="Legazpi%2C%20Albay">Legazpi, Albay</a>, which had been threatened by Mayon's impending eruption. 1989 saw another major year of honors for Voight, as he was named a <a href="Macquarie%20University">MacQuarie</a> Research Scholar and again garnered an award from the United States National Committee on Rock Mechanics for his original findings. Voight has appeared as a distinguished lecturer several times, including at the <a href="University%20of%20Utah">University of Utah</a>'s College of Mining Engineering (1990), the University of California, Santa Barbara (1992), and the <a href="Association%20of%20Environmental%20%26amp%3B%20Engineering%20Geologists">Association of Environmental & Engineering Geologists</a> (1992).

For his service as a professor at Penn State, Voight has been given two awards, specifically for his research. In 1990, he received the Wilson Research Award from the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences for excellence in research. In 1991, he gained a Faculty Scholar Medal for "Outstanding Achievement in the Physical Sciences and Engineering". In 2008, Voight was appointed a Union Fellow of the <a href="American%20Geophysical%20Union">American Geophysical Union</a> for "fundamental contributions to the understanding of volcano deformation, assessment of volcano hazards, and forecasting", and the following year, he was awarded the Schuster Medal by the Canadian Geotechnical Society for "outstanding achievements in research on geologic hazards in North America". For "his research, teaching and consulting work", the Engineering Geology Division of the <a href="Geological%20Society%20of%20America">Geological Society of America</a> presented him with their 2010 Distinguished Practice Award.

Voight received the <a href="Thorarinsson%20Medal">Thorarinsson Medal</a> of the <a href="International%20Association%20of%20Volcanology%20and%20Chemistry%20of%20the%20Earth%27s%20Interior">International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior</a> in 2013, granted to a "scientist of outstanding distinction who has made fundamental contributions to research in volcanology", and in 2017 he was elected as a Member of the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Engineering">National Academy of Engineering</a> for "contributions to the understanding, management, and mitigation of geologic hazards."

Recalling a conference where Voight appeared, <a href="Bill%20McGuire%20%28volcanologist%29">Bill McGuire</a>, Emeritus Professor of Geophysical & Climate Hazards at <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a>, described him as "an illustrious expert on volcano instability and landslides".

Citing Voight for his Distinguished Practice Award, colleague Richard Gray named him among his "profession's brightest and productive members". When Voight published his failure forecast prediction mechanism, USGS geologist Robert I. Tilling praised it as "a significant refinement in the interpretation of monitoring data".

According to Voight's <a href="curriculum%20vitae">curriculum vitae</a> from Pennsylvania State University, he has published more than 400 papers or abstracts and edited 15 books, and his works have been cited more than 9,000 times. In addition to journal articles, Voight has written or helped write at least 21 books and <a href="monograph">monograph</a>s since 1965; his co-authors include R.S.J. Sparks, A. Neri, D. Elsworth, A. Belousov, and G. Mattioli. His most recent book, "The Eruption of Soufrière Hills Volcano, Montserrat from 2000 to 2010", was published in 2014. He continues to publish articles, according to his <a href="Google%20Scholar">Google Scholar</a> profile.

James Wood Bush

James Wood Bush ( – April 24, 1906) was an American <a href="Union%20Navy">Union Navy</a> sailor of <a href="British%20people">British</a> and <a href="Native%20Hawaiians">Native Hawaiian</a> descent. He was among a group of more than one hundred Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, at a time when the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii">Kingdom of Hawaii</a> was still an independent nation.

Enlisting in the Union Navy in 1864, Bush served as a sailor aboard the <a href="USS%20Vandalia%20%281828%29">USS "Vandalia"</a> and the captured Confederate vessel <a href="USS%20Beauregard%20%281861%29">USS "Beauregard"</a>, which maintained the <a href="Union%20blockade">blockade</a> of the ports of the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>. He was discharged from service in 1865 after an injury, which developed into a chronic condition in later life. The impoverished Bush was unable to return to Hawaii for more than a decade, during which time he traveled through <a href="New%20England">New England</a> and much of the Pacific. Back in Hawaii, he worked as a government tax collector and road supervisor for the island of <a href="Kauai">Kauai</a>, where he settled down. In later life he converted to <a href="Mormonism">Mormonism</a> and became an active member of the <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints%20in%20Hawaii">Hawaiian Mission</a>. After the annexation of Hawaii to the United States, Bush was recognized for his military service, and in 1905 was granted a government pension for the injuries he received in the Navy. He died at his home on Kauai on April 24, 1906.

For a long period after the Civil War, the legacy and contributions of Bush and other documented Hawaiian participants were largely forgotten except in the private circles of descendants and historians. There has been a revival of interest, especially through the efforts of his great-grandniece Edna Bush Ellis and others in the Hawaiian community. In 2010, the "Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War" were commemorated with a bronze plaque erected along the memorial pathway at the <a href="National%20Memorial%20Cemetery%20of%20the%20Pacific">National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific</a> in <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>.

James Wood Bush was born in <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>. The date of his birth is uncertain; sources claim it to be October 1844, 1845, or 1847–1848.
He was the son of George Henry Bush (1807–1853), a native of <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>, England, who went to Hawaii in 1825, and his Hawaiian wife.
Bush was thus of mixed <a href="Native%20Hawaiian">Native Hawaiian</a> and <a href="Caucasian%20race">Caucasian</a> descent, known as "<a href="hapa">hapa haole</a>" in <a href="Hawaiian%20language">Hawaiian</a>, although in his lifetime he was referred to as a "<a href="half-caste">half-caste</a>". His older brother was <a href="John%20E.%20Bush%20%28politician%29">John Edward Bush</a>, who became a newspaper publisher and politician, serving as <a href="Governors%20of%20Kauai">royal governor of Kauaʻi</a> and a cabinet minister under the reign of King <a href="Kal%C4%81kaua">Kalākaua</a>. Little is known about Bush's life before 1864. Like his brother, he began his career as a sailor working on either merchant or whaling ships in the Pacific. Hawaiian sailors were highly regarded in the 18th- and 19th-century maritime industry.

After the outbreak of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii">Kingdom of Hawaiʻi</a> under King <a href="Kamehameha%20IV">Kamehameha IV</a> declared its neutrality on August 26, 1861. Some Native Hawaiians and Hawaiian-born Americans (mainly descendants of American missionaries) both abroad and in the islands volunteered to enlist in the military regiments of various states in the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> and the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>. Individual Native Hawaiians had been serving in the United States Navy and Army since the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, and more served during the Civil War. Many Hawaiians sympathized with the Union because of Hawaiʻi's ties to <a href="New%20England">New England</a> through its missionaries and the whaling industries, and the ideological opposition of many to the institution of <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a>.
Arriving in New England at the beginning of the war, Bush enlisted at <a href="Portsmouth%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Portsmouth</a>, <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, for a three-year term as an "ordinary seaman" on September 27, 1864. During his service, he worked on the <a href="USS%20Vandalia%20%281828%29">USS "Vandalia"</a> and later the captured Confederate vessel <a href="USS%20Beauregard%20%281861%29">USS "Beauregard"</a>, which chased <a href="blockade%20runner">blockade runner</a>s off West Florida as part of the <a href="Atlantic%20Blockading%20Squadron">squadrons</a> responsible for maintaining the <a href="Union%20blockade">blockade</a> of the ports of the Confederacy. He developed chronic <a href="laryngitis">laryngitis</a> and spinal injuries due to his service in the Union Navy and was discharged in September 1865 at the <a href="Brooklyn%20Naval%20Hospital">Brooklyn Naval Hospital</a>. When the war ended, the impoverished Bush had no way of returning to Hawaii. For the next decade, he lived in <a href="New%20Bedford">New Bedford</a>, <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, and <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a>, finally returning to Hawaii in 1877. In 1905, after Hawaii became a US territory, Bush was granted a pension for his service in the Civil War, with back pensions dating from May 8, 1897.

After returning to Hawaii, Bush settled on the island of <a href="Kauai">Kauai</a>. In 1880, he was listed as the tax collector of Kawaihau, Kauai. In 1882, his older brother, in his capacity as Minister of Interior, appointed Bush the Road Supervisor for the District of Hanalei to replace Christian Bertlemann, who had resigned. In 1887, Bush converted to <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints%20in%20Hawaii">Mormonism</a> and was ordained an elder after two years, undertaking missionary work in the islands. He became the <a href="Bishop%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">bishop</a> of the Latter-day Saints <a href="Ward%20%28LDS%20Church%29">ward</a> in Kealia and hosted Mormon historian <a href="Andrew%20Jenson">Andrew Jenson</a> during his 1895 visit to Kauai. In around 1894, Bush married a young girl at <a href="Lahaina">Lahaina</a>, traveling to <a href="Kona%20District%2C%20Hawaii">Kona</a> after their marriage.
Bush died of <a href="heart%20failure">heart failure</a> at <a href="Kealia%2C%20Hawaii">Kealia</a>, Kauai, on April 24, 1906. In the last years of his life, he was a janitor at the Kealia prison. He was survived by his wife and son. Lorenzo Taylor, writing for the "<a href="Deseret%20News">Deseret News</a>" shortly after Bush's death, said, "[H]e has taken an active part in the missionary work, doing much good among his fellow men. He has also been very kind to the elders, and his doors were always open to them. He was greatly beloved and respected by all who knew him. His life was a noble example of faithful and untiring devotion to the Gospel." Bush is believed to be buried on Kauai, but the location of his grave is uncertain. According to Anita Manning, an Associate in Cultural Studies at <a href="Bishop%20Museum">Bishop Museum</a>, "even the family can't find him".

After the war, the military service of Hawaiians, including James Wood Bush and many others, was largely forgotten, disappearing from the collective memories of the American Civil War and the history of Hawaii. Hawaiian residents, historians, and descendants of Hawaiian combatants in the conflict have insisted on the need to remember the legacy of the Hawaiians who fought. Renewed interest in the stories of these individuals and this particular period of Hawaiian-American history has inspired efforts to preserve the memories of the Hawaiians who served in the war.

Stating that "our boys from Hawaii" should be remembered, Bush's great-grandniece Edna Bush Ellis was influential in reviving interest and in the effort to install a memorial recognizing their legacy. On August 26, 2010, on the anniversary of the signing of the Hawaiian Neutrality Proclamation, a bronze plaque was erected along the memorial pathway at the <a href="National%20Memorial%20Cemetery%20of%20the%20Pacific">National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific</a> in Honolulu recognizing the "Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War", the more than one hundred Hawaiians who were documented as serving during the American Civil War for both the Union and the Confederacy. As of 2014, researchers have identified 119 documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants from historical records. The exact number still remains unclear because many Hawaiians enlisted and served under Anglicized names, and little is known about them due to the lack of detailed records.

In 2015, the sesquicentennial of the end of the American Civil War, the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> released the publication "Asians and Pacific Islanders and the Civil War" about the service of the many combatants of Asian and Pacific Islander descent who fought during the war. The history of Hawaii's involvement and the biographies of Bush and others were written by historians Anita Manning, Justin Vance and others.

Æthelstan A

Æthelstan A () is the name given by historians to an unknown <a href="scribe">scribe</a> who drafted <a href="charter">charter</a>s (or diplomas), by which the king made grants of land, for King <a href="%C3%86thelstan">Æthelstan</a> of England between 928 and 935. They are an important source for historians as they provide far more information than other charters of the period, showing the date and place of the grant, and having an unusually long list of witnesses, including Welsh kings and occasionally <a href="List%20of%20Scottish%20monarchs">kings of</a> <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Strathclyde">Strathclyde</a>.

The Æthelstan A charters commence shortly after King Æthelstan conquered Northumbria in 927, making him the first king to rule the whole of England. The diplomas give the king titles such as "King of the English" and "King of the Whole of Britain", and this is seen by historians as part of a rhetoric which reflected his master's claim for a new status, higher than previous West Saxon kings.

The diplomas are written in elaborate Latin known as the "<a href="hermeneutic%20style">hermeneutic style</a>", which became dominant in Anglo-Latin literature from the mid-tenth century and a hallmark of the <a href="English%20Benedictine%20Reform">English Benedictine Reform</a>. Scholars vary widely in their views of his style, which has been described as "pretentious" and "almost impenetrable", but also as "poetic" and "as enduringly fascinating as it is complex".

Æthelstan A ceased to draft charters after 935, and his successors returned to a simpler style, suggesting that he was working on his own rather than being a member of a royal scriptorium.

After the death of <a href="Bede">Bede</a> in 735, Latin prose in England declined. It reached its lowest level in the ninth century, when few books and charters were produced, and they were of poor quality. King Æthelstan's grandfather, <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a> (871–899), embarked on an extensive programme to improve learning, and by the 890s the standard of Latin in charters was improving. Few charters survive from the reigns of Alfred and his son, <a href="Edward%20the%20Elder">Edward the Elder</a> (899–924), and none from 909 to 925. Until then, charters had generally been plain legal documents, and King Æthelstan's early diplomas were similar.

Until about 900, diplomas appear to have been drawn up in varying traditions and circumstances, but in later Anglo-Saxon times (c. 900–1066) charters can be more clearly defined. According to <a href="Simon%20Keynes">Simon Keynes</a>:
In this period, a diploma can be characterised as a formal and symbolic record, in Latin, of an occasion when the king, acting in a royal assembly, and with the consent of the ecclesiastical and secular orders, created an estate of "bookland" at a specified place, and conveyed it on the privileged terms defined by the "book", or diploma, to a named beneficiary. This act of establishing a particular estate as bookland, so that it could be held henceforth on these privileged terms, could be performed only by the king, in a royal assembly; but the diploma itself served hereafter as the title-deed for the land in question. It established that the land was to be held, with its appurtenances, free from the imposition of worldly burdens, with the exception of military service, bridge-work and fortress-work, and with the power to give it to anyone of its owner's choosing.

In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries there was a debate among historians as to whether late Anglo-Saxon charters were produced by a royal chancery or by monasteries on behalf of beneficiaries. In the 1910s, <a href="W.%20H.%20Stevenson">W. H. Stevenson</a> argued that charters in different areas of England were drawn up by the same hand, which would be unlikely if they were drawn up locally, supporting the case that the writers were royal clerks. The German scholar Richard Drögereit followed this up in 1935 by examining original charters between 931 and 963, and identified three scribes from their handwriting, whom he called Æthelstan A, Æthelstan C and Edmund C. Other charters which only existed in copies he allocated to these and other scribes on the basis of their style. In 2002 Keynes listed twenty "Æthelstan A" charters, of which two are original and the rest copies.

The boundary clauses of the Æthelstan A charters were written in correct <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a>, so it is unlikely that he was of foreign origin. The witness lists of the Æthelstan A charters consistently place Bishop <a href="%C3%86lfwine%20of%20Lichfield">Ælfwine</a> of <a href="Lichfield">Lichfield</a> in Mercia in a higher position than his rank warranted. King Æthelstan was probably brought up in Mercia, and in <a href="Sarah%20Foot">Sarah Foot</a>'s view he was probably intimate with Ælfwine before King Edward's death; as Ælfwine disappeared from the witness lists at the same time as the Æthelstan A charters ended, she suggests that he may have been Æthelstan A. Keynes thinks it more likely Æthelstan A was a king's priest from Mercia, who acquired his learning in a Mercian religious house and respected Ælfwine as a fellow Mercian; that Æthelstan A entered Æthelstan's service before he became king and was in permanent attendance on him. David Woodman also considers a Mercian origin likely, pointing out that some Mercian ninth-century charters have borrowings from <a href="Aldhelm">Aldhelm</a>, an important source of Æthelstan A's style. Woodman also puts forward the alternative idea that Æthelstan A had a connection with <a href="Glastonbury%20Abbey">Glastonbury Abbey</a> in <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a>, which appears to have been a centre of learning at this time, and certainly housed many of the texts which informed Æthelstan A's idiosyncratic Latin style.

The first charter produced by Æthelstan A in 928 described the king as "rex Anglorum", "king of the English", the first time that title had been used. By 931 he had become "king of the English, elevated by the right hand of the Almighty to the throne of the whole kingdom of Britain". Some charters were witnessed by Welsh kings, and occasionally by the kings of Scotland and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Strathclyde">Strathclyde</a>, signifying acceptance of Æthelstan's lordship. In Keynes's view, it cannot be a coincidence that the charters commenced immediately after the conquest of Northumbria, and Æthelstan A's primary aim was to display the "grandeur of Æthelstan's kingship". Foot argues that the king's inner circle quickly seized on the potential of the conquest for "ideological aggrandizement of the king's public standing". To Keynes, the diplomas "are symbolic of a monarchy invigorated by success, developing the pretensions commensurate with its actual achievements and clothing itself in the trappings of a new political order." He sees the fifty years from 925 to 975 as "the golden age of the Anglo-Saxon royal diploma".

Before 928 charters had been produced in various ways, sometimes by royal priests, sometimes by other priests on behalf of the beneficiaries. Æthelstan A was solely responsible for the production of charters between 928 and 934. King Æthelstan thus took unprecedented control over an important part of his functions. In 935 Æthelstan A shared the work with other scribes, and he then apparently retired. His charters have exceptionally long witness lists, with 101 names for a grant by the king to his <a href="thegn">thegn</a> Wulfgar at <a href="Lifton%2C%20Devon">Lifton</a> in Devon in 931, and 92 for a grant to Ælfgar at <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a> in 934. The witness lists of King Æthelstan's father and grandfather were much shorter, with the longest in Alfred the Great's reign having only 19 names. In <a href="John%20Maddicott">John Maddicott</a>'s view the long lists in Æthelstan's reign reflect a change of direction to larger assemblies. The king established a novel system, with his scribe travelling with him from meeting to meeting, and a uniform format of charters. The dating clause showed the <a href="regnal%20year">regnal year</a>, the <a href="indiction">indiction</a>, the <a href="epact">epact</a>, and the age of the moon. In Keynes's view: "Nothing quite like them had been seen before; and they must have seemed magnificent, even intimidating, in their formality and their grandeur." A unique feature is that three charters in favour of a religious community require it to sing a specified number of psalms for the king, indicating a particular interest in <a href="psalmody">psalmody</a> by the king or scribe.

Frankish annalists usually recorded a king's location at Easter and Christmas, but this was not a practice of English chroniclers, and the only period in the tenth and eleventh centuries for which historians can construct a partial itinerary of the king's movements is provided by the location of assemblies recorded in Æthelstan A's charters of 928 to 935. Other charters rarely named the place of assembly, apart from a group in the 940s and early 950s known as the "alliterative" charters.

In 935 a new simplified format was introduced by other scribes, apparently while Æthelstan A was still active, and became the standard until the late 950s. This coincided with the disappearance of <a href="Wulfstan%20%28died%20956%29">Wulfstan I</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a> from the witness lists, and greater prominence of the Bishops of <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">London</a> and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>, and the new format may have reflected a change of outlook at court. As charters were no longer written in his distinctive style when he ceased producing them, it is likely he was working on his own rather than heading a royal scriptorium.

The standard of Latin prose improved in the tenth century, especially after about 960, when the leaders of the Benedictine reform movement adopted the elaborate and ornate style of Latin now called by historians the "hermeneutic style". Use of this style, influenced especially by Aldhelm's "De virginitate", dates back to King Æthelstan's reign. Æthelstan A borrowed heavily from Aldhelm; he would not copy whole sentences, only a word or a few words, incorporating them in a structure reminiscent of Aldhelm's works. In Woodman's view, "Æthelstan A" varied the language in each charter out of a delight in experimentation and to demonstrate his literary ability.

The florid style of seventh-century Irish texts known as Hiberno-Latin was influential on the Continent due to the work of Irish missionaries in Europe. Some works were known to English writers such as Aldhelm in the same century, but it is likely that Æthelstan A learnt of them from continental scholars such as <a href="Israel%20the%20Grammarian">Israel the Grammarian</a>, who brought texts influenced by Hiberno-Latin to King Æthelstan's court.

Woodman states that: "whilst it is true that the main impetus for the literary revival of Latin prose occurred from the mid-tenth century, the beginnings of this style of Latin can actually be found rather earlier and in the most unlikely of places. In fact it is "diplomas" of the 920s and 930s that are the first to display this distinctive Latin in its most exuberant form." According to Scott Thompson Smith Æthelstan A's diplomas "are generally characterised by a rich <a href="pleonastic">pleonastic</a> style with aggressively literary <a href="proem">proem</a>s and anathemas, ostentatious language and imagery throughout, decorative rhetorical figures, elaborate dating clauses, and extensive witness lists. These are clearly documents with stylistic ambitions." Few listeners would have understood them when they were read out at royal assemblies. In Charter S 425 of 934, the second of the two originals to survive, Æthelstan A wrote (in Smith's translation):
The wanton fortune of the deceiving world, not lovely with the milky-white radiance of unfading lilies but odious with the galling bitterness of woeful corruption, raging with venomous jaws tears with its teeth the sons of fetid flesh in the vale of tears; although with its smiles it may be alluring to the unfortunate, it brazenly leads down to the lowest depths of <a href="Acherontic">Acherontic</a> <a href="Cocytus">Cocytus</a> unless <a href="Jesus">the offspring</a> of <a href="God%20the%20Father">the High-Thunderer</a> should intervene. And so because that ruinous [fortune] mortally fades away in its failing, one must especially hasten to pleasant fields of ineffable joy where the angelic music of hymnal jubilation and the mellifluous scent of blooming roses are sensed as sweet beyond measure by good and blessed noses and heard by ears as the delights of musical instrument without end.

In S 416 of 931, the first original to survive, after the boundary clause in Old English, he reverted to Latin for the anathema against anyone who set aside the charter:
If, however, God forbid, anyone swollen with diabolic spirit should be tempted to diminish or annul this brief document of my arrangement and confirmation, let him know that on the final and great day of judgment, when the archangel's shrill trumpet rings out, when graves burst open by themselves and give up the bodies now revived, when every element trembles, with the traitor Judas, who is called "son of perdition" by the Sower's merciful Offspring, he is to perish in eternal confusion within the hungry flames of unspeakable torments.

Some scholars are not impressed. <a href="Michael%20Lapidge">Michael Lapidge</a> describes Æthelstan A's style as "pretentious", and according to Mechtild Gretsch the diplomas
are composed in almost impenetrable Latin. Their proems consist of long convoluted sentences, parading an ostentatious display of Greek and glossary-based vocabulary and containing numerous unmistakable verbal reminiscences of Aldhelm's writings. Nothing similar had previously been attempted in Anglo-Saxon diplomatic and although, later in the tenth century, other charters affecting the hermeneutic style were composed, the ferocious lexical and syntactical difficulties of these Æthelstan charters were never to be surpassed.

On the other hand, Drögereit describes Æthelstan A's style as having a "poetic quality", and Woodman describes him as an "author of no little genius, a man who not only overhauled the legal form of the diploma but also had the ability to write Latin that is as enduringly fascinating as it is complex." In Woodman's view: "Never before had the royal diploma's rhetorical properties been exploited to such a degree and it seems no coincidence that these documents appeared following King Æthelstan's momentous political conquest of the north in 927."

Keynes listed the Æthelstan A charters in Table XXVII of his "Atlas of Attestations". The charters are in the script called "Square minuscule ('Phase II')", with a Latin text and the boundary clause in the vernacular.

Elliott Fitch Shepard

Elliott Fitch Shepard (July 25, 1833 – March 24, 1893) was a New York lawyer, banker, and owner of the "<a href="Mail%20and%20Express">Mail and Express</a>" newspaper, as well as a founder and president of the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Bar%20Association">New York State Bar Association</a>. Shepard was married to <a href="Margaret%20Louisa%20Vanderbilt">Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt</a>, who was the granddaughter of philanthropist, business magnate, and family patriarch <a href="Cornelius%20Vanderbilt">Cornelius Vanderbilt</a>. Shepard's <a href="Briarcliff%20Manor">Briarcliff Manor</a> residence <a href="Woodlea">Woodlea</a> and the <a href="Scarborough%20Presbyterian%20Church">Scarborough Presbyterian Church</a>, which he founded nearby, are contributing properties to the <a href="Scarborough%20Historic%20District">Scarborough Historic District</a>.

Shepard was born in <a href="Jamestown%2C%20New%20York">Jamestown, New York</a>, one of three sons of the president of a banknote-engraving company. He attended the <a href="City%20University%20of%20New%20York">City University of New York</a>, and practiced law for about 25 years. During the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, Shepard was a <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> recruiter and subsequently earned the rank of <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a>. He was later a founder and benefactor of several institutions and banks. When Shepard moved to the Briarcliff Manor hamlet of <a href="Scarborough-on-Hudson">Scarborough-on-Hudson</a>, he founded the Scarborough Presbyterian Church and built Woodlea; the house and its land are now part of <a href="Sleepy%20Hollow%20Country%20Club">Sleepy Hollow Country Club</a>.

Shepard was born July 25, 1833 in <a href="Jamestown%2C%20New%20York">Jamestown</a> in <a href="Chautauqua%20County%2C%20New%20York">Chautauqua County, New York</a>. He was the second of three sons of Fitch Shepard and Delia Maria Dennis; the others were Burritt Hamilton and Augustus Dennis. Fitch Shepard was president of the National Bank Note Company (later <a href="Consolidation%20%28business%29">consolidated</a> with the American and Continental Note Companies), and Elliott's brother Augustus became president of the <a href="American%20Bank%20Note%20Company">American Bank Note Company</a>. Shepard's extended family lived in New England, with origins in <a href="Bedfordshire%2C%20England">Bedfordshire, England</a>. Fitch, son of Noah Shepard, was a descendant of <a href="Thomas%20Shepard%20%28minister%29">Thomas Shepard</a> (a <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> minister) and James Fitch (son-in-law of <a href="William%20Bradford%20%28Plymouth%20soldier%29">William Bradford</a>). Delia Maria Dennis was a descendant of Robert Dennis, who emigrated from England in 1635. Elliott was described in 1897's "Prominent Families of New York" as "prominent by birth and ancestry, as well as for his personal qualities". He attended public schools in Jamestown, and moved with his father and brothers to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> in 1845. He began attending the college-preparatory University Grammar School (then located in the <a href="City%20University%20of%20New%20York">City University of New York</a> building), and graduated from the university in 1855. Shepard began <a href="reading%20law">reading law</a> under <a href="Edwards%20Pierrepont">Edwards Pierrepont</a>, and was <a href="Admission%20to%20the%20bar%20in%20the%20United%20States">admitted</a> to the <a href="Bar%20%28law%29">bar</a> in the city of <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> in 1858.

From January 1861 through the outbreak of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> and until 1862 Shepard served as an "<a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a>" to <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> General <a href="Edwin%20D.%20Morgan">Edwin D. Morgan</a> with the rank of colonel. During this time Shepard was placed in command of the department of volunteers in <a href="Elmira%2C%20New%20York">Elmira</a>, and enlisted 47,000 men from the surrounding area. In 1862 he was appointed Assistant Inspector-General for half of New York state, reporting to New York's governor on troop organization, equipment, and discipline.

In 1862 he visited Jamestown to inspect, equip and provide uniforms for the Chautauqua regiment, his first return since infancy, and was welcomed by a group of prominent citizens. Shepard recruited and organized the 51st Regiment, New York Volunteers, which was named the Shepard Rifles in his honor. George W. Whitman, brother of the poet <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Walt Whitman</a> and a member of the regiment, was notified by Shepard of a promotion; Shepard may have influenced his subsequent promotion to <a href="major">major</a> in 1865. In addition, Shepard was involved in correspondence with Walt Whitman. Although President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> offered him a promotion to <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a>, Shepard declined in deference to officers who had seen field service; Shepard himself never entered the field. From 1866 to 1868 Shepard served as "aide-de-camp" to <a href="Reuben%20E.%20Fenton">Reuben E. Fenton</a>.

In 1864, Shepard was a member of the executive committee and chair of the Committee on Contributions from Without the City for the New York Metropolitan Fair. He chaired lawyers' committees for disaster relief, including those in <a href="Portland%2C%20Maine">Portland, Maine</a> and <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> after the <a href="1866%20Great%20fire%20of%20Portland%2C%20Maine">1866 Great Fire</a> and the 1871 <a href="Great%20Chicago%20Fire">Great Chicago Fire</a> respectively, and was a member of the municipal committee for victims of the 1889 <a href="Johnstown%20Flood">Johnstown Flood</a>.

In 1867 Shepard was presented to <a href="Margaret%20Louisa%20Vanderbilt">Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt</a> at a reception given by Governor Morgan; their difficult courtship was opposed by Margaret's father, <a href="William%20Henry%20Vanderbilt">William Henry Vanderbilt</a>. A year later, on February 18, 1868, they were married in the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Incarnation%2C%20Episcopal%20%28Manhattan%29">Church of the Incarnation</a> in New York City. After an 1868 trip to <a href="Tarsus%2C%20Mersin">Tarsus, Mersin</a> he helped found <a href="Tarsus%20American%20College">Tarsus American College</a>, agreeing to donate $5,000 a year to the school and leave it an endowment of $100,000 ($ in ). He became one of the school's trustees and vice presidents.

In 1868, Shepard became a partner of Judge <a href="Theron%20R.%20Strong">Theron R. Strong</a> in Strong & Shepard, continuing the business after Strong's death. He continued to practice law for the next 25 years; he helped found the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Bar%20Association">New York State Bar Association</a> in 1876, and in 1884 was its fifth president. In 1875 Shepard drafted an amendment establishing an arbitration court for the <a href="New%20York%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce">New York Chamber of Commerce</a>, serving on its five-member executive committee the following year. In 1880, the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Council">New York City Board of Aldermen</a> appointed Shepard and Ebenezer B. Shafer to revise and codify the city's <a href="local%20ordinances">local ordinances</a> to form the New-York Municipal Code; the last revision was in 1859.

During the 1880s he helped found three banks. At the <a href="Bank%20of%20the%20Metropolis">Bank of the Metropolis</a>, he was a founding board member. The others were the American Savings Bank and the Columbian National Bank, where he served as attorney. In 1881, US President <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> nominated him for <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20for%20the%20Southern%20District%20of%20New%20York">United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York</a>. In 1884, Shepard led the effort to create an arbitration court for the <a href="New%20York%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce">New York Chamber of Commerce</a>. On March 20, 1888, Shepard purchased the "<a href="Mail%20and%20Express">Mail and Express</a>" newspaper (founded in 1836, with an estimated value in 1888 of $200,000 ($ in ) from <a href="Cyrus%20W.%20Field">Cyrus W. Field</a> for $425,000 ($ in ). Deeply religious, Shepard placed a verse from the Bible at the head of each edition's editorial page. As president of the newspaper company until his death, he approved every important decision or policy. In the same year, Shepard became the controlling stockholder of the <a href="Fifth%20Avenue%20Transportation%20Company">Fifth Avenue Transportation Company</a> to force it to halt work on Sundays (the <a href="Christian%20Sabbath">Christian Sabbath</a>).

When Margaret's father died in 1885, she inherited $12 million ($ in ). The family lived at 2 West <a href="52nd%20Street">52nd Street</a> in Manhattan, one of three houses of the Vanderbilt <a href="Vanderbilt%20houses">Triple Palace</a> which were built during the 1880s for William Henry Vanderbilt and his two daughters. After Elliott's death Margaret transferred the house to her sister's family, who combined their two houses into one. The houses were eventually demolished; the nine-story <a href="De%20Pinna">De Pinna</a> Building was built there in 1928 and was demolished around 1969. <a href="650%20Fifth%20Avenue">650 Fifth Avenue</a> is the building currently on the site.

Shepard and his family toured the world in 1884, visiting Asia, Africa, and Europe. He documented his 1887 trip from New York to Alaska in "The Riva.: New York and Alaska" taken by himself, his wife and daughter, six other family members, their maid, a chef, butler, <a href="Porter%20%28carrier%29">porter</a> and conductor. According to Shepard, the family traveled on 26 railroads and stayed at 38 hotels in nearly five months. After the 1884 trip, aware of the opportunity for church work in the territory, he founded a mission and maintained it with his wife for about $20,000 ($ in ) a year. For some time Shepard worshiped at the <a href="Fifth%20Avenue%20Presbyterian%20Church">Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church</a> under John Hall, and was a vice president of the Presbyterian Union of New-York. Shepard was president of the American Sabbath Union for five years, and he also served as the chairman of the Special Committee on Sabbath Observance.

During the early 1890s Shepard moved to <a href="Scarborough-on-Hudson">Scarborough-on-Hudson</a> in present-day Briarcliff Manor, purchasing a <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian house</a> from J. Butler Wright. He had a mansion (named Woodlea, after Wright's house) built south of the house, facing the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a>, and improved its grounds. Construction of the mansion began in 1892, and was completed three years later. Shepard died in 1893, leaving Margaret to oversee its completion. The finished house has between , making it one of the <a href="List%20of%20largest%20houses%20in%20the%20United%20States">largest privately owned houses in the United States</a>.

After Shepard's death Margaret lived there in the spring and fall, with her visits becoming less frequent. By 1900 she began selling property to <a href="Frank%20A.%20Vanderlip">Frank A. Vanderlip</a> and <a href="William%20Rockefeller">William Rockefeller</a>, selling them the house in 1910. Vanderlip and Rockefeller assembled a board of directors to create a country club; they first met at Vanderlip's National City Bank Building office at <a href="55%20Wall%20Street">55 Wall Street</a> (Vanderlip was president of the bank at the time). Sleepy Hollow Country Club was founded, with Woodlea becoming its clubhouse and the J. Butler Wright house as its golf house.

Shepard established a small chapel on his Briarcliff Manor property, and founded the <a href="Scarborough%20Presbyterian%20Church">Scarborough Presbyterian Church</a> in 1892. The church and its <a href="manse">manse</a> were donated by Margaret after his death. It was designed by Augustus Haydel (a nephew of <a href="Stanford%20White">Stanford White</a>) and August D. Shepard Jr. (a nephew of Elliott Shepard and <a href="William%20Rutherford%20Mead">William Rutherford Mead</a>). The church, dedicated on May 11, 1895 in Shepard's memory, was briefly known as Shepard Memorial Church.

Shepard and Margaret had five daughters and one son: Florence (1869–1869), Maria Louise (1870–1948), Edith (1872–1954), Marguerite (1873–1895), <a href="Alice%20Vanderbilt%20Morris">Alice</a> (1874–1950) and <a href="Elliott%20Shepard">Elliott Jr.</a> (1877–1927). The children attended <a href="Sunday%20school">Sunday school</a> and church, and were educated by private tutors and <a href="governesses">governesses</a>. Shepard also employed a private chef for his family. Shepard was a strict father known to beat his son, who was described as being as wild as his father was rigid and moralizing.

Shepard was tall, with a pleasant expression and manner, and "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called him the "perfect type of well-bred clubman". He had thick hair, manicured nails, a well-trimmed beard and an athletic figure. An opponent of <a href="antisemitism">antisemitism</a>, he attended dinners publicizing the plight of Russian Jews and regularly addressed Jewish religious and social organizations avoided by others. He rented pews in many New York churches, supported about a dozen missionaries and was described as a generous donor to hospitals and charitable societies. Shepard was politically ambitious, and decided to build Woodlea as a symbol of power and influence. Shepard had horses and carriages which were ridden by the family in parks, and he prided himself on his <a href="equestrianism">equestrianism</a>. Shepard was a long-time friend of US Senator <a href="Chauncey%20Depew">Chauncey Depew</a>.

Shepard was a supporter of the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a>, contributing $75,000 ($ in ) to the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201888">1888 Presidential campaign</a> fund and $10,000 ($ in ) to the state committee for the <a href="Jacob%20Sloat%20Fassett">Fassett</a> campaign. He furnished Shepard Hall, at Sixth Avenue and 57th Street in New York City, offering it rent-free to the Republican Club.

Shepard belonged to a number of organizations: the <a href="Adirondack%20League%20Club">Adirondack League</a>, the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>, the <a href="American%20Oriental%20Society">American Oriental Society</a>, the <a href="Association%20of%20the%20Bar%20of%20the%20City%20of%20New%20York">Association of the Bar of the City of New York</a>, the <a href="Century%20Association">Century Association</a>, the Congregational Club, the Lawyers' Club of New York, the <a href="Manhattan%20Athletic%20Club">Manhattan Athletic Club</a>, the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Design">National Academy of Design</a>, the <a href="New%20England%20Society%20of%20New%20York">New England Society of New York</a>, the <a href="New%20York%20Athletic%20Club">New York Athletic Club</a>, the <a href="New%20York%20Press%20Club">New York Press Club</a>, the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Bar%20Association">New York State Bar Association</a>, the <a href="New%20York%20Yacht%20Club">New York Yacht Club</a>, the Presbyterian Union of New York, the Republican Club of the City of New York, the Riding Club, the <a href="Sons%20of%20the%20American%20Revolution">Sons of the American Revolution</a>, the <a href="Twilight%20Club">Twilight Club</a>, the <a href="Union%20League%20Club%20of%20New%20York">Union League Club of New York</a>, and the <a href="Union%20League">Union League</a> of Brooklyn.

In 1892, the City University of New York gave Shepard a <a href="Master%20of%20Laws">Master of Laws</a> degree and the <a href="University%20of%20Omaha">University of Omaha</a> gave him a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Laws">Doctor of Laws</a> degree. On January 11, 1893, Shepard addressed the House Committee on the <a href="Columbian%20Exposition">Columbian Exposition</a> in an effort to convince the committee not to open the exposition on a Sunday - the Sabbath. Shepard himself attended, having spent $25,000 ($ in ) on September 7, 1891 in reserving sixteen rooms with board at the <a href="Auditorium%20Building">Auditorium Hotel</a> for six months during the fair.

Shepard died unexpectedly during the afternoon of March 24, 1893 at his Manhattan residence. Two doctors were attempting to remove a <a href="bladder%20stone">bladder stone</a> from him. They instructed him to eat lightly, only well before the operation. They gave him the anesthetic <a href="Diethyl%20ether">ether</a> at 12:45 p.m. For a few minutes Shepard did not seem to react, though soon afterward his color started changing and his respiration and pulse dimmed, so administration of ether was stopped, however not enough ether was given to continue with the operation. His condition started to worsen again; the doctors suspected food or vomit was blocking his windpipe or bronchial tubes. The doctors then administered oxygen, which helped temporarily; however, at 4:00 p.m. his pulse became steadily more feeble, he fell unconscious, and died at 4:10 p.m. His cause of death was <a href="Pulmonary%20edema">edema</a> and congestion of the lungs, after the administration of ether, but due to an unknown cause.

Many doctors considered the case to be unusual and debated the cause of death. Some, including family members, accused them of criminal negligence; that Shepard was fed well before the operation, which could have allowed him to choke on vomit. No autopsy was made, but an inquest was made by the coroner. The two doctors to perform the operation made a statement on March 28, 1893 that after prior examinations no diseases were found and his heart and lungs seemed healthy. A "Tribune" reporter met doctor William J. Morton, son of possible ether discoverer <a href="William%20T.%20G.%20Morton">William T. G. Morton</a> who had first used it in 1846. Morton said it was most improbable Shepard died of ether, ensuring its safety when properly used, and that deaths were one in 25,000. He recommended an autopsy.

The first funeral service was a small gathering of pallbearers and close friends of the family at the house; then Shepard's body was moved to their church. From the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, Shepard was moved to <a href="Battery%20Park">the Battery</a> and then onto a ferry to Staten Island.

At the funeral, organizations that Shepard was part of sent representatives, including the Union League Club, the Republican County Committee, the Republican Club, the New York State Bar Association, the Presbyterian Union, the Chamber of Commerce, the American Sabbath Union, New York Sabbath Observance Committee, American Bible Society, St. Paul's Institute at Tarsus, the Union League of Brooklyn, the Republican Association of the 21st Assembly District, the Shepard Rifles, the New York Typothetae, the American Bank Note Company, the College of the City of New York, the "Mail and Express", and the New-York Press Club. Those at the funeral included <a href="Albert%20Bierstadt">Albert Bierstadt</a>, <a href="Noah%20Davis">Noah Davis</a>, <a href="Chauncey%20M.%20Depew">Chauncey M. Depew</a>, <a href="John%20S.%20Kennedy">John S. Kennedy</a>, <a href="John%20James%20McCook%20%28lawyer%29">John James McCook</a>, <a href="Warner%20Miller">Warner Miller</a>, <a href="John%20Sloane">John Sloane</a>, and <a href="John%20H.%20Starin">John H. Starin</a>. Notable family included his immediate family, as well as most of the living Vanderbilt family, including the majority of Margaret Louisa's siblings, their spouses, and Margaret Louisa's mother.
Shepard was first buried in the Vanderbilt mausoleum in <a href="Moravian%20Cemetery">Moravian Cemetery</a>. On November 17, 1894 one of his daughters, his wife, and her brother <a href="George%20Washington%20Vanderbilt%20II">George Vanderbilt</a> oversaw the transfer of his remains and those of his daughter Florence to a new Shepard family tomb in the cemetery nearby.

Shepard's estate included the $100,000 Tarsus American College endowment, $850,000 in real estate and $500,000 in personal property for a total of $1.35 million ($ in ). His will distributed money and property to his wife and children, his brother Augustus, and religious organizations. Shepard funded a number of scholarships and <a href="Prize%20money">prizes</a>, including one at the City University of New York and <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>'s annual Elliott F. Shepard Scholarship, and in 1888 he donated a large collection of books originally from lawyer <a href="Aaron%20J.%20Vanderpoel">Aaron J. Vanderpoel</a>'s library to the <a href="New%20York%20University%20School%20of%20Law">New York University School of Law</a>. A year later, Shepard created an endowment for periodicals, necessitating the creation of the university's first reading room. In 1897, Shepard's wife donated his 1,390-volume collection of law books to the library.

When the wife of Chicago publisher Horace O'Donoghue read him the news of Shepard's death four days after the event, he picked up a razor and slit his throat. Although his suicide was first thought to be impulsive, it was later learned that the likely cause was O'Donoghue's large debts to Chicago publishing houses.

Oriental Film

Oriental Film was a film production company in <a href="Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Batavia</a>, <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> (now <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>, Indonesia). Established by <a href="Chinese%20Indonesians">ethnic Chinese</a> businessman Tjo Seng Han in 1940, it completed four <a href="black-and-white">black-and-white</a> films before it was closed in 1941. All the company's films were screened into the 1950s but may now be <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>. They were directed by two men, <a href="Njoo%20Cheong%20Seng">Njoo Cheong Seng</a> and <a href="Sutan%20Usman%20Karim">Sutan Usman Karim</a>, and launched the careers of actors such as <a href="Dhalia">Dhalia</a> and <a href="Soerip">Soerip</a>.

Established during the revival of the Indies film industry, Oriental released its first film, "<a href="Kris%20Mataram">Kris Mataram</a>", in July 1940. It starred Njoo's wife <a href="Fifi%20Young">Fifi Young</a>, and relied on her fame as a stage actress to draw audiences. This was followed by a further three films, which were targeted at low-income audiences and extensively used "<a href="kroncong">kroncong</a>" music. Their final production was "<a href="Panggilan%20Darah">Panggilan Darah</a>" in 1941, which was completed after Njoo and Young had migrated to <a href="Majestic%20Film">Majestic Film</a>. Oriental was unable to recoup its expenses of renting a Dutch-owned studio, and the company was shut down.

Following the commercial successes of "<a href="Terang%20Boelan">Terang Boelan</a>" ("Full Moon"; 1937), "<a href="Fatima%20%281938%20film%29">Fatima</a>" (1938), and "<a href="Alang-Alang%20%28film%29">Alang-Alang</a>" ("Grass"; 1939), the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> film industry – which had been severely weakened by the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> – was revived. Film production increased and, in 1940, four new <a href="production%20house">production house</a>s were opened, including Oriental Film. Funded entirely by the <a href="Chinese%20Indonesians">ethnic Chinese</a> businessman Tjo Seng Han, the company's first headquarters were at 42 Matraman Street, in eastern <a href="Jakarta">Batavia</a> (now Jakarta); according to the weekly "Sin Po", this studio had simple facilities. Another ethnic Chinese businessman, Tjan Hock Siong, was brought on to manage the day-to-day activities of the studio.

Tjo and Tjan hired <a href="Njoo%20Cheong%20Seng">Njoo Cheong Seng</a>, a dramatist who had previously worked with the <a href="Miss%20Riboet%27s%20Orion">Orion Opera</a> before establishing his own troupe, and his wife <a href="Fifi%20Young">Fifi Young</a>. The two had gained wide recognition through their stage work, and it was hoped that name recognition would bring in audiences. The hiring of Njoo and Young was part of a trend of bringing theatrically trained actors and crew into the film industry. "Terang Boelan" had used stage starlet <a href="Roekiah">Roekiah</a> and her husband <a href="Kartolo">Kartolo</a> to great effect, and the actors had brought similar financial success to <a href="Tan%27s%20Film">Tan's Film</a> after they were hired.

Oriental's first production, "<a href="Kris%20Mataram">Kris Mataram</a>" ("Kris of Mataram"), was directed by Njoo and starred Young and Omar Rodriga. It followed a young noblewoman (played by Young) who marries a nobleman despite her parents' disapproval. For this film, Njoo drew <a href="Wong%20brothers">Joshua Wong</a> from Tan's as cinematographer, then used the Wong name as part of his advertising: "["Kris Mataram" has] the J. Wong guarantee". Released in July 1940, the film was targeted at low-income audiences – particularly theatre-goers who would recognise Young. A review in the "<a href="Soerabaijasch%20Handelsblad">Soerabaijasch Handelsblad</a>" praised it, calling "Kris Mataram" "captivating to the last metre".

Before its studio's second production, Oriental began renting the studios of Algemeen Nederlandsch Indisch Filmsyndicaat (ANIF) in Molenvliet, Batavia, for 1,500 <a href="Netherlands%20Indies%20gulden">gulden</a> a month. This rent also included access to the studio's equipment and cameraman J.J.W. Steffans, as well as facilities such as air conditioning and telephones in each office, and lighting equipment for night-time shots. A large adjacent plot of land was also included. By renting the ANIF complex, Oriental became the largest and most modern studio in the Indies.

Njoo soon showed a proclivity for sensation, which was manifested in the December 1940 release "<a href="Zoebaida">Zoebaida</a>". For the film, a love story set in <a href="Timor">Timor</a> starring Young as the title character, Oriental used bright, extravagant costumes; Njoo gave the characters whimsical names which would not be found in the setting. Rather than shoot on location – which would have been prohibitively expensive – Oriental constructed sets behind the ANIF Studio. Reviewers of the film noted with disdain that "Zoebaida" was exaggerated and clearly reflected its stage influences.

Oriental released its third production, "<a href="Pantjawarna">Pantjawarna</a>" ("Five Colours"), in March 1941. Again starring Young, the film – in which a young woman must raise two daughters despite her husband's imprisonment – featured two new hires, <a href="Dhalia">Dhalia</a> and <a href="Soerip">Soerip</a>. Both women, teenagers at the time, had established stage careers and were known for their singing voices, which were put to use in several of "Pantjawarna" twelve "<a href="kroncong">kroncong</a>" songs. This film was well received by critics, and Young's acting was praised in both the "<a href="Bataviaasch%20Nieuwsblad">Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad</a>" and "Soerabaijasch Handelsblad"; the latter characterised "Pantjawarna" as "a success for O.F.C. [Oriental Film Company] and proof of the progress made in the cinema of the Indies".

After "Pantjawarna", <a href="Fred%20Young%20%28director%29">Fred Young</a> drew Njoo and his wife to the newly established <a href="Majestic%20Film">Majestic Film</a>. Deprived of their director and main star, Oriental hired the journalist Sutan Usman Karim to direct their fourth production, "<a href="Panggilan%20Darah">Panggilan Darah</a>" ("Call of Blood"). This film, written by Karim and starring Dhalia and Soerip, told of two young orphans as they tried to eke a living in Batavia. This film, which debuted in June 1941, prominently featured the cigarette factory Nitisemito, leading the Indonesian film historian <a href="Misbach%20Yusa%20Biran">Misbach Yusa Biran</a> to suggest that it may have paid for the advertisement. He records it as a modest success, although he notes that reviews were mixed.

Following "Panggilan Darah", Oriental – which had been losing money steadily – released its contract for the ANIF studio, which was taken over by the Dutch-run Multi Film. Despite hopes that they would continue producing <a href="fictional%20film">narrative films</a>, perhaps with less modern equipment, the company was dissolved. Oriental's actors and crew members migrated to different studios. Suska was signed to Java Industrial Film and directed a single film for them, "<a href="Ratna%20Moetoe%20Manikam">Ratna Moetoe Manikam</a>". Dhalia went to Populair's Film and acted in one production, "<a href="Moestika%20dari%20Djemar">Moestika dari Djemar</a>" ("The Jewel of Djemar"; 1942), before the <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20the%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Japanese occupation</a> in March 1942 closed that studio. Soerip, meanwhile, joined Njoo and Young at Majestic Film, acting in two productions before that studio was closed.

Although Oriental was short-lived, several of the actors and crew it hired went on to lengthy careers. Njoo, after handling two films for Majestic in 1941, spent much of the decade in theatre before returning to directing in the mid-1950s. Fifi Young, who continued acting for Njoo until their divorce in 1945, appeared in more than eighty films before her death in 1975. Dhalia and Soerip likewise had lengthy careers: both acted until the 1990s, Dhalia in 52 productions and Soerip in 25.

In a period of two years, Oriental released four films; all were feature length, made in black-and-white, and received wide releases in the Dutch East Indies. Some, such as "Panggilan Darah", enjoyed international release; the film was screened in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> (then part of the <a href="Straits%20Settlements">Straits Settlements</a>) by September 1941. The company's productions were targeted at low-income audiences and extensively used "kroncong" music, for the recording of which the company established the Oriental Novelty Five. Though its films were screened at least into the 1950s, Oriental's output may be lost.

Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome was promoted as the "largest wrestling show in the world outside of the United States" and was the 24th <a href="January%204%20Tokyo%20Dome%20Show">January 4 Tokyo Dome Show</a>, although previous events were held under different names.

On August 10, 2014, NJPW made two announcements. Firstly, Wrestle Kingdom 9 would be held at the <a href="Tokyo%20Dome">Tokyo Dome</a> on January 4, 2015. Secondly, NJPW revealed a partnership with <a href="Jeff%20Jarrett">Jeff Jarrett</a>'s <a href="Global%20Force%20Wrestling%20%282014%E2%80%932017%29">Global Force Wrestling</a>, which it approached about bringing the event to a new market. On November 4, GFW announced that it would present the event live on American pay-per-view television and that it had a PPV market of 125 million homes.

The event was broadcast on American PPV as the first GFW event. The four-hour "GFW Presents New Japan Pro Wrestling's Wrestle Kingdom 9" telecast was available from pay-per-view providers in the United States, including <a href="DirecTV">DirecTV</a>, <a href="Dish%20Network">Dish Network</a>, <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20U-verse">AT&T U-verse</a>, <a href="Comcast">Comcast</a>, <a href="Verizon%20FiOS">Verizon FiOS</a> and all cable systems, and in Canada from <a href="Bell%20ExpressVu">Bell ExpressVu</a>, <a href="Rogers%20Communications">Rogers</a>, <a href="Shaw%20Communications">Shaw</a>, <a href="Sasktel">Sasktel</a> and <a href="Telus">Telus</a>. The event also aired live on <a href="New%20Japan%20Pro%20Wrestling%20World">New Japan Pro Wrestling World</a>, an Internet streaming site introduced by NJPW in early December 2014 which reportedly had 20,000 subscribers worldwide in late January 2015. In Japan, the event also aired on PPV in <a href="SKY%20PerfecTV%21">SKY PerfecTV!</a>'s Sukachan service. In January 2016, <a href="Dave%20Meltzer">Dave Meltzer</a> of the "<a href="Wrestling%20Observer%20Newsletter">Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a>" stated that Wrestle Kingdom 9 "was the only live pro wrestling PPV event ever broadcast [internationally] from Japan".

The GFW version of the event was streamed worldwide (except in North America and Japan) on the <a href="Flipps">Flipps</a> application for Internet-connected smartphones, tablet computers and smart TVs. On Flipps, the show was available live and <a href="Video%20on%20demand">on-demand</a> for 30 days after its initial airing.

On November 11, 2014, GFW announced that <a href="Jim%20Ross">Jim Ross</a> would be the lead announcer for its version of the event. It was Ross's first professional-wrestling broadcast since his 2013 departure from WWE. Ross attempted to obtain <a href="Mike%20Tenay">Mike Tenay</a> of <a href="Total%20Nonstop%20Action%20Wrestling">Total Nonstop Action Wrestling</a> (TNA) for color commentary, but TNA refused. Others considered for the job were John Pollock, <a href="Mauro%20Ranallo">Mauro Ranallo</a> and <a href="Kevin%20Nash">Kevin Nash</a>, before GFW settled on <a href="Matt%20Striker">Matt Striker</a>.

Before the event, the GFW broadcasts experienced setbacks. Many cable companies decided not to air the event live, opting instead for a replay of <a href="UFC%20182">UFC 182</a>, and the stream would not run on three of the four most used devices compatible with Flipps: <a href="Chromecast">Chromecast</a>, <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> and <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a>. According to Dave Meltzer, NJPW undercut GFW by including the event in the $8.42 monthly price for New Japan Pro Wrestling World; the GFW broadcast of Wrestle Kingdom 9 alone was $34.95. The New Japan Pro Wrestling World stream had Japanese commentary only.

<a href="AXS%20TV">AXS TV</a>, which acquired the rights to broadcast Wrestle Kingdom 9 from the <a href="TV%20Asahi%20Corporation">TV Asahi Corporation</a>, aired the event in five parts from October 9 to November 6, 2015, to viewers in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. Commentary was provided by Mauro Ranallo and <a href="Josh%20Barnett">Josh Barnett</a>.

Wrestle Kingdom 9 featured ten <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types">professional wrestling matches</a> and one pre-show match. It saw professional wrestlers performing as <a href="Character%20%28arts%29">characters</a> in <a href="Kayfabe">scripted events</a> pre-determined by the hosting <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20promotion">promotion</a>, New Japan Pro Wrestling.
The event was headlined by <a href="Hiroshi%20Tanahashi">Hiroshi Tanahashi</a> defending the <a href="IWGP%20Heavyweight%20Championship">IWGP Heavyweight Championship</a> against <a href="Kazuchika%20Okada">Kazuchika Okada</a>. Tanahashi won the title by defeating <a href="A.J.%20Styles">A.J. Styles</a> on October 13, 2014, at the NJPW <a href="King%20of%20Pro-Wrestling%20%282014%29">King of Pro-Wrestling</a> event. Okada became the number one contender at Wrestle Kingdom 9 by winning the <a href="G1%20Climax">G1 Climax</a> on August 10, 2014. Over the following months, he defended his position against <a href="Karl%20Anderson">Karl Anderson</a> and <a href="Tetsuya%20Naito">Tetsuya Naito</a>. The Wrestle Kingdom 9 main event was the seventh match between Okada and Tanahashi since February 2012 and their second January 4 Tokyo Dome Show main event after <a href="Wrestle%20Kingdom%207">Wrestle Kingdom 7</a> on January 4, 2013.

Wrestle Kingdom 9's other main event was determined at the November 8, 2014, NJPW <a href="Power%20Struggle%20%282014%29">Power Struggle</a> show. After <a href="Shinsuke%20Nakamura">Shinsuke Nakamura</a> defended the <a href="IWGP%20Intercontinental%20Championship">IWGP Intercontinental Championship</a> against <a href="Katsuyori%20Shibata">Katsuyori Shibata</a>, <a href="Kota%20Ibushi">Kota Ibushi</a> entered the ring, assaulted Nakamura, and issued a title challenge; Nakamura accepted. This was a turning point in Ibushi's career, since he had recently joined the heavyweight division after gaining weight. A previous singles match between Nakamura and Ibushi during the <a href="2013%20G1%20Climax">2013 G1 Climax</a> was ranked "Best Bout of the Year" by the "<a href="Tokyo%20Sports">Tokyo Sports</a>" newspaper.

Previous IWGP Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles (of the <a href="Bullet%20Club">Bullet Club</a> group) and fellow top contender Tetsuya Naito were slated to wrestle each other at Wrestle Kingdom 9. During the 2014 G1 Climax (when Styles was IWGP Heavyweight Champion), Naito pinned him in a non-title tournament match but did not have a title shot before Styles lost to Tanahashi. Since Styles did not receive a rematch with Tanahashi, it was theorized by the American media that the Wrestle Kingdom 9 winner would be the top contender.

Another title that was contested at Wrestle Kingdom 9 was the <a href="IWGP%20Tag%20Team%20Championship">IWGP Tag Team Championship</a>, with <a href="Doc%20Gallows">Doc Gallows</a> and Karl Anderson defending against <a href="Hirooki%20Goto">Hirooki Goto</a> and Katsuyori Shibata. Goto and Shibata teamed up after a match against each other at the January 4, 2014, NJPW <a href="Wrestle%20Kingdom%208">Wrestle Kingdom 8</a>, and the two former high-school classmates named their team "<a href="Meiyu%20Tag">Meiyu Tag</a>" ("meiyu" means "sworn brothers" in Japanese). In March 2014, they entered the IWGP Tag Team Championship picture by defeating the Bullet Club's IWGP Tag Team Champions Anderson and Gallows in a non-title match at NJPW's 42nd-anniversary event. This led to a title match at the April 6 NJPW <a href="Invasion%20Attack%202014">Invasion Attack 2014</a>, where Anderson and Gallows retained the title. In December, Goto and Shibata won the <a href="2014%20World%20Tag%20League">2014 World Tag League</a> tournament, defeating Anderson and Gallows in the final to earn another chance at the title.

Wrestle Kingdom 9 also showcased a rivalry between <a href="Toru%20Yano">Toru Yano</a> and the <a href="Suzuki-gun">Suzuki-gun</a> <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20stable">group</a>, which had been going on since 2013. In May 2014, Yano's tag team partner <a href="Takashi%20Iizuka">Takashi Iizuka</a> joined Suzuki-gun, which led to Yano recruiting <a href="Kazushi%20Sakuraba">Kazushi Sakuraba</a> as his new tag team partner to continue the feud. The rivalry lasted for the rest of the year, resulting in two Wrestle Kingdom 9 matches: one between former <a href="Mixed%20martial%20arts">mixed martial artists</a> Sakuraba and Suzuki-gun leader <a href="Minoru%20Suzuki">Minoru Suzuki</a>, and a tag team match pitting Yano and a "mystery partner" against a Suzuki-gun team. The latter became an <a href="eight-man%20tag%20team%20match">eight-man tag team match</a>, with Suzuki-gun represented by Iizuka, <a href="Shelton%20X%20Benjamin">Shelton X Benjamin</a>, and the <a href="Killer%20Elite%20Squad">Killer Elite Squad</a> (<a href="Davey%20Boy%20Smith%20Jr.">Davey Boy Smith Jr.</a> and <a href="Lance%20Archer">Lance Archer</a>). Yano recruited three partners from the <a href="Pro%20Wrestling%20Noah">Pro Wrestling Noah</a> <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20promotion">promotion</a>: <a href="Naomichi%20Marufuji">Naomichi Marufuji</a> and <a href="The%20Mighty%20Don%27t%20Kneel">TMDK</a> (<a href="Mikey%20Nicholls">Mikey Nicholls</a> and <a href="Shane%20Haste">Shane Haste</a>).

The Wrestle Kingdom 9 <a href="undercard">undercard</a> featured several matches involving the Bullet Club, which was led by A.J. Styles. The group dominated NJPW for most of 2014, holding all four of its heavyweight championships during the summer. After the NJPW–GFW partnership was forged, GFW head Jeff Jarrett joined the Bullet Club on August 10. On December 7, during a Bullet Club post-match assault on <a href="Tomoaki%20Honma">Tomoaki Honma</a>, NJPW veteran tag team <a href="Tencozy">Tencozy</a> (<a href="Hiroyoshi%20Tenzan">Hiroyoshi Tenzan</a> and <a href="Satoshi%20Kojima">Satoshi Kojima</a>) stormed into the ring to the aid of Honma, driving the Bullet Club away. They then joined Honma to challenge the stable to a <a href="six-man%20tag%20team%20match">six-man tag team match</a> at Wrestle Kingdom 9. <a href="Bad%20Luck%20Fale">Bad Luck Fale</a>, <a href="Yujiro%20Takahashi">Yujiro Takahashi</a> and Jeff Jarrett—making his NJPW ring debut—were scheduled to represent the Bullet Club at the event.

The pre-show featured one match, the <a href="New%20Japan%20Rumble">New Japan Rumble</a>. <a href="Tiger%20Mask%20IV">Tiger Mask</a> and <a href="Yuji%20Nagata">Yuji Nagata</a> began the match, with new wrestlers entering each minute. Wrestlers worked to eliminate each other, and the last remaining wrestler won. In this match, eliminations could occur via <a href="Pin%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">pinfall</a>, <a href="Submission%20%28combat%20sports%29">submission</a>, <a href="Professional%20wrestling%23Disqualification">disqualification</a>, or being thrown out of the ring over the top rope. The <a href="Great%20Kabuki">Great Kabuki</a>, <a href="Yoshiaki%20Fujiwara">Yoshiaki Fujiwara</a>, and <a href="Hiro%20Saito">Hiro Saito</a> were surprise entrants. <a href="Captain%20New%20Japan">Captain New Japan</a> was the first eliminated when <a href="Tama%20Tonga">Tama Tonga</a> threw him over the top rope. <a href="Sho%20Tanaka">Sho Tanaka</a> and <a href="Yohei%20Komatsu">Yohei Komatsu</a> worked together to eliminate <a href="Taichi%20Ishikari">Taichi</a> and Tiger Mask. After Tanaka was eliminated by submitting to <a href="Manabu%20Nakanishi">Manabu Nakanishi</a>'s <a href="Argentine%20backbreaker%20rack">torture rack</a>, Tonga eliminated Nakanishi and Komatsu via pinfall, the latter after a <a href="DDT%20%28professional%20wrestling%29%23Jumping%20DDT">jumping DDT</a>. <a href="Yoshi-Hashi">Yoshi-Hashi</a> threw Tonga over the top rope for the elimination, leaving himself and Nagata in the match. Nagata won the match by slamming Hashi against the mat with a <a href="belly-to-back%20suplex">belly-to-back suplex</a>, bridging into a pinfall elimination at 26 minutes and 9 seconds.

The first match of the PPV show saw reDRagon (Kyle O'Reilly and Bobby Fish) defending the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against Forever Hooligans (Alex Koslov and Rocky Romero), Time Splitters (Alex Shelley and Kushida), and the Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson). Romero performed the "Forever Clothesline" (multiple <a href="corner%20clothesline">corner clothesline</a>s) and double clotheslines on his opponents. A series of <a href="Suicide%20Dive">dives out of the ring</a> culminated in Kushida diving from the turnbuckles onto his opponents on the floor. Although Time Splitters followed with a <a href="neckbreaker">neckbreaker</a>-<a href="moonsault">moonsault</a> combination on Nick, the three-count for a pinfall was stopped at two. The Young Bucks started a "Superkick Party" (multiple <a href="superkick">superkick</a>s) and continued with a "Meltzer Driver" (<a href="Professional%20wrestling%20double-team%20maneuvers%23Aided%20piledriver">assisted</a> <a href="Tombstone%20piledriver">Tombstone piledriver</a>) on Koslov, but the pin was again broken up. ReDRagon took over with a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20double-team%20maneuvers%23Backbreaker%20hold%2C%20diving%20attack%20combination">backbreaker and</a> <a href="diving%20knee%20drop">diving knee drop</a> on Shelley, a <a href="double%20arm%20DDT">double arm DDT</a> and <a href="wheelbarrow%20suplex">wheelbarrow suplex</a> on Matt, and a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20aerial%20techniques%23Super">super</a> <a href="falcon%20arrow">falcon arrow</a> by Fish on Nick. The first "Chasing the Dragon" <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Kick">kick</a>/<a href="brainbuster">brainbuster</a> combination attempt was countered by an <a href="Pin%20%28professional%20wrestling%29%23Small%20package">inside cradle</a> by Koslov for a two count, but the second "Chasing the Dragon" attempt succeeded; O'Reilly pinned Koslov to retain the title at 13 minutes and 1 second.

In the second match, the Bullet Club's Bad Luck Fale, Jeff Jarrett, and Yujiro Takahashi faced New Japan's Hiroyoshi Tenzan, Satoshi Kojima, and Tomoaki Honma. Takahashi received a Jarrett <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Guitar%20shot">guitar shot</a> meant for Honma, a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20double-team%20maneuvers%23Death%20Drop">3D</a> from Tencozy, and a "Kokeshi" <a href="diving%20headbutt">diving headbutt</a> from Honma before Honma pinned him for the victory at 5 minutes and 35 seconds.

The third match saw Suzuki-gun's Davey Boy Smith Jr., Lance Archer, Shelton Benjamin, and Takashi Iizuka opposing Toru Yano and Pro Wrestling Noah representatives Naomichi Marufuji, Mikey Nicholls, and Shane Haste. Smith's <a href="powerbomb">powerbomb</a> of Nicholls, Archer's <a href="chokeslam">chokeslam</a> of Haste, and Benjamin's <a href="Suplex%23Super%20belly-to-belly%20suplex">super overhead belly-to-belly throw</a> of Marufuji were not enough for the victory; the opposing team overwhelmed Iizuka with a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Low%20blow">low blow</a> by Yano, a double-team <a href="gorilla%20press%20slam">gorilla press slam</a> by TMDK, and a "Tiger Uppercut" <a href="knee%20lift">knee lift</a> by Marufuji. This led to Marufuji scoring a pinfall on Iizuka at 5 minutes and 5 seconds.

The fourth match, between Minoru Suzuki and Kazushi Sakuraba, was conducted under <a href="UWFi">UWFi</a> rules; it would end with a knockout, submission, or referee stoppage. During the match, Sakuraba and Suzuki battled onto the entrance ramp, where Sakuraba used a <a href="kimura%20lock">kimura lock</a> to injure Suzuki's arm. When they returned to the ring, Sakuraba targeted Suzuki's injured arm with kicks, <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Stomp">stomps</a>, and a <a href="cross%20armbreaker">cross armbreaker</a> hold. Suzuki withstood the assault, responding with <a href="Slap%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">slaps</a> with his good arm and a running kick to Sakuraba's face. Suzuki applied a <a href="rear%20naked%20choke">rear naked choke</a>, making a judo throw while maintaining the choke ("Saka Otoshi"). Sakuraba fought the hold until he lost consciousness, at which point the referee stopped the match in favour of Suzuki at 9 minutes and 21 seconds. After the match, the wrestlers shook hands and embraced.

Next, <a href="Tomohiro%20Ishii">Tomohiro Ishii</a> defended the <a href="NEVER%20Openweight%20Championship">NEVER Openweight Championship</a> against <a href="Togi%20Makabe">Togi Makabe</a>. <a href="Clothesline%20from%20texas">Clotheslines</a>, <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Forearm%20smash">forearms</a>, <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Shoulder%20block">shoulder blocks</a>, slaps, <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Headbutt">headbutts</a>, <a href="Double%20axe%20hammer">sledgehammers</a>, <a href="powerslam">powerslam</a>s, powerbombs, and <a href="German%20suplex">German suplex</a>es were exchanged. Makabe won the match (and the title) with a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Lariat">running lariat</a> and the "King Kong Knee Drop" from the top rope, followed by a pinfall at 12 minutes and 23 seconds.

In the sixth match, <a href="Ryusuke%20Taguchi">Ryusuke Taguchi</a> defended the <a href="IWGP%20Junior%20Heavyweight%20Championship">IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship</a> against <a href="Kenny%20Omega">Kenny Omega</a> of the Bullet Club. Distractions by the Bullet Club's Young Bucks allowed Omega to spray Taguchi in the eyes with an <a href="aerosol%20can">aerosol can</a> and broke Taguchi's <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20holds%23Ankle%20lock">ankle lock</a> on Omega later in the match. Omega captured the championship after a <a href="Snap%20suplex">snap</a> <a href="dragon%20suplex">dragon suplex</a>, a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Bicycle%20kick">bicycle</a> <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Knee%20strikes">knee strike</a>, and the "One Winged Angel" (<a href="Professional%20wrestling%20throws%23Electric%20chair%20driver">electric chair dropped into a one-handed driver</a>), pinning the champion at 13 minutes and 20 seconds.

The final tag team match of the event, the IWGP Tag Team Championship, pitted the Bullet Club's Karl Anderson and Doc Gallows against challengers Meiyu Tag (Hirooki Goto and Katsuyori Shibata). The champions controlled Goto early in the match, but after Goto tagged in Shibata, all four men battled in the ring. At the end of the match, Anderson was kicked off the ring apron by Shibata; this led to a pinfall on Gallows after a double-team <a href="GTS%20%28wrestling%29">GTS</a> and Shibata's "<a href="Soccer%20kick%23In%20professional%20wrestling">Penalty Kick</a>", giving Meiyu Tag the title after 9 minutes.

The eighth match was between A.J. Styles and Tetsuya Naito. Although Styles twice attempted his signature "<a href="A.J.%20Styles%23In%20wrestling">Styles Clash</a>", Naito countered and Styles then focused on attacking Naito's left leg. Styles later applied the "<a href="Calf%20slicer">Calf Killer</a>", forcing Naito to grab the rope to break the hold. After another "Styles Clash" attempt, Naito countered by throwing Styles over the top rope to the floor. When Styles returned to the ring after a 19 count (NJPW employs a 20 count in their matches), Naito attempted a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20aerial%20techniques%23Super">top-rope</a> <a href="huracanrana">huracanrana</a>. Styles blocked it, converting it to a "Styles Clash" from the second rope before pinning Naito for another Bullet Club victory at 14 minutes and 25 seconds.

Wrestle Kingdom 9 featured two main event matches. In the first, Shinsuke Nakamura defended the IWGP Intercontinental Championship against Kota Ibushi. Ibushi ridiculed Nakamura and used several of the champion's moves, including the <a href="Corner%20foot%20choke">corner vibration boot</a>, the reverse powerslam, and the "Boma Ye" knee strike. Nakamura, responding aggressively, kicked out of the latter at one. Nakamura used a variety of knee-based strikes, and Ibushi's attacks included a <a href="Standing%20moonsault">standing</a> <a href="corkscrew%20moonsault">corkscrew moonsault</a>, a <a href="roundhouse%20kick">roundhouse kick</a>, an <a href="Elevated%20powerbomb">elevated</a> <a href="sit-out%20powerbomb">sit-out powerbomb</a>, and a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Double%20foot%20stomp">double stomp</a> to the chest. Ibushi also jumped on the top rope, grabbing Nakamura on the apron, and German-suplexed him back into the ring for a two count. In the finishing sequence, Ibushi got up immediately after receiving a knee from the second rope to the back of his head; both attempted the "Boma Ye", but Nakamura recovered first with the "<a href="Powerslam%23Samoan%20driver">Landslide</a>" and then the "Boma Ye" knee to retain the title at 20 minutes and 12 seconds. After the match, the wrestlers <a href="fist%20bump">bumped fists</a>.

In the second main event, Hiroshi Tanahashi defended the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Kazuchika Okada. The challenger controlled the early match with a <a href="hanging%20DDT">hanging DDT</a> onto the floor, a "Heavy Rain" (<a href="Death%20Valley%20driver">Death Valley driver</a>) on the entrance ramp, and the "D.I.D." submission. After they battled on the top rope, Tanahashi missed a "High Fly Flow" but countered Okada's "<a href="Kazuchika%20Okada%23In%20wrestling">Rainmaker</a>". The momentum shifted to Tanahashi as he performed a <a href="dragon%20screw%20legwhip">dragon screw legwhip</a> and continued attacking Okada's leg. Tanahashi later dove off the top rope and over the guard rail with a "High Fly Flow" <a href="crossbody">crossbody</a> to Okada on the floor outside of the ring. After Tanahashi tried another "High Fly Flow" crossbody back in the ring, Okada rolled through for a Tombstone piledriver, which Tanahashi countered with his own Tombstone. Although Tanahashi landed a "High Fly Flow" to Okada's back and a traditional "High Fly Flow" <a href="frog%20splash">frog splash</a>, Okada kicked out at two for a nearfall.

Tanahashi next tried a "Rainmaker", which Okada countered with one of his own and scored a nearfall. Although Okada attempted the "Rainmaker" three more times, Tanahashi countered with a bridging <a href="Suplex%23X-Plex">straitjacket German suplex</a>, a bridging dragon suplex, a series of dragon-screw legwhips, and three "High Fly Flows". The first was a crossbody while Okada was on the ropes; the second a frog splash to a seated Okada, and the third another frog splash, after which Tanahashi scored a pinfall on Okada to retain the title at 30 minutes and 57 seconds. Okada wept as he left the ring, and Tanahashi shouted that his opponent had a long way to go before becoming the New Japan ace. Tanahashi closed the show, thanking the fans and performing his <a href="air%20guitar">air guitar</a> routine.

Wrestle Kingdom 9 drew 36,000 fans to the <a href="Tokyo%20Dome">Tokyo Dome</a>, reportedly (accordingly to "Wrestleview.com" and the "Wrestling Observer Newsletter") the best attendance for a NJPW January 4 Tokyo Dome Show in 13 years. The event reportedly had 12,000 to 15,000 purchases in North America.

"<a href="Kobe%20Shimbun">Kobe Shimbun</a>" "Daily Sports Online" called Tanahashi "Mr. Tokyo Dome" for winning his fifth consecutive Wrestle Kingdom main event in the arena. Jason Namako of "Wrestleview.com", who watched the Japanese version of the show via New Japan World, said that the event "proved one thing, "puroresu" is, beyond a shadow of doubt, indeed "ichiban"!!" Meanwhile, Aaron Oster of "<a href="The%20Baltimore%20Sun">The Baltimore Sun</a>" wrote that "Wrestle Kingdom 9 has to be considered a success".

Bob Kapur of "<a href="Canoe.ca">Slam! Wrestling</a>" wrote that the show was "too good to miss", "even if you're not a Japanese wrestling fan", with the positives being in-ring action, commentary and production levels, and "perhaps the only negative comment were some technical issues" with his Rogers' <a href="High-definition%20video">HD</a> PPV feed failing. James Caldwell of the "Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter" also concurred that the show was a "must-see". As well as a "fantastic opening video package running down the card", the NEVER Openweight Championship match received four out of five stars as a "fantastic match taking the Tokyo Dome to the next level." The IWGP Intercontinental Championship match received four-and-a-half stars: "... a big-time match on a big-time stage, and Ibushi looked the part of a big-time player". The IWGP Heavyweight Championship match received five stars, with Caldwell stating, "There's nothing better in the industry than these two on a big stage in a big-time main event. Just the world's best."

According to Garrett Martin of the magazine <a href="Paste%20%28magazine%29">"Paste"</a>, Wrestle Kingdom 9 "easily could wind up being the best [wrestling show of the year] when the year is done". He praised Jim Ross, whose "timeless voice cut through the language barrier" for American wrestling fans, and likened his commentary to "reading the first English translation of <a href="Homer">Homer</a>." Martin commented on the ending of the show, stating that a "broken Kazuchika Okada shambling tearfully back towards the locker room ... made the moment feel real" which displayed that "Okada isn't just a great athlete but a better actor than most who step into the ring, and elevating the entire scripted, choreographed display into something beyond a sport." Martin wrote that New Japan had transcended <a href="puroresu">puroresu</a> and has produced "some of the most passionate and poignant performance art today."

Jason Powell of "Pro Wrestling Dot Net" predicted that even first-time viewers of New Japan would be "thrilled" watching this event. Although the "first half of the night felt rushed and had too many tag matches", the show still held his "interest from start to finish" and its final three matches were "amazing". Powell described several matches as overtaking each other as the night's best as the event progressed: the "very physical" Ishii–Makabe, then Naito–Styles, then Ibushi–Nakamura. English-language commentators Ross and Striker were endorsed as an overall positive. Lastly, Powell thought the "pay-per-view broadcast is fantastic", but he also said some "Pro Wrestling Dot Net" readers "reported issues with the Flipps app [broadcast] feed for the show.

In his review, Vaughn Johnson of the <a href="Philadelphia%20Media%20Network">Philadelphia Media Network</a> through "Philly.com" wrote: "Everything that was presented to the worldwide audience was simple and didn't require anyone to know the Japanese language. Good, quality wrestling is a universal language, and I got the message New Japan sent Sunday loud and clear." According to Johnson, some viewers were "exposed to a product for the first time where the outcomes of the matches are still important, as Okada showed by openly crying after his loss to Tanahashi" in a main event, which was "just as much a spectacle as it was a fantastic match athletic exhibition." He wrote that to call the Nakamura–Ibushi match "physical would be a gross understatement ... It was brutal to watch at times" but "one of the best" he had ever seen. Johnson praised the event as "devoid of popcorn matches and silly gimmicks that insult your intelligence", and commentators Ross and Striker for focusing "on the action in the ring and the significance of it instead of cracking jokes and making a million plugs."

According to the "Wrestling Observer Newsletter", although several early matches were "rushed", the final two were candidates for "match of the year". Readers of the publication voted Wrestle Kingdom 9 the <a href="List%20of%20Wrestling%20Observer%20Newsletter%20awards%23Best%20Major%20Show">Best Major Wrestling Show</a> of 2015; they also named the match between Ibushi and Nakamura the 2015 <a href="List%20of%20Wrestling%20Observer%20Newsletter%20awards%23Match%20of%20the%20Year">Pro Wrestling Match of the Year</a>, and the match between Okada and Tanahashi was voted the fourth best of 2015. Dave Meltzer gave commentary for the result in January 2016, describing Wrestle Kingdom 9 as "the blow away show of" 2015 and "the peak show of the rise of New Japan Pro Wrestling from very low levels for much of the late <a href="2000s%20%28decade%29">00s</a>".

According to commentator Jim Ross, Japanese television producer <a href="TV%20Asahi">TV Asahi</a> did not contact the English-language team during the event; he and Striker announced "by our instincts and it seemed to work out pretty well". Ross also said, "Time will tell but if this was my last pro wrestling event, I picked a damn good one on which to go out on."

In the wake of his loss to Hiroshi Tanahashi in the main event, Kazuchika Okada entered a "downward spiral" storyline with three quick losses to Bad Luck Fale. The day after his win over Tetsuya Naito, A.J. Styles emerged as the next challenger for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship by pinning Tanahashi in an eight-man tag team match. Styles then defeated Tanahashi for the championship on February 11 at NJPW <a href="The%20New%20Beginning%20in%20Osaka%20%282015%29">The New Beginning in Osaka</a>. Bullet Club captured two more titles in that event, with the Young Bucks winning the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, and Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson defeating Hirooki Goto and Katsuyori Shibata in a rematch from Wrestle Kingdom 9 to regain the IWGP Tag Team Championship. Okada's slump ended on April 5 at NJPW <a href="Invasion%20Attack%202015">Invasion Attack 2015</a>, where he defeated Fale, which he followed with a victory over Styles on July 5 at NJPW <a href="Dominion%207.5%20in%20Osaka-jo%20Hall">Dominion 7.5 in Osaka-jo Hall</a> to win the IWGP Heavyweight Championship.

Another rematch from Wrestle Kingdom 9 was scheduled for February 14 at NJPW <a href="The%20New%20Beginning%20in%20Sendai">The New Beginning in Sendai</a> between Togi Makabe and Tomohiro Ishii for the NEVER Openweight Championship. When Makabe was sidelined with <a href="influenza">influenza</a>, NJPW stripped him of the title and scheduled another match, in which Ishii defeated Tomoaki Honma for the now-<a href="Glossary%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23Vacant">vacant</a> title. Ishii and Makabe had their title rematch on April 29, when Makabe regained the NEVER Openweight Championship.

Wrestle Kingdom 9 broke Yuji Nagata's streak of consecutive January 4 Tokyo Dome Show appearances at 21 by being featured on the pre-show instead of the main card. In an interview, Nagata said that he felt slighted and thought about quitting when he was relegated to the pre-show. The day after the event, he was scheduled to challenge Shinsuke Nakamura for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship, returning to the IWGP main-event picture for the first time in years. Although Nagata received his title shot at NJPW The New Beginning in Sendai, he was defeated by Nakamura. Nakamura's Wrestle Kingdom 9 opponent, Kota Ibushi, won the <a href="New%20Japan%20Cup%232015">2015 New Japan Cup</a> tournament on March 15 by defeating Hirooki Goto in the finals, thus earning the right to choose a championship to challenge. Ibushi picked a match with A.J. Styles for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship (leaving Goto to challenge Nakamura). Ibushi failed in his title challenge on April 5 at NJPW Invasion Attack 2015, and Goto defeated Nakamura on May 3 at NJPW <a href="Wrestling%20Dontaku%202015">Wrestling Dontaku 2015</a> to become IWGP Intercontinental Champion.

After Wrestle Kingdom 9, Suzuki-gun declared war on Pro Wrestling Noah because Naomichi Marufuji and TMDK helped Toru Yano. This storyline <a href="Angle%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">angle</a> appeared at the January 10 Noah event, when Suzuki-gun attacked Marufuji and TMDK at the end of the show. After the event, the eight Suzuki-gun members began working for Noah, and by March 15, the group established its dominance by winning all four of Noah's championships: Suzuki became the <a href="GHC%20Heavyweight%20Champion">GHC Heavyweight Champion</a>, Killer Elite Squad the <a href="GHC%20Tag%20Team%20Champions">GHC Tag Team Champions</a>, Taichi the <a href="GHC%20Junior%20Heavyweight%20Champion">GHC Junior Heavyweight Champion</a>, and <a href="Ky%C5%8Dsuke%20Mikami">El Desperado</a> and <a href="Taka%20Michinoku">Taka Michinoku</a> the <a href="GHC%20Junior%20Heavyweight%20Tag%20Team%20Champions">GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions</a>.

A year later, at <a href="Wrestle%20Kingdom%2010">Wrestle Kingdom 10</a>, Okada defeated Tanahashi to retain the IWGP Heavyweight title; Nakamura beat Styles to retain the IWGP Intercontinental title; Honma and Makabe defeated Anderson and Gallows to capture the IWGP Tag Team title; Kushida beat Kenny Omega to capture the IWGP Junior Heavyweight title; the Young Bucks won a four-way match for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team title; Goto defeated Naito in a non-title match; Shibata defeated Ishii to capture the NEVER Openweight title; while Toru Yano and <a href="the%20Briscoes">the Briscoes</a> triumphed over Bad Luck Fale, Tama Tonga, and Yujiro Takahashi to become the inaugural <a href="NEVER%20Openweight%206-Man%20Tag%20Team%20Champions">NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Champions</a>.

Cleveland Centennial half dollar

The Cleveland Centennial half dollar is <a href="early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">a commemorative</a> <a href="half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">United States half dollar</a> struck at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> in 1936 and 1937, though all bear the earlier date. Sometimes known as the Cleveland Centennial Great Lakes Exposition half dollar, it was issued to mark the 100th anniversary of <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland, Ohio</a>, as an incorporated city, and in commemoration of the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Exposition">Great Lakes Exposition</a>, held in Cleveland in 1936.

In the mid-1930s, commemorative coins were increasing in value, and Cincinnati businessman <a href="Thomas%20G.%20Melish">Thomas G. Melish</a>, a coin collector, lobbied Congress to authorize several new issues, of which he would be the sole distributor. He was successful with the <a href="Cincinnati%20Musical%20Center%20half%20dollar">Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar</a>, from which he profited greatly, and with the Cleveland piece. <a href="Brenda%20Putnam">Brenda Putnam</a> designed the Cleveland coin, which was approved by the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a> after suggestions by sculptor <a href="Lee%20Lawrie">Lee Lawrie</a>.

Melish distributed the Cleveland coins through the exposition, at local banks, and by mail order from his office in Cincinnati. Sales were good, and the full authorized mintage of 50,000 was struck. Congress had inserted safeguards in the legislation to curb excessive profits, and though some of the coins were minted in 1937, there was no change of date, meaning collectors would only have to purchase one piece to have a complete set. Thousands remained in dealer inventories for years, and the coins remain inexpensive by the standards of commemorative coins of the era.

After the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, the area known as the <a href="Western%20Reserve">Western Reserve</a>, now in eastern Ohio, was the subject of dispute among the states, several of which claimed it as part of their territory. Although political rights to the area were given up to the federal government, Connecticut kept land ownership, and used part of its holdings to resettle those whose homes had been destroyed by the British during the war. The remainder was sold to the <a href="Connecticut%20Land%20Company">Connecticut Land Company</a> in 1795. <a href="Moses%20Cleaveland">Moses Cleaveland</a> was a surveyor, a lawyer, and one of the company's directors. In 1796, by the shores of <a href="Lake%20Erie">Lake Erie</a>, he set out a townsite that came to bear his name. In 1830, a newspaper was founded, to be called the "Cleaveland Advertiser". The editor found the name one character too long to fit in the printing form, and dropped the first "a" in Cleaveland—a change that was adopted by the public. The town of <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a> became a city in 1836.
<a href="Thomas%20G.%20Melish">Thomas G. Melish</a> was a prominent Cincinnati businessman, who had inherited the Bromwell Wire Company. Melish was also a coin collector, who came up with an idea for a commemorative coin that he would control. At the time, commemoratives were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. The result was the 1936 <a href="Cincinnati%20Music%20Center%20half%20dollar">Cincinnati Music Center half dollar</a>, an issue controlled by Melish and issued to commemorate a fiftieth anniversary that did not exist. Melish sold only a few coins at the issue price, which was high, keeping back most for later sale once scarcity drove the price higher. By 1936, the market for U.S. commemorative coins had become, according to <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a>, "as hot as a volcano", and "Congress gave [Melish] permission to have his own commemorative coins minted and to charge the public whatever he liked for them!" Melish, who had friends in Congress, had in early 1936 also tried to get lawmakers to authorize other commemorative issues that he would control. The only one of these that came to fruition was the Cleveland Centennial half dollar.

A bill for a Cleveland Centennial half dollar was introduced into the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> by Ohio's <a href="Robert%20J.%20Bulkley">Robert J. Bulkley</a> on March 23, 1936, and it was referred to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Banking%2C%20Housing%2C%20and%20Urban%20Affairs">Committee on Banking and Currency</a>. The bill was to honor both the 100th anniversary of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, and the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Exposition">Great Lakes Exposition</a>, to be held there in 1936. The original bill would have provided for 50,000 pieces, which could be purchased from the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> at any time, and could be struck by any or all of the three mints then in operation. The bill was reported back to the House by committee chairman <a href="Alva%20B.%20Adams">Alva B. Adams</a> of Colorado on March 26, drastically amended.

Adams had held hearings on other commemorative coins on March 11, 1936, and had separately been told of the abuses as issuers sought to get collectors to buy their coins. These included getting additional designs authorized (as in the case of the <a href="Arkansas%20Centennial%20half%20dollar">Arkansas Centennial half dollar</a>) and having the coins struck at all three mints. As the law required coins to bear the year of striking, and because <a href="mint%20mark">mint mark</a>s were used on coins produced at some mints, striking them in successive years at multiple mints created more <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23V">varieties</a> that coin enthusiasts would have to buy to keep their collections complete. The committee heard of the <a href="Oregon%20Trail%20Memorial%20half%20dollar">Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar</a>, authorized in 1926 and still being struck in 1936, and of commemorative coins created with intentionally low mintages as a way of inflating profits. When legislation for a Cleveland half dollar came before his committee, Adams struck the entire bill, after the <a href="list%20of%20enacting%20clauses">enacting clause</a>, and substituted a new version. The original legislation had given the Cleveland Centennial Commemorative Coin Committee, controlled by Melish, discretion to have the new piece struck at any of the mints, at any time even over the course of years, in any amount up to the authorized limit of 50,000. Adams's new text kept the total limit, but set a minimum of 25,000 that had to be issued. Adams's amendment required that all the coins be of a single design, be struck at a single mint (to be selected by the <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Director of the Mint</a>). It provided that all the coins be dated 1936 even if struck later, and that the Cleveland committee could purchase no less than 5,000 at a time. In a separate report, Senator Adams noted that Bulkley's original bill "contains certain provisions which the committee recommends be eliminated not only from such bill but also from all subsequent bills relating to the issuance of commemorative coins."

The bill, as amended, passed the Senate without recorded vote on March 27, 1936. The House of Representatives received the bill on April 1, and referred it to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. It was reported back to the House on April 16, having been amended to require the Cleveland committee to purchase not less than 25,000 coins at one time, eliminating the possibility that the committee could order an initial 5,000 and then fail to purchase any more. The full House considered the bill on April 23, 1936, with the bill reported by <a href="John%20Joseph%20Cochran">John Joseph Cochran</a> of Missouri as an emergency measure. When he asked for <a href="unanimous%20consent">unanimous consent</a> to pass the amended bill, Pennsylvania's <a href="Robert%20F.%20Rich">Robert F. Rich</a> asked how many coinage bills were going to be considered and if it would not be possible to consolidate a dozen of them into one bill. Cochran replied that he had consulted with Ohio's <a href="Robert%20Crosser">Robert Crosser</a> and been informed that "if we do not get the authority to print the coins now it will be useless". The following day, Bulkley moved that the Senate concur in the House amendments, which it did, and the bill was signed into law by President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> on May 5, 1936.

<a href="Brenda%20Putnam">Brenda Putnam</a>, a well-known sculptor, was engaged to design the coin. On May 1, even before Roosevelt signed the legislation, the Director of the Mint, <a href="Nellie%20Tayloe%20Ross">Nellie Tayloe Ross</a>, sent sketches that had been submitted by Putnam to the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>. That commission had been charged by President <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a>'s 1921 <a href="executive%20order">executive order</a> with rendering advisory opinions on the designs of public artworks, including coins. On May 2, commission chairman Charles Moore responded to Ross, giving preliminary approval, and stating that one of its members would work with Putnam as she prepared the necessary plaster models. That representative was <a href="Lee%20Lawrie">Lee Lawrie</a>, who suggested to Putnam that she use stars to represent the cities of the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> region. Putnam had placed, on the map on the reverse, sketches of buildings to represent the sites of Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, and Toronto. When Lawrie wrote to Moore to report this and other progress, Moore joked about the coin having an enlarged star for Cleveland,
Putnam's models were approved by the commission on June 2, 1936. The <a href="Medallic%20Art%20Company">Medallic Art Company</a> of New York reduced the models to half-dollar sized <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23H">hubs</a> from which coinage dies could be prepared.

Putnam's obverse features Moses Cleaveland, in a depiction based on the only known portrait of him, by an unknown artist. Surrounding Cleaveland are two lines of inscription, and . The designer's initials, "PB", are beneath Cleaveland's head. The reverse shows a map of the Great Lakes region with nine stars to represent its cities, listed from west to east: Duluth, Milwaukee, Chicago, Toledo, Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, Toledo and Rochester. Cleveland gets the largest star, which is transfixed by a compass. Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, in their book on commemoratives, stated that "we have not found documentation, but we suspect that the compass was intended to show Cleveland as the center of industry within a radius of approximately 900 miles", thus encompassing, the authors suggested, not only the Great Lakes cities represented, but New York, Boston, Washington, and St. Louis. The other inscriptions required by law appear in the upper right of the reverse, and surround the map.

Numismatist David Bullowa, in his early work on commemoratives, stated, "the design of this issue is pleasing ... the obverse and reverse alike are sharply defined, interesting and not crowded". Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, in his work on U.S. coins and medals, wrote that the half dollar "manages to combine most of the faults found in the better designs of the 1920s and 1930s." After complaining about the flat design and the large amount of lettering on both sides, Vermeule critiqued, "the bust of Moses Cleaveland can only be described as commonplace, and the view of the Great Lakes, bisected by a large compass, is nothing short of incomprehensible." Nevertheless, Vermeule suggested that Putnam did the best she could to squeeze the required text onto a half dollar, and might have done better with fewer words to place.

Melish, in his capacity as treasurer of the Cleveland committee, ordered 25,000 pieces in July 1936. They were shipped from the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>, where they were struck, on July 20. As well as those pieces, 15 coins were struck and set aside for inspection and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual <a href="Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>. Melish had arranged for the Philadelphia Mint to place the first 201 struck into individual numbered envelopes; these were later placed in special cardboard holders, the first by itself and each two thereafter together, with a notarized statement from Melish.

The Cleveland Centennial and Great Lakes Exposition opened on June 27, 1936, and before it closed on October 4, some four million people passed through its gates. Located on a 150-acre (61 ha) site by the shores of Lake Erie, there were artistic and industrial exhibits, as well as the usual amusements. The half dollars were sold at the fairgrounds, at Ohio banks, and by mail order from Melish's office in Cincinnati. Editor Lee Hewitt commented in the "Numismatic Scrapbook", "it seems strange that Mr. Melish, living in Cincinnati, should be the distributor of the Cleveland issue." The Cincinnati Musical Center coin had quickly sold out, the pieces Melish allowed on the market many times oversubscribed, but for the Cleveland piece, "Melish's sales strategy had to be very different; the coins would have to be aimed at the Exposition visitors and the general public at $1.50 each, not at his own coterie of greedy speculators".

Melish sent form letters to collectors warning that his committee had received offers from speculators to buy the entire issue and suggesting they act quickly to get their orders in. By the end of July, Melish wrote that 24,000 pieces had been distributed and that the remaining thousand soon would be. Sales were good enough that in February 1937, Melish ordered the 25,000 pieces which remained from the authorized quantity. In addition to those 25,000 coins, 15 more pieces were struck, intended for the 1938 Assay Commission. Because of the legislation, the new pieces resembled the old exactly, including bearing the date "1936". So many were produced that thousands were hoarded by coin dealers. In 1942, Melish offered 16,000 Cleveland Centennial half dollars to prominent dealer Abe Kosoff for any advance on face value. Kosoff, who would, after Melish's death, auction his coin collection, declined.

In 1941, the Western Reserve Coin Club of Cleveland celebrated its 20th anniversary by <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23C">countermarking</a> 100 Cleveland Centennial half dollars with a special design. The Secret Service objected, and many were destroyed. The club made similar markings for its 50th and 75th anniversaries, without government interference. The Cleveland Centennial coin is the most common commemorative of the many different designs struck in 1936. <a href="R.S.%20Yeoman">R.S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>", published in 2015, lists the issue at between $215 and $300, depending on condition. An exceptional specimen sold at auction in 2014 for $4,700.

California Diamond Jubilee half dollar

The California Diamond Jubilee half dollar was a <a href="United%20States%20commemorative%20coin">United States commemorative</a> <a href="silver%20coin">silver</a> <a href="half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">fifty-cent piece</a> struck at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a> in 1925. It was issued to celebrate the 75th anniversary of <a href="Compromise%20of%201850">California statehood</a>.

The San Francisco Citizens' Committee wished to issue a commemorative coin as a fundraiser for a celebration of the statehood <a href="diamond%20jubilee">diamond jubilee</a>. A California congressman attached authorization for it to another coinage bill, which was approved by <a href="68th%20United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> in early 1925. Designs by sculptor <a href="Jo%20Mora">Jo Mora</a> met a hostile reception at the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>, but the Citizens' Committee would not change them, and they were approved. The coin has been widely praised for its beauty in the years since.

The coins were struck in August 1925 in San Francisco, and were sold the following month. They did not sell as well as hoped: only some 150,000 of the authorized mintage of 300,000 were ever struck, and of that, nearly half went unsold and were melted. The coin is catalogued at between $200 and $1,300, though exceptional specimens have sold for more.

The land that is now the state of California was first visited by Europeans when Spanish explorer <a href="Juan%20Rodriguez%20Cabrillo">Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo</a> visited there in 1542. His report to the Spanish crown garnered little interest, and it was not until the English seaman Sir <a href="Francis%20Drake">Francis Drake</a> touched there in 1579 that the Spanish were moved to <a href="Spanish%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">colonize the area</a>. Nevertheless, over the next 275 years, California saw few settlers, mostly around the <a href="Spanish%20missions%20in%20California">chain of missions</a> that were founded there, both <a href="The%20Californias">under the Spanish</a>, and subsequently under <a href="Alta%20California">Mexican rule</a>.

According to <a href="numismatics">numismatic</a> author Arnie Slabaugh, "the coming of American settlers brought two changes to California that continue to this day: immigrants (both foreign and American) and activity". In 1846, American settlers revolted against Mexican rule, founding the <a href="Bear%20Flag%20Republic">Bear Flag Republic</a>; its flag featured a <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly bear</a>. The republic proved short-lived; the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a> had begun, and California was occupied by U.S. forces. A week before the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Guadalupe%20Hidalgo">Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</a> was signed in January 1848, gold was discovered at <a href="Sutter%27s%20Mill">Sutter's Mill</a> by <a href="James%20W.%20Marshall">James W. Marshall</a>. The <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a> followed, as did statehood for California in 1850.

The California Diamond Jubilee <a href="half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollar</a> originated with the desire of the San Francisco Citizens' Committee (<a href="Angelo%20J.%20Rossi">Angelo J. Rossi</a>, chairman), to have a commemorative half dollar to sell as a fundraiser for a local celebration in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of California statehood. On January 9, 1925, a bill was introduced in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a> for a silver half dollar and gold dollar commemorating the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bennington">Battle of Bennington</a> and the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>-period <a href="Vermont%20Republic">independence of Vermont</a>. The bill passed the Senate after an amendment removed the gold dollar. When the bill was debated in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> on February 16, 1925, California Congressman <a href="John%20E.%20Raker">John E. Raker</a> offered an amendment to add a coin for the 75th anniversary of California statehood. This was strongly opposed by Representative <a href="Albert%20Vestal">Albert Vestal</a>, chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Coinage%2C%20Weights%2C%20and%20Measures">House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures</a>, who stated that the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Bureau of the Mint</a> opposed making "these special coins". He added that because of this, Washington Representative <a href="Albert%20Johnson%20%28congressman%29">Albert Johnson</a> had agreed to withdraw his bill for a commemorative honoring <a href="Fort%20Vancouver">Fort Vancouver</a>, in Washington state. Raker nevertheless persisted, and his amendment passed. Representative Johnson then offered an amendment to add a <a href="Fort%20Vancouver%20Centennial%20half%20dollar">Fort Vancouver Centennial half dollar</a> to the bill, and to Vestal's chagrin, this also was adopted. The bill passed the House of Representatives, and the Senate agreed to the House amendments without debate on February 17.

<a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="Andrew%20W.%20Mellon">Andrew W. Mellon</a> urged President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> to <a href="veto">veto</a> the bill, writing:

Nevertheless, Coolidge signed the bill, which became the Act of February 24, 1925, authorizing all three coins. This was the first time commemorative coin legislation covered more than one issue. A total of 300,000 for the California piece was authorized, with the coins to be drawn at face value on behalf of the Citizens' Committee by the San Francisco Clearing House Association or the Los Angeles Clearing House Association. The latter group of banks had in 1923 distributed the <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine%20Centennial%20half%20dollar">Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar</a>.

On May 4, 1925, Rossi sent a letter to Mint Director <a href="Robert%20J.%20Grant">Robert J. Grant</a>. Rossi noted that there had been some delay in the preparation of the design for the new half dollar, and that California Senator <a href="Samuel%20M.%20Shortridge">Samuel M. Shortridge</a> had urged Rossi's committee to move forward without delay. Rossi enclosed sketches by California sculptor <a href="Jo%20Mora">Joseph (Jo) Mora</a>, with the promise that a finished design, and a model, would follow. Citizens' Committee members had selected Mora unanimously, feeling he was the one artist who could capture the spirit of what was being commemorated.
On receipt, the sketches and letter were forwarded to the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>, charged since 1921 with making recommendations on coinage design, and then to its sculptor member, <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a>, designer of the <a href="Buffalo%20nickel">Buffalo nickel</a>. Fraser wrote to Rossi on May 18, deprecating the designs, "the bear is entirely too short, and the whole thing inexperienced and amateurish." He recommended that <a href="Chester%20Beach">Chester Beach</a> (credited with the design of the 1923 <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine%20Centennial%20half%20dollar">Monroe Doctrine coin</a>) or <a href="Robert%20I.%20Aitken">Robert I. Aitken</a> (who had created the 1915 <a href="Panama%E2%80%93Pacific%20commemorative%20coins">Panama-Pacific $50 pieces</a>) be hired, as both were from California and might create "something which would be far more interesting and with a bigger sense of what California really is".

Despite Fraser's recommendations, the Citizens' Committee stayed with Mora, who quickly turned out the finished sketches. Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, in their volume on U.S. commemorative coins, suggested that the Citizens' Committee did not hire Beach or Aitken due to lack of time and an unwillingness to pay their large fees. The finished models were sent to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> on June 17, and were forwarded to the Commission. By this time, Fraser was no longer a member of the Commission and they were sent to <a href="Lorado%20Taft">Lorado Taft</a>, along with a note that the Citizens' Committee had not hired Aitken due to the expense and that the new designs were little better than the old. However, both Taft and another member, <a href="Louis%20Ayres">Louis Ayres</a>, recommended acceptance. Ayres did suggest "that '<a href="In%20God%20We%20Trust">In God We Trust</a>' be placed in some position where it does not seem as if the '49ers were frying it in oil". Numismatic historian <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a> averred that this advice was not followed due to the lack of an alternative position in which to place the motto.

With the designs accepted, the Mint created working dies based on the plaster model in July 1925. These were sent from Philadelphia to the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a>, where 150,000 coins were struck in August, plus 200 reserved for inspection and testing at the 1926 meeting of the <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">United States Assay Commission</a>.

In creating the half dollar, Mora used motifs evoking California at the time of statehood in 1850. The <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> depicts a Gold Rush-era prospector, kneeling. He washes material with <a href="gold%20panning">his pan</a>, seeking bits of <a href="placer%20gold">placer gold</a>. The reverse adapts the <a href="Flag%20of%20California">Flag of California</a>, known as the <a href="Bear%20Flag">Bear Flag</a>, showing a <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly bear</a>. Mora left the fields, or background, of the coin unpolished, giving the piece a textured look.

The California Diamond Jubilee half dollar has been widely admired. Swiatek deemed the coin "one of my favorite numismatic works of art". According to coin dealer and author <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a>, "the Citizens' Committee ... wisely ignored Fraser's criticism". Eric Brothers, in his 2014 article on the coin, wrote that it "embodied the quintessential imagery of California in the 1850s". David M. Bullowa, who studied commemorative coins on behalf of the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a> in the 1930s, regarded it as "a very virile and well executed half dollar, in which obverse and reverse are definitely related to each other". His contemporary, B. Max Mehl, wrote in 1937 that it was a "beautiful coin ... [the] obverse is a very fine piece of art". Nevertheless, he mistook the animal on the reverse for a polar bear, and expressed puzzlement: "I have traveled and toured California from one end to the other and have never yet seen a bear".

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, in his volume on American coinage, deemed the California piece "one of America's greatest works of numismatic coinage." He considered the design bold and effective, and especially admired the animal, stating that the "muscles, bones, and tufts of fur express the massive determination of the bear." He felt the lettering particularly successful, as two different sizes are used, and although all three phrases customary on American coinage are present ("Liberty", "In God We Trust", and "<a href="E%20pluribus%20unum">E Pluribus Unum</a>"), the "placing is so skillfully handled that it seems hard to realize all three ... inscriptions are used".

The first California Diamond Jubilee half dollar struck was given to the <a href="de%20Young%20%28museum%29">Memorial Museum</a> in <a href="Golden%20Gate%20Park">Golden Gate Park</a>, San Francisco. The die used for the initial strikings was specially treated to produce a frosted or <a href="Coin%20grading%23Complexity">cameo effect</a>, which wore down after the first approximately 75 strikings, according to Swiatek in his later volume on commemoratives. Numismatist Kevin Flynn suggests that the first 100 pieces exhibit these special surfaces, and that this was done at Rossi's request for presentation to VIPs. One piece is known without a <a href="mint%20mark">mint mark</a>; this was most likely a trial piece, prepared and owned by Mint Chief Engraver <a href="John%20R.%20Sinnock">John R. Sinnock</a> and later sold from his estate.

At least one half dollar must have left the San Francisco Mint by August 26, 1925, as it was shown at a meeting of the Pacific Coast Numismatic Society on that day. Children born on the 75th anniversary of California statehood (September 9, 1925) in that state were given one of the half dollars, a total of 494. A few pieces were mounted in badges used by officials. Many were sold at a celebration in San Francisco from September 6 to 12 in commemoration of that jubilee. Although thousands were purchased by coin collectors and dealers, the bulk are believed to have gone to non-collectors. According to Bowers, "distribution efforts were not particularly well coordinated" and 63,606 pieces were returned to the Mint for melting, leaving a total of 86,594 pieces distributed to the public, including the assay coins.

The half dollar has gradually risen in price over the years, with the only setbacks being the price declines following the commemorative coin booms of 1936 and 1980. The 2015 edition of <a href="Richard%20S.%20Yeoman">Richard S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" lists it at between $200 and $1,300, depending on condition. One, in exceptional <a href="Sheldon%20coin%20grading%20scale%23Numerical%20Grades%20for%20Uncirculated%20Coins">MS-68</a> condition, brought $17,250 at auction in 2009.

McKinley Birthplace Memorial dollar

The McKinley Birthplace Memorial dollar was a commemorative coin struck in gold by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> in 1916 and 1917, depicting the 25th <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>, <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a>. The coin's <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> was designed by Mint Chief Engraver <a href="Charles%20E.%20Barber">Charles E. Barber</a>, and the reverse by his assistant, <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">George T. Morgan</a>. As McKinley had appeared on a version of the 1903-dated <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase%20Exposition%20dollar">Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar</a>, the 1916 release made him the first person to appear on two issues of U.S. coins.

The coins were to be sold at a premium to finance the <a href="National%20McKinley%20Birthplace%20Memorial">National McKinley Birthplace Memorial</a> at <a href="Niles%2C%20Ohio">Niles, Ohio</a>, and were vended by the group constructing it. The issue was originally proposed as a silver dollar; this was changed when it was realized it would not be appropriate to honor a president who had supported the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a> with such a piece. The coins were poorly promoted, and did not sell well. Despite an authorized mintage of 100,000, only about 20,000 were sold, many of these at a reduced price to Texas coin dealer B. Max Mehl. Another 10,000 pieces were returned to the Mint for melting.

<a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> was born in <a href="Niles%2C%20Ohio">Niles, Ohio</a>, in 1843. He left college to work as a teacher, and enlisted in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> when the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> broke out in 1861. He served throughout the war, ending it as a <a href="Brevet%20%28military%29%23United%20States">brevet</a> major. Afterwards, he attended law school and was admitted to the bar. He settled in <a href="Canton%2C%20Ohio">Canton, Ohio</a>, and after practicing there, was elected to Congress in 1876. In 1890, he was defeated for re-election, but was elected governor the following year, serving two two-year terms.

With the aid of his close adviser <a href="Mark%20Hanna">Mark Hanna</a>, he secured the Republican nomination for president in 1896, amid a <a href="Panic%20of%201893">deep economic depression</a>. He defeated his Democratic rival, <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>, after a <a href="front%20porch%20campaign">front porch campaign</a> in which he advocated "sound money", that is, the gold standard unless modified by international agreement. This contrasted to "<a href="free%20silver">free silver</a>", pushed by Bryan in <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201896">his campaign</a>.

McKinley was president during the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> of 1898, in which the U.S. victory was quick and decisive. As part of <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281898%29">the peace settlement</a>, Spain turned over to the United States its overseas colonies of <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, <a href="Guam">Guam</a>, and the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>. With the nation prosperous, McKinley defeated Bryan again in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201900">1900 presidential election</a>. <a href="Assassination%20of%20William%20McKinley">President McKinley was assassinated</a> by <a href="Leon%20Czolgosz">Leon Czolgosz</a> in September 1901, and was succeeded by Vice President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>.

In the years after McKinley's death, several memorials were built to him, including a large structure housing his remains at Canton. Another memorial was built at his birthplace in Niles under the auspices of the National McKinley Birthplace Memorial Association (the Association). Designed by the firm of McKim, Mead, and White, the <a href="classical%20architecture">Greek Classic</a> memorial was built of Georgia marble and was dedicated in 1917. Housing a museum, library, and auditorium, as well as a statue of McKinley and busts of his associates, it remains open to the public, free of charge.

The McKinley Birthplace Memorial dollar was proposed as a fundraiser for the construction of the site in Niles. In February 1915, the Association's head, <a href="Joseph%20G.%20Butler%2C%20Jr.">Joseph G. Butler, Jr.</a>, met with Ohio Congressman <a href="William%20A.%20Ashbrook">William A. Ashbrook</a>, chairman of the <a href="House%20Committee%20on%20Coinage%2C%20Weights%2C%20and%20Measures">House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures</a>, to propose a silver dollar in honor of McKinley. Ashbrook was willing, and the two men saw Treasury Secretary <a href="William%20G.%20McAdoo">William G. McAdoo</a> and Acting <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Director of the Mint</a> Frederic Dewey, who envisioned no difficulty. Accordingly, Ashbrook introduced a bill in the final days of the <a href="63rd%20Congress">63rd Congress</a>, which took no action on it. When the <a href="64th%20Congress">64th Congress</a> opened in December 1915, Ashbrook reintroduced his bill, H.R. 2.

A hearing was held before Ashbrook's committee on January 13. Originally, the bill called for mintage of 100,000 silver dollars in commemoration of McKinley, but at the hearing, Butler requested that they be gold instead, stating, "if you will recall the fact, McKinley was elected in 1896 mainly on the question of the gold standard." The <a href="gold%20dollar">gold dollar</a> had not been struck as a circulating coin since 1889. Asked a question from New York Congressman <a href="James%20W.%20Husted%20%28Representative%29">James W. Husted</a> as to whether a gold dollar would be too small to be a souvenir, Butler responded, "No; I do not think so. I think, on the other hand, a silver dollar might be too large. I think we can dispose of gold dollars very much easier. Mr. Husted, and you know gold dollars are rather scarce just now." Ashbrook agreed, and stated:

Ohio Senator <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> was present at the House committee meeting and spoke in favor of the bill, arguing that "this assistance on the part of the Federal Government will cost nothing more than the making of the <a href="coining%20%28mint%29">dies</a> ". On being told that the dies, per the legislation, would be at the Association's expense, Harding replied, "I did not notice that. Then, it essentially costs the Government nothing whatever to render this mark of tribute and assistance." The committee reported the bill favorably on January 18, amending the bill to allow for the 100,000 gold dollars, to be purchased by the Association at par and sold at a profit to help build the memorial. The report indicated that the committee members "believe it is a deserved testimonial to the worth and service of a great man who lost his life while serving our Nation as its Chief Executive". The bill passed the House on February 7, 1916, and the Senate on February 15. It was enacted when President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> signed it on February 23, 1916.

The act provided that no more than 100,000 pieces be struck, with the necessary gold bullion to be acquired in the open market. The Association could purchase the coins at face value. The act required that the pieces be struck at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>, one of only two pieces of authorizing legislation in the classic commemorative coin series (through 1954) that specified the place of striking (the <a href="Panama%E2%80%93Pacific%20commemorative%20coins">Panama-Pacific issue</a> of 1915 had to be struck in <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco</a>). The act also required that the dies be destroyed after the coining was done, something numismatists Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a> questioned as duplicating provisions in the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Coinage Act of 1873</a>.

The designs were prepared in-house at the Philadelphia Mint by Chief Engraver <a href="Charles%20E.%20Barber">Charles E. Barber</a>, who designed the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> and his assistant, <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">George T. Morgan</a>, who prepared the reverse. They did not seek outside artists to submit proposals. Numismatic author <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> suggested that this was because Secretary McAdoo had sought non-employees to propose designs for the five Panama-Pacific coins along with those sketches prepared by Barber and his assistants, and the Mint's engravers had prepared only two of the five, and that because the artist assigned one, <a href="Evelyn%20Longman">Evelyn Longman</a>, had fallen ill. When the McKinley designs were submitted to the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a> on March 31, 1916, it recommended changes, though <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a>, who so stated, does not say what they were. In any event, no alteration was made, and the designs were approved.

The obverse of the dollar features an unadorned bust of McKinley, facing left, with the name of the country above and "McKinley Dollar" (in all capitals) below. McKinley, who had appeared on one version of the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase%20Exposition%20dollar">Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar</a> (issued beginning in 1903), thus became the first person to appear on two different issues of American coinage. The earlier pieces had also been designed by Barber, and the later coins, according to Bowers, "present an image so different that the uninformed observer would not know that the same man was being depicted". Bowers suggested that Barber might have been trying to create "a distinctively new version". Taxay agreed, opining that Barber's "chief concern seems to have been in making the portrait of McKinley as different as possible from that on the Louisiana Purchase coins".

The reverse, designed by Morgan, is intended to be a facing view of the McKinley birthplace memorial in Niles, but according to Swiatek and Breen, "the most charitable view must characterize it as inaccurate and incompetently done". Above the building is "McKinley Birthplace/Niles Ohio", and beneath it the date and "Memorial".

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, in his volume on U.S. coins, disliked the McKinley pieces. "When Barber and Morgan collaborated ... the results were almost always oppressive. The McKinley Memorial dollars of 1916 and 1917 bear witness to these stylistic judgments, the unclothed bust on the obverse looking tastelessly Roman and the classical, colonnaded Memorial Building placed across a reverse further constricted by too much, too large lettering."

The Philadelphia Mint struck 20,000 gold dollars in August and October 1916, plus 26 extra reserved for inspection and testing at the 1917 meeting of the <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">United States Assay Commission</a>. In February 1917, 10,000 more (plus 14 assay coins) were minted, again at Philadelphia. The Association sold these to the public at $3 each, the same price at which the Louisiana Purchase pieces, which sold poorly, had been vended. The McKinley Memorial pieces were ill-publicized, and few were sold at full price. Texas coin dealer B. Max Mehl purchased 10,000 pieces at an unknown price, selling them for years afterwards at $2.50 each.

"<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" reported on July 30, 1916 that the gold dollars had been released and were being "gobbled up as souvenirs". Nevertheless, according to Mehl in his 1937 volume on commemoratives, "the Committee in charge apparently realized that the number of collectors in the country could not and would not absorb an issue of 100,000 coins at $3.00 each" and some 10,000 coins "were disposed of at a greatly reduced price to the 'Texas Dealer' [that is, himself] who in turn distributed them extensively among collectors of the country at a reduced price". A total of 10,023 were returned by the Committee to the Mint for melting. It is uncertain how many of each year were melted, as the Mint did not keep records of this. Mehl estimated that the Committee sold 15,000 of the 1916 and 5,000 of the 1917 (including the sale to him), meaning that about 5,000 of each were melted. Bowers deemed these figures "probably correct", given Mehl's personal dealings with the Committee. Bowers calculated that 8,000 of the 1916 were sold by the Committee to collectors and the public, plus 7,000 to Mehl. He opined that 2,000 of the 1917 were sold by the Committee at full price, plus 3,000 to Mehl. Swiatek, in his 2012 book on commemoratives, estimated that between a third and half of the melted pieces were dated 1917.

According to <a href="R.%20S.%20Yeoman">R. S. Yeoman</a>'s 2015 edition of "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>", the 1916 is catalogued for $500 in slightly-worn <a href="Coin%20grading">AU-50</a> (almost uncirculated) to $1,850 in near-pristine MS-66. The 1917 is listed at $550 in AU-50 and $3,250 in MS-66. A 1916 in MS-68 condition was sold by <a href="Heritage%20Auctions">Heritage Auctions</a> in 2009 for $16,100.

Stanley Price Weir

<a href="Brigadier%20General">Brigadier General</a> Stanley Price Weir, (23 April 1866 – 14 November 1944) was a public servant and <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> officer. During World War I, he commanded the <a href="10th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">10th Battalion</a> of the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) during the <a href="landing%20at%20Anzac%20Cove">landing at Anzac Cove</a> and the subsequent <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a>, and during the Battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Pozi%C3%A8res">Pozières</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Mouquet%20Farm">Mouquet Farm</a> in France.

Weir returned to Australia at his own request in late 1916 at the age of 50, and in 1917 he was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> and was <a href="mentioned%20in%20dispatches">mentioned in dispatches</a> for his performance at Pozières and Mouquet Farm. He went on to become the first <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>n Public Service Commissioner. He was given an honorary promotion to <a href="brigadier%20general">brigadier general</a> on his retirement from the <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">Australian Military Forces</a> in 1921. Weir was retired as public service commissioner in 1931. In retirement he contributed to various benevolent and charitable organisations, and died in 1944.

Weir was born in <a href="Norwood%2C%20South%20Australia">Norwood, South Australia</a>, on 23 April 1866, a son of Alfred Weir and Susannah Mary (née Price). His father was a carpenter, who had emigrated to South Australia from <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, Scotland, in 1839, two years after the colony was founded. Weir attended Moore's School, the Norwood Public School, and <a href="Pulteney%20Grammar%20School">Pulteney Street Grammar School</a>. In 1879, at the age of 13, he joined the <a href="Surveyor%20General%20of%20South%20Australia">Surveyor General's Department</a> as an office assistant. He assisted the surveyor who pegged out the land at the rear of <a href="Government%20House%2C%20Adelaide">Government House, Adelaide</a>, for the <a href="Torrens%20Parade%20Ground">Torrens Parade Ground</a>, and was later promoted to clerk. On 14 May 1890, he married Rosa Wadham at the Christian Chapel, Norwood. He rose through the department to be appointed Survey Storekeeper, Custodian of Plans and Custodian of Government Motor Cars, on 1 July 1911. He was appointed a <a href="justice%20of%20the%20peace">justice of the peace</a> on 10 September 1914.

Weir enlisted in the part-time <a href="Colonial%20forces%20of%20Australia%23South%20Australia">South Australian Volunteer Military Force</a> in March 1885, joining the 1st Battalion, Adelaide Rifles, as a private. By 1890, he had been promoted to <a href="colour%20sergeant">colour sergeant</a>. He was commissioned as a <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in the 3rd Battalion, Adelaide Rifles, on 19 March 1890, and was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a> on 25 May 1893. When the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">South African War</a> broke out he volunteered for service with the <a href="South%20Australian%20Citizen%20Bushmen">South Australian Bushmen's Corps</a>, but mounted officers were preferred, and he was not selected.

On 1 July 1903, the Adelaide Rifles became the 10th Infantry Regiment of the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve%23Federation%20to%20World%20War%20I">Commonwealth Military Forces</a>, and Weir was appointed <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a>. He was promoted to <a href="major">major</a> on 1 January 1904, and appointed as regimental second-in-command. He was awarded the <a href="Long%20Service%20and%20Good%20Conduct%20Medal">Long Service and Good Conduct Medal</a> in 1905, and the <a href="Volunteer%20Officers%27%20Decoration">Volunteer Officers' Decoration</a> in 1908. On 22 June 1908, Weir was promoted to <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> and appointed the commanding officer of the 10th Infantry Regiment. On 1 January 1912, he was transferred to the unattached list but this only lasted until 1 July, when the <a href="Conscription%20in%20Australia">universal training scheme</a> was introduced. He was soon appointed to command the 19th Infantry Brigade, and on 9 September 1913 he was promoted to <a href="colonel">colonel</a>.

On 12 August 1914, Weir received a telegram from Colonel <a href="Ewen%20Sinclair-Maclagan">Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan</a>, the designated commander of the <a href="3rd%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">3rd Brigade</a>, offering him the command of the <a href="10th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">10th Battalion</a>. Weir promptly accepted, and on 17 August was appointed as a lieutenant colonel in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF), making him the first South Australian to be commissioned in the AIF. He retained his rank of colonel in the part-time forces in an honorary capacity.

Weir assembled and trained his battalion at the <a href="Morphettville%20Racecourse">Morphettville Racecourse</a>, then embarked with them on the transport "Ascanius" on 20 October 1914 as the first convoy of Australian troops departed for overseas service. On arrival in <a href="Fremantle">Fremantle</a>, six companies of the <a href="11th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">11th Battalion</a> were embarked on the transport, and Weir was appointed Officer Commanding Troops for the voyage. The troops began disembarking at <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> on 6 December 1914, and were entrained for <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, where they began to set up camp at Mena. The Australian Official War Historian, <a href="Charles%20Bean">Charles Bean</a>, described Weir as being "somewhat above average in years" for a battalion commander. Following the Allied decision to land a force on the Gallipoli Peninsula, the 3rd Brigade was selected as the covering force for the <a href="landing%20at%20Anzac%20Cove">landing at Anzac Cove</a>. The 10th Battalion embarked for the Greek island of <a href="Lemnos">Lemnos</a> in the northern <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> on 1 March 1915, and after further training on Lemnos, the battalion was one of the first two battalions ashore on the morning of 25 April 1915.

During the landing, when the boats carrying the lead elements of the battalion were around from shore, according to Bean, Weir observed to another officer in his boat that everything was silent, but soon after <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> troops began firing at the landing force. Weir landed with the scout platoon, and urged both his men and those of the <a href="9th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">9th Battalion</a> to immediately begin climbing the cliffs that overlooked the beach. Weir, along with "B" and "C" Companies of the battalion, reached what later became known as "Plugge's Plateau". Heavy fighting followed the initial landing and, within five days, half of Weir's battalion had been killed or wounded. The Australian and New Zealand advance inland from Anzac Cove was subsequently checked by the defending Ottoman forces and was eventually contained in a small beachhead inside a series of ridges that ranged around the cove. Weir was the only commanding officer from the 3rd Brigade to go forward of the first ridge, and a ridge running off the 400 Plateau subsequently became known as "Weir Ridge".

As stalemate set in, Weir continued to command his battalion throughout the early stages of the campaign until 25 August, when he was appointed acting <a href="brigadier%20general">brigadier general</a> and placed in command of the 3rd Brigade. On 11 September, he became ill and was evacuated to Malta, where he was admitted to hospital. He was subsequently evacuated to the United Kingdom, where he convalesced until January 1916, when he was appointed <a href="commandant">commandant</a> of the Australian reinforcement camp at <a href="Weymouth%2C%20Dorset">Weymouth, Dorset</a>.

Weir's health had not completely recovered by the time he embarked for Egypt, and he rejoined his battalion on 4 March 1916. After his departure, the 10th had fought through the remainder of the campaign before being withdrawn along with the rest of the Allied force in December 1915. The battalion was subsequently moved back to Egypt. In mid-1916, the bulk of the AIF was transferred to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, and Weir led the 10th Battalion through July and August 1916 during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pozi%C3%A8res">Battles of Pozières</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Mouquet%20Farm">Mouquet Farm</a>. At Pozières, the battalion suffered 350 casualties in four days. By the time of the battle, Weir was the only original battalion commander remaining in the <a href="1st%20Division%20%28Australia%29">1st Australian Division</a>, and had turned 50 years of age. On 23 August, immediately after Mouquet Farm, Weir was again appointed acting commander of the 3rd Brigade. Exhausted, on 7 September 1916 he asked to be relieved, and his request was granted. He returned to Australia on 23 September 1916, and his AIF appointment was terminated on 14 December. In the Australian official history of the war, Bean observed that despite his age, Weir "took his battalion into the front line, commanded it there throughout its first battle, and remained longer in the field than almost any of the senior militia officers who had left with the original force".

After his AIF appointment was terminated, Weir resumed his service in the Citizen Military Forces (CMF). In 1917, he was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> and the Russian Empire <a href="Order%20of%20St.%20Anna">Order of St. Anne, 2nd Class, with Swords</a>, and was <a href="mentioned%20in%20dispatches">mentioned in dispatches</a> for his performance at Pozières and Mouquet Farm. From 1917 to 1920, he was <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a> to the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General of Australia</a>, <a href="Ronald%20Munro%20Ferguson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Novar">Sir Ronald Craufurd Munro Ferguson</a>. Weir retired from the CMF as an honorary brigadier general in March 1921, his last appointment being as commander of the 20th Infantry Brigade. He was only the second South Australia-born officer to reach the rank of brigadier general. On 31 March 1921, Weir was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 10th Battalion, a position he held for many years.

Weir had two significant advantages in his return to a civilian career. Firstly, he was repatriated well before most servicemen and, secondly, South Australia had implemented a policy of preferment of returned servicemen for government employment. These circumstances helped him gain appointment as the first South Australian Public Service Commissioner in 1916. Weir was not suited to this role, being unable to navigate the competing personal and political agendas of senior public servants and politicians, and was soon sidelined. In 1925, legislative changes made it possible for the government to replace Weir, and this took place in 1930. In the last year-and-a-half before his retirement in 1931, Weir was the chairman of both the Central Board of Health and the Public Relief Board, excelling at the latter.

On 8 June 1923, after many years of poor health, Weir's wife Rosa died. He married Lydia Maria Schrapel in 1926. Weir led an active retirement, contributing to several religious, charitable and welfare organisations and activities. These included the <a href="Churches%20of%20Christ%20in%20Australia">Norwood and Maylands Churches of Christ</a>, <a href="Adelaide%20Benevolent%20Society">Benevolent and Stranger's Friend Society</a>, the <a href="Our%20Boys%20Institute">Our Boys Institute</a> (OBI), the <a href="Masonic%20Lodge">Masonic Lodge</a>, <a href="Cheer-Up%20Society">Cheer-Up Society</a>, and <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a>. At various times he served as President of the <a href="Commonwealth%20Club%20%28Australia%29">Commonwealth Club</a>, the Churches of Christ Union, the <a href="St.%20Peters%2C%20South%20Australia">St. Peters</a> Sub-Branch of the <a href="Returned%20and%20Services%20League%20of%20Australia">Returned and Services League</a>, and the Cheer Up Society.

Weir wrote the foreword for the history of the 10th Battalion, titled "The Fighting 10th: A South Australian Centenary Souvenir of the 10th Battalion, AIF 1914–1919", which was written by a former member of the battalion, Cecil Lock, and published in 1936. In 1943, Weir was badly injured in a car accident while returning from an OBI camp at <a href="Victor%20Harbor%2C%20South%20Australia">Victor Harbor</a>. It was believed that his injuries in the accident contributed to his death on 14 November 1944. Weir was survived by his wife Lydia, and his son Lionel and daughter Beryl from his first marriage. His brother, Harrison Weir, was the State Government Printer. Weir was buried in <a href="West%20Terrace%20Cemetery">West Terrace Cemetery</a>.

Weir received the following honours and awards:

Weir's military career commenced in March 1885, when he enlisted as a private. He quickly rose to the rank of colour sergeant before being commissioned in 1890. He rose from private to brigadier general over a career spanning 36 years. His officer promotion dates were:

Hurricane Marie (2014)

Hurricane Marie is tied as the <a href="List%20of%20the%20most%20intense%20tropical%20cyclones%23Eastern%20Pacific%20Ocean">seventh-most intense</a> <a href="Pacific%20hurricane">Pacific hurricane</a> on record, attaining a <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> of 918 <a href="Bar%20%28unit%29">mbar</a> (<a href="Pascal%20%28unit%29">hPa</a>; 27.11 <a href="Inches%20of%20Mercury">inHg</a>) in August 2014. On August 10, a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> emerged off the west coast of Africa over the Atlantic Ocean. Some organization of <a href="Atmospheric%20convection">shower and thunderstorm activity</a> initially took place, but dry air soon impinged upon the system and imparted weakening. The wave trekked westward across the Atlantic and <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean</a> for several days. On August 19, an <a href="Low-pressure%20area">area of low pressure</a> consolidated within the wave west of <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a>. With favorable atmospheric conditions, <a href="Atmospheric%20convection">convective activity</a> and <a href="rainband">banding features</a> increased around the system and by August 22, the system acquired enough organization to be classified as Tropical Depression Thirteen-E while situated about 370 mi (595 km) south-southeast of <a href="Acapulco">Acapulco</a>, Mexico. <a href="Tropical%20cyclogenesis">Development</a> was initially fast-paced, as the depression acquired tropical storm-force winds within six hours of formation and hurricane-force by August 23. However, due to some vertical <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> its intensification rate stalled, and for a time it remained a <a href="SSHS%23Category%201">Category 1 hurricane</a> on the <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20hurricane%20wind%20scale">Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale</a>.

On August 24, Marie developed an <a href="Eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> and <a href="Rapid%20deepening">rapidly intensified</a> to a <a href="List%20of%20Category%205%20Pacific%20hurricanes">Category 5 hurricane</a> with winds of 160 mph (260 km/h). At its peak, the hurricane's gale-force winds spanned an area 575 mi (925 km) across. Marie subsequently underwent an <a href="eyewall%20replacement%20cycle">eyewall replacement cycle</a> on August 25 which prompted steady weakening. Over the next several days, Marie progressively degraded to below hurricane strength as it moved into an increasingly hostile environment with cooler waters and a more stable atmosphere. On August 29, after having lost all signs of organized deep convection, Marie degenerated into a remnant low. The large system gradually wound down over the following several days, with winds subsiding below gale-force on August 30. The remnant cyclone eventually lost a well defined center and dissipated on September 2 about 1,200 mi (1,950 km) northeast of <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>.

Although Hurricane Marie's center remained well away from land throughout its entire existence, its large size brought increased surf to areas from Southwestern Mexico northward to southern <a href="California">California</a>. Off the coast of <a href="Los%20Cabos">Los Cabos</a>, three people drowned after their boat capsized in rough seas. In <a href="Colima">Colima</a> and <a href="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a>, heavy rains from <a href="Rainband">outer bands</a> caused flooding, resulting in two fatalities. Similar effects were felt across <a href="Baja%20California%20Sur">Baja California Sur</a>. Toward the end of August, Marie brought one of the largest hurricane-related surf events to southern California in decades. <a href="Swell%20%28ocean%29">Swells</a> of battered coastal areas, with structural damage occurring on <a href="Santa%20Catalina%20Island%2C%20California">Santa Catalina Island</a> and in the <a href="Greater%20Los%20Angeles%20Area">Greater Los Angeles Area</a>. A <a href="Breakwater%20%28structure%29">breakwater</a> near <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach</a> sustained $10 million worth of damage, with portions gouged out. One person drowned in the surf near <a href="Malibu%2C%20California">Malibu</a>. Hundreds of ocean rescues, including over 100 in Malibu alone, were attributed to the storm, and overall losses reached $20 million.

On August 10, the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> (NHC) began monitoring a westward moving <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> emerging off the west coast of Africa, centered along <a href="16th%20meridian%20west">16°W</a>. Accompanied by disorganized <a href="Atmospheric%20convection">convective activity</a>, <a href="tropical%20cyclogenesis">development</a>, if any, was expected to be slow. A broad <a href="low-pressure%20area">area of low pressure</a> subsequently formed within the wave about halfway between Africa and the <a href="Cape%20Verde%20Islands">Cape Verde Islands</a>. Embedded within an elongated <a href="Trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a>, the weak system struggled to organize and convection soon diminished. Interaction with a <a href="monsoon%20trough">monsoon trough</a> reinvigorated shower and thunderstorm activity on August 11 across a large area southwest of the Cape Verde Islands, but the surface low had dissipated by this time. Development was no longer expected over the following days as dry air created a hostile area for storm organization. The wave continued westward across the Atlantic and entered the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> on August 16. Subsequent interactions with South America and an <a href="cold-core%20low">upper-level trough</a> inhibited improvement of the system.

Beginning on August 17, the NHC anticipated that a low pressure area would form within five days to the south of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Tehuantepec">Gulf of Tehuantepec</a> in the East Pacific, with a 30% chance of <a href="tropical%20cyclogenesis">tropical cyclogenesis</a>. By the next day, the wave was located over Panama, and the NHC upgraded the potential for development to 60%. The wave crossed into the eastern Pacific with accompanying convection, developing a low pressure area on August 19. Conditions were favorable for further development, and the thunderstorms increased and became better organized on August 20. After an increase in <a href="rainband">rainband</a>s and <a href="outflow%20%28meteorology%29">outflow</a> around the well-defined center, the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Thirteen-E early on August 22 about 370 mi (595 km) south-southeast of <a href="Acapulco">Acapulco</a>, Mexico. A strong <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a> over the southern United States, later expanding into northern Mexico, steered the system on a west-northwest course throughout its existence as a tropical cyclone.
Conditions were favorable for the nascent depression to strengthen. The <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20forecast%20model%23Statistical%20guidance">Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme model</a> predicted the system would become a <a href="SSHS%23Category%204">Category 4</a> on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale when the system was only a tropical depression. Only six hours after the NHC issued its first advisory the agency upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Marie, the thirteenth <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20naming">named storm</a> of the <a href="2014%20Pacific%20hurricane%20season">2014 season</a>. The storm very quickly organized, developing a <a href="central%20dense%20overcast">central dense overcast</a> consisting of intense convection; this was aided by warm <a href="sea%20surface%20temperature">water temperatures</a> and low <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>. On August 23, the NHC upgraded Marie to hurricane status, and an <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> began forming later that day. On the next day, as the storm <a href="rapid%20deepening">rapidly intensified</a>, the eye became much more distinct and was surrounded by a powerful eyewall. During this phase the storm wobbled, shifting due west before resuming its previous motion. At 18:00 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> on August 24, Marie attained <a href="List%20of%20Category%205%20Pacific%20hurricanes">Category 5 status</a> on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, the first such Pacific hurricane since <a href="Hurricane%20Celia%20%282010%29">Celia in 2010</a>. The NHC estimated peak <a href="maximum%20sustained%20winds">sustained winds</a> of 160 mph (260 km/h), based on a <a href="Dvorak%20technique">Dvorak T-number</a> of 7.0 provided by <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center%23Tropical%20Analysis%20and%20Forecast%20Branch">TAFB</a> and <a href="Satellite%20Analysis%20Branch">SAB</a>. They also estimated Marie's minimum <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> at 918 <a href="Bar%20%28unit%29">mbar</a> (<a href="Pascal%20%28unit%29">hPa</a>; 27.11 <a href="Inches%20of%20Mercury">inHg</a>), ranking as the seventh-strongest in the Pacific east of the <a href="International%20Date%20Line">International Date Line</a> since records began in 1949. Coincidentally, <a href="Hurricane%20Odile">Hurricane Odile</a> attained the same pressure just three weeks later. At its peak, Marie was a large hurricane with tropical storm-force winds covering an area 575 mi (925 km) across.

Shortly after Marie attained peak intensity, the convection weakened due to an <a href="eyewall%20replacement%20cycle">eyewall replacement cycle</a>, in which an outer eye formed. The storm also weakened due to gradually decreasing water temperatures. By early on August 26, the eye became much less defined. The double eye feature persisted through that day, although the outer eyewall opened up as thunderstorms weakened further. Late on August 27, Marie weakened to tropical storm status, by which time the circulation became exposed from the convection. A strengthening ridge near <a href="California">California</a> caused the storm to accelerate more to the west-northwest, into an area of cooler waters and dry air. Failing to produce any additional convection, Marie degenerated into a remnant low late on August 28. The residual circulation gradually wound down as it continued northwest. Through August 29, the system continued to produce gale-force winds. Turning west and later west-southwest within a weak easterly flow, Marie slowly moved across the open Pacific while remaining a broad, weak cyclone. The former cyclone eventually lost a well-defined center and dissipated on September 2, about 1,200 mi (1,950 km) northeast of <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>.

Although the core of Hurricane Marie remained well offshore, a <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches%23Western%20Hemisphere">"green" alert</a> was issued for <a href="Guerrero">Guerrero</a> and <a href="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a> and a "blue" (minimal) alert was issued for <a href="Jalisco">Jalisco</a>, <a href="Colima">Colima</a>, <a href="Michoac%C3%A1n">Michoacán</a>, and <a href="Chiapas">Chiapas</a>. Heavy rains in Oaxaca triggered flooding and landslides, with the districts of Juquila and Pochutla being most affected. Five people were swept away by a swollen river; all were wounded but later rescued. A portion of <a href="Federal%20Highway%20200">Federal Highway 200</a> and a bridge were closed. Approximately 10,000 people were in need of assistance and a disaster declaration was requested for the state of Oaxaca. <a href="Storm%20surge">Storm surge</a> in Colima destroyed four buildings and damaged ten more. Flooding along the <a href="Marabasco%20River">Marabasco</a> and <a href="San%20Nicol%C3%A1s%20River">San Nicolás</a> rivers resulted in two fatalities. Minor flooding also occurred near Acapulco and in Colima where waves pounded the coast. In <a href="Guadalajara">Guadalajara</a>, numerous trees were downed and 12 shops were closed.

Off the coast of <a href="Los%20Cabos">Los Cabos</a> in <a href="Baja%20California%20Sur">Baja California Sur</a>, large <a href="Swell%20%28ocean%29">swells</a> capsized a fishing boat with seven people aboard on August 25. Four were able to swim back to shore while the other three remained missing and were later presumed dead. Strong <a href="Rainband">rain bands</a> along the outer fringes of Hurricane Marie brought heavy rain to parts of the state. Landslides blocked several roads near Los Cabos while gusty winds downed trees and power lines. Owing to the dangerous conditions, all schools Los Cabos were closed on August 25.

Owing to the size of Marie, increased surf was anticipated well north of the hurricane. <a href="Severe%20weather%20terminology%20%28United%20States%29%23Coastal/Lakeshore%20hazards">High surf advisories</a> were issued in California for the <a href="Greater%20Los%20Angeles%20Area">Greater Los Angeles Area</a>. Forecasters at the local <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">National Weather Service</a> office warned residents in <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County%2C%20California">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="Ventura%20County%2C%20California">Ventura</a> counties could "potentially see the largest surf in recent years generated by a hurricane." Swells of were anticipated with the risk of coastal flooding and structural damage. Advisories were also issued for <a href="Orange%20County%2C%20California">Orange</a> and <a href="Santa%20Barbara%20County%2C%20California">Santa Barbara</a> counties. Surf in the region ultimately reached along south-facing shores while west-facing beaches only saw waves up to .

The combination of large swells, high tide, and powerful south-to-north <a href="longshore%20current">longshore current</a>s impeded by the <a href="bight%20%28geography%29">bight</a> formed by the <a href="Palos%20Verdes%20Peninsula">Palos Verdes Peninsula</a> resulted in significant coastal flooding in <a href="Seal%20Beach%2C%20California">Seal Beach</a>. A four-block area of oceanfront property was affected; several apartments were left with inches of water on the ground floor. Severe <a href="beach%20erosion">beach erosion</a> resulted in the loss of 10,000–20,000 yd (7,600–15,200 m) of sand; a <a href="state%20of%20emergency">state of emergency</a> was declared to assist with restoration efforts. Near <a href="Malibu%2C%20California">Malibu Pier</a>, several surfers were caught in the rough swells and knocked into each other; one struck a rock, was knocked unconscious, and drowned. Malibu Pier itself sustained some damage and a lifeguard house built in the 1950s was destroyed. North of Malibu, one structure fell into the ocean. The <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County%20Fire%20Department">Los Angeles County Fire Department</a> assisted with over 115 ocean rescues on August 26. More than 170 rescues were made the following day, including 73 at the famous surfing spot "<a href="The%20Wedge%20%28surfing%29">The Wedge</a>" in <a href="Newport%20Beach%2C%20California">Newport Beach</a>.
Significant flooding also occurred in and around the <a href="Port%20of%20Long%20Beach">Port of Long Beach</a>. The <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">Army Corps of Engineers</a> was sent out to inspect significant damage to the middle <a href="Breakwater%20%28structure%29">breakwater</a> at Long Beach. Eleven sections of the breakwater sustained major damage, including three areas which were completely gouged out. Along the breakwater, of it sustained major damage, saw significant damage, and a further experienced moderate damage. Several hundred tons of rock were estimated to have been dislodged by the storm. The nearby San Pedro and Long Beach breakwaters saw substantial damage as well, though not as severe as the middle breakwater. Debris from the Navy Mole breakwater damaged a roadway near the "<a href="Sea%20Launch%20Commander">Sea Launch Commander</a>", within Long Beach. The breach resulted in roughly $3 million in damage to nearby terminals. Two <a href="barge">barge</a>s and a pleasure craft were loosed from their anchors by the surging waves and had to be towed back. Two terminals had to close due to dangerous conditions for workers. Less than two weeks after Marie, <a href="Hurricane%20Norbert%20%282014%29">Hurricane Norbert</a> threatened to bring further increased surf to the area. With the breakwater yet to be repaired, a large sand <a href="berm">berm</a> was reinforced along beaches and residents were supplied with sandbags.
The Army Corps estimated that it would take more than $20 million to repair just the major breaches along the middle breakwater. On September 18 Connolly-Pacific Co. was contracted for $5m to repair the twelve worst affected areas of the breakwaters and construction began on October 8. An estimated 20,000–30,000 tons of rock would be used in the project. A $200,000 repair budget was initially allocated for areas around Navy Mole, including Pier F, J South, and Navy Mole Road; this was later increased to $4 million by the Long Beach Board of Harbor Commissioners in January 2015.

On <a href="Santa%20Catalina%20Island%2C%20California">Santa Catalina Island</a>, boulders estimated to weigh were tossed inland by the surf. Substantial damage took place at the Avalon Harbor where many dry-docked boats were knocked off their stands. The harbor was littered with debris for several days, mainly pieces of lumber. A pier at White's Landing was also partially destroyed. A boat was tossed onshore at Pebbly Beach into Catalina Laundry, the only laundry business on the island. The building and a nearby boatyard were deemed total losses. Damage at the beach was deemed the worst since <a href="1997%20Pacific%20hurricane%20season">September 1997</a> when <a href="Hurricane%20Linda%20%281997%29">Hurricane Linda</a> brought large swells to the region. The Catalina Express ferry halted service on August 27 due to the rough seas. Damage across Catalina Island was estimated to be $3–5 million. Total losses in California amounted to nearly $20 million.

2017–18 Bergen County eruv controversy

In July 2017 the municipalities of <a href="Mahwah%2C%20New%20Jersey">Mahwah</a>, <a href="Upper%20Saddle%20River%2C%20New%20Jersey">Upper Saddle River</a> and <a href="Montvale%2C%20New%20Jersey">Montvale</a> in <a href="Bergen%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Bergen County, New Jersey</a>, in the United States, opposed extension of an <a href="eruv">eruv</a> within their borders. An eruv is a land area surrounded by a boundary of religious significance, often marked by small plastic pipes (called "lechis") attached to <a href="utility%20pole">utility pole</a>s. The demarcation permits <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">Orthodox</a> Jews to push or carry objects (such as prayer books, keys or baby strollers) within the eruv on the <a href="Shabbat">Jewish Sabbath</a>, in a way that is otherwise considered forbidden under Orthodox Jewish law.

The three municipalities ordered that the borders of the eruv be dismantled having been erected without the appropriate consents. Many Mahwah residents angrily protested against the prospect of Orthodox Jews from <a href="Rockland%20County%2C%20New%20York">Rockland County, New York</a>, using local parks or seeking to buy homes there.

After no agreement could be reached short of litigation, the eruv association brought suit against each of the municipalities. Mahwah's actions in passing a <a href="local%20ordinance">township ordinance</a> to bar nonresidents of New Jersey from its parks, and the hostility of some residents and council members towards those who supported the eruv led Democratic candidate for <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20Jersey">Governor of New Jersey</a> <a href="Phil%20Murphy">Phil Murphy</a> and others to make accusations of anti-Semitism. The presiding judge in the lawsuits, <a href="John%20Michael%20Vazquez">John Michael Vazquez</a>, in January 2018 made it clear he felt the municipalities did not have a strong case, and urged them to settle. The three municipalities have settled with the eruv association, allowing the eruv borders to remain. Mahwah has settled a lawsuit from the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Attorney%20General">New Jersey Attorney General</a> accusing it of discrimination.

The <a href="Township%20%28New%20Jersey%29">township</a> of <a href="Mahwah%2C%20New%20Jersey">Mahwah</a>, and the <a href="borough%20%28New%20Jersey%29">boroughs</a> of <a href="Upper%20Saddle%20River%2C%20New%20Jersey">Upper Saddle River</a> and <a href="Montvale%2C%20New%20Jersey">Montvale</a>, are neighboring municipalities in northwestern <a href="Bergen%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Bergen County, New Jersey</a>. All three are adjacent to the state line with New York, on the other side of which is <a href="Rockland%20County%2C%20New%20York">Rockland County</a>, where there are large communities of <a href="Orthodox%20Jew">Orthodox Jew</a>s.

An <a href="eruv">eruv</a> (plural "eruvin", or sometimes "eruvim") is an enclosure defined by string, rope, wires, cables, etc., that allows observant Jews, including the Orthodox, to carry or push objects further than is normally permitted on <a href="Shabbat">the Jewish Sabbath</a> (or Shabbat). Normally, on Shabbat, an object may not be taken from a private domain, such as a house, into a public one, such as a street or sidewalk, or moved, in a public area, more than 4 <a href="cubit">cubit</a>s (about 6 feet; 1.7 meters). "Domain" is a technical term referring to how enclosed an area is, not property ownership.

Objects may be moved freely if they remain within a private domain, and an eruv effectively extends the private domain through the area it encloses, including streets and sidewalks. The boundary of an eruv is often marked by utility poles surrounding a given area, with the space between regarded as doorways, topped by lintels, the telephone or power wires. The poles are regarded as doorposts, and are marked by lechis (singular: lechi), solid objects such as lengths of twine or of plastic pipe, which run from near the ground to just below the wires. In short, the act of stringing such a boundary around a public area by a Jewish community creates the pretense for its members that that public area is enclosed for the limited purpose of allowing the members to do some otherwise forbidden things in that public area on the Sabbath.

There are many requirements for eruvin; the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a> devotes <a href="Eruvin%20%28Talmud%29">an entire tractate</a> to the subject. This complexity makes <a href="Rabbi%23Functions">rabbinic supervision</a> and regular inspection mandatory. An operating eruv allows observant Jews to carry prayer books from home to synagogue on Shabbat, or to push strollers or baby carriages.
In <a href="Teaneck%2C%20New%20Jersey">Teaneck</a>, in southeastern Bergen County and home to large numbers of Orthodox Jews, an eruv has existed since the 1970s with little controversy, and, as the Jewish population increased, was extended to nearby <a href="Bogota%2C%20New%20Jersey">Bogota</a> and <a href="Bergenfield%2C%20New%20Jersey">Bergenfield</a>. Other eruvin in Bergen County are in <a href="Fair%20Lawn%2C%20New%20Jersey">Fair Lawn</a> and in <a href="Paramus%2C%20New%20Jersey">Paramus</a>.

A previous instance in which an eruv had been constructed in Bergen County, and had been challenged by local authorities, occurred in <a href="Tenafly%2C%20New%20Jersey">Tenafly</a>, in the eastern part of the county. Attempts by municipal authorities to ban eruvin had failed when challenged in the federal courts, and the settlement in 2006 after a six-year battle obliged the borough to pay $325,000 for the eruv association's legal costs. In most cases involving conflict over whether an eruv should be permitted, the municipality has lost and the construction of the eruv allowed to continue.

Orthodox Jews in Rockland County gained a license from <a href="Orange%20and%20Rockland%20Utilities">Orange and Rockland Utilities</a> (which serves parts of both Rockland County in New York and Bergen County in New Jersey) to construct an eruv using its utility poles in 2015, and in March 2017 the company granted permission for the South <a href="Monsey%2C%20New%20York">Monsey</a> Eruv Fund to install lechis, made from white <a href="PVC">PVC</a> pipe, on its utility poles in northwestern Bergen County. This was an extension of an existing eruv in Rockland County, and was intended to run through Mahwah, Upper Saddle River and Montvale. According to Rabbi Chaim Steinmetz, head of the eruv association, the purpose was to accommodate those living in Rockland County close to the border, near <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2059">New York State Route 59</a>. The boundaries had to be run through New Jersey due to the lack of a road along the state line. Mahwah police noted construction being done on utility poles in May and made inquiries. On learning that Orange and Rockland had authorized the work, they provided police protection, for which the department was paid about $2,000 by the eruv fund. The work in Mahwah was complete by June.

When the matter became generally known in mid-July, there was what local reporter Tom Nobile called a "firestorm of opposition" from local residents, with some expressing concerns that the eruv would allow Orthodox communities in Rockland County to expand into New Jersey. Groups formed on <a href="social%20media">social media</a>, including one named Mahwah Strong, in opposition to the eruv. Mahwah Strong claimed 3,000 members within days; a founder, Robert Ferguson, stated that his group would act as a check and balance to ensure the township enforced its laws, and noted, "I don't view this as a hostile takeover of the town." Two hundred people gathered in a Mahwah park on July 22 to support the eruv's removal. An online petition to "Protect the Quality of Our Community in Mahwah", initiated by former township council member John Roth, reached 1,200 names before being taken down due to what Roth called inappropriate comments, made by some signers. Similarly, Mahwah Strong lost its <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> page following an influx of comments deemed "hateful".

In early July 2017, the eruv was completed in part of Upper Saddle River. Montvale acted first against the eruv, with Mayor Michael Ghassali issuing a stop work order on July 10, after the eruv association had rented equipment and arranged with local police to provide security. Montvale authorities objected on the grounds that the lechis constituted a sign, forbidden by <a href="local%20ordinance">borough ordinance</a>. This was done prior to construction with the result that the eruv did not extend into Montvale. On July 18, Upper Saddle River's attorney sent a letter demanding the removal of the lechis that had been erected there, with a deadline of July 26, but the borough agreed to let them remain for the time being after two New York State residents filed suit in the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20New%20Jersey">United States District Court for the District of New Jersey</a> in Newark, requesting a <a href="temporary%20restraining%20order">temporary restraining order</a> against the borough and Mayor Joanne Minichetti. The borough's agreement was in exchange for an undertaking from the eruv association not to expand the eruv, and the motion for a restraining order was withdrawn. The eruv was vandalized on July 26 and 27, requiring immediate repair work. Mahwah's township engineer, Mike Kelly, sent a letter to the eruv association on July 21, taking a stance similar to Montvale's, and demanding the removal of the eruv by August 4. Mayor Bill Laforet stated, "This sends a very strong message to those who choose to violate our sign ordinances."

On June 29, the Mahwah Township Council had passed an ordinance, effective July 27, barring nonresidents of New Jersey from its parks. Residents had complained that out-of-staters were flooding Mahwah's parks, sometimes by the busload. After the ordinance passed, but before it went into effect, Mahwah police chief James Batelli received many phone calls from residents asking that it be enforced against Orthodox Jews. He contacted the Bergen County Prosecutor, <a href="Gurbir%20Grewal">Gurbir Grewal</a>, for advice. On July 27, the date the ordinance was to go into effect, Grewal issued a directive ordering Mahwah police to disregard the ban, stating that the ban could lead to racial profiling, unlawful searches and seizures and the illegal targeting of Orthodox Jews. In response, Rob Hermansen, president of the township council, stated that that body would rework the ordinance to continue putting Mahwah residents first.

When the Mahwah Township Council met on the evening of July 27, it did so before an overflow crowd. Despite warnings from the township attorney not to discuss issues of religion, some did. Others complained of nonresidents crowding parks, and that they had been visited by people wanting to buy their homes. The lawyer for Mahwah Strong urged the council to enforce the law by requiring the takedown of the eruv. Ferguson was quoted as saying at the meeting, "We do not want these people living in our neighborhoods. We want them following the law."

As the eruv controversy intensified, Mahwah and Montvale, as well as neighboring boroughs, enacted or made stricter ordinances restricting those making unsolicited offers to buy houses from knocking on doors. Municipal officials stated that this was being done because of the concerns of residents, who feared the Orthodox moving in would result in a population explosion, that the schools would suffer, and high-density housing built. Residents cited <a href="Lakewood%2C%20New%20Jersey">Lakewood</a> in <a href="Ocean%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Ocean County</a> as an example of such problems.

To a standing ovation from some 200 residents in attendance, the Mahwah council on August 10 unanimously voted to issue <a href="summons">summons</a>es because the eruv had not been taken down. Mayor Laforet, though, urged the council not to take this step, pointing to the large expense the unsuccessful eruv litigation had cost Tenafly, and advocated negotiation. In response to the council's action, the Bergen-Rockland Eruv Association (of which the South Monsey group is a part) and several Orthodox Jews resident in Rockland County filed suit in federal court against Mahwah on August 11, and promised to defy any summonses. Residents of Teaneck and <a href="Englewood%2C%20New%20Jersey">Englewood</a>, each in southeastern Bergen County and home to large communities of Orthodox Jews, had gone to Mahwah and Upper Saddle River to make known their views at council meetings. Council members from Teaneck and Englewood had spoken there in support of the eruv's retention, only to meet a hostile reception. Citizens for a Better Upper Saddle River posted a screenshot of the Teaneck council schedule online, urging members to mark their calendars with the dates. Council member Mark Schwartz of Teaneck stated that visitors would be welcome, and could view how a diverse community functioned. Michael Cohen of the Englewood council stated, "We have repeatedly attempted to communicate to the leadership of Upper Saddle River and Mahwah why it is that the rhetoric and actions being seen and taken by certain members of their governing bodies and by certain members of their communities are being viewed by the outside world as anti-Semitic. However, those attempts have largely continued to fall on deaf ears."

Following failed settlement negotiations and a closed-door council meeting on October 10, the Bergen-Rockland Eruv Association and individual plaintiffs sued Montvale on October 18, alleging that Mayor Ghassali's stop work order inhibited them in practicing their religion. They cited a 2015 statement from then-mayor Roger Fyfe, from when rumors of an eruv had first circulated, that an eruv was a simple accommodation and a matter in which the borough had only a slight part. The plaintiffs also alleged that Mahwah and Upper Saddle River were aware of the eruv construction, but had no problem with it until they gave in to a campaign of xenophobia and anti-Semitism. The next day, the Democratic candidate for governor, <a href="Phil%20Murphy">Phil Murphy</a>, accused the residents of Mahwah of causing an "overarching perception of anti-Semitism and discrimination". According to Murphy, "When a Holocaust survivor at a public meeting is heckled, and then denounced as a fraud, there is a problem. When well-intentioned residents are disparaged as 'paid actors' for a 'Jewish money conspiracy scheme' there is a problem."

On October 24, the <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20New%20Jersey">Attorney General of New Jersey</a>, <a href="Christopher%20Porrino">Christopher Porrino</a>, sued Mahwah and its council, alleging that by voting for the parks ban and for the summonses, they had violated the constitutional rights of Orthodox Jews. The case, filed in <a href="New%20Jersey%20Superior%20Court">state court</a> in <a href="Hackensack%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hackensack</a>, sought nullification of the council's actions, statutory penalties, attorney's fees, and the return of $3.5 million in state-provided Green Acres funds with which Mahwah had purchased and maintained parks. Under the Green Acres program, parks benefitting from the funds may not discriminate, including on the basis of religion or residency. Porrino stated, "To think that there are local governments here in New Jersey, in 2017, making laws on the basis of some archaic, fear-driven and discriminatory mindset, is deeply disappointing and shocking to many, but it is exactly what we are alleging in this case. Of course, in this case we allege the target of the small-minded bias is not African-Americans, but Orthodox Jews. Nonetheless, the hateful message is the same." Mayor Laforet accused Council President Hermansen of fear-mongering and stoking passions, "His disgraceful behavior is now worsened by the severe potential financial penalties facing the township's taxpayer." In the municipal election on November 7, Mahwah voters easily re-elected two anti-eruv council members, defeating challengers supported by Laforet. The case was removed from state to federal court by Mahwah on November 22 as it raised questions under <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">the federal constitution</a>. On December 1, the council voted unanimously to allocate $175,000 to fight the lawsuits, which supplemented the $90,000 previously appropriated.

In the Upper Saddle River case, on October 10, 2017, the eruv association moved for a <a href="preliminary%20injunction">preliminary injunction</a> allowing the eruv to remain pending the outcome of the litigation. In support, the association provided documentation showing that Mayor Minichetti had told the borough council about the proposed eruv in 2015, and the new sign ordinance had rapidly followed. In response to the motion, filed on November 2, Upper Saddle River stated that the sign law was tightened because of a divisive municipal election in 2014, that had seen many signs. The borough argued that the lawsuit was premature, as the eruv association had not sought permission. It argued that it had not violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs; its sign ordinance was content-neutral, banning all signs of whatever sort, and thus the plaintiffs had not been discriminated against. It alleged that permission to erect the lechis from Orange and Rockland was insufficient; the eruv association also had to comply with local law, and in any event the communications company <a href="Verizon">Verizon</a> had joint use of the poles and had not been asked for consent. Upper Saddle River distinguished its situation from that of Tenafly, stating that in Tenafly, exceptions had been made to the sign ordinance, but in Upper Saddle River it had been strictly enforced. Towards the end of December, Montvale Mayor Ghassali indicated that his borough was negotiating with the plaintiffs, seeking to reach an amicable settlement of the federal lawsuit.

Murphy was elected governor in November and designated Bergen County Prosecutor Grewal as the new Attorney General. Thus, once they took office, opponents of Mahwah's position would hold powerful posts in the state capital of <a href="Trenton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Trenton</a>, and municipal officials began to have second thoughts about whether to fight the eruv. On December 14, 2017, following the advice of legal counsel, the Mahwah council repealed the still-unenforced ban on out-of-state park users, and abandoned an attempt to amend the sign ordinance to bar "other matter" (the lechis) from being affixed to utility poles. The "other matter" language would have imitated the 2015 changes to the Upper Saddle River sign law which had followed Minichetti informing the borough council about the plans for the eruv, and was withdrawn, according to Hermansen, lest Mahwah's motives be misinterpreted. The vote to repeal the park ban was unanimous, with one council member absent. After the vote, Laforet called the ordinances "ill-advised" before being silenced by the council. He resumed outside the council chamber and disclosed that the members could have faced prosecution. "They are hiding from you that if they failed to do so, the Attorney General can come into Mahwah to press civil or criminal bias charges. For people who did a lot of shouting, and shouting down the past several months, they are strangely quiet about that."

The Upper Saddle River lawsuit was scheduled for argument before Judge <a href="John%20Michael%20Vazquez">John Michael Vazquez</a> of the federal court for New Jersey. When he convened that hearing on January 9, 2018, rather than hear the lawyers argue the positions set forth in the legal briefs, Judge Vazquez told them his views. He questioned whether the borough had consistently enforced the ordinance, as plaintiffs' lawyers had discovered a number of signs and even mailboxes attached to utility poles, that Upper Saddle River had not taken down. The judge voiced his skepticism that the 2015 sign ordinance had been passed because of a contentious municipal election the previous year, as the borough maintained, and indicated that he was inclined to believe it was passed because of the eruv. He urged Upper Saddle River to try to settle the case, and to do so in coordination with the other two municipalities—he was also presiding judge in those cases.

On January 30, 2018, the Mahwah council voted 5–2 to accept a negotiated settlement of the eruv litigation, despite some residents who urged the council to fight all the way to the Supreme Court. Council President Hermansen supported the deal as the best possible outcome, "We're trying to do the right thing. This is a good town with good people, and we're making this decision for good people." He wrote on Facebook that Mahwah "should be known more for our open space, parks and our overall community than the negative comments made about our residents from outsiders." The terms of the settlement were not announced at that meeting as the deal was still pending agreement by the plaintiffs, but were disclosed the following day. The eruv is to remain, but the lechis were to be painted to match the pole, or replaced with ones of that color, The township was to pay the association $10,000 or such other sum as mutually agreed for legal fees. The association may expand the eruv, but is to consult with the council before doing so. On February 7, a public meeting that was called for that day to discuss the terms of the settlement was postponed to a future date on the advice of the township's attorneys.

Montvale also undertook negotiations with the eruv association plaintiffs. Some Montvale residents sought to minimize the land covered by the eruv within the borough by having the boundary run through backyards close to the state line, but the consent of all landowners could not be obtained. On February 13, the Montvale council voted to approve a settlement whereby the eruv boundary would be placed on streets in the northern part of the borough, and efforts will be made to reroute it through private land. Montvale will pay the eruv association attorneys at Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP $10,000 towards legal costs and be shielded from further lawsuits from it for two years. Yehudah Buchweitz, an attorney for the eruv association, stated: "Our lawsuit against Montvale was filed to permit an eruv in a small portion of Montvale, so families could enjoy the same religious freedom as so many others throughout Bergen and Rockland counties and beyond. This settlement preserves and protects the people's right to have an eruv." A map showing the eruv boundary's route through Montvale was posted on the borough website on March 1, 2018.
After a closed-door meeting, the Upper Saddle River Borough Council voted on January 15 to attempt to reach a settlement with the plaintiffs. On February 21, the borough announced over its <a href="emergency%20notification%20system">emergency notification system</a> that it had reached a tentative agreement whereby the eruv boundary would be run along the roads until it could be relocated as close to the state line as possible. The borough stated that the agreement was being entered into "because of a variety of reasons outside of the Borough’s control, including the recent settlements by Mahwah and Montvale". The borough agreed to pay $75,000 towards the eruv association's legal costs. The agreement went into force on April 5, 2018. Under the agreement, 12 poles are to be erected on the municipal right-of-way to allow the eruv boundary to run on a shortened route through the borough, close to the state line. The lechis are to be made of black plastic, and the eruv association may not ask for a change of route for three years.

On February 15, 2018, Judge Vazquez accepted the Mahwah and Montvale settlements, and on April 19, that of Upper Saddle River. He retains continuing jurisdiction over the matters, and they can be re-opened if a dispute arises. A temporary eruv boundary was run across the original Upper Saddle River route, pending a final routing. On July 17, 2018, Upper Saddle River posted maps and stated that work on implementing the settlement would occur over the following several weeks.
In September 2018, a settlement between the Attorney General and Mahwah was announced. The township is to repeal the two controversial ordinances and agreed not to enact the new sign ordinance and to notify the Attorney General of any proposed legislation on these subjects for the following four years. The mayor and council are to issue a joint statement affirming that the existing sign ordinance, and those dealing with parks and recreation, will be enforced in a nondiscriminatory manner. A breach by Mahwah within the four-year period could result in penalties of $100,000; a proposed $350,000 fine was suspended.

On November 6, 2018, Mahwah voters <a href="recall%20election">recalled</a> Laforet from office, electing John Roth in his place. Hermansen was defeated for re-election, with Robert Ferguson among those elected to the new council.

United States Sesquicentennial coinage

The United States Sesquicentennial coin issue consisted of a commemorative <a href="half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollar</a> and <a href="quarter%20eagle">quarter eagle</a> (gold $2.50 piece) struck in 1926 at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> for the 150th anniversary of <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">American independence</a>. The <a href="obverse">obverse</a> of the half dollar features portraits of the first president, <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>, and the president in 1926, <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>, making it the only American coin to depict a president in his lifetime.

By the March 1925 <a href="Act%20of%20Congress">Act of Congress</a>, by which the National Sesquicentennial Exhibition Commission was chartered, Congress also allowed it to purchase 1,000,000 specially designed half dollars and 200,000 quarter eagles, which could be sold to the public at a premium. The Commission had trouble agreeing on a design with Mint Chief Engraver <a href="John%20R.%20Sinnock">John R. Sinnock</a>, and asked <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> attorney, arts patron and <a href="numismatist">numismatist</a> John Frederick Lewis (1860–1932) to submit sketches. These were adapted by Sinnock, without giving credit to Lewis, whose involvement would not be generally known for forty years.

Both the quarter eagle, designed by Sinnock, and the half dollar were struck in the maximum number authorized, but many were returned to the Mint for melting when they failed to sell. The <a href="Liberty%20Bell">Liberty Bell</a> reverse for the half dollar was later reused by Sinnock, again without giving Lewis credit, on the Chief Engraver's <a href="Franklin%20half%20dollar">Franklin half dollar</a>, which was first minted in 1948.

Legislation for a <a href="commemorative%20coin">commemorative coin</a> to mark the 150th anniversary of American independence was introduced on behalf of the United States National Sesquicentennial Exhibition Commission, which was charged with organizing what became known as the <a href="Sesquicentennial%20Exposition">Sesquicentennial Exposition</a> in Philadelphia. In the Act of March 3, 1925, Congress both chartered the Commission and allowed one million half dollars and 200,000 quarter eagles to be struck in commemoration of the Sesquicentennial of American Independence. These coins would be sold only to the Commission, at face value; it could then retail them to the public at a premium. Profits would go to financing the Exposition.

The original version of the bill, introduced in the House of Representatives on February 16, 1925 by Pennsylvania Congressman <a href="George%20P.%20Darrow">George P. Darrow</a> and in the Senate by that state's <a href="George%20W.%20Pepper">George W. Pepper</a>, called for a $1.50 gold coin for the 150th anniversary, for commemorative half dollars, and for a $1 bill honoring the Declaration of Independence. A hearing was held before the House Committee on Industrial Arts and Expositions two days later, at which Congressman Darrow predicted that the $1.50 gold pieces would not be opposed by either the Treasury or the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, but he was incorrect; Treasury Secretary <a href="Andrew%20W.%20Mellon">Andrew W. Mellon</a> would not support them. The Commission also hoped to have commemoratives depicting the enlargement of the country through acquisitions such as the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a> and the <a href="Annexation%20of%20Texas">Annexation of Texas</a>, but these were not included in the final version of the bill. Nevertheless, the Commission continued to pursue congressional approval of the $1.50 piece and the other proposed commemoratives at least through August 1925.

In May, H. P. Caemmerer, secretary of the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>, a body charged with making recommendations on the approval of coinage design, wrote to the Sesquicentennial Commission, asking what they proposed to do about the coins. Having received no reply, he wrote again in late August, this time to <a href="Milton%20Medary">Milton Medary</a>, a member of the Fine Arts Commission, asking what progress had been made. Medary replied that the Sesquicentennial Commission was in touch with the new Chief Engraver at the Philadelphia Mint, <a href="John%20R.%20Sinnock">John R. Sinnock</a> (his predecessor, <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">George T. Morgan</a>, had died in January), but that Sinnock had not yet submitted satisfactory designs.

Apparently dissatisfied with Sinnock's work, the Sesquicentennial Commission hired John Frederick Lewis to create designs. Lewis, who served as president of the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Academy%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts</a> from 1906 until his death in 1932, was known as a numismatist, but not as an artist. On December 8, 1925, Sesquicentennial Commission director Asher C. Baker submitted Lewis's sketches, which appear much like the present half dollar, to Fine Arts Commission chairman Charles Moore. Baker referred to Lewis's "designs for the coins", which may mean that he submitted sketches for the quarter eagle as well, but if so, they are not extant and were not acted upon by the Fine Arts Commission. The half dollar designs were approved by the Fine Arts Commission, on condition the sketches were converted into models by a competent sculptor, and Moore sent them on December 11 to Mint Director <a href="Robert%20J.%20Grant">Robert J. Grant</a>. The resultant plaster models, made by Sinnock, were submitted to the Fine Arts Commission on March 13, 1926, and were undoubtedly endorsed, but the approval letter is lost.

Sinnock's sketches for the quarter eagle were sent to the Fine Arts Commission on February 27, 1926, and were forwarded to sculptor member <a href="Lorado%20Taft">Lorado Taft</a> for his views. Moore sent his commission's approval to Grant on March 26, with several recommendations, including that the motto "<a href="E%20Pluribus%20Unum">E Pluribus Unum</a>", present on the obverse in Sinnock's sketches, and the sun's rays on the reverse, be omitted. The rays were not removed, and the motto was moved to the reverse. Approval of the models followed in April, again with minor suggestions.

The obverse of the half dollar features <a href="jugate">jugate</a> busts of <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>, first president of the United States, and <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>, the president in 1926. According to Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, "both were mistakes. Washington was not president of the <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Continental Congress</a> in 1776, and Coolidge's likeness was illegal. By an 1866 Act of Congress, no living person could be portrayed on U.S. coins or currency; but this law had been many times violated and would be again." Although Sinnock had not previously designed a coin showing a president, he had created presidential medals under Chief Engraver Morgan's direction. Other living Americans, including Virginia Senator <a href="Carter%20Glass">Carter Glass</a>, have appeared on commemorative coinage, but Coolidge is the only president to appear on a U.S. coin in his lifetime. The <a href="Liberty%20Bell">Liberty Bell</a> appears on the reverse, making the Sesquicentennial half dollar the first U.S. coin to bear private advertising—that is, the legend "Pass and Stow" on the bell, for the long-defunct partnership of John Pass and John Stow, who recast the bell after it initially broke in 1752. Sinnock's initials JRS are on the obverse, on the truncation of Washington's bust.
Swiatek and Breen describe the obverse of the quarter eagle as "very <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a>". <a href="Liberty%20%28goddess%29">Liberty</a> appears on it, wearing a <a href="pileus%20%28hat%29">liberty cap</a> and holding both a scroll representing the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">United States Declaration of Independence</a> and a torch likely intended to recall the <a href="Statue%20of%20Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>. The reverse depicts <a href="Independence%20Hall%20%28United%20States%29">Independence Hall</a>, where the Declaration was signed, and the rising sun behind it. Sinnock's initials are to the right, above the right wing of the building. Bowers pointed out that the depiction of Independence Hall closely resembles that on the <a href="United%20States%20Bicentennial%20coinage">Bicentennial</a> half dollar, struck a half century later. As no clock hands are seen on the bell tower of the building on the quarter eagle, it is not possible to say what time is intended—on the Bicentennial half dollar, the time is 3:00.

At the insistence of the Sesquicentennial Commission, the coins were minted in very shallow relief, and thus struck up poorly. Coin dealer and numismatic author <a href="Q.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BDavid%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> opined, "from the standpoint of aesthetic appeal the [half dollar] is at the bottom of the popularity charts along with the 1923-S <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine%20Centennial%20half%20dollar">Monroe half dollar</a>".

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> took a more positive view of the two coins. Commenting on the half dollar obverse, he praised its technical aspects, showing the Mint had learned something from earlier attempts at coin redesign. He admired the reverse, calling the bell and the lettering "jewels of precision". For the quarter eagle obverse, with its figure of a robed Liberty standing on a globe, Vermeule suggested that Sinnock "revert[ed] in part to the allegorical iconography of the nineteenth century." He felt that the Liberty allegory is too blatant, with scroll and torch, and noted that Sinnock eventually found a more proper place for his torch on the <a href="Roosevelt%20dime">Roosevelt dime</a> (1946). The figure itself, despite classical robes, "looks more like a 'flapper' of the 1920s. Her cloth cap accentuates this," according to Vermeule. The reverse, in Vermeule's view, was part of a tradition of realistic views of structures on U.S coins that would repeat itself with the <a href="Jefferson%20nickel">Jefferson nickel</a> (1938).

The first Sesquicentennial half dollar was coined by Philadelphia Mayor <a href="W.%20Freeland%20Kendrick">W. Freeland Kendrick</a> at a special ceremony at that city's mint on May 19, 1926. It was presented to President Coolidge when he visited the Exposition and today rests in the <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge%20Presidential%20Library%20and%20Museum">Calvin Coolidge Presidential Library and Museum</a>. Lewis, in a May 5 letter to Mint Director Grant, had indicated his (mistaken) understanding that a mark was placed on the first 1,000 coins struck to distinguish them and proposed that it be "K" for Kendrick; this was not done.

The Philadelphia Mint coined 1,000,528 of the half dollars at the behest of the Commission in May and June 1926, with the excess over the authorized mintage reserved for inspection and testing at the 1927 meeting of the <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">United States Assay Commission</a>. They also had the mint strike 200,226 quarter eagles in May and June, with the excess also set aside for the Assay Commission. The gold piece was the second quarter eagle to be a commemorative, after the <a href="Panama%E2%80%93Pacific%20commemorative%20coins">Panama–Pacific issue</a> of 1915. No further gold commemoratives, of any denomination, would be issued by the Mint Bureau until 1984, when a $10 piece was issued for the <a href="1984%20Summer%20Olympics">Los Angeles Olympics</a>.

The Sesquicentennial Exposition opened in Philadelphia on June 1, 1926, financed in part by $5 million in bonds floated by the city. Work had not been completed on many of the exhibits and construction continued to the close of the fair. Nevertheless, there were many scientific, artistic, and commercial displays. Most firms that exhibited lost money by their participation, as did the city, and according to Bowers, "in the annals of fairs and expositions in the United States, the Sesquicentennial event earns a low rating."

Sales of coins at the Exposition were handled by the Commission; those by mail were dealt with by the <a href="Franklin%20Trust%20Company">Franklin Trust Company</a>. The half dollar was priced at $1, and the quarter eagle at $4; however they did not sell well and the Commission's belief it could sell the entire mintage proved wildly optimistic. Although six million people visited the Exposition, 859,408 of the 1,000,000 half dollars were returned to the mint for melting. Similarly, 154,207 quarter eagles of the mintage of 200,000 were returned for melting. This did not take place all at once: 420,000 half dollars had been returned by January 1930, with the rest later. According to coin dealer B. Max Mehl in his 1937 volume on commemoratives, "Philadelphia with a population of over 2,000,000 people ... could and should have sold a greater number of coins". Arlie R. Slabaugh wrote in his 1975 book on the same subject, "we have been called complacent about our independence and the American way of life in recent years—judging by the sale of these coins, it must have been much worse in 1926!"

Sinnock reused the reverse for the <a href="Franklin%20half%20dollar">Franklin half dollar</a>, first struck in 1948, the year after his death. Mint and other publications gave credit for both coins' designs only to Sinnock until <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a> published his "An Illustrated History of U.S. Commemorative Coinage" in 1967, disclosing Lewis's involvement. Taxay referred to "the Mint's ... final, deliberate misattribution of the artist who designed the half dollar" and wrote, "perhaps after these forty years, it is time for a new credit line". Bowers noted, "Lewis and Sinnock should share the credit." <a href="R.%20S.%20Yeoman">R. S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" (2015 edition) notes the involvement of both men, and values the half dollar at $90, with the quarter eagle beginning at around $450, though <a href="Coin%20grading">higher-graded</a> coins may sell for more. Many are known in circulated condition.

Mind Meld

Mind Meld: Secrets Behind the Voyage of a Lifetime is a 2001 American <a href="documentary%20film">documentary film</a> in which actors <a href="William%20Shatner">William Shatner</a> and <a href="Leonard%20Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a> discuss the "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>" <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> franchise and its effects on their lives. Shatner and Nimoy portrayed the characters <a href="James%20T.%20Kirk">James T. Kirk</a> and <a href="Spock">Spock</a> respectively in the , the , and <a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%20series%29">their film sequels</a>. They talk about differences they had with <a href="Gene%20Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a>, the creator of "Star Trek", and about the strained relationships between Shatner and some of the other cast members. It was in this film that Nimoy first publicly revealed that he had struggled with <a href="alcoholism">alcoholism</a> while he was acting in the original television series. Shatner talks about the death of his third wife, Nerine Kidd, who accidentally drowned in a pool in 1999 after suffering from alcoholism.

"Mind Meld" was produced to advertise Shatner's personal website. Filming took place at Nimoy's home on September 5, 2001, and <a href="Billy%20West">Billy West</a> narrated the <a href="title%20sequence">title sequence</a>. The film's title refers to a fictional practice in "Star Trek"—a <a href="Vulcan%20%28Star%20Trek%29%23Mind%20melds">mind meld</a> is a <a href="Telepathy">telepathic</a> link that <a href="Vulcan%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Vulcans</a> are able to create with other organisms. "Mind Meld" was released for sale on Shatner's website on November 6, 2001, coinciding with the release of the <a href="director%27s%20cut">director's cut</a> of "". "Mind Meld" attracted some notoriety because of an unintended sound in one scene that became a popular subject of <a href="flatulence%20humor">flatulence humor</a> among <a href="Trekkie">"Star Trek" fans</a> and on <a href="morning%20zoo">morning zoo</a> radio programs. Shatner denied being the source of this sound in multiple interviews; he and "Mind Meld"'s director, Peter Jaysen, attributed it to equipment on set.

The film received mixed reviews from critics. Scott Brown of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" gave the film an "F", and said that the only people likely to watch the film were extreme "Star Trek" fans and people interested in hearing Shatner's supposed flatulence. Laurence Lerman of "Video Business" praised the film for not "rehash[ing] anecdotes that have long been staples of "Star Trek" conventions and behind-the-scenes memoirs", and instead for dealing with such topics as alcoholism, career difficulties, and conflicts on the set of "Star Trek".

<a href="William%20Shatner">William Shatner</a> and <a href="Leonard%20Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a> respectively portrayed <a href="James%20T.%20Kirk">James T. Kirk</a> and <a href="Spock">Spock</a> in "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>", first in the 1960s television series (later retitled ""), then in the 1970s television series "", and subsequently in several <a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%20series%29">"Star Trek" films</a> between 1979 and 1994. In "Mind Meld", they discuss the "Star Trek" <a href="media%20franchise">media franchise</a> and its enduring success. The film is, except for the <a href="title%20sequence">title sequence</a>, composed entirely of Shatner and Nimoy in conversation. Many of the topics they discuss were inspired by online questions from fans. The film starts in Nimoy's backyard, where the two sit on patio chairs, and then moves into Nimoy's library, which is filled with souvenirs.
The film focuses on the effects "Star Trek" had on the lives of Shatner and Nimoy, with each actor interviewing the other about his fame. They talk about "Star Trek"s origins and the death of <a href="DeForest%20Kelley">DeForest Kelley</a>, who had portrayed <a href="Leonard%20McCoy">Leonard McCoy</a> in both "The Original Series" and "The Animated Series". Shatner and Nimoy also discuss interactions between themselves and others on the set of "Star Trek", including conflicts. Both Shatner and Nimoy describe having had strained relationships with <a href="Gene%20Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a>, the creator of "Star Trek", and attest to other members of the "Original Series" cast disliking Shatner. Only one of these cast members is referred to by name: <a href="Nichelle%20Nichols">Nichelle Nichols</a>, who portrayed <a href="Uhura">Nyota Uhura</a>. "I never fully comprehended what it was that was bothering them", says Shatner.

Both men describe "Star Trek" as having put personal pressures on them that negatively affected their family lives. The conversation is mostly guided by Shatner, who prompts Nimoy to discuss issues he had regarding the legitimacy of consistently portraying an <a href="Extraterrestrial%20life">extraterrestrial</a>, and other struggles with his acting career at the time. "It took me a while," Nimoy says, "but I got rid of all that anger when I realized that I never had to worry about work ever since "Star Trek" went on the air." Nimoy reveals that he was an <a href="Alcoholism">alcoholic</a> at the time of the original "Star Trek" series—something that was not publicly known before "Mind Meld". He developed "a major drinking habit, probably during the second or third year" of the series, he says, and had his secretary bring him alcohol in paper cups at the end of each day of filming. Nimoy suggests that he became dependent on alcohol because of the deterioration of his marriage to <a href="Sandra%20Zober">Sandra Zober</a>, his first wife. He says that, since divorcing Zober in 1987 and marrying actress <a href="Susan%20Bay">Susan Bay</a> in 1988, he has been a <a href="Teetotalism">teetotaler</a>.

Shatner says that acting in "Star Trek" was "life-consuming" and left him "barely any time for family", and that this was the reason for his divorce from Gloria Rand, his first wife. He describes a subsequent succession of sexual partners, including, he says, "Star Trek" actresses. He also talks about the death of his father, Joseph Shatner, and of his third wife, <a href="Nerine%20Kidd">Nerine Kidd</a>, who accidentally drowned in a pool in 1999, losing a battle with alcoholism. Shatner recalls that Nimoy had expressed concern about Kidd's alcoholism and warned him about marrying her. Another topic is Nimoy's <a href="fine-art%20photography">fine-art photography</a>, which deals with spirituality and sensuality. Both Shatner and Nimoy say that, while they are glad that "Star Trek" became successful, they wish their subsequent fame had encroached less on their privacy. They also describe having been <a href="Typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecast</a> as a result of their roles in "Star Trek", and say that this has had repercussions on their respective acting careers. Shatner recounts his initial surprise that, at <a href="science%20fiction%20convention">science fiction convention</a>s, the fans seem to like each other more than they like the <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> actors. The film concludes with Nimoy putting his arm around Shatner's shoulder and saying, "You're my best friend."

"Mind Meld" was produced as a way of advertising Shatner's personal website, williamshatner.com, which offered features including the Shatner and Friends fan club's quarterly newsletter, semi-regular updates on Shatner's life, and a photograph of Shatner with the gorilla <a href="Koko%20%28gorilla%29">Koko</a>. Shatner said that another reason they decided to make the film was because Nimoy was visibly getting old. Shatner asked Nimoy if he would be willing to discuss his experiences with alcoholism in the film, and Nimoy agreed. Nimoy later said that no one had ever asked him about this part of his past, and that discussing it in "Mind Meld" "was an opportunity to put out some information that might be helpful to some people."

Filming took place on September 5, 2001, in <a href="high-definition%20video">high-definition video</a> at Nimoy's home, under the direction of Peter Jaysen. There was no script; the conversation between Shatner and Nimoy was "<a href="ad%20libitum">ad lib</a>". The title sequence of "Mind Meld" is narrated by veteran <a href="Voice%20acting">voice actor</a> <a href="Billy%20West">Billy West</a>, who had previously voiced such characters as <a href="List%20of%20Invader%20Zim%20characters%23Zim">Zim</a> in the television series "<a href="Invader%20Zim">Invader Zim</a>", Ralph in "<a href="Joe%27s%20Apartment">Joe's Apartment</a>", and <a href="Elmer%20Fudd">Elmer Fudd</a> in "". While the filming session resulted in approximately two hours of footage, a significant portion of this was not used, resulting in a final runtime of 75 minutes. In an interview with science fiction magazine "<a href="Starlog">Starlog</a>", Shatner said, "I don't think... that anything was cut because it was too personal or inflammatory. Edits were only made for time." The title of the film refers to a fictional practice in "Star Trek"; a <a href="Vulcan%20%28Star%20Trek%29%23Mind%20melds">mind meld</a> is a <a href="Telepathy">telepathic</a> link that Spock is able to create with other organisms because he is part <a href="Vulcan%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Vulcan</a>. Shatner summarized the film as being "two friends talking one-on-one".

"Mind Meld" was released on VHS and DVD for sale on Shatner's website on November 6, 2001, coinciding with the release of the <a href="director%27s%20cut">director's cut</a> of "", a film that Shatner and Nimoy agreed was not as good as they had hoped it would be. "Mind Meld" was produced by <a href="Creative%20Light%20Entertainment">Creative Light Entertainment</a>, a company that produced another filmed interview the following year—"<a href="Stan%20Lee%27s%20Mutants%2C%20Monsters%20%26amp%3B%20Marvels">Stan Lee's Mutants, Monsters & Marvels</a>", an interview of <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel Comics</a> publisher <a href="Stan%20Lee">Stan Lee</a> by film director <a href="Kevin%20Smith">Kevin Smith</a>. The "Mind Meld" DVD offers <a href="widescreen">widescreen</a> and fullscreen options, <a href="Dolby%20Digital">Dolby Digital</a> surround sound, and a five-minute "making of" featurette. "Mind Meld" T-shirts were available on Shatner's website. The film's release prompted <a href="Wil%20Wheaton">Wil Wheaton</a>, who had portrayed <a href="Wesley%20Crusher">Wesley Crusher</a> in "", to change the name of his comic science fiction <a href="List%20of%20improvisational%20theatre%20companies">improvisational theatre company</a> from "Mind Meld" to "EarnestBorg9".

Shatner referred to "The Original Series" as "cartoonish" in "Mind Meld", but later, upon questioning by a reporter, said, "I never thought it was a cartoon ... I never thought it was beneath me." In a February 2002 interview on "<a href="Larry%20King%20Live">Larry King Live</a>", Shatner said "Mind Meld" was similar to "<a href="My%20Dinner%20with%20Andre">My Dinner with Andre</a>", and indicated that he and Nimoy were hoping to produce more films of a similar nature. Nimoy said of the film, "This is the most personal insight the fans will get into our relationship and into aspects of Bill and myself they've never heard before." In April 2002, "Mind Meld" was screened at the <a href="Newport%20Beach%20Film%20Festival">Newport Beach Film Festival</a>. Two years later, "Mind Meld" was included in the bonus material when the first six "Star Trek" films were re-released as a special edition box set.

Around 52 minutes and 47 seconds into the film, when Shatner is talking about the other "Original Series" actors disliking him, he shifts in his chair and a sound evocative of flatulence is audible. This sound, apparently unnoticed by the filmmakers, was first mentioned in the media by Adam Buckman in the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" on October 10, 2001. Buckman wrote that he played the sound for more than six colleagues who all agreed that it came from Shatner. This scene became a popular subject of <a href="flatulence%20humor">flatulence humor</a> among <a href="Star%20Trek%20fandom">"Star Trek" fans</a> and on <a href="morning%20zoo">morning zoo</a> radio programs. Reviewers identified as many as six other similar noises in "Mind Meld", between the 52-minute mark and the end.

<a href="Howard%20Stern">Howard Stern</a> played the sound on <a href="The%20Howard%20Stern%20Show">his radio show</a> several times, including when Shatner appeared on the show to promote his upcoming television series "<a href="Iron%20Chef%20USA">Iron Chef USA</a>" on November 13, 2001. When Stern asked about the sound, Shatner said it had been produced by the <a href="Boom%20operator%20%28media%29">boom operator</a>. A similar claim was made on Shatner's website, where the noise was attributed to a squeaky <a href="Jib%20%28camera%29">jib</a>. On <a href="Conan%20O%27Brien">Conan O'Brien</a>'s "<a href="Late%20Night%20with%20Conan%20O%27Brien">Late Night</a>" program on November 14, Shatner called it "outrageous" that Buckman should assume him to be the source of the sound rather than Nimoy. O'Brien responded, "You're the captain! You outrank him! It's your responsibility!" Pressed further by O'Brien on the sound's provenance, Shatner suggested that it may have been a dog bark or a bird call. According to Jaysen, the sound did not emanate from Shatner, and was most likely caused by cables rubbing against each other while a camera moved. "It was probably some machine that nobody heard", Shatner said in a September 2002 interview. "The controversy is over."

Jim Dawson devoted an entire chapter of his 2006 "Modern History of the Fart" to Shatner's alleged flatulence in "Mind Meld", which he compares to the sound of someone stepping on a <a href="tribble">tribble</a>. G. Noel Gross of <a href="DVD%20Talk">DVD Talk</a> compared the excitement over this sound to that evinced by adolescent boys watching pornography, and compared the level of scrutiny devoted to the scene to that received by the <a href="Zapruder%20film">Zapruder film</a>.

Sarah Sloboda of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote that "Mind Meld" "provides a genuine glimpse of the lives of the stars shadowed by the roles that defined their public <a href="persona">persona</a>s, and the mutual experience that binds them as friends". Gross praised the <a href="video%20quality">video quality</a>, but criticized the DVD functionality and features. He also wrote that "even in the heavier parts of this conversation, there's a warmth and comradery there that's rife with good humor". Scott Brown of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" gave the film an F, saying that the only people likely to watch the film other than extreme "Star Trek" fans are people interested in hearing the sound alleged to be Shatner's flatulence, which Brown said can be clearly heard. He called the film "seemingly interminable" and said the discussion between Shatner and Nimoy shows that they "rival black holes in sheer self-absorption". According to John Henzell, writing for "<a href="The%20Press">The Press</a>" of New Zealand, "Mind Meld"s trailer took its subject matter so seriously that it became comical.

Vern Perry of the "<a href="Orange%20County%20Register">Orange County Register</a>" called the film fascinating, writing that it skilfully combined humor and earnestness. He wrote that it was moving to see the two actors talk about their personal lives with such vulnerability—particularly when Nimoy discusses his experiences with alcoholism. Greg Stacy of "<a href="OC%20Weekly">OC Weekly</a>" reported being "thoroughly charmed" by the film, and called "the affection between [Shatner and Nimoy] obvious and touching."

Laurence Lerman of "Video Business" praised "Mind Meld" for not "rehash[ing] anecdotes that have long been staples of "Star Trek" conventions and behind-the-scenes memoirs", but instead dealing with such topics as alcoholism, career difficulties, and conflicts on the set of "Star Trek". Mike Clark of "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" praised Shatner's interviewing abilities and wrote that the film was engaging. Clark called Shatner's and Nimoy's conversation "surprisingly frank", but added that Shatner was "full of himself". A review in British newspaper "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" summarized "Mind Meld" as "a couple of gents sitting around talking".

Sisters at Heart

"Sisters at Heart" is the thirteenth episode of the seventh season, and 213th episode overall, of the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">American Broadcasting Company</a> (ABC) <a href="fantasy%20television">fantasy television</a> sitcom "<a href="Bewitched">Bewitched</a>". This <a href="List%20of%20Christmas%20television%20specials">Christmas episode</a> aired on ABC on December 24, 1970, and again the following December.

The narrative follows Lisa Wilson (Venetta Rogers), an <a href="African%20American">African-American</a> girl, as she visits her friend <a href="List%20of%20Bewitched%20characters%23Tabitha%20Stephens">Tabitha Stephens</a> (<a href="Erin%20Murphy">Erin Murphy</a>), a <a href="White%20people">white</a> girl. Meanwhile, Tabitha's father <a href="List%20of%20Bewitched%20characters%23Darrin%20Stephens">Darrin Stephens</a> (<a href="Dick%20Sargent">Dick Sargent</a>), who works at an advertising agency, fails to land a million-dollar account with toy company owner Mr. Brockway (<a href="Parley%20Baer">Parley Baer</a>) because Mr. Brockway is racist and incorrectly believes Darrin to be married to Lisa's mother Dorothy (<a href="Janee%20Michelle">Janee Michelle</a>). In an attempt to convince Mr. Brockway to overcome his bigotry, Darrin's wife <a href="List%20of%20Bewitched%20characters%23Samantha%20Stephens">Samantha</a> (<a href="Elizabeth%20Montgomery">Elizabeth Montgomery</a>), who is a <a href="Witchcraft">witch</a>, casts a spell on Mr. Brockway so he sees everyone, including himself, as having <a href="Black%20people">black skin</a>.

The story of "Sisters at Heart" was written by 26 African-American students from a tenth grade <a href="English%20studies">English class</a> at <a href="Jefferson%20High%20School%20%28Los%20Angeles%29">Jefferson High School</a> after Montgomery and her husband <a href="William%20Asher">William Asher</a>, the director of the episode, had the students visit the set of "Bewitched". Most students at the school were unable to read, write, or comprehend at a high school level, with 44% reading at a third grade level and very few students reading at a level much higher than that. Sargent said that the students, "who might have been stuck in the ghetto for the rest of their lives, loved "Bewitched", and with just a little approval and motivation, came alive on the set." Montgomery considered "Sisters at Heart" her favorite episode of the series, and said that it "was created in the true spirit of Christmas ... conceived in the image of innocence and filled with truth." The episode received the Governors Award at the <a href="23rd%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">23rd Primetime Emmy Awards</a> ceremony in 1971. Montgomery's biographer Herbie Pilato wrote that "no episode of the series more clearly represented [the] cry against prejudice" than "Sisters at Heart". Critic Walter Metz praised Asher's choice of <a href="camera%20angle">camera angle</a>s, but denounced the episode's liberalism as excessively sentimental and simplistic.

Keith Wilson (<a href="Don%20Marshall%20%28actor%29">Don Marshall</a>), his wife Dorothy (<a href="Janee%20Michelle">Janee Michelle</a>), their daughter Lisa (Venetta Rogers), and Keith's boss, <a href="List%20of%20Bewitched%20characters%23Larry%20Tate">Larry Tate</a> (<a href="David%20White%20%28actor%29">David White</a>), visit the home of the Stephens family, with whom Lisa is to spend a few days while Keith is away on a business trip for Larry. The Wilsons are <a href="African%20American">African-American</a> and all of the other characters are white, including the Stephens family: <a href="List%20of%20Bewitched%20characters%23Darrin%20Stephens">Darrin</a> (<a href="Dick%20Sargent">Dick Sargent</a>), his wife <a href="List%20of%20Bewitched%20characters%23Samantha%20Stephens">Samantha</a> (<a href="Elizabeth%20Montgomery">Elizabeth Montgomery</a>), their daughter <a href="List%20of%20Bewitched%20characters%23Tabitha%20Stephens">Tabitha</a> (<a href="Erin%20Murphy">Erin Murphy</a>), and their son <a href="List%20of%20Bewitched%20characters%23Adam%20Stephens">Adam</a> (David Lawrence). Tabitha is glad to be able to spend a few days with Lisa and says they will temporarily be sisters. Darrin is another of Larry's employees at advertising agency McMann and Tate. Darrin is trying to land a million-dollar account from Mr. Brockway (<a href="Parley%20Baer">Parley Baer</a>), who owns a toy company. Mr. Brockway visits the Stephens residence unannounced to find out if Darrin has any dark secrets. When Mr. Brockway arrives, Samantha is tending to Adam upstairs, so Lisa answers the door. When Lisa says her father works for McMann and Tate and that she is Tabitha's sister, Mr. Brockway leaves, saying he has seen enough.

Samantha takes the children to the park, where another child tells Lisa and Tabitha that they cannot be sisters because they have different <a href="Human%20skin%20color">skin colors</a>. When they arrive home, Tabitha casts a spell on herself and Lisa so that Tabitha's skin has <a href="Black%20people">black</a> spots and Lisa's skin has <a href="White%20people">white</a> spots. Lisa thereby discovers that Tabitha and Samantha are <a href="Witchcraft">witches</a>. When Samantha finds the two girls <a href="Polka%20dot">polka-dotted</a>, she tells Tabitha to reverse the spell, which Tabitha unsuccessfully tries to do. Eventually, Samantha realizes that Tabitha's attempt was unsuccessful because Tabitha subconsciously wants the spots to remain so she and Lisa will continue to be sisters. Samantha tells the girls that differences in appearance won't prevent them from being sisters, and Tabitha then successfully reverses the spell just as Lisa's parents arrive to pick up Lisa.

Larry tells Darrin that Mr. Brockway has insisted that Darrin be removed from the account. Darrin and Samantha host a Christmas party which Larry, Keith, and Dorothy attend. When Mr. Brockway arrives, he sees Darrin and Dorothy standing next to each other and assumes they are married to each other. When Mr. Brockway realizes his mistake, and that Darrin is instead married to Samantha, Mr. Brockway tells Larry that he is willing to allow Darrin back on the account. After discovering that Mr. Brockway initially was unwilling because he thought Darrin was married to an African-American woman, Larry rejects Mr. Brockway's offer. Mr. Brockway expresses disbelief that anyone would reject such a lucrative account. Through witchcraft, Samantha causes Mr. Brockway to see everyone in the room, including himself, as having black skin. On Christmas Day, while the Wilsons are visiting the Stephens, Mr. Brockway arrives, apologizes for his previous actions, and repents of his racism. Samantha invites Mr. Brockway to join them for Christmas dinner, and he accepts.

In 1969, Marcella Saunders, a 23-year-old teacher at <a href="Jefferson%20High%20School%20%28Los%20Angeles%29">Jefferson High School</a> in Los Angeles, found that her ninth-grade students were unable to read the short stories and poetry in the class textbook. She thought that, because her students were more familiar with television than poetry or short stories, she would have more success in teaching her students if she taught them by way of a television series. She found that her students liked "<a href="Bewitched">Bewitched</a>", "<a href="Room%20222">Room 222</a>", and "<a href="Julia%20%28TV%20series%29">Julia</a>", so she contacted the corresponding television studios to tell them about her idea. Only "Bewitched" responded. Having gained an audience with Montgomery and her husband <a href="William%20Asher">William Asher</a>, Saunders told the couple that most students at the school were unable to read, write, or comprehend at a high school level, with 44% reading at a third grade level and very few students reading at a level much higher than that; less than 1% were reading at a ninth grade level. Saunders added that "Bewitched" was the students' favorite television series.

Out of concern for the students in Saunders' <a href="English%20studies">English class</a>, Montgomery and Asher invited Saunders' class of African-American students to visit the set of "Bewitched". Because many of these teenagers, now in the tenth grade, did not have the financial means to make their way to Hollywood, Montgomery and Asher paid for the class to be transported there and back by chartered bus. The students were impressed by the visit and later collaborated to write a <a href="teleplay">teleplay</a> for a "Bewitched" episode under Saunders' supervision. The teleplay was called "Sisters at Heart." At Christmas in 1969, they presented Montgomery and Asher with the teleplay, gift-wrapped. Montgomery and Asher were impressed with the quality of the script. Montgomery later said, "We've had bad scripts submitted by professional writers that weren't as well written or creative."

Asher told <a href="Barbara%20Avedon">Barbara Avedon</a> about the students' script, saying that it only needed a little reworking, and he asked if she would help the students with the rewrite. Avedon, who had written for "<a href="The%20Donna%20Reed%20Show">The Donna Reed Show</a>" and been a regular writer for "Bewitched", accepted his request. Avedon visited Jefferson High School and later said of the experience, "I was horrified. Locker doors were hanging off their hinges. There wasn't a blade of grass in sight." Avedon expressed amazement over the script the students produced and helped them revise it and expand its length so it would sustain a full half-hour episode. She promised the students that no changes would be made to the script unless they approved. It was because of her recommendation that the story was reformulated as a <a href="List%20of%20Christmas%20television%20specials">Christmas episode</a>, which she suggested because the script "was so imbued with the spirit." She said that one of the students indicated a desire to write for "Bewitched" because the series deals with <a href="miscegenation">miscegenation</a> by way of a marriage between a witch and a mortal. The final script credited the teleplay to Avedon and Asher, and the story to all 26 students, who were listed on screen in alphabetical order.

The students attended a production and rehearsal meeting for the episode. The <a href="government%20of%20California">government of California</a> gave Jefferson High School a grant to support a program to allow the students to be part of the filming and <a href="post-production">post-production</a> of the episode. Film production company <a href="Screen%20Gems">Screen Gems</a> joined Montgomery and Asher in making donations to the program as well. The students donated the money they received for writing the episode to a foundation to keep the program going. Two more trips were organized, bringing a total of fifty Jefferson High School students to the set of "Bewitched". Asher sent copies of thirty scripts of other "Bewitched" episodes to the school for use in classrooms. Saunders found the program a great success, saying "kids who could never write before were now writing three pages. Kids who could not read were now doubling up on scripts and fighting over who would be able to play the leads." Asher also expressed pleasure with the program's success, and recommended that other white businesspeople invite minority groups into their lives. Sargent considered Saunders the main reason for the success of the program, saying, "She was interested in innovative forms of teaching. These kids, who might have been stuck in the ghetto for the rest of their lives, loved "Bewitched", and with just a little approval and motivation, came alive on the set."

Asher produced and directed the episode. A high school student who was granted the role of <a href="assistant%20director">assistant director</a> at one point screamed "Quiet on the set!", a memory that Sargent later recalled fondly. For the scene in which Samantha casts a spell that makes Mr. Brockway see everyone as having black skin, the white actors, including Sargent and White, appeared in <a href="blackface">blackface</a>. The name of Mr. Brockway's toy company is never mentioned. Samantha's statement at the end of the episode, "We're having integrated turkey: white meat and dark", was repeated in <a href="Spike%20Lee">Spike Lee</a>'s 1986 film "<a href="She%27s%20Gotta%20Have%20It">She's Gotta Have It</a>". The final shot of the episode, which zooms out from the scene of Samantha and Darrin kissing to reveal the French doors at the back of their house as "<a href="Silent%20Night">Silent Night</a>" plays in the background, is the only shot in any episode of "Bewitched" to depict the interior of the house from the perspective of the backyard. "Sisters at Heart" is the only episode of the series in which Lisa appears. Seven years before acting together in "Sisters at Heart", Montgomery and Baer appeared together in an episode of the <a href="CBS">CBS</a> television series "<a href="Rawhide%20%28TV%20series%29">Rawhide</a>" called "Incident at El Crucero", which aired when <a href="I%2C%20Darrin%2C%20Take%20This%20Witch%2C%20Samantha">the pilot episode of "Bewitched"</a> was in <a href="pre-production">pre-production</a>. In 1970, Montgomery appeared on "<a href="The%20Merv%20Griffin%20Show">The Merv Griffin Show</a>" to promote "Sisters at Heart", thereby making one of the only three talk show appearances of her career. After Griffin left the network, CBS <a href="Wiping">wiped</a> all episodes of "The Merv Griffin Show" produced between 1969 and 1972, but a copy of the episode featuring Montgomery's promotion of "Sisters at Heart" was later discovered when it became known that relevant <a href="kinescope">kinescope</a>s and <a href="Audio%20mastering">master tapes</a> had survived.

Endorsed by meat production company <a href="Oscar%20Mayer">Oscar Mayer</a>, "Sisters at Heart" is a half-hour, <a href="Color%20television">color</a> episode that aired on December 24, 1970, as the 213th episode of "Bewitched" to be aired. As an introduction and conclusion to the episode, Montgomery briefly spoke to the camera about the episode, saying that it "was created in the true spirit of Christmas ... conceived in the image of innocence and filled with truth." ABC aired the episode only once more, in December 1971. Unlike many of the other episodes in the season, it was neither a remake of an episode from a previous season nor part of the <a href="Salem%2C%20Massachusetts">Salem, Massachusetts</a>, <a href="story%20arc">story arc</a> that was filmed in the area where the 17th-century <a href="Salem%20witch%20trials">Salem witch trials</a> took place. Don Marshall, who made a <a href="guest%20appearance">guest appearance</a> in "Sisters at Heart" as Keith Wilson, was known for his role in "<a href="Land%20of%20the%20Giants">Land of the Giants</a>", while Janee Michelle, who portrayed Dorothy Wilson in "Sisters at Heart", later became best known for her role in the 1974 <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a> "<a href="The%20House%20on%20Skull%20Mountain">The House on Skull Mountain</a>". "Sisters at Heart" was Montgomery's favorite episode of the series. Reflecting on the episode in 1989, she said, "Yeah, this is what I want "Bewitched" to be all about." <a href="Sony%20Pictures%20Home%20Entertainment">Sony Pictures Home Entertainment</a> eventually released the episode on a VHS collection called "A Bewitched Christmas 2". On June 16, 2005, the episode was screened in Salem as the first entry in "The Art and Politics of Elizabeth Montgomery", a film-watching and discussion group that met at <a href="First%20Church%20in%20Salem">First Church in Salem</a>.

"Sisters at Heart" received the Governors Award at the <a href="23rd%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">23rd Primetime Emmy Awards</a> ceremony in 1971. Montgomery's biographer Herbie Pilato wrote that the theme of overcoming prejudice is central to "Bewitched" because of the prominence of the marriage between a witch and a mortal, and that "no episode of the series more clearly represented this cry against prejudice than the holiday story, 'Sisters at Heart.'" A reviewer from the Australian newspaper the "<a href="Daily%20Liberal">Daily Liberal</a>" wrote that "Sisters at Heart" is "very thoughtful" and argued that it is the sole episode of the series that is not simply a "lightweight offering" reflective of "the United States' post-war society of new consumerism and advertising." When the seventh season of "Bewitched" was released on DVD in 2009, <a href="DVD%20Talk">DVD Talk</a> reviewer Paul Mavis wrote that "Sisters at Heart" has a more overt message than any other episode of the season. He praised the actors' performances in the episode and wrote that, because of the episode's obvious-yet-effective critique of racism, "what's highly ironic about "Sisters at Heart" today is that it would most likely be dubbed politically incorrect and 'insensitive' by some because the cast wear blackface at one point."

<a href="Hal%20Erickson%20%28author%29">Hal Erickson</a> of <a href="AllMovie">AllMovie</a> called the episode "refreshingly free of the patronization which usually attended 'racially sensitive' TV episodes of the period." In his book about "Bewitched", critic Walter Metz writes that "Sisters at Heart" exemplifies the liberalism endorsed by the series, which he argues is excessively sentimental and simplistic. He praises Asher for his "skillful understanding of film aesthetics", calling particular attention to Asher's choice of <a href="camera%20angle">camera angle</a>s in the scene in which Mr. Brockway first meets Lisa. Metz argues that the Stephens' <a href="foyer">foyer</a> is an important location in the series, and that this importance is exemplified in the episode both by the scene of Mr. Brockway's first encounter with Lisa as well as in the <a href="epilogue">epilogue</a> when Mr. Brockway revisits the house and apologizes for his prior racism. Metz criticizes Mr. Brockway's "magically found soft-heartedness" as a "paternalistic approach to liberal racial tolerance [that] implies that only white patriarchs have the cultural authority to declare that racism is wrong." Metz further argues that the episode problematically figures Samantha as the protector and provider for black people, a role that he says Samantha also fills in "Samantha at the Keyboard", another "Bewitched" episode.

Jacobus Anthonie Meessen

Jacobus Anthonie Meessen (; 5 December 1836 – 14 November 1885) was a Dutch photographer who took over 250 <a href="Portrait%20photography">portraits</a> and <a href="Landscape%20photography">landscapes</a> of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> (now Indonesia) between 1864 and 1870. Born to a carpenter in <a href="Utrecht">Utrecht</a>, Meessen worked in that trade in the Indies before marrying in the Netherlands in the early 1860s. He returned to the colony in 1864, intent on documenting its land and people. He worked mostly in the capital of Batavia (now <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>), <a href="Java">Java</a>, and <a href="Padang">Padang</a>, <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>; he also photographed <a href="Bangka%20Island">Bangka</a>, <a href="Belitung">Belitung</a>, <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>, and <a href="Nias">Nias</a>.

When Meessen returned to the Netherlands in 1870 he established a short-lived partnership with Abraham Vermeulen and began disseminating his photographs. Selected images were gifted to <a href="William%20III%20of%20the%20Netherlands">King William III</a> in an elaborately decorated album in 1871, while more were published by <a href="J.%20H.%20De%20Bussy">De Bussy</a> in 1875 and exhibited in Paris and Amsterdam. In his final years Meessen worked predominantly as an architect. Collections of his <a href="albumen%20print">albumen print</a>s, some of which were <a href="Hand-colouring%20of%20photographs">hand-tinted</a> or annotated, are held in four institutions in the Netherlands.

Meessen was born in <a href="Utrecht">Utrecht</a>, the Netherlands, on 5 December 1836 to the carpenter Hermanus Johannes Meessen and his wife Megteld Legué. In 1858 the younger Meessen first went to Batavia (now <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>), the capital of the Dutch colony in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">East Indies</a>, where he worked as a carpenter. By 1860 he was living in the <a href="Purbalingga%20Regency">Purbalingga</a> area. Two years later he returned to the Netherlands, where he served as a special inspector for the <a href="Rijkswaterstaat">Bureau voor den Waterstaat</a>. On 11 December 1862 he wed Johanna Alida (Jansje) Steenbeek in Utrecht, and the couple settled in that city for the next two years. Their marriage produced three daughters, born in 1865, 1866, and 1869; the first, Antonia, died in infancy.

Meessen and his wife departed for the Indies in 1864, first arriving in Batavia, where Meessen established a photo studio in early 1867. He was one of the few photographers active in the Indies in the 1860s; contemporaries included <a href="Isidore%20van%20Kinsbergen">Isidore van Kinsbergen</a>, Adolph Schaefer, and the commercial firm of Woodbury and Page (operated by <a href="Walter%20B.%20Woodbury">Walter B. Woodbury</a> and James Page). Meessen hoped to eventually take images of the Indies' various lands and people. From May to August he was in <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, first in <a href="Padang">Padang</a> and later in the <a href="Minangkabau%20Highlands">Minang Highlands</a>. There he offered various photographic services, including double and family portraits. When he returned to Batavia in September, he opened another studio, offering portraits and selling prints of landscapes.

Three months later Jacobus and Johanna sold their belongings and moved back to Padang, where the Meessens established a photography studio. In their biography of the photographer, Mattie Boom and Steven Wachlin suggest that this was likely a commercial necessity, as Meessen may have been unable to compete with the Batavia-based Woodbury and Page. By November 1868 Jacobus was advertising his first album, titled "Sumatra's Westkust" ("Sumatra's West Coast"). Bound in <a href="Moroccan%20leather">Moroccan leather</a>, the album contained more than sixty landscapes of Padang and surrounding cities (including <a href="Padang%20Panjang">Padang Panjang</a> and <a href="Bukittinggi">Fort de Kock</a>). By June 1869, his studio at the Sumatra Hotel was offering workshops, as well as images from northern Sumatra and <a href="Nias">Nias</a>.

Altogether, Meessen's photographic ventures in the Indies – and the resulting albums – cost some 34,000 <a href="Netherlands%20Indies%20gulden">Netherlands Indies gulden</a>, which included camera equipment (though it is not known what model(s) he used), chemicals, transportation, and accommodations. Meessen worked alone, never taking a partner while in the Indies, and documented the land and people in the colony in his <a href="albumen%20print">albumen print</a>s. In his <a href="ethnography">ethnographic</a> photography of the indigenous peoples of the Indies, he often had to overcome superstitions which, the "Bataviaasch Handelsblad" wrote, "made taking images of the people outside <a href="Java">Java</a> almost impossible". Others were more enthusiastic, including the villagers of Nias: "Upon arrival I fired a few shots and flew the Dutch flag. Soon the villagers came and asked what I wanted. Once I told them, they promised their assistance. At exactly 5 a.m. the following morning I found some 60 warriors waiting for me on the beach."

In June 1869, Meessen and his wife returned to Batavia, and the following year they returned to Utrecht. There, in late 1870, Meessen partnered with Abraham Adrianus Vermeulen to open a new studio, named A. A. Vermeulen & Company. They signed a contract for five years, but this collaboration collapsed in March 1873. Boom and Wachlin suggest that Vermeulen – best known for portraits – had been interested in the possibility of expanding his range with landscapes, whereas Meessen required a place to print and market his images of the Indies. Indeed, in February 1871 Meessen gifted an album of his better-executed photographs from his time in Java and Sumatra to <a href="William%20III%20of%20the%20Netherlands">King William III</a>. This album of 153 images was lavishly decorated with silver and gold, and featured the names of Java, Sumatra, <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>, and Nias in the corners. In the center were silver <a href="coconut%20tree">coconut</a> and <a href="banana%20tree">banana tree</a>s surrounding Dutch and Batavian weapons.

Over the next few years Meessen continued marketing his images of the Indies. In 1875, he published a collection of 250 – consisting of 175 landscapes and 75 portraits – through the <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>-based printer <a href="J.%20H.%20De%20Bussy">De Bussy</a>; this collection was titled "Verzameling Fotografien van Nederlandsch Indië" ("Collection of Photographs of the Dutch East Indies"), sold for 225 gulden, and came in a <a href="Juglans">walnut</a> box. At the 1875 Exposition Géographique in Paris, he exhibited these images to critical acclaim. The "Bataviaasch Handelsblad", in one review, wrote that the attempt to document the Indies was commendable, and expressed hope that images of animals could also be taken. In 1883 Meessen again exhibited his photographs, this time at the <a href="Internationale%20Koloniale%20en%20Uitvoerhandel%20Tentoonstelling">International Colonial and Export Trade Exhibition</a> in Amsterdam. Ultimately, however, he does not appear to have made a return on his investment.

Meessen's final years were migratory, with some time spent in <a href="Gorredijk">Gorredijk</a> and other parts of <a href="Opsterland">Opsterland</a>, <a href="Friesland">Friesland</a>. He worked as a building superintendent, and later municipal architect. One of his projects in this capacity was an elementary school on Zuidwest Dubbele Street in Gorredijk, a <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Neo-Gothic</a> building – possibly influenced by similar schools in <a href="Raamsdonkveer">Raamsdonkveer</a> and Amsterdam – constructed to replace an older school which had been demolished. Meessen died in Opsterland on 14 November 1885 after being stricken by an illness three days earlier. The incomplete school was finished by <a href="Hidde%20Petrus%20Nicolaas%20Halbertsma">Hidde Petrus Nicolaas Halbertsma</a>.

Reviewing the quality of Meessen's photography, Boom and Wachilin write that his Javanese pictures are among his best, whereas those from other islands are of more variable quality. They note considerable detail in his <a href="cityscape">cityscape</a>s. He chose buildings to photograph that were popular with other photographers, including the <a href="Merdeka%20Palace">Governor General's Palace</a> and the home of <a href="Raden%20Saleh">Raden Saleh</a>. Many of his studio portraits appear to be purely commercial, leading Boom and Wachlin to suggest that they were meant to fund Meessen's landscape photography. Some of his images, particularly the portraits, were <a href="Hand-colouring%20of%20photographs">hand-tinted</a>.

Meessen's photos from the album he gave to King William III are kept in <a href="the%20Hague">the Hague</a> at the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20the%20Netherlands">National Library of the Netherlands</a>. This album features a travelogue regarding Meessen's photography, as well as images from six islands (Java, Sumatra, <a href="Bangka%20Island">Bangka</a>, <a href="Belitung">Belitung</a>, Borneo, and Nias) and various ethnic groups, including the <a href="Javanese%20people">Javanese</a>, <a href="Chinese%20Indonesians">Chinese</a>, <a href="Dayak%20people">Dayaks</a>, and <a href="Ethnic%20Malays">Malays</a>. He includes commentary on several images of people, noting in an image of "<a href="njai">njai</a>" (concubines): "[They are] a necessary evil for the military. They preserve, in and outside the barracks, the best discipline, and prove invaluable in expeditions or sea journeys."

Two further photographs, one of the river <a href="Ciliwung">Ciliwung</a> in Batavia, and another of Kali Mati in Padang, are held at the <a href="Rijksmuseum">Rijksmuseum</a> in Amsterdam. The <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20Institute%20of%20Southeast%20Asian%20and%20Caribbean%20Studies">Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies</a> holds a copy of the De Bussy publication, and the <a href="Leiden%20University%20Library">Leiden University Library</a> holds 281 prints, 7 of which are of disputed provenance, which were donated to the <a href="Royal%20Dutch%20Geographical%20Society">Royal Dutch Geographical Society</a> by Pieter Johannes Veth in 1891. The four extant collections of Meessen's work are considerably fewer than those of his contemporaries such as Woodbury and Page, and his oeuvre has been little studied or collected.

English Benedictine Reform

The English Benedictine Reform or Monastic Reform of the <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Christianity">English church</a> in the late tenth century was a religious and intellectual movement in the later <a href="History%20of%20Anglo-Saxon%20England">Anglo-Saxon period</a>. In the mid-tenth century almost all monasteries were staffed by <a href="secular%20clergy">secular clergy</a>, who were often married. The reformers sought to replace them with celibate contemplative monks following the <a href="Rule%20of%20Saint%20Benedict">Rule of Saint Benedict</a>. The movement was inspired by European <a href="Cluniac%20Reforms">monastic reforms</a>, and the leading figures were <a href="Dunstan">Dunstan</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, <a href="%C3%86thelwold%20of%20Winchester">Æthelwold</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>, and <a href="Oswald%20of%20Worcester">Oswald</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>.

In seventh- and eighth-century England, most monasteries were Benedictine, but in the ninth century learning and monasticism declined severely. <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a> (871–899) deplored the decline and started to reverse it. The court of <a href="%C3%86thelstan">Æthelstan</a> (924–939), the first king of the whole of England, was cosmopolitan, and future reformers such as Dunstan and Æthelwold learned from Continental exponents of Benedictine monasticism. The English movement became dominant under King <a href="Edgar%20the%20Peaceful">Edgar</a> (959–975), who supported the expulsion of secular clergy from monasteries and cathedral chapters, and their replacement by monks. The reformers had close relations with the crown, furthering its interests and depending on its support. The movement was confined to the <a href="Southern%20England">south</a> and <a href="The%20Midlands">midlands</a>, as the crown was not strong enough in the <a href="Northern%20England">north</a> to confiscate property from local elites to establish Benedictine foundations in the area. The movement declined after the deaths of its leading exponents at the end of the tenth century.

The artistic workshops established by Æthelwold reached a high standard of craftsmanship in <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">manuscript illustration</a>, sculpture and gold and silver, and were influential both in England and on the Continent. In his monasteries, learning reached a high standard, producing competent prose and <a href="Old%20English%20literature%23Poetry">poetry</a> in the elaborate <a href="hermeneutic%20style">hermeneutic style</a> of Latin favoured in tenth-century England. His Winchester school played an important role in creating the standard vernacular <a href="West%20Saxon%20dialect">West Saxon</a> literary language, and his pupil <a href="%C3%86lfric%20of%20Eynsham">Ælfric</a> was its most eminent writer.

All surviving medieval accounts of the movement are by supporters of reform, who strongly condemned what they saw as the corruption and religious inadequacy of the secular clergy, but historians in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries have increasingly seen these accounts as unfairly biased against the secular clergy.

The author of the <a href="Rule%20of%20Saint%20Benedict">Rule of Saint Benedict</a>, which was the principal monastic code in Western Europe in the early Middle Ages, was Saint <a href="Benedict%20of%20Nursia">Benedict of Nursia</a> (c. 480–550). Under this rule the lives of the monks were mainly devoted to prayer, together with reading sacred texts and manual work. They lived a communal life and were required to give complete obedience to their abbot. Benedict's achievement was to produce a stable system characterised by moderation and prudence.

The seventh century saw the development of a powerful monastic movement in England, which was strongly influenced by the ideas of St Benedict, and the late seventh-century English scholar <a href="Aldhelm">Aldhelm</a> assumed that monasteries would normally follow the Benedictine rule. However, by 800, few foundations could claim high spiritual and intellectual standards, and the ninth century saw a sharp decline in learning and monasticism. Political and financial pressures, partly due to disruption caused by <a href="History%20of%20England%23Viking%20challenge%20and%20the%20rise%20of%20Wessex">Viking attacks</a>, led to an increasing preference for pastoral clergy over contemplative monks. There was a progressive transfer of property from the <a href="Minster%20%28church%29">minster</a>s to the crown, which accelerated after 850. According to <a href="John%20Blair%20%28historian%29">John Blair</a>:

At the end of the ninth century <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a> started to revive learning and monasticism, and this work was carried on by his grandson, King <a href="%C3%86thelstan">Æthelstan</a> (924–939). Kings before <a href="Edgar%20the%20Peaceful">Edgar</a> (959–975) did not take the view, which was adopted by Æthelwold and his circle, that the only worthwhile religious life was Benedictine monasticism. When <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20of%20Brogne">Gérard of Brogne</a> reformed the <a href="Abbey%20of%20Saint%20Bertin">Abbey of Saint Bertin</a> in <a href="Saint-Omer">Saint-Omer</a> in 944, dissident monks found a refuge in England under King <a href="Edmund%20I">Edmund</a> (939–946). Before the tenth-century reform, the lines between secular clergy and monastics were sometimes blurred. There are cases of communities of monks established to provide pastoral care, and clergy in some secular establishments lived according to monastic rules.

The Benedictine reform movement on the continent started with the foundation of <a href="Cluny%20Abbey">Cluny Abbey</a> in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Burgundy">Burgundy</a> in 909-10, but the influence of Cluny, which was innovative in its customs, was largely confined to Burgundy. England's closest links were with the more conservative <a href="Fleury%20Abbey">Fleury Abbey</a> on the <a href="Loire">Loire</a>, which had great prestige because it held Saint Benedict's body. The leaders of the English movement were also influenced by the reforms which had been promulgated by the <a href="Carolingian">Carolingian</a> <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> <a href="Louis%20the%20Pious">Louis the Pious</a> at the <a href="Synods%20of%20Aachen%20%28816%E2%80%93819%29">Synods of Aachen</a> in the 810s, and particularly their promulgation of uniform monastic rules under the authority of the crown. Modest religious and diplomatic contacts between England and the Continent under Alfred and his son <a href="Edward%20the%20Elder">Edward the Elder</a> (899–924) intensified during the reign of Æthelstan, which saw the start of the monastic revival. Four of Æthelstan's half-sisters married European rulers, resulting in closer contacts between the English and Continental courts than ever before. Many manuscripts were imported, influencing English art and scholarship, and English churchmen learnt about the Continental Benedictine reform movement.

The leaders of the English Benedictine reform were <a href="Dunstan">Dunstan</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> (959–988), <a href="%C3%86thelwold%20of%20Winchester">Æthelwold</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a> (963–984), and <a href="Oswald%20of%20Worcester">Oswald</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a> (971–992). Dunstan and Æthelwold reached maturity in Æthelstan's cosmopolitan, intellectual court in the 930s, where they met monks from the European reformed houses which provided the inspiration for the English movement. In the early 940s Dunstan was appointed Abbot of <a href="Glastonbury%20Abbey">Glastonbury</a>, where he was joined by Æthelwold, and they spent much of the next decade studying Benedictine texts at Glastonbury, which became the first centre for disseminating monastic reform. The Rule of Saint Benedict was translated into <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> at this time, probably by Æthelwold, and it is the only surviving prose translation of the Rule into a European vernacular in the early Middle Ages. In about 954 Æthelwold wished to go to the Continent to study reforms there at first hand, but King <a href="Eadred">Eadred</a> (946–955) refused him permission and appointed him Abbot of <a href="Abingdon%20Abbey">Abingdon</a>, which became the second centre. Dunstan was exiled by King <a href="Eadwig">Eadwig</a> (955–959) between 956 and 958, and he spent this time observing Benedictine practices at <a href="St.%20Peter%27s%20Abbey%2C%20Ghent">St Peter's Abbey</a> in <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a>. Æthelwold on the other hand appears to have been on good terms with Eadwig, an early indication that the reformers were not united politically. Oswald was a nephew of <a href="Oda%20of%20Canterbury">Oda</a>, Archbishop of Canterbury from 941 to 958. Oda, a supporter of reform, introduced Oswald to Fleury, where he was ordained and spent a large part of the 950s.

<a href="Rosamond%20McKitterick">Rosamond McKitterick</a> observes that "the zeal for monastic reform undoubtedly was a common bond right across Europe". On the other hand, relations between monasteries and their patrons varied. Where rulers were weak, as in Burgundy, Cluny looked to the papacy for protection, whereas in other areas such as <a href="County%20of%20Flanders">Flanders</a>, monasteries had close links with local rulers. In England there was a close dependence on the royal family and very little papal influence. The accession in 959 of Edgar, the first king to strongly support reform, led to court support for the imposition of Benedictine rules on a number of old minsters with monks imported from houses such as Oswald's <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Church%2C%20Westbury%20on%20Trym">Westbury on Trym</a>, Dunstan's Glastonbury and Æthelwold's Abingdon. Hardly any of the reformed houses were new foundations, but a few nunneries, which had royal connections, were established in <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a> and <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>.

In 963, Edgar appointed Æthelwold as Bishop of Winchester, and with the support of the king and the pope the new bishop promptly expelled the secular clergy from the city's <a href="Old%20Minster%2C%20Winchester">Old</a> and <a href="New%20Minster%2C%20Winchester">New Minsters</a>, and replaced them with monks. The secular clerks and their supporters were local people of consequence, and the king had to resort to force to confiscate their wealthy <a href="benefice">benefice</a>s. By 975 around 30 male houses and 7 or 8 nunneries had been reformed, all in Wessex or places in the Midlands where Æthelwold and Oswald held property. However, the reformed houses were then probably only around 10 per cent of the religious establishments. The wealthiest reformed monasteries were far richer than ordinary secular minsters, and the late-eleventh century <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a> shows that some possessed almost as much land as the greatest lay magnates, but rich and important unreformed houses such as <a href="St%20Mary%20and%20St%20Cuthbert%2C%20Chester-le-Street">Chester-le-Street</a> and <a href="Bury%20St%20Edmunds%20Abbey">Bury St Edmunds</a> flourished into the eleventh century. The reformers' propaganda, mainly from Æthelwold's circle, claimed that the church was transformed in Edgar's reign, but in Blair's view the religious culture "when we probe beneath the surface, starts to look less exclusive and more like that of Æthelstan's and Edmund's".

Edgar was concerned about different interpretations of the Benedictine Rule in different monasteries in his kingdom, and wanted to impose uniform rules to be followed by all. The rules were set out in the key document of the English reform, the "<a href="Regularis%20Concordia%20%28Winchester%29">Regularis Concordia</a>", which was adopted by the Council of Winchester in around 970. The "Concordia" was written by Æthelwold, who had sought advice from Ghent and Fleury Abbeys. A major aim of the "Concordia" was the regularisation of the form of church services, and Æthelwold tried to synthesise what he regarded as the best Continental and English practice.

On the Continent there were different interpretations of the Benedictine Rule, but in England uniform practice was a matter of political principle. The "Concordia" said that King Edgar "urged all to be of one mind as regards monastic usage ... and so, with their minds anchored firmly on the ordinances of the Rule, to avoid all dissension, lest differing ways of observing the customs of one Rule and one country should bring their holy conversation into disrepute." Fleury's customs were the most important influence on the "Regularis Concordia", and Fleury itself appears to have been influenced by English liturgical practices.
The conquest of the <a href="Danelaw">Danelaw</a> by West Saxon kings had united England in a single kingdom for the first time, enabling kings from Æthelstan onwards to see themselves as heirs of the Carolingian emperors; the regulation of monasteries by a uniform Benedictine rule was designed to unite the kingdom ideologically and enhance royal prestige. The monks depended on the king in a way that the local <a href="ealdormen">ealdormen</a> did not, so their loyalty could be trusted and they could act as a counterbalance to powerful local families. The "Regularis Concordia" required that psalms be said for the king and the queen in monasteries several times a day, and specified that royal consent must be obtained for the election of abbots. The reformers aimed to enhance the Christian character of kingship, and one aspect of this was to raise the status of the queen; Edgar's last wife, <a href="%C3%86lfthryth%2C%20wife%20of%20Edgar">Ælfthryth</a>, was the first king's consort to regularly witness charters as "regina".

The reformers' propaganda claimed that England had been unified as a result of the wide acceptance of Benedictinism, and that the movement's greatest benefactor, King Edgar, had played a major role in the unification by his demands for adherence to the Benedictine Rule. Æthelwold probably tutored Edgar as a boy, and was very close to him; it is likely that Æthelwold was influential in persuading the king to carry through his reforms and support Benedictine monasticism. Monks became dominant on the bishops' bench during his reign.

Æthelwold was close to Queen Ælfthryth and supported the claim of her son <a href="%C3%86thelred%20the%20Unready">Æthelred</a> (978–1016) to be king against his elder half-brother, <a href="Edward%20the%20Martyr">Edward</a> (975–978). Dunstan supported Edward, who succeeded on Edgar's death in 975. Æthelred became king on his half-brother's murder in 978, Æthelwold becoming a powerful figure at court until his death in 984.

Nobles made donations to reformed foundations for religious reasons, and many believed that they could save their souls by patronising holy men who would pray for them, and thus help to expiate their sins. In some cases gifts were a payment for the right to be buried at a monastery. Some aristocrats founded new monasteries; for example, <a href="%C3%86thelwine%2C%20Ealdorman%20of%20East%20Anglia">Æthelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia</a>, founded <a href="Ramsey%20Abbey">Ramsey Abbey</a> in 969, gave it many gifts, and <a href="translation%20%28relic%29">translated</a> the <a href="relic">relic</a>s of two martyred princes to it. Gifts were designed to increase the prestige of both the donor and recipient, as when Ealdorman <a href="Byrhtnoth">Byrhtnoth</a> of Essex, later to be the hero of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Maldon">Battle of Maldon</a>, gave <a href="Ely%20Abbey">Ely Abbey</a> "thirty <a href="mancus">mancus</a>es of gold, twenty pounds of silver, two gold crosses, two lace palls containing precious works of gold and gems, and two finely made gloves". Upon his death his widow added a large hanging worked with images of his victories, apparently previously hanging at their house, and a gold <a href="torc">torc</a>. The 12th-century local chronicle, the "<a href="Liber%20Eliensis">Liber Eliensis</a>", records 14 churches which also received gifts from him.

Nobles' choice of recipient was determined by their relationship with individual monks and other aristocrats. An individual would patronise the same foundations that other family members and allies supported, but despoil the property of houses associated with his political adversaries. Æthelwine of East Anglia and <a href="%C3%86lfhere%2C%20Ealdorman%20of%20Mercia">Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia</a> were the leaders of the two rival factions. Ælfhere seized land of Æthelwine's Ramsey and was an enemy of Archbishop Oswald and an ally of Bishop Æthelwold. Æthelwine, a friend of Oswald, sometimes seized land belonging to Æthelwold's Ely. Oswald himself used his position to assist his relatives, leasing Worcester lands to them in ways which had been forbidden by ninth-century synods. The historian Janet Pope comments: "It appears that religion, even monasticism, could not break the tight kin group as the basic social structure in tenth-century England."

The three leaders of the movement were all aristocrats, and they were able to get the support of their family and friends as well as the King. In Pope's view "this close link between the monks and the nobles is ultimately the most important factor in the success of the reform". Wormald agrees, stating that aristocratic support for monastic reform was more important for its success than royal or papal sponsorship. The aristocracy did not confine their support to reformed foundations, but continued to donate to unreformed ones.

<a href="Nicholas%20Brooks">Nicholas Brooks</a> describes Dunstan as "the ablest and best loved figure that tenth-century England produced", and observes that his "example helped to inspire a massive transfer of landed resources from the secular aristocracy to the religious aristocracy; it made possible a revival of scholarly, religious, pastoral and cultural standards in late tenth-century England that gave a distinctively monastic character to the English church and hierarchy". But Brooks admits that it is very difficult to point to any specific contribution that he made to the reform, and Robertson questions Dunstan's importance: "At the present time it would be unwise to give a definitive answer to the question whether Dunstan's role as the instigator of a monastic reform movement was a tenth-century fact or a twelfth-century fiction."

Æthelwold reformed monasteries in his own diocese of Winchester, and he also helped to restore houses in eastern England, such as <a href="Medeshamstede">Peterborough</a>, <a href="Ely%20Cathedral">Ely</a>, <a href="Thorney%20Abbey">Thorney</a> and <a href="St%20Neots%20Priory">St Neots</a>. Almost all had been monasteries in the seventh century, and had later become communities of secular clerks or transferred to secular ownership, so he could argue that he was just restoring their original status. He also restored nunneries, working with his ally, Queen Ælfthryth. He did not merely attempt to revive the historical church, but also to improve it by inventing dubious pedigrees for his houses. He was the main propagandist for the movement, and wrote all the major works supporting it in England during Edgar's reign.

Blair describes the basic aim of the movement, both in England and on the Continent, as being "to establish and disseminate high liturgical, spiritual and pastoral standards". On the Continent, cathedral chapters were staffed by secular <a href="Canons%20Regular">canons</a>, and only monasteries had monks. Æthelwold rejected this distinction; his expulsion of clerics in favour of monks from Winchester Cathedral (the Old Minster) as well as the New Minster introduced a unique feature to the English reform. Dunstan and Oswald hesitated to follow his example, probably because unlike Æthelwold they had lived abroad and understood continental practice, and also because they preferred a gradualist approach to Æthelwold's confrontational strategy. Oswald installed monks at <a href="Worcester%20Cathedral">Worcester Cathedral</a>, but he built a new church for them and retained the clerics, who were educated with the monks in the same classroom. Canterbury did not become fully monastic until after Dunstan's death. Æthelwold was a historian who was reviving what he believed to be the practice of the past, particularly <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20the%20Great">Pope Gregory the Great</a>'s injunction to <a href="Augustine%20of%20Canterbury">Augustine</a> in the "<a href="Libellus%20Responsionum">Libellus Responsionum</a>", as reported by <a href="Bede">Bede</a>, that Augustine should continue as a bishop to live the life of a monk. Blair argues that large religious institutions could not function without priests carrying out parochial duties, and he comments that "Æthelwold's rejection of all forms of religious life but the monastic was decidedly odd. The lurid stigmatizations of clerics as foul, lazy, and lascivious come mainly from his circle." Although the Rule of Saint Benedict barred monks from engaging in external ministry, English Benedictines were actively engaged in pastoral work and teaching the secular clergy.

Dunstan's first biographer, called "B", was a secular cleric who left Glastonbury for <a href="Li%C3%A8ge">Liège</a> in around 960. After 980 he made several attempts to gain the patronage of leading English churchmen, but they were unsuccessful because monastic reformers were unwilling to assist a secular canon living abroad. The secular priests lacked able scholars to defend themselves, and no defence against Æthelwold's charges has survived. The leading twelfth-century historians, <a href="John%20of%20Worcester">John of Worcester</a> and <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a>, were Benedictines who reinforced the seculars' negative image. The diverse minsters and religious practices of Anglo-Saxon England were disguised by a small group which obtained a near monopoly of the religious record and presented an unreal picture of religious uniformity.

Reformers attached great importance to the elevation and translation of saints, moving their bodies from their initial resting place to a higher and more prominent location to make them more accessible for <a href="veneration">veneration</a>. An important precursor was the seventh-century translation of the remains of St Benedict himself from <a href="Monte%20Cassino">Monte Cassino</a> to Fleury Abbey. By the tenth century, translation usually involved a grand procession, an elaborate new shrine and often reconstruction of the church. Almost nothing is known of the life of <a href="Swithun">Swithun</a>, who was an obscure ninth-century Bishop of Winchester until Æthelwold launched a major cult of him as a saint, and translated his grave from outside the Old Minster to a new shrine inside. After Æthelwold's own death in 984 his progress to becoming the subject of a cult followed the conventional path: his grave is said to have been neglected until he appeared in a vision to say that his body should be moved, and his successor <a href="%C3%86lfheah%20of%20Canterbury">Ælfheah</a> then built a new choir to hold his body, where it became the focus of miracles.

Saints were believed to have an active power after death, and the reformers made great efforts to transfer saints' remains and relics from obscure minsters to their own new establishments. Characteristically, Æthelwold showed great energy in this. Gifts of land and other possessions to a church were often expressed as donations to its principal saint, so the seizure of such a saint's remains from an unreformed community could then justify the transfer of its wealth to a Benedictine monastery, on the ground that as property had been donated to the saint, it should follow his or her body to its new home. The reformers had what Alan Thacker calls a "mania for saint-making and relic collecting". Theft of relics from unreformed communities to increase a church's collection was common, such as Ely Abbey's "relic raid" on <a href="Dereham">Dereham</a> in 974 to obtain the remains of Saint <a href="Wihtburh">Wihtburg</a>. This was probably associated with the acquisition by Ely of Dereham church, and may have been a means of ensuring that the abbey kept possession of the church's estates. According to Thacker, Æthelwold's activities were "on an unrivalled scale":

On the other hand, although Oswald was active in promoting cults, he does not generally seem to have used relic collecting as a means of gaining control of the assets of secular communities, and Dunstan displayed no interest in relics.

After the death of King Edgar in 975, aristocrats who had lost land and family religious houses to the reformed monasteries took advantage of the disputed succession between Edgar's sons to seize back their property. Ælfhere of Mercia took the lead in the "anti-monastic reaction", against defenders of the reformed houses such as Æthelwine of East Anglia, and Byrhtnoth, later to be the hero of "<a href="The%20Battle%20of%20Maldon">The Battle of Maldon</a>". According to <a href="Byrhtferth">Byrhtferth</a> of Ramsey Abbey, "monks were smitten with fear, the people trembled; and clerics were filled with joy, for their time had come. Abbots were expelled with their monks, clerics were installed with their wives, and the error was worse than before."

<a href="Ann%20Williams%20%28historian%29">Ann Williams</a> argues that a long-standing rivalry between Ælfhere and Æthelwine was an important factor in the disturbances which followed Edgar's death. She comments:

The "anti-monastic reaction" was short-lived, but the reformed monasteries went into a long term decline, and they were hard hit by the renewal of Viking attacks and high taxation from the 980s. Blair comments: "For all their great and continuing achievements, the reformed houses after the 970s lived more on inherited capital than on dynamic growth." No spiritual leaders of the church emerged in the eleventh century comparable with the three main figures of the monastic reform, and the position of monks in English religious and political life declined. There were very few important new foundations, the main exception being Bury St Edmunds, where a Benedictine community replaced a clerical one early in the century. There were also a few more monasteries founded by lay nobility, the last being <a href="St.%20Mary%27s%20Priory%20and%20Cathedral">Coventry Abbey</a> in 1045, founded by <a href="Leofric%2C%20Earl%20of%20Mercia">Leofric, Earl of Mercia</a> and his wife <a href="Lady%20Godiva">Godgifu</a>. Monks lost their near monopoly on bishoprics, partly because <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>, who spent his early life abroad, preferred foreign clerics in his episcopal appointments, but mainly because the development of royal government required a permanent staff, and this was supplied by secular royal priests, who would be rewarded by nomination to bishoprics. The influence of the centralising "Regularis Concordia" declined following the deaths of the founders of the movement, and there was increasing localism in the eleventh century, with few links between monasteries.

The enthusiasm for relics continued, and foundations' prestige was greatly increased by success in obtaining the remains of important saints. The period between the Benedictine Reform and the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest</a> saw the most lavish donations of land to monasteries of any period in medieval England, and the leading reformed foundations became immensely wealthy, retaining their status after the Conquest. Monasteries founded in the Anglo-Saxon period enjoyed greater prosperity and prestige than post-Conquest establishments.

<a href="Simon%20Keynes">Simon Keynes</a> describes the Benedictine reform as "the particular aspect of [Edgar's] reign which has come to dominate all others". Keynes says:

<a href="Antonia%20Gransden">Antonia Gransden</a> sees some continuity of the Anglo-Saxon monastic tradition from its origin in seventh-century Northumbria, and argues that historians have exaggerated both the importance of the tenth-century reform and its debt to continental models. The Anglo-Saxons shared the general medieval tendency to revere the past, and monks in the later Anglo-Saxon period saw the age of Bede as laying the foundations of their own observance and organisation. Nicola Robertson says that: "the evidence for the existence of a unified reform movement is, in my opinion, very fragile".

Martin Ryan is also sceptical, pointing out that there is very little evidence of reforming activity in northern England, even though Oswald was Archbishop of York. This may reflect the reformers' dependence on royal support; they needed Edgar's backing to expel secular clergy, and his power was too tenuous in the north to allow this. The most northerly Benedictine abbey was <a href="Burton%20Abbey">Burton upon Trent</a>. Ryan comments:
<a href="Julia%20Barrow">Julia Barrow</a> agrees, arguing that the establishment of the Benedictine monasteries was "not necessarily the most important development within the English church of the time"; far more significant numerically was the growth in parish churches.

In the view of Catherine Cubitt the reform "has rightly been regarded as one of the most significant episodes in Anglo-Saxon history", which "transformed English religious life, regenerated artistic and intellectual activities and forged a new relationship between church and king". The prosperity of later Anglo-Saxon England was important to its success, and it was underpinned by trade and diplomacy with continental Europe as well as by religious needs. She acknowledges the reform's limited geographical impact:

<a href="Helmut%20Gneuss">Helmut Gneuss</a> observes that although the reformed monasteries were confined to the south and midlands, "here a new golden age of monastic life in England dawned and brought in its train a renaissance of culture, literature and art". In the view of Mechthild Gretsch: "No school in Anglo-Saxon England has been praised more warmly by its pupils than the school established by Æthelwold at the Old Minster". He established high standards of learning, with skilled exponents of the elaborate and obscure <a href="hermeneutic%20style">hermeneutic style</a> of Latin which was the house style of the Benedictine Reform. He sent monks to Fleury and <a href="Corbie%20Abbey">Corbie</a> Abbeys to learn about liturgical chant, and surviving Winchester <a href="Trope%20%28music%29%23Medieval%20music">tropers</a> (books of liturgical music) include music by Continental and English composers, many written in hermeneutic Latin.

Visual art combined new influences from continental monastic styles with development of earlier English features, and is often described as the "Winchester style" or "school" although this was only one of the centres involved. Although the foundation of new communities reduced in the early eleventh century, art continued to flourish as the existing monasteries grew richer. The <a href="Benedictional%20of%20St.%20%C3%86thelwold">Benedictional of St. Æthelwold</a> (Winchester, probably 970s, now <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>) is recognised as the most important of a group of surviving <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a>s, lavishly illustrated with extravagant <a href="acanthus%20leaf">acanthus leaf</a> borders. According to the dedicatory poem, Æthelwold "commanded ... many frames well adorned and filled with various figures decorated with numerous beautiful colours and with gold", and he got what he asked for. It is described by Andrew Prescott as the "outstanding work of art to have survived from this period". According to <a href="Barbara%20Yorke">Barbara Yorke</a>, "The artistic workshops established at Æthelwold's foundations during his lifetime were to continue as influential schools of craftsmen after his death, and had a widespread influence both in England and on the Continent."

As well as lavish illumination, the period saw the development of a distinct English tradition of line drawing in manuscripts, sometimes with the addition of light colour in ink or wash (<a href="watercolour">watercolour</a>), often to reinforce ink in highlighting outlines. This is often divided into two rather different sub-styles. These also developed from continental styles – one of which, sometimes referred to as the "Utrecht style", was influenced strongly by the presence in Canterbury from around 1000 of the <a href="Carolingian%20art">Carolingian</a> <a href="Utrecht%20Psalter">Utrecht Psalter</a>, where each psalm is illustrated with a panoramic ink drawing full of tiny figures. The <a href="Harley%20Psalter">Harley Psalter</a> from Canterbury (probably 1020s) is a copy, with differences in style such as the addition of coloured washes. Dunstan was himself an artist, as were many monks who rose to senior positions, and the earliest datable outline drawing is probably by him, and includes a portrait of him prostrating himself before Christ. This was added to a blank page in an older book, probably before his exile in 956. The other "Winchester" style of drawing can be characterised by detailed and agitated drapery, an effect sometimes taken to excess, but giving animation to figures. The skilled use of line drawing continued to be a feature of English art for centuries, for example in the <a href="Eadwine%20Psalter">Eadwine Psalter</a> (Canterbury, probably 1150s) and the work of <a href="Matthew%20Paris">Matthew Paris</a>, monk of St Albans (c. 1200 – 1259) and his followers.

The very few remains of monastic architecture in the period are supplemented by brief documentary mentions. <a href="St%20Laurence%27s%20Church%2C%20Bradford-on-Avon">St Laurence's Church, Bradford-on-Avon</a> appears to represent a unique near-complete monastic church of the period, and the angels in relief were probably part of a large <a href="rood%20cross">rood cross</a> group. Generally the contemporary sources give much more detail on the valuable treasures in precious metal, rich embroidered cloth, and other materials which the monasteries were able to accumulate, largely from gifts by the elite. The few pieces to survive mostly did so outside England, and include the silver <a href="Brussels%20Cross">Brussels Cross</a> and a <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20reliquary%20cross">walrus ivory figure from a Crucifixion</a>.

Susan Irvine describes five historical watersheds in the development of the <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> language, the fourth of which is the Benedictine Reform, which "led indirectly to the establishment of an Old English 'literary language'". In the late ninth century King Alfred had carried through a programme of translating Latin texts into the vernacular, and almost a century later the monastic reformers revived the project of producing texts in English for teaching. Æthelwold's school at Winchester aimed to establish a standard West Saxon literary language, a programme probably initiated by Æthelwold himself. His most illustrious pupil, <a href="%C3%86lfric%20of%20Eynsham">Ælfric</a> (c.950–c.1010), who became abbot of <a href="Eynsham%20Abbey">Eynsham</a>, aimed to write in accordance with a consistent grammatical system and vocabulary.

Ælfric, who was described by Claudio Leonardi as "the highest pinnacle of Benedictine reform and Anglo-Saxon literature", shared in the movement's monastic ideals and devotion to learning, as well as its close relations with leading lay people. His works included two series of forty homilies, <a href="hagiography">lives of saints</a>, a Latin grammar in English, and a discussion of trades and occupations. He was an adviser of the king, and an authority on church practice and canon law. <a href="Matthew%20Parker">Matthew Parker</a>, Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20I">Elizabeth I</a>'s first <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, cited him in support of Protestant doctrines, and his discussion of <a href="Eucharistic%20theology">Eucharistic theory</a> was cited in theological controversies until the nineteenth century.

The reformers were mainly interested in prose rather than poetry, but the bulk of <a href="Old%20English%20poetry">Old English poetry</a> survives in manuscripts of the late tenth and early eleventh centuries, of which the most important are the <a href="Beowulf%20manuscript">Beowulf manuscript</a>, <a href="Exeter%20Book">Exeter Book</a>, <a href="Vercelli%20Book">Vercelli Book</a>, and the <a href="Junius%20manuscript">Junius manuscript</a>. Although the dates of composition of most of this poetry remain uncertain, much of it is probably considerably older than the manuscripts. This is probably because of the interest in vernacular works fostered by the Benedictines. Most surviving vernacular literature was produced by followers of the Benedictine reformers, and written in the standard Old English they championed. Walter Hofstetter observes:

The Continental leaders of the church immediately after 1066 justified the Conquest by denigrating the pre-Conquest state of the Anglo-Saxon church. Newcomers such as <a href="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</a>, who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1070, had no interest in saints venerated by the Anglo-Saxons, and his "Constitutiones" for Christ Church, Canterbury, show no debt to the "Regularis Concordia". However, Anglo-Norman monks soon turned the Anglo-Saxon hagiographical tradition to their own uses, and saints venerated by the Anglo-Saxons regained respect. Monasteries' land and privileges were defended by appealing to pre-Conquest charters, and fabricating fraudulent ones if necessary. In the next generation two historians of mixed parentage, <a href="Eadmer">Eadmer</a> and William of Malmesbury, saw a pattern of an early Northumbrian peak followed by decline until a revival in the tenth century, and a further decline which reached its nadir on the eve of the Conquest. This scheme, which saw both the tenth century and the post-Conquest as peaks of monastic excellence preceded by periods of decline, satisfied both Norman propaganda and Anglo-Saxon pride, but in Gransden's view it unfairly denigrates the achievements of the periods of so-called decline.

Before the twenty-first century, the Benedictine reform dominated history textbooks of the period, and the earlier tenth century and later eleventh received far less attention. According to Wormald: "For English historians, the tenth century is above all one of "Reformation", the enforcement of Benedictine observance upon the religious life". The main sources for the reform are the lives of Dunstan, Oswald and Æthelwold, and this creates the risk of exaggerating the role of these three men at the expense of the many lesser-known men who contributed to the process, and on concentrating on reformed communities at the expense of less rigorous and secular ones. The picture drawn of the reform by Æthelwold and his circle has been dominant, and historians have generally portrayed it favourably. In 2005 John Blair commented: "Ecclesiastical historians' distaste for the lifestyle of secular ministers, which has become less explicit but can even now seem virtually instinctive, reflects contemporary partisanship absorbed into a historiographical tradition which has privileged the centre over the localities, and the ideals of the reformers over the realities and needs of grass-roots religious life." In the twenty-first century, historians have been far more sceptical of the reformers' claims, and defended the contribution of the clerics and local churches.

Modern historians see clerical institutions in the mid-tenth century, such as Winchester and Canterbury, as flourishing centres of activity in religion, literature and the arts. In Keynes's view: "there had been a steady development throughout the first half of the tenth century, so that when the reform movement gathered momentum, from about 960 onwards, the reformers were able to draw on the traditions and resources of an already flourishing church." The historian Marco Mostert comments: "one has the impression that the life of letters flourished in the unreformed monasteries in ways not dissimilar to that in the Benedictines' monasteries. The monastic reform movement took pride in much that was already in existence."

Royal Naval Division War Memorial

The Royal Naval Division Memorial is a <a href="World%20War%20I%20memorials">First World War memorial</a> located on <a href="Horse%20Guards%20Parade">Horse Guards Parade</a> in central <a href="London">London</a>, and dedicated to members of the <a href="63rd%20%28Royal%20Naval%29%20Division">63rd (Royal Naval) Division</a> (RND) killed in that conflict. <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a> designed the memorial, which was unveiled on 25April 1925—ten years to the day after the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli landings</a>, in which the division suffered heavy casualties. Shortly after the war, former members of the division established a committee, chaired by one of their leading officers, Brigadier-General <a href="Arthur%20Asquith">Arthur Asquith</a>, to raise funds for a memorial. Progress was initially slow. The committee planned to incorporate its memorial into a larger monument proposed by the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> for <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a>. When the navy abandoned that project, the RND's committee decided to proceed independently. They engaged Lutyens, who, after negotiation with the <a href="Office%20of%20Works">Office of Works</a>, produced a design for a fountain connected to the <a href="balustrade">balustrade</a> of the <a href="Admiralty%23Admiralty_Extension">Admiralty Extension building</a>.

Lutyens' <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a> rises from a bowl, with water spouts projecting from sculpted lion heads at its base. The bowl is connected to a second, shallower basin by a decorative <a href="plinth">plinth</a>. The base contains <a href="relief">relief</a> carvings of the insignia of units attached to the RND. As well as various dedicatory inscriptions, the base contains the division's battle honours and an excerpt from the poem "<a href="The%20Dead%20%28poem%29">III: The Dead</a>" by <a href="Rupert%20Brooke">Rupert Brooke</a>, who died of disease while serving in the division in 1915. The memorial was unveiled on 25April 1925 by Major-General <a href="Archibald%20Paris%20%28Royal%20Marines%20officer%29">Sir Archibald Paris</a>, the division's first commanding officer. <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, the division's creator, gave a rousing speech praising Lutyens' design and the RND's record of distinguished service.

The memorial was dismantled and placed in storage in 1939 to allow the construction of the <a href="Admiralty%20Citadel">Admiralty Citadel</a> in the Second World War. It was re-erected in 1951, in the grounds of the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20College%2C%20Greenwich">Royal Naval College</a> in <a href="Greenwich">Greenwich</a>. When the college closed in the late 1990s, a campaign was established to move the memorial back to its original location, where it was unveiled in 2003; <a href="Winston%20Churchill%20%281940%E2%80%932010%29">Churchill's grandson</a> read out his grandfather's speech from the original ceremony. The memorial was designated a gradeII <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> in 2008 and upgraded to gradeII* in 2015, when <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> declared Lutyens' war memorials a national collection.

In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>, described by <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> as "the leading English architect of his generation". Lutyens established his reputation designing <a href="country%20house">country house</a>s for wealthy clients, but the war had a profound effect on him; following it, he devoted much of his time to memorialising its casualties. He became renowned for his commemorative works through his design for <a href="the%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">the Cenotaph</a> on <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a>, which became Britain's national war memorial. This, along with his work for the <a href="Imperial%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Imperial War Graves Commission</a>, led to commissions for war memorials across Britain and the empire. As well as memorials for towns and cities, Lutyens was commissioned to design memorials for several private companies and military units. These were among the least controversial of Lutyens' war memorials as sites and funds tended to be readily available.

The <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Division">Royal Naval Division</a> (RND) was a land-based formation under the command of the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a>. It was created by <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, the <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> (the government minister responsible for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>), in 1914 by grouping together sailors, <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a>, and naval and marine reservists who were surplus to the Admiralty's sea-faring needs. The division was required to provide almost all of its own officers upon formation, several of whom were drawn from the literary and artistic contacts of Churchill's private secretary, <a href="Edward%20Marsh%20%28polymath%29">Edward Marsh</a>. Although it fought on land, the division was known for its strong maritime traditions, including the use of naval ranks and terminology. The division's first engagements of the war were in Belgium at the end of 1914, attempting to defend the port cities of <a href="Ostend">Ostend</a> and <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>. The following year, the RND, alongside the <a href="29th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">29th Division</a>, formed the British contingent of the initial invasion force for the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a>—an ultimately doomed invasion of Turkey which the Allies hoped would knock the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> out of the war. After suffering heavy casualties at Gallipoli, the division was evacuated in 1916, reorganised, and transferred to the command of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>, where it became the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division. As part of the reorganisation, the division's commanding officer, Major-General <a href="Archibald%20Paris%20%28Royal%20Marines%20officer%29">Archibald Paris</a> (a Royal Marine), was replaced with an army officer, Major-General <a href="Cameron%20Shute">Cameron Shute</a>, and several army units were attached to compensate for the division's losses at Gallipoli, though it retained its maritime character. It was sent to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> as an infantry division in late 1916, where it remained until the armistice in 1918. The division was disbanded in June 1919 at a ceremony on <a href="Horse%20Guards%20Parade">Horse Guards Parade</a>. It lost 10,737 officers and men during the war; another 30,892 were wounded.

Immediately after the war, former members of the division formed a committee to explore possibilities for a memorial. The committee was chaired by one of the leading members of the RND, Brigadier-General <a href="Arthur%20Asquith">Arthur Asquith</a>, the son of <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">H. H. Asquith</a>, the British prime minister for the first half of the war. At this point, the Admiralty was considering plans for a large memorial to the Royal Navy in London's <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a>, but opted for three monuments across the south coast of England (the <a href="Plymouth%20Naval%20Memorial">Plymouth</a>, <a href="Portsmouth%20Naval%20Memorial">Portsmouth</a>, and <a href="Chatham%20Naval%20Memorial">Chatham</a> naval memorials). The RND committee was keen to have its memorial in London, and proceeded independently. The committee still hoped to have its memorial in Trafalgar Square, but the <a href="Office%20of%20Works">Office of Works</a> considered that their budget of £3,000 would not produce a work suitable for such a prominent location. <a href="Reginald%20Blomfield">Sir Reginald Blomfield</a>—a government adviser on war memorials and a prominent designer of memorials in his own right—suggested a site on the <a href="Victoria%20Embankment">Victoria Embankment</a> alongside the River Thames, which became home to multiple war memorials, but the committee rejected the idea. The office's permanent secretary, <a href="Lionel%20Earle">Sir Lionel Earle</a>, suggested that Asquith consult <a href="Charles%20Sargeant%20Jagger">Charles Sargeant Jagger</a> with regards to the design of the memorial, though nothing appears to have resulted from the discussion.

Progress came when Asquith approached Lutyens—an introduction possibly made by <a href="Bernard%20Freyberg%2C%201st%20Baron%20Freyberg">Bernard Freyberg</a>, another leading member of the division, whose wife commissioned Lutyens to design <a href="Spalding%20War%20Memorial">Spalding War Memorial</a>. Lutyens began a discussion with the Office of Works about potential sites. In correspondence with Lutyens, Earle suggested a fountain at the rear of the <a href="Admiralty%23Admiralty%20Extension">Admiralty Extension building</a>, though this faced <a href="St%20James%27s%20Park">St James's Park</a>, and Earle was conscious that the building of war memorials in the royal parks had previously been controversial. Thus, he told Lutyens that the monument would have to be "a purely sylvan piece of architecture" and not obviously a war memorial. To this, Asquith's committee agreed, and Lutyens sent Earle rough drawings for a fountain in May 1924, which Earle forwarded to Sir Vincent Baddeley, the First Principal Assistant Secretary to the Admiralty. Baddeley gave provisional approval for a site on the <a href="balustrade">balustrade</a> at the south-west corner of the Admiralty Extension on 18 July; three days later <a href="King%20George%20V">King George V</a> gave final approval for both the design and the site.

The memorial is carved from <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a> and consists of an obelisk rising from a circular bowl, supported by a moulded square base which connects to a second, shallower bowl and then to a large square <a href="plinth">plinth</a>. The plinth extends from the balustrade of the former Admiralty Extension building on Horse Guards Parade, a military parade ground off Whitehall, the centre of the British government. To the rear and left of the memorial is the <a href="Military%20citadels%20under%20London%23Admiralty%20Citadel">Admiralty Citadel</a>, a bomb-proof command centre built during the Second World War. Relief carvings of the Royal Naval Division's insignia are located on each of the four sides of the obelisk's base. Immediately below the reliefs are sculpted lion heads, the mouths of which contain water spouts, allowing water to spill into the basin. The obelisk rises to off the ground, while the widest part of the plinth is across.

At the top of the plinth, on the south and west sides (front and left, respectively, when viewed from the parade ground), are reliefs of 18 <a href="cap%20badge">cap badge</a>s of units which formed part of the division. A moulded <a href="cornice">cornice</a> separates the top of the plinth from the lower sections. Below this, the central section is divided horizontally into three panels, the central panel projecting slightly forward. On the south side of the memorial, a cross is etched into the central panel, flanked by the start and end dates of the First World War— on the left and on the right. Below is the main dedication, . The side panels contain battle honours: on the left and on the right. On the west side, the side panels read (left) and (right); the central panel contains a verse from the 1914 poem "<a href="The%20Dead%20%28poem%29">III: The Dead</a>" by <a href="Rupert%20Brooke">Rupert Brooke</a>, a war poet and member of the RND who died of disease while en route with the division to Gallipoli in April 1915: 

The lower section of the plinth is mostly undecorated. The front face contains two more cap badges and on the west face are inscriptions of the names of two battalions from the division: and . Where the plinth joins the balustrade of the Admiralty building, an inscription on a stone panel records the history of the memorial: . The original cap badge carvings were the work of <a href="Eric%20Broadbent">Eric Broadbent</a>, a former army officer and previous collaborator of Lutyens', while the two on the bottom section of the front face were added in 1931 by <a href="Frederick%20J.%20Wilcoxson">Frederick J. Wilcoxson</a>—recommended by Lutyens to the Office of Works—another former army officer who later worked on several other war memorials. Further additions were made in 1938 by F.G. Relph of the Kingston Masonry Works, who was also recommended by Lutyens. The RND Memorial is one of several of Lutyens' memorials to include an obelisk. Among others is his <a href="Lancashire%20Fusiliers%20War%20Memorial">memorial to the Lancashire Fusiliers</a>, who also fought at Gallipoli, though he used the design of an obelisk in a fountain in only one other memorial, the <a href="Irish%20National%20War%20Memorial%20Gardens">Irish National War Memorial Gardens</a> in Dublin.

The memorial was unveiled by Major-General Sir Archibald Paris, the first commander of the division, on 25April 1925—the tenth anniversary of the Gallipoli landings. In his address, Paris described the memorial as "a permanent record of noble deeds and duty accomplished". It was dedicated by the Reverend Bevill Close, one of the division's chaplains, who was joined by a Catholic chaplain, Father Eric Green. Rupert Brooke's mother attended, along with multiple senior military officers including Asquith, Freyburg, General <a href="Ian%20Hamilton%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Sir Ian Hamilton</a> (commander of the Gallipoli campaign), Vice-Admiral <a href="Roger%20Keyes%2C%201st%20Baron%20Keyes">Sir Roger Keyes</a> (who was involved in the naval element of the Gallipoli campaign), and Captain <a href="Oliver%20Backhouse">Oliver Backhouse</a> (a brigade commander in the RND). Winston Churchill gave a rousing speech in which he referred to the division's distinguished record and its heavy losses at Gallipoli. He told the crowd that "Everyone, I think, must admire the grace and simplicity of this fountain which the genius of Lutyens has designed. The site is also well chosen. Here, under the shadow of the Admiralty Building, eleven years ago, the Royal Naval Division was called into martial service; this monument now records their fame and preserves their memory. Their memory is thus linked forever with the Royal Navy, whose child they were, of whose traditions they were so proud." He described the "high calm peace" of Rupert Brooke's poetry, inscribed on the memorial, rising "confidently above the tumult and carnage, and above all error and confusion" and concluded that "this fountain will give forth not only the waters of honour, but the waters of healing and the waters of hope". The service concluded with the national anthem, <a href="God%20Save%20the%20King">God Save the King</a>. 

The initial cost of the memorial was met entirely by private subscriptions, largely from former members of the division or the families of those killed while serving in it. By far the largest contributor was <a href="Harold%20Harmsworth%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Rothermere">Lord Rothermere</a>—owner of the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" newspaper—whose second son, Vere Harmsworth, was killed in action with the division at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Ancre">Battle of the Ancre</a> in 1916. <a href="HM%20Treasury">HM Treasury</a> authorised the Office of Works to see to the ongoing maintenance of the fountain, to which the RND Association contributed through a trust fund established with surplus donations, chaired by Arthur Asquith and now in the hands of the <a href="Commandant%20General%20Royal%20Marines">Commandant General Royal Marines</a>. The fund also covered the construction of <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20I%20memorials%20and%20cemeteries%20in%20the%20Somme%23Beaucourt%20Naval%20Division%20Memorial">a memorial</a> to the RND near <a href="Beaucourt-sur-l%27Ancre">Beaucourt-sur-l'Ancre</a> in France, which takes the form of a truncated stone obelisk. 

Within a year of the unveiling of the fountain, problems were discovered with the structure; the bowl was not perfectly horizontal, meaning that water cascaded over only one side, spoiling the effect, while the ground beneath became waterlogged. The RND Association paid for repairs, including paving the ground next to the memorial. By 1928 it was apparent that the association's ongoing contribution was insufficient; the Office of Works eventually, though grudgingly, agreed to cover the cost of any further repairs as well as routine maintenance. 

The memorial remained in situ until 1939, when work began on the Admiralty Citadel and the memorial was dismantled and put into storage to avoid damage during the Second World War. It was held first in the yard of the stone masonry firm <a href="Holloway%20Brothers%20%28London%29">Holloway Brothers</a> in <a href="Nine%20Elms">Nine Elms</a> (along with several other central London monuments moved for safekeeping) and later in the grounds of the <a href="Royal%20Hospital%20Chelsea">Royal Hospital Chelsea</a>. Following the end of the second war in 1945, the RND Association lobbied heavily for the prompt re-erection of its memorial. The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Works%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Works</a> (successor to the Office of Works) decided that the fountain could not be reinstalled in its original location and began exploring alternative sites. After considering and rejecting multiple sites, and following further pressure from the RND Association, the ministry agreed in 1949 to reassemble the memorial in the grounds of the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20College%2C%20Greenwich">Royal Naval College</a> in <a href="Greenwich">Greenwich</a>, south-east London. It was finally re-erected outside the Queen Anne Building, where it was unveiled by the <a href="Second%20Sea%20Lord">Second Sea Lord</a>, Vice Admiral <a href="Alexander%20Madden">Alexander Madden</a> (standing in for the <a href="First%20Sea%20Lord">First Sea Lord</a>, Admiral <a href="Bruce%20Fraser%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fraser%20of%20North%20Cape">Lord Fraser</a>) on 26May 1951.

The former members of the division had mixed feelings about the location. It lacked the prominence and visibility of a central London location, but in another it provided a convenient focal point for gatherings of former members, which took place regularly until 1981. When the closure of the college was proposed in the late 1990s, Captain Christopher Page—a retired Royal Navy and military historian with a particular interest in the Royal Naval Division—instigated a campaign to have the memorial restored to its original location on Horse Guards Parade. A fund was established to cover the cost of the move, and all funds and permissions were in place in early 2003. After restoration work by the stonemason David Ball, it was re-installed there on 13November 2003, the anniversary of the division's attack at Beaucourt-sur-l'Ancre during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Battle of the Somme</a> in 1916. <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Charles</a> performed the unveiling in the presence of <a href="Prince%20Michael%20of%20Kent">Prince Michael of Kent</a> (honorary commodore of the <a href="Royal%20Navy%20Volunteer%20Reserve">Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve</a>), Admiral <a href="Alan%20West%2C%20Baron%20West%20of%20Spithead">Sir Alan West</a> (First Sea Lord), and the Reverend <a href="Barry%20Hammett">Barry Hammett</a> (<a href="Chaplain%20of%20the%20Fleet">Chaplain of the Fleet</a>). <a href="Winston%20Churchill%20%281940%E2%80%932010%29">Churchill's grandson</a> (also called Winston Churchill) read out the speech his grandfather gave at the original ceremony in 1925.

The memorial was designated a grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> in 2008. Listed status provides legal protection from demolition or modification; gradeII is applied to buildings of "special interest, warranting every effort to preserve them". It was upgraded to gradeII* (reserved for "particularly important buildings of more than special interest" and applied to about 5.5% of listings) in November 2015, when Historic England deemed Lutyens' war memorials a national collection as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War.

Hugh Beadle

Sir Thomas Hugh William Beadle (6 February 1905 – 14 December 1980) was a <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a>n lawyer, politician and judge who served as his country's <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20Rhodesia">Chief Justice</a> from 1961 to 1977. He came to international prominence against the backdrop of Rhodesia's <a href="Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Unilateral Declaration of Independence</a> (UDI) from Britain in 1965, upon which he initially stood by the British <a href="Governor%20of%20Southern%20Rhodesia">Governor</a> <a href="Humphrey%20Gibbs">Sir Humphrey Gibbs</a> as an adviser; he then provoked acrimony in British government circles by declaring <a href="Ian%20Smith">Ian Smith</a>'s post-UDI administration legal in 1968.

Born and raised in the Rhodesian capital <a href="Harare">Salisbury</a>, Beadle read law in South Africa and England before commencing practice in <a href="Bulawayo">Bulawayo</a> in 1931. He became a member of the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20Legislative%20Assembly">Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly</a> for <a href="Godfrey%20Huggins">Godfrey Huggins</a>'s ruling <a href="United%20Federal%20Party">United Party</a> in 1939. Appointed Huggins's <a href="Parliamentary%20Private%20Secretary">Parliamentary Private Secretary</a> in 1940, he retained that role until 1946, when he became Minister of Internal Affairs and Justice; the Education and Health portfolios were added two years later. He retired from politics in 1950 to become a judge of the Southern Rhodesian High Court. In 1961, he was knighted and appointed Chief Justice; three years later he became president of the High Court's new Appellate Division and a member of the British <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Council</a>.

Beadle held the <a href="Rhodesian%20Front">Rhodesian Front</a>, the governing party from 1962, in low regard, dismissing its Justice Minister <a href="Desmond%20Lardner-Burke">Desmond Lardner-Burke</a> as a "small time country solicitor". As independence talks between Britain and Rhodesia gravitated towards stalemate, Beadle repeatedly attempted to arrange a compromise. He continued these efforts after UDI, and brought <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> and Smith together for talks aboard <a href="HMS%20Tiger%20%28C20%29">HMS "Tiger"</a>. The summit failed; Wilson afterwards castigated Beadle for not persuading Smith to settle.

Beadle's "de jure" recognition of the post-UDI government in 1968 outraged the Wilson administration and drew accusations from the British Prime Minister and others that he had furtively supported UDI all along. His true motives remain the subject of speculation. After Smith declared a republic in 1970, Beadle continued as Chief Justice; he was almost removed from the Privy Council, but kept his place following Wilson's <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201970">electoral defeat</a> soon after. Beadle retired in 1977 and thereafter sat as an acting judge in special trials for terrorist offences. He died in <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a> on 14 December 1980, aged 75.

Thomas Hugh William Beadle (generally known as Hugh) was born in <a href="Harare">Salisbury</a>, <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a> on 6 February 1905, the only son and eldest child of Arthur William Beadle and his wife Christiana Maria ("née" Fischer). He had two sisters. The family was politically conservative and favoured joining the <a href="Union%20of%20South%20Africa">Union of South Africa</a> during the latter years of <a href="Company%20rule%20in%20Rhodesia">Company rule</a>, sharing a firm consensus that <a href="Charles%20Coghlan%20%28politician%29">Sir Charles Coghlan</a> and his <a href="responsible%20government">responsible government</a> movement were, in Beadle's recollection, "a pretty wild bunch of <a href="jingoism">jingoes</a>". Responsible government ultimately prevailed in the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20government%20referendum%2C%201922">1922 referendum</a> of the mostly white electorate, and Southern Rhodesia became a <a href="self-governing%20colony">self-governing colony</a> the following year.

After attending Salisbury Boys' School, <a href="Milton%20High%20School%20%28Zimbabwe%29">Milton High School</a> in <a href="Bulawayo">Bulawayo</a> and <a href="Diocesan%20College">Diocesan College</a>, <a href="Rondebosch">Rondebosch</a>, Beadle studied law at the <a href="University%20of%20Cape%20Town">University of Cape Town</a>. He completed his <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Laws">Bachelor of Laws</a> degree in 1928, then continued his studies in England as a <a href="Rhodes%20Scholarship">Rhodes Scholar</a> at <a href="The%20Queen%27s%20College%2C%20Oxford">The Queen's College, Oxford</a>. There he played rugby and tennis for the college, boxed for the university and qualified as a pilot with the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Air%20Squadron">Oxford University Air Squadron</a>. He graduated with a second-class <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Civil%20Law">Bachelor of Civil Law</a> degree in 1930, and soon after was called to the English <a href="Bar%20%28law%29">bar</a>. He briefly <a href="reading%20law">read</a> in London chambers before commencing practice in Bulawayo in 1931. In 1934 he married Leonie Barry, a farmer's daughter from <a href="Barrydale">Barrydale</a> in the <a href="Cape%20Province">Cape of Good Hope</a>; they had two daughters.

After returning to Rhodesia, Beadle took an interest in politics; he joined the <a href="United%20Federal%20Party">United Party</a>, created from the former <a href="Rhodesia%20Party">Rhodesia Party</a> and the conservative faction of the Reform Party to contest the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201934">1934 general election</a>. He was attracted to the United Party not so much by its policies but by his admiration for its leading figures—he considered the Prime Minister <a href="Godfrey%20Huggins">Godfrey Huggins</a> "a man of the calibre I think of <a href="Cecil%20Rhodes">Rhodes</a>". The Southern Rhodesian electoral system allowed only those who met certain financial and educational qualifications to vote. The criteria were applied equally to all regardless of race, but since most black citizens did not meet the set standards, the electoral roll and the colonial <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20Legislative%20Assembly">Legislative Assembly</a> were overwhelmingly from the <a href="white%20people%20in%20Zimbabwe">white minority</a> (about 5% of the population). The United Party broadly represented commercial interests, civil servants and the professional classes.

Beadle stood in Bulawayo South in the 1934 election, challenging <a href="Harry%20Davies%20%28politician%29">Harry Davies</a>, the <a href="Rhodesia%20Labour%20Party">Labour</a> leader. Davies defeated Beadle by 458 votes to 430, but the United Party won decisively elsewhere and formed a new government with 24 out of the 30 parliament seats. Huggins, who remained prime minister, held Beadle in high regard and made him a close associate. In the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201939">1939 election</a>, Beadle won a three-way contest in Bulawayo North with 461 votes out of 869, and became a United Party MP. Beadle was seconded to the <a href="Gold%20Coast%20Regiment">Gold Coast Regiment</a> with the rank of temporary captain following the outbreak of the Second World War, but was released from military service at the request of the Southern Rhodesian government to serve as Huggins's <a href="Parliamentary%20Private%20Secretary">Parliamentary Private Secretary</a>, "with access to all ministers and top-ranking officials on the PM's business to speed up affairs". He held this post from 1940 to 1946, during which time he was also Deputy <a href="Advocate%20General">Advocate General</a> for the Southern Rhodesian armed forces.

In the first post-war election in <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201946">1946</a>, Beadle defeated Labour's Cecil Maurice Baker in Bulawayo North by 666 votes to 196. He was appointed Minister of Internal Affairs and Justice. The same year he was made a <a href="Queen%27s%20Counsel">King’s Counsel</a> and appointed <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">OBE</a>. Two years later, after retaining his seat in the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201948">1948 election</a> with a large majority, he was assigned two more portfolios, those of Education and Health. Around this time he turned down an approach from a group of <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia%20Liberal%20Party">Liberal</a> and rebel United Party MPs to challenge Huggins's premiership. Beadle had entered the Cabinet at a time when relations between the United Party and the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">British Labour Party</a> were warming. He formed a good relationship with <a href="Aneurin%20Bevan">Aneurin Bevan</a>, the UK <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Health">Minister of Health</a>, and put considerable work into attempting to create a Southern Rhodesian system similar to <a href="National%20Insurance">National Insurance</a> in Britain. These efforts were largely unsuccessful, but did lead to a maternity grant for white mothers, nicknamed the "Beadle baby scheme". Beadle retired from politics in 1950 to accept a seat on the Southern Rhodesian High Court. This decision surprised many of his contemporaries; Beadle would explain later that he left politics as he did not feel he would work well under his United Party colleague <a href="Edgar%20Whitehead">Edgar Whitehead</a>, whose subsequent rise to the premiership he correctly predicted.

Beadle filled the seat on the High Court bench vacated by <a href="Robert%20Clarkson%20Tredgold">Sir Robert Tredgold</a>, who had just been appointed <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20Rhodesia">Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia</a>. Despite his close relationship with Huggins, Beadle had strong misgivings regarding <a href="Federation%20of%20Rhodesia%20and%20Nyasaland">Federation</a> with <a href="Northern%20Rhodesia">Northern Rhodesia</a> and <a href="Nyasaland">Nyasaland</a>, which became Huggins's flagship project. Beadle argued that since the British government would never devolve indigenous African affairs to Federal responsibility, native policy in the three territories would never be co-ordinated, meaning "the thing was bound to crash". Nevertheless, Huggins sent him to London in 1949 to discuss the legal problems of the proposed Federation with the British government. Beadle later expressed regrets that he had not played a bigger role in drawing up the constitution for the Federation, which was inaugurated as an indissoluble entity in 1953, following a mostly white <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20federation%20referendum%2C%201953">referendum</a> in Southern Rhodesia. Huggins spent three years as Federal Prime Minister before retiring in 1956. Whitehead became Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia in 1958.

After Leonie's death in 1953, Beadle married Olive Jackson, of Salisbury, in 1954. He later said that he was repeatedly asked to resign from the bench to become the Federal Minister of Law or stand for Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, but "didn't regard any of the issues as crucial enough to warrant my going back". Beadle's biographer <a href="Claire%20Palley">Claire Palley</a> describes him as "a learned, fair but also adventurous judge". He was appointed <a href="Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">CMG</a> in 1957. In August 1959, amid rising <a href="African%20nationalism">black nationalism</a> and opposition to the Federation, particularly in the two northern territories, Beadle chaired a three-man tribunal on the Southern Rhodesian government's <a href="preventive%20detention">preventive detention</a> of black nationalist leaders without trial during the disturbances. He upheld the government's actions, reporting that the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia%20African%20National%20Congress">Southern Rhodesia African National Congress</a> had disseminated "subversive propaganda", encouraged racial hatred, intimidated people into joining and undermined the authority of tribal chiefs, government officials and police.

In 1960 Beadle was a member of the <a href="Monckton%20Commission">Monckton Commission</a> on the Federation's future. According to <a href="Aidan%20Crawley">Aidan Crawley</a>, a British member of the commission, Beadle began the process "as a radical advocate of white supremacy" but later expressed markedly different views. The commissioners "hardly agreed on anything", in Beadle's recollection. While not recommending dissolution, the Monckton report was strongly critical of the Federation. It advocated a wide range of reforms, rejected any further advance towards Federal independence until these were implemented, and called for the territories to be permitted to secede if opposition continued. Beadle was knighted in 1961 and the same year appointed Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia. A primary school in Bulawayo was named after him. In "Mehta v. City of Salisbury" (1961), a case challenging the racial segregation of a public swimming pool, Beadle decided that <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a> made precedents in South African case law invalid, ruled that the plaintiff's dignity had been <a href="Crimen%20injuria">unlawfully affronted</a>, and awarded him damages. Following continued black nationalist opposition to the Federation, particularly in Nyasaland, the British government announced in 1962 that Nyasaland would be allowed to secede. This was soon extended to Northern Rhodesia as well, and at the end of 1963 the Federation was dismantled.

Whitehead's United Federal Party was defeated in the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201962">1962 Southern Rhodesian general election</a> by the <a href="Rhodesian%20Front">Rhodesian Front</a> (RF), an all-white, firmly conservative party led by <a href="Winston%20Field">Winston Field</a> whose declared goal was independence for Southern Rhodesia without major constitutional changes and without commitment to any set timetable regarding black majority rule. RF proponents downplayed black nationalist grievances regarding land ownership and segregation, and argued that despite the racial imbalance in domestic politics—whites made up 5% of the population, but over 90% of registered voters—the electoral system was not racist as the franchise was based on financial and educational qualifications rather than ethnicity. Beadle expressed an extremely low opinion of the RF. <a href="Ian%20Smith">Ian Smith</a>, who replaced Field as prime minister in 1964, was in Beadle's eyes an unconvincing leader; <a href="Desmond%20Lardner-Burke">Desmond Lardner-Burke</a>, the Justice Minister, was a "fascist" and a "small time country solicitor ... incapable of producing correct documents for an undefended divorce action". The same year Smith took over, Beadle became a member of the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Council</a> in London and president of the new Appellate Division of the Southern Rhodesian High Court. In this latter role he blocked a Legislative Assembly act to extend periods of preventive restriction outside times of emergency, ruling it against the declaration of rights contained in Southern Rhodesia's 1961 constitution.

Britain granted independence to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, renamed Zambia and Malawi respectively, under black majority governments in 1964. As independence talks between the British and Southern Rhodesian governments continued with little progress, speculation began to mount that the colonial government might attempt a <a href="unilateral%20declaration%20of%20independence">unilateral declaration of independence</a> (UDI) if no accommodation could be found. The British High Commissioner in Salisbury, <a href="John%20Baines%20Johnston">J B Johnston</a>, had few doubts about how Beadle would respond to such an act, writing that he was "quite certain that no personal considerations would deflect him for a moment from administering the law with absolute integrity." <a href="Arthur%20Bottomley">Arthur Bottomley</a>, the British <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Commonwealth%20Relations">Сommonwealth Secretary</a>, took a similar line, describing Beadle to the Prime Minister <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> as "a staunch constitutionalist" who would be disposed to "frustrate any illegal action by Mr Smith's government".

Beadle told Wilson that he and the judiciary would stand by the law in the event of a UDI, but that he expected the armed forces and police to side with the post-UDI authorities. He thought UDI would be a political and economic mistake for Rhodesia, and attempted to dissuade Smith from this course of action, but at the same time asserted that if UDI occurred it was "not the function of a court to attempt to end the revolution and restore legality". He warned his High Court colleagues that he would not direct "a judicial rebellion against the Rhodesian government".
Smith and Wilson made little progress towards a settlement during 1964 and 1965; each accused the other of being unreasonable. The RF won a decisive victory in the <a href="Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201965">May 1965 general election</a>. After efforts to forge a compromise in London in early October 1965 failed, Wilson, desperate to avert UDI, travelled to Salisbury later that month to continue negotiations. Beadle's "irrepressible ingenuity led to an incredible succession of proposals for a settlement", Wilson recalled, but these talks also failed. The two sides agreed on an investigatory Royal Commission, possibly chaired by Beadle, to recommend a path towards independence, but could not settle on the terms. Beadle continued to seek a compromise, and on 8 November persuaded Smith to allow him to go to London to meet Wilson again. Beadle told Wilson that he thought Smith was personally disposed to continue talks but under pressure from some of his ministers to abandon negotiations. Wilson told the British <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> that Beadle had provided "wise advice" to both governments, and was "welcome [in] this country not only for his sagacity, judgement, and humanity but as a man with the courage of a lion."

Beadle later wrote to his fellow High Court judge Benjamin Goldin that he thought he had "saved the situation" by going to London, having persuaded Wilson to give some ground on the terms for the Royal Commission, but his trip alarmed the pro-UDI camp in the Rhodesian Cabinet, who feared that Beadle might be carrying a message to the Governor <a href="Humphrey%20Gibbs">Sir Humphrey Gibbs</a> telling him to <a href="%3Awiktionary%3Aprorogue">prorogue</a> parliament. Smith and his Cabinet <a href="Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">declared independence</a> on 11 November 1965, while Beadle was at <a href="Kenneth%20Kaunda%20International%20Airport">Lusaka Airport</a> on his way home. Smith later rejected the suggestion that Beadle could have had anything significant to tell them on his return, saying that "the only thing that Beadle could have done when he got back was to have talked us out of insisting on our questions".

Before announcing UDI to the nation, Smith, Lardner-Burke and the Deputy Prime Minister <a href="Clifford%20Dupont">Clifford Dupont</a> visited Gibbs at Government House to inform him personally and ask him to resign. Gibbs made clear that he would not do so, but indicated that he would vacate Government House and return to his farm. When Beadle arrived later in the day, he not only persuaded Gibbs to stay at the official residence, but moved in himself to provide advice and moral support. On Beadle's counsel, Gibbs instructed those responsible for law and order in Rhodesia to stay at their posts and carry on as normal. When the Governor showed no sign of stepping down, Smith's government effectively replaced him with Dupont, appointing the latter to the post of <a href="Officer%20Administering%20the%20Government">Officer Administering the Government</a> created by the 1965 constitution attached to UDI. Lardner-Burke asked Beadle to administer the oath of allegiance to Dupont, but was rebuffed; Beadle said he would be committing a criminal offence if he did so.

The UK government introduced extensive economic and political sanctions against Rhodesia and indicated that any dialogue had to take place through Gibbs. Beadle was told to liaise with Lardner-Burke regarding any proposals Smith's government might have. Beadle would later recount that the post-UDI government briefly threatened him, telling him to "go now, otherwise you lose your job", but he was ultimately left alone. The Chief Justice noted in his diary that Smith's government was "not prepared to force [a] showdown with the judges".

During the immediate post-UDI period Beadle, in his role as Chief Justice, occupied a unique position as he could speak directly with all the main players—Gibbs, Smith and Wilson. He became the main intermediary between them, and received a <a href="dormant%20commission">dormant commission</a> from the UK government to replace Gibbs as governor in case of necessity. He visited London in January 1966 and, according to Wilson's <a href="Attorney%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Attorney General</a> <a href="Frederick%20Elwyn%20Jones%2C%20Baron%20Elwyn-Jones">Elwyn Jones</a>, was "scornful of the 1965 constitution". Some in Rhodesia criticised Beadle for going to London, or accused him of siding with Gibbs against Smith. The Chief Justice insisted that he was just trying to do his best for Rhodesia, a claim Smith accepted, saying Beadle "thought more of his country than of his position". The UK <a href="Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office">Foreign Office</a> remained wary, speculating in a January 1966 report that while the British government hoped to reclaim Rhodesia "in such a way that policy and thinking is reoriented, racial attitudes changed, and the path to majority rule firmly laid," the Chief Justice "would be content to see a 1961-type constitution, without independence, remain for a long time".

Beadle summarised the Rhodesian judiciary's position in light of UDI by saying simply that the judges would carry on with their duties "according to the law", but this non-committal stance was challenged by legal cases heard at the High Court. The first of these was "<a href="Madzimbamuto%20v.%20Lardner-Burke">Madzimbamuto v. Lardner-Burke N. O. and Others</a>", concerning Daniel Madzimbamuto, a black nationalist detained without trial five days before UDI under emergency powers. When Lardner-Burke's ministry prolonged the state of emergency in February 1966, Madzimbamuto's wife appealed for his release, arguing that since the UK government had declared UDI illegal and outlawed the Rhodesian government, the state of emergency (and, by extension, her husband's imprisonment) had no legal basis. The High Court's General Division ruled on 9 September 1966 that the UK retained legal sovereignty, but that to "avoid chaos and a vacuum in the law" the Rhodesian government should be considered to be in control of law and order to the same extent as before UDI. Madzimbamuto appealed to Beadle's Appellate Division, which considered the case over the next year and a half.

Beadle arranged "talks about talks" between the British and Rhodesian governments during 1966, which led to Smith and Wilson meeting personally aboard <a href="HMS%20Tiger%20%28C20%29">HMS "Tiger"</a> off Gibraltar between 2 and 4 December. Beadle had to be hoisted aboard because of a back injury. Negotiations snagged primarily over the matter of the transition. Wilson insisted on the abandonment of the 1965 constitution, the dissolution of the post-UDI government and a period under a British Governor—conditions that Smith saw as tantamount to surrender, particularly as the British proposed to draft and introduce the new constitution only after a fresh test of opinion under UK control. Indeed, Smith had warned Beadle before the summit that unless he "could assure his people that a reasonable constitution had been agreed", he would feel unable to settle. Smith said he could not agree without first consulting his ministers in Salisbury, infuriating Wilson, who declared that a central condition of the talks had been that he and Smith would have <a href="plenipotentiary">plenipotentiary</a> powers to make a deal.

Beadle agreed with Smith that a deal ending UDI without any prior agreement on the replacement constitution would meet with widespread opposition among white Rhodesians, but still felt that Salisbury should agree. He asked Smith to commend the terms to his colleagues in Salisbury, speculating that if he did the Cabinet would surely accept. Smith refused to make such a commitment, much to the disappointment of Beadle and Gibbs, and signed the final document only to acknowledge it as an accurate record. Wilson was furious with Beadle, feeling that he should have taken a far firmer line to persuade Smith to settle; after Beadle left the meeting, Wilson said that he "could not understand how any man could have a slipped disc whom Providence had failed to provide with a backbone". Beadle and Gibbs urged Smith to reconsider during the journey home, but made little headway.

During the Rhodesian Cabinet meeting on the proposals, the judges were kept informed by the "expression on Sir Hugh's face and from comments of increasing despair", Goldin later wrote; the Chief Justice "spent the whole day in his chambers looking more anxious and despondent after each occasion on which he was smuggled into the Cabinet meeting to explain the meaning or effect of particular provisions". On 5 December 1966, when Beadle heard at Government House that Smith's ministers had rejected the terms, he stood "as though pole-axed", Gibbs's <a href="Private%20Secretary">Private Secretary</a> <a href="John%20Pestell">Sir John Pestell</a> recalled, and appeared close to collapse. The judge's wife and daughter helped him to slowly return to his room.

The United Nations instituted mandatory economic sanctions against Rhodesia in December 1966. Over the next year British diplomatic activity regarding Rhodesia was diminished; the UK government's stated policy shifted towards NIBMAR—"<a href="no%20independence%20before%20majority%20rule">no independence before majority rule</a>". Beadle grappled with the Rhodesian problem privately and in correspondence, attempting to reconcile the Smith administration's control over the country with the unconstitutional nature of UDI. <a href="Erwin%20Griswold">Erwin Griswold</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Solicitor%20General">United States Solicitor General</a>, wrote to him that as he saw it the Rhodesian judges could not recognise the post-UDI government as "de facto" while also claiming to act under the Queen's commission.

Ruling on Madzimbamuto's appeal in January 1968, Beadle and three other judges decided that Smith's post-UDI order was not "de jure" but should be acknowledged as the "de facto" government by virtue of its "effective control over the state's territory". Sir Robert Tredgold, the former Southern Rhodesian and Federal Chief Justice, told Gibbs that Beadle had thereby "sold the pass" and "should be asked to leave Government House". The following month, considering the fate of James Dhlamini, Victor Mlambo and Duly Shadreck, three black Rhodesians sentenced to death before UDI for murder and terrorist offences, Beadle upheld Salisbury's power to execute the men. Whitehall reacted by announcing on 1 March 1968 that at the request of the UK government, the Queen had exercised the <a href="royal%20prerogative%20of%20mercy">royal prerogative of mercy</a> and commuted the sentences to life imprisonment. Dhlamini and the others promptly applied for a permanent <a href="stay%20of%20execution">stay of execution</a>.

At the hearing for Dhlamini and Mlambo on 4 March 1968, Beadle dismissed the statement from London, saying it was a decision by the UK government and not the Queen herself, and that in any case the 1961 constitution had transferred the prerogative of mercy from Britain to the Rhodesian Executive Council. "The present government is the fully "de facto" government and as such is the only power that can exercise the prerogative," he concluded. "It would be strange indeed if the United Kingdom government, exercising no internal power in Rhodesia, were given the right to exercise the prerogative of clemency." The Judge President Sir Vincent Quenet and Justice <a href="Hector%20Macdonald%20%28judge%29">Hector Macdonald</a> agreed, and the application was dismissed. Dhlamini, Mlambo and Shadreck were hanged two days later.

Justice <a href="John%20Fieldsend">John Fieldsend</a> of the High Court's General Division resigned in protest, writing to Gibbs that he no longer believed the High Court to be defending the rights of Rhodesian citizens. Beadle told reporters that "Her Majesty is quite powerless in this matter," and that "it is to be deplored that the Queen was brought into this". At Government House, the Chief Justice berated Gibbs for "dragging the Queen into the political argument". To the Governor's astonishment, Beadle conceded that for some time he had no longer considered himself to be sitting under the 1961 constitution, but had not made this clear as he had not fully accepted the 1965 constitution as valid. Gibbs told him to leave Government House forthwith. They never met again.

In his analysis of Beadle's behaviour, Manuele Facchini suggests that the Chief Justice considered the matter from a <a href="dominion">dominion</a>-style viewpoint—by stressing the 1961 constitution and the rights held by Salisbury thereunder, he was repudiating not the royal prerogative itself, but rather the attempt to exercise it at the behest of British rather than Rhodesian ministers. Kenneth Young comments that the British government's involvement of the Queen inadvertently strengthened the post-UDI authorities' position; outraged, many in Rhodesia who had heretofore rejected UDI now threw their weight behind the RF. Beadle, deeply disillusioned, wrote to a friend that he was "thoroughly fed up with the way the Wilson government had behaved in this whole affair."

Madzimbamuto petitioned for the right to appeal against his detention to the Privy Council in London; the Rhodesian Appellate Division ruled that he had no right to do so, but the Privy Council <a href="Madzimbamuto%20v.%20Lardner-Burke">considered his case</a> anyway. It ruled in his favour on 23 July 1968, deciding that orders for detention made by the Rhodesian government were invalid regardless of whether they were under the 1961 or 1965 constitution, and that Madzimbamuto was illegally detained. Harry Elinder Davies, one of the Rhodesian judges, announced on 8 August that the Rhodesian courts would not consider this ruling binding as they no longer accepted the Privy Council as part of the Rhodesian judicial hierarchy. Justice J R Dendy Young resigned in protest at Davies's ruling on 12 August and four days later became Chief Justice of Botswana. Madzimbamuto would remain in prison until 1974.

Beadle and his judges granted full "de jure" recognition to the post-UDI government on 13 September 1968, while rejecting the appeals of 32 black nationalists who one month earlier had been convicted of terrorist offences and sentenced to death. Beadle declared that while he believed the Rhodesian judiciary should respect rulings of the Privy Council "so far as possible", the judgement of 23 July had made it legally impossible for Rhodesian judges to continue under the 1961 constitution. He asserted that as he could not countenance a legal vacuum, the only alternative was the 1965 constitution. Referring to the Privy Council's decision that the UK might yet remove the post-UDI government, he said that "on the facts as they exist today, the only prediction which this court can make is that sanctions will not succeed in overthrowing the present government ... and that there are no other factors which might succeed in doing so". UDI, the associated 1965 constitution and the government were thereafter considered "de jure" by the Rhodesian legal system.

The British Commonwealth Secretary <a href="George%20Thomson%2C%20Baron%20Thomson%20of%20Monifieth">George Thomson</a> expressed outrage, accusing Beadle and the other judges of breaching "the fundamental laws of the land", while Gibbs stated that since his position as governor existed under the 1961 constitution he could only reject the ruling. An internal UK Foreign Office memorandum rejected Beadle's argument but recognised his belief that "because of the effect of the effluxion of time, he was entitled to take a different view", and concluded that the Chief Justice's argument was "sufficiently plausible to make it difficult to say that that position is manifestly improper or that, in adopting it, Sir Hugh Beadle is manifestly guilty of misconduct." Beadle explained in a 1972 interview: "We had been doing our best to try and uphold the law and when the thing was in the revolutionary stage we dug our toes in, we wouldn't budge. But then as the government became more and more entrenched we had to apply the principle of law, which says that if a revolution succeeds the law changes with it. Yet because we accepted the inevitable we're blamed by a lot of people for being responsible for the revolution, which is a very different thing."

Beadle's acceptance of the post-UDI order effectively placed him on the side of the RF and removed any chance of his regaining an intermediary role with Wilson. The British Prime Minister minimised the political impact of the Chief Justice's decision by presenting it as evidence that Beadle had furtively supported UDI all along, and subsequently excluded him from the diplomatic dialogue. Wilson pursued a second initiative which led to a fresh round of talks with Smith off Gibraltar aboard <a href="HMS%20Fearless%20%28L10%29">HMS "Fearless"</a> in October 1968. Marked progress towards agreement was made but the Rhodesian delegation demurred on a new British proposal, the "double safeguard". This would involve elected black Rhodesians controlling a blocking quarter in the Rhodesian parliament, with the power to veto retrogressive legislation, and thereafter having the right to appeal passed bills to the Privy Council in London. Smith's team accepted the principle of the blocking quarter but agreement could not be reached on the technicalities; the involvement of the Privy Council was rejected by Smith as a "ridiculous" provision that would prejudice Rhodesia's sovereignty. The talks ended without success.

Smith's government held a <a href="Rhodesian%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%201969">referendum</a> on 20 June 1969 in which the mostly white electorate overwhelmingly voted in favour of both a new constitution and the declaration of a republic. Four days later the UK Foreign Office released Gibbs from his post, withdrew the British residual mission in Salisbury and closed the post-UDI government's representative office at <a href="Embassy%20of%20Zimbabwe%2C%20London">Rhodesia House</a> in London. The 1969 constitution introduced a <a href="President%20of%20Rhodesia">President</a> as head of state, a multiracial senate, separate black and white electoral rolls (each with qualifications) and a mechanism whereby the number of black MPs would increase in line with the proportion of income tax revenues paid by black citizens. This process would stop once blacks had the same number of seats as whites; the declared goal was not majority rule, but rather "parity between the races".
<a href="Michael%20Stewart%2C%20Baron%20Stewart%20of%20Fulham">Michael Stewart</a>, Wilson's <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs">Foreign Secretary</a>, recommended that Britain take preliminary steps towards removing Beadle from the Privy Council if the Chief Justice did not resign or dissociate himself from the republic "within a week or two" after the new constitution came into force. Given the gravity of such an action—only one Privy Counsellor, <a href="Edgar%20Speyer">Edgar Speyer</a>, was struck off the list during the 20th century—and the likelihood that accusations of vindictiveness would result, the British government was loath to do this, and hoped that Beadle would remove the need for it by resigning.

Smith officially declared a republic on 2 March 1970, and on 10 April the RF was decisively returned to power in the first republican <a href="Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201970">election</a>, winning all 50 white seats out of a total of 66. Six days later, Dupont was sworn in as the first president of Rhodesia. British officials learned only from the Rhodesian radio that Dupont's oath of office was administered not by Beadle but by the "Acting Chief Justice", Hector Macdonald. Beadle's absence prompted speculation in British quarters, but this promptly dissipated after "<a href="The%20Herald%20%28Zimbabwe%29">The Rhodesia Herald</a>" reported on 29 April that a High Court farewell to Sir Vincent Quenet, a retiring judge, would be presided over by the republic's Chief Justice Sir Hugh Beadle.

On 6 May 1970, Stewart suggested to Wilson that they should formally advise the Queen to remove Beadle from the Privy Council. Wilson resolved to wait until after the British <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201970">general election</a> the following month. This decision proved decisive for Beadle as, to the surprise of many, the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservatives</a> won the election, and <a href="Edward%20Heath">Edward Heath</a> replaced Wilson as prime minister. Heath's government decided against removing Beadle from the Privy Council, surmising that this would only hinder progress towards an accommodation with Smith. Beadle remained a Privy Counsellor for the rest of his life.

In May 1973 Beadle chaired the High Court appeal hearing for <a href="Peter%20Niesewand">Peter Niesewand</a>, a freelance reporter for the overseas press who had been convicted of espionage under the Official Secrets Act, prompting outcry abroad. Niesewand had written three articles in November 1972 claiming to describe the Rhodesian military's plans for <a href="Rhodesian%20Bush%20War">combating</a> communist-backed black nationalist guerrillas, and had been sentenced by a magistrate to two years' hard labour, one year <a href="Suspended%20sentence">suspended</a>. Beadle, Goldin and Macdonald rejected the state prosecution and unanimously overturned the conviction, ruling that Niesewand's reports had embarrassed the government but did not damage the Rhodesian state. "Factual evidence as opposed to opinion was never given," Beadle commented. The government promptly expelled Niesewand from Rhodesia.

After Olive's death in a motor accident in 1974, Beadle married Pleasance Johnson in 1976. He retired as Chief Justice in 1977; Macdonald succeeded him. For the rest of his life, Beadle served as an acting judge in special trials where suspected insurgents were tried for terrorist offences carrying the death penalty. In March 1977 he refused to try Abel Mapane and Jotha Bango, two Botswana citizens facing arms charges, ruling that since Rhodesia and Botswana were not at war and the Rhodesian Army had crossed into Botswana to capture the accused, the court had no jurisdiction. "Were it not so it would mean this Court condoned the illegal abduction of Botswana nationals," he explained.

Beadle continued to serve under the short-lived, unrecognised government of <a href="Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia">Zimbabwe Rhodesia</a>, which replaced the Rhodesian republic in June 1979, and under the British interim authorities following the <a href="Lancaster%20House%20Agreement">Lancaster House Agreement</a> of December that year. Following fresh <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201980">elections</a> in February–March 1980, the UK granted independence to Zimbabwe under the leadership of <a href="Robert%20Mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a> in April. Beadle died, aged 75, in <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a> on 14 December 1980. Hugh Beadle Primary School in Bulawayo retains its name in the 21st century.

"A short, stocky man of ruddy complexion with a toothbrush moustache," Claire Palley writes, "Beadle had a blunt manner, looking hard at all whom he encountered. His drive and enthusiasm were overwhelming, whether at work, in charitable activities, or as a courageous hunter and fisherman. He had a warm family life and many friends." According to J R T Wood, Wilson "hated Beadle perhaps because Beadle was clever but spoke his mind"; the British Prime Minister described Beadle to <a href="Cuthbert%20Alport%2C%20Baron%20Alport">Lord Alport</a> shortly after UDI as combining "the courage of a lion" with "the smartness of a fox". In <a href="Robert%20Blake%2C%20Baron%20Blake">Robert Blake</a>'s "History of Rhodesia", Beadle is characterised as "an irrepressible, bouncy extrovert, who does not always perceive the reaction which he causes in others." <a href="Garfield%20Todd">Sir Garfield Todd</a>, Southern Rhodesia's prime minister from 1956 to 1958, saw Beadle as "impulsive" and "always inclined to overstate his case".

The black nationalist movement regarded Beadle as a white supremacist, pointing to his 1959 preventive detention ruling as evidence. Wilson and other British figures saw him as two-faced for first supporting Gibbs, then declaring Smith's post-UDI government legal, and concluded that the judge must have always been a furtive UDI supporter, a theory that many have accepted. Wilson's private assistant <a href="Marcia%20Falkender%2C%20Baroness%20Falkender">Marcia Falkender</a> identified Beadle as "the villain of the piece", while Bottomley dubbed him UDI's "evil genius". Others, including Palley, Wood and Facchini, contend that Beadle was determined to avert UDI and afterwards sincere in his search for an accommodation until he came to believe this was not possible. "Beadle accepted the rebellion when he realised that he was identifying himself with 'the code of an Empire that had ceased to exist'," Facchini concludes. "Thus, he retained his Privy Counsellorship as a vestige of the Rhodesia he had known all his life."

Palley asserts that but for UDI, "Beadle would have been remembered as a Commonwealth chief justice who upheld individual liberty". "The thing that I've regretted most is this UDI and also I've regretted more than anything the fact that later it wasn't settled," Beadle said in 1972; "I think it could have been settled at a much earlier stage if Wilson had been a bit more reasonable." Julian Greenfield, a close friend and colleague of Beadle, considered him "one who put service to the country first and foremost and laboured unceasingly on what he believed to be its true interests." According to Palley, Beadle's own view was similar—that "he did his best for his country in a time of difficult choices".

Florence Nagle

Florence Nagle (26 October 1894 – 30 October 1988) was a trainer and breeder of <a href="horse%20racing">racehorse</a>s, a breeder of <a href="purebred">pedigree</a> dogs, and an active <a href="feminist">feminist</a>. Nagle purchased her first <a href="Irish%20Wolfhound">Irish Wolfhound</a> in 1913, and went on to own or breed twenty-one United Kingdom Champions. Best in Show at <a href="Crufts">Crufts</a> in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman, who was bred, owned and exhibited by Nagle. She also competed successfully in field trials with <a href="Irish%20Setter">Irish Setter</a>s, from the 1920s until the mid-1960s resulting in eighteen Field Trial Champions. The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the <a href="Irish%20Red%20and%20White%20Setter">Irish Red and White Setter</a> breed was descended from one of Nagle's Irish Setters.

Described as "the <a href="Emmeline%20Pankhurst">Mrs. Pankhurst</a> of British horse racing", Nagle <a href="horse%20trainer">trained</a> her first racehorse in 1920, the Irish-bred colt Fernley. At that time women were forced to employ men to hold a <a href="Jockey%20Club">Jockey Club</a> trainers licence on their behalf, or to have licences in their husbands' names. Nagle worked peacefully to redress such injustices to her sex. She successfully challenged the well-established leading gentlemen's clubs of the racing and canine worlds over their gender inequality, and in 1966 became one of the first two women in the United Kingdom licensed to train racehorses. The first racehorse officially trained in Nagle's name was Mahwa, registered as being owned by her friend Miss Newton Deakin, with whom she jointly owned some of her dogs.

Dissatisfied with the lack of opportunities for women jockeys, Nagle sponsored the Florence Nagle Girl Apprentices' Handicap first run in 1986 at <a href="Kempton%20Park%20Racecourse">Kempton Park</a>. She died at her home in <a href="West%20Chiltington">West Chiltington</a>, Sussex, two years later at the age of 94, leaving funds in her will for the continuation of the race.
Born in <a href="Fallowfield">Fallowfield</a>, Manchester, Nagle was the daughter of <a href="Watson%20baronets%23Watson%20baronets%2C%20of%20Sulhamstead%20%281912%29">Sir William George Watson, 1st Baronet of Sulhamstead</a> (1861–1930) and his second wife Bessie (née Atkinson); she was also the elder sister of art connoisseur <a href="Peter%20Watson%20%28arts%20benefactor%29">Peter Watson</a>. Nagle was educated at <a href="Wycombe%20Abbey">Wycombe Abbey</a> before studying domestic economy at Evendine Court, from which she was expelled after visiting <a href="Worcester%20Cathedral">Worcester Cathedral</a> without permission. Accompanied by the daughter of a <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a>, Nagle had hired a car for the excursion – she was one of the first women in Berkshire to hold a driving licence, gaining it when she was fifteen years old. Her education was completed at a <a href="finishing%20school">finishing school</a> after which she spent some time in Paris, where she became friends with <a href="Megan%20Lloyd%20George">Megan Lloyd George</a>.

Sulhamstead Abbots, Nagle's family home in Berkshire, was used as a hospital during the First World War. There she met James Nagle, a native of Ireland who had emigrated to Canada but returned to serve with the <a href="King%27s%20Royal%20Rifle%20Corps">King's Royal Rifle Corps</a> and then had been sent to Sulhamstead Abbots to recuperate. Against her parents' wishes the couple were married on 1 July 1916, resulting in them threatening to disinherit her. The early days of Nagle's marriage were hard; she was used to a wealthy lifestyle – her family money came from her father's successful business, <a href="Maypole%20Dairies">Maypole Dairies</a> – but her parents offered the couple no financial assistance. Nagle always worked hard and subsidised their income by making <a href="cream%20tea">cream tea</a>s, cleaning windows and scrubbing toilets. The couple had two children, a son, David, and a daughter, Patricia.
The marriage was not a success, and her husband ran off with one of the kennel maids. Obtaining a divorce was not easy in the 1920s; when asked in court for the reason James left, Nagle answered "He must have got bored with me." The divorce took place in 1928, five years before her husband's death. At the time of the divorce she was living on a <a href="smallholding">smallholding</a> near Headley, but returned to Sulhamstead in 1932 after inheriting land and money from Sir William. Ten years later, in 1942, she purchased Westerlands, a farm in <a href="Petworth">Petworth</a>, so she could personally oversee the stables.

Working in Folkestone during the Second World War, Nagle managed a canteen for the <a href="Air%20Raid%20Precautions">ARP</a>. She also donated the full cost of £5,000 to purchase a <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfire</a> named Sulhamstead for the Royal Air Force.

As a child, Nagle had a <a href="Pomeranian%20%28dog%29">Pomeranian</a> and a <a href="Bulldog">Bulldog</a>, but was promised she could have a larger dog once her schooling was completed. In 1913 her dream came to fruition with the purchase of her first Irish Wolfhound, Manin Michael, for £5. James Nagle subsequently registered the dog with the <a href="The%20Kennel%20Club">Kennel Club</a>, before it was transferred to the ownership of Mr and Mrs Nagle, and its name changed to Sir Michael of Sheppey in May 1917. Food shortages during the First World War resulted in an official prohibition on dog breeding, but Nagle ignored it and bred her first litter from a bitch called Lady Alma of Sheppey.

During her marriage, while residing in Concara, <a href="Sulhamstead">Sulhamstead</a>, near <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a>, she began breeding dogs and served as a judge of <a href="Irish%20Wolfhound">Irish Wolfhound</a>s and <a href="Setter">Setter</a>s; <a href="Great%20Dane">Great Dane</a>s and <a href="Deerhound">Deerhound</a>s were other breeds she judged at championship show level. Her dogs were exhibited at shows by her husband, who was also a judge of Wolfhounds, and they were entered in his name until the couple divorced.

A bitch puppy, the <a href="runt">runt</a> of the litter, was purchased for £48 in 1923 and she became Nagle's first dog to gain the title of Champion. Named Sulhamstead Thelma, she was declared the best Irish Wolfhound bitch and awarded the Challenge Certificate at three consecutive <a href="Crufts">Crufts</a>, in 1925, 1926 and 1927. Her next Champion was Sulhamstead Conncara, a male dog, born in 1925. Conncara was blind, possibly owing to an accident as a young puppy, but Nagle kept that secret until three years after his death, believing that his qualities would have been overlooked by other breeders if they had known. According to Nagle's biographer, <a href="Ferelith%20Somerfield">Ferelith Somerfield</a>, this dog was "one of the great sires of all time in the breed" and an "outstanding show dog". A prepotent sire, he produced several Champions and other top-class show specimens.

Nagle owned or bred forty-five Wolfhounds who were awarded Challenge Certificates, twenty-one of them Champions. She believed dogs should be capable of carrying out the work the breed was developed to do, and she promoted <a href="hare%20coursing">coursing</a>.

Irish Wolfhounds bred by Nagle were also successful in America; she began exporting dogs there in 1933. Best of breed awards at the Irish Wolfhound Club of America speciality shows were secured by Champion Sulhamstead Matador of Killybracken in 1960 and by Sulhamstead Mars of Riverlawn in 1963. She also judged the national speciality there twice and judged Irish Setters and Irish Wolfhounds at <a href="Westminster%20Kennel%20Club%20Dog%20Show">Westminster</a> in 1937. Other countries she exported Wolfhounds to included Sweden, Italy and Uruguay. As late as 1960, Sulhamstead Merman, a 150-pound Irish Wolfhound bred, owned and shown by Nagle at "London's big dog show", Crufts, won the <a href="Hound%20Group">Hound Group</a> and went on to be declared Best in Show or "supreme champion"; the judges were <a href="H.%20S.%20Lloyd">H. S. Lloyd</a> and Fred Cross. She judged the breed twice at Crufts: in 1961, the only time in a nine-year period her dogs were not best of breed there; and in 1970.

Nagle acquired her first <a href="Irish%20Setter">Irish Setter</a>, whom she named Sulhamstead D'Or, in 1924 to keep a wolfhound puppy company. In April 1930 she entered him into the All-Aged Stakes at the Kennel Club <a href="field%20trial">field trial</a>s. In August 1932 she entered a dog named Sulhamstead Token D'Or into the Scottish Field Trials in the same category. At the Kennel Club field trials of April 1933, Nagle entered Sulhamstead Bob D'Or into the All-Aged Stakes and the judge awarded her the prize presented by the <a href="Irish%20Setter%20Association%20of%20England">Irish Setter Association of England</a>. In September 1934, she entered her Irish Setter Sulhamstead Snip D'Or into the Novice Stake of the Devon and Cornwall Pointer and Setter Society's 12th working trials at <a href="Pynes%20House">Pynes</a>, near <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>.

In July 1935 Nagle entered the field trials of the Irish Setter Association near <a href="Ruabon">Ruabon</a> in North Wales, competing in the Open Stake for Irish Setters and the Puppy Stake for Irish Setters, for puppies which were born the previous year. At the 35th International Gun Dog League trials held at <a href="Douglas%20Castle">Douglas Castle</a> in August 1935, she was awarded a diploma in the Champion Stakes for Pointers and Setters. The following month, Nagle took the silver perpetual challenge trophy in the Open Stake of the field trials of the Devon and Cornwall Pointer and Setter Society at <a href="Newlyn">Newlyn</a>, near <a href="Newquay">Newquay</a>, competing with her Irish Setter Sulhamstead Baffle D'Or. At the Kennel Club field trials for pointers and setters in April 1936, she entered Sulhamstead Bluff D'Or into the All-Aged Stake and was awarded the Penheale Challenge Cup by Captain N. R. Colville for the "best constitutioned dog or bitch, displaying the greatest game-finding ability". At the 18th annual Scottish Field Trial Association's field trials for pointers and setters at Yester estate in <a href="Gifford%2C%20East%20Lothian">Gifford, East Lothian</a>, Scotland in August 1936, Nagle won first prize in the Brace Stake with Sulhamstead Bluff D'Or. The Kennel Club own a pastel painting by <a href="Cecil%20Aldin">Cecil Aldin</a> of two of Nagle's Irish Setters, the Field Trial Champions Sulhamstead Sheilin D'Or and Sulhamstead Valla D'Or. Field trials saw a general downturn in popularity of Irish Setters competing in the 1930s; during the following decade the breed was principally represented by Nagle's dogs. Nagle had eighteen Irish Setter field trial champions during the period she was active in the breed from the 1920s to the mid-1960s. The male dog Harlequin of Knockalla was pivotal in the revival of the <a href="Irish%20Red%20and%20White%20Setter">Irish Red and White Setter</a> breed in the 1970s; he was a descendant of Nagle's Irish Setter Sulhamstead Natty D'Or, so the Sulhamstead bloodline is behind most modern day red and whites. Nagle withdrew from the field-trial scene in the mid-1960s following the retirement of her handler, George Abbott.

Other breeds she owned included <a href="Golden%20Retriever">Golden Retriever</a>s and <a href="Pointer%20%28dog%20breed%29">Pointer</a>s. Nagle's activities were not confined to dogs and horses. A <a href="Berkshire%20%28pig%29">Berkshire boar</a> named Pamber Ugly Duckling was champion at the <a href="Royal%20Show">Royal Show</a> in 1921. Later he was exported to <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, after the purchaser paid what at the time was a record price of £750. During the 1930s she owned Prince Everett of Auchterarder, a prize-winning <a href="Aberdeen%20Angus">Aberdeen Angus</a>.

According to the "Encyclopedia of British Horseracing", Nagle trained her first racehorse in 1920, the Irish-bred <a href="colt%20%28horse%29">colt</a> Fernley. Her fascination with the sport stemmed from a much earlier time pre-dating her decision to concentrate on breeding dogs but it was particularly the breeding aspect of racehorses she was drawn to. Nagle owned the winner of the Newport Nursery Handicap in 1932, a horse named Solano, and a reporter recorded that "While Solano is not Mrs Nagle's first winner, it is some years since the 'rifle green, red cross-belts' caught the judge's eye". On 5 July 1935, she entered her racehorse Comanche at <a href="Newmarket%20Racecourse">Newmarket</a>.

Nagle entered <a href="Epsom%20Derby">The Derby</a> in 1937; that horse, Sandsprite, ridden by <a href="John%20Crouch%20%28jockey%29">John Crouch</a> at odds of 100–1, finished second to <a href="Mid-day%20Sun">Mid-day Sun</a>, owned by Mrs Lettice Miller, the first woman owner ever to win the Derby. This was the first horse Nagle bred herself and reactions from commentators were mixed. One report described the horse as a "commanding individual", whereas another reporter's opposing opinion was revealed by Nagle when after Sandsprite's success at Epsom she stated "Not bad for a horse which one newspaper said was only good enough to give rides at the seaside". Sandsprite's dam was Wood Nymph, a mare purchased by Nagle for 240 <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a>. She wanted to have her mated by the stallion <a href="Sansovino%20%28horse%29">Sansovino</a> but had to settle for using his son, Sandwich, as she could not afford his <a href="stud%20fee">stud fee</a>. Sandsprite had several other outings in which he gained second or third placings, but was put down at the onset of his stud career after breaking a leg.

One of Nagle's early equine purchases was 15-year-old Rose of England, the winner of the 1930 <a href="Epsom%20Oaks">Oaks</a>, for 3,500 guineas. The mare had already produced the 1937 <a href="St.%20Leger%20Stakes">St. Leger</a> winner, Chulmleigh, and the 1939 top winning two-year-old, British Empire. In Nagle's ownership she foaled Westerlands Rose, by the stallion <a href="Colombo%20%28horse%29">Colombo</a> who produced several winners. These included Westerlands Chalice, by <a href="Chamossaire%20%28horse%29">Chamossaire</a>, who won three races in 1957; and Game Rose, by <a href="Big%20Game%20%28horse%29">Big Game</a>, another winner during the 1950s. Other winning progeny from Westerlands Rose were Westerlands Champagne, Westerlands Prince and Westerlands Rosebud. These five horses accounted for ten race wins between them.

At the December <a href="Newmarket%2C%20Suffolk">Newmarket</a> sales in 1944 Nagle bought the two-year old Carpatica, by the Epsom Derby winner, <a href="Hyperion%20%28horse%29">Hyperion</a> out of Campanula, the <a href="1%2C000%20Guineas%20Stakes">1,000 Guineas Stakes</a> winner, for a record 15,000 guineas with the intention of looking after the <a href="filly">filly</a>'s training at her stables in Petworth. She also bought a five-year-old mare in foal, Hay Harvest, for 5,500 guineas. When bred to <a href="Sayajirao">Sayajirao</a>, Carpatica produced the 1950s winner, <a href="Cavina">Cavina</a>.

One of the main winners in the Nagle stables in the early 1960s was Gelert, trained by Nagle and owned by Miss Newton Deakin. Sired by <a href="Owen%20Tudor%20%28horse%29">Owen Tudor</a> out of Westerlands Rosebud, he won a race at <a href="Ascot%20Racecourse">Ascot</a>. His dam had been successfully raced in the early 1950s and then proved herself as a useful brood.

In the first half of the 20th century women trainers were not unknown – <a href="Norah%20Wilmot">Norah Wilmot</a> was training horses for <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">The Queen</a>. But women trained in an unofficial capacity, and were forced to employ men to hold the training licence on their behalf, or to have licences in their husbands' names. Thus, beginning in 1932, the divorced Nagle employed Alfred Stickley, a licensed trainer, to work at her stables in the capacity of head lad. Mahwa, by Match III out of Media, was owned by Newton Deakin and was the first winning horse to be officially listed as trained by Nagle. As late as 1975, she trained twelve horses and recommended feeding them some seaweed to provide iodine. She was also a great believer in the beneficial effects of fresh air, insisting that her horses' top stable doors were permanently left open. She was vehemently opposed to the vaccination of horses against <a href="equine%20influenza">equine influenza</a>, and challenged a <a href="Jockey%20Club">Jockey Club</a> decision to make vaccination compulsory. She thought the hardest part of animal breeding was "to breed for 'guts'. You can produce lovely looking animals that go well – till they are on a race course with a stiff race to win."

For twenty years Nagle worked to end the Jockey Club's ban on licensing women as race horse trainers, which she saw as an injustice: eventually, frustrated by the Jockey Club's persistent refusal to grant training licences to women, Nagle sought legal redress. It has been suggested that the club used its considerable influence within the <a href="The%20Establishment">Establishment</a> to have her claim blocked twice. Her fight finally reached the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Court of Appeal</a> in 1966. Following her third appearance in court, Nagle emerged victorious. The verdict of the three presiding judges, <a href="Alfred%20Denning%2C%20Baron%20Denning">Lord Denning</a>, <a href="Harold%20Danckwerts">Lord Justice Dankwerts</a> and <a href="Cyril%20Salmon%2C%20Baron%20Salmon">Lord Justice Salmon</a>, was, in the words of Lord Denning, that "If she is to carry on her trade without stooping to subterfuge she has to have a licence." Lord Denning went on to describe the refusal to grant Nagle a training licence as "arbitrary and capricious", and Lord Justice Danckwerts called it "restrictive and nonsensical". Of the Jockey Club itself, Lord Justice Danckwerts went on to pronounce that "The courts have the right to protect the right of a person to work when it is being prevented by the dictatorial powers of a body which holds a monopoly." All three judges also referred to the <a href="Sex%20Disqualification%20%28Removal%29%20Act%201919">Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919</a>. Faced with the court's damning and embarrassing decision, the Jockey Club capitulated, and on 3 August 1966 Florence Nagle and Norah Wilmot became the first women in Britain to receive licences to train racehorses.

Nagle credited herself with "dragging the Jockey Club into the twentieth century". She said: "This was a matter of principle. I am a feminist. I believe in equal rights for women. Things should be decided by ability, not sex". At odds with Nagle's view, in her court case Lord Justice Salmon commented that "No doubt there are occupations, such as boxing, which may be reasonably regarded inherently unsuitable for women", and Lord Denning had gone on to say that "It is not as if the training of horses could be regarded as an unsuitable occupation for a woman, like that of a jockey or speedway-rider"; it was another eight years before Jockey Club rules permitted women jockeys in 1972. When asked by a journalist in the late 1970s if she thought women could ever match men on the racecourse, Nagle replied: "My dear man, it used to be said women couldn't stand up to three-day-eventing. Now they're beating the men regularly – and the same will happen in racing. Give them time." Her endeavours led to her being described as "the Mrs Pankhurst of British horse racing" in "Stud & Stable Magazine" and "Racing's Emily Pankhurst".

At the age of 83 Nagle was still pursuing gender equality, accusing the Kennel Club of sexual discrimination in their insistence on male-only membership and taking them to court over the matter. After the <a href="Sex%20Discrimination%20Act%201975">Sex Discrimination Act 1975</a> was enacted, Nagle was proposed as a member of the Kennel Club at the end of September 1977; the nomination was refused in January 1978 because the Kennel Club's constitution restricted membership to men only. Nagle referred the matter to an <a href="Industrial%20Tribunal">Industrial Tribunal</a> five months later. She was Chairwoman of the Ladies Joint Committee, a group set up in 1975 as a part of the Kennel Club hierarchy, but the committee was not allowed any input into general club decisions. Her actions against the club were fully supported by the other members of the Ladies Committee. Legal technicalities caused the tribunal to reject the case, but it recommended that the <a href="Equal%20Opportunities%20Commission%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Equal Opportunities Commission</a> should be approached as discrimination was clearly demonstrated. Nagle was determined and stated her intention to appeal the decision. <a href="Leonard%20Pagliero">Leonard Pagliero</a> was Chairman of the Kennel Club at the time, and before Nagle was able to complete the appeal he contacted the canine press, "<a href="Dog%20World%20%28newspaper%29">Dog World</a>" and "Our Dogs", on 8 September 1978 announcing that the Club's General Committee was recommending that the club's constitution be changed to allow women members. The proposal was carried unanimously at a meeting held on 23 November 1978. The result was that Nagle and many other ladies were accepted as members of the Kennel Club at a formal meeting held on 10 April 1979. The total number of women approved for membership at the landmark meeting was 80; the costs of the campaign were funded by Nagle.

In the 1980s, still dissatisfied with the lack of opportunities for women jockeys, Nagle sponsored a race at <a href="Kempton%20Park%20Racecourse">Kempton Park</a>, The Florence Nagle Girl Apprentices' Handicap. The first event took place in 1986; after the race <a href="John%20Oaksey">John Oaksey</a> wrote in the "Daily Telegraph" that Nagle was no doubt looking down from her celestial cloud with approval. She subsequently wrote to inform him that she was still alive, but that when the time came she expected to end up in a hotter place – "and there to meet most of her racing friends". Nagle left a bequest in her will to ensure the race's survival.

Nagle died at her home, Little Mayfield in West Chiltington, Sussex, at the age of 94.

Hurricane Gonzalo

Hurricane Gonzalo was the second <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a>, after <a href="Hurricane%20Fay">Hurricane Fay</a>, to directly strike the island of <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> in a one-week time frame in October 2014, and was the first <a href="SSHS%23Category%204">Category 4 Atlantic hurricane</a> since <a href="Hurricane%20Ophelia%20%282011%29">Hurricane Ophelia</a> in <a href="2011%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">2011</a>. At the time, it was the strongest hurricane in the Atlantic since <a href="Hurricane%20Igor">Igor</a> in 2010. Gonzalo struck Bermuda less than a week after the surprisingly fierce Fay; 2014 was the first season in recorded history to feature two hurricane landfalls in Bermuda. A powerful <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane">Atlantic tropical cyclone</a> that wrought destruction in the <a href="Leeward%20Islands">Leeward Islands</a> and Bermuda, Gonzalo was the seventh named storm, sixth and final hurricane and only the second major hurricane of the below-average <a href="2014%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">2014 Atlantic hurricane season</a>. The storm formed from a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> on October 12, while located east of the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>. It made landfall on <a href="Antigua">Antigua</a>, <a href="Saint%20Martin">Saint Martin</a>, and <a href="Anguilla">Anguilla</a> as a <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20hurricane%20wind%20scale">Category 1 hurricane</a>, causing damage on those and nearby islands. <a href="Antigua%20and%20Barbuda">Antigua and Barbuda</a> sustained US$40 million in losses, and boats were abundantly damaged or destroyed throughout the northern Leeward Islands. The storm killed three people on Saint Martin and <a href="Saint%20Barth%C3%A9lemy">Saint Barthélemy</a>. Gonzalo tracked northwestward as it intensified into a major hurricane. <a href="Eyewall%20replacement%20cycle">Eyewall replacement cycle</a>s led to fluctuations in the hurricane's structure and intensity, but on October 16, Gonzalo peaked with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph (230 km/h).

After Hurricane Fay caused extensive power outages on the island just days before, residents of Bermuda were forced to complete preparations for Gonzalo in haste. Banks, businesses, schools, and government offices closed in advance of the storm, while the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> ship <a href="HMS%20Argyll%20%28F231%29">HMS "Argyll"</a> left its post in the Caribbean to provide Bermuda with emergency assistance. The cyclone gradually weakened before crossing directly over central Bermuda at Category 2 strength around 00:30 <a href="Universal%20Coordinated%20Time">UTC</a> on October 18. Gonzalo battered the island with wind gusts as high as , downing hundreds of trees and creating widespread roof damage. At the height of the storm, about 31,000 out of 36,000 total electricity customers were without power; service was not fully restored until early November. Many roads were impassable immediately following the hurricane, and in many cases the damage done by Gonzalo was indistinguishable from that of Fay. <a href="Bermuda%20Regiment">Bermuda Regiment</a> soldiers and sailors from the "Argyll" took part in initial cleanup and repairs on the territory, and preliminary assessments revealed that the storm did not compare to the devastation of <a href="Hurricane%20Fabian">Hurricane Fabian</a> in 2003. Catastrophe modelling firms estimated that Bermuda suffered at least $200 million in insured losses, and despite the heavy disruptions, no deaths or serious injuries were reported there.

Departing Bermuda, Gonzalo accelerated toward the waters of the North Atlantic, passing close to southeastern <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a> before becoming <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical</a> on October 19. Gusty winds and bands of heavy rain in the southeastern <a href="Avalon%20Peninsula">Avalon Peninsula</a> engendered minor flooding and power outages. A large storm system involving the remnants of Gonzalo battered the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a> and central Europe on October 21, killing three people in the United Kingdom and severely hindering transportation. The system later played a role in triggering torrential rains over the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>, which resulted in severe flooding in Greece and Bulgaria.

Hurricane Gonzalo originated in a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> that emerged from the western coast of Africa on October 4 and trekked across the Atlantic. Despite an attendant expanse of clouds and thunderstorms, hostile winds from an <a href="cold-core%20low">upper-level trough</a> hindered <a href="cyclogenesis">cyclogenesis</a>. On October 10, after encountering an eastward-propagating <a href="Kelvin%20wave">Kelvin wave</a>, the system developed more concentrated <a href="convection%20%28meteorology%29">convection</a>. With conditions increasingly favorable for further development, the disturbance gradually became better organized, forming a small <a href="low%20pressure%20area">low pressure area</a> by October 11. In turn, a tropical depression formed at 00:00 <a href="Universal%20Coordinated%20Time">UTC</a> on October 12, located approximately 390 mi (630 km) east of the <a href="Leeward%20Islands">Leeward Islands</a>. Continued maturation amid warm waters and low <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> yielded Tropical Storm Gonzalo 12 hours later. Operationally, the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> (NHC) did not begin issuing advisories on the cyclone until midday on October 12, after a <a href="Hurricane%20Hunters">Hurricane Hunter</a> flight into the system reported <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">surface winds</a> of 40 mph (65 km/h).

A powerful <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a> over the central Atlantic steered the nascent storm westward toward the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>. Thunderstorm activity was strong near the center, although initially somewhat disorganized and asymmetric. However, a tight inner core soon took shape, and Gonzalo began to quickly intensify throughout the day on October 12. Following the appearance of an <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye feature</a> early the next day, the storm was upgraded to a <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20hurricane%20wind%20scale">Category 1 hurricane</a> while located near <a href="Antigua">Antigua</a> in the eastern Caribbean. Shortly thereafter, the storm passed directly over the island. The hurricane later struck <a href="Saint%20Martin">Saint Martin</a> and <a href="Anguilla">Anguilla</a>, and skirted just north of the <a href="British%20Virgin%20Islands">British Virgin Islands</a> while continuing to intensify. By that time, it was headed toward the northwest around the periphery of the aforementioned ridge.
On October 14, the eye contracted to a diameter of 17 mi (28 km) and improved its satellite presentation. At 18:00 UTC, Gonzalo strengthened to a Category 3 major hurricane while located about 170 mi (270 km) north of <a href="San%20Juan%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">San Juan, Puerto Rico</a>. Six hours later it became the first Category 4 hurricane in the Atlantic basin since <a href="Hurricane%20Ophelia%20%282011%29">Hurricane Ophelia</a> in 2011. Subsequently, a concentric eyewall structure indicated an imminent <a href="eyewall%20replacement%20cycle">eyewall replacement cycle</a>, with the inner feature "about as small as it can get" according to the NHC. The eyewall replacement cycle briefly disrupted the storm's core, causing Gonzalo to weaken slightly, but upon completion on the evening of October 15, the system stabilized and resumed intensification. While moving northward early the next day, Gonzalo reached its peak intensity with winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) and a <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> of 940 <a href="Bar%20%28unit%29">mbar</a> (<a href="Pascal%20%28unit%29">hPa</a>; 27.76 <a href="Inches%20of%20Mercury">inHg</a>). By evening it had turned north-northeastward, ahead of an advancing <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> over the eastern United States and in the wake of the receding ridge.

From the evening of October 16 through the next morning, the hurricane experienced further internal fluctuations as it approached Bermuda from the south-southwest. Concurrently, the storm began to weaken. In particular, cloud tops around the hurricane warmed, and convection became less uniform, likely attributable to cooler waters and heightened wind shear. The hurricane was downgraded to Category 2 as the northern eyewall crossed Bermuda, and at about 00:30 UTC on October 18, the center of circulation passed directly over the island, signalling an official <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a>. Along with Hurricane Fay, which struck Bermuda on October 12, this represented the first recorded instance of two hurricanes making landfall on the island within the same season. Moving away from Bermuda, the hurricane continued to degrade, but showed signs of increased organization later on October 18. As Gonzalo accelerated northeastward at over 50 mph (85 km/h), it passed about 50 miles (85 km) southeast of <a href="Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Newfoundland</a>'s <a href="Avalon%20Peninsula">Avalon Peninsula</a> early on October 19. In spite of sea surface temperatures below , the storm was able to maintain a <a href="central%20dense%20overcast">central dense overcast</a> and deep warm core. By 18:00 UTC, Gonzalo had finally succumbed to the cold environment and intense wind shear, completing its transition into a strong <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> about northeast of <a href="Cape%20Race">Cape Race</a>, Newfoundland. Gonzalo's remnants sped east-northeastward until a <a href="cold%20front">frontal boundary</a> absorbed it on October 20, to the south-southwest of <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>. The resultant system brought stormy weather to the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a> and parts of mainland Europe on October 21, and later contributed to the formation of a large <a href="Cut%20off%20low">cut-off low</a>.

When Gonzalo first formed, various governments across the eastern Caribbean issued <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches">tropical cyclone warnings and watches</a>, extending from <a href="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a> to the coast of <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>. As the storm was strengthening and moving through the region, a hurricane warning was issued for the British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, and Saint Martin. Several major cruise lines altered their itineraries to avoid the storm.

Late on October 14, while Gonzalo was still located about 700 miles (1,130 km) to the south, the <a href="Bermuda%20Weather%20Service">Bermuda Weather Service</a> issued a hurricane watch for the island. The watch was upgraded to a warning the next day. Having been affected by the unexpectedly destructive <a href="Hurricane%20Fay%20%282014%29">Hurricane Fay</a> just days earlier, residents quickly began preparing for Gonzalo by obtaining emergency supplies and expediting cleanup efforts from the previous storm. <a href="Premier%20of%20Bermuda">Premier of Bermuda</a> <a href="Michael%20Dunkley">Michael Dunkley</a> advised citizens to complete most preparations by the afternoon of October 16. Banks and businesses began closing that day, while schools and government offices were closed by October 17. One school functioned as a storm shelter, and 66 people ultimately sought refuge there. Bus and ferry services were suspended on the evening of October 16. Bermuda's only daily newspaper, the "<a href="The%20Royal%20Gazette%20%28Bermuda%29">Royal Gazette</a>", did not go to print on October 17, but distributed the next day's edition for free. <a href="Bermuda%20Regiment">Bermuda Regiment</a> soldiers were stationed at various points to support emergency response crews and ensure the safety of the public.

The Caribbean Electric Utility Services Corporation (CARILEC) sent linemen to assist the Bermuda Electric Light Company (BELCO) crews in the event of power outages from Gonzalo. Still completing restoration work after massive outages from Fay, BELCO stationed vehicles and supplies at strategic points on the island to prepare for the next hurricane. On the morning of October 16, BELCO switched its focus from Fay to Gonzalo, leaving around 1,500 households without power; the remaining affected customers were asked to refrain from calling to report outages. Ahead of the storm, the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> frigate <a href="HMS%20Argyll%20%28F231%29">HMS "Argyll"</a> sailed from the Caribbean to provide Bermuda with emergency assistance. Public beaches were closed as hurricane swells began to build, and the decision was made to shut down <a href="The%20Causeway%2C%20Bermuda">the Causeway</a> early on October 17, based on forecasts of long-duration severe winds. Additionally, <a href="L.F.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BWade%20International%20Airport">L.F. Wade International Airport</a> closed prior to the storm's onslaught, accounting for 62 canceled commercial flights. Three cruise ships were diverted from the island.

While moving through the northeastern Leeward Islands as a fledgling hurricane, Gonzalo produced sustained winds of on Antigua, with gusts to . Roads were blocked by uprooted trees, while numerous buildings, including several schools, received significant damage. Gonzalo caused an island-wide power outage, and its storm surge damaged boats. Schools and businesses were forced to close, and four emergency shelters opened to storm victims. Debris and flooding forced <a href="V.%20C.%20Bird%20International%20Airport">V. C. Bird International Airport</a> to delay its return to operation after closing as a precaution. Numerous homes sustained damage, largely to their roofs, with the <a href="Saint%20George%20Parish%2C%20Antigua%20and%20Barbuda">Saint George Parish</a> suffering the greatest losses. Farming communities and a variety of crops were severely impacted, which sparked concerns of imminent produce shortages. Some growers lost their entire banana crops.

<a href="Barbuda">Barbuda</a> experienced gusts as high as 70 mph (113 km/h), as well as radar-estimated rainfall of up to . Although Barbuda was subject to less widespread devastation than its twin island, there were still snapped tree limbs, reports of flooding, and disruptions to utility services. Damages to residences, government buildings, and agriculture on Antigua contributed to <a href="Antigua%20and%20Barbuda">Antigua and Barbuda</a>'s national storm cost of around US$40 million, which also includes compensation to <a href="American%20Airlines">American Airlines</a> for not meeting departing passenger quotas during the hurricane. Numerous individuals were treated for minor storm-related injuries, none of them life-threatening. Further west, Gonzalo caused minor power outages on <a href="Saint%20Kitts%20and%20Nevis">Saint Kitts and Nevis</a>, while a general of rain accompanied wind gusts to on Guadeloupe.
The storm wrecked dozens of boats around Saint Martin, including 22 in <a href="Simpson%20Bay%20Lagoon">Simpson Bay Lagoon</a>, and an elderly man aboard one of the stricken vessels was killed. Two people on Saint Martin and <a href="Saint%20Barth%C3%A9lemy">Saint Barthélemy</a> went missing in the storm, and were presumed dead after remaining unaccounted for several months later. Fourteen other missing individuals were returned alive. Winds on Saint Barthélemy blew sustained, with gusts to . Fallen trees obstructed streets, and an aircraft flipped over on a runway at <a href="Gustaf%20III%20Airport">Gustaf III Airport</a>. As many as 40 boats were reportedly beached on Saint Barthélemy.

On Saint Martin, sustained winds exceeded 60 mph (95 km/h), and <a href="L%27Esp%C3%A9rance%20Airport">L'Espérance Airport</a> recorded gusts to before the observing equipment failed. As much as of rain fell over the island. Reports of urban flooding and entrance of water into homes were common. Gonzalo impaired water and electricity services throughout Dutch Sint Marteen and inflicted significant damage to homes. The St. Maarten Zoo sustained heavy structural damage, though all resident animals survived unharmed. The French side of the island incurred relatively little destruction, with scattered roof and window damage, though Orient Beach "was a scene of complete devastation"; several businesses there suffered extensively. Emergency responders and military aircraft from <a href="Martinique">Martinique</a> were dispatched to aid in post-storm recovery on Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin.

Heavy rain on Anguilla flooded the <a href="Clayton%20J.%20Lloyd%20International%20Airport">Clayton J. Lloyd International Airport</a> and portions of several <a href="Districts%20of%20Anguilla">districts</a>, qualifying the government for a US$500,000 "excess rainfall" insurance payout. The eastern and western ends of the island bore the brunt of the storm, facing damage to utility poles, vegetation, and roofs, and public schools did not reopen until October 20 or later. The sole hospital experienced minor flood damage.

Gonzalo produced squally weather in parts of Puerto Rico and the <a href="Virgin%20Islands">Virgin Islands</a>, causing power outages and prompting 20 people to stay in an emergency shelter. <a href="Cyril%20E.%20King%20Airport">Cyril E. King Airport</a> on <a href="Saint%20Thomas%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint Thomas</a> was temporarily closed due to the storm; the airport endured blustery conditions, with gusts reaching . Elsewhere, rough seas affected parts of the <a href="Greater%20Antilles">Greater Antilles</a> and the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>.

Gonzalo generated hurricane-force winds across Bermuda over a period of about six hours, at their strongest from the northwest on the backside of the storm. Tropical storm conditions persisted for up to 24 hours. Elevated weather stations observed the highest winds; Commissioner's Point recorded 10-minute sustained winds of , and St. David's measured gusts as high as . Gusts reached at the Causeway, closer to sea level. The airport recorded of rain, but due to the strong winds, this was most likely an underestimation of what actually fell. The passage of the hurricane's eye was marked by diminished winds and a lack of rain, but a drizzle of ocean mist reportedly fell over the island. As Gonzalo struck at low tide, the effects of storm surge were minimal. At Esso Pier on the north side of the island, storm tides peaked at above normal.

The intense winds brought down utility poles and hundreds of trees (likely exacerbated by saturated ground from record rainfall in the months prior), leaving "barely a road" passable. The storm razed several invasive species, with endemic trees proving more resilient. A composting facility received 1,200 truckloads of plant debris per day after Fay and Gonzalo, up from an average of 100. Damage from the storms totaled around US$260,000 on <a href="Bermuda%20National%20Trust">Bermuda National Trust</a> properties, which include nature preserves and cemeteries. Similarly, the <a href="Bermuda%20Botanical%20Gardens">Bermuda Botanical Gardens</a> and Arboretum were closed due to safety hazards resulting from extensive vegetation damage.
The first storm-related power outages took place in the early afternoon on October 17 as weather conditions worsened. At the height of the storm, about 31,000 out of 36,000 electricity customers were without power, including the 1,500 outages left unresolved after Fay. Backup CARILEC crews helped with specialty assignments, such as commercial outages and homes without power since before Gonzalo's onslaught. Service was not fully restored until November 3, and BELCO ultimately spent US$2.9 million on system repairs after hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo. The company replaced 228 utility poles, 80 <a href="transformer">transformer</a>s, and over 4 mi (6.5 km) of wire. Other utilities, such as television and Internet services, also suffered, and technicians handled individual outages deep into the month of November. About 600 streetlights on main roads and several hundred more on side-streets were inoperative following the hurricane; some remained unmended through January 2015.

Structural damage ranged from the superficial to complete wall or roof failure, the latter being relatively uncommon. A multitude of buildings, including churches, a visitor's center, the <a href="House%20of%20Assembly%20of%20Bermuda">House of Assembly</a> building in Hamilton, and the Bermuda Police Service headquarters at <a href="Prospect%20Camp%2C%20Bermuda">Prospect Camp</a>, suffered some degree of roof damage. Older structures were particularly prone to substantial damage, as were commercial storage buildings subject to less strict building codes. In December, five new slate quarries were approved to accommodate the demand for roofing materials. Both the new and old portions of the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital received significant damage that exposed the facilities to the elements. An exhibit at the <a href="Bermuda%20Aquarium%2C%20Museum%20and%20Zoo">Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo</a> was unroofed, and coastal erosion threatened to encroach on the site, though no animals were harmed. Part of the structure's roof was blown a quarter mile (400 m).

L.F. Wade International Airport sustained some roof and runway lighting damage, and the <a href="Bermuda%20Weather%20Service">Bermuda Weather Service</a> building lost a storm shutter and saw water forced inside a communications room. A restaurant at the site of the <a href="Gibbs%20Hill%20Lighthouse">Gibbs Hill Lighthouse</a> was severely damaged, requiring a complete roof replacement. The Causeway was largely spared, with some damage to the safety walls alongside the road, and it was partially reopened on October 18 after initial repairs. However, one of two lanes remained shut down for several days. Many boats were washed ashore and damaged or wrecked by the storm, and other vessels tipped over in boatyards. According to preliminary estimates, properties in the <a href="Royal%20Navy%20Dockyard">Dockyard</a> alone incurred US$1 million (2014 <a href="Bermudian%20dollar">BMD</a>) in damage.
The strongest hurricane to directly affect Bermuda since 2003's <a href="Hurricane%20Fabian">Hurricane Fabian</a>, Gonzalo was generally less destructive. Damage modelling firms estimated insured losses from the hurricane to settle between US$200 and US$400 million, not including damage to watercraft, though the CEO of the largest property insurer on Bermuda believed losses to be much lower. It was estimated that a Fabian equivalence in 2014 would cause about US$650 million in damage. Some insurance companies decided to treat Fay and Gonzalo as a single event, allowing one deductible to count toward claims from both storms. After initial assessments, Premier Dunkley reported that the territory fared "much better than we expected", and the storm was not blamed for any deaths or major injuries on Bermuda.

In the aftermath of the hurricane, a Royal Navy helicopter aboard the "Argyll" flew out ahead of the ship to start aerial damage assessments. Members of the Bermuda Regiment immediately began cleanup and recovery efforts, while the government provided <a href="tarpaulin">tarps</a> to affected homeowners. Sailors from the "Argyll" teamed up with Regiment soldiers upon the ship's arrival to continue relief work. Some 35 of the vessel's crew members worked to clear debris from the runway at the airport, which reopened on October 19 after thorough evaluations. Including damage from Fay, about $2 million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited as evidence of the need for a newer terminal in a more protected location. All schools on the territory resumed classes by October 21.

On October 17, the <a href="Canadian%20Hurricane%20Centre">Canadian Hurricane Centre</a> issued a tropical storm watch for the Avalon Peninsula of <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a>, between <a href="Arnold%27s%20Cove">Arnold's Cove</a> and <a href="Harbour%20Main-Chapel%27s%20Cove-Lakeview">Chapel's Cove</a>. Some communities, including <a href="St.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">St. John's</a>, worked to clear debris from culverts and storm drains to minimize the effects of flooding. Outer rainbands produced up to of rain in just a few hours, which produced localized urban flooding in St. John's. Winds gusted to at <a href="Cape%20Pine">Cape Pine</a> and at Cape Race. At <a href="St.%20John%27s%20International%20Airport">St. John's International Airport</a>, sustained winds of 34 mph (54 km/h) were punctuated by gusts to . The winds briefly cut power to about 100 households in a St. John's neighborhood. Offshore, a buoy over the <a href="Laurentian%20fan">Laurentian fan</a> recorded peak wave heights to , and an oil rig southeast of the storm's center experienced sustained winds of . Low astronomical tides prevented significant coastal flooding, but a 2.6 ft (0.8 m) surge was recorded at both St. John's and <a href="Argentia">Argentia</a>. Farther west, the hurricane generated rough seas and rip currents along the Atlantic coast of <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>.

The extratropical storm complex incorporating the remnants of Gonzalo generated strong winds across the British Isles, especially over Ireland and the northern United Kingdom. Winds gusted to at <a href="Oban">Oban</a> in western Scotland, while gusts exceeding 60 mph (100 km/h) were common elsewhere. The system halted transportation throughout the region, forcing the cancellation of more than 100 flights at <a href="London%20Heathrow%20Airport">London Heathrow Airport</a>, grounding ferries, and blocking roads and railways with debris. Falling trees killed one woman near <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park, London</a>, and injured several others. In <a href="Essex">Essex</a>, the winds collapsed a <a href="jack%20%28device%29">car jack</a> supporting a van, fatally crushing a man working underneath. The storm triggered minor power outages in Scotland and Wales, with more extensive outages in northwestern Ireland after gusts as high as 70 mph (115 km/h).
Western and central Europe were also impacted by damaging winds and downpours. The coast of the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> endured high seas and gusts to 67 mph (108 km/h), uprooting trees and flooding the coastline. Rail services and flight operations were disrupted throughout the region. In Germany, gusts over 90 mph (145 km/h) were recorded at high elevations. In <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> alone, 50 vehicles were damaged by falling debris; downed trees, torn roofs, and power outages were common throughout the nation. In the Bavarian capital of <a href="Munich">Munich</a>, the storm destroyed a large tin roof measuring over 850 sq ft (80 sq m), parts of which impacted cars and fences on the ground. Damage from the incident was estimated at <a href="Euro">€</a>500,000 (US$632,500). Throughout Germany, the storm wrought €60–100 million (US$76-126.7 million) in insured losses. A woman died in a traffic accident, attributed to wet road conditions, along the <a href="Bundesstra%C3%9Fe%20303">Bundesstraße 303</a> in the <a href="Bayreuth%20%28district%29">Bayreuth district</a>. Northwesterly gales yielded a storm surge along the country's North Sea coastline, with tides running over 7 ft (2 m) above normal along the <a href="Elbe">Elbe River</a> at <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>. Neighboring Austria and Switzerland also experienced gales and power outages. A tornado touched down near <a href="Neukirchen%20an%20der%20Enknach">Neukirchen an der Enknach</a> in Austria, damaging homes and farms. Gusts in southern Switzerland reached , leading to road and rail closures. In southern France, the system initiated a <a href="Mistral%20%28wind%29">mistral wind</a> event.

The upper-level low associated with the hurricane's remnants blanketed parts of the <a href="Alps">Alps</a> with heavy snowfall, accumulating to several feet, and subsequently fueled torrential rains in the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> on October 24 and 25. Floodwaters caused by estimated rainfall totals nearing 6 in (150 mm) inundated entire villages in southeastern Bulgaria, forcing hundreds to evacuate, and there were widespread disruptions of power and water services. A woman in <a href="Burgas">Burgas</a> died from drowning. In the Greek capital city of <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, the deluge filled streets with rushing water that swept away hundreds of vehicles. More than 300 buildings were inundated in the <a href="Attica">Attica</a> area.

Hurricane Fay

Hurricane Fay was the first hurricane to make <a href="Landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> on <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> since <a href="Hurricane%20Emily%20%281987%29">Emily</a> in <a href="1987%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1987</a>. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the <a href="2014%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">2014 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, Fay evolved from a broad weather disturbance several hundred miles northeast of the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a> on October 10. Initially a <a href="subtropical%20cyclone">subtropical cyclone</a> with an expansive wind field and asymmetrical cloud field, the storm gradually attained tropical characteristics as it turned north, transitioning into a tropical storm early on October 11. Despite being plagued by disruptive <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> for most of its duration, Tropical Storm Fay steadily intensified. Veering toward the east, Fay briefly achieved <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20hurricane%20wind%20scale">Category 1</a> hurricane status while making landfall on Bermuda early on October 12. Wind shear eventually took its toll on Fay, causing the hurricane to weaken to a tropical storm later that day and degenerate into an open <a href="Trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> early on October 13.

A few <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches">tropical cyclone warnings and watches</a> were issued in anticipation of Fay's impact on Bermuda, and public schools were closed as a precaution. Despite its modest strength, Fay produced extensive damage on Bermuda. Winds gusting over 100 mph (155 km/h) clogged roadways with downed trees and utility poles, and left a majority of the island's electric customers without power. The terminal building at <a href="L.F.%20Wade%20International%20Airport">L.F. Wade International Airport</a> was flooded after the storm compromised its roof and sprinkler system. Along the coast, the storm unmoored and destroyed numerous boats. Immediately after the hurricane, 200 <a href="Bermuda%20Regiment">Bermuda Regiment</a> soldiers were called to clear debris and assist in initial damage repairs. Cleanup efforts overlapped with preparations for the approach of the stronger <a href="Hurricane%20Gonzalo">Hurricane Gonzalo</a>, which struck the island less than six days later and compounded the damage. Fay and Gonzalo marked the first recorded instance of two Bermuda hurricane landfalls in one season.

Hurricane Fay originated in a disturbance calved from a mid- to upper-level <a href="Trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> over the east-central Atlantic. On October 7, a broad region of showers and thunderstorms formed around it, possibly enhanced by moisture from a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> to the south. Tracking westward, the energy coalesced into an upper-level <a href="cold-core%20low">cold-core low</a> on the following day, and an associated trough formed at the surface. Southwesterly <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> initially hindered development, but as the system became more vertically aligned on October 9, the hostile winds calmed. In turn, a curved banding feature was able to take form. Early on October 10, satellite imagery indicated that the center of circulation had become better-defined, with a swath of deep convection to the north and west of the low. It became a subtropical storm at 06:00 <a href="Universal%20Coordinated%20Time">UTC</a> on October 10, though it was not named "Fay" until later that day, after initially being classified Subtropical Depression Seven. Its involvement with the upper-level low and wide radius of <a href="maximum%20sustained%20winds">maximum winds</a> precluded designation as a fully tropical cyclone.
Immediately after forming, the storm moved northwestward around the periphery of a <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge of high pressure</a> in the central Atlantic. As Fay moved away from its parent upper low, wind shear once again increased. The <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> originally expected the cyclone to remain weak, but Fay began organizing more quickly than anticipated. Relatively strong winds sampled by a <a href="Hurricane%20Hunters">Hurricane Hunters</a> aircraft necessitated a special off-hour advisory to raise the cyclone's intensity estimate. The storm started to acquire characteristics of a fully tropical system, and despite strong southerly wind shear preventing thunderstorms from developing near the center, Fay's wind speeds steadily increased. Upper-level <a href="Extratropical%20cyclone%23Cyclogenesis">air divergence</a> from the nearby non-tropical low may have contributed to the storm's resilience. After convection became more symmetrical and the wind field contracted, Fay transitioned into a tropical storm at 06:00 UTC on October 11. At the same time, the system turned toward the north around the central Atlantic ridge, soon gaining an easterly component to its movement. Fay remained heavily sheared, with the deepest convection still displaced from the center.

Forecasters originally believed Fay to have only briefly been a hurricane, but post-season reanalysis revealed that the system had actually strengthened into a <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20hurricane%20wind%20scale">Category 1 hurricane</a> by early on October 12 and maintained that strength for 12 hours. The upgrade was confirmed by buoy and land observations and <a href="weather%20radar">weather radar</a> data. At 08:10 UTC, the cyclone made <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> on Bermuda with <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">maximum sustained wind</a>s of 80 mph (130 km/h), the hurricane's peak intensity. Fay was the first hurricane to make landfall on the island since <a href="Hurricane%20Emily%20%281987%29">Emily</a> in <a href="1987%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1987</a>. Its satellite presentation improved as a mid-level <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye feature</a> formed, though the system remained lopsided. Fay then accelerated toward the east-northeast ahead of a <a href="shortwave%20%28meteorology%29">shortwave trough</a> to the north, which also acted to further enhance shear in the area. The hurricane finally succumbed to the persistent wind shear when the low-level center decoupled from the mid-level low and became elongated. By the early morning hours of October 13, Fay started transitioning into an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> as it entered a <a href="baroclinity">baroclinic</a> environment and ingested colder, drier air. The circulation rapidly deteriorated; consequently, the NHC issued its last operational advisory on the system at 21:00 UTC on October 12. Early the following day, the storm degenerated into an open trough, ending its existence as a tropical cyclone. Shortly after, the system became reestablished as a frontal cyclone, which lost its definition over the northeastern Atlantic on October 15.

In advance of Fay, a <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches%23Tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches">tropical storm watch</a> was issued on October 10 and upgraded to a tropical storm warning the next day. Additionally, in response to the storm's unexpected strengthening, a hurricane watch was posted at 21:00 UTC on October 11. All public schools on the island were closed for the storm. Bus and ferry services were canceled, and two cruise ships delayed their arrival into port to avoid the cyclone.
Fay produced unexpectedly strong winds across Bermuda, especially over western and southern parts of the territory. L.F. Wade International Airport reported 10-minute sustained winds of , with gusts to . Several stations at higher elevations recorded gusts in excess of , reaching at Commissioner's Point, about above sea level. The most intense winds occurred in a relatively quick burst on the backside of the storm, within a large <a href="rainband">band of thunderstorms</a> that affected the island a couple hours after the official landfall. Local radar imagery indicated possible <a href="Mesovortices%23Eyewall%20mesovortices">tornadic activity</a> coinciding with the period of most damaging winds, though this could also have been an artifact of radar velocity folding. A gauge at <a href="St.%20George%27s%2C%20Bermuda">St. George's</a> recorded a <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a>, though higher water rises may have affected the southern and western sides of the island. Rainfall unofficially amounted to as reported by a member of the public, and the airport recorded of rain, though the observing equipment was compromised in both cases.

The hurricane brought down thousands of trees and tree limbs, making streets impassable. The winds also toppled utility poles and inflicted roof damage on buildings. Over 27,000 of the Bermuda Electric Light Company's 36,000 customers lost power at the height of the storm. Several roads, including Front Street in <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Bermuda">Hamilton</a>, were flooded. Many boats up to in length broke free from their moorings and were damaged or destroyed upon being driven aground. Hamilton city parks sustained considerable damage, and were closed due to safety hazards. The combined effects of Fay and Gonzalo forced the Botanical Gardens and Arboretum to stay closed until mid-November, while cleanup of vegetation damage was underway.

Fay damaged the roof of the airport's terminal building, causing the sprinkler system to malfunction and inundate parts of the structure with water; the resultant flooding crippled computer systems crucial to processing passenger information. The airport's radar was also impacted by the storm. In response to the damage, the airport was closed to all flights, though it quickly reopened to emergency diversions and non-commercial flights. Including subsequent damage from Gonzalo, about $2 million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited as evidence of the need for a newer terminal in a more protected location.

Overall, the cyclone's effects were greater than anticipated, with destruction at least partially facilitated by saturated soils from nearly of rain in August and above-normal precipitation in September. Farmers reported that much of their autumn and winter crops had been lost, along with a few head of livestock. Fay and Gonzalo had a significant cumulative impact on Bermuda's <a href="Economy%20of%20Bermuda">agriculture and fishing</a> industries, contributing to a slight <a href="gross%20domestic%20product">GDP</a> decline. By about a week after Fay's landfall, a local insurance company had received nearly 400 claims resulting from the storm, accounting for $3.8 million in damage. However, with several insurers on the island, the actual damage total was likely much higher; in a report to the <a href="World%20Meteorological%20Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a>, the <a href="Bermuda%20Weather%20Service">Bermuda Weather Service</a> speculated that all insurance claims from Fay totaled "tens of millions of dollars". Ten people suffered minor storm-related injuries, but no fatalities were attributed to the storm.

Cleanup efforts after the storm were hastened as Hurricane Gonzalo approached from the south, amid concerns that strewn debris from Fay could become airborne and exacerbate future destruction. The unanticipated heavy damage from Fay prompted residents to prepare more thoroughly for Gonzalo, as evidenced by stores reporting an influx of customers purchasing emergency supplies. Two hundred <a href="Bermuda%20Regiment">Bermuda Regiment</a> soldiers helped clear debris and began repairing structural damage. On October 13, crews of soldiers put <a href="tarpaulin">tarpaulin</a>s on 30 homes with roof damage, as well as distributing another 150 tarps to homeowners.

Early on October 16, the Bermuda Electric Light Company (BELCO) switched its focus from service restoration after Fay to preparations for the onslaught of Gonzalo, leaving about 1,500 households without power. The remaining affected customers were asked to refrain from calling in to report outages, as further repairs would not be attempted before Gonzalo's passage unless "an easy fix can be made [and] resources are available". With the same 1,500 customers still without electricity by October 23, BELCO tasked several crews with restoring the residual Fay outages on a priority basis, aided by Caribbean Electric Utility Services Corporation linemen who arrived in the aftermath of Gonzalo. Following the two hurricanes, service was not completely restored to the island until November 3; BELCO ultimately spent $2.9 million on system repairs, having replaced 228 utility poles and over 4 mi (6.5 km) of wire.

No. 91 Wing RAAF

No. 91 (Composite) Wing was a <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) <a href="Wing%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">wing</a> that operated during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> and its immediate aftermath. It was established in October 1950 to administer RAAF units deployed in the conflict: <a href="No.%2077%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 77 (Fighter) Squadron</a>, flying <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">North American P-51 Mustang</a>s; No. 30 Communications Flight, flying <a href="Auster">Auster</a>s and <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas C-47 Dakotas</a>; <a href="No.%20391%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 391 (Base) Squadron</a>; and <a href="No.%20491%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 491 (Maintenance) Squadron</a>. The wing was headquartered at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Iwakuni">Iwakuni</a>, Japan, as were its subordinate units with the exception of No. 77 Squadron, which was based in Korea and came under the operational control of the United States <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a>.

No. 30 Communications Flight was re-designated No. 30 Communications Unit in November 1950, and <a href="No.%2030%20Transport%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 30 Transport Unit</a> a year later, before re-forming as <a href="No.%2036%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 36 (Transport) Squadron</a> in March 1953. It undertook medical evacuation, cargo and troop transport, and courier flights. No. 77 Squadron converted to <a href="Gloster%20Meteor">Gloster Meteor</a> jets between April and July 1951, and operated primarily in the ground attack role from December that year. It remained in Korea on garrison duty following the <a href="Korean%20Armistice%20Agreement">July 1953 armistice</a>, and returned to Australia in November 1954; No. 491 Squadron disbanded the same month. No. 36 Squadron returned to Australia in March 1955, leaving four aircraft to equip the newly formed <a href="RAAF%20Transport%20Flight%20%28Japan%29">RAAF Transport Flight (Japan)</a>, which briefly came under No. 91 Wing's control. The following month, No. 391 Squadron and No. 91 Wing headquarters were disbanded.

When the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> broke out on 25 June 1950, <a href="No.%2077%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 77 (Fighter) Squadron</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) was based at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Iwakuni">Iwakuni</a>, Japan. For the previous four years, equipped mainly with <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">North American P-51 Mustang</a>s, it had served with the British Commonwealth Air Group, the air component of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a> (BCOF), initially as part of <a href="No.%2081%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 81 Wing RAAF</a>. No. 81 Wing was disbanded in November 1948, leaving No. 77 Squadron as Australia's sole air unit in Japan. It was now the largest squadron in the RAAF, comprising 299 officers and men, forty Mustangs, three <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">CAC Wirraway</a>s, two <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas C-47 Dakotas</a> and two <a href="Auster">Auster</a>s. The squadron was preparing to return to Australia when it was placed on standby for action over Korea; it began flying missions as part of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> (UN) peacekeeping force a week later. No. 77 Squadron's commanding officer, <a href="Wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">Wing Commander</a> <a href="Lou%20Spence">Lou Spence</a>, was killed in action on 9 September 1950, and Air Commodore <a href="Alan%20Charlesworth">Alan Charlesworth</a>, Chief of Staff at BCOF, temporarily took charge at Iwakuni, pending the formation of an overarching organisation for support and administration at the base. <a href="Squadron%20Leader">Squadron Leader</a> <a href="Dick%20Cresswell">Dick Cresswell</a> arrived on 17 September to assume command of No. 77 Squadron.

Following the <a href="Battle%20of%20Inchon">landing at Inchon</a> and the northward advance of UN troops, No. 77 Squadron relocated to <a href="Pohang%20Airport">Pohang</a>, South Korea, on 12 October 1950. It left its main support elements at Iwakuni. No. 91 (Composite) Wing was established at the base on 20 October. The term "composite" referred to an RAAF formation made up of disparate operational elements, rather than one comprising a single type such as bombers or fighters. Commanded by <a href="Group%20Captain">Group Captain</a> A.D. (Dallas) Charlton, No. 91 Wing was given administrative responsibility for all RAAF units operating during the Korean War. As well as No. 77 Squadron, this included the newly formed <a href="No.%20391%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 391 (Base) Squadron</a> and <a href="No.%20491%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 491 (Maintenance) Squadron</a>, and No. 30 Communications Flight, formerly the No. 77 Squadron Communications Flight and initially comprising its two Dakotas and two Austers. Apart from No. 77 Squadron, the wing's units were all headquartered at Iwakuni. Some members of the US <a href="Far%20East%20Air%20Forces">Far East Air Forces</a> command favoured the establishment of a British Commonwealth Wing, to include No. 77 Squadron and the Mustang-equipped <a href="2%20Squadron%20SAAF">No. 2 Squadron</a> of the <a href="South%20African%20Air%20Force">South African Air Force</a>, then en route to Korea, but the South African government vetoed the idea.

No. 77 Squadron's tasking was controlled by the United States <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a> from the time it commenced operations in Korea, and this arrangement was not affected by the formation of No. 91 Wing. It moved forward from Pohang to <a href="Yonpo%20Airfield">Yonpo</a>, near <a href="Hamhung">Hamhung</a>, in November 1950, continuing its support of UN forces as they advanced up the peninsula. North Korea's counter-attack, augmented by Chinese forces, led to the squadron being hurriedly withdrawn to <a href="Busan">Pusan</a> on 3 December. Poor radio communications with No. 91 Wing dogged the evacuation from Yonpo, which was effected through US Air Force support supplementing the efforts of RAAF Dakotas. Cresswell believed that the Iwakuni-based wing headquarters was not always in tune with frontline requirements, and he often dealt directly with Lieutenant General <a href="Horace%20Robertson">Sir Horace Robertson</a>, BCOF commander and the theatre's senior Australian officer, and the RAAF's <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Vice Marshal <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Frederick Scherger</a>.

In response to the threat of communist <a href="Mikoyan-Gurevich%20MiG-15">Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15</a> jet fighters, No. 77 Squadron was withdrawn to Iwakuni in April 1951, to re-equip with <a href="Gloster%20Meteor">Gloster Meteor</a>s. Four <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> officers with Meteor experience were seconded to No. 91 Wing to assist with training. The squadron returned to action with its new aircraft on 29 July, operating out of <a href="Gimpo%20International%20Airport">Kimpo</a>, South Korea. The Mustangs had been highly effective in <a href="close%20air%20support">close support</a>, but No. 77 Squadron's main role in the RAAF was interception, and it was expected that with the Meteor it could again focus on fighter duties. According to the <a href="Australia%20in%20the%20Korean%20War%201950%E2%80%9353">official history of Australia in the Korean War</a>, the unit proved its value diplomatically as well as operationally: having been one of the first UN squadrons to go into action, it comprised one-third of the jet fighter force in the latter part of 1951, when clashes in "<a href="MiG%20Alley">MiG Alley</a>" were at their height. However, dogfights between Meteors and MiGs that August convinced the new commanding officer, Wing Commander <a href="Gordon%20Steege">Gordon Steege</a>, that the Australian jets were outmatched, and Fifth Air Force agreed to take them out of an offensive air-to-air combat role in favour of escort duties and local air defence. The squadron's loss rate by the end of the year was one in four killed or captured.
Beginning in December 1951 under Steege's replacement, Wing Commander Ron Susans, No. 77 Squadron again took up an offensive role, namely ground attack, which constituted its primary tasking for the rest of the war. <a href="Flight%20Lieutenant">Flight Lieutenant</a> J.C. Smith, No. 91 Wing's armament officer, played a key role in developing "Flaming Onion", <a href="napalm">napalm</a>-tipped air-to-ground rockets that were used in several operations in 1952 and 1953. No. 77 Squadron remained in Korea on garrison duty—initially at Kimpo, later at <a href="Kunsan%20Air%20Base">Kunsan</a>—following the <a href="Korean%20Armistice%20Agreement">armistice</a> in July 1953. It had lost forty-one pilots killed during the war. A further seven pilots became prisoners of war. Aircraft losses totalled almost sixty, including over forty Meteors, mostly to ground fire. The squadron flew 18,872 sorties, including 3,872 in Mustangs and 15,000 in Meteors. It was credited with shooting down five MiG-15s and destroying 3,700 buildings, 1,408 vehicles, ninety-eight locomotives and carriages, and sixteen bridges.

No. 30 Communications Flight included Robertson's personal Dakota, operating under his direction. The unit's complement of two Dakotas and two Austers was soon augmented by two more Dakotas from Australia. On 1 November 1950, No. 30 Communications Flight was renamed <a href="No.%2030%20Communications%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 30 Communications Unit</a>. The same month, it received another four Dakotas from <a href="No.%2038%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 38 Squadron</a>, of <a href="No.%2090%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 90 (Composite) Wing</a> in <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malaya</a>, giving it a strength of eight Dakotas and two Austers. The unit supported all Australian forces in Korea. One of its key functions was medical evacuation, but it was also responsible for supply drops, search and rescue, reconnaissance, and mail delivery, as well as transporting cargo, troops, and VIPs. Unlike No. 77 Squadron, it was not tasked by Fifth Air Force but instead operated under Australian control, which was exercised through BCOF headquarters in Japan. No. 30 Communications Unit was re-formed as <a href="No.%2030%20Transport%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 30 Transport Unit</a> on 5 November 1951, and as <a href="No.%2036%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 36 (Transport) Squadron</a> on 10 March 1953. During the war it transported around 100,000 passengers and over 6,000 tons of cargo. No. 91 Wing's records listed 12,762 medical evacuations from Korea to Japan, and over 2,000 from Japan to Australia or Britain. The transportation unit lost an Auster and a Wirraway to crashes, resulting in four deaths.

When the Korean War broke out, No. 77 Squadron was self-supporting. The added burden of combat operations made this situation untenable after the squadron went into action in Korea, leading to the formation of No. 391 (Base) Squadron at Iwakuni, at the same time as No. 91 Wing headquarters. RAAF base squadrons were responsible for administrative, logistical, medical, communications and security functions. Staffed mainly by former No. 77 Squadron members, in the first year of its existence No. 391 Squadron had to contend with severe shortages of winter clothing and equipment. Further problems arose following the introduction of the Meteor, as spares for the British-made jet were harder to obtain than for the American Mustang. Along with its RAAF responsibilities, No. 391 Squadron supported <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> and other UN personnel travelling through Iwakuni. It ran No. 91 Wing's "Transit Hotel", which accommodated business people and entertainers, as well as military personnel. The squadron's medical contingent was heavily engaged in the preparation and escort of injured personnel from Korea to Iwakuni and then to other destinations.

No. 491 Squadron was also formed in tandem with No. 91 Wing on 20 October 1950. Headquartered at Iwakuni, it was responsible for all maintenance of the wing's aircraft except day-to-day servicing. A section was attached to No. 77 Squadron in South Korea to assist ground staff with daily maintenance. Personnel from Iwakuni were regularly rotated through this section, and augmented by additional No. 491 Squadron staff as needed for repair or salvage work. The standard RAAF working days for technicians at Iwakuni contrasted with shifts of up to sixteen hours near the front line in Korea. Korea was one of the coldest climates in which RAAF ground crews had ever worked; Squadron Leader Cresswell recalled seeing maintenance staff with tools frozen to their hands. Both Nos. 391 and 491 Squadrons used Japanese technicians as well as Australian, which was unusual for the time; during the <a href="occupation%20of%20Japan">occupation of Japan</a> following its surrender in World War II, the RAAF had only employed Japanese workers for menial tasks.

No. 77 Squadron stood down at Kunsan on 7 October 1954 and flew its Meteors to Iwakuni five days later. It departed for Australia in November and became operational again at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Williamtown">RAAF Base Williamtown</a>, New South Wales, on 4 January 1955. Its eleven-year absence from Australia, beginning in the Pacific during World War II and continuing in Japan as part of BCOF, was a record for an RAAF unit. No. 491 Squadron disbanded at Iwakuni on 13 December 1954. No. 36 Squadron ceased flying on 13 March 1955 and returned to Australia, leaving behind three Dakotas and a Wirraway that equipped <a href="RAAF%20Transport%20Flight%20%28Japan%29">RAAF Transport Flight (Japan)</a>, formed the following day under No. 91 Wing. No. 391 Squadron and No. 91 Wing headquarters were disbanded at Iwakuni on 30 April 1955. Transport Flight (Japan) flew a courier service to South Korea and remained operational until 8 July 1956, when its last Dakota—the last RAAF aircraft in Japan—departed Iwakuni.

No. 91 Wing was commanded by the following officers:

Operation Pamphlet

Operation Pamphlet, also called Convoy Pamphlet, was a <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> <a href="Convoy%23World%20War%20II">convoy</a> operation conducted during January and February 1943 to transport the <a href="9th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">9th Australian Division</a> home from <a href="Egypt%20during%20World%20War%20II%23Allied%20victory">Egypt</a>. The convoy involved five transports, which were protected from <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Japanese warships</a> by several <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> naval task forces during the trip across the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> and along the Australian coast. The division embarked in late January 1943 and the convoy operation began on 4 February. No contact was made between Allied and Japanese ships, and the division arrived in Australian ports during late February with no losses from enemy action.

The operation came after the British and United States governments agreed to an Australian government request that the 9th Division be returned home, and ended the role of the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a> in the <a href="Western%20Desert%20Campaign">Western Desert Campaign</a>. This followed a lengthy debate between the respective national leaders, with <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> and <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> attempting to convince the Australian Prime Minister <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a> to withdraw his request until the Allied victory in <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North Africa</a> was complete. Curtin was unwilling to delay, as he and the Allied military leaders in the South West Pacific believed that the veteran division was needed to bolster the forces for <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">offensive operations in New Guinea</a>.

A convoy to return the 9th Australian Division to Australia was assembled in the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a> near <a href="Massawa">Massawa</a> from late January to early February 1943. The ships began their voyage across the Indian Ocean on 4 February, refuelled at <a href="Addu%20Atoll">Addu Atoll</a>, and arrived safely at the <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australian</a> port of <a href="Fremantle">Fremantle</a> on 18 February. Four transports continued to the Australian east coast, one docking at <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> on 25 February and the remainder arriving at <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> two days later. After its return to Australia, the division made an important contribution to operations in New Guinea in late 1943.

During 1940 and 1941, three infantry divisions and other units assigned to <a href="I%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">I Corps</a> of the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) were transported to the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Middle East</a>, where they took part in several campaigns against German, Italian and <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy French</a> forces. Following the outbreak of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>, the corps headquarters and the <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">6th</a> and <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">7th Divisions</a> were returned to Australia in early 1942 to reinforce the defence of Australia in <a href="Operation%20Stepsister">Operation Stepsister</a>. The Australian Government agreed to British and United States requests temporarily to retain the 9th Australian Division in the Middle East in exchange for the deployment of more <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> units to Australia and British support for a proposal to expand the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> to 73 flying <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadrons</a>. The 9th Division played an important role in the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">First Battle of El Alamein</a> during July 1942 and the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">Second Battle of El Alamein</a> between 23 October and 4 November. The division suffered many casualties during the latter engagement and did not take part in the pursuit of the Axis retreat.

Several factors influenced the decision made by the Australian Government in October 1942 to recall the 9th Division to Australia. Most importantly, the Government and the commander of the <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">Australian Military Forces</a>, General <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Thomas Blamey</a>, wanted to relieve the 6th and 7th Divisions from combat in the <a href="New%20Guinea%20Campaign">New Guinea Campaign</a> and Blamey considered the 9th Division to be better prepared for this responsibility than the Australian Army's <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">militia</a> forces or US Army units. The commander of Allied forces in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">South West Pacific Area</a>, General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>, had also been pressing the US and Australian Governments for reinforcements to conduct offensive operations against Japanese positions. Other factors influencing the Australian Government's decision were a desire to concentrate the Australian Army in a single theatre, the increasing difficulty of finding replacements for the 9th Division's casualties given the Army's manpower shortages, the political difficulties associated with implementing reforms to permit militia units to serve outside Australian territory, and concerns that a prolonged absence from Australia would affect morale among the 9th Division's soldiers.

On 17 October 1942, Australian Prime Minister <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a> <a href="Diplomatic%20cable">cabled</a> British Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> to request that the 9th Division be returned to Australia. In the cable Curtin stated that, owing to Australia's manpower shortage and the demands of the war in the Pacific, it was no longer possible to provide enough reinforcements to sustain the division in the Middle East. The British Government initially resisted this request on the grounds that the 9th Division was required for the upcoming offensive at El Alamein. On 29 October (six days into the battle) Curtin again cabled Churchill, stating that Australia needed the division in the Pacific and in a fit state to participate in offensive operations. On 1 November, US President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> wrote to Curtin proposing to send another US Army division to Australia if the Australian Government agreed to retain the 9th Division in the Middle East. Curtin, acting on the advice of MacArthur, responded to Roosevelt on 16 November rejecting this suggestion, and again requested that the 9th Division be returned.

On 21 November, the commander of the 9th Division, Major General <a href="Leslie%20Morshead">Leslie Morshead</a>, was informed by General <a href="Harold%20Alexander%2C%201st%20Earl%20Alexander%20of%20Tunis">Harold Alexander</a>, the commander-in-chief of the <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">Middle East Command</a>, that a decision had been made to return the division to Australia. Churchill told the Australian Government on 2 December that while he was prepared to recommend to Roosevelt that the 9th Division be returned, the resultant diversion of shipping would reduce the size of the build-up of United States military forces in Britain and North Africa by 30,000 men. In the same cable, Churchill also stated that due to a shortage of shipping the 9th Division's heavy equipment would need to remain in the Middle East. On 3 December, Roosevelt again wrote to Curtin to suggest that the 9th Division remain in the Middle East until the final defeat of the Axis forces in North Africa. Roosevelt also informed Curtin that the US Army's <a href="25th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">25th Infantry Division</a> would be transferred to Australia during December. Following these messages the Australian Government sought advice from Blamey and MacArthur on whether it was necessary for the 9th Division to return with its heavy equipment, and was informed that the necessary supplies could be sourced from American resources once the unit arrived in Australia.

Curtin replied to Churchill and Roosevelt on 8 December, and again stressed the need to return the 9th Division to Australia as soon as possible to make good the Army's losses to tropical diseases and prepare for future offensives in the Pacific. In his message he agreed to leave the division's heavy equipment in the Middle East, and requested only that it travel with items necessary to quickly re-enter combat in the South West Pacific. No further debate took place, and on 15 December Churchill informed Curtin that shipping would be made available in late January to transport the division and a small portion of its equipment to Australia.

The 9th Division's role in the Second Battle of El Alamein ended on 5 November 1942. From 30 November the division travelled to Palestine by road, and all its units arrived there by 9 December. After settling into camps located between <a href="Gaza%20City">Gaza</a> and <a href="Qastina">Qastina</a>, the 9th Division undertook a period of rebuilding and training, and many soldiers were granted leave. On 22 December, a formal <a href="Military%20parade">parade</a> involving the entire division was conducted at Gaza Airport.

Preparations to return the 9th Division to Australia began in late December 1942. On 26 December, all of the AIF unit commanding officers in the Middle East were informed that their commands were to return to Australia; the movement was code-named "Liddington". Tight security was instituted, and more junior personnel who needed to be informed were told that their units were being transferred to Egypt. Many members of the AIF initially believed that they would take part in further fighting in the Mediterranean, but as preparations continued it became obvious that the units were about to undertake a long sea voyage. The 9th Division's artillery, tanks and other heavy equipment were transferred to ordnance depots during early January 1943, and on the 16th of that month the division began moving to the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> area, from where it was to embark. During this period all of the personnel assigned to the AIF Reinforcement Depot in Palestine were transferred to the 9th Division, resulting in the formation being larger than its authorised strength. The movement of the 9th Division took place in groups, each of which spent one or two days at a transit camp at Qassin, where all vehicles were handed to British authorities. The 9th Division also began training for <a href="Jungle%20warfare">jungle</a> and <a href="amphibious%20warfare">amphibious warfare</a> before departing the Middle East. During January, each brigade spent three days exercising in the rough terrain near <a href="Bayt%20Jibrin">Bayt Jibrin</a>, which was believed to be the nearest equivalent to a jungle in Palestine. Most of the brigade commanders and several officers from each of the infantry battalions also attended short courses at the British amphibious warfare school on the <a href="Great%20Bitter%20Lake">Bitter Lakes</a> in Egypt.

The <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> also made preparations in late 1942 for the movement of the 9th Division back to Australia. Four large troop ships were allocated to the task, and the British <a href="Chiefs%20of%20Staff%20Committee">Chiefs of Staff Committee</a> initially proposed to Churchill that they sail across the Indian Ocean without a protective escort. However, as the eastern Indian Ocean was within range of Japanese warships based at <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Singapore">Singapore</a> and Japanese submarines had occasionally attacked ships near <a href="Aden">Aden</a>, this was judged to be unacceptably risky, especially as it was not likely that the movement of so many soldiers could be kept secret. Moreover, transporting the division without an escort would have violated the long-standing policy of assigning at least one <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a> to protect troop convoys in this region, and would not have been accepted by the Australian government. In November, the Chiefs of Staff Committee decided to allocate an escort to the convoy, but did not specify what it should comprise.

The ships assigned to carry the 9th Division to Australia were the converted ocean liners <a href="RMS%20Aquitania">"Aquitania"</a>, <a href="SS%20%C3%8Ele%20de%20France">"Île de France"</a>, <a href="SS%20Nieuw%20Amsterdam%20%281937%29">"Nieuw Amsterdam"</a> and <a href="RMS%20Queen%20Mary">"Queen Mary"</a>; these four large vessels had previously carried Australian soldiers to the Middle East and other locations. The liners were heavily tasked transporting Allied military personnel across long distances, and arrived at Suez individually. "Aquitania" put in from Australia on 5 January, "Queen Mary" was reassigned from transporting American personnel across the Atlantic and arrived from the United Kingdom on 18 January, "Nieuw Amsterdam" completed one of her frequent voyages along the coast of <a href="East%20Africa">East Africa</a> on 31 January and "Île de France" arrived in late January. In addition to the four converted liners, the <a href="armed%20merchant%20cruiser">armed merchant cruiser</a> <a href="SS%20Queen%20of%20Bermuda">HMS "Queen of Bermuda"</a> was transferred from transport duties in the Indian Ocean to both augment the convoy's escort and embark Australian personnel. The four liners were armed with anti-aircraft guns manned by dedicated personnel, as well as two 6-inch guns each. The operation to sail these vessels from Egypt to Australia together was designated Operation Pamphlet.

The AIF began embarking on the troop ships on 24 January 1943. As the Suez Canal ports were too small for the four troop ships to load simultaneously, the embarkation process was staged and the convoy's five vessels sailed separately through the northern Red Sea and rendezvoused near <a href="Massawa">Massawa</a> in <a href="Eritrea%20Governorate">Eritrea</a>. British <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s , , and and the Greek destroyer <a href="Greek%20destroyer%20Vasilissa%20Olga%20%28D15%29">"Vasilissa Olga"</a> were transferred from the <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet">Mediterranean Fleet</a> to guard the troop ships from attack by Japanese submarines as they passed through the Red Sea.
"Queen Mary" was the first ship to complete loading, and left <a href="Suez%20Port">Port Tewfik</a> on 25 January. She anchored at Massawa three days later, and the soldiers on board endured very hot conditions until she resumed her journey. "Aquitania" was next to load, and embarked the entire <a href="20th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">20th Brigade</a> between 25 and 30 January. "Île de France" completed loading and departed Egypt on 28 January, and "Nieuw Amsterdam" and "Queen of Bermuda" sailed together on 1 February. Overall, 30,985 Australians were embarked on "Queen of Bermuda" and the converted liners; "Aquitania" carried 6,953, "Île de France" 6,531, "Nieuw Amsterdam" had 9,241 on board, 9,995 sailed on "Queen Mary" and 1,731 on "Queen of Bermuda". A total of 622 AIF personnel remained in the Middle East after the ships departed Egypt, but this figure was steadily reduced to below 20 by March 1943.

The five ships of the convoy rendezvoused off the Red Sea island of <a href="Perim">Perim</a> on the morning of 4 February, and passed Aden later that day. The destroyers left the convoy as it passed <a href="Cape%20Guardafui">Cape Guardafui</a>, and were replaced by the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> and <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> , which were to serve as ocean escorts. Captain <a href="James%20Gordon%20Partridge%20Bisset">James Bisset</a>, commander of the "Queen Mary", served as the <a href="convoy%20commodore">convoy commodore</a>. The four large converted liners sailed in line abreast formation and "Queen of Bermuda"s position varied based on the time of day and the situation. The convoy travelled at a speed of ; while the liners typically sailed at much higher speeds during their independent voyages, they were constrained by the maximum that "Queen of Bermuda" could maintain. Bisset was frustrated by the decision to sail the transports together, as it considerably increased the time taken to complete the voyage and entailed lengthy delays for the heavily tasked "Queen Mary".

After entering the Indian Ocean, the convoy sailed south-east. The ships manoeuvred together in a <a href="zigzag">zigzag</a> course; avoiding collisions during the frequent turns placed heavy demands on the watch-keeping officers, who found their shifts exhausting. The troops endured very uncomfortable conditions on the hot and crowded ships, but morale was high. They entertained themselves with sports, <a href="sun%20baking">sun baking</a> and gambling, and those on "Queen Mary" could attend concerts performed by a regimental brass band. The 9th Division's officers enjoyed somewhat better conditions, which frustrated some of the <a href="Other%20ranks%20%28UK%29">other ranks</a>. The 9th Division's preparations for jungle warfare continued during the voyage, with all personnel attending daily lectures delivered by officers on the lessons learnt during the previous fighting in the Pacific.

The convoy arrived at <a href="Addu%20Atoll">Addu Atoll</a> on the evening of 9 February, and anchored there to refuel and take on supplies. This atoll served as a secret supply base for Allied vessels in the Indian Ocean, and the Australian soldiers were not told where they were while the refuelling took place. The troops were also not permitted to go ashore, but regarded the sight of the tropical atoll as a welcome change from the arid Middle East. After the ships were refuelled, the convoy sailed on the afternoon of 10 February.

A strong escort force was provided to guard the convoy as it travelled through the eastern Indian Ocean. This was considered the most dangerous stage of the voyage, as the convoy would pass within range of the Japanese warships based at Singapore. To counter this threat, the convoy's escort was reinforced for several days by <a href="Force%20A">Force A</a> of the British <a href="Eastern%20Fleet">Eastern Fleet</a>. This force comprised the <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s , and , as well as the light cruiser and six destroyers. Force A sailed within view of the transports on 10 February to provide reassurance to the Australian soldiers, and subsequently patrolled over the horizon from the convoy. When the convoy reached a point from the Western Australian port of <a href="Fremantle">Fremantle</a> its escort was reinforced by the Dutch cruisers <a href="HNLMS%20Jacob%20van%20Heemskerck%20%281939%29">HNLMS "Jacob van Heemskerck"</a> and <a href="HNLMS%20Tromp%20%281937%29">"Tromp"</a>, as well as the destroyers <a href="HNLMS%20Tjerk%20Hiddes%20%28G16%29">HNLMS "Tjerk Hiddes"</a> and <a href="HNLMS%20Van%20Galen%20%28G84%29">"Van Galen"</a>.

The ships arrived at Fremantle on 18 February. The sight of the Australian coast had been eagerly anticipated by the soldiers, who broke into cheers when it became visible shortly before noon that day. "Nieuw Amsterdam" and "Queen of Bermuda" berthed in Fremantle Harbour, and the other three troop ships dropped anchor at <a href="Gage%20Roads">Gage Roads</a>. The Western Australian members of the 9th Division disembarked, and the ships loaded supplies and mail. As "Queen of Bermuda" left the convoy at Fremantle, her remaining 517 passengers were transferred to "Nieuw Amsterdam". This resulted in considerable overcrowding for the remainder of the liner's voyage.

The Australian Government was concerned that the troop ships could be attacked while passing through Australian waters. At a meeting held on 17 February, the <a href="Advisory%20War%20Council%20%28Australia%29">Advisory War Council</a> considered adopting a recommendation that the soldiers be moved to the east coast by rail. It decided against doing so after being informed that, due to the limited capacity of the <a href="Trans-Australian%20Railway">Trans-Australian Railway</a>, it would take several months to move the 30,000 personnel. Instead, the council recommended that the convoy continue but be given "the maximum protection possible". Due to the presence of <a href="Axis%20naval%20activity%20in%20Australian%20waters">Japanese submarines off the Australian coast</a>, tight security measures were instituted after the convoy arrived at Fremantle; civilian communications between Western Australia and the east coast were cut for several days, and Curtin asked the media to not report the movement of the 9th Division. During a confidential briefing on 24 February, Curtin told journalists that he had not slept well for three weeks due to concerns over the convoy's safety.

When the convoy sailed from Fremantle on 20 February it was escorted by the Australian light cruiser , as well as "Jacob van Heemskerck" and "Tjerk Hiddes". To avoid any enemy ships or submarines operating off the Australian coast, the convoy's route took it well to the south of the continent. The escort force was strengthened on 24 February when the convoy rendezvoused with <a href="Task%20Force%2044">Task Group 44.3</a>; this force comprised the heavy cruiser and American destroyers , and , and had been dispatched from <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> on 17 February. "Adelaide" and the Dutch warships left the convoy shortly afterwards to escort "Nieuw Amsterdam" into Melbourne; the liner docked there on the afternoon of 25 February. Task Group 44.3 escorted the remaining ships to Sydney, sailing south of <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> before proceeding up the east coast. The escort was strengthened by "Jacob van Heemskerck" and the French destroyer as the convoy passed the eastern end of the <a href="Bass%20Strait">Bass Strait</a>. The three converted liners arrived at Sydney on 27 February 1943, completing Operation Pamphlet without loss. 

Despite the official secrecy concerning the convoy, large crowds assembled on vantage points around <a href="Sydney%20Harbour">Sydney Harbour</a> to watch the ships arrive. "Queen Mary" anchored off <a href="Bradleys%20Head">Bradleys Head</a> and the other two liners berthed at <a href="Woolloomooloo">Woolloomooloo</a>. Curtin officially announced that the 9th Division had returned to Australia in a speech delivered to the <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> on 23 March.

The ships involved in Operation Pamphlet rapidly departed for other duties. After unloading her troops at Fremantle, "Queen of Bermuda" left for the United Kingdom on 3 March and arrived there on 13 April. "Nieuw Amsterdam" sailed from Melbourne bound for <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> via New Zealand on 6 March carrying 2,189 Allied military personnel; she completed her voyage on 22 March. After embarking 350 <a href="Free%20French">Free French</a> personnel and approximately 150 women and children, "Île de France" departed Sydney for <a href="Durban">Durban</a> on 16 March. On 22 March, "Queen Mary" sailed for the United Kingdom carrying 8,326 US military personnel. Travelling at , she arrived at <a href="Gourock">Gourock</a> in Scotland exactly one month later. "Aquitania" left Sydney at around the same time as "Queen Mary", and completed her voyage to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> on 4 May.

After arriving in Australia, all members of the 9th Division were given three weeks leave. The men were then assembled in their home state capital and took part in a welcome-home march; these marches were conducted both to acknowledge the division's service in the Middle East and advertise a <a href="War%20bond">war loan</a> drive. Following the marches the division re-assembled at training camps on the <a href="Atherton%20Tableland">Atherton Tableland</a> in far North Queensland, where it was to complete its training for jungle warfare. As the division was still overstrength due to the reinforcements which had been assigned to it before departing the Middle East, its excess personnel were transferred to other AIF units. The 9th Division next saw action against Japanese forces during the <a href="Salamaua%E2%80%93Lae%20campaign">Salamaua–Lae campaign</a> in New Guinea during September 1943; had the division not returned from the Middle East, at least part of this task would have fallen to less-experienced militia units.

Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata (van Eyck)

Saint Francis of Assisi Receiving the Stigmata is the name given to two unsigned paintings completed around 1428–32 that art historians usually attribute to the <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Flemish artist</a>, <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a>. The panels are nearly identical, apart from a considerable difference in size. Both are small paintings: the larger measures 29.3 cm x 33.4 cm and is in the <a href="Sabauda%20Gallery">Sabauda Gallery</a> in <a href="Turin">Turin</a>, Italy; the smaller panel is 12.7 cm x 14.6 cm and in the <a href="Philadelphia%20Museum%20of%20Art">Philadelphia Museum of Art</a>. The earliest documentary evidence is in the 1470 inventory of Anselme Adornes of <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a>'s will; he may have owned both panels. From the 19th to mid-20th centuries, most scholars attributed them either to a pupil or follower of van Eyck's working from a <a href="underdrawing">design</a> by the master.

The paintings show a famous incident from the life of <a href="Francis%20of%20Assisi">Saint Francis of Assisi</a>, who is shown kneeling by a rock as he receives the <a href="stigmata">stigmata</a> of the crucified Christ on the <a href="Five%20Holy%20Wounds">palms of his hands and soles of his feet</a>. Behind him are rock formations, shown in great detail, and a panoramic landscape that seems to relegate the figures to secondary importance. This treatment of Francis is the first such to appear in <a href="Northern%20Renaissance">northern Renaissance art</a>. The arguments attributing the works to van Eyck are circumstantial and based mainly on the style and quality of the panels. A later, third version is in the <a href="Museo%20del%20Prado">Museo del Prado</a> in Madrid, but is weaker and strays significantly in tone and design.

Between 1983 and 1989 the paintings underwent technical examination and were extensively restored and cleaned. Technical analysis of the Philadelphia painting established that the wood panel comes from the same tree as that of two paintings definitively attributed to van Eyck, and that the Italian panel has underdrawings of a quality that it is thought could only have come from him. After nearly 500 years, the paintings were reunited in 1998 in an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Today the consensus is that both were painted by the same hand.

The paintings may have belonged to the Adornes family of Bruges. A copy of a will written in 1470 by Anselme Adornes, a member of one of the leading families in Bruges, was found in 1860. As he left for pilgrimage to Jerusalem, Adornes bequeathed to his two daughters in convents two paintings he describes as by van Eyck. He described one as "with a portrait of St Francis, made by the hand of Jan van Eyck", (""een tavereele daerinne dat Sint-Franssen in portrature van meester Ians handt van Heyck ghemaect staet"").
Anselme may have inherited the paintings from his father Pieter or uncle Jakob, who had travelled to Jerusalem on pilgrimage about 50 years earlier, returning to Ghent around 1427 or 1428. On their return the Adornes brothers funded a replica of Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre built in Bruges, known as the Jerusalem chapel. They may also have commissioned the two St Francis paintings as commemoration of the pilgrimage, in the fashion of the Eyckian "<a href="The%20Three%20Marys%20at%20the%20Tomb">The Three Marys at the Tomb</a>" – attributed to Jan's brother Hubert – a painting which may have been commissioned to commemorate a successful pilgrimage. An alternative theory is that they had the small painting prepared as a portable devotional work to bring on pilgrimage. The ownership of private devotional pieces was not uncommon – the often itinerant <a href="Philip%20the%20Good">Philip the Good</a> kept an altarpiece for travelling. Even more intriguing is that Philip had van Eyck paint two identical <a href="Portrait%20of%20Isabella%20of%20Portugal%20%28van%20Eyck%29">betrothal portraits</a> of <a href="Isabella%20of%20Portugal%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Burgundy">Isabella of Portugal</a> in 1428 – to ensure one survived the trip from Portugal – which may have set a precedent that Bruges art patrons sought to emulate. Anselme Adornes almost certainly brought the smaller painting with him on pilgrimage in 1470; it was seen in Italy, particularly in Florence, and widely copied. In the early 1470s <a href="Sandro%20Botticelli">Sandro Botticelli</a>, <a href="Verrochio">Verrochio</a>, <a href="Filippino%20Lippi">Filippino Lippi</a> and <a href="Giovanni%20Bellini">Giovanni Bellini</a> each produced variations of "St Francis Receiving the Stigmata" that included motifs from van Eyck's version, especially evident in the rendering of the rocky background.

The paintings fell into obscurity for centuries until 1886 when art historian <a href="William%20Henry%20James%20Weale">W. H. J. Weale</a> drew the connection between them and the Adornes will. <a href="William%20%C3%A0%20Court%2C%201st%20Baron%20Heytesbury">William à Court, 1st Baron Heytesbury</a> bought the Philadelphia painting sometime between 1824 and 1828 in <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>. At that time it was thought to be by <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a>, but in 1857 the art historian <a href="Gustav%20Friedrich%20Waagen">Gustav Waagen</a> attributed it to van Eyck. Heytesbury sold it to a dealer in November 1894; a month later the Philadelphia collector <a href="John%20G.%20Johnson">John G. Johnson</a> bought it for £700. In 1917, he bequeathed his art collection to the City of Philadelphia.

The Turin painting was acquired in 1866 from the mayor of a nearby town. Previously it was owned by a professor living in the <a href="province%20of%20Alessandria">province of Alessandria</a>; he bought it from a former nun in that province. The documentation is sketchy, but suggests the nun possessed it early in the 19th century during the dissolution of convents in the area under <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>. That a nun owned the painting three centuries after Adornes purportedly bequeathed a van Eyck "St Francis" to his daughter in a convent, and that the Adornes family owned property in Alessandria, is suggestive, but no evidence exists to confirm a connection.

The technical investigations Butler conducted during her tenure resulted in worldwide collaborations and three publications. The culmination of the research came in 1998 with an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The exhibition was small, with a handful of paintings and a few manuscript leaves. Only two are definitively attributed to the master, the "<a href="Annunciation%20%28van%20Eyck%2C%20Washington%29">Annunciation</a>", which came from the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Art">National Gallery of Art</a> in Washington, D.C., and "<a href="Saint%20Barbara%20%28van%20Eyck%29">Saint Barbara</a>", loaned from Antwerp. Two "<a href="Saint%20Christopher%20%28after%20van%20Eyck%29">Saint Christopher</a>"'s, one in Philadelphia and the other from the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a>, are considered to be by workshop members. From Cleveland came a "John the Baptist in the Landscape", thought to be by van Eyck followers. The Philadelphia and Turin Saint Francis paintings were both on display, reunited for probably the first time since the 15th century.

The small Philadelphia panel is painted with oil on parchment (<a href="vellum">vellum</a>); a reconstructed red <a href="vermilion">vermilion</a> border surrounds the image – it is similar to those seen in contemporary <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a>s. It gives the illusion of the viewer looking through a window into the landscape. The parchment measures ; the image measures . Underneath are five wood supports; the parchment is glued to one, and four smaller pieces, added at a later date, frame the image. The parchment is unusually thick and has a thin insoluble layer of primer. The wooden frames were primed in a thick layer of white, which overlaps the parchment in places. The borders were gilded at some time; technical analysis found particles of <a href="gold%20leaf">gold leaf</a> on the lower border. The Turin panel is painted on two oak panels joined with a band of parchment or cloth, on a ground of <a href="chalk">chalk</a> and <a href="animal%20glue">animal glue</a>.

In both paintings, <a href="Francis%20of%20Assisi">Saint Francis of Assisi</a> kneels by a rock as he receives the stigmata that were to stay on his body until his death. The composition is tonally similar to <a href="Giotto">Giotto</a>'s 1295–1300 "<a href="Saint%20Francis%20Receiving%20the%20Stigmata%20%28Giotto%29">Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata</a>", but more grounded in earthly reality. The design is a mostly faithful representation of the original Franciscan texts, but differs in that Francis does not lean forward towards Christ.
Francis has individualized features, to the point that the attention to his face gives it the quality of a portrait such as van Eyck's c. 1431 "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Cardinal%20Niccol%C3%B2%20Albergati">Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati</a>". The head and face are minutely detailed. Francis is in his mid-thirties, wears stubble and has a somewhat jowly face and receding hairline. He is presented as a highly intelligent but perhaps detached and impassive individual. He is given a complex and inscrutable expression; physiological traits not uncommon in contemporary Flemish painting. He kneels on a bed of flowers, and his heavy robe and folded drapery have a choppy and overflowing feel. His lower limbs seem disconnected, positioned in an anti-naturalistic manner; giving the impression that he is levitating.

<a href="Till-Holger%20Borchert">Till-Holger Borchert</a> observes that Francis's feet are positioned slightly too high above the rest of his body, making them "so bizarrely placed as to look like a foreign body". Others have taken this as an indication of a less experienced and weaker workshop painter, but Borchert draws a similarity to two works accepted as van Eyck originals. In the "Adoration of the Mystic Lamb of God" panel of the c. 1432 "<a href="Ghent%20Altarpiece">Ghent Altarpiece</a>", the prophets kneel in a similar way with their feet placed awkwardly behind them. <a href="Nicolas%20Rolin">The donor</a> in the c. 1435 "<a href="Madonna%20of%20Chancellor%20Rolin">Madonna of Chancellor Rolin</a>" is in a similar pose, although his feet are not visible. While some critics view the positioning of Francis's feet as a weakness, <a href="Joseph%20Rishel">Joseph Rishel</a> of the Philadelphia Museum of Art argues that the contortion is necessary to show both wounds, and that the unusual positioning adds to the mystical tone of the painting.

The wounds on Francis's hands and feet are realistically portrayed; the cuts are not overly deep or dramatic and lack supernatural elements such as beams of light. The representation of Christ in the guise of a <a href="Seraph">Seraph</a> with three pairs of wings, is an unusually fantastical element for van Eyck's normally reserved sensibility. A number of art historians have addressed this disconnect and noted that Francis looks straight ahead and is unconcerned with the apparition. Holland Cotter described this disconnect as appearing as if Christ's "mystical vision were somehow aural rather than visual experience, and [Francis] was holding himself absolutely still to catch its distant sound".

Francis's disciple, secretary and confessor <a href="Brother%20Leo">Brother Leo</a> acts as eyewitness. He is dressed in sombre colours and rendered in a more compact manner than Francis; crouched as if sunk into the pictorial space in the far right of the panel. His form is highly geometric and voluminous. His cord belt curves down to end next to that of Francis, symbolising the continuity between the Order's founder and his successors. Leo's posture seems to indicate mourning, although he appears to be resting or asleep.

Nature is a key aspect in van Eyck's works. According to Rishel, elements of his landscapes may appear "magically beautiful but [are] in fact quite oblivious to the sacred action in the foreground". Katherine Luber believes that open vistas and lowered horizons are a hallmark. The Francis paintings seem to be early experiments with landscape; the painter places rocks in the mid-ground, solving the problem of how to transition from foreground to background; a similar resolution is found in the lower-right wing of the "Ghent Altarpiece".

The browns of the rocks and trees echo those of the robes of the saints. The broad sweep of the mountains and city isolates the figures against the grandeur of nature and bustling human life. Behind the figures a panoramic mountain landscape soars to the sky; the mid-ground contains a variety of rocks and spikes, including <a href="stratum">strata</a> of <a href="fossil">fossil</a>iferous layers. As with the New York "<a href="Crucifixion%20and%20Last%20Judgement%20diptych">Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych</a>", the mountains are capped with snow, which van Eyck may have seen during his visits to Italy and Spain, where he crossed the <a href="Alps">Alps</a> and <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>.

The paintings contain a number of highly detailed rock formations. Despite the early to mid-15th century date, the <a href="Conservation%20%28cultural%20heritage%29">conservator</a> Kenneth Bé observes that, to modern geologists "the details, colors, textures, and morphologies in Van Eyck's rendering of rocks yield a plethora of scientifically accurate information". He identifies four distinct rock types. Those in the right foreground are heavily weathered <a href="limestone">limestone</a> boulders. There are a number of identifiable shell <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s, painted in a dark reddish brown suggesting iron or dark coloured mineral impurities. Behind them is a stratified <a href="sedimentary">sedimentary</a> sequence. The mid-ground contains <a href="igneous%20rock">igneous rock</a>, the far distance a pair of jagged peaks.
Specialists from both art history and geology have remarked on the level of observed and precise detail found in the background. The mid-ground contains a boulder with a crescent-shaped form that could only have arisen from the rock face "intersecting the fossils to reveal cross sections of the shells in side profile", according to Bé. Another boulder has closed loops. The fossilised shells are in a pattern that suggest that some of the boulders have been upturned from their original orientation. The fossils are a type of mollusk similar either to present-day <a href="bivalvia">bivalvia</a> or <a href="brachiopods">brachiopods</a>.

The landscape shows a fictive Flemish city. As in the diptych in New York, some buildings and landmarks can be identified with Jerusalem. It closely resembles the background of the Rolin panel, which has undergone much deeper attention from scholars, with a number of identifications made with structures in Jerusalem, including the <a href="Mosque%20of%20Omar%20%28Jerusalem%29">Mosque of Omar</a>, known to van Eyck through second-hand textual and visual descriptions. People and animals populate the city walls, but some are only visible under magnification in the Philadelphia painting. The lake by the city shows a boat whose shadow is reflected in the water. Reflective water surfaces were another typical Eyckian innovation, one he seems to have mastered early, evidenced by the water scenes in the Turin-Milan Hours, and which requires a considerable degree of artistry. Plants consist of tiny foreground flowers, larger mid-ground grasses and background bushes and trees. The small carpet of white flowers in the foreground is reminiscent of those in the "Ghent Altarpiece"s central panel; behind Francis are <a href="Chamaerops">dwarf palms</a>.

The <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan Order</a> had a strong following by the 15th century; its <a href="Third%20Order%20of%20Saint%20Francis">Third Order of Saint Francis</a> attracted women and men to local lay <a href="confraternity">confraternities</a>, such as the <a href="Madonna%20of%20the%20Dry%20Tree">Confraternity of the Dry Tree</a> in Bruges to which Anselme Adornes belonged. St Francis was closely associated with pilgrimages, then popular and most often taken to holy sites in Spain and Jerusalem. He was revered for his own pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1219; by the 15th century the Franciscans were responsible for maintaining the holy sites in Jerusalem, particularly the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Sepulchre">Church of the Holy Sepulchre</a>.
St Francis lived austerely, in imitation of Christ. He embraced the natural world, and took vows of poverty, charity and chastity. In 1224 at <a href="La%20Verna">La Verna</a>, he experienced the mystical vision which van Eyck portrays. <a href="Thomas%20of%20Celano">Thomas of Celano</a>, author of Francis's <a href="hagiography">hagiography</a>, describes the vision and stigmatization: "Francis had a vision in which he saw a man like a seraph: he had six wings and was standing above him with his hands outstretched and his feet bound together, and was fixed to a cross. Two wings were lifted above his head, and two were spread ready for flight, and two covered his whole body. When Francis saw this he was utterly amazed. He could not fathom what this vision might mean." As he meditated, "marks of nails began to appear on his hands and feet ... His hands and feet seemed to be pierced by nails appearing on the inside of his hands and the upper side of his feet ... His right side was scarred as if it had been pierced by a spear, and it often seeped blood." To the medieval observer, the appearance of the stigmata signifies Francis's complete absorption in the vision of the seraph.

The Turin and Philadelphia paintings show Francis in profile, kneeling, meditating quietly, facing away from the crucified seraph. Van Eyck eliminated the dramatic pose and rays of light causing the stigmata, which according to Snyder, are generally "essential features of the iconography". Perhaps the wounds on the soles of the feet were intended to be concealed, because the underdrawing of the Turin painting shows Francis wearing sandals. Some scholars, most notably Panofsky, argued against the attribution to van Eyck on the basis of the somewhat arcane iconography. Others, including James Snyder, view the imagery as typical of van Eyck's medieval view of mystical and visionary experience.
Van Eyck's meticulous setting and landscape were another innovation in iconography. Generally La Verna was depicted with sparse detail, whereas here St Francis kneels in a detailed countryside, perhaps a specific spot around La Verna in the Italian <a href="Apennines">Apennines</a>, where striated sandstone is commonly found. The setting is appropriately remote. St Francis appears to stare beyond the vision to the rocks, seemingly unaffected, a common Eyckian device to illustrate a mystical vision. For example, in his "Madonna of Chancellor Rolin" it is difficult to tell whether the location is Mary's throne-room or whether she is merely an apparition in Rolin's chamber – one he seemingly stares past.

Leo, traditionally a sleeping figure smaller than Francis, is here given equal size. Surrounded by barren rocks, he faces away from the seraph, his feet positioned near a small stream, which signifies redemption or salvation, gushing from the rocks. On Francis's left are symbols of life: plants, a river valley, a cityscape and mountains. Snyder writes that for van Eyck a mystical vision had to be presented with great subtlety, and that in these paintings he captures the event perfectly, because Francis is shown as he is said to have reacted to the vision – kneeling in quiet meditation.

The panels are in relatively good condition given their age. The Philadelphia version is better preserved; it has superior tonalities and more prominent colours. In 1906, <a href="Roger%20Fry">Roger Fry</a> gave it a well-documented restoration with overpaint removed. Fry was at the time Curator of Paintings at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum">Metropolitan Museum</a> and performed restorations despite a formal lack of training; the St Francis was the second restoration he undertook. He attributed the work to Hubert van Eyck, and thought the Turin version a copy. His removal of a section at the top revealed a red border; he wrote that van Eyck had "conceived it as a miniature in oil on panel, and that it might indicate a date not very far removed from the drawings of the Turin Book of Hours" (Milan-Turin Hours). In 1926 he recorded: "When it came to me, the panel was considerably larger at the top, and dull opaque sky concealed the join where the extra piece had been added on to satisfy some owner who did not appreciate the compressed composition of the original. The sky had been enlivened ... with a crowd of small white-cloud like forms suggesting the presence of a cohort of angels." His restoration removed more than 10 centimetres; before the restoration it measured , afterwards .

Further conservation was undertaken between 1983 and 1989 using a <a href="stereo%20microscope">stereo microscope</a>. Restorers removed <a href="varnish">varnish</a> that had turned brown as well as layers of old fillers – one of which contained the pigment <a href="viridian">viridian</a>, not available until 1859. They stripped paint additions from the mountain peaks, Leo's robe and in the area around Francis's <a href="tonsure">tonsure</a>. The removal of overpainting revealed an X that had been scratched into the original paint on the upper right stones at some unknown time. According to Butler, the removal of pigment exposed underlying paint in "amazingly good condition".

The Turin panel has suffered heavy <a href="overpainting">overpainting</a> and cracking along the vertical join. The marbleized reddish-brown paint on its reverse is heavily worn. In the 20th century the panel underwent three restorations and extensive technical analyses. The earliest, in 1952, removed overpainting and repaired pigment loss to Francis's tonsure, Leo's cowl and areas of vegetation between the two figures. Restorers discovered an irretrievably lost inscription on a rock adjacent to the seraph-Christ, and evidence of earlier overpainting of one of Leo's feet. Continued paint loss and cracking along the join required further restoration in 1970, when a fixing agent was applied to prevent cracking, and Francis's <a href="tonsure">tonsure</a> was repainted.

Cracking along the vertical join of the wooden panels was severe enough to warrant a third restoration in 1982. <a href="Raking%20light">Raking light</a> revealed that modern varnishes had yellowed, while further overpainting was found. Working under <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light, paint from earlier restorations was removed, uncovering lost colours and landscape details, including the snow-capped mountains and birds of prey on the upper left. Restorers found clues to sources of confusion in earlier restorations, especially the unusual positioning of Francis's tonsure and Leo's feet, which were discovered to be crossed under his body.

Research in the late 19th century lead to what Rishel describes as "one of the thorniest conundrums in the study of Early Netherlandish art", as efforts were made to establish authorship and date the panels in terms of precedence. The panels are neither signed nor dated, and have proved especially difficult to attribute. Establishing an approximate date of completion is usually one of the most important factor in attributing an old master painting. <a href="Dendrochronology">Dendrochronological</a> analysis of the Philadelphia panel dated its <a href="growth%20rings">growth rings</a> to between 1225 and 1307. It was established that the board was cut from the same tree as the wood of two known panels by van Eyck, the "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Baudouin%20de%20Lannoy">Portrait of Baudouin de Lannoy</a>" (c. 1435) and "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Giovanni%20di%20Nicolao%20Arnolfini">Portrait of Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini</a>" (1438). These have tree-rings that developed between 1205 and 1383, and 1206 and 1382, respectively. Examination of the <a href="Sapwood%20%28wood%29">sapwood</a> suggests a felling date of around 1392. Assuming a typical 10 years of seasoning before use, any of the paintings could have begun from around 1408 onwards. The Turin version is painted on two glued boards, vertical to the image. The rings from board I are dated between 1273 and 1359, those of board II from 1282 to 1365.

Based on the perceived "faulty proportions" of the figures, <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Baldass">Ludwig von Baldass</a> suggested a date early in van Eyck's career, around 1425. He attributes the unusual positioning and anatomy to a young and relatively inexperienced painter, one who was still experimenting. He notes how the landscape and individual elements are similar to <a href="Hubert%20van%20Eyck">Hubert van Eyck</a>'s style, but that the close observation of nature reveals Jan's hand. Luber suggests a slightly later date of about 1430, during the period van Eyck finished the "Ghent Altarpiece". She bases her supposition on the fact that van Eyck's employer <a href="Philip%20the%20Bold">Philip the Bold</a> sent him to Portugal in the late 1420s; he would have been unavailable for a commission until his return in 1430. Furthermore, the landscape details, which correlate to van Eyck's work of the period, combined with the return from pilgrimage late in the 1420s of the Adornes brothers (who may have commissioned the two paintings), suggest a completion date of about 1430.
A free copy from some two generations later is in the Prado in Madrid. This is in a vertical format and measures 47 x 36 cm. A large tree is added at the left, and the foreground rocks extended higher. The landscape is somewhat different, and reflects the <a href="world%20landscape">world landscape</a> style of <a href="Joachim%20Patinir">Joachim Patinir</a>, to whom the painting has been attributed in the past. This was largely because the jagged peaks in the distance have been added to and altered to Patinir's trademark depiction of the distinctive landscape of <a href="Dinant">Dinant</a>, his hometown. This panel was attributed by <a href="Max%20Jakob%20Friedl%C3%A4nder">Max Jakob Friedländer</a> to a "Master of Hoogstraten", an anonymous follower of <a href="Quentin%20Massys">Quentin Massys</a>, and dated around 1510. The awkwardness of the figures has been rectified, the placement of his feet and knees "made more rational" according to Rishel, but St Francis stares at the apparition. Another copy, placed tentatively in Brussels c. 1500, is probably a copy of the Turin version.

Noting the similarity of Francis's pose to the kneeling figure in the "<a href="Turin-Milan%20Hours">Turin-Milan Hours</a>" miniature of "The Agony in the Garden", Borchert, who believes van Eyck's work as a manuscript illuminator came late in his career, concludes that both were completed after the master had died, perhaps completed by members of the workshop. Unlike Borchert, Luber thinks that "The Agony" evidences his early experiments with perspective, as he began to resolve the transition between foreground and background, by placing the fence in the mid-ground, a device found in the St Francis through the positioning of the rocks. Luber says the underdrawings in the miniature are similar to those in the St Francis paintings, and stylistically typical of those in van Eyck's later work, an important factor when considering attribution.

Although the tree-ring analysis of the Philadelphia painting firmly places it in van Eyck's workshop, the technical evidence fails to prove indisputably whether van Eyck or a workshop member painted it. Until the early 1980s it was thought that the Philadelphia panel was the original and the Turin panel a copy, but <a href="x-ray">x-ray</a> analysis revealed a highly developed and sophisticated design underneath the paint that is accepted as by Jan van Eyck's hand. <a href="Infrared%20reflectography">Infrared reflectography</a> further disclosed extensive underdrawings beneath the original paint; the artist even made alterations to the composition after laying down the underdrawings and completing the painting. The underdrawings are typical of van Eyck's work and similar to those found in the "Ghent Altarpiece", thereby, according to Luber, tying the Turin version to van Eyck.

There are three possibilities; the panels are van Eyck originals; they were completed by workshop members after his death from one of his underdrawings; or they were created by a highly talented follower compiling a <a href="pastiche">pastiche</a> of Eyckian motifs. While a majority of specialists have come to believe they are van Eyck originals, there have been significant dissenting voices in the recent past. Opinion in the mid-20th century generally favoured a van Eyck; significantly, <a href="Erwin%20Panofsky">Erwin Panofsky</a> expressed doubts regarding the attribution.

Marigene Butler, head conservator at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, oversaw a multi-national research project between 1983 and 1989. Her team investigated the provenance of the two paintings and relationships between them through technical analyses. At that time both paintings underwent further restorations. They examined the wooden supports, parchment fibres and priming layers of the Philadelphia painting. A sample of paint was taken from the seraph-Christ's wings; analysis found particles of pure <a href="lapis%20lazuli">ultramarine</a>, the most expensive pigment at the time. The team identified <a href="Red%23Red%20lac%2C%20red%20lake%20and%20crimson%20lake">red organic lake</a> in the stigmata wounds, and vermilion and <a href="White%20lead">lead white</a> on Francis's cheeks. <a href="Infrared">Infrared</a> reflectography found a base layer of paint overlaid with <a href="hatching">hatching</a> and fine brush strokes on an additional layer. The greenery was painted with a <a href="Verdigris">copper resinate</a> that over time has darkened to brown. The mountains and sky were painted with ultramarine and lead white. Compared to the Turin painting, the Philadelphia version shows little evidence of underdrawing.

Butler found the structure and details of the two paintings to be almost identical. The individual components matched "quite precisely", but were slightly off register, raising questions as to whether one was copied from the other. The Turin painting has a simpler paint structure than the other, more extensive underdrawing, and finer pigment particles, and the colours differ. The stones in the Philadelphia painting are darker and more orange than the predominantly grey hues of the Turin rocks. The greenery in the Philadelphia version shows more discolouration than in the other. Under magnification the paintings' brush strokes are near identical, particularly in the rendering of the clouds.

The Pale Emperor

The Pale Emperor is the ninth studio album by American <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="Marilyn%20Manson%20%28band%29">Marilyn Manson</a>. It was released on January 15, 2015, through lead singer <a href="Marilyn%20Manson">Marilyn Manson</a>'s <a href="Hell%2C%20etc.%20%28label%29">Hell, etc.</a> label, and distributed in the United States by <a href="Loma%20Vista%20Recordings">Loma Vista Recordings</a> and internationally by <a href="Cooking%20Vinyl">Cooking Vinyl</a>. The album was issued in standard and deluxe editions on <a href="Compact%20disc">CD</a> and double <a href="LP%20record">LP vinyl</a>, and as a limited edition box set. The standard version of the album contains ten tracks; the deluxe edition includes three <a href="Acoustic%20music">acoustic</a> versions as bonus tracks.

Produced by Manson and newcomer <a href="Tyler%20Bates">Tyler Bates</a>, who Manson met through their mutual involvement in the TV series "<a href="Californication%20%28TV%20series%29">Californication</a>", "The Pale Emperor" eschews the band's usual <a href="industrial%20rock">industrial rock</a> style in favor of a sparser, <a href="blues%20rock">blues rock</a>-influenced sound. The album features drummer <a href="Gil%20Sharone">Gil Sharone</a>, formerly of <a href="Stolen%20Babies">Stolen Babies</a> and <a href="The%20Dillinger%20Escape%20Plan">The Dillinger Escape Plan</a>. It was the first album since his return to the band in 2008 to not include songwriting or performance contributions from bassist <a href="Twiggy%20Ramirez">Twiggy</a>, who was busy with his own projects. The album is dedicated to Manson's mother, who died of <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a> during production.

The album was released to positive reviews from <a href="Music%20journalism">music critics</a>. Several writers referred to it as the band's best album in over a decade, and multiple publications ranked it as one of the best albums of 2015. It was also a commercial success, debuting at number eight on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> with the band's highest opening week sales since "<a href="Eat%20Me%2C%20Drink%20Me">Eat Me, Drink Me</a>" (2007). It topped "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>"'s <a href="Top%20Hard%20Rock%20Albums">Hard Rock Albums</a> chart, as well as the national <a href="Record%20chart">albums chart</a> in <a href="Swiss%20Albums%20Chart">Switzerland</a>, and peaked within the top ten in fifteen other countries.

Three official singles were released, "<a href="Third%20Day%20of%20a%20Seven%20Day%20Binge">Third Day of a Seven Day Binge</a>", "<a href="Cupid%20Carries%20a%20Gun">Cupid Carries a Gun</a>" and "<a href="Deep%20Six%20%28song%29">Deep Six</a>"; the latter became the band's highest-peaking single on "Billboard"'s <a href="Mainstream%20Rock%20%28chart%29">Mainstream Rock Chart</a>; "<a href="The%20Mephistopheles%20of%20Los%20Angeles">The Mephistopheles of Los Angeles</a>" and "<a href="The%20Devil%20Beneath%20My%20Feet">The Devil Beneath My Feet</a>" have been released as <a href="Promotional%20recording%23Promo%20single">promotional singles</a>. The album was supported by <a href="The%20Hell%20Not%20Hallelujah%20Tour">The Hell Not Hallelujah Tour</a>, which was interspersed with two co-headlining tours: <a href="The%20End%20Times%20Tour">The End Times</a> with <a href="The%20Smashing%20Pumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a>, and a summer 2016 tour with <a href="Slipknot%20%28band%29">Slipknot</a>.

<a href="Marilyn%20Manson%20%28band%29">Marilyn Manson</a> was one of the most controversial <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">metal</a> bands of the late 1990s. In 1999, news media falsely <a href="Marilyn%20Manson%20%E2%80%93%20Columbine%20High%20School%20massacre%20controversy">scapegoated the band</a> for influencing the <a href="Eric%20Harris%20and%20Dylan%20Klebold">perpetrators</a> of the <a href="Columbine%20High%20School%20massacre">Columbine High School massacre</a>, which the vocalist has claimed "totally shoved [my career] in the dirt". Subsequent albums were criticized by both critics and fans alike, and the band was dropped by its long-time record label <a href="Interscope%20Records">Interscope</a> in 2009. A year later, they signed a joint-venture deal with London-based <a href="independent%20record%20label">independent record label</a> <a href="Cooking%20Vinyl">Cooking Vinyl</a>. "<a href="Born%20Villain">Born Villain</a>" was released in 2012, and was heralded as a return to form.

In August 2012, it was announced that Manson would play a fictionalized version of himself in a four-episode <a href="Story%20arc">arc</a> of the sixth season of TV series "<a href="Californication%20%28TV%20series%29">Californication</a>". While filming its season finale, Manson met the series' <a href="score%20composer">score composer</a>, <a href="Tyler%20Bates">Tyler Bates</a>, and the two discussed a potential collaboration. In May 2013, Manson confirmed that production had started on new material. They held their first writing session in a small rehearsal space, accompanied by former <a href="Slayer">Slayer</a> drummer <a href="Dave%20Lombardo">Dave Lombardo</a>. This session proved unsuccessful, and the pair failed to write any substantial material. Bates later suggested that they hold further writing sessions at his home studio, which resulted in their composition of "Birds of Hell Awaiting" in "one spontaneous exchange".

This was quickly followed by "<a href="Third%20Day%20of%20a%20Seven%20Day%20Binge">Third Day of a Seven Day Binge</a>". Manson said that the recording of the album "just became a rhythm. This was something I was excited to do." This is in stark contrast to the recording of "<a href="The%20High%20End%20of%20Low">The High End of Low</a>" (2009) and "Born Villain", when he was frequently "dragged into the studio" late at night to record vocals. He credited this enthusiasm to the collaborative process between him and Bates, saying that he realized after the first performance of "Birds of Hell Awaiting" that "[I] just sang it. I didn't even know where the music was going to go and I just went with it and it was very organic. And then it opened up a whole different part of my mind."

Bates called the recording process "seamless" because of the unconventional studio environment. Manson, isolated in a <a href="Recording%20studio%23Isolation%20booth">vocal booth</a> with no more than three people in the <a href="Digital%20audio%20workstation">control room</a> at any one time, was free to improvise or develop new lyrics and vocal melodies at a high speed. By using <a href="Pro%20Tools">Pro Tools</a>, Bates was able to "manipulate the music in a way that would allow [Manson] to just keep working on it without causing [a delay]. If he had an idea, he could just throw it down without there being a lot to explain." The majority of the album was recorded during a three-month period. The band's manager, Tony Ciulla, only became aware that Manson had been recording new material when he was invited to Bates' home recording studio, where Bates played final cuts of nine of the album's ten tracks; "<a href="Cupid%20Carries%20a%20Gun">Cupid Carries a Gun</a>" was the only track not yet completed. With the base tracks recorded, <a href="overdubbing">overdubbing</a> took place over the following six months between Manson's acting commitments on "<a href="Sons%20of%20Anarchy">Sons of Anarchy</a>" and Bates scoring the 2014 television series "<a href="Salem%20%28TV%20series%29">Salem</a>".

<a href="Gil%20Sharone">Gil Sharone</a>, of <a href="The%20Dillinger%20Escape%20Plan">The Dillinger Escape Plan</a> and <a href="Stolen%20Babies">Stolen Babies</a>, performed live drums on the album. Sharone was first contacted by Bates about the project in January 2014, three days before he was due to begin a tour with Stolen Babies. He developed and recorded his drum work over two days at Igloo Studios in <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank, California</a>. Long-time bassist – and Manson's chief collaborator – <a href="Twiggy%20Ramirez">Twiggy</a> did not take part in the writing and recording process, as he was busy recording his own material. It was the first release since his return to the band in 2008 to not feature Twiggy's involvement. His collaborator on the <a href="Goon%20Moon">Goon Moon</a> project, <a href="Fred%20Sablan">Fred Sablan</a>, departed Marilyn Manson on good terms. Manson's "Sons of Anarchy" co-star <a href="Walton%20Goggins">Walton Goggins</a> appears as a preacher on album track "Slave Only Dreams to Be King", reciting two verses from <a href="James%20Allen%20%28author%29">James Allen</a>s early 20th-century essay "<a href="As%20a%20Man%20Thinketh">As a Man Thinketh</a>". Manson announced that the band's new album was "prepared for landing" in early September. He dedicated the record to his mother, Barbara Warner, who died on May 13, 2014, eight years after being diagnosed with <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>.

In a January 2014 interview with "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>" magazine, Manson described the sound of the album as being "very cinematic", saying that the "<a href="redneck">redneck</a> in me comes out in my voice" owing to the album's inclusion of <a href="blues">blues</a> influences, while still retaining the harder elements of previous work. The album has been compared to the music which was used to soundtrack "Sons of Anarchy". Manson called himself "a man of few words" [on the record], opting to allow melody to be its primary focus, instead of using characters or extended metaphors to compose lyrics. Lyrics for the album were all derived from a single notebook, with Manson admitting that the content of previous work was too scattered, as they were composed of material taken from up to 20 different notebooks. He has described it as being intentionally sparse lyrically, elaborating that blues music stems from the "guttural, visceral element of music. I [left] holes in these stories so it becomes your story, it becomes more cinematic. For example in the film "<a href="Rosemary%27s%20Baby%20%28film%29">Rosemary's Baby</a>", you don't see the baby but in your mind you do."

"The Pale Emperor" is a departure from the band's usual style, leaning away from the <a href="Industrial%20music">industrial</a> production that appeared on much of their previous work and incorporating a sparser sound, which has been described as <a href="alternative%20country">alternative country</a>, <a href="blues%20rock">blues rock</a>, <a href="gothic%20metal">gothic metal</a> and <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a>. Manson cited the music of <a href="Muddy%20Waters">Muddy Waters</a>, <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>, and <a href="The%20Doors">The Doors</a> as inspirations. <a href="Steven%20Hyden">Steven Hyden</a> of "<a href="Grantland">Grantland</a>" identified several parallels between "The Pale Emperor" and the Doors' 1971 album "<a href="L.A.%20Woman">L.A. Woman</a>", suggesting that in the two albums both bands were re-energized in the latter part of their career. He also compared Manson's vocal style to that of <a href="Jim%20Morrison">Jim Morrison</a>, and claimed the album's lyrics echo Morrison's "self-destructive self-aggrandizement".

The album's title is a reference to <a href="Constantius%20Chlorus">Constantius I</a> – or Constantius the Pale – who was the first <a href="Roman%20emperor">Roman emperor</a> to deny the <a href="Religion%20in%20ancient%20Rome">existence of a God</a>. Manson has said its meaning can have several interpretations: "complexion or <a href="Gothic%20rock">Goth music</a> or '<a href="wikt%3Abeyond%20the%20pale">beyond the pale</a>' or [...] everything '<a href="wikt%3Apale%20in%20comparison">pales in comparison</a>' to it". Lyrically, the album deals with <a href="Death">mortality</a>, <a href="war">war</a>, <a href="violence">violence</a>, <a href="slavery">slavery</a> and <a href="Organized%20religion">religion</a>, and includes references to <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> and <a href="German%20folklore">German folklore</a>, specifically the story of <a href="Faust">Faust</a> and <a href="Mephistopheles">Mephistopheles</a>. "<a href="The%20Mephistopheles%20of%20Los%20Angeles">The Mephistopheles of Los Angeles</a>" was the original title track and, according to Manson, the album's heart. "The Pale Emperor" makes use of an extended metaphor, in which Manson compares his own career to the life of Faust. He told "<a href="The%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>" that he "sold [his] soul to become a rock star, and this payment in full—with interest, considering the last few bills I didn't pay," explaining that he considered "The High End of Low" and "Born Villain" lacking in focus. He elaborated to <a href="Classic%20Rock%20%28magazine%29">"Classic Rock" magazine</a>:

Throughout the album, Manson sings in a different key than on any of the band's previous releases. He has claimed that his voice can emit five different <a href="Tonality">tones</a> simultaneously, and that mixing engineer <a href="Robert%20Carranza">Robert Carranza</a> showed him that a recording of his vocals formed a visual <a href="pentagram">pentagram</a> when imported into a <a href="Audio%20analyzer">phrasal analyzer</a>. Bates has said that the vocals on the album are stripped down in comparison to previous records, which he considered to be <a href="Overproduction%20%28music%29">overproduced</a>.

The band announced the album's title and release date on its <a href="MarilynManson.com">official website</a> on November 9, 2014. Its global release schedule started on January 15, 2015. Formats included standard and deluxe edition <a href="Compact%20disc">CDs</a>; a heavyweight 180-gram double <a href="LP%20record">LP vinyl</a> album, available in black, <a href="Unusual%20types%20of%20gramophone%20records%23Coloured%20vinyl">white</a> and a grey <a href="marble">marble</a>-effect limited edition, the latter of which was exclusive to <a href="Hot%20Topic">Hot Topic</a>; and as a <a href="Music%20download">digital download</a>, including <a href="Audio%20bit%20depth">24-bit</a> <a href="Audio%20Interchange%20File%20Format">AIFF</a> and <a href="WAV">WAV</a> format files, which were released exclusively on <a href="Qobuz">Qobuz</a>. The LP discs were manufactured at Record Technology, Inc. in <a href="Camarillo%2C%20California">Camarillo, California</a>, on high-quality vinyl. A digital download of the album was packaged with all LP editions.

The standard version of the album contains ten tracks and the deluxe edition adds three acoustic versions as bonus tracks. Editions of the album sold at <a href="Walmart">Walmart</a> stores in North America feature a censored version of "<a href="The%20Devil%20Beneath%20My%20Feet">The Devil Beneath My Feet</a>". Manson later criticized the store and its gun sales policy, categorizing Walmart in an Australian interview as "that store in America which sells guns to kids but won't sell R-rated lyrics." Manson went on to joke that he might "do a signing at a Walmart store where I just sign guns, and you get a free record with it when you buy a gun." American CD versions of the album were packaged with black <a href="polycarbonate">polycarbonate</a> discs identical to those used by Sony for the original <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a> in the early 1990s; the discs were sourced by Brian Schuman of <a href="Concord%20Bicycle%20Music">Concord Music</a> from the same plant Sony used. A heat-sensitive <a href="Thermography">thermal</a> texture was added to the CD, so that it appeared black when first opened but revealed a white pattern when exposed to the heat from a CD player.

The album was also released as a limited edition "Definitive Box" set, which was sold exclusively on the bands webstore. Designed by Manson with Willo Perron and Hassan Rahim, the set included the deluxe CD and white vinyl editions of the album and several exclusive items, including a grey cloth-bound individually numbered collectors box, five <a href="Lithography">lithographs</a> designed by artist Nicholas Cope, a fold-out 24-inch poster, album sleeves printed on full-color UV-coated stock and a "Pale Emperor" T-shirt. A special edition containing a bonus <a href="DVD">DVD</a> of music videos was later released in <a href="Japan">Japan</a>.

Music from the album was previewed almost nine months before its official release, when "Cupid Carries a Gun" appeared as the opening theme to the television series "<a href="Salem%20%28TV%20series%29">Salem</a>" from April 27, 2014 onward. A large portion of the album track "<a href="Killing%20Strangers">Killing Strangers</a>" was featured in the film "<a href="John%20Wick%20%28film%29">John Wick</a>", which was released in cinemas on October 24. Two days later, "Third Day of a Seven Day Binge" was premiered on <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a>'s "Rock Show" by <a href="Daniel%20P.%20Carter">Daniel P. Carter</a>. Immediately after the broadcast, the song was released for free download on the band's official website, and then released as a one-track single via <a href="music%20download">music download</a> services on November 10. The band, which consisted of Bates and Paul Wiley on guitars, Twiggy on bass and Sharone on drums, performed several new songs live for the first time in October and early November, when they played a handful of concerts in southern California. On <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a> night, they were joined onstage by actor <a href="Johnny%20Depp">Johnny Depp</a> and <a href="Watkin%20Tudor%20Jones">Ninja</a> from <a href="Die%20Antwoord">Die Antwoord</a> for a performance of Manson's 1996 single "<a href="The%20Beautiful%20People%20%28song%29">The Beautiful People</a>" at the <a href="Roxy%20Theatre%20%28West%20Hollywood%29">Roxy Theatre</a>. On December 5, Manson settled a fifteen-year rift with <a href="The%20Smashing%20Pumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a> frontman <a href="Billy%20Corgan">Billy Corgan</a>, joining the Pumpkins at their show at the <a href="Camden%20Palace%20Theatre">Camden Palace Theatre</a> in <a href="London">London</a> to perform "Third Day of a Seven Day Binge" and Pumpkins song "<a href="Ava%20Adore">Ava Adore</a>".
"<a href="Deep%20Six%20%28song%29">Deep Six</a>" was released as the album's official lead single on December 16. A music video for the song, directed by Bart Hess, was released on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> three days later. The song debuted at number thirty-three on "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>"'s <a href="Mainstream%20Rock%20%28chart%29">Mainstream Rock Chart</a> on the issue dated December 23, 2014, as the "greatest gainer" that week, before rising to number eight on the chart dated March 14, 2015, becoming the band's highest-peaking single on the chart. In response to the album <a href="Internet%20leak">leaking online</a>, it was made available to <a href="Streaming%20media">stream</a> on the site <a href="Genius%20%28website%29">Genius</a> on January 12, eight days ahead of its official US release. "Cupid Carries a Gun" was released as a digital single on January 7, 2015. The band began <a href="The%20Hell%20Not%20Hallelujah%20Tour">The Hell Not Hallelujah Tour</a> on January 21, 2015. They performed at several music festivals throughout the year, including <a href="Soundwave%20%28Australian%20music%20festival%29">Soundwave</a> in Australia, <a href="Rock%20am%20Ring%20and%20Rock%20im%20Park">Rock am Ring and Rock im Park</a> in Germany, the <a href="Download%20Festival">Download Festival</a> in the UK and <a href="Hellfest%20%28French%20music%20festival%29">Hellfest</a> in France.

Manson and his father, Hugh Warner, appeared together in the February issue of "<a href="Paper%20%28magazine%29">Paper</a>" magazine. The shoot, by photographer <a href="Terry%20Richardson">Terry Richardson</a>, featured the pair wearing identical make-up and contained an explicit image in which Hugh is shown fondling his own genitalia. On April 12, Bates announced that he had retired from the band's touring line-up under amicable circumstances. Bates said he had prepared the band to function without him, anticipating a departure once obligations in the film and TV industry made his schedule too difficult for touring. Rhythm guitarist Paul Wiley replaced Bates on lead guitar for the duration of the tour. A music video for "The Mephistopheles of Los Angeles", directed by <a href="Francesco%20Carrozzini">Francesco Carrozzini</a> and featuring a cameo from actor <a href="Michael%20K.%20Williams">Michael K. Williams</a>, was released on May 11. On June 11, Manson was honored with a <a href="Lifetime%20Achievement%20Award">Lifetime Achievement Award</a> at the 2015 <a href="Kerrang%21%20Awards">Kerrang! Awards</a>. Later that month, he appeared as the <a href="Keynote">keynote speaker</a> at the 2015 <a href="Cannes%20Lions%20International%20Festival%20of%20Creativity">Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity</a>.

<a href="The%20End%20Times%20Tour">The End Times</a>, a 23-date co-headlining tour of North America with The Smashing Pumpkins, began in <a href="Concord%2C%20California">Concord, California</a> on July 7. On July 10, the band released a music video for "Third Day of a Seven Day Binge". In February 2016, Manson contributed vocals to a version of <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a>'s "<a href="Cat%20People%20%28Putting%20Out%20Fire%29">Cat People (Putting Out Fire)</a>" on "<a href="Countach%20%28For%20Giorgio%29">Countach (For Giorgio)</a>", a <a href="tribute%20album">tribute album</a> to <a href="Giorgio%20Moroder">Giorgio Moroder</a> curated by <a href="Shooter%20Jennings">Shooter Jennings</a>. A <a href="16-bit">16-bit</a> music video for the song was released in August. The band also announced details of another co-headlining tour, this time with <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> band <a href="Slipknot%20%28band%29">Slipknot</a>. This tour was scheduled to begin on June 9 in <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City">Salt Lake City</a> and consist of thirty-four dates in <a href="Amphitheatre">Amphitheatre</a>s throughout North America, with <a href="Of%20Mice%20%26amp%3B%20Men%20%28band%29">Of Mice & Men</a> supporting. The first twelve dates of the tour were postponed after a physical examination revealed that <a href="Corey%20Taylor">Corey Taylor</a> had broken two <a href="vertebrae">vertebrae</a> in his neck. The tour began on June 28 in <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>, with the postponed shows rescheduled for August.

"The Pale Emperor" received generally positive reviews from <a href="Music%20journalism">music critics</a>. At <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which assigns a <a href="weighted%20mean">weighted mean</a> rating out of 100 to reviews from music critics, the album received an average score of 71, indicating generally favorable reviews, based on 19 publications.

Numerous publications referred to it as being the band's best album in over 15 years. Alec Chillingworth of Stereoboard suggested that it saw Manson "climbing back to the creative summit he fell from following "Holy Wood"." He praised the record for its musical diversity, saying that "by expanding his palette and finally getting it right, it reinstates Marilyn Manson as a relevant musical force, and an elder statesman of the industrial scene." He awarded the album four out of five stars. Several other writers compared it to "<a href="Mechanical%20Animals">Mechanical Animals</a>" (1998). A writer for the blog "Sonic Abuse" said it was grander in scope than any of their albums since late 90s, and ranked it among the best releases of the band's discography.

The record was lauded for its combination of differing genres, and its concision. J.C. Maçek III of "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" praised the scope of musical variety found on the album, with particular acclaim given for its incorporation of <a href="alternative%20country">alternative country</a> elements. Fred Thomas of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> noted its inclusion of blues influences, and said that this shift in musical direction resulted in the album sounding more sinister than any of the band's previous work. The record was featured in <a href="Loudwire">Loudwire</a> as their editors' pick for the month of January 2015, where it was called a "satisfying listening experience from top to bottom". A reviewer for "<a href="Music%20Feeds">Music Feeds</a>" compared "The Pale Emperor" to "<a href="Antichrist%20Superstar">Antichrist Superstar</a>" (1996), commenting that both albums work best when listened to as a whole. <a href="Drowned%20in%20Sound">Drowned in Sound</a> critic Dave Hanratty praised Bates' production and the album's consistency, writing "damned if the devil didn't bring his best tunes to this dance."

Critics also praised the quality and maturity of the band's songwriting. Corey Deiterman of the "<a href="Houston%20Press">Houston Press</a>" called "The Pale Emperor" a "triumphant return to the songwriting principles that made him famous in the first place." In a positive review for <a href="Yahoo%21%20Music">Yahoo! Music</a>, Allan Raible highlighted the album's focus on songcraft instead of shock value. Similarly, "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>" said that it "trades shock-tastic thrills for something even darker", calling it "brave, smart and intriguing." Dean Brown of <a href="The%20Quietus">The Quietus</a> said Manson was a revitalized performer, and praised the record for its addictive <a href="Hook%20%28music%29">hooks</a>. Jeff Miers of "<a href="The%20Buffalo%20News">The Buffalo News</a>", who regarded "The Pale Emperor" as the band's first excellent post-millennial collection of music, praised its lyrical content, saying that Manson sounds "both inspired and disgusted [throughout], which is usually the tightrope he walks when he's doing his best work." A review for "<a href="Revolver%20%28magazine%29">Revolver</a>" dubbed it an album of the year contender, and it topped the publication's weekly readers poll.

The album received some mixed reviews, however. Louis Pattison, reviewing for "<a href="NME">NME</a>", said that the album would not be considered a classic, but complimented the material for a reduced emphasis on shock value. A reviewer for "<a href="Consequence%20of%20Sound">Consequence of Sound</a>" wrote that "A lack of 'oomph' prevents the album from landing a gut punch that would cover all of its flaws. Like an aging boxer, Manson lands jabs and the occasional uppercut, but he never topples his opponent." <a href="Neil%20McCormick">Neil McCormick</a> of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" compared the record to the early work of English <a href="gothic%20rock">gothic rock</a> band <a href="Bauhaus%20%28band%29">Bauhaus</a>, and said that while it was "undeniably effective [...] in small bursts," he found the whole "wearingly abrasive". Daniel Sylvester of "<a href="Exclaim%21">Exclaim!</a>", although he admired the ambition of the album, complained it was "lazy when it can get away with it".

Industry forecasters predicted that "The Pale Emperor" was on course for a top ten debut on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, with estimated first-week sales of around 42,000 units. The album debuted at number eight on the chart with sales of over 51,000 <a href="album-equivalent%20unit">album-equivalent unit</a>s, of which 49,000 units were "pure" album sales—that is, traditional copies of the album, rather than units calculated as a measure of track sales or streaming. This was the band's highest opening-week figure since "<a href="Eat%20Me%2C%20Drink%20Me">Eat Me, Drink Me</a>" debuted at the same position with 88,000 copies in 2007, and was their sixth consecutive top ten album. It also debuted at number six on "Billboard"s Top Albums Sales—the current equivalent of the "Billboard" 200 before it was reconfigured to accommodate track sales and streaming—as well as number three on <a href="Top%20Rock%20Albums">Top Rock Albums</a> and number one on the <a href="Top%20Hard%20Rock%20Albums">Top Hard Rock Albums</a> charts. On its second week, the album dropped to number 24 on the Top Albums Chart, selling a further 12,275 "pure" copies. As of December 2015, "The Pale Emperor" has sold more than 136,000 "pure" copies in the US. The album debuted at number four on the <a href="Canadian%20Albums%20Chart">Canadian Albums Chart</a>, with sales of over 5,000 copies on its first week according to <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a>.

In <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>, the album debuted on the <a href="Russian%20Music%20Charts">Russian Albums Chart</a> at number ten on the chart dated January 18, 2015, based on three days of sale on the Russian <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a> store. The album rose to number two the following week, on its first full week of release in the country. It debuted at number one on the <a href="Swiss%20Hitparade">Swiss Albums Chart</a>, making it the band's second number-one album there following "<a href="The%20Golden%20Age%20of%20Grotesque">The Golden Age of Grotesque</a>" (2003). In the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">United Kingdom</a>, it debuted at number sixteen with sales of 5,984 copies, and was their seventh consecutive album to peak within the top twenty. The album peaked at number four on the <a href="GfK%20Entertainment">German Albums Chart</a>, and was their highest-charting album in the territory since "Eat Me, Drink Me". "The Pale Emperor" became Manson's fifth top-ten album in France, where it debuted at number five with sales of over 6,700 copies. It has gone on to sell over 30,000 copies there.

From The Doctor to my son Thomas

"From The Doctor to my son Thomas" is a <a href="viral%20video">viral video</a> recorded by actor <a href="Peter%20Capaldi">Peter Capaldi</a> and sent to Thomas Goodall, an <a href="autism">autistic</a> nine-year-old boy in England, to console the child over grief from the death of Goodall's grandmother. Capaldi filmed the 42-second video in character as the <a href="Twelfth%20Doctor">12th incarnation</a> of <a href="The%20Doctor%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">The Doctor</a> in the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> science-fiction series "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>". Capaldi's message had a positive effect on Thomas; his father said that the boy smiled for the first time since learning of his grandmother's death, and gained the courage to go to her funeral.

Thomas' father Ross Goodall posted the video to <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> on 6 November 2014. He later explained to the media that he wanted to make the video available to his family and had no idea it would become popular online. <a href="CNN">CNN</a> reported that after its appearance on YouTube, the video was viewed over 200,000 times in its first 48 hours online. This more than doubled the next day, and less than a week later it had over 900,000 total views. <a href="BBC%20News">BBC News</a> observed that Capaldi's message had become a viral video, and "<a href="ITV%20News">ITV News</a>" described response to the video as a <a href="Internet%20phenomenon">global phenomenon</a>.

"<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" and "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" called the recording by Capaldi a touching video to a young child suffering from grief. CNN and <a href="MTV">MTV</a> characterised the video similarly, as did Spanish and Dutch media. "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" wrote that Capaldi displayed a kinder face of his personality by sending the message. <a href="BT%20Group">BT</a> commented it was Capaldi's best contribution as the character of the Doctor to date. The video had a positive impact on those with <a href="mental%20health">mental health</a> problems. "Autism Daily Newscast" reported favourably on the Doctor's actions. "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" observed that as his character the Doctor, Capaldi was using his role to support mental health. "<a href="Hollywood%20Life">Hollywood Life</a>" said their reporters were moved to tears after watching Capaldi's video. <a href="Peter%20Harness">Peter Harness</a>, writer of the episode "<a href="Kill%20the%20Moon">Kill the Moon</a>", said that Capaldi's video was his favourite highlight from ten years of "Doctor Who".

The Scottish actor and film director <a href="Peter%20Capaldi">Peter Capaldi</a> was cast in 2013 as the <a href="Twelfth%20Doctor">12th incarnation</a> of the Doctor, in the BBC science-fiction series "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>". His casting was announced on 4 August 2013 in a special BBC programme hosted by <a href="Zo%C3%AB%20Ball">Zoë Ball</a>. Capaldi first appeared as the Doctor in a cameo in the 50th anniversary special "<a href="The%20Day%20of%20the%20Doctor">The Day of the Doctor</a>", before appearing in the 2013 Christmas special "<a href="The%20Time%20of%20the%20Doctor">The Time of the Doctor</a>". A lifelong fan of the series, Capaldi had played Lobus Caecilius in the 2008 episode "<a href="The%20Fires%20of%20Pompeii">The Fires of Pompeii</a>" and a civil servant, <a href="John%20Frobisher">John Frobisher</a>, in the 2009 spin-off "".

Before taking the role, Capaldi said that he had to seriously consider the increased visibility that would come with the part. He said in an interview with "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" that he had been invited to audition for the role of the <a href="Eighth%20Doctor">Eighth Doctor</a> in 1995 before the production of <a href="Doctor%20Who%20%28film%29">the 1996 TV film</a>, but did not go because he was unsure if he would get the part and did not wish to be part of a large group of actors turned down for the role.

Thomas Goodall, from <a href="North%20Baddesley">North Baddesley</a> in <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, had been a devoted fan of "Doctor Who" since the age of two and wrote a letter to Peter Capaldi saying he hoped the actor found success in his new role portraying the Doctor. The Goodall family were all fans of "Doctor Who", describing themselves as <a href="Doctor%20Who%20fandom">Whovian</a>s. Thomas decorated his home with objects related to the television series. Capaldi wrote back to Thomas thanking him, and sent a note to the child's father saying that he intended to send a video message. Capaldi enclosed guidance to Ross Goodall on how to organise a tour of the production studios for "Doctor Who".

Ross Goodall subsequently communicated with Capaldi through the actor's agent, to inform him that Thomas's grandmother had died. (Helen, aged 72, died in early October 2014.) He told Capaldi that his son was not dealing well with the grief from his grandmother's death. The family received the subsequent video message to Thomas from Capaldi three weeks after the death of the child's grandmother.

Capaldi appears in character as the Doctor and addresses Thomas directly, greeting him by name. He expresses his gratitude at receiving the child's letter, saying that it had pleased him.

He then speaks to Thomas about grief, mentioning the Doctor's adventures with <a href="Companion%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">travelling companion</a> <a href="Clara%20Oswald">Clara Oswald</a>. He tells Thomas that negative events impact Clara and himself in their journeys through the universe and <a href="time%20travel">time travel</a>, and that occasionally they feel depressed too. The Doctor tells Thomas that he is glad the child is supporting him in his adventures.

Capaldi concludes the 42 second video message by wishing Thomas to experience joy, and encourages the youth to be well and remain positive.

The family received the video from Capaldi on 3 November 2014. After viewing the video, Thomas felt encouraged to attend his grandmother's funeral. In an interview with "The Guardian", Ross Goodall explained that Capaldi's mention of sadness resonated with the child due to his experience of grief over his grandmother's death. He discussed the manner in which Thomas perceived emotions as a strict dichotomy between positive and negative without a middle ground. Thomas interpreted from the video that it was all right to feel happy while simultaneously acknowledging that a sad event had occurred. Ross Goodall told "The Guardian" that before viewing the video from Capaldi, his son had not wanted to attend the funeral.

The boy's mother said that the video had helped him to deal with his depression. After watching Capaldi's message, Ross Goodall stated that his son's behaviour patterns changed markedly. This change included the ability to comfort his sister and step out of his day-to-day routine. Ross Goodall said that after watching the video, his son smiled for the first time since his grandmother's death. The family framed the letter from Capaldi that came before the video message, and Ross Goodall said that Thomas looked at it when he felt distressed.

Ross Goodall uploaded the message from Capaldi to the video-sharing website <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> on 6 November 2014. He commented at the video's YouTube location that he was surprised at the online response, and that at the time of initial posting was unaware it would <a href="viral%20video">become viral</a>. He later explained that he had uploaded it only to share it with family members on completion of the memorial services for Thomas's grandmother. Thomas's father wrote that the video greatly affected his son, and enabled him to cope with grief and feel comforted. He praised Capaldi for his kind act and explained that the video improved his son's mental well-being throughout the ordeal.

By 10 November 2014, total comments by viewers posted below the video on YouTube numbered in the hundreds. The majority of comments were supportive. Visitors to the site wrote favourably of Capaldi's actions to record the video for the child. A few observed that Capaldi's version of the Doctor character is sinister and serious, and contrasted this with the actor's depiction of the character as warm and effusive in his recording.

<a href="CNN">CNN</a> reported that after its appearance on YouTube, the video had over 200,000 views in its first 48 hours of availability. <a href="BBC%20News">BBC News</a> noted that by the next day, it had received over 500,000 views, and by 10 November 2014 it had over 750,000. "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" noted that by the next day the view count was above 900,000. Multiple publications observed that Capaldi's message had become a viral video. "<a href="ITV%20News">ITV News</a>" called online reaction to the video a <a href="Internet%20phenomenon">global phenomenon</a>.

"<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" called the recording by Capaldi a touching video tribute. CNN characterised the video similarly, as did "<a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>", "ITV News", "<a href="TV%203%20%28Ireland%29">TV 3</a>", and publications in Spanish and Dutch. The <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> newspaper "<a href="La%20Vanguardia">La Vanguardia</a>" wrote that Capaldi's video was an example of bringing joy into someone's life through a small act. "The Washington Post" called it a touching message. "<a href="The%20Daily%20Dot">The Daily Dot</a>" described the video as inspirational. "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" contrasted Capaldi's portrayal of the <a href="Twelfth%20Doctor">12th Doctor</a> as one of the darker incarnations of the character with his kinder message as the same character in the video. "<a href="MTV">MTV</a>" called Capaldi a most wonderful person for his act, and concluded that the video was quite endearing.

"<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" described the video as a moving inspiration to a child suffering from grief. "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>" wrote that if they were able to engage in time travel themselves, they would be unable to encounter a kinder tale. "<a href="Io9">Io9</a>" appreciated that Capaldi was using his celebrity status to effect positive change through his portrayal of the character, and praised his use of the fictional role as a force for public good. The "<a href="South%20Wales%20Evening%20Post">South Wales Evening Post</a>" noted that Capaldi had appeared in a brief video as himself congratulating a bride on her wedding, and wrote that this video was more impressive than the previous appearance. "<a href="Metro%20%28British%20newspaper%29">Metro</a>" commented "Just when you thought Peter Capaldi couldn't possibly get any cooler, he's gone and outdone himself with this video."

"<a href="International%20Business%20Times">International Business Times</a>" reported that the video message had a significant impact on the child, in spite of its brevity, and noted in a follow-up piece that Capaldi's video was featured in headlines of multiple newspapers. "Digital Spy" followed up on its earlier favourable coverage of Capaldi's video, and chose it as the number one entry out of "7 awesome celebrity moments that will melt your heart". "<a href="Hollywood%20Life">Hollywood Life</a>" said that their journalists were moved to tears after watching the video. Their review concluded that Capaldi's message was both kind and strong, and that it was intelligent of the actor to compare the grief of Thomas to that encountered by his character on the television programme.

Capaldi's actions received favourable coverage from the "Autism Daily Newscast", an official Google News website reporting on current events and news of interest to those on the autism spectrum, with site journalist Jo Worgan noting that the actor had devoted himself while on the set of "Doctor Who" to spending time with an autistic girl who was a fan of the show. "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" noted that the <a href="Time%20Lord">Time Lord</a> character took time to support the mental well-being of a child in addition to his duties of protecting the universe from harm.

In a March 2015 interview with "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>", <a href="Peter%20Harness">Peter Harness</a>, writer of "Doctor Who" episode "<a href="Kill%20the%20Moon">Kill the Moon</a>", cited the video by Capaldi as his favourite highlight from the last ten years of the television programme. Harness explained his decision, saying that the video demonstrated Capaldi's kind demeanour and illustrated that "Doctor Who" served to assist youngsters in learning about the travails of greater society. He said that, by extension, it reminded all viewers to act with more compassion towards one another.

Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event

The Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) extinction event, also known as the Cretaceous–Tertiary (K–T) extinction, was a sudden <a href="extinction%20event">mass extinction</a> of some three-quarters of the plant and animal <a href="species">species</a> on <a href="Earth">Earth</a>, approximately 66 million years ago. With the exception of some <a href="ectotherm">ectotherm</a>ic species such as the <a href="leatherback%20sea%20turtle">leatherback sea turtle</a> and <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a>s, no <a href="tetrapod">tetrapod</a>s weighing more than survived. It marked the end of the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> period and with it, the entire <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> Era, opening the <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> Era that continues today.

In the <a href="geologic%20record">geologic record</a>, the K–Pg event is marked by a thin layer of <a href="sediment">sediment</a> called the <a href="Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene%20boundary">K–Pg boundary</a>, which can be found throughout the world in marine and terrestrial rocks. The boundary clay shows high levels of the metal <a href="iridium">iridium</a>, which is rare in the <a href="Crust%20%28geology%29%23Earth%27s%20crust">Earth's crust</a>, but abundant in <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>s.

As originally proposed in 1980 by a team of scientists led by <a href="Luis%20Walter%20Alvarez">Luis Alvarez</a> and his son <a href="Walter%20Alvarez">Walter Alvarez</a>, it is now generally thought that the K–Pg extinction was caused by the impact of a <a href="Chicxulub%20impactor">massive comet or asteroid</a> wide, 66 million years ago, which devastated the global environment, mainly through a lingering <a href="impact%20winter">impact winter</a> which halted <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> in <a href="plant">plant</a>s and <a href="plankton">plankton</a>. The impact hypothesis, also known as the <a href="Alvarez%20hypothesis">Alvarez hypothesis</a>, was bolstered by the discovery of the <a href="Chicxulub%20crater">Chicxulub crater</a> in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>'s <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a> in the early 1990s, which provided conclusive evidence that the K–Pg boundary clay represented debris from an asteroid impact. The fact that the extinctions occurred simultaneously provides strong evidence that they were caused by the asteroid. A 2016 drilling project into the <a href="Chicxulub%20crater">Chicxulub</a> <a href="peak%20ring">peak ring</a>, confirmed that the peak ring comprised <a href="granite">granite</a> ejected within minutes from deep in the earth, but contained hardly any <a href="gypsum">gypsum</a>, the usual sulfate-containing sea floor rock in the region: the gypsum would have vaporized and dispersed as an <a href="aerosol">aerosol</a> into the atmosphere, causing longer-term effects on the climate and <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a>.

Other causal or contributing factors to the extinction may have been the <a href="Deccan%20Traps">Deccan Traps</a> and other volcanic eruptions, <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>, and sea level change.

A wide range of species perished in the K–Pg extinction, the best-known being the <a href="dinosaur">non-avian dinosaur</a>s. It also destroyed a plethora of other terrestrial organisms, including certain <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s, <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>s, <a href="bird">bird</a>s, lizards, insects, and plants. In the oceans, the K–Pg extinction killed off <a href="Plesiosauria">plesiosaurs</a> and the giant marine lizards (<a href="Mosasaur">Mosasaur</a>idae) and devastated fish, <a href="shark">shark</a>s, mollusks (especially <a href="ammonites">ammonites</a>, which became extinct), and many species of plankton. It is estimated that 75% or more of all species on Earth vanished. Yet the extinction also provided evolutionary opportunities: in its wake, many groups underwent remarkable <a href="adaptive%20radiation">adaptive radiation</a>—sudden and prolific divergence into new forms and species within the disrupted and emptied ecological niches. <a href="Mammal">Mammal</a>s in particular diversified in the <a href="Paleogene">Paleogene</a>, evolving new forms such as <a href="Horse">horses</a>, <a href="Whale">whales</a>, <a href="Bat">bats</a>, and <a href="Primate">primates</a>. <a href="Bird">Birds</a>, <a href="fish">fish</a>, and perhaps <a href="Lizard">lizards</a> also radiated.

The <a href="K%E2%80%93Pg%20boundary">K–Pg boundary</a> represents one of the most dramatic turnovers in the <a href="fossil%20record">fossil record</a> for various <a href="calcareous">calcareous</a> <a href="nanoplankton">nanoplankton</a> that formed the <a href="calcium">calcium</a> deposits for which the Cretaceous is named. The turnover in this group is clearly marked at the species level. Statistical analysis of <a href="marine%20%28ocean%29">marine</a> losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by a sharp increase in extinctions than by a decrease in <a href="speciation">speciation</a>. The K–Pg boundary record of <a href="dinoflagellate">dinoflagellate</a>s is not so well understood, mainly because only <a href="microbial%20cyst">microbial cyst</a>s provide a fossil record, and not all dinoflagellate species have cyst-forming stages, which likely causes diversity to be underestimated. Recent studies indicate that there were no major shifts in dinoflagellates through the boundary layer.

 The K–Pg extinction event was severe, global, rapid, and selective, eliminating a vast number of species. Based on marine fossils, it is estimated that 75% or more of all species were made extinct.

The event appears to have affected all continents at the same time. Non-avian <a href="Dinosaur">dinosaurs</a>, for example, are known from the <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> of North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, and Antarctica, but are unknown from the Cenozoic anywhere in the world. Similarly, fossil pollen shows devastation of the plant communities in areas as far apart as <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>, <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, <a href="China">China</a>, and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>.

Despite the event's severity, there was significant variability in the rate of extinction between and within different <a href="clade">clade</a>s. Species that depended on <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked sunlight and reduced the <a href="solar%20energy">solar energy</a> reaching the ground. This plant extinction caused a major reshuffling of the dominant plant groups. <a href="Omnivores">Omnivores</a>, <a href="insectivores">insectivores</a>, and <a href="carrion">carrion</a>-eaters survived the extinction event, perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources. No purely <a href="Herbivore">herbivorous</a> or <a href="carnivore">carnivorous</a> <a href="Mammal">mammals</a> seem to have survived. Rather, the surviving <a href="Mammal">mammals</a> and birds fed on <a href="insect">insect</a>s, <a href="worm">worm</a>s, and <a href="Snail">snails</a>, which in turn fed on <a href="detritus%20%28biology%29">detritus</a> (dead plant and animal matter).

In <a href="stream">stream</a> <a href="Biocoenosis">communities</a>, few animal groups became extinct because such communities rely less directly on food from living plants and more on detritus washed in from the land, protecting them from extinction. Similar, but more complex patterns have been found in the oceans. Extinction was more severe among animals living in the <a href="Pelagic%20zone">water column</a> than among animals living on or in the sea floor. Animals in the water column are almost entirely dependent on <a href="primary%20production">primary production</a> from living <a href="phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a>, while animals on the <a href="ocean%20floor">ocean floor</a> always or sometimes feed on detritus. <a href="Coccolithophorids">Coccolithophorids</a> and <a href="mollusk">mollusk</a>s (including <a href="ammonite">ammonite</a>s, <a href="rudist">rudist</a>s, <a href="freshwater%20snail">freshwater snail</a>s, and <a href="mussel">mussel</a>s), and those organisms whose <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a> included these shell builders, became extinct or suffered heavy losses. For example, it is thought that <a href="Ammonoidea">ammonites</a> were the principal food of <a href="mosasaur">mosasaur</a>s, a group of giant marine <a href="reptiles">reptiles</a> that became extinct at the boundary. The largest air-breathing survivors of the event, <a href="crocodyliform">crocodyliform</a>s and <a href="Choristodera">champsosaurs</a>, were semi-aquatic and had access to detritus. Modern crocodilians can live as scavengers and survive for months without food, and their young are small, grow slowly, and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms for their first few years. These characteristics have been linked to crocodilian survival at the end of the Cretaceous.

After the K–Pg extinction event, biodiversity required substantial time to recover, despite the existence of abundant vacant <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>s.

<a href="Radiolaria">Radiolaria</a> have left a geological record since at least the <a href="Ordovician">Ordovician</a> times, and their mineral fossil skeletons can be tracked across the <a href="K%E2%80%93Pg%20boundary">K–Pg boundary</a>. There is no evidence of mass extinction of these organisms, and there is support for high productivity of these species in <a href="Antarctic%20Circle">southern high latitudes</a> as a result of cooling temperatures in the early <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a>. Approximately 46% of <a href="diatom">diatom</a> species survived the transition from the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> to the Upper <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a>, a significant turnover in species but not a catastrophic extinction.

The occurrence of <a href="plankton">plankton</a>ic <a href="foraminifera">foraminifera</a> across the K–Pg boundary has been studied since the 1930s. Research spurred by the possibility of an impact event at the K–Pg boundary resulted in numerous publications detailing <a href="plankton">plankton</a>ic <a href="foraminifera">foraminifera</a>l extinction at the boundary; however, there is ongoing debate between groups that think the evidence indicates substantial extinction of these species at the <a href="K%E2%80%93Pg%20boundary">K–Pg boundary</a>, and those who think the evidence supports multiple extinctions and expansions through the boundary.

Numerous species of <a href="benthic">benthic</a> foraminifera became extinct during the event, presumably because they depend on organic debris for nutrients, while <a href="biomass%20%28ecology%29">biomass</a> in the ocean is thought to have decreased. As the marine microbiota recovered, however, it is thought that increased speciation of benthic foraminifera resulted from the increase in food sources. <a href="Phytoplankton">Phytoplankton</a> recovery in the early <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a> provided the food source to support large benthic foraminiferal assemblages, which are mainly detritus-feeding. Ultimate recovery of the benthic populations occurred over several stages lasting several hundred thousand years into the early <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a>.

There is significant variation in the fossil record as to the extinction rate of <a href="marine%20invertebrates">marine invertebrates</a> across the K–Pg boundary. The apparent rate is influenced by a lack of fossil records, rather than extinctions.

<a href="Ostracod">Ostracod</a>s, a class of small <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s that were prevalent in the upper <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a>, left fossil deposits in a variety of locations. A review of these fossils shows that <a href="ostracod">ostracod</a> diversity was lower in the <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a> than any other time in the <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a>. Current research cannot ascertain, however, whether the extinctions occurred prior to, or during, the boundary interval.

Approximately 60% of late-Cretaceous <a href="Scleractinia">Scleractinia</a> <a href="coral">coral</a> genera failed to cross the K–Pg boundary into the Paleocene. Further analysis of the coral extinctions shows that approximately 98% of colonial species, ones that inhabit warm, shallow <a href="Tropics">tropical</a> waters, became extinct. The solitary corals, which generally do not form reefs and inhabit colder and deeper (below the <a href="photic%20zone">photic zone</a>) areas of the ocean were less impacted by the <a href="K%E2%80%93Pg%20boundary">K–Pg boundary</a>. Colonial coral species rely upon <a href="symbiosis">symbiosis</a> with <a href="Photosynthesis">photosynthetic</a> <a href="algae">algae</a>, which collapsed due to the events surrounding the <a href="K%E2%80%93Pg%20boundary">K–Pg boundary</a>; however, the use of data from coral fossils to support K–Pg extinction and subsequent <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a> recovery, must be weighed against the changes that occurred in coral ecosystems through the <a href="K%E2%80%93Pg%20boundary">K–Pg boundary</a>.

The numbers of <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>, <a href="echinoderm">echinoderm</a>, and <a href="Bivalvia">bivalve</a> genera exhibited significant diminution after the <a href="K%E2%80%93Pg%20boundary">K–Pg boundary</a>. Most species of <a href="brachiopods">brachiopods</a>, a small <a href="phylum">phylum</a> of <a href="Marine%20invertebrates">marine invertebrates</a>, survived the K–Pg extinction event and diversified during the early <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a>.
Except for <a href="nautiloid">nautiloid</a>s (represented by the modern order <a href="Nautilida">Nautilida</a>) and <a href="Coleoidea">coleoids</a> (which had already <a href="Genetic%20divergence">diverged</a> into modern <a href="octopus">octopodes</a>, <a href="squid">squid</a>s, and <a href="cuttlefish">cuttlefish</a>) all other species of the <a href="mollusca">mollusca</a>n class <a href="Cephalopod">Cephalopod</a>a became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. These included the ecologically significant <a href="belemnoidea">belemnoids</a>, as well as the <a href="Ammonoidea">ammonoids</a>, a group of highly diverse, numerous, and widely distributed shelled <a href="Cephalopod">cephalopods</a>. Researchers have pointed out that the reproductive strategy of the surviving <a href="Nautiloid">nautiloids</a>, which rely upon few and larger eggs, played a role in outsurviving their <a href="Ammonoidea">ammonoid</a> counterparts through the extinction event. The <a href="Ammonoidea">ammonoids</a> utilized a planktonic strategy of reproduction (numerous eggs and planktonic larvae), which would have been devastated by the K–Pg extinction event. Additional research has shown that subsequent to this elimination of ammonoids from the global biota, <a href="Nautiloid">nautiloids</a> began an evolutionary radiation into shell shapes and complexities theretofore known only from ammonoids.

Approximately 35% of <a href="echinoderm">echinoderm</a> genera became extinct at the <a href="Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene%20boundary">K–Pg boundary</a>, although <a href="taxon">taxa</a> that thrived in low-latitude, shallow-water environments during the late Cretaceous had the highest extinction rate. Mid-latitude, deep-water echinoderms were much less affected at the <a href="Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene%20boundary">K–Pg boundary</a>. The pattern of extinction points to habitat loss, specifically the drowning of <a href="carbonate%20platform">carbonate platform</a>s, the shallow-water reefs in existence at that time, by the extinction event.

Other invertebrate groups, including <a href="rudists">rudists</a> (reef-building clams) and <a href="inoceramus">inoceramids</a> (giant relatives of modern <a href="scallop">scallop</a>s), also became extinct at the <a href="K%E2%80%93Pg%20boundary">K–Pg boundary</a>.

There are substantial fossil records of <a href="Gnathostomata">jawed fishes</a> across the <a href="K%E2%80%93Pg%20boundary">K–Pg boundary</a>, which provide good evidence of extinction patterns of these classes of marine vertebrates. While the deep sea realm was able to remain seemingly unaffected, there was an equal loss between the open marine apex predators and the <a href="durophagous">durophagous</a> <a href="demersal">demersal</a> feeders on the continental shelf.

Within <a href="Chondrichthyes">cartilaginous fish</a>, approximately 7 out of the 41 families of <a href="Neoselachii">neoselachians</a> (modern <a href="sharks">sharks</a>, skates, and rays) disappeared after this event and <a href="Batoidea">batoids</a> (skates and rays) lost nearly all the identifiable species, while more than 90% of <a href="teleostei">teleost fish</a> (bony fish) families survived.

In the <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> age, 28 <a href="shark">shark</a> families and 13 <a href="Batoidea">batoid</a> families thrived, of which 25 and 9, respectively, survived the K–T boundary event. Forty-seven of all <a href="Neoselachii">neoselachian</a> genera cross the K–T boundary, with 85% being sharks. <a href="Batoidea">Batoids</a> display with 15% a comparably low survival rate.

There is evidence of a mass extinction of <a href="Osteichthyes">bony fishes</a> at a fossil site immediately above the <a href="K%E2%80%93Pg%20boundary">K–Pg boundary</a> layer on <a href="Seymour%20Island">Seymour Island</a> near <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, apparently precipitated by the K–Pg extinction event; however, the marine and freshwater environments of fishes mitigated environmental effects of the extinction event.

<a href="Insect">Insect</a> damage to the fossilized leaves of <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a>s from fourteen sites in North America was used as a proxy for insect diversity across the K–Pg boundary and analyzed to determine the rate of extinction. Researchers found that Cretaceous sites, prior to the extinction event, had rich plant and insect-feeding diversity. During the early Paleocene, however, flora were relatively diverse with little predation from insects, even 1.7 million years after the extinction event.

There is overwhelming evidence of global disruption of plant communities at the K–Pg boundary. Extinctions are seen both in studies of fossil pollen, and fossil leaves. In North America, the data suggests massive devastation and mass extinction of plants at the K–Pg boundary sections, although there were substantial megafloral changes before the boundary. In North America, approximately 57% of plant species became extinct. In high southern hemisphere latitudes, such as New Zealand and Antarctica, the mass die-off of flora caused no significant turnover in species, but dramatic and short-term changes in the relative abundance of plant groups. In some regions, the Paleocene recovery of plants began with recolonizations by fern species, represented as a <a href="fern%20spike">fern spike</a> in the geologic record; this same pattern of fern recolonization was observed after the <a href="1980%20eruption%20of%20Mount%20St.%20Helens">1980 Mount St. Helens eruption</a>.

Due to the wholesale destruction of plants at the K–Pg boundary, there was a proliferation of <a href="Saprotrophic%20nutrition">saprotrophic</a> organisms, such as <a href="fungus">fungi</a>, that do not require <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> and use nutrients from decaying vegetation. The dominance of fungal species lasted only a few years while the atmosphere cleared and plenty of organic matter to feed on was present. Once the atmosphere cleared, photosynthetic organisms, initially ferns and other ground-level plants, returned. Just two species of fern appear to have dominated the landscape for centuries after the event.

<a href="Polyploidy">Polyploidy</a> appears to have enhanced the ability of flowering plants to survive the extinction, probably because the additional copies of the genome such plants possessed, allowed them to more readily adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions that followed the impact.

There is limited evidence for extinction of amphibians at the <a href="K%E2%80%93Pg%20boundary">K–Pg boundary</a>. A study of fossil vertebrates across the K–Pg boundary in <a href="Montana">Montana</a> concluded that no species of amphibian became extinct. Yet there are several species of <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> amphibian, not included as part of this study, which are unknown from the Paleocene. These include the frog "<a href="Theatonius">Theatonius lancensis</a>" and the <a href="Albanerpetontidae">albanerpetontid</a> "<a href="Albanerpeton">Albanerpeton galaktion</a>"; therefore, some amphibians do seem to have become extinct at the boundary. The relatively low levels of extinction seen among amphibians probably reflect the low extinction rates seen in freshwater animals.

The <a href="Choristodera">choristoderes</a> (<a href="Semiaquatic">semi-aquatic</a> <a href="Archosauromorpha">archosauromorphs</a>) survived across the K–Pg boundary but would die out in the early <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>. Studies on "<a href="Champsosaurus">Champsosaurus</a>" palatal teeth suggest that there were dietary changes among the various species across the KT event.

More than 80% of <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> <a href="turtle">turtle</a> species passed through the K–Pg boundary. Additionally, all six turtle families in existence at the end of the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> survived into the <a href="Paleogene">Paleogene</a> and are represented by living species.

The living non-<a href="archosaur">archosaur</a>ian reptile taxa, <a href="lepidosauria">lepidosauria</a>ns (<a href="Squamata">lizards</a> and <a href="tuatara">tuatara</a>s), survived across the K–Pg boundary. Living <a href="Lepidosauria">lepidosaurs</a> include the <a href="Tuatara">tuataras</a> (the only living <a href="rhynchocephalia">rhynchocephalia</a>ns) and the <a href="Squamata">squamates</a>.

The <a href="Rhynchocephalia">rhynchocephalians</a> were a widespread and relatively successful group of <a href="Lepidosauria">lepidosaurians</a> during the early <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a>, but began to decline by the mid-Cretaceous, although they were very successful in the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> of <a href="South%20America">South America</a>. They are represented today by a single genus, located exclusively in <a href="Biodiversity%20of%20New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>.

The order <a href="Squamata">Squamata</a>, which is represented today by lizards, including snakes and amphisbaenians (worm lizards), radiated into various ecological niches during the <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> and was successful throughout the Cretaceous. They survived through the K–Pg boundary and are currently the most successful and diverse group of living reptiles, with more than 6,000 extant species. Many families of terrestrial squamates became extinct at the boundary, such as <a href="monstersauria">monstersauria</a>ns and <a href="Polyglyphanodontia">polyglyphanodonts</a>, and fossil evidence indicates they suffered very heavy losses in the K–T event, only recovering 10 million years after it. Giant non-<a href="Archosaur">archosaurian</a> <a href="Marine%20reptiles">aquatic reptiles</a> such as <a href="mosasaur">mosasaur</a>s and <a href="Plesiosauria">plesiosaurs</a>, which were the top marine predators of their time, became extinct by the end of the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>. The <a href="ichthyosaur">ichthyosaur</a>s had disappeared from fossil records before the mass extinction occurred.

The <a href="archosaur">archosaur</a> <a href="clade">clade</a> includes two surviving groups, <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>ns and <a href="bird">bird</a>s, along with the various extinct groups of non-avian <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s and <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>s.

Ten families of <a href="Crocodilia">crocodilians</a> or their close relatives are represented in the <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> fossil records, of which five died out prior to the K–Pg boundary. Five families have both <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> and <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a> fossil representatives. All of the surviving families of <a href="Crocodyliformes">crocodyliforms</a> inhabited freshwater and terrestrial environments—except for the <a href="Dyrosauridae">Dyrosauridae</a>, which lived in freshwater and marine locations. Approximately 50% of <a href="Crocodyliformes">crocodyliform</a> representatives survived across the K–Pg boundary, the only apparent trend being that no large crocodiles survived. <a href="Crocodyliformes">Crocodyliform</a> survivability across the boundary may have resulted from their aquatic niche and ability to burrow, which reduced susceptibility to negative environmental effects at the boundary. Jouve and colleagues suggested in 2008 that juvenile marine <a href="Crocodyliformes">crocodyliforms</a> lived in freshwater environments as do modern marine <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a> juveniles, which would have helped them survive where other <a href="Marine%20reptile">marine reptiles</a> became extinct; freshwater environments were not so strongly affected by the K–Pg extinction event as marine environments were.

One family of <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>s, <a href="Azhdarchidae">Azhdarchidae</a>, was definitely present in the <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a>, and it likely became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. These large <a href="Pterosaur">pterosaurs</a> were the last representatives of a declining group that contained ten families during the mid-Cretaceous. Several other pterosaur lineages may have been present during the Maastrichtian, such as the <a href="Eupterodactyloidea">ornithocheirids</a>, <a href="Pteranodontidae">pteranodontids</a>, <a href="Nyctosauridae">nyctosaurids</a>, as well as, a possible <a href="Tapejaridae">tapejarid</a>, though they are represented by fragmentary remains that are difficult to assign to any given group. While this was occurring, modern <a href="bird">bird</a>s were undergoing diversification; traditionally it was thought that they replaced archaic birds and pterosaur groups, possibly due to direct competition, or they simply filled empty niches, but there is no correlation between pterosaur and avian diversities that are conclusive to a competition hypothesis, and small pterosaurs were present in the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a>. In fact, at least some niches previously held by <a href="Bird">birds</a> were reclaimed by <a href="Pterosaur">pterosaurs</a> prior to the K–Pg event.

Most <a href="Paleontology">paleontologists</a> regard birds as the only surviving dinosaurs (see <a href="Origin%20of%20birds">Origin of birds</a>). It is thought that all non-avian <a href="Theropoda">theropods</a> became extinct, including then-flourishing groups such as <a href="enantiornithes">enantiornithines</a> and <a href="hesperornithes">hesperornithiforms</a>. Several analyses of bird fossils show divergence of species prior to the K–Pg boundary, and that duck, chicken, and <a href="ratite">ratite</a> bird relatives coexisted with non-avian dinosaurs. Large collections of bird fossils representing a range of different species provides definitive evidence for the persistence of archaic birds to within 300,000 years of the K–Pg boundary. The absence of these birds in the Paleogene is evidence that a mass extinction of archaic birds took place there. A small fraction of the Cretaceous bird species survived the impact, giving rise to today's birds. The only bird group known for certain to have survived the K–Pg boundary is the Aves. Avians may have been able to survive the extinction as a result of their abilities to dive, swim, or seek shelter in water and marshlands. Many species of avians can build burrows, or nest in tree holes or termite nests, all of which provided shelter from the environmental effects at the K–Pg boundary. Long-term survival past the boundary was assured as a result of filling ecological niches left empty by extinction of non-avian dinosaurs.

Excluding a <a href="Paleocene%20dinosaurs">few controversial claims</a>, scientists agree that all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. The dinosaur fossil record has been interpreted to show both a decline in diversity and no decline in diversity during the last few million years of the Cretaceous, and it may be that the quality of the dinosaur fossil record is simply not good enough to permit researchers to distinguish between the options. There is no evidence that late Maastrichtian non-avian dinosaurs could burrow, swim, or dive, which suggests they were unable to shelter themselves from the worst parts of any environmental stress that occurred at the K–Pg boundary. It is possible that small dinosaurs (other than birds) did survive, but they would have been deprived of food, as herbivorous dinosaurs would have found plant material scarce and carnivores would have quickly found prey in short supply.

The growing consensus about the endothermy of dinosaurs (see <a href="physiology%20of%20dinosaurs">dinosaur physiology</a>) helps to understand their full extinction in contrast with their close relatives, the <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>ns. Ectothermic ("cold-blooded") crocodiles have very limited needs for food (they can survive several months without eating) while endothermic ("warm-blooded") animals of similar size need much more food to sustain their faster metabolism. Thus, under the circumstances of food chain disruption previously mentioned, non-avian dinosaurs died, while some crocodiles survived. In this context, the survival of other endothermic animals, such as some birds and mammals, could be due, among other reasons, to their smaller needs for food, related to their small size at the extinction epoch.

Whether the extinction occurred gradually or suddenly has been debated, as both views have support from the fossil record. A study of 29 fossil sites in Catalan <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> of Europe in 2010 supports the view that dinosaurs there had great diversity until the asteroid impact, with more than 100 living species. More recent research indicates that this figure is obscured by taphonomical biases, however, and the sparsity of the continental fossil record. The results of this study, which were based on estimated real global biodiversity, showed that between 628 and 1,078 non-avian dinosaur species were alive at the end of the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> and underwent sudden extinction after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Alternatively, interpretation based on the fossil-bearing rocks along the <a href="Red%20Deer%20River">Red Deer River</a> in Alberta, Canada, supports the gradual extinction of non-avian dinosaurs; during the last 10 million years of the Cretaceous layers there, the number of dinosaur species seems to have decreased from about 45 to approximately 12. Other scientists have made the same assessment following their research.

Several researchers support the existence of <a href="Paleocene%20dinosaurs">Paleocene non-avian dinosaurs</a>. Evidence of this existence is based on the discovery of dinosaur remains in the <a href="Hell%20Creek%20Formation">Hell Creek Formation</a> up to above and 40,000 years later than the K–Pg boundary. Pollen samples recovered near a fossilized <a href="hadrosaur">hadrosaur</a> <a href="femur">femur</a> recovered in the <a href="Ojo%20Alamo%20Formation">Ojo Alamo Sandstone</a> at the <a href="San%20Juan%20River%20%28Colorado%20River%20tributary%29">San Juan River</a> in Colorado, indicate that the animal lived during the Cenozoic, approximately (about 1 million years after the K–Pg extinction event). If their existence past the K–Pg boundary can be confirmed, these hadrosaurids would be considered a <a href="Extinction%20debt">dead clade walking</a>. Scientific consensus, however, is that these fossils were eroded from their original locations and then re-buried in much later sediments (also known as reworked fossils).

All major Cretaceous <a href="mammal">mammal</a>ian lineages, including <a href="monotreme">monotreme</a>s (egg-laying mammals), <a href="multituberculata">multituberculates</a>, <a href="metatheria">metatheria</a>ns, <a href="eutheria">eutheria</a>ns, <a href="dryolestoidea">dryolestoidea</a>ns, and <a href="gondwanatheria">gondwanatheres</a> survived the K–Pg extinction event, although they suffered losses. In particular, metatherians largely disappeared from North America, and the Asian <a href="deltatheroida">deltatheroida</a>ns became extinct (aside from the lineage leading to "<a href="Gurbanodelta">Gurbanodelta</a>"). In the Hell Creek beds of North America, at least half of the ten known multituberculate species and all eleven metatherians species, are not found above the boundary. Multituberculates in Europe and North America survived relatively unscathed and quickly bounced back in the Palaeocene, but Asian forms were decimated, never again to represent a significant component on mammalian faunas. A recent study indicates that metatherians suffered the heaviest losses at the K–T event, followed by multituberculates, while eutherians recovered the quickest.

Mammalian species began diversifying approximately 30 million years prior to the K–Pg boundary. Diversification of mammals stalled across the boundary.
Current research indicates that mammals did not explosively diversify across the K–Pg boundary, despite the environment niches made available by the extinction of dinosaurs. Several mammalian orders have been interpreted as diversifying immediately after the K–Pg boundary, including Chiroptera (<a href="bat">bat</a>s) and Cetartiodactyla (a diverse group that today includes <a href="cetaceans">whales and dolphins</a> and <a href="even-toed%20ungulate">even-toed ungulate</a>s), although recent research concludes that only <a href="marsupial">marsupial</a> orders diversified after the K–Pg boundary.

K–Pg boundary mammalian species were generally small, comparable in size to <a href="rat">rat</a>s; this small size would have helped them find shelter in protected environments. In addition, it is postulated that some early monotremes, marsupials, and placentals were semiaquatic or burrowing, as there are multiple mammalian lineages with such habits today. Any burrowing or semiaquatic mammal would have had additional protection from K–Pg boundary environmental stresses.

In North American terrestrial sequences, the extinction event is best represented by the marked discrepancy between the rich and relatively abundant late-Maastrichtian <a href="palynomorph">palynomorph</a> record and the post-boundary fern spike.

At present the most informative sequence of dinosaur-bearing rocks in the world from the K–Pg boundary is found in western North America, particularly the late <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a>-age <a href="Hell%20Creek%20Formation">Hell Creek Formation</a> of <a href="Montana">Montana</a>. Comparison with the older <a href="Judith%20River%20Formation">Judith River Formation</a> (<a href="Montana">Montana</a>) and <a href="Dinosaur%20Park%20Formation">Dinosaur Park Formation</a> (<a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>), which both date from approximately 75 Ma, provides information on the changes in dinosaur populations over the last 10 million years of the Cretaceous. However, these fossil beds are geographically limited, covering only part of one continent.

The middle–late Campanian formations show a greater diversity of dinosaurs than any other single group of rocks. The late Maastrichtian rocks contain the largest members of several major clades: "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>", "<a href="Ankylosaurus">Ankylosaurus</a>", "<a href="Pachycephalosaurus">Pachycephalosaurus</a>", "<a href="Triceratops">Triceratops</a>", and "<a href="Torosaurus">Torosaurus</a>", which suggests food was plentiful immediately prior to the extinction.

In addition to rich dinosaur fossils, there are also plant fossils that illustrate the reduction in plant species across the K–Pg boundary. In the sediments below the K–Pg boundary the dominant plant remains are <a href="Flowering%20plant">angiosperm</a> pollen grains, but the boundary layer contains little pollen and is dominated by fern spores. More usual pollen levels gradually resume above the boundary layer. This is reminiscent of areas blighted by modern volcanic eruptions, where the recovery is led by ferns, which are later replaced by larger angiosperm plants.

The mass extinction of marine plankton appears to have been abrupt and right at the K–Pg boundary. <a href="Ammonite">Ammonite</a> genera became extinct at or near the K–Pg boundary; however, there was a smaller and slower extinction of ammonite genera prior to the boundary that was associated with a late Cretaceous marine regression. The gradual extinction of most inoceramid bivalves began well before the K–Pg boundary, and a small, gradual reduction in ammonite diversity occurred throughout the very late Cretaceous.

Further analysis shows that several processes were in progress in the late Cretaceous seas and partially overlapped in time, then ended with the abrupt mass extinction. The diversity of marine life decreased when the climate near the K–Pg boundary increased in temperature. The temperature increased about three to four degrees very rapidly between 65.4 and 65.2 million years ago, which is very near the time of the extinction event. Not only did the climate temperature increase, but the water temperature decreased, causing a drastic decrease in marine diversity.

The scientific consensus is that the asteroid impact at the K–Pg boundary left <a href="megatsunami">megatsunami</a> deposits and sediments around the area of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, from the colossal waves created by the impact. These deposits have been identified in the La Popa basin in northeastern <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="Carbonate%20platform">platform carbonates</a> in northeastern Brazil, in Atlantic deep-sea sediments, and in the form of the thickest-known layer of graded sand deposits, around , in the Chicxulub crater itself, directly above the shocked granite ejecta.

The <a href="megatsunami">megatsunami</a> has been estimated at more than tall, as the asteroid fell into relatively shallow seas; in deep seas it would have been tall.

The rapidity of the extinction is a controversial issue, because some theories about the <a href="extinction">extinction</a>'s causes imply a rapid extinction over a relatively short period (from a few years to a few thousand years) while others imply longer periods. The issue is difficult to resolve because of the <a href="Signor%E2%80%93Lipps%20effect">Signor–Lipps effect</a>; that is, the fossil record is so incomplete that most extinct <a href="species">species</a> probably died out long after the most recent fossil that has been found. Scientists have also found very few continuous beds of fossil-bearing rock that cover a time range from several million years before the K–Pg extinction to a few million years after it. The sedimentation rate and thickness of K–Pg clay from three sites suggest rapid extinction, perhaps less than ten thousand years. At one site in the Denver Basin of Colorado, the 'fern spike' lasted about one thousand years (no more than 71 thousand years); the earliest Cenozoic mammals appeared about 185,000 years (no more than 570,000 years) after the K–Pg boundary layer was deposited.

In 1980, a team of researchers consisting of <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a>-winning physicist <a href="Luis%20Walter%20Alvarez">Luis Alvarez</a>, his son, geologist <a href="Walter%20Alvarez">Walter Alvarez</a>, and chemists <a href="Frank%20Asaro">Frank Asaro</a> and <a href="Helen%20Michel">Helen Michel</a> discovered that <a href="Sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary</a> layers found all over the world at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary contain a <a href="concentration">concentration</a> of <a href="iridium">iridium</a> many times greater than normal (30, 160, and 20 times in three sections originally studied). Iridium is extremely rare in <a href="crust%20%28geology%29">Earth's crust</a> because it is a <a href="Goldschmidt%20classification%23Siderophile%20elements">siderophile element</a> which mostly sank along with <a href="iron">iron</a> into <a href="Structure%20of%20the%20Earth%23Core">Earth's core</a> during <a href="planetary%20differentiation">planetary differentiation</a>. As iridium remains abundant in most <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>s and <a href="comet">comet</a>s, the Alvarez team suggested that an asteroid struck the Earth at the time of the K–Pg boundary. There were earlier speculations on the possibility of an <a href="impact%20event">impact event</a>, but this was the first hard evidence.

This hypothesis was viewed as radical when first proposed, but additional evidence soon emerged. The boundary clay was found to be full of minute spherules of rock, crystallized from droplets of molten rock formed by the impact. <a href="Shocked%20quartz">Shocked quartz</a> and other minerals were also identified in the K–Pg boundary. The identification of giant <a href="Tsunami%20deposit">tsunami beds</a> along the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean provided more evidence, and suggested that the impact may have occurred nearby—as did the discovery that the K–Pg boundary became thicker in the southern United States, with meter-thick beds of debris occurring in northern New Mexico.
Further research identified the giant <a href="Chicxulub%20crater">Chicxulub crater</a>, buried under <a href="Chicxulub%2C%20Yucat%C3%A1n">Chicxulub</a> on the coast of <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán</a>, as the source of the K–Pg boundary clay. Identified in 1990 based on work by geophysicist Glen Penfield in 1978, the crater is oval, with an average diameter of roughly , about the size calculated by the Alvarez team. The discovery of the crater—a prediction of the impact hypothesis—provided conclusive evidence for a K–Pg impact, and strengthened the hypothesis that it caused the extinction.

In a 2013 paper, <a href="Paul%20Renne">Paul Renne</a> of the <a href="Berkeley%20Geochronology%20Center">Berkeley Geochronology Center</a> dated the impact at million years ago, based on <a href="argon%E2%80%93argon%20dating">argon–argon dating</a>. He further posits that the mass extinction occurred within 32,000 years of this date.

In 2007, it was proposed that the impactor belonged to the <a href="Baptistina%20family">Baptistina family</a> of asteroids. This link has been doubted, though not disproved, in part because of a lack of observations of the asteroid and its family. It was recently discovered that 298 Baptistina does not share the chemical signature of the K–Pg impactor. Further, a 2011 <a href="Wide-field%20Infrared%20Survey%20Explorer">Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer</a> (WISE) study of reflected light from the asteroids of the family estimated their break-up at 80 Ma, giving them insufficient time to shift orbits and impact Earth by 66 Ma.

In , an international panel of 41 scientists reviewed 20 years of scientific literature and endorsed the asteroid hypothesis, specifically the Chicxulub impact, as the cause of the extinction, ruling out other theories such as massive <a href="volcanism">volcanism</a>. They had determined that a asteroid hurtled into Earth at <a href="Chicxulub%2C%20Yucat%C3%A1n">Chicxulub</a> on Mexico's <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a>. The collision would have released the same energy as —more than a billion times the energy of the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a>.

The Chicxulub impact caused a global catastrophe. Some of the phenomena were brief occurrences immediately following the impact, but there were also long-term geochemical and climatic disruptions that devastated the ecology.

The re-entry of ejecta into Earth's atmosphere would include a brief (hours-long) but intense pulse of <a href="infrared">infrared radiation</a>, cooking exposed organisms. A paper in 2013 by a prominent modeler of <a href="nuclear%20winter">nuclear winter</a> suggested that, based on the amount of soot in the global debris layer, the entire terrestrial <a href="biosphere">biosphere</a> might have burned, implying a global soot-cloud blocking out the sun and creating a <a href="impact%20winter">impact winter</a> effect. This is debated, however, with opponents arguing that local ferocious fires, probably limited to North America, fall short of global <a href="firestorm">firestorm</a>s. This is the "<a href="nuclear%20winter%23Potential%20climatic%20precedents">Cretaceous–Palaeogene firestorm debate</a>".

Aside from the hypothesized fire and/or impact winter effects, the impact would have created a dust cloud that blocked sunlight for up to a year, inhibiting photosynthesis. The asteroid hit an area of carbonate rock containing a large amount of combustible hydrocarbons and sulphur, much of which was vaporized, thereby injecting <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a> <a href="aerosol">aerosol</a>s into the <a href="stratosphere">stratosphere</a>, which might have reduced sunlight reaching the Earth's surface by more than 50%, and would have caused acid rain. The resulting acidification of the oceans would kill many organisms that grow shells of <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a>. At Brazos section, the sea surface temperature dropped as much as for decades after the impact. It would take at least ten years for such aerosols to dissipate, and would account for the extinction of <a href="plant">plant</a>s and <a href="phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a>, and subsequently <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a>s and their <a href="Predation">predators</a>. Creatures whose food chains were based on <a href="detritus">detritus</a> would have a reasonable chance of survival, however. Freezing temperatures probably lasted for at least three years.

If widespread fires occurred, they would have increased the content of the atmosphere and caused a temporary <a href="greenhouse%20effect">greenhouse effect</a> once the dust clouds and aerosol settled, and, this would have exterminated the most vulnerable organisms that survived the period immediately after the impact.

Although most paleontologists now agree that an asteroid did hit the Earth at approximately the end of the Cretaceous, there is an ongoing dispute whether the impact was the sole cause of the extinctions.

In 2016, a scientific drilling project obtained deep rock-<a href="core%20sample">core sample</a>s from the <a href="Peak%20ring%20%28crater%29">peak ring</a> around the <a href="Chicxulub%20crater">Chicxulub impact crater</a>. The discoveries confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had been shocked by immense pressure and melted in just minutes from its usual state into its present form. Unlike sea-floor deposits, the peak ring was made of granite originating much deeper in the earth, which had been ejected to the surface by the impact. <a href="Gypsum">Gypsum</a> is a <a href="sulfate">sulfate</a>-containing rock usually present in the shallow seabed of the region; it had been almost entirely removed, vaporized into the atmosphere. Further, the event was immediately followed by a <a href="megatsunami">megatsunami</a> sufficient to lay down the largest known layer of sand separated by grain size directly above the peak ring.

These findings strongly support the impact's role in the extinction event. The impactor was large enough to create a peak ring, to melt, shock, and eject deep granite, to create colossal water movements, and to eject an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere, where they would have persisted for a long time. This worldwide dispersal of dust and sulfates would have affected climate catastrophically, led to large temperature drops, and devastated the <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a>.

Although the concurrence of the end-Cretaceous extinctions with the Chicxulub asteroid impact strongly supports the impact hypothesis, some scientists continue to support other contributing causes: volcanic eruptions, climate change, sea level change, and other impact events. The end-Cretaceous event is the only <a href="Extinction%20event">mass extinction</a> known to be associated with an impact, and other large impacts, such as the <a href="Manicouagan%20Reservoir">Manicouagan Reservoir</a> impact, do not coincide with any noticeable extinction events.

Before 2000, arguments that the <a href="Deccan%20Traps">Deccan Traps</a> <a href="flood%20basalt">flood basalt</a>s caused the extinction were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68 Mya and lasted more than 2 million years. The most recent evidence shows that the traps erupted over a period of only 800,000 years spanning the K–Pg boundary, and therefore may be responsible for the extinction and the delayed biotic recovery thereafter.

The Deccan Traps could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulfuric aerosols into the air, which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions that increased the <a href="greenhouse%20effect">greenhouse effect</a> when the dust and <a href="aerosol">aerosol</a>s cleared from the atmosphere.

In the years when the Deccan Traps hypothesis was linked to a slower extinction, Luis Alvarez (d. 1988) replied that <a href="Paleontology">paleontologists</a> were being misled by <a href="Signor%E2%80%93Lipps%20effect">sparse data</a>. While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. Even Walter Alvarez acknowledged that other major changes may have contributed to the extinctions.

Combining these theories, some geophysical models suggest that the impact contributed to the Deccan Traps.
These models, combined with high-precision radiometric dating, suggest that the Chicxulub impact could have triggered some of the largest Deccan eruptions, as well as eruptions at active volcanoes anywhere on Earth.

Other crater-like topographic features have also been proposed as impact craters formed in connection with Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction. This suggests the possibility of near-simultaneous multiple impacts, perhaps from a fragmented asteroidal object similar to the <a href="Comet%20Shoemaker%E2%80%93Levy%209">Shoemaker–Levy 9</a> impact with <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. In addition to the <a href="Chicxulub%20crater">Chicxulub crater</a>, there is the <a href="Boltysh%20crater">Boltysh crater</a> in <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> (), the <a href="Silverpit%20crater">Silverpit crater</a> in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> () possibly formed by <a href="bolide">bolide</a> impact, and the controversial and much larger <a href="Shiva%20crater">Shiva crater</a>. Any other craters that might have formed in the <a href="Tethys%20Ocean">Tethys Ocean</a> would have been obscured by the northward tectonic drift of Africa and India.

There is clear evidence that sea levels fell in the final stage of the Cretaceous by more than at any other time in the <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> era. In some <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> <a href="Stage%20%28stratigraphy%29">stage</a> rock layers from various parts of the world, the later layers are terrestrial; earlier layers represent shorelines and the earliest layers represent seabeds. These layers do not show the tilting and distortion associated with <a href="Orogeny">mountain building</a>, therefore the likeliest explanation is a "regression", a drop in sea level. There is no direct evidence for the cause of the regression, but the currently accepted explanation is that the <a href="plate%20tectonics">mid-ocean ridges</a> became less active and sank under their own weight.

A severe regression would have greatly reduced the <a href="continental%20shelf">continental shelf</a> area, the most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a "marine" mass extinction; however, this change would not have sufficed to cause the extinction of the ammonites. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's <a href="albedo">albedo</a> and increasing global temperatures.

Marine regression also resulted in the loss of <a href="Inland%20sea%20%28geology%29">epeiric seas</a>, such as the <a href="Western%20Interior%20Seaway">Western Interior Seaway</a> of North America. The loss of these seas greatly altered habitats, removing <a href="coastal%20plain">coastal plain</a>s that ten million years before had been host to diverse communities such as are found in rocks of the <a href="Dinosaur%20Park%20Formation">Dinosaur Park Formation</a>. Another consequence was an expansion of <a href="Fresh%20water">freshwater</a> environments, since continental runoff now had longer distances to travel before reaching <a href="ocean">ocean</a>s. While this change was favorable to freshwater <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s, those that prefer marine environments, such as <a href="shark">shark</a>s, suffered.

Proponents of multiple causation view the suggested single causes as either too small to produce the vast scale of the extinction, or not likely to produce its observed taxonomic pattern. In a review article, J. David Archibald and David E. Fastovsky discussed a scenario combining three major postulated causes: <a href="volcanism">volcanism</a>, <a href="marine%20regression">marine regression</a>, and extraterrestrial impact. In this scenario, terrestrial and marine communities were stressed by the changes in, and loss of, habitats. Dinosaurs, as the largest vertebrates, were the first affected by environmental changes, and their diversity declined. At the same time, <a href="Particle">particulate</a> materials from volcanism cooled and dried areas of the globe. Then an impact event occurred, causing collapses in photosynthesis-based food chains, both in the already-stressed terrestrial food chains and in the marine food chains.

Recent work led by Sierra Peterson at Seymour Island, Antarctica, showed two separate extinction events near the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, with one correlating to Deccan Trap volcanism and one correlated with the Chicxulub impact. The team analyzed combined extinction patterns using a new clumped isotope temperature record from a hiatus-free, expanded K–Pg boundary section. They documented a 7.8±3.3 °C warming synchronous with the onset of Deccan Traps volcanism and a second, smaller warming at the time of meteorite impact. They suggest local warming may have been amplified due to simultaneous disappearance of continental or sea ice. Intra-shell variability indicates a possible reduction in seasonality after Deccan eruptions began, continuing through the meteorite event. Species extinction at Seymour Island occurred in two pulses that coincide with the two observed warming events, directly linking the end-Cretaceous extinction at this site to both volcanic and meteorite events via climate change.

The K–Pg extinction had a profound effect on the <a href="Timeline%20of%20the%20evolutionary%20history%20of%20life">evolution of life on Earth</a>. The elimination of dominant Cretaceous groups allowed other organisms to take their place, spurring a remarkable series of <a href="adaptive%20radiation">adaptive radiation</a>s in the Paleogene. The most striking example is the replacement of dinosaurs by mammals. After the K–Pg extinction, mammals evolved rapidly to fill the niches left vacant by the dinosaurs. Also significant, within the mammalian genera, new species were approximately 9.1% larger after the K–Pg boundary.

Other groups also underwent major radiations. Based on molecular sequencing and fossil dating, <a href="Neoaves">Neoaves</a> appeared to radiate after the K–Pg boundary. They even produced giant, flightless forms, such as the herbivorous "<a href="Gastornis">Gastornis</a>" and <a href="Dromornithidae">Dromornithidae</a>, and the predatory <a href="Phorusrhacidae">Phorusrhacidae</a>. The extinction of Cretaceous lizards and snakes may have led to the radiation of modern groups such as iguanas, monitor lizards, and boas. On land, <a href="Titanoboa">giant boid</a> and enormous <a href="Madtsoiidae">madtsoiid</a> snakes appeared, and in the seas, giant <a href="sea%20snakes">sea snakes</a> radiated. Teleost fish diversified explosively, filling the niches left vacant by the extinction. Groups appearing in the Paleocene and Eocene include billfish, tunas, eels, and flatfish. Major changes are also seen in Paleogene insect communities. Many groups of ants were present in the Cretaceous, but in the Eocene ants became dominant and diverse, with larger colonies. Butterflies diversified as well, perhaps to take the place of leaf-eating insects wiped out by the extinction. The advanced mound-building termites, <a href="Termitidae">Termitidae</a>, also appear to have risen in importance.

HMS Emerald (1795)

HMS Emerald was a 36-gun <a href="frigate">frigate</a> that Sir William Rule designed in 1794 for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. The <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> ordered her construction towards the end of May 1794 and work began the following month at <a href="Northfleet">Northfleet</a> dockyard. She was completed on 12 October 1795 and joined <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="John%20Jervis%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20St%20Vincent">John Jervis's</a> fleet in the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>.

In 1797, "Emerald" was one of several vessels sent to hunt down and capture the crippled <a href="Spanish%20ship%20Nuestra%20Se%C3%B1ora%20de%20la%20Sant%C3%ADsima%20Trinidad">Santisima Trinidad</a>, which had escaped from the British at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20St%20Vincent%20%281797%29">Battle of Cape St Vincent</a>. "Emerald" was supposed to have been present at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Nile">Battle of the Nile</a> but in May 1798 a storm separated her from <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson">Horatio Nelson</a>'s <a href="Squadron%20%28naval%29">squadron</a> and she arrived in <a href="Abu%20Qir%20Bay">Aboukir Bay</a> nine days too late. She was part of Rear-Admiral <a href="Sir%20John%20Duckworth%2C%201st%20Baronet">John Thomas Duckworth's</a> squadron during the <a href="Action%20of%207%20April%201800">Action of 7 April 1800</a> off <a href="Cadiz">Cadiz</a>.

"Emerald" served in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> throughout 1803 in <a href="Samuel%20Hood%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Hood">Samuel Hood</a>'s fleet, then took part in the invasion of <a href="St%20Lucia">St Lucia</a> in July, and of <a href="Suriname">Surinam</a> the following spring. Returning to home waters for repairs in 1806, she served in the <a href="western%20approaches">western approaches</a> before joining a fleet under Admiral <a href="James%20Gambier%2C%201st%20Baron%20Gambier">James Gambier</a> in 1809, and taking part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Basque%20Roads">Battle of the Basque Roads</a>. In November 1811 she sailed to <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> where she was <a href="laid%20up%20in%20ordinary">laid up in ordinary</a>. Fitted out as a <a href="receiving%20ship">receiving ship</a> in 1822, she was eventually <a href="Ship%20breaking">broken up</a> in January 1836.

"Emerald" was a 36-gun, 18-pound, "Amazon"-class frigate built to William Rule's design. She and her sister ship, , were ordered on 24 May 1794 and were built to the same dimensions: along the <a href="gun%20deck">gun deck</a>, at the <a href="keel%23structural%20keels">keel</a>, with a beam of and a depth in the hold of . They measured 933 <a href="tons%20burthen">tons burthen</a>.

"Emerald" was completed at Thomas Pitcher's dockyard in Northfleet at a cost of £14,419 and launched on 31 July 1795, twenty-seven days after "Amazon". Her <a href="Copper%20sheathing">coppering</a> at <a href="Woolwich">Woolwich</a> was finished on 12 October 1795 and she was <a href="Fitting-out">fitted-out</a> at a further cost of £9,390. The Admiralty ordered a second pair of "Amazon"-class ships on 24 January 1795. They were marginally smaller at 925 tons (bm) and were built from <a href="Pinus%20rigida">pitch pine</a>.

"Emerald" was first <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> in August 1795, under Captain <a href="Velters%20Cornewall%20Berkeley">Velters Cornewall Berkeley</a> and in January 1797, she sailed for the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>. Spain had become allied to France and declared war on Britain in October 1796. Early in 1797, a Spanish fleet of 27 <a href="ships%20of%20the%20line">ships of the line</a> was at <a href="Cartagena%2C%20Spain">Cartagena</a> with orders to join the French fleet at Brest. A storm blew the Spanish fleet off course, enabling <a href="John%20Jervis%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20St%20Vincent">Admiral John Jervis'</a> fleet of 15 ships of the line to intercept it off Cape St Vincent on 14 February. Although attached to Jervis' fleet at the time, as a frigate "Emerald" was too lightly built to take part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20St%20Vincent%20%281797%29">Battle of Cape St Vincent</a>; instead she anchored in nearby <a href="Lagos%2C%20Portugal">Lagos Bay</a> with other vessels.

On 16 February, the victorious British fleet and its <a href="prize%20ship">prizes</a> entered the bay. Jervis ordered the three frigates—"Emerald", , and , of 40 and 32 guns respectively—to search for the disabled flagship, "Santisima Trinidad", which had been towed from the battle. Two smaller craft—<a href="HMS%20Bonne%20Citoyenne%20%281796%29">"Bonne-Citoyenne"</a>, a <a href="corvette">corvette</a> of 20 guns, and the 14-gun sloop —joined the frigates. The British squadron on 20 February sighted "Santisima Trinidad" under tow by a large frigate and in the company of a <a href="brig">brig</a>. Berkeley, considering the small squadron under his command insufficient, declined to engage and eventually the Spanish ships sailed from sight. The 32-gun , while cruising alone, later located "Santisima Trinidad" and engaged her but the out-gunned British frigate was forced to abandon her attack.

Following the Battle of Cape St Vincent, the British pursued the remainder of the Spanish fleet to <a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cadiz</a>, where Jervis began a long-running blockade of the port. On 26 April, while cruising in the company of the 74-gun , "Emerald" helped to capture a 34-gun Spanish ship and to destroy another. The Spanish vessels were close to the coast when Jervis's fleet sighted them. Sent to investigate, "Emerald" and "Irresistible", under Captain <a href="George%20Martin%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">George Martin</a>, discovered the ships were the frigates and —the Spanish ships had been carrying silver from <a href="Havana">Havana</a> to Cadiz, but had transferred their cargo the previous night to a fishing boat that had warned them of the proximity of the British fleet.

The Spanish ships sought shelter from the British north of Trafalgar in <a href="Conil%20de%20la%20Frontera">Conil Bay</a>, the entrance to which was protected by a large rocky ledge. "Irresistible" and "Emerald" negotiated this obstacle at around 14:30 and engaged the Spanish ships, which were anchored in the Bay. The Spanish ships surrendered at approximately 16:00. Eighteen Spaniards were killed and 30 wounded during the fighting; one Briton was killed and one wounded. The remaining crew of "Santa Elena" avoided capture by cutting her <a href="Hawser">cable</a>s and drifting her on shore so they could flee on foot. The British managed to drag "Santa Elena" off the beach but, badly damaged, she sank at sea.

The British took "Ninfa" into service as HMS "Hamadryad", a 36-gun frigate with a main <a href="Gun%20battery">battery</a> of 12-pounders, but were unable to retrieve the cargo of silver, which later arrived safely in Cadiz.

Captain <a href="Thomas%20Waller%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Thomas Waller</a> took command of "Emerald" in mid-1797, and was stationed with Admiral Jervis' fleet off Cadiz. On 3 July, Jervis attempted to end the protracted blockade by ordering a bombardment of the town. A first attempt resulted in the capture of two Spanish mortar boats but achieved little else. During a second bombardment on the night of 5 July, "Emerald", in the company of "Terpsichore" and the 74-gun , provided a protective escort for three bomb vessels, , , and . This attack caused considerable damage; the next morning, the Spanish hurriedly moved ten of their line-of-battle ships out of range. The British cancelled a third bombardment, planned for 8 July, when the weather became unfavourable.

Later in July 1797, "Emerald" took part in an unsuccessful attack on <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20de%20Tenerife">Santa Cruz</a>. A planned attack in April, proposed by <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson">Admiral Nelson</a>, had been aborted as the troops required to execute it were unavailable. When Jervis was subsequently advised that the Spanish treasure fleet was anchored there, he revived Nelson's idea.

For the new attack, Nelson was to take three ships of the line, three frigates, including "Emerald", and 200 <a href="marines">marines</a>, for an amphibious landing outside the Spanish stronghold. The frigates would then engage the batteries to the north-east of Santa Cruz while the marines stormed the town. However, a combination of strong currents and heavy Spanish fire forced the British to abandon the attack. Several further attempts were made between 22 and 25 July; although the British were able to land troops, Spanish resistance was too strong and the British had to ask for an honourable withdrawal.

After the attack, Nelson sent "Emerald" with his report to Jervis, who in turn sent her on to England with dispatches. Waller arrived at the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> on 1 September, with the news of the failed attacks.

While serving with Jervis on the <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> station in December 1797, "Emerald", under the temporary command of <a href="William%20Proby%2C%20Lord%20Proby">Lord William Proby</a>, captured the 8-gun <a href="privateer">privateer</a>, "Chasseur Basque". Waller returned as captain in April 1798. In May, Jervis dispatched a squadron of five ships, including "Emerald" and commanded by Nelson in the 74-gun , to locate a large invasion fleet that had left <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a>. After receiving intelligence on 22 May, Nelson correctly predicted the French fleet's destination and set course for <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> where the British captured or destroyed all but two of the French ships at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Nile">Battle of the Nile</a>, which occurred between 1–3 August 1798. "Emerald" missed the battle; having previously become separated from the rest of the squadron in a storm on 21 May, she arrived at <a href="Abu%20Qir%20Bay">Aboukir Bay</a> on 12 August.

When Nelson left for Naples on 19 August 1798, he left behind a squadron—comprising three <a href="Seventy-four%20%28ship%29">74s</a> , , , three frigates "Emerald", , and , and the corvette "Bonne Citoyenne"—under <a href="Sir%20Samuel%20Hood%2C%201st%20Baronet">Samuel Hood</a> to patrol the waters around the port and along the coast. On 2 September, it encountered and destroyed the French <a href="aviso">aviso</a> "Anémone".

"Emerald" and "Seahorse" chased "Anemone" inshore, where she anchored in shallow water out of their reach. When they launched their boats to cut-out "Anėmone", her crew cut the anchor cable and their ship drifted on to the shore; as the Frenchmen were attempting to escape along the coast, hostile Arabs captured them and stripped them of their clothes, shooting those who resisted. A heavy surf prevented the British boats from landing, so a midshipman from "Emerald", the young <a href="Francis%20Fane%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Francis Fane</a>, swam ashore with a line and empty cask to rescue the commander and seven others who had escaped naked to the beach. "Anėmone" had a crew of 60 men under the command of <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29%23France%20and%20Canada">"Enseigne de Vaisseau"</a> (Ensign) Garibou, and was also carrying General Camin and Citoyen Valette, <a href="Aide-de-Camp">Aide-de-Camp</a> to General <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> Bonaparte, with dispatches from Toulon. Camin and Valette were among those the Arabs killed. "Emerald" remained stationed off Alexandria for the rest of the year.

"Emerald" and "Minerve", while cruising together on 2 June, took "Caroline", a 16-gun French privateer, off the south-east coast of <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>. Later, "Emerald" assisted in the capture of , , , <a href="Spanish%20brig%20Infante%20%281787%29">"Salamine"</a>, and in the <a href="Action%20of%2018%20June%201799">Action of 18 June 1799</a>. The British fleet under <a href="George%20Elphinstone%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Keith">George Elphinstone</a> was some 69 miles off Cape Sicié when three French frigates and two brigs were spotted. Elphinstone engaged them with three seventy-fours, , and , and two frigates, "Emerald" and . The next evening, after a 28-hour chase, the French ships were forced into an action. The French squadron had scattered, enabling the British to attack it piecemeal. "Bellona" fired the first shots at 19:00 as she, "Captain", and the two frigates closed with "Junon" and "Alceste", both of which <a href="striking%20the%20colors">struck their colours</a> immediately. "Bellona" then joined "Centaur" in chasing "Courageuse". Faced with overwhelming odds, "Courageuse" also surrendered. "Emerald" then overhauled "Salamine", and "Captain" took "Alerte" at around 23:30.

"Emerald" returned to blockade duty at Cadiz in April 1800, joining a squadron under Rear-Admiral <a href="Sir%20John%20Duckworth%2C%201st%20Baronet">John Thomas Duckworth</a> that included the 74-gun ships and "Swiftsure", and the <a href="fireship">fireship</a> . The squadron sighted a Spanish convoy on 5 April, which comprised 13 merchant vessels and three accompanying frigates, and at once gave chase. At 03:00 the following day, "Emerald" managed to overhaul and cross the bow of a 10-gun merchantman, which, having nowhere to go, immediately surrendered. By daybreak, the remainder of the Spanish convoy had scattered and the only ship visible was a 14-gun brig, "Los Anglese". The absence of wind prevented the becalmed British vessels approaching her. Instead, "Leviathan" and "Emerald" lowered boats that rowed towards the brig, which they captured after a short exchange of fire.

Other sails were now spotted in the east, west and south, forcing the British to divide their force: "Swiftsure" went south, "Emerald" east, and "Leviathan" west. At midday, "Emerald" signalled that there were six vessels to the north-east, and "Leviathan" <a href="Wearing%20ship">wore round</a> to pursue. By dusk, the two British ships had nine Spanish craft in sight. Three ships were seen at midnight to the north-north-west, and by 02:00 the following morning, two had been identified as the enemy frigates and . Duckworth ordered "Emerald" to take a parallel course to the enemy frigates in anticipation of a dawn attack, and at first light, the British closed with their opponents.

The Spaniards had assumed the approaching vessels were part of their convoy, but by daybreak they had realised their error and vainly set more sail to escape. Being close enough to hail the Spanish crews, Duckworth ordered that they surrender. When the Spaniards ignored the demand, he ordered "Leviathan" and "Emerald" to open fire on the rigging of the Spanish vessels in order to disable them. Both Spanish frigates quickly surrendered. "Carmen" had had 11 men killed and 16 wounded; "Florentina" 12 killed and 10 wounded, including her first and second captains. The two Spanish frigates were each carrying 1500 <a href="quintal">quintal</a>s of mercury.

A third frigate was visible on the horizon. "Emerald" immediately set off in pursuit but Duckworth recalled her and instead ordered her to locate the merchant ships; she secured four of the largest vessels by nightfall. The need to make the two captured frigates ready to sail delayed "Leviathan", and by the time this was completed the third frigate had made her escape. "Leviathan" then returned to rendezvous with "Emerald", managing to take a further enemy brig before night fell. The following day, both British vessels sailed for <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> with their prizes. On arrival, they encountered "Incendiary", which had made port the previous day with two captured vessels of its own. The small British squadron managed to secure nine merchant vessels and two frigates in total.

Britain declared war on France in May 1803 following the short-lived <a href="Peace%20of%20Amiens">Peace of Amiens</a> and by June, "Emerald", under the command of Captain James O'Bryen, had joined Samuel Hood's squadron in the <a href="Leeward%20Islands">Leeward Islands</a>. Prior to the British invasion of <a href="St%20Lucia">St Lucia</a> on 21 June, she harassed enemy shipping, disrupting the island's resupply.

The invasion force left <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a> on 20 June. It comprised Hood's 74-gun flagship , the 74-gun , the frigates and "Chichester", and the <a href="Sloop-of-war">sloops</a> and . The following morning, "Emerald" and the 18-gun sloop had joined them. By 11:00, the squadron was anchored in <a href="Choc%20Bay">Choc Bay</a>. The troops were landed by 17:00 and half an hour later the town of <a href="Castries">Castries</a> was in British hands. In the island's main fortress, Morne-Fortunée, the French troops refused to surrender; the British stormed it at 04:00 on 22 June, and by 04:30 St Lucia was in British hands. Following this easy victory, the British sent a force to <a href="Tobago">Tobago</a>, which capitulated on 1 July.

"Emerald" was between St Lucia and Martinique on 24 June, when she captured the 16-gun French privateer <a href="HMS%20Saint%20Lucia%20%281803%29">"Enfant Prodigue"</a> after a 72-hour chase. The French vessel was under the command of "<a href="lieutenant%20de%20vaisseau">lieutenant de vaisseau</a>" Victor Lefbru and was carrying dispatches for Martinique. The Royal Navy took "Enfant Prodigue" into service as HMS St Lucia.

While in the company of the 22-gun brig , "Emerald" intercepted and captured a Dutch merchant vessel travelling between <a href="Surinam%20%28Dutch%20colony%29">Surinam</a> and <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> on 10 August. On 5 September, she captured two French schooners, and later that month took part in attacks on <a href="Berbice">Berbice</a>, <a href="Essequibo%20%28colony%29">Essequibo</a> and <a href="Demarara">Demarara</a>.

"Emerald"s first lieutenant, Thomas Forest, commanded the 6-gun <a href="Cutter%20%28boat%29">cutter</a> on 13 March 1804 when, with 30 of "Emerald"s crew aboard, she captured a French privateer off <a href="Saint-Pierre%2C%20Martinique">Saint-Pierre, Martinique</a>. Contrary winds prevented the privateer, "Mosambique", from entering St Pierre and she had sought shelter beneath the batteries at Seron. Because "Emerald" was too far downwind, Captain O'Bryen used boats and crew from "Emerald" to create a diversion and draw fire from the battery while "Fort Diamond" approached from the opposite direction, rounded Pearl Rock (some two miles off the coast), and bore down on "Mosambique". Forest put the cutter alongside with such force that a chain securing the privateer to the shore snapped. The 60-man French crew abandoned their vessel and swam ashore. The Royal Navy took into service.

In the spring of 1804, "Emerald" and her crew took part in an invasion of <a href="Surinam%20%28Dutch%20colony%29">Surinam</a>. The invasion force consisted of Hood's flagship , "Emerald", the 44-gun heavy frigates <a href="Hector%20%281784%20ship%29">"Pandour"</a> and , the 28-gun <a href="sixth-rate">sixth-rate</a> , the 12-gun <a href="schooner">schooner</a> , the 12-gun <a href="corvette">corvette</a> , and the 8-gun <a href="Earl%20of%20Mornington%20%281799%20ship%29">"Drake"</a>, together with 2,000 troops under <a href="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</a> Sir Charles Green. The force arrived from Barbados on 25 April after a twenty-two-day journey. The sloop "Hippomenes", a transport and a further three armed vessels, landed <a href="Frederick%20Maitland">Brigadier-General Frederick Maitland</a> and 700 troops at Warapee Creek on the night of 30 April. The following night, O'Bryen was ordered to assist Brigadier-general Hughes in the taking of Braam's Point. A sandbar initially prevented "Emerald" from entering the <a href="Surinam%20River">Surinam River</a> but O'Bryen forced her across on the rising tide, with "Pandour" and "Drake" following. Anchoring close by, the three British ships quickly put the Dutch battery of 18-pounders out of action and captured the fort without loss of life.

"Emerald", "Pandour", and "Drake" then pushed up the river, sometimes in less water than the frigates required to float properly, until on 5 May they arrived close to the forts Leyden and Frederici. The British landed a detachment of troops under Hughes some distance away, which marching under the cover of the forests and swamps, launched an attack that resulted in the swift capture of the two forts. By this time, most of the squadron had managed to work its way up the river as far as Frederici, Maitland was advancing along the <a href="Commewijne%20River">Commewine River</a>, and with troops poised to attack the fort of New Amsterdam, the Batavian commandant, Lieutenant-Colonel Batenburg, duly surrendered.

"Emerald" captured the vessel "Augusta", which was under American colours, on 22 August and sent her into Antigua with the cargo of wine that she had been carrying from <a href="Livorno">Leghorn</a> to Guadeloupe. "Emerald" left <a href="Tortola">Tortola</a> on 26 October as escort to a convoy of 50 vessels for England but having parted from them in a storm, she put into Madeira in distress on 11 December.

Between February and June 1806, "Emerald" underwent repairs at <a href="Deptford%20dockyard">Deptford dockyard</a> and was recommissioned under Captain John Armour; <a href="Frederick%20Lewis%20Maitland%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Frederick Lewis Maitland</a> assumed command in the first quarter of 1807. While in the <a href="Basque%20Roads">Basque Roads</a> in April, "Emerald" captured the 14-gun privateer "Austerlitz", a brig from Nantes under the command of Captain Gatien Lafont. "Emerald", while escorting a Spanish <a href="Xebec">polacca</a> that she had taken, spotted and captured the privateer on 14 April after a ten-hour chase. "Austerlitz" had been out of port two days but had made no captures; the polacca was the Spanish ship "Prince of Asturias", which had sailed from <a href="La%20Guaira">La Guayra</a> with a cargo of cocoa, bark and indigo. "Emerald" sent both prizes into Plymouth, where they arrived on 22 April. "Emerald" herself set off in pursuit of another vessel from La Guayra.

"Emerald" recaptured "Zulema" which had been plundered and taken by a French privateer as she sailed from Philadelphia to Liverpool. She arrived in Plymouth under her master, Mr Howard, on 4 May. During December, Plymouth received more of "Emerald's" captures. At the beginning of the month, "Young Elias" was detained. Her master Monsieur Delance, had been sailing from Philadelphia to Bordeaux. On 26 December, Mr Seaton's vessel, "Friendship" was caught returning from France.

"Emerald"s boats participated in a <a href="Naval%20boarding">cutting-out expedition</a> in <a href="Viveiro">Viveiro</a> harbour on 13 March 1808. While cruising inshore at around 17:00, "Emerald" spotted a large French schooner, "Apropos", of 250 tons (bm), anchored in the bay. "Apropos" was armed with twelve 8-pounder guns, though pierced for 16, and had a crew of more than 70 men under the command of "lieutenant de vaisseau" Lagary.

The crews of the schooner and of the two batteries guarding the harbour had seen "Emerald" but Maitland still made plans to attack "Apropos". He soon discovered it was not possible to place "Emerald" so as to engage both enemy batteries simultaneously, and instead sent landing parties to silence the guns, which had been firing on his ship since 17:30. The first landing party, led by Lieutenant Bertram and accompanied by two marine lieutenants and two master mates, stormed the outer fort. Maitland then positioned "Emerald" close to the second battery while a boat under the command of his third lieutenant, Smith, landed about a mile along the shore. This second landing party encountered Spanish soldiers, but drove them off and pursued them inland. By the time Smith's party returned to the beach, "Emerald" had already silenced the battery. In the darkness, Smith subsequently failed to locate the fort.

The crew of "Apropos" had run her ashore soon after "Emerald" had entered the harbour. The harbour batteries having been destroyed, Captain Maitland sent a further force under Midshipman Baird to secure and refloat the French ship. The original landing party under Lieutenant Bertram, which had already encountered and dispersed 60 members of the schooner's crew, met Baird's party on the beach. The British made several unsuccessful attempts to re-float the schooner before being forced to set her afire and depart. British casualties were heavy. "Emerald" had nine men killed, and 16 wounded, including Lieutenant Bertram. Maitland estimated that French casualties too had been heavy.

In 1847 the Admiralty issued the clasp "Emerald 13 March 1808" to the <a href="Naval%20General%20Service%20Medal%20%281847%29">Naval General Service Medal</a> to the ten surviving claimants from the action.

A French schooner "Amadea" arrived in <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> on 15 December 1808 having previously been captured and sent in by "Emerald". Back in the Basque Roads on 23 February 1809, "Emerald" was this time part of a squadron under <a href="Robert%20Stopford%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Robert Stopford</a>. Stopford's flagship, the 80-gun , was also accompanied by the seventy-fours and , and the 36-gun frigates and . At 20:00, Stopford's squadron was anchored off the Chassiron Lighthouse, to the north-west of <a href="Ile%20d%27Ol%C3%A9ron">Ile d'Oléron</a>, when the sighting of several rockets prompted him to investigate. About an hour later, sails were seen to the east which the British followed until daylight the following morning. The sails belonged to a French squadron that Stopford deduced to be out of <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a> and which <a href="Heave%20to">heaved to</a> in the <a href="Pertuis%20d%27Antioche">Pertuis d'Antioche</a>.

The French force comprised eight ships of the line and two frigates, and Stopford immediately sent "Naiad" to apprise <a href="James%20Gambier%2C%201st%20Baron%20Gambier">Admiral James Gambier</a> of the situation. "Naiad" had not gone too far however when she signalled that there were three other vessels to the north-west. Stopford ordered "Amethyst" and "Emerald" to remain while he and the rest of the squadron set off in pursuit. The British frigate and the sloop also joined the chase. "Caesar", "Donegal", "Defiance", and "Amelia" eventually drove the three French frigates ashore and destroyed them.

"Emerald" and "Amethyst" had more success in the spring of 1809 when on 23 March they captured the brigs "Caroline" and "Serpent". In April, "Emerald" assisted "Amethyst" in the chase of a large 44-gun frigate off <a href="Ushant">Ushant</a>. "Emerald" sighted , with a main battery of 18-pounders and under the command of Captain Dupoter, at 11:00 on 5 April and immediately signalled "Amethyst" for assistance. "Amethyst" caught a glimpse of the French forty-four just as she turned away to the south-east and gave chase but by 19:20 had lost sight of both "Niemen" and "Emerald". "Amethyst" fell in with "Niemen" again at around 21:30 and engaged her. "Niemen" was forced to strike when a second British frigate, came into view and fired a broadside. The Royal Navy took "Niemen" into service under her existing name.

On 26 March, "Enfant de Patria" arrived at Plymouth. "Patria", of 500 tons (bm), 10 guns, and 60 men, had sailed from France for <a href="Isle%20de%20France%20%28Mauritius%29">Île de France</a> when "Emerald" and "Amethyst" captured her. Two days later "Emerald" captured a second letter of marque, the 4-gun "Aventurier", bound for the relief of Guadeloupe. She had a crew of 30 men.

"Emerald" was part of the fleet under Admiral <a href="James%20Gambier%2C%201st%20Baron%20Gambier">Lord Gambier</a> that fought the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Basque%20Roads">Battle of the Basque Roads</a> in April 1809. The French ships were anchored under the protection of the powerful batteries on the <a href="Isle%20d%27Aix">Isle d'Aix</a> when on 11 April <a href="Thomas%20Cochrane%2C%2010th%20Earl%20of%20Dundonald">Lord Cochrane</a> attacked them with fireships and explosive vessels. "Emerald" provided a diversion to the east of the island with the brigs , , , and "Growler". The fireships met with only partial success; the French, having anticipated such an attack, had rigged a boom across the channel. One of the explosive vessels breached the boom, leading the French to cut their cables and drift on to the shoals.

The following day, after much delay, Gambier ordered a battle squadron to reinforce Cochrane in the Basque Roads. The British ships anchored, with springs, in a crescent around some of the stranded French ships, and exchanged fire. "Emerald" took up position ahead of "Indefatigable" and behind "Aigle" and "Unicorn", and directed her fire mainly towards the French ships of the line, <a href="French%20ship%20Ville%20de%20Varsovie%20%281808%29">"Varsovie"</a> and <a href="French%20ship%20Nestor%20%281793%29">"Aquilon"</a>, both of which struck at around 17:30. 
At 20:00, "Emerald", along with the other British frigates and brigs, weighed and anchored with the 74-gun in the Maumusson passage to the south of Oléron while a second fireship attack was under preparation. Although the fireships were ready in the early hours on the 13th, contrary winds prevented their deployment. The British instead set "Varsovie" and "Aquilon" alight just after 03:00, on the orders of Captain <a href="John%20Bligh%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">John Bligh</a>, after removing their crews. "Emerald", and the other vessels moored with her, were recalled at 05:00 but owing to the lack of water, only the brigs were able to pass further up the river. "Emerald" therefore took no further part in the attack, which continued until 29 April when the last French ship was able to free herself from the mud and escape up the river to <a href="Rochefort%2C%20Charente-Maritime">Rochefort</a>.

"Emerald" took two French sloops in July 1809. "Deux Freres", en route for Guadeloupe from Rochelle when captured, arrived in Plymouth on 26 July. A week later, "Emerald" captured the French schooner "Balance", which had been sailing to France from Guadeloupe. Both captures carried <a href="letters%20of%20marque">letters of marque</a>, a government licence authorising the attack and capture of enemy vessels. The first, of four guns, was carrying a small reinforcement for Guadeloupe's garrison. The second, also of four guns, was carrying a cargo of coffee and other colonial produce.

While off the coast of Ireland on 8 October, "Emerald" rescued a British brig by capturing "Incomparable", an 8-gun French privateer. The Frenchman was about to take the British vessel when "Emerald" intervened. "Incomparable" had a crew of 63 men and was four days out of <a href="Saint-Malo">Saint-Malo</a>, but had not yet captured any other vessel. Still in Irish waters on 6 November, "Emerald" took the 16-gun French brig , two days out of <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a> and bound for <a href="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a>. After an all-night chase, "Emerald" caught up. "Capitaine de fregate" Croquet Deschateurs of "Fanfaron" resisted, firing several broadsides and a final double-shotted broadside. Unable to escape, Deschateurs prepared to board but "Emerald" evaded the manoeuvre and fired a broadside that dismasted "Fanfaron", leaving Deschateurs no option but to surrender his vessel. The subsequent French court-martial not only absolved Deschateurs of any liability for the loss but also commended him for his conduct. Four days later "Emerald" arrived at Cork with "Fanfaron" and "Luna". "Fanfaron", with a crew of 113, had been carrying a cargo of flour, salt, and other provisions, as well as iron, lead, and nails, all for Guadeloupe.

At the beginning of February 1810, "Emerald" captured and sent into Plymouth, "Commerce", Hanson, master, which had been sailing from Drontheim to Bordeaux. Then on 22 March, "Emerald" captured the 350-ton (bm) "Belle Etoile" in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a>. Caught after a twelve-hour chase during which she jettisoned much of her cargo; "Belle Etoile", out of Bayonne, was pierced for 20 guns but only carried eight. Carrying a cargo of wine, flour, oil, and other merchandise to Île de France, she was sent into Cork with her 56-man crew. "Emerald" captured an American ship, "Wasp", in July 1810. "Wasp" was carrying 91 passengers from New York to Bordeaux; they arrived at Plymouth on 30 July.

"Emerald" was still serving on the Home Station on 11 April 1811 when she sent into Cork a French privateer. This was the 18-gun (or "Augusta"), which had been taken on 6 April. Nearly a month later, on 5 July, "Emerald" left Madeira in the company of five <a href="East%20Indiamen">East Indiamen</a> and was still on convoy duties later that month when a transport ship spotted her escorting thirteen vessels off the coast of West Africa on 18 July.

In November 1811, "Emerald" sailed to <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> and was laid up <a href="reserve%20fleet">in ordinary</a>. Fitted out as a receiving ship in 1822, she was eventually broken up in January 1836.

Scientific Detective Monthly

Scientific Detective Monthly (also known as Amazing Detective Tales and Amazing Detective Stories) was a <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> which published fifteen issues beginning in January 1930. It was launched by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a> as part of his second venture into <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> magazine publishing, and was intended to focus on detective and mystery stories with a scientific element. Many of the stories involved contemporary science without any imaginative elements—for example, a story in the first issue turned on the use of a <a href="bolometer">bolometer</a> to detect a black girl blushing—but there were also one or two science fiction stories in every issue.

The title was changed to "Amazing Detective Tales" with the June 1930 issue, perhaps to avoid the word "scientific", which may have given readers the impression of "a sort of scientific periodical", in Gernsback's words, rather than a magazine intended to entertain. At the same time, the editor—Hector Grey—was replaced by <a href="David%20Lasser">David Lasser</a>, who was already editing Gernsback's other science fiction magazines. The title change apparently did not make the magazine a success, and Gernsback closed it down with the October issue. He sold the title to publisher Wallace Bamber, who produced at least five more issues in 1931 under the title "Amazing Detective Stories".

By the end of the 19th century, stories that were centered on scientific inventions and set in the future, in the tradition of <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a>, were appearing regularly in popular fiction magazines. The first <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> (sf) magazine, "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", was launched in 1926 by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a> at the height of the <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> era. It was successful, and helped to form science fiction as a separately marketed genre, but in February 1929 Gernsback lost control of the publisher when it went bankrupt. By April he had formed a new company, Gernsback Publications Incorporated, and created two subsidiaries: Techni-Craft Publishing Corporation and Stellar Publishing Corporation. In the middle of the year he launched three new magazines: a non-sf magazine titled "Radio Craft", and two sf pulps titled "<a href="Wonder%20Stories">Science Wonder Stories</a>" and "<a href="Wonder%20Stories">Air Wonder Stories</a>". These were followed in September 1929 by the first issue of "Science Wonder Quarterly", and in October Gernsback sent a letter to some of the writers he had already bought material from, letting them know that he was seeing more demand for "detective or criminal mystery stories with a good "scientific" background". He named Arthur B. Reeve's "Craig Kennedy" stories as an example, and also mentioned S.S. Van Dine's "Philo Vance" stories, which were very popular at the time. In the January 1930 issue of both the sf magazines, Gernsback advertised the new magazine that he hoped to populate with these stories: "Scientific Detective Monthly".

Gernsback believed that science fiction was educational, claiming, for example, that "teachers encourage the reading of this fiction because they know that it gives the pupil a fundamental knowledge of science and aviation". He intended "Scientific Detective Monthly" to be a detective magazine in which the stories had a scientific background; it would entertain, but also instruct. The subgenre of scientific detective fiction was not new; it had first become popular in the U.S. between 1909 and 1919, and the appearance of Gernsback's magazine was part of a resurgence of popularity in the subgenre at the end of the 1920s. The first issue was dated January 1930 (meaning it would have been on the newsstands in mid-December 1929). Gernsback was editor-in-chief, and had final say on the choice of stories, but the editorial work was done by his deputy, Hector Grey.

In February 1930, an article by Gernsback appeared in "<a href="Writer%27s%20Digest">Writers' Digest</a>" titled "How to Write 'Science' Stories". In it, Gernsback offered advice on how to write stories for his new magazine, claiming that scientific detective stories represented the future of the genre, and that "the ordinary gangster and detective story will be relegated into the background in a very few years". Science fiction historian Gary Westfahl comments that the article also serves as a guide to writing science fiction in general, and that the article is the first "how to" article published for the new genre of science fiction.

With the June issue, the title was changed to "Amazing Detective Tales". Gernsback merged "Science Wonder Stories" and "Air Wonder Stories" into "Wonder Stories" at the same time; he was concerned that the word "Science" was putting off some potential readers, who assumed that the magazine was, in his words, "a sort of scientific periodical". It is likely that the same reasoning motivated "Scientific Detective Monthly"s new title. In the following issue, Grey was replaced as editor by <a href="David%20Lasser">David Lasser</a>, who was already editing Gernsback's other sf titles, and an attempt was made to include more stories with science fiction elements. Gernsback continued the magazine for five issues under the new title; the last issue was dated October 1930. The decision to cease publication was apparently taken suddenly, as the October issue included the announcement that the format would change in November from large to standard pulp size, and listed two stories planned for the November issue. Gernsback sold the title to Wallace Bamber, who published at least five more issues, starting in February 1931; no issues are known for June or July 1931, or after August.

The stories in "Scientific Detective Monthly" were almost always detective stories, but they were only occasionally science fiction, as in many cases the science appearing in the stories already had practical applications. In the first issue, for example, "The Mystery of the Bulawayo Diamond", by <a href="Arthur%20B.%20Reeve">Arthur B. Reeve</a>, mentions unusual science, but the mystery is solved by use of a <a href="bolometer">bolometer</a> to detect a blush on the face of a black girl. The murderer in "The Campus Murder Mystery", by Ralph W. Wilkins, freezes the body to conceal the manner of death; a chemical catalyst and electrical measurements of palm sweat provide the scientific elements in two other stories in the same issue. The only genuine science fiction story in the first issue is "The Perfect Counterfeit" by Captain <a href="S.P.%20Meek">S.P. Meek</a>, in which a matter duplicator has been used to counterfeit paper money. Van Dine's Philo Vance novel, "The Bishop Murder Case", began serialization in the first issue, which probably assisted sales, since the hardcover edition of the novel, which had appeared only a few months previously, had sold well. It was not science fiction, however, and throughout the magazine's run, only one or two stories per issue include elements that would qualify them as science fiction. <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a>, a historian of the field, suggests that Gernsback was more interested in stories about the science of detection than in imaginary science: most of "Scientific Detective Monthly"'s contents were gadget stories, of a kind which Gernsback had been publishing in his other magazines for some time. The cover for the first issue, by Jno Ruger, showed a detective using an electronic device to measure the reactions of a suspect.

Later issues included stories by some writers who either were already well-known to readers of science fiction or would soon become so, including <a href="Lloyd%20Arthur%20Eshbach">Lloyd Arthur Eshbach</a>, <a href="David%20H.%20Keller">David H. Keller</a>, <a href="Ed%20Earl%20Repp">Ed Earl Repp</a>, <a href="Neil%20R.%20Jones">Neil R. Jones</a>, and <a href="Edmond%20Hamilton">Edmond Hamilton</a>, though even these stories were not always science fiction. Hamilton's "The Invisible Master", for example, describes a way to become invisible, but at the end of the story the science is revealed to be a hoax, and the story is straightforward detective fiction. <a href="Clark%20Ashton%20Smith">Clark Ashton Smith</a>, later to be better known for his fantasy than for science fiction, contributed "Murder in the Fourth Dimension" to the October 1930 issue; the protagonist uses the fourth dimension to dispose of his victim's corpse.

As well as fiction, there were some non-fiction departments, including readers' letters (even in the first issue—Gernsback obtained letters by advertising the magazine to readers who subscribed to his other magazines), book reviews, and miscellaneous crime or science-related fillers. The first issue included a test of the readers' powers of observation: it showed a crime scene, which the readers were supposed to study, and then posed questions to see how much they could remember of the details. There was also a questionnaire about science, which asked about scientific facts mentioned in the stories, and a "Science-Crime Notes" section containing news items about science and crime. Gernsback's editorial argued that science would eventually end crime, and suggested that both the police and criminals would make growing use of scientific innovations in the future. Gernsback included on the masthead the names of several experts on crime, such as Edwin Cooley, a professor of criminology at Fordham University; he also listed members of his staff on the masthead with made-up titles: C.P. Mason, a member of his editorial staff, was listed as "Scientific Criminologist", for example.

After the sale, Bamber filled the magazine with ordinary detective fiction, including <a href="Edgar%20Wallace">Edgar Wallace</a>'s "The Feathered Serpent".

The first few covers of the magazine did not advertise the names of the authors whose work was inside, which was probably a mistake as existing science fiction readers might have been attracted by the names of writers with whom they were familiar. Conversely, the readers who might have been interested in the more sedate topics covered by the non-fiction were probably discouraged by the lurid cover artwork. Gernsback was unable to obtain enough fiction to make "Scientific Detective Monthly" a true mixture of the two genres, and the result was a magazine that failed to fully appeal to fans of either genre. It was, in sf historian Robert Lowndes' words, a "fascinating experiment", but a failed one.

"Scientific Detective Monthly" was published by Techni-Craft Publishing Co. of New York for the first ten issues, and then by Fiction Publishers, Inc., also of New York. The editor-in-chief was Hugo Gernsback for the first ten issues; the managing editor was Hector Grey for the first six issues, and David Lasser for the next four. The editor for the 1931 issues is not known. The first volume contained ten numbers, the second contained four, and the last contained only one. The title changed to "Amazing Detective Tales" with the June 1930 issue, and again to "Amazing Detective Stories" in February 1931. The magazine was in large pulp format throughout; it was 96 pages long and priced at 25 cents.

Lilias Armstrong

Lilias Eveline Armstrong (29 September 1882 – 9 December 1937) was an English <a href="Phonetics">phonetician</a>. She worked at <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a>, where she attained the rank of <a href="Reader%20%28academic%20rank%29">reader</a>. Armstrong is most known for her work on English <a href="intonation%20%28linguistics%29">intonation</a> as well as the phonetics and <a href="tone%20%28linguistics%29">tone</a> of <a href="Somali%20language">Somali</a> and <a href="Kikuyu%20language">Kikuyu</a>. Her book on English intonation, written with <a href="Ida%20C.%20Ward">Ida C. Ward</a>, was in print for 50 years. Armstrong also provided some of the first detailed descriptions of tone in Somali and Kikuyu.

Armstrong grew up in <a href="Northern%20England">Northern England</a>. She graduated from the <a href="University%20of%20Leeds">University of Leeds</a>, where she studied French and Latin. She taught French in an elementary school in the London suburbs for a while, but then joined the University College Phonetics Department, headed by <a href="Daniel%20Jones%20%28phonetician%29">Daniel Jones</a>. Her most notable works were the 1926 book "A Handbook of English Intonation", co-written with Ward, the 1934 paper "The Phonetic Structure of Somali", and the book "The Phonetic and Tonal Structure of Kikuyu", published posthumously in 1940 after she died of a stroke in 1937 at age 55.

She was the subeditor of the <a href="International%20Phonetic%20Association">International Phonetic Association</a>'s journal "" for more than a decade, and was praised in her day for her teaching, both during the academic term and in the department's summer vacation courses. Jones wrote in his obituary of her that she was "one of the finest phoneticians in the world".

Lilias Eveline Armstrong was born on 29 September 1882 in <a href="Pendlebury">Pendlebury</a>, <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, to James William Armstrong, a <a href="Free%20Methodist%20Church">Free Methodist</a> minister, and Mary Elizabeth Armstrong, "née" Hunter. Her upbringing led to her speech having certain <a href="English%20language%20in%20northern%20England">Northern English</a> characteristics. Armstrong studied French and Latin at the <a href="University%20of%20Leeds">University of Leeds</a>, where she was a king's scholar. She received her B.A. in 1906, and she was also trained as a teacher.

After graduating from Leeds, Armstrong taught French in <a href="East%20Ham">East Ham</a> for several years; she had success in this line of work, and was well on her way to becoming <a href="head%20teacher">headmistress</a> by the time she left this position in 1918. While she was Senior Assistant Mistress, she began studying phonetics in the evenings part-time at the University College Phonetics Department in order to improve her teaching of French pronunciation. In 1917, Armstrong received a Diploma with Distinction in French Phonetics; she got a Diploma with Distinction in English phonetics the following year.

Armstrong first taught phonetics in 1917 in Daniel Jones's summer course for missionaries; even before then, Jones had planned to give Armstrong a full-time position at the <a href="University%20College%20London">University College</a> Phonetics Department. Those plans were temporarily put on hold when <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a> decided against a budgetary increase for the department in October, but in November 1917, Jones nominated Armstrong to receive a temporary, part-time lectureship, which she started in February 1918. She was finally able to work full-time at the start of the 1918–1919 academic year, becoming the Phonetics Department's first full-time assistant. Armstrong became <a href="lecturer">lecturer</a> in 1920, <a href="senior%20lecturer">senior lecturer</a> in 1921, and <a href="Reader%20%28academic%20rank%29">reader</a> in 1937. Her promotion to readership was announced in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" and "The Universities Review". Armstrong also occasionally taught at the <a href="SOAS%2C%20University%20of%20London">School of Oriental Studies</a>. When Jones had to take a leave of absence the first nine months of 1920, Armstrong became acting head of the department in his stead. During this time, she interviewed and admitted students into the department. Other positions she held at University College were Chairman of the Refectory Committee and Secretary of the Women Staff Common Room. <a href="Learned%20society">Learned societies</a> Armstrong belonged to included the <a href="International%20Phonetic%20Association">International Phonetic Association</a>, the <a href="Modern%20Language%20Association">Modern Language Association</a>, and the International Congress of Phonetic Sciences.

Armstrong taught classes on the phonetics of French, English, Swedish, and Russian, and, alongside Daniel Jones, a class on <a href="speech-language%20pathology">speech pathology</a> titled "Lecture-demonstrations on Methods of Correcting Defects of Speech". Armstrong also led ear-training exercises, which were an important part of teaching at the University College Department of Phonetics.

In addition, Armstrong was involved in the teaching of several vacation courses held at University College. In 1919, the Phonetics Department began teaching its popular vacation courses in French and English phonetics. In the inaugural 1919 course, Armstrong conducted daily ear-training exercises for a course intended for those studying and teaching French. Two readers of "<a href="English%20Studies%20%28journal%29">English Studies</a>" who had attended the 1919 summer course for English favourably described Armstrong's ear-tests as "a great help" and "splendid"; these ear-training exercises were praised by the journal ". A Dutch participant in the 1921 session lauded Armstrong's ear-training classes and provided a description thereof. By the 1921 summer course, she not only conducted the ear-training exercises, but also lectured on English phonetics alongside Jones; she later gave lectures on English phonetics for a "Course of Spoken English for Foreigners", taught with Jones and <a href="Arthur%20Lloyd%20James">Arthur Lloyd James</a> during the summer of 1930. An advertisement for the 1935 summer course described the whole programme as being "under the general direction" of Jones and Armstrong; that year included lectures taught by Armstrong and John Rupert Firth as well as ear-training exercises led by Jones and Armstrong.

In October 1922, Armstrong delivered a public lecture at University College about the use of phonetics in teaching French. The Verse Speaking Fellowship invited her to speak at their annual conference in 1933. She travelled to <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> in 1925 to deliver lectures on English intonation, going to <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a> in September and <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> in October. In April 1927, she gave a lecture on English intonation to a meeting of the of <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>, <a href="Finland">Finland</a>. Other countries Armstrong travelled to in order to give lectures included the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>.

Armstrong had several students who were well-known scholars and linguists themselves. Indian linguist <a href="Suniti%20Kumar%20Chatterji">Suniti Kumar Chatterji</a> studied at the University of London from 1919 to 1921 for his <a href="Doctor%20of%20Letters">D.Litt.</a>; while he was there, Armstrong and <a href="Ida%20C.%20Ward">Ida C. Ward</a> taught him phonetics and drilled him with ear-training and transcription exercises. John Rupert Firth, who would later work at the University College Phonetics Department himself along Armstrong, was a student at University College from 1923 to 1924; the classes he took included Armstrong's course in French Phonetics. In the summer of 1934, Scottish phonetician <a href="J.%20C.%20Catford">J. C. Catford</a>, then age 17, took a class in French phonetics taught by Armstrong and Hélène Coustenoble. Armstrong taught advanced phonetics to American linguist <a href="Lorenzo%20Dow%20Turner">Lorenzo Dow Turner</a> while he was doing postdoctoral research at the School of Oriental Studies from 1936 to 1937. French Canadian linguist , who got his masters degree studying under Armstrong in 1937 and later worked alongside her, specifically pointed out Armstrong's kindness and articulatory prowess. While Australian literary scholar <a href="Robert%20Guy%20Howarth">Robert Guy Howarth</a> was studying for his doctorate in English from 1937 to 1938, he also got a certificate in phonetics and took "A Course of General Phonetics", taught by Armstrong and others.

The International Phonetic Association had suspended publication of its journal ' during World War I, but in 1921 it began producing a yearly publication ' ("Texts for our students"), which consisted of texts transcribed in the <a href="International%20Phonetic%20Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet</a> (IPA) from various languages, such as English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. Armstrong contributed several transcriptions of English texts throughout its volumes.

In 1923, ' resumed publication and started its third series. Armstrong was listed as the ' (<a href="Copy%20editing">subeditor</a>) starting from the July–September 1923 issue (3rd Ser. 3); she held this position throughout the January–March 1936 issue (3rd Ser. 53). Armstrong had a significant role in the renewal of the journal and of the International Phonetic Association, whose activities depended on the journal's publication. She wrote various book reviews in the journal's (, "Reports") section, as well as phonetic transcriptions of English texts in its (, "Students' section").

''s (', "Specimens") section consisted of phonetic sketches of less-studied languages accompanied by the phonetic transcription of a short text. For instance, one year ' had specimens of <a href="Ga%20language">Gã</a>, <a href="Biscayan%20dialect">Biscayan</a>, <a href="Non-native%20pronunciations%20of%20English%23Japanese">Japanese English</a>, <a href="Poitevin%20dialect">Poitevin</a>, and <a href="Punjabi%20language">Punjabi</a>. Armstrong's first specimen was of <a href="Swedish%20language">Swedish</a> and published in 1927; it consisted of an inventory of <a href="Swedish%20phonology%23Vowels">Swedish vowels</a> and a transcription of "" (', "The man who dropped his axe"), a translation of "<a href="The%20Honest%20Woodcutter">The Honest Woodcutter</a>", as pronounced by Fröken Gyllander of Stockholm. Earlier, Swedish grammarian had thanked Armstrong for her assistance in describing the phonetics and sound-system of Swedish in his 1923 book "Modern Swedish Grammar". Armstrong's second specimen, published in 1929, was of <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a> and consisted of a transcription of an excerpt of <a href="Nikolai%20Gogol">Nikolai Gogol</a>'s "<a href="May%20Night%2C%20or%20the%20Drowned%20Maiden">May Night, or the Drowned Maiden</a>". Armstrong had also corrected the proof of M. V. Trofimov and Daniel Jones's 1923 book "The Pronunciation of Russian". Armstrong also did research on Arabic phonetics, but never published anything on the subject, although she wrote a review of British missionary <a href="William%20Henry%20Temple%20Gairdner">William Henry Temple Gairdner</a>'s book on Arabic phonetics for "".

Armstrong's first two books, "An English Phonetic Reader" (1923) and "A Burmese Phonetic Reader" (1925, with Pe Maung Tin), were part of the London Phonetics Readers Series, edited by Daniel Jones. Books in this series provided a phonetic sketch as well as texts transcribed in the <a href="International%20Phonetic%20Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet</a>. Her "English Phonetic Reader" included transcriptions of passages written by <a href="Alfred%20George%20Gardiner">Alfred George Gardiner</a>, <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a>, <a href="Robert%20Louis%20Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a>, and <a href="John%20Ruskin">John Ruskin</a>. Jones had encouraged Armstrong to write a phonetic reader of English in "narrow transcription". One of the chief distinctions of "narrow transcription" for English was the use of the additional phonetic symbols for vowels, such as (as in the <a href="Received%20Pronunciation">RP</a> pronunciation of <a href="Lexical%20set">)</a>, (), and (). In the analysis behind a Jonesian "broad transcription" of English, the principal difference between those vowels and the vowels (), (), and (), respectively, was thought of as <a href="length%20%28phonetics%29">length</a> instead of <a href="vowel%20quality">quality</a>; accordingly, the absence or presence of a length diacritic was used to distinguish these vowels instead of separate IPA characters. Armstrong's narrow transcription for the reader used these extra vowel symbols and explicitly marked vowel length with the diacritics 'half-long' and 'long'. She also discussed the use of narrow transcription in her first paper for "Le Maître Phonetique", published as one of its ("", "Feature articles"); Armstrong implored the journal's readers to learn to use the extra symbols. Armstrong's "An English Phonetic Reader", Armstrong and Ward's "Handbook of English Intonation", and Ward's "The Phonetics of English" were the first to popularize this transcription system for English.

Armstrong's second book for the series was a <a href="Burmese%20language">Burmese</a> reader, co-written with the Burmese scholar <a href="Pe%20Maung%20Tin">Pe Maung Tin</a>. Pe Maung Tin had the opportunity to study phonetics at University College and collaborate with Armstrong while he was in London studying law at <a href="Inner%20Temple">Inner Temple</a> and attending lectures by <a href="Charles%20Otto%20Blagden">Charles Otto Blagden</a> about Old <a href="Mon%20language">Mon</a> inscriptions. Prior to the publication of the Burmese reader, Pe Maung Tin had written a Burmese specimen for "Le Maître Phonétique". Canadian American linguist <a href="William%20Cornyn">William Cornyn</a> described their reader as having an "elaborate description" of Burmese phonetics. Armstrong and Pe Maung Tin developed the first transcription system for Burmese in accordance to principles of the International Phonetic Association; this was a "very detailed" transcription scheme, which made use of five diacritics for tone, some of which could be placed at multiple heights.

One contemporary review of this book referred to the amount of specialized phonetic symbols and diacritics as a "profusion of diacritical marks that is rather confusing". Pe Maung Tin responded to this by clarifying the diacritics were necessary to convey the interaction of tone and <a href="prosody%20%28linguistics%29">prosody</a> and to ensure that English speakers did not read the texts with an English intonation. He also defended other transcription choices like using "" to represent an <a href="aspirated%20consonant">aspirated</a> <a href="voiceless%20alveolar%20fricative">alveolar fricative</a> as in the Burmese word (, "oil"), which Armstrong and Pe Maung Tin transcribed as ""; the reviewer thought it was confusing to use "" to refer to a sound other than the <a href="voiceless%20palato-alveolar%20sibilant">post-alveolar fricative</a> represented by the <a href="Sh%20%28digraph%29%23English">English</a> as in the word "she" (). R. Grant Brown, a former member of the <a href="Indian%20Civil%20Service%20%28British%20India%29">Indian Civil Service</a> in Burma, praised "A Burmese Phonetic Reader" for being the joint work of a phonetician and a native speaker, writing "This excellent little book sets a standard which other writers on living Oriental languages will have to follow if they do not wish their work to be regarded as second-rate", although he thought their transcription system was "too elaborate for ordinary use". British linguist John Rupert Firth used a broad transcription which he simplified from Armstrong and Pe Maung Tin's system based in part on his experience using their "Reader" with Burmese speakers and with students of Burmese phonetics at Oxford's <a href="Indian%20Institute">Indian Institute</a>. Burmese linguist <a href="Minn%20Latt">Minn Latt</a> said their transcription system used too many "unfamiliar symbols" for an ideal <a href="Romanization%20of%20Burmese">romanization scheme</a>. British linguist Justin Watkins used Armstrong and Pe Maung Tin's translation of <a href="The%20North%20Wind%20and%20the%20Sun%23Use%20in%20phonetic%20demonstrations">"The North Wind and the Sun"</a> for his 2001 illustration of the IPA for Burmese in the "<a href="Journal%20of%20the%20International%20Phonetic%20Association">Journal of the International Phonetic Association</a>".

Armstrong and her colleague Ida C. Ward published their book "Handbook of English Intonation" in 1926. It was accompanied by three double-sided <a href="gramophone%20record">gramophone record</a>s which consisted of Armstrong and Ward reading English passages. These recordings appeared in bibliographies of speech and theatre training for decades. Armstrong and Ward analyzed all English intonation patterns as essentially consisting of just two "Tunes": Tune 1 is typified by ending in a fall, and Tune 2 by ending in a rise. American linguist <a href="Kenneth%20Lee%20Pike">Kenneth Lee Pike</a> called their analysis "valuable" for learners of English because it found commonalities in the various uses of rising contours and of falling contours. In 1943, Danish linguist wrote "there is fairly general agreement" about the Tune 1 and Tune 2 classification; he also compares the Tune 1 and Tune 2 system of "Handbook of English Intonation" with the intonation classifications in "An Outline of English Phonetics" by Daniel Jones and "English Intonation" by <a href="Harold%20E.%20Palmer">Harold E. Palmer</a>.

Armstrong and Ward transcribed intonation in a system where lines and dots correspond to stressed and unstressed syllables, respectively, and vertical position corresponds to pitch. Their method of transcribing intonation was anticipated by the one used in H. S. Perera and Daniel Jones's (1919) reader for <a href="Sinhalese%20language">Sinhalese</a>, and the preface to "Handbook of English Intonation" notes an inspiration in Hermann Klinghardt's notation for intonation. Klinghardt said his book would have been impossible without Daniel Jones; his exercises also share similarities to Jones's intonation curves. Armstrong and Ward used a system of discrete dots and marks to mark the intonation contour because they found it easier for learners of English to follow than a continuous line.

"Handbook of English Intonation" had a lasting impact for decades, particularly in regards to <a href="Teaching%20English%20as%20a%20foreign%20language">teaching English</a>. Pike wrote that the work was "an influential contribution to the field"; in 1948, he described it as providing "the most widely-accepted analysis of British intonation". Armstrong and Ward's book remained in print and in use at least up until the 1970s. Despite its popularity, its analysis has been criticized for being overly simplistic. British phonetician <a href="Jack%20Windsor%20Lewis">Jack Windsor Lewis</a> wrote their handbook made "little or no advance in analysing the structure of English intonation", and criticised their system for notating intonation for having "so much superfluous detail". Pike wrote their tune-based intonation "proves insufficient to symbolize adequately (i.e. structurally) the intricate underlying system of contours in contrast one with another". Armstrong and Ward themselves wrote that they were aware there is "a greater wealth of detail than [is] here recorded", but that "attention has been concentrated on the simplest forms of intonation used in conversation and in the reading of narrative and descriptive prose" since the book's intended reader was a foreign learner of English.

In 1932 she wrote "The Phonetics of French: A Practical Handbook". Its stated goals are "to help English students of French pronunciation and especially teachers of French pronunciation". To this end, it contains various practice exercises and teaching hints. In the first chapter, she discusses techniques for French teachers to conduct ear-training exercises which were such an important part of her own teaching of phonetics. The influences of Daniel Jones's lectures on French phonetics can be seen in Armstrong's discussion of French <a href="rhotic%20consonant">rhotic</a> and <a href="stop%20consonant">stop</a> consonants. Armstrong's publication of this well-received book "widened the circle of her influence". In 1998, Scottish phonetician J. C. Catford wrote that he believed this book to still be the "best practical introduction to French phonetics".

Chapter XVII of "The Phonetics of French" was about intonation, but her main work on the topic was the 1934 book "Studies in French Intonation" co-written with her colleague Hélène Coustenoble. This book was written for English learners of French as well; it provided the first comprehensive description of French intonation. French intonation was also analyzed in terms of tunes; it was a configuration-based approach, where intonation consists of a sequence of discrete pitch contours. French intonation essentially consists of three contours in their analysis, namely: rise-falling, falling, and rising. Armstrong and Coustenoble made use of a prosodic unit known as a Sense Group, which they defined as "each of the smallest groups of grammatically related words into which many sentences may be divided". The book also provides discussion of English intonation in order to demonstrate how French intonation differs. One contemporary review noted that "it seems to have received a favourable reception" in England. The book contained numerous exercises, which led to another reviewer calling it "an excellent teaching manual" as well. Oxford linguist called the book "very useful" in 1936, Austrian philologist <a href="Elise%20Richter">Elise Richter</a> called it "an admirable achievement" in 1938, and American linguist <a href="Robert%20A.%20Hall%2C%20Jr.">Robert A. Hall, Jr.</a> called the book "excellent" in 1946. It has been later described as "highly idealized" for being based on conventions of reading French prose out loud. It is considered to be a "classic work on French intonation".

Armstrong started doing phonetic research on <a href="Somali%20language">Somali</a> in 1931. She published a Somali specimen for "Le Maître Phonétique" in 1933, as well as a translation of "The North Wind and the Sun" for the 1933 Italian version of "Principles of the International Phonetic Association," but her main work on Somali was "The Phonetic Structure of Somali", published in 1934. Her research was based on two <a href="Somalis">Somalis</a>, and she gives their names as "Mr. Isman Dubet of Adadleh, about 25 miles northeast of <a href="Hargeisa">Hargeisa</a>, and Mr. Haji Farah of <a href="Berbera">Berbera</a>"; in <a href="Somali%20Latin%20alphabet">Somali orthography</a>, these names would be and . These men were apparently sailors living in the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End of London</a>, and Armstrong likely worked with them from 1931 to 1933. Farah's pronunciation had been the basis for Armstrong's 1933 specimen, and he had also been the subject for a <a href="radiography">radiographic</a> phonetic study conducted by UCL phonetician Stephen Jones.

Armstrong's analysis influenced a report by the Somalists <a href="Bogumi%C5%82%20Andrzejewski">Bogumił Andrzejewski</a> and <a href="Musa%20Haji%20Ismail%20Galal">Musa Haji Ismail Galal</a>, which in turn influenced Somali linguist <a href="Shire%20Jama%20Ahmed">Shire Jama Ahmed</a>'s successful proposal for the <a href="Somali%20Latin%20alphabet">Somali Latin alphabet</a>. In particular, Andrzejewski gave credit to her for the practice of doubled vowels to represent long vowels in Somali. Andrzejweski mentioned some disadvantages of Armstrong's orthography proposal with respect to vowels, writing that "Armstrong's system is too narrow to deal with the fluctuations in the extents of Vowel Harmony and so rigid that its symbols often imply pauses (or absence of pauses) and a particular speed and style of pronunciation". He also claimed that Armstrong's orthographic proposal for Somali vowels would be "too difficult for the general public (both Somali and non-Somali) to handle".

In 1981, American phonologist <a href="Larry%20Hyman">Larry Hyman</a> called Armstrong's paper "pioneering"; she was the first to thoroughly examine tone or pitch in Somali. She analyzed Somali as being a tone language with four tones: high level, mid level, low level, and falling, and she provided a list of <a href="minimal%20pairs">minimal pairs</a> which are distinguished by tone. German Africanist responded to Armstrong's work in a 1949 paper He called Armstrong's work "an excellent phonetic study", but argued that Somali was not a true tone language but rather a stress language. Andrzejewski wrote in 1956 that Armstrong's phonetic data were "more accurate than those of any other author on Somali"; he analyzed Somali as being "a border-line case between a tone language and a stress language", making use of what he called "accentual features". There remains a debate as to whether Somali should be considered a tone language or a pitch accent language.

Armstrong was the first to describe the vowel system of Somali. A 2014 bibliography on the Somali language called Armstrong's paper "seminal" and notes she provides a more detailed description of Somali vowels than other works. She was also the first to discuss <a href="vowel%20harmony">vowel harmony</a> in Somali; her vowel harmony analysis was praised by Italian Somalist . Australian British linguist <a href="Roy%20Clive%20Abraham">Roy Clive Abraham</a> wrote that he agreed with Armstrong on most parts regarding Somali phonetics: "there are very few points where I disagree with her". Austro-Hungarian linguist <a href="Werner%20Vycichl">Werner Vycichl</a> wrote that Armstrong's study "opens a new chapter of African studies". In 1992, <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Dublin">Trinity College, Dublin</a> linguist John Ibrahim Saeed said Armstrong's paper was "even now the outstanding study of Somali phonetics", and in 1996, <a href="Martin%20Orwin">Martin Orwin</a> wrote that it "remains essential reading for anyone interested in pursuing any aspect of the sound system of Somali".

Armstrong wrote a brief sketch of <a href="Kikuyu%20language">Kikuyu</a> phonetics for the book "Practical Phonetics for Students of African Languages" by <a href="Diedrich%20Westermann">Diedrich Westermann</a> and Ida C. Ward. Her <a href="informant%20%28linguistics%29">linguistic consultant</a> was a man whom she refers to as Mr. Mockiri. She also wrote a sketch on <a href="Luganda">Luganda</a> phonetics for this book. Her main work on Kikuyu was "The Phonetic and Tonal Structure of Kikuyu" published posthumously in 1940. <a href="Jomo%20Kenyatta">Jomo Kenyatta</a>, who would later become the first <a href="President%20of%20Kenya">President</a> of <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, was Armstrong's linguistic consultant for this book. He was employed by the Phonetics Department from 1935 to 1937 in order for Armstrong to carry out her research; this was while Kenyatta was studying <a href="social%20anthropology">social anthropology</a> at the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Economics">London School of Economics</a> under <a href="Bronis%C5%82aw%20Malinowski">Bronisław Malinowski</a>. The book was largely finished when Armstrong died; only Chapter XXII "Tonal Forms of Adjectives" remained to be written, although Armstrong had already written notes for it. Daniel Jones entrusted Beatrice Honikman to write the remaining chapter and finalize the book's preparations for its 1940 publication; she was a Lecturer at <a href="SOAS%2C%20University%20of%20London">SOAS</a> who had earlier done work on Kikuyu with Kenyatta, and she was also once Armstrong's student. Chapter IV "The Consonant Phonemes" contains twelve <a href="kymograph">kymograph</a> tracings of Kikuyu words to illustrate phonetic details; the phonetic kymograph was an important instrument for experimental phonetic research at University College under Jones.

The book contains an appendix in which Armstrong proposes an orthography for Kikuyu. She suggested that the <a href="voiced%20dental%20fricative">voiced dental fricative</a> be represented by and the <a href="prenasalized">prenasalized</a> plosive by ; in parallel were the pairs / and / . Westermann and Ward also advocated the use of for in their book. Kenyatta thought Kikuyu people would not accept the use of for because in the other orthographies Kikuyu people would be familiar with, namely English and <a href="Swahili%20language">Swahili</a>, represents a <a href="stop%20consonant">stop consonant</a>, not a fricative; Armstrong noted there did not seem to be any objection to using and to represent fricatives in Kikuyu orthography even though they represent stops in English. The use of for has also been criticised as there is no <a href="alternation%20%28linguistics%29">alternation</a> between and in Kikuyu unlike the other two pairs; furthermore the Kikuyu voiced dental fricative phonologically patterns with voiceless fricatives instead of with other voiced ones.

Armstrong also proposed that the seven vowels of Kikuyu be represented by the IPA symbols ; this followed the practical orthography, now known as the <a href="Africa%20Alphabet">Africa Alphabet</a>, devised by the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures. This system avoided the use of diacritics which Armstrong called "tiresome", and which often were omitted when writing. A drawback to this system is that it is less faithful to etymology and obscures the relationship with related languages. Kikuyu leaders also disliked the use of the specialized phonetic symbols and , finding them impractical since they could not easily be written on a typewriter. Armstrong also proposed that the <a href="velar%20nasal">velar nasal</a> be written with the letter and that the <a href="palatal%20nasal">palatal nasal</a> be written with the digraph (although she wrote she personally would prefer the letter ). The education authorities in Kenya briefly recommended that schools use Armstrong's system. In modern Kikuyu orthography, the voiced dental fricative is written , the velar and palatal nasals are respectively as and , and the vowels are respectively written .

Armstrong's book provided the first in-depth description of tone in any East African <a href="Bantu%20language">Bantu language</a>. Throughout the book, Armstrong represented tone with a pictorial system; a benefit of this method was that she did not need to have a tonemic analysis. A sequence of dashes at varying heights and angles accompanied each word or sentence throughout the book. Armstrong's description of Kikuyu tone involved grouping <a href="word%20stem">stems</a> into tone classes; each tone class was defined in terms of its tonal <a href="allomorphy">allomorphy</a> depending on surrounding context. Subclasses were based on properties like length or structure of the stem. Armstrong discussed five tone classes for verbs, named Tonal Class I–V, and a small group of verbs which do not belong to any of those five classes, seven tone classes for nouns, each named after a word in that class, e.g., the ' Tonal Class ( "person"), and three tone classes for adjectives, each named after a stem in that class, e.g., the ' Tonal Class ( "good").

American Canadian linguist William J. Samarin noted Armstrong conflated tone and intonation for the most part; he claimed this led to "exaggerated complexities" in her description, particularly with respect to the final intonational fall in interrogatives. When Armstrong wrote her manuscript, analysis of tone was a nascent field and the complex relationship between phonemic tonemes and phonetic pitch led phoneticians to analyze languages as having large numbers of tones. In 1952, SOAS linguist Lyndon Harries was able to take Armstrong's data and analyze Kikuyu tone as only having two underlying tone levels. American linguist <a href="Mary%20Louise%20Pratt">Mary Louise Pratt</a> also re-analyzed Armstrong's Kikuyu data as only having two levels. Pratt also noted Armstrong did not distinguish <a href="allophonic">allophonic</a>ally long vowels from vowels which are <a href="phonemic">phonemic</a>ally long. University of Nairobi linguist Kevin C. Ford wrote that if Armstrong had not died before completing this book "there is no doubt she could have expanded her range of data and probably presented some rigorous analysis, which is sadly lacking in the published work". The American phonologist <a href="Nick%20Clements">Nick Clements</a> described Armstrong's book in a 1984 paper as "an extremely valuable source of information due to the comprehensiveness of its coverage and accuracy of the author's phonetic observations".

Armstrong married Simon Charles Boyanus (; 8 July 1871 – 19 July 1952) on 24 September 1926, although she still continued to go by "Miss Armstrong" professionally after marriage. Boyanus was a professor of <a href="English%20philology">English philology</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Leningrad">University of Leningrad</a>, where he worked with Russian linguist <a href="Lev%20Shcherba">Lev Shcherba</a>. He came to the University College Phonetics Department in 1925, where he spent eight months learning English phonetics under Armstrong.

After marriage, Boyanus had to return to the Soviet Union for eight years, while Armstrong had to stay in England. While away, Boyanus worked with <a href="Vladimir%20M%C3%BCller">Vladimir Müller</a> to produce English–Russian and Russian–English dictionaries. Armstrong assisted with the phonetic transcription for the keywords in the English–Russian volume. She was able to visit Boyanus in <a href="Leningrad">Leningrad</a> on two occasions, and he was able to briefly return to London in 1928. Boyanus was finally able to permanently move to England in January 1934, whereupon he became a lecturer in Russian and Phonetics at the <a href="UCL%20School%20of%20Slavonic%20and%20East%20European%20Studies">School of Slavonic and East European Studies</a> at the University of London. While working at University College, Armstrong lived in <a href="Forest%20Gate">Forest Gate</a> and <a href="Church%20End%2C%20Finchley">Church End, Finchley</a>.

In November 1937, Armstrong became sick with a persistent bout of <a href="influenza">influenza</a>. Her condition worsened, and she had a <a href="stroke">stroke</a>. She died at <a href="Finchley%20Memorial%20Hospital">Finchley Memorial Hospital</a>, <a href="Middlesex">Middlesex</a> on 9 December 1937, at the age of 55. There was a service for her at <a href="Golders%20Green%20Crematorium">Golders Green Crematorium</a> at noon on 13 December. The University College Provost, Secretary, and Tutor to Women Students were among those present at her funeral. Her <a href="obituary">obituary</a> was printed in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>", "", the "Annual Report" for University College, and other journals; her death was also reported in "<a href="Transactions%20of%20the%20Philological%20Society">Transactions of the Philological Society</a>", among other publications.

In early 1938, when her widower Simon Boyanus brought up the possibility of publishing Armstrong's Kikuyu manuscript, Daniel Jones arranged for Beatrice Honikman to see it through to publication. Jones was reportedly "deeply affected" by Armstrong's death; he wrote Armstrong's obituary for "", and his preface to "The Phonetic Structure of Kikuyu" paid homage to her life. When the University College phonetics library had to be restocked after being bombed in World War II during <a href="the%20London%20Blitz">the London Blitz</a>, Jones donated a copy of Armstrong's posthumously published book "as a fitting start in the reconstruction of the Phonetics Departmental Library".

The Boat Races 2015

The 2015 Boat Races took place on 11 April 2015. Held annually, <a href="The%20Boat%20Race">The Boat Race</a> is a <a href="Rowing%20%28sport%29%23Side%20by%20side">side-by-side rowing</a> race between male crews from the Universities of <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a> along a tidal stretch of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> in south-west London. For the first time in the history of the event, the men's, <a href="Women%27s%20Boat%20Race">women's</a> and both reserves' races were all held on the <a href="Tideway">Tideway</a>; in the men's reserve race, Cambridge's <a href="Goldie%20%28Cambridge%20University%20Boat%20Club%29">Goldie</a> faced Oxford's Isis after the women's race, as a preliminary to the main men's race, while the women's reserve race, held the day before, saw Oxford's Osiris race against Cambridge's Blondie. 

Oxford's women won the first running of the Women's Boat Race on the Tideway, and the 70th overall, by six and a half lengths, to take the overall record in the event to 41–29 in Cambridge's favour. Oxford also won the men's reserve race, with Isis winning by three lengths. In the main men's race, umpired by the six-time <a href="Blue%20%28university%20sport%29">Blue</a> <a href="Boris%20Rankov">Boris Rankov</a>, Oxford won by six and a half lengths in a time of 17 minutes 34 seconds, taking the <a href="List%20of%20The%20Boat%20Race%20results">overall record</a> in the event to 81–79 in Cambridge's favour. The women's reserve race was won by Oxford's Osiris by fifteen lengths, making the overall record 21–20 in Cambridge's favour.

<a href="The%20Boat%20Race">The Boat Race</a> is a <a href="Rowing%20%28sport%29%23Side%20by%20side">side-by-side rowing</a> competition between the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a> (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues") and the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues"). First held in 1829, the race takes place on the <a href="The%20Championship%20Course">Championship Course</a>, between <a href="Putney">Putney</a> and <a href="Mortlake">Mortlake</a> on the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> in south-west London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide. Oxford went into the race as champions, having won the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%202014">2014 race</a> by a margin of eleven lengths, but Cambridge led overall with 81 victories to Oxford's 78 (excluding the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201877">"dead heat to Oxford by five feet" of 1877</a>).

It was the first time in the history of The Boat Race that the three main races, the men's, women's and men's reserves', were held on the same day and on the same course along the <a href="Tideway">Tideway</a>. Prior to this year, the women's race which first took place in 1927, was usually held at the <a href="Henley%20Boat%20Races">Henley Boat Races</a> along the course. However, on at least two occasions in the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>, the women competed on the Thames between Chiswick and Kew. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the <a href="Women%27s%20Boat%20Race%202014">2014 race</a> by four lengths, with Cambridge leading 41–28 overall. For the third year, the men's race was sponsored by <a href="The%20Bank%20of%20New%20York%20Mellon">BNY Mellon</a> while the women's race saw BNY Mellon's subsidiary Newton Investment Management as sponsors. It was part of the sponsorship deal with Newton Investment Management that mandated the women's race to be rowed on the same course and with the same funding as the men's race. According to their chief executive, Helena Morrissey, the company "didn't just want a name on a shirt; [it] wanted to do something meaningful". The women's race was scheduled to take place at 4:50 pm, the men's reserves' race half an hour later and the men's race a further half-hour after that at 5:50 pm. The women's reserve race between Cambridge's Blondie and Oxford's Osiris took place on the Tideway for the first time, one day before the main races, at 4:05 pm.
The television historian and former Oxford rower <a href="Dan%20Snow">Dan Snow</a> (who represented the Dark Blues in the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201999">1999</a>, <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%202000">2000</a> and <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%202001">2001 races</a>) said: "Most televised sport is a carnival of misogyny so it is great news that the Boat Race is leading the way in ensuring that women take their rightful place alongside men." The BBC sports broadcaster <a href="Eleanor%20Oldroyd">Eleanor Oldroyd</a> suggested that scheduling the races on the same course and day was "a game-changing move" for female sport, and "now they've achieved equality – same course, same distance, same , same BBC TV coverage, to an expected global audience of 100 million". The television presenter <a href="Clare%20Balding">Clare Balding</a> opted to cover the women's race instead of the <a href="2015%20Grand%20National">2015 Grand National</a>, claiming that the combined rowing event would have a "ripple effect all across society, business and sport".

The autumn reception was held at the London headquarters of BNY Mellon. As Oxford had won the previous year's race, it was Cambridge's responsibility to offer the traditional challenge to the Dark Blues. To that end, Alexander Leichter and Caroline Reid, presidents of the Cambridge boat clubs, challenged <a href="Constantine%20Louloudis">Constantine Louloudis</a> and Anastasia Chitty, their counterparts, who duly accepted. Umpires for the senior races were announced on 4 March: the former Cambridge rower Simon Harris, who represented the Light Blues in the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201982">1982</a> and <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201983">1983 races</a> oversaw the Women's race, while the six-time Oxford Blue Boris Rankov umpired the men's race for the fourth time. Rob Clegg, the umpire of the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%202011">2011 race</a> oversaw the men's reserve race while the Olympic bronze medallist <a href="Sarah%20Winckless">Sarah Winckless</a> umpired the women's reserve race.

The Cambridge men's crew coaching team was led by their Chief Coach <a href="Steve%20Trapmore">Steve Trapmore</a>. Appointed to the post in 2010, Trapmore was a gold medal-winning member of the <a href="Rowing%20at%20the%202000%20Summer%20Olympics%23Men%27s%20events">men's eight</a> at the <a href="2000%20Summer%20Olympics">2000 Summer Olympics</a>. He was assisted by Ed Green, the former head coach at <a href="University%20College%20Cork">University College Cork</a> and development coach at <a href="Molesey%20Boat%20Club">Molesey Boat Club</a>. Green's primary responsibility will be to coach Goldie. Mark Beer, former Cambridge University Boat Club assistant coach, was appointed as the development coach for the Light Blues. Sean Bowden returned as Chief Coach for Oxford, having been responsible for the senior men's crew since 1997. He was a former Great Britain Olympic coach and coached the Light Blues in the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201993">1993</a> and <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201994">1994 Boat Races</a>. His assistant coach was Andy Nelder who has coached the senior boat since 2006.

Oxford's women's Head Coach was the Canadian Christine Wilson who had previously assisted in coaching the United States Olympic team and held the position of Head Coach of women's rowing at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>. She was assisted by Natasha Townsend who had represented Great Britain in the women's eights at two Olympics. Cambridge were coached by the former Goldie coach Rob Baker who was assisted by Paddy Ryan and Nick Acock, along with two guest coaches in Jonathan Condor and Annie Vernon; Ed Hallam was their strength and conditioning coach.

The trials took place on The Championship Course on 9 December 2014, in each case being the first and only time the crews would have to practice the route while racing side-by-side. Both races were umpired by Simon Harris in windy conditions.

<a href="Oxford%20University%20Women%27s%20Boat%20Club">Oxford University Women's Boat Club</a>'s (OUWBC) trial eights, "Real Life" and "Fantasy", set off at 1:15 p.m. "Real Life", starting from the Middlesex station, made a better start and were three seats ahead at the Town Buoy before holding a length's lead after the first bend. Following a warning from Harris as the crews approached <a href="Hammersmith%20Bridge">Hammersmith Bridge</a>, the lead was reduced to half-a-length around the Surrey bend. "Fantasy" allowed "Real Life" to take a clear water advantage by the Bandstand, and they pulled away at <a href="Barnes%20Railway%20Bridge">Barnes Bridge</a> to win by three lengths. The Oxford coach Christine Wilson noted that "today the crews pushed each other to know the course and to take risks when a racing opportunity presents itself".

The two boats in the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Women%27s%20Boat%20Club">Cambridge University Women's Boat Club</a> (CUWBC) trials were denoted as "Rise" and "Grind", with the race commencing at 2:30 p.m. Starting from the Surrey station, "Rise", despite the lower <a href="stroke%20rate">stroke rate</a>, were half a length ahead within the first 20 strokes, and held a length's lead by <a href="Craven%20Cottage">Craven Cottage</a>. They gradually extended their lead to two lengths by Hammersmith Bridge, three by Chiswick Steps and finished five lengths ahead of "Grind". Cambridge's coach Rob Baker was mildly disappointed but remained upbeat, suggesting "Though I would have liked a closer race, I saw some excellent performances".

The men's trials took place along The Championship Course on 11 December 2014, and according to the author Chris Dodd, were held in conditions "perfect ... for coaches in the process of testing their men and trying to seat people in the right order." Both races were umpired by Boris Rankov, the former Oxford <a href="Blue%20%28university%20sport%29">Blue</a> who rowed for the Dark Blues on a record six occasions.

Cambridge's senior men's trial boats were called "63" and "Not Out" in honour of the Australian <a href="Test%20cricket">Test cricket</a>er <a href="Phillip%20Hughes">Phillip Hughes</a> who had died earlier in the year after being struck in the neck by a <a href="Bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncer</a> during a domestic match. "Not Out" made the better start but lost their <a href="Canvas%20%28rowing%29">canvas-length</a> lead by Barn Elms, and the crews passed the Mile Post level. Shooting Hammersmith Bridge, "63" were half a length down, and a length-and-a-half down by Chiswick Steps. "Not Out" held a two-length lead by the time the crews passed under Barnes Bridge which they extended to two-and-three-quarters by the finishing post. Dodd described the race as "epic", while senior coach Trapmore expressed his contentment with the trial suggesting "it is an invaluable exercise."

The Oxford trial saw "Per Terram" line up against "Per Mare", so named to commemorate the 350th anniversary of the foundation of the <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a> whose motto is "Per Mare, Per Terram" ("By sea, by land"). "Per Terram", <a href="stroke%20%28rowing%29">stroked</a> by the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Boat%20Club">Oxford University Boat Club</a> president Louloudis, took an early lead and were half-a-length ahead before "Per Mare" recovered the deficit to be level by Barn Elms. A spurt from "Per Terram" at the Mile Post saw them regain the lead but at <a href="Harrods%20Furniture%20Depository">Harrods Furniture Depository</a>, "Per Mare" took the lead back, shooting Hammersmith Bridge precisely and holding a three-quarter length lead by <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20School%2C%20London">St Paul's School</a>. Both crews experienced fierce winds with "Per Terram" coping better and taking a half-length advantage. "Per Mare" kept in touch through to Barnes Bridge but "Per Terram" pushed on and passed the finishing post with a winning margin of two lengths. Oxford's coach Bowden was cautious, stating that the "trial shows that Oxford is in good shape, but this race is not the only bit of the trials process". Dodd described the race as "cracking".

On 25 January 2015, a CUWBC crew raced against a crew from <a href="Newcastle%20University%20Boat%20Club">Newcastle University Boat Club</a> along three sections of the Championship Course. Cambridge won all three races with relative ease, and their boat club president Reid, rowing at number four, reflected that it had been "a useful experience". Cambridge raced against an <a href="Imperial%20College%20Boat%20Club">Imperial College Boat Club</a> crew on 8 March over two sections of the Tideway course, first between the start and Hammersmith Bridge, before racing between the Mile Post and Chiswick Steps. The first leg was declared to be too close to call by the umpire Simon Harris, while the second ended in a two-thirds length victory to the Light Blues. OUWBC raced against Molesey Boat Club on 21 February 2015, in three stages on the Tideway, and comfortably won each race. This was followed by a race against Imperial College Boat Club on 22 March over three sections of the Thames. Imperial were waterlogged in the first piece, but Oxford easily won the second and third races.

OUWBC were rescued by the <a href="Royal%20National%20Lifeboat%20Institution">Royal National Lifeboat Institution</a> (RNLI) on the Thames on 1 April 2015 after becoming waterlogged in rough conditions. They were inadvertently discovered stranded during an RNLI exercise. Prior to race day, Rachel Quarrell, the former Oxford <a href="Coxswain">cox</a> (who steered OUWBC in the 1991 race) writing in "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" noted that "since the start of this season the Oxford women have been notably faster".

On 16 March 2015, CUBC raced in two pieces along the Tideway against a <a href="Leander%20Club">Leander Club</a> crew steered by Oxford's <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%202012">2012 race</a> cox Zoe De Toledo. Cambridge won the first race, from the Boat Race start to the top of <a href="Chiswick%20Eyot">Chiswick Eyot</a>, by two and a half lengths, and the second, between the Eyot and Mortlake by four lengths. OUBC faced a crew from Molesey Boat Club in three races along the Tideway five days later. Despite Imperial being given a head start in two of the three races, Oxford won all three pieces relatively easily. The same day, Cambridge faced a Netherlands Eight in two races on the Thames. The Light Blues easily won the first race, but finished the second level against "experienced and accomplished opposition."

The official weigh-in for both women's and men's crews took place at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts">Royal Academy of Arts</a> on 19 March 2015, hosted by Clare Balding.
The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 11 <a href="Stone%20%28unit%29">st</a> 6 <a href="Pound%20%28mass%29">lb</a> 2 <a href="Ounce">oz</a> (72.5 kg), per rower more than their opponents. Oxford saw four rowers with Boat Race experience return, including <a href="Bow%20%28rowing%29">bow</a> Maxie Sheske and Anastasia Chitty who was making her third appearances in the event. Cambridge's crew included three former Blues in Caroline Reid, Claire Watkins and Melissa Wilson (who was also making her third appearance in the event). Oxford's stroke, the American <a href="Caryn%20Davies">Caryn Davies</a>, was a three-time Olympic medallist, having taken silver in the women's coxed eights at the <a href="2004%20Summer%20Olympics">2004 Summer Olympics</a> and gold at both the <a href="2008%20Summer%20Olympics">2008</a> and <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a>. Cambridge's cox Rosemary Ostfeld steered Goldie the previous year. Over the Easter weekend, Oxford switched their number five and seven, moving Nadine Graedel Iberg behind stroke. Cambridge swapped bow for stroke, switching Hannah Evans for Fanny Belais.
The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 14 st 4 lb 11 oz (90.8 kg), per rower more than their opponents. Oxford saw four rowers with Boat Race experience return, including number seven Sam O'Connor and <a href="stroke%20%28rowing%29">stroke</a> Louloudis who made their third consecutive appearances in the event. Louloudis was an Olympic bronze medallist, having stroked Great Britain to third place in the <a href="Rowing%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20eight">men's eight</a> at the 2012 Summer Olympics. The New Zealand brothers Sam and James O'Connor were the first siblings to row in the event since the <a href="Winklevoss%20twins">Winklevoss twins</a> represented Oxford in the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%202010">2010 race</a>. Cambridge's crew contained five Blues who participated in the 2014 race, including their cox Ian Middleton. During "Tideway week", James Mountain replaced James O'Connor, the latter suffering from illness. On O'Connor's return to the boat, he was switched with Thomas Swartz at number two.

Over 250,000 spectators lined the Thames to watch the three races. Around eighty people needed to be rescued as the river level rose from the high tide and the wake of the flotilla.
The women's reserve race, the 41st since 1968, was contested between Oxford's Osiris and Cambridge's Blondie on 10 April 2015. Osiris won by 15 lengths in a time of 18 minutes 58 seconds, their fourth consecutive victory and thirteenth win in the past fifteen years. It took the overall record in the event to 21–20 in CUWBC's favour.
The men's reserve race was the 51st contest between Isis and Goldie, and started at 5:20 p.m. on 11 April 2015. The overall record in the event stood at 29–21 in Goldie's favour. The Light Blue reserves won the <a href="coin%20flipping">toss</a> and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Isis. Goldie took an early lead, despite warnings from the umpire around Barn Elms, and Isis were behind by five seconds at Hammersmith Bridge. Coming round to St Paul's School, both crews came into a strong head wind and Isis rating 34 to Goldie's 36 began to close the gap. The crews were level by the Bandstand, but Isis had taken a half length lead by Barnes Bridge, and they pulled away again to win by three lengths. 
This was the fifth consecutive victory for Isis, taking the overall event to 29–22 in Cambridge's favour.
The women's race was the 70th contest between OUWBC and CUWBC, and started at 4:50 p.m. on 11 April 2015. The overall record in the event before the race stood at 41–28 in Cambridge's favour, but Oxford were considered favourites to win. Prior to the race, The Boat Race Company Limited announced that the two boats had been named to honour this auspicious occasion. Cambridge elected to name their boat "Project Ely" while Oxford had opted for "Catalyst". OUWBC won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to CUWBC. The conditions were sunny but very windy. OUWBC took an immediate lead and were five seconds ahead at the Mile Post. Despite out-rating their opponents, Cambridge failed to make any ground on Oxford, and were around three lengths down by St Paul's School. Approaching Barnes Bridge, Oxford's cox called for a push, and OUWBC passed below the central arch with a substantial lead. OUWBC won by a margin of six and a half lengths in a time of 19 minutes 45 seconds, taking the overall record to 41–29 in Cambridge's favour.
The men's race was the 161st contest between OUBC and CUBC, and was held at 5:50 p.m on 11 April 2015. Prior to the race, the overall record in the event stood at 81–78 in Cambridge's favour, with one dead heat. The Dark Blues went into the race as the "strongest favourites in the history of the race". Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford. Oxford made the better start and were quickly ahead, with a quarter-length lead after a minute. Cambridge drew back into contention and held a canvas lead after two minutes where both crews were warned by Rankov as they closed. Cambridge marginally out-rated the Dark Blues as Oxford took a slight lead and were one second ahead by the Mile Post. Rankov issued further warnings as the crews passed beside Harrods Furniture Depository, Oxford half a length ahead, but with the Light Blues holding the advantage of the bend in the river as they approached Hammersmith Bridge.

Cambridge failed to make the best of the bend, and Oxford went clear after a push, taking an additional half a length and crossed in front of the Light Blues nine minutes into the race. The Dark Blues were over a length clear by the end of Chiswick Eyot and continued to pull away, holding a seven-second lead by Chiswick Steps. Passing through Barnes Bridge, Oxford were around five lengths ahead. Oxford passed the finishing post six and a half lengths ahead in a winning time of 17 minutes 34 seconds. It was the Dark Blues' third consecutive victory and took the overall record in the event to 81–79 in Cambridge's favour.
The trophies were presented to the winning crews by the five-time Olympic gold medallist <a href="Steve%20Redgrave">Steve Redgrave</a>. OUWBC's winning president Chitty said "It's a really special moment, something I've been working towards for three years" while her counterpart Reid accepted that Cambridge "didn't get off to [their] best start and Oxford did" and that the conditions were "pretty horrendous around the halfway mark with the wind against the tide and some pretty high waves". Oxford's stroke Davies said: "I'm so glad we can be role models to all the young women out there." Cambridge's coach Baker noted "We’ve got a young crew that has come a long way and they raced their best ... We’ve improved quite a lot, but it just wasn’t good enough".

The Cambridge's men's president Leichter was generous in defeat: "It was 100% fair. It was very painful but they took us round the outside of Surrey and we couldn't respond" while four-time winner Louloudis was content: "We stuck to our plan and executed a really good race". Oxford's coach Bowden said of his eleven victories with the Dark Blues in the event, "they are all different and tough but we came together well". He went on to honour the former Oxford coach <a href="Daniel%20Topolski">Dan Topolski</a> who had died in February: "We definitely had Dan in our hearts throughout the campaign and we’re just so pleased to have won in style for him".
